			<p><P> August 28, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> TROUBLE IN AVALON;  </P> <P> BUT PLANS AFOOT TO HELP WITH CROWDS, HOUSING  </P> <P> By boat, the view approaching this tourist town presents a trio of vivid  images, each rising from the morning mists like a post card come to life.  </P> <P> First, the Hamilton Cove condominiums emerge on the horizon, tier upon tier of  gleaming white buildings hewn into a hillside of the rugged Santa Catalina  Island terrain.  </P> <P> Then, the landmark Casino Ballroom, a round, domed Art Deco-style structure,  comes into view, perched on a showy vantage point of land jutting into the blue  Pacific.  </P> <P> Finally, rounding the curve into Avalon Bay, the town itself unfolds, exuding  Old World charm and a Mediterranean-like ambiance. Picturesque houses with  red-tiled roofs line the steep, winding streets, overlooking a white sand beach  and a boat-filled harbor.  </P> <P> Once ashore, Avalon lives up to its idyllic image.  </P> <P> It is a town where many residents are on a first-name basis and where  townspeople pick up their mail at the post office because there are too few  addresses to justify the expense of home mail delivery.  </P> <P> Crescent Avenue, a pedestrian mall of souvenir shops and restaurants with  quaint names like Buoys and Gulls and the Busy Bee, retains a small-town  flavor, though year-round residents tend to avoid it in summer months because  of the throngs of tourists.  </P> <P> But even in picture-perfect Avalon, there are problems.  </P> <P> In surveys conducted over the last year by the Santa Catalina Island Co.,  residents and visitors alike identified a number of ways that life in Avalon  could be improved.  </P> <P> Basically, the city of about 2,500 is bursting at the seams.  </P> <P> Avalon suffers from a shortage of housing for permanent residents, and would-be  workers in the year-round tourist industry often have trouble finding a place  to live.  </P> <P> Traffic congestion and a lack of parking spaces are critical issues. Even  though many residents tool around the hilly streets in space-saving golf carts,  and the city strictly limits the numbers of cars and other vehicles, summer  traffic often collects in bottlenecks at downtown intersections.  </P> <P> </P> <P> "Overtown" Tourists  </P> <P> For residents, tourism is both an economic boon and a hindrance of day-to-day  life. As many as 15,000 tourists from "overtown," as the mainland is called,  flood the 1.25-square-mile town daily, providing big profits for Avalon  merchants but straining the town's already taxed fresh-water resources, streets  and sewer system.  </P> <P> Twice weekly, the tourist tide swells when cruise ships are moored offshore and  hundreds of vacationers are ferried to the Pleasure Pier for a few hurried  hours of sightseeing.  </P> <P> Longtime Avalon resident John W. R. Windle, who arrived on the island as a  6-year-old in 1910, reveres Avalon's small-town charms but says the city's  growth and its increasing popularity as a year-round tourist attraction cause  headaches for permanent residents.  </P> <P> "Some things need fixing, there's no doubt about it," said Windle, 85. "And  it's getting more commercial, it really is. Sometimes, I get to feel like a  stranger in my own town."  </P> <P> To ease the problems, officials at the Santa Catalina Island Co. have unveiled  a sweeping, 15-year plan aimed at redeveloping much of Avalon in three-year  phases.  </P> <P> The plan -- still at a conceptual stage -- is intended to address some of the  most pressing issues facing Avalon, including lack of year-round housing and a  water supply so limited that saltwater is used to flush toilets and to douse  fires.  </P> <P> The plan proposes new moderate-cost apartments and homes for year-round  residents, a new transportation center to consolidate ticket-buying and other  travel functions now spread over the town, a desalination plant, three new  hotels with a total of about 200 new rooms, and a general sprucing-up of  Avalon's streets and parks.  </P> <P> Island officials are uncertain how much it will cost to implement the plan and  how any future development costs will be divided among the island company, the  city and private developers. A desalination plant that purifies water will  alone cost roughly $3 million, officials estimate.  </P> <P> Many residents, while acknowledging that the changes are overdue, say they want  to preserve Avalon's small-town quality.  </P> <P> Therein, island company officials say, lies a major dilemma: how to upgrade  Avalon without altering its charm.  </P> <P> "Avalon's now 75 years old, and a lot of the things that were convenient and  appropriate 75 years ago are no longer convenient and appropriate," said island  company vice president Ron Doutt. "They are, as a matter of fact, contributing  to these problems."  </P> <P> Santa Catalina Island was purchased in 1919 by the family of chewing gum  magnate William Wrigley Jr. through the island company. The company now owns  about two-thirds of the land in Avalon and about 20% of the city's buildings.  In 1975, the company deeded about 86% of the island to the nonprofit Catalina  Conservancy, which maintains the pristine interior.  </P> <P> Some of Avalon's buildings -- such as City Hall, a wood frame, stucco-covered  structure built around 1917 into a steep hillside -- date from the early part  of the century. Office space at City Hall, for example, is so limited that some  city workers share desks in the council chambers, which holds a maximum of 36  people.  </P> <P> Space is at an even greater premium at the Avalon fire station, across from  City Hall on Metropole Avenue.  </P> <P> "Oh, it's unbelievable," said Fire Chief Jack Goslin. "We don't even have a  ramp to pull out the trucks and work on them." During daily maintenance checks,  the trucks must be pulled out onto Metropole, partially blocking the  thoroughfare, he said.  </P> <P> A new fire station -- proposed for a site on Avalon Canyon Road near the school  and Avalon Municipal Hospital -- could provide training space for the  department's 25 volunteer firefighters, Goslin said.  </P> <P> "I would love to see it done," he said.  </P> <P> A few residents have expressed dismay that the plans will take 15 years to  complete. "It's not fast enough," one resident wrote on an island company  survey.  </P> <P> But Mayor Hugh T. (Bud) Smith called the plan "workable and doable" and said he  supports the island company's plan to proceed "a step at a time."  </P> <P> Island company officials say developing the project over 15 years will minimize  disruption to Avalon's tourists and residents. The plans call for:  </P> <P> * Building 50 units of housing a year over 15 years. The additional housing is  planned for three locations: Las Casitas, the site of a former bungalow-style  hotel where the Chicago Cubs held spring training until 1951, now used as  housing for island company employees; Bird Park Canyon, the site of a former  aviary, once the home of a private collection of exotic birds, and Quail  Canyon, on the outskirts of Avalon.  </P> <P> * Building a civic center, including a new City Hall, fire station and day-care  facilities, on part of the 7-acre Las Casitas site.  </P> <P> * Building a desalination plant near the Southern California Edison power plant  on Pebbly Beach Road to provide a source of fresh water for new homes and  apartments.  </P> <P> * Building three hotels, including a high-quality hotel and public-access beach  at Descanso Bay, a 16-acre site between the Casino Ballroom and the Hamilton  Cove condominium development. A second hotel would be built near a city park at  the western end of Crescent Avenue, the town's main street. Also, the Atwater  Hotel would be razed to make room for a new hotel.  </P> <P> * Making land owned by the island company available for lease and eventual  purchase by permanent residents to build single-family homes.  </P> <P> * Establishing a central commercial area for residents, to include a new  15,000-square-foot grocery store and a new post office, providing a place for  residents to shop and check their mail away from the onslaught of visitors on  tourist-crammed Crescent Avenue. Nearby would be a "transportation hub," where  tourists would validate cross-channel transportation tickets, check in baggage  and purchase tickets for tours into the interior. Such arrangements are now  done at various locations, including Cabrillo Mole on Pebbly Beach Road and the  Island Plaza on Sumner Avenue.  </P> <P> * Reducing traffic by relocating many service-oriented businesses away from  tourist areas.  </P> <P> * Sprucing up the city's parks, possibly adding landscaping along Sumner and  Metropole avenues, based on the same architectural theme as the pedestrian mall  on Crescent Avenue.  </P> <P> Island company officials said it is difficult to estimate how much the new  developments could bring the city in revenue from hotel and business taxes, but  one official ventured a rough estimate of about $1.7 million annually. Avalon's  current annual budget is about $8 million.  </P> <P> Some aspects of the plan have been in the works for at least 20 years, said  lifelong Avalon resident Malcolm Renton, a retired vice president of the island  company.  </P> <P> For example, building a grand hotel at Descanso Beach has been the company's  goal since the St. Catherine Hotel, an elegant structure where Clark Gable,  Mary Pickford, Cecil B. De Mille and other Hollywood stars once stayed, was  razed in 1966.  </P> <P> "The plan was always to keep that a choice hotel location," said Renton, 81,  whose father also worked for the island company.  </P> <P> In June, the island company presented conceptual plans to residents at a town  meeting, and reaction was mostly favorable.  </P> <P> Of 67 residents who responded to an island company survey after the  presentation, 25 residents, or about 41%, unconditionally approved the overall  concept. Only two residents didn't like the plan. More meetings are planned  over the coming year.  </P> <P> In interviews, residents seem confident that the plan will succeed.  </P> <P> "It's a beautiful set-up," said Lolo Saldana, owner of Lolo's Plaza Barber Shop  on Sumner Avenue.  </P> <P> "I'm absolutely impressed with it," said Lita Mulvihill, an Avalon resident for  17 years, who said the plan "is renovating and restoring and bringing things  back to life that used to be, like the old St. Catherine."  </P> <P> Wayne Griffin, executive director of the Catalina Chamber of Commerce, said the  chamber is unlikely to take a formal position on the island company plans. But  Griffin said he approves of the plans and the island company's solicitation of  response from the town.  </P> <P> "I thought it was great," Griffin said. "They're being very up-front about what  they're doing and asking people what they think. It's refreshing."  </P> <P> Patricia Moore, director and curator of the Catalina Island Museum, said the  timing couldn't be better.  </P> <P> "I think our town needs to take a good hard look at ourselves because we're  outgrowing ourselves," she said. "I think we're due for an uplift."  </P></p>

The same sources add that the forces of the [pro-Abdic]  autonomous province of western Bosnia [APZB], using all  available means, have taken the village of Trzac [northwest of  Cazin] and inflicted great losses on the army loyal to the  Sarajevo authorities.    Izetbegovic's forces, using infantry and artillery weapons,  are trying to break through the demarcation lines and infiltrate  inside the APZB, but are not succeeding.

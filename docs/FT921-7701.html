			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / World Trade News: Balfour Beatty leads study to build Malaysian airport AN Anglo-Japanese consortium led by Balfour Beatty, construction arm of the BICC Group, has won the contract to draw up the masterplan study to build a Pounds 2bn airport at Sepang, Malaysia, Paul Betts reports. The consortium also includes GEC Marconi, Trafalgar House Construction and Marubeni Corporation of Japan. It is expected to complete the study in about nine months. Winning the Pounds 2m contract has made the consortium strongly placed to secure the order to build and develop the airport project. BAA, the UK airport operator, has also been appointed lead consultant for the study. The Malaysian government aims to open the new airport, about 50km south of Kuala Lumpur, in 1997. BICC said yesterday the detailed engineering and first-stage construction would include two runways, terminals, associated infrastructure and a high-speed train link. The project is expected to be financed by a mix of private and public funds. The masterplan project team will develop proposals for further links to Kuala Lumpur. The airport project reflects the need to improve and expand airport infrastructure facilities in the Asian region, which continues to offer best potential growth in international passenger air traffic. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) expects north-east Asia to show average annual growth in international passenger numbers of 9.7 per cent, and south-east Asia of 9.2 per cent between now and 1995. GEC Alsthom, the Anglo-French power generating equipment supplier, has won a Pounds 95m contract to build a power plant in Pakistan. The plant, involving conversion of an existing power station at Multan, north-east Pakistan, will have total capacity of 600MW, and is due to be commissioned in 1994.</p>

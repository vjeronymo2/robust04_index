			<p>BFN     [Text] A thin blue line and a thicker khaki line are what  make orderly political transition a more likely scenario in  South Africa than chaotic uhuru [freedom].    Zimbabwe is a better analogy than Angola or Mozambique. In  Angola and Mozambique the Portuguese troops -- and the police  structures -- withdrew almost overnight (as in the earlier  Belgian Congo), leaving a power vacuum. Looting and disorder  took over, then civil war. Portuguese civilians fled with what  they could carry.    In Zimbabwe, Ian Smith's police and army stayed in place.  The transition was orderly and the army later integrated with  guerilla forces. Some of the white civilian population chose to  stay on, many today enjoying a lifestyle barely distinguishable  from before.    South Africa is in the grip of social and political upheaval  far beyond what happened in Zimbabwe, in spite of the scale and  ferocity of the bush war. But South Africa also has in place a  large and efficient police force and, to back it up, the most  effective military machine south of the Sahara.    Citizen Force and Commando reserves have been called up for  later this month to keep the lid on disorder. More can be  called up if necessary. They will be used to patrol and protect  city centres and suburbs as well as the township flashpoints.  The military back-up has been severely stretched by commitments  in Bophuthatwana, Lebowa Ciskei and kwaZulu/Natal, as well as on  the East Rand, but the authorities are nevertheless determined  to keep a firm grip.    The police have put together a comprehensive plan for the  period leading up to elections, the days of polling and the  post-election phase. Measures include "maximum visibility in  all areas by means of intensive patrols in all residential areas  and on routes to polling stations". Spotting will be done from  the air and fixed observation posts, while there will be maximum  use of video cameras. "By the day of the election our forces  will be at a peak," says Major-General Opperman, a former  infantry commander who is now director of communications at  Defence Headquarters. "We will be in a position to contain any  situation that might arise." He says the frequency of incidents  needing security force attention is expected to pick up as the  election date approaches.    The troops will stay in place after the election, to help  the  police. If conditions warrant, the call-up could be extended.  "We will still be in place in the post-election phase, to  provide the security we regard as essential for transition to a  new dispensation and democracy."    Gen Opperman emphasises that, in consultation with the  police, military units will patrol urban and suburban areas as  needed, as well as rural areas and townships. No part of the  country will lack a security force presence. "I suggest  communities who feel anxious about their security should get in  touch with their regional police commands so that adequate  arrangements can be made. Our operation will be very much  hearth and home-protection of the ordinary civilian". He is  bemused by speculation that the military call-up later this  month will be poorly answered. "We have no evidence at all to  suggest this. The call-up hasn't happened yet, so how do people  make these claims? We have every confidence the call-up will be  answered, as it always was before. It doesn't make sense for  people to refuse when it's law and order and their own security  that is at stake."    After the elections the SADF [South African Defence Force]  will continue to be a stabilising force, says Gen Opperman."  "We are not a colonial power about to return home. We will  integrate with other forces over a period but we won't lose our  efficiency. We will be an effective fighting force. Internally  we act as a back-up to the police but, in the end, the SADF is  the only force with the numbers and resources to stand firm  against chaos and anarchy.</p>

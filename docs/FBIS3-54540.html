Even the souls of Hitler  and Mussolini are feeling ashamed of the manner in which the  Indian security forces have been carrying out the heinous and  appalling crimes in the savage massacres of the Kashmiris  including children, burning their homes, and gang-raping women  on the pretext of their being connected with the Hizbul  Mojahedin and the Movement for the Freedom of Kashmir  organizations. India has done as much as it could to cover up  these brutalities by carrying out anti-Pakistan propaganda, but  Western countries and the international human rights  organizations have now become fully aware of the actual  situation and have been voicing strong protests against the  gross violation of human rights in occupied Kashmir. Lately,  besides Asia Watch and Amnesty International, several members of  the British Parliament and prominent Indian parliamentarian  Indrajit Gupta have also joined these protests; and the Indian  Government, after getting tired of this situation, has flatly  refused to allow a delegation of the Amnesty International to  visit occupied Kashmir.    Under these circumstances, the advice from India's old ally  -- a staunch supporter of New Delhi on the Kashmir issue in the  past -- to find a just solution to the Kashmir dispute reflects  the increasing awareness and concern in the entire world for an  early resolution of this issue. India will not be able to  counter these pressures for long and will, therefore, be forced  to settle the problem in accordance with the wishes of the  Kashmiri people and the relevant resolutions of the United  Nations. Considering this situation as a good augury, Pakistan  will have to further intensify its struggle to fully apprise the  international public opinion of its stand on Kashmir.</p>

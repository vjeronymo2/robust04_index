			<p><P> July 20, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> In a version of dueling game-show hosts, former "Hollywood Squares" host Peter  Marshall filed a $1-million-plus suit in Los Angeles County Superior Court  Wednesday against Burt &amp; Bert Productions, a company belonging to actor  Burt Reynolds and game-show host Bert Convy. In the suit, Marshall claims he  was bumped as host of the coming "3rd Degree" game show and replaced by Convy,  who was not renewed as the host of the syndicated version of "Win, Lose or  Draw." Marshall hosted the pilot for "3rd Degree" -- produced by Burt &amp;  Bert Productions and Kline &amp; Friends, also named in the suit -- and says  announcements were made that he would host the show for the fall season. "We  never made a formal announcement that he would be on the show," executive  producer Richard Kline said Wednesday in response to the suit. "We never even  picked up the option to his contract." Kline said Convy was chosen when he  became available because he reflects the young demographics "3rd Degree" is  after. Marshall, whose suit alleges fraud and breach of contract, seeks  compensatory and punitive damages. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / Sealink intensifies Channel price war The cross-Channel ferry price war intensified yesterday as Stena Sealink, one of the two main operators on short sea routes across the Channel, announced 20 per cent price cuts in services to France. The move was in response to the decision last month by P&amp;O European Ferries to offer a 10 per cent reduction on its Dover to Calais services. Eurotunnel dismissed the price war as 'a matter between the ferries', but the price cuts represent an increased threat to the viability of the Channel tunnel.</p>

			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / International Company News: Hoyts plans to spin off its cinema operations Hoyts Group, the Australia-based cinema and radio-station operator, plans to raise up to ADollars 400m (USDollars 296m) by spinning off its cinema operations in Australia, New Zealand and the US, AP-DJ reports from Sydney. Hoyts operates 112 cinemas with a total of 707 screens in the three countries. It has been controlled by the Fink family since 1985. Shares in the new company - to be called Hoyts Cinemas - will be sold through an initial public offering to investors in Australia and elsewhere. However, Hoyts Cinemas will only be listed on the Australian Stock Exchange. The company expects the offering to be completed before the end of this year 'if all runs smoothly'. The Fink family will buy a 'small minority' stake in Hoyts Cinemas through the IPO. In the US, Hoyts operates 79 cinemas, most of them in the suburbs of several north-eastern cities. It plans to expand in this region by adding 158 screens over five years. The company said there were also also significant opportunities in Mexico. Hoyts Cinemas plans to add a further 100 screens to its Australian operations as part of its expansion strategy. The Fink family formerly controlled a large radio, cinema and advertising group with two listed companies, Hoyts Media and Hoyts Entertainment. However, a growing debt burden, shrinking revenues and a sharp fall in the value of its radio licenses during the late 1980s forced the family to restructure its operations, selling its radio stations to the listed Village Roadshow. The outdoor and cinema advertising activities, under Hoyts Entertainment, were restructured and renamed Television &amp; Media Services. They continue to trade on the Australian Stock Exchange. The Fink family wants to use the majority of funds raised through the planned IPO of Hoyts Cinemas to repay bank debt.</p>

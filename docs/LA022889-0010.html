			<p><P> February 28, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DRUG SMUGGLERS  </P> <P> If this country truly is seeking a lasting solution to its currently  uncontrollable drug problem, it would behoove our "powers that be" to adopt the  method used by Iran ("Iran Hangs 70 for Drug Smuggling," Part I, Feb. 15).  There certainly are no repeat offenders; future prospects would surely think  twice, lest they be caught; and quite possibly our youth would lean more  positively towards education and not street gangs, if the pushers couldn't lure  them into selling.  </P> <P> Yes, the penalty is severe. Maybe it's time to review our "protective" laws and  get tough in action, not just dialogue.  </P> <P> ESTER HOPE STEELE  </P> <P> Mission Hills  </P></p>

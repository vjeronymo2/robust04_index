			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Jose Fernando Hoyos] </F>   [Text] During the 10 years that AIDS has existed in  Colombia it has officially caused the deaths of 1,800 persons.  However, based on data from the National Survey of Knowledge,  Attitudes, and Behaviors Related to Sexually Transmitted  Diseases - HIV/AIDS Infection, there could be over 121,000 HIV  carriers in Colombia.    This investigation, the most extensive now available, was  ordered by the Deputy Directorate of Health Services of the ISS  [expansion not given] from Profamilia, and was based on  interviews with 18,000 people.    According to the report, "20.3 percent of the tests of men  and 1.3 percent of the tests of women were positive. This means  that, of the total population, 118,093 men and 3,538 women could  be HIV-positive or what amounts to the same thing, 35 of each  10,000 inhabitants might be infected with the HIV virus.    Minister of Health Juan Luis Londono de la Cuesta said this  was a very high figure. According to the ministry's projections,  there might be 50,000 HIV carriers in Colombia.    As in other parts of the world, the official figures in  Colombia are not very realistic, because of the enormous  underreporting of AIDS.    Although the figure is disturbing in itself, what is even  worse is the Colombian population's profound ignorance about  this disease.    All the work done since June 1983, when the first case of  AIDS in Colombia was found in Cartagena, has apparently not  accomplished very much.    According to this survey, 89 percent of the people  interviewed said they knew what AIDS is, but when questioned in  greater depth, it became apparent that the Colombian people know  very little.    For example, 54.5 percent did not have the slightest idea  that AIDS was a fatal disease, and barely half knew that it is  transmitted sexually. Only 2.7 percent knew that it can be  transmitted through blood, and 1.8 percent that it can be  transmitted perinatally (from the mother to the fetus).    A significant percentage, 16 percent of the population,  continues to believe that it afflicts homosexuals, prostitutes,  bisexuals, and drug addicts; 5 percent said that it is a plague  or a disease like cancer; 1.3 percent believe it is a new  disease imported into Colombia; and 1 percent think it is caused  by immorality.    While 73 percent know there is still no cure for AIDS, 9.5  percent think there is a cure, and 18 percent do not know.    Once again it was clear that in the area of sex education  the  youngest people and those with the highest educational levels  are the best informed.  <H5>  I Am Immortal, I Am Not At Risk </H5>   According to this investigation, 72 percent of the Colombian  people do not think they are at risk for AIDS; 21 percent think  they are at risk, and 7 percent do not know. Of people who have  been sexually active, 23 percent of the men and 25 percent of  the women think they have a high risk of contracting AIDS.    Among persons who believe they are at risk, 4.6 percent of  the men think it is because their partner was unfaithful; 3.6  percent because of their sexual practices; 7 percent because  they have had casual sex with anybody; 1.4 percent because they  needed a blood transfusion or blood products; and a small part  because they have shared syringes, are at risk because of their  job, or because they are in contact with items belonging to  persons who are infected.    Among the 20 percent of the women, 12 percent think they may  be at risk because their partner was unfaithful; 0.4 percent  because of their sexual practices; 0.4 percent because they have  had casual sexual relations with anybody; and the rest because  of blood transfusions, sharing syringes, because of their job,  or from contact with items belonging to infected persons.    "In urban areas there is believed to be a greater AIDS risk  than in rural areas. In Antioquia and central Colombia, people  think they have a higher risk, while in the east they believe  they have a reduced risk," stated the investigation report.    The people who believe they cannot be infected attribute  this  to being monogamous (42 percent); not having sexual relations  (14 percent); and not engaging in high-risk practices (10  percent).    "People who are not now in a stable relationship, young  people who have not completed primary or secondary school,  people in Antioquia, the central region, the Valle, Tolima,  Huila, and Santander regions say they have engaged in high-risk  behaviors."  <H5>  Fidelity, the Best Method </H5>   Over half the population (53 percent) thinks that AIDS can  be  avoided by fidelity to a single partner, always using a condom  (34 percent); not having casual relations (26 percent); not  sharing syringes (13 percent), and requiring blood tests (11  percent). For 5 percent of the population, the best  AIDS-prevention method is use of a method that never fails,  abstinence.    A little over half the women believe fidelity is the best  way  to prevent disease; 28 percent believe in using a condom; and 24  percent in not having casual sexual relations. Surprisingly, 17  percent think AIDS can be prevented by avoiding contact with  infected persons.    People under 45, those now in a stable relationship, and  people with a higher level of education know the importance of  fidelity, while younger people and those who are single or  separated are aware of the need to use a condom.    On the contrary, older and less well-educated people are the  most fearful about contact with persons infected with the AIDS  virus.  <H5>  AIDS </H5>  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Percentage Who Say They Know What AIDS Is                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Men                      |Women                    |Total                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |89.0                     |89.0                     |89.0                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Percentage Who Know It Is Fatal                                              |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Men                      |Women                    |Total                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |47.8                     |43.5                     |45.6                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Percentage Who Know It is Transmitted Sexually                               |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Men                      |Women                    |Total                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |50.2                     |54.5                     |52.7                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Percentage Using a Condom                                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Men                      |Women                    |Total                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |5.0                      |3.9                      |3.0                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Percentage Who Know It Is Transmitted by Blood                               |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Men                      |Women                    |Total                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |2.4                      |3.0                      |2.7                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------    <H5>  With or Without a Condom </H5>   The results of the National Survey of Knowledge, Attitudes,  and Behaviors Related to STD's-HIV/AIDS Infection, found some  very interesting points concerning the sexual behavior of  Colombians.    While 95.6 percent of the Colombian people know about  condoms, only 5 percent of the population uses condoms.    This contrasts with 34 percent of the people who mention  using condoms as a method of preventing AIDS; it seems that when  having sexual relations, they prefer a natural approach.    One reason for this last-minute change may be that 35  percent  of sexual relations take place under the influence of alcohol.    It is surprising that the 84 percent of the women whose  partners have used a condom at some time have used it as a  contraceptive rather than as protection from disease.    One factor that will be used in AIDS and STD prevention  campaigns is that 92 percent of the adults in Colombia have had  sexual relations (97 percent of the men and 88 percent of the  women). The strange thing is that 91 percent of single men and  51 percent of single women have had sexual relations.    Of people who have had casual sexual relations, 41 percent  of  the men and 49 percent of the women did not obtain information  about their partner's sexual history.</p>

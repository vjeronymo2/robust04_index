			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / New mural now adorns Iraq's baby milk factory A HUGE new mural adorns Iraq's baby milk factory, which became one of its most potent symbols from the Gulf war. The factory, which went into production this week, was flattened by the western allies, who claimed it was a secret chemical weapons plant. However, its reopening will provide little more than a symbolic dent in Iraq's need for baby milk. The issue of what use the factory was put to before the war has never been fully resolved. Iraq has consistently denied it mixed or stored chemicals there.</p>

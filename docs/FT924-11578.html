			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / London hospitals begin fight against closure SEVERAL of London's most famous hospitals yesterday began fighting for their own lives as the government published plans for radical changes in the capital's healthcare. Under the proposals, St Bartholomew's, a world-famous, 869-year-old institution in the City, would close in an amalgamation with the Royal London. The Middlesex would close and Guy's and St Thomas' would be amalgamated. Charing Cross would close, although its buildings could be used to house specialist services. Ministers will make final decisions on the recommendations, in a report from Sir Bernard Tomlinson, former chairman of the Northern Regional Health Authority, in the new year. Although publication of the report provoked angry opposition from staff at the threatened institutions, there is widespread recognition that the number of hospital beds in London will be reduced. Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, welcomed the report's broad conclusions that hospital services in London needed to be rationalised, with a strengthening of family doctor and community services. But her refusal to guarantee that any savings resulting from hospital closures would be channelled into improving primary and community care in London angered Labour MPs when she announced publication of the report in the Commons. Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, feared that the government would use the report as an excuse to cut NHS spending. While accepting that the 'status quo is not an option', Mr Blunkett said inadequate health care for the people of London could not be an option either. He coupled demands for increased spending on primary and community care with a pledge that Labour MPs would seek to protect jobs of health workers. Mr Blunkett was joined by other Labour MPs in demanding that receipts from the sale of valuable hospital sites should not be used to assist Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, in holding down public expenditure. In the long term, it is thought that transferring services from hospitals to the community sector would have a neutral financial effect. But some health analysts are concerned that Sir Bernard's calculation of the additional transitional costs involved - about Pounds 150m - is substantially lower than other estimates.

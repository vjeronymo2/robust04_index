			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Arts: 'Coriolanus' from Quebec While Coriolanus has always seemed to me one of the most English of Shakespeare's plays - about a public school boy with a dominating mother - it has a quite different tradition abroad. According to the Arden edition of the play, 15 versions of a piece called Coriolan were written in France between 1625 and 1821. There are at least 13 operas with the same name, though none is based on Shakespeare. The Germans stuck more closely to the original and have produced about a dozen adaptations, including an unfinished piece by Bertolt Brecht. Some productions have ended in tears. In Paris in the mid-1930s a performance at the Comedie Francaise led to such riots in the streets that the prime minister, Daladier, dismissed the director and replaced him with the chief of security. In West Germany after the war Coriolanus was banned altogether. The first postwar production did not take place until 1953. So it comes as an anti-climax to report that there have been no riots in Nottingham where the Quebec version of Coriolan is appearing as part of the 30th anniversary of the Playhouse. It has been carefully chosen, for it was with a Tyrone Guthrie production of Coriolanus that the present Playhouse opened in December 1963. In the cast then were Michael Crawford, Leo McKern, John Neville and Ian McKellen. Robert Lepage's production for his Theatre Repere company is a distinctive successor and a considerable coup for Nottingham. This is the only place where Coriolan is being staged in Britain and it runs only this week. Lepage is the director who gave us A Midsummer Night's Dream bogged down in a swamp at the Royal National Theatre. There are no such excesses here, but there are innovations. Although there is very little direct use of film, the play is produced as a movie, using cinematic techniques throughout. The stage is dominated by a large rectangular frame. The characters appear behind it, as if it were a transparent screen. Quite often their heads are cut off from sight; at other times there are close-ups. Television is used as well. News of the wars is reported live. Jacques Languirand's outstanding Menenius appears as a genial old uniformed general giving his views on a television talks programme. The tribunes face up to Coriolan on an equivalent of Question Time. There are copious surtitles and the production is quite close to the original Shakespeare text. As a spectacle, I enjoyed it enormously, largely because it is so well done. The last thing one would like to see would be British companies going off in the Lepage direction and doing the same thing badly. Lepage is a master of his techniques. A final point is that Coriolanus really does seem a different play to non-British. Lepage's production is much more about political instability than a relationship between mother and son. Coleridge said that Coriolanus demonstrates the 'wonderful philosophic impartiality of Shakespeare's politics'. But perhaps you have to live in a quiet country to see the play in that way. Meanwhile, for those in London, there is another production of Coriolanus by the Aquila company at the Place Theatre, Bloomsbury, ending on Saturday. This version catches all the excitement, but still seems to me more about people than politics. Whereas in Coriolan Anne-Marie Cadieux's Volumnia has a touch of expensive continental chic, here Katharine Barker in the same role seems much more a matron. This is the Coriolanus we know.</p>

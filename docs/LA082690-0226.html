			<p><P> August 26, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DROPPING ANCHOR  </P> <P> Re the Aug. 5 cover story "Anchored in L.A.": Obviously, KNBC's John Beard,  Linda Alvarez, Kelly Lange and Keith Morrison haven't the foggiest idea,  judging by their performances.  </P> <P> John Beard is in dire need of speech therapy.  </P> <P> He cannot pronounce words properly. The words million, billion and trillion  come out as miw-yun, biw-yun and triw-yun.  </P> <P> Linda Alvarez has a grin constantly affixed to her face, even when reporting  terrible tragedies.  </P> <P> Kelly Lange, after nearly 20 years of punctuating her reports with phrases like  "Hey, all right!" never seems to know which camera to look at.  </P> <P> Keith Morrison reports the news in a style which is, at best, irritating-at  worst, very weird. His voice changes pitch so often during the newscast that  one is reminded of Tiny Tim's rendition of "Tiptoe Through the Tulips." These  four goofy, grinning stooges make the Channel 4 news a real hoot.  </P> <P> Scott Phillips, Norwalk  </P></p>

			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Technology: Sugar cubes to virtual blood - A three-dimensional simulator could soon be used to train British surgeons The technique of inserting a tiny camera and surgical instruments down tubes into the human abdominal cavity - keyhole or laparoscopic surgery - revolutionised operations in the mid-1980s when it was first used in the US. Since then, the technique, which in most cases reduces scarring and cuts post-operative recovery time, has swept through Europe. Today, some 75 per cent of gall-bladder operations in the UK use laparoscopic techniques. But this technology has required surgeons to develop new skills. They have to perform a three-dimensional operation while watching a two-dimensional television screen. Also, because the instruments pivot on the abdominal wall, when the surgeon moves his hand to the right the instrument inside the body moves to the left. In some European countries, surgeons can practise these techniques on anaesthetised animals. But in the UK, Home Office regulations prevent the use of livestock. In the early days of laparoscopic surgery, British surgeons travelled abroad to develop their skills. But to train in the UK, in most cases, they have had to use laparoscopic trainers (surgical instruments inserted into boxes) and practise on foodstuffs - for instance, by stacking sugar cubes and stitching chicken legs. But this could change under a joint initiative from the Department of Health and the Wolfson Foundation to establish research centres in England and Scotland. One will be based at Manchester Royal Infirmary; part of its role will be to develop a virtual reality simulator to help train surgeons in laparoscopic techniques. The centre is part of a broader, nationwide initiative by the foundation and the department. 'We plan to collaborate closely with industry because there have been a number of developments in this field. Eventually, we hope to come up with our own practical simulator into which we can put several three-dimensional operations,' explains Rory McCloy, a consultant surgeon at Manchester Royal Infirmary and clinical director of the project. To gauge the suitability of technology in this field, the Manchester centre has linked up with Advanced Robotics Research, a small company at Salford University. Together they plan to develop a 3-D anatomical simulator which will enable junior surgeons to practise minimally invasive surgery in a virtual world. Advanced Robotics, which also runs a number of virtual reality research programmes in the engineering sector, will work with McCloy. During the three-year project, Advanced Robotics plans to draw on both its own and outside expertise, says Robert Stone, the company's technical manager and virtual reality director for the simulator project. Stone says part of his job will be to form an advisory group. The aim is to bring together 'what have until recently been quite diverse and unfocused technologies into a single centre to develop cost-effective virtual trainers'. He says the US is much more involved than the UK in virtual reality and medicine. He has invited James Coleman, a surgeon and European medical director for Davis &amp; Geck, the surgical division of Cyanamid, the US drugs company, to join the advisory committee. Stone is also in touch with Marconi Simulation, part of GEC, and the engineering department at Cambridge University. Coleman, based at Cyanamid's London research centre, is also a consultant to Cine-Med, a US company which makes medical education films. Cine-Med has developed an advanced prototype simulator called Virtual Clinic. It comprises a graphics workstation which houses a 'reality engine', software and a simulator comprising six-dimensional tracking devices, surgical instruments and a patient shell. On a screen, surgeons can see virtual organs reacting to stimuli as they would in the real world. If an organ is cut, virtual blood flows from the wound and if dissected it becomes two separate objects. Cine-Med plans to release the Virtual Clinic on to the world market next year, says Coleman, and the company hopes to set up a European research centre, possibly in the UK or Germany. The joint research project between Manchester Royal Infirmary and Advanced Robotics is not about simply adopting a system, says Stone, but using all the resources it can to develop a virtual simulator which best suits the needs of UK surgeons. Coleman agrees that co-ordinated research will benefit the industry as a whole. Advanced Robotics, for example, plans to develop special gloves which give the surgeon the feeling of touch and 'force feedback'. 'When you wear one of these gloves and hold, move or cut a virtual organ, the surgeon will be able to feel it,' says McCloy. Stone describes the glove as an 'exoskeleton (skin) in reverse'. It applies force with a series of pressure pads to the hand inside it, and by linking the exoskeleton's motors to the virtual graphics a surgeon can 'feel' forces as virtual tissue is pulled. Another of the team's goals is to send virtual imagery down telephone lines, a move which one day may enable junior surgeons at different hospitals to practise operations on simulators linked to desktop computers. 'Virtual reality has been dismissed as arcade game surgery by some surgeons, but its importance is limited only by our imagination,' says McCloy. 'It's no substitute for operating on real people - but l think it could fill a very important gap between operating on sugar cubes and doing the real thing.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Message from Interior Minister Yu Hokkri -- recorded] </F>   [Text] My respects to the two supreme patriarchs, all  venerable monks, and my beloved compatriots:    I, Yu Hokkri, minister of the interior, would like to  present  the following announcement from the Interior Ministry:    In compliance with the message dated 15 May of His Majesty  Norodom Sihanouk Varaman, revered king of the Kingdom of  Cambodia, in which he appealed to all brothers, sisters,  children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren to not hold the  demonstration on 16 and 17 May so as to avoid any incidents  which might bring about adverse consequences that will further  complicate the solution that we are seeking for our motherland  through peaceful means in line with Lord Buddha's teachings,  Venerable Monk (Vichea Ratanapannha Wilson) and (Sit Kosangsin),  representatives of the Kampuchea Kraom Buddhist Association, and  the Cambodian Youth Association have decided to cancel their  planned demonstration.    At the same time, a group of people have distributed false  letters calling on the public to join demonstrations or meetings  on 17 May in the name of the two associations mentioned above.    Venerable Monk (Vichea Ratanapannha Wilson) and (Sit  Kosangsin) have rejected any undertaking that run counter to the  wish and desire of the revered his majesty the king, who is the  father of national peace.    The Interior Ministry would like to stress also that until  now, the ministry has not received any new requests for holding  the demonstration.    It is with the goal of ensuring security and public order  that I would like your venerable personages and the public to  please be informed.    Thank you.    Issued in Phnom Penh on 16 May 1994</p>

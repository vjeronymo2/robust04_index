			<p><P> December 1, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> VANDALS HIT KING FREEWAY SIGN  </P> <P> One of four signs erected last month renaming a 10-mile stretch of California  94 as the Martin Luther King Jr. Freeway was reported defaced Thursday morning  with the letters KKK, according to the California Department of Transportation.  </P> <P> A Caltrans crew went out shortly after the sign, on westbound 94 near the Lemon  Grove Avenue exit in La Mesa, was vandalized with spray paint, said Jeff  Morgan, a Caltrans supervisor.  </P> <P> "Because it's an important sign, we try to remove the graffiti as quickly as  possible," he said. "If it becomes a repetitive problem, we may find a higher  elevation to move the signs."  </P> <P> The four green-and-white signs, paid for largely by private donations, were  unveiled Nov. 20. The segment of the state route christened in honor of the  slain civil-rights leader begins in downtown San Diego and ends at the  interchange with California 125 in La Mesa.  </P></p>

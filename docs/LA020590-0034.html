			<p><P> February 5, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SERVICES HOARD $30 BILLION IN SURPLUS ITEMS  </P> <P> America's armed services have $30 billion worth of unneeded military supplies  and hardware gathering dust in warehouses across the country or rusting away  outside, according to a report released Sunday by the Senate Budget Committee.  </P> <P> Despite those stockpiles, the Pentagon had $20 billion worth of new orders in  the pipeline and another $30 billion waiting to be spent on supplies and  equipment, according to the committee study, carried out in the closing months  of 1989.  </P> <P> The findings, gleaned from previous reports by the General Accounting Office  and military auditors, interviews with Defense Department officials and  inspections by staff aides for Budget Committee Democrats, were sent to Defense  Secretary Dick Cheney on Friday.  </P> <P> Cheney is scheduled to appear before the panel today to discuss the Bush  Administration's proposed $295-billion defense budget for 1991. Committee  Chairman Jim Sasser (D-Tenn.) said he intends to use the report to raise  questions about potential budget cuts.  </P> <P> In conversations with officials as recently as last week, Sasser said,  committee investigators were told that the Army alone has 12,000 categories of  items in oversupply.  </P> <P> "What we have," Sasser said in an interview Sunday, "is a disinclination to  ever terminate contracts. Once they are signed, they go on and on. There are no  incentives among purchasing people to save money."  </P> <P> During the last five years, the report said, the Pentagon has spent about $700  million to refurbish and expand its warehouse space.  </P> <P> But the committee staff found that military warehouses and depots across the  country were "glutted" and that expensive hardware sometimes was stored in the  open, deteriorating from exposure to the elements.  </P> <P> For example, parts for Apache helicopters were found stored outside because of  a lack of available warehouse space and had to be extensively overhauled before  use, investigators reported. In some cases, the parts were unsalvageable.  </P> <P> They reported that in Oakland, ship propellers have been stored on docks  because there is no space to store them inside.  </P> <P> With the Administration planning to bring home thousands of American troops  from Europe and congressional Democrats pushing for even greater troop  reductions, Sasser said the surplus supply problems are apt to be compounded.  </P> <P> In a letter to Cheney, Sasser called on the Pentagon to halt the purchase of  items already on hand and to develop plans for disposal of unneeded items. He  also asked for another review of the military's requirements for additional  warehouse construction.  </P> <P> Altogether, the armed forces' inventory of stored supplies and equipment  amounts to more than $100 billion, of which an estimated $30 billion is  unneeded, the report said.  </P> <P> Between 1983 and 1988, during the Ronald Reagan Administration's military  buildup, the inventory soared to $103 billion from $61 billion, the committee  staff found.  </P> <P> "The largest rate of growth . . . has been in 'inapplicable inventory' items  (that) the Pentagon says it doesn't need and may never need," the report said.  </P> <P> In the most extreme case cited in the report, investigators said they turned up  what amounted to a 13,157-year supply of a machine tool used to make circuits  for the Navy's F-14 Tomcat fighter plane. According to the report, only four of  the tools are used each year, but the Navy has 52,628 of them in stock.  </P> <P> The Army was found to have purchased 126 different sizes of shirts for female  soldiers, many of which are never expected to be worn.  </P> <P> The oversupply and the stocking of items of dubious use was blamed on poor  management and inventory control practices. In some cases, those practices made  it difficult to determine what was already in warehouses.  </P> <P> Investigators said that military agencies continued to buy items after they  already had been identified as unneeded. The report cited a GAO finding last  year that the Pentagon had on hand a more-than-50-year supply of 1,241 items,  and a 25-to-50-year supply of another 852 items. The two categories together  represented a value of more than $100 million.  </P> <P> The warehouse crunch has led to even more mistakes in acquisition, according to  the report.  </P> <P> The committee staff cited one unidentified Army item, which was found to have  been stored at 27 locations in California. In another case last year, the Army  reported 80,000 jungle camouflage helmet covers as lost, purchased more, then  found the missing 80,000.  </P> <P> Some armed forces supply and warehousing operations are still using  "old-fashioned pencil and paper" inventory control and management practices,  Sasser said.  </P></p>

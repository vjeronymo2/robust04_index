			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Panel stops publication of Greene King results GREENE KING, the East Anglia-based brewer which is engaged in a hostile Pounds 102.6m bid for Morland, the Thames Valley brewer, has been prevented by the Takeover Panel from publishing its results for the year to May 3 1992. The Panel decided that publication of the results, due to take place today, could have affected the outcome of the bid. Greene King, after buying a further 100,000 Morland shares, has 47 per cent of Morland. The offer closes on Friday, although it can be extended until July 27. Over the past few weeks Greene King has been challenged by Morland to issue a profit forecast for the year. Greene King's stockbrokers have forecast that full year pre-tax profits would slip from Pounds 19.1m to Pounds 18.8m or Pounds 18.5m. Greene King was also planning to announce the revaluation of its assets which it does every five years. The last revaluation was in 1987. Greene King is offering 4.5 convertible shares - which yesterday amounted to 484p - for each Morland share. There is a cash alternative of 450p. Both companies were constrained by the Panel in what they could say publicly about the decision. However, Mr Simon Redman, chairman of Greene King, said he was extremely disappointed by the Panel's decision. He added that current trading conditions remained 'most satisfactory' and that the board still intended to rec-ommend a final dividend of 8.1p. Greene King believed its results would have bolstered its position, while Morland believed the opposite. As Greene King's results will not be published until after the end of the offer period Morland's shareholders will not know who was right until after they have decided whether or not to accept Greene King's offer.</p>

			<p><P> August 10, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRISIS IN THE PERSIAN GULF;  </P> <P> WHITE-KNUCKLE DAYS IN THE LIFE OF OIL FUTURES TRADERS  </P> <P> Trading a futures market is a matter of carefully interpreting ambiguous signs,  and the signs seemed plenty obscure Thursday as they flashed on the screens of  Dean Witter Reynolds' New York energy futures desk.  </P> <P> Iran warns that it won't tolerate Kuwait's annexation, read one headline.  Turkey has moved F-16 fighter planes to its frontier, said another.  </P> <P> "Intermittent movement of Iraqis toward Saudi border," broker Randall  Rothenberg recited from a screen as he tried to simultaneously hold three  telephone receivers. "What's that mean?"  </P> <P> "They're doing the tango?" proposed broker Stephanie Rzasa.  </P> <P> Such headlines have taken on unusual significance in the past week, since  Iraq's invasion of Kuwait sent oil prices into orbit and focused the world's  attention on the gyrating oil futures market of New York. Indeed, the market  centered at the New York Mercantile Exchange is the world hub of oil futures  trading. It has been where America has looked to discover that crude oil prices  had leaped as much as one-third.  </P> <P> Volume on the exchange has set records twice in the past five days and, though  Thursday was quieter, some traders believe that the market may churn and heave  again if the unpredictable Iraqi president, Saddam Hussein, decides to resist  growing military pressure around him. Historically, oil futures have been twice  as volatile as financial futures such as bonds and stock-index futures and, in  the past week, they've demonstrated that volatility again.  </P> <P> All of this makes the game of betting on prices more interesting than usual for  traders and brokers, such as Rothenberg, who work at New York's more than  two-dozen energy futures desks. "As prices get up into the stratosphere, you've  really got little to go on," said Rothenberg, who is 34.  </P> <P> The seven-broker Dean Witter desk is in Manhattan's twin-towered World Trade  Center -- only two buildings away from the chaotic Nymex trading pits where  floor brokers and traders swap contracts, which are pledges to buy and sell  specified amounts of oil at a designated date. Brokers such as Rothenberg take  orders from such customers as oil companies, banks, petroleum wholesalers, oil  producers and even airlines, and call them to floor brokers for execution of  the trades.  </P> <P> The trading desk is dense with phones, computer hardware and screens flashing  fast-changing prices and news dispatches. On the walls are large maps showing  the location of refineries and oil and gas lines in the United States and the  Persian Gulf.  </P> <P> While the brokers aren't betting the firm's own money by buying contracts,  customers are relying on them for their judgment on the market's direction.  </P> <P> At the regular staff meeting that preceded the market's 9:45 a.m. opening, the  Dean Witter group decided that the recent decline in prices might soon be  reversed. Through the morning, the brokers got that word out to customers.  </P> <P> With tanks, aircraft and a flotilla of ships moving toward him, Hussein "is  going to be like a caged tiger," Rothenberg told one. "He's not going to turn  on his heel and go quietly home. . . . He may be getting his claws ready."  </P> <P> Of course, any military move by the strongman that threatened Saudi oil fields  would reignite price increases.  </P> <P> The brokers judge the market's course using information from any number of  sources. They try to gauge the sentiment of the market by talking to their  customers and floor brokers, by evaluating the meaning of the orders they have  received and sometimes by simply listening to the level of background noise  when they call the trading pit.  </P> <P> They pay close heed to any news on oil supply, such as Thursday's bulletin that  UltraMar Inc. was closing its catalytic "cracker" refining hardware in  Wilmington, Calif., unexpectedly for repair. The computer screens arrayed on  the desks also provide charts and graphs illustrating so-called technical  factors -- the internal market dynamics that are supposed to also influence  which way prices will go.  </P> <P> And, of course, some traders rely on hunches.  </P> <P> Because of the pace of the business, brokers must sometimes depend on the  single-line news headlines that appear on their Telerate information service  screens beneath densely plotted charts of petroleum prices. But a one-line  headline can't often convey enough about a complicated situation, and sometimes  the market misreads the summaries and moves forcefully in the wrong direction.  </P> <P> Thursday morning, one such headline reported: "Soviets will not join U.S.-led  forces," which might suggest that the Soviets were distancing themselves from  the embargo effort -- a circumstance that might raise prices. But the remainder  of the report, which didn't appear on the screen, said the Soviets were  apparently willing to take part in a U.N.-led effort.  </P> <P> Crude oil prices added more than 30 cents a barrel for a while Thursday morning  on the strength of a report attributed to the British government that Iraq had  closed its borders. But some people wondered later if this marked a change.  </P> <P> "The borders were already closed," said Lisa Morgan McNaney, who supervises  floor brokers for United Fuels, a New York futures firm.  </P> <P> Sometimes, too, traders try to purposely feed in misleading information to get  things moving their way. On Thursday, a caller asked Dean Witter broker Sandra  Weinberger: "Have you heard about anything being shot down?"  </P> <P> There may have been some grain of truth to the suggestion, or maybe the caller  had bought contracts at a high price and was desperate to inject some anxiety  that would move the market. "You always assume there's something behind it,"  said Weinberger.  </P> <P> The broker's job is not only to make money for the customers but also to  provide services that keep them happy in other ways. Sometimes the brokers go  to some length.  </P> <P> One of Dean Witter's customers is a French concern that regularly calls from a  speaker phone and remains on the line for many hours. The purpose is to be sure  that the customer has an open phone with a good connection if it decides to  place orders.  </P> <P> The brokers can't put the phone down, so they take turns cradling the silent  receiver. Once, Rothenberg sang the Marseillaise, the French national anthem,  in an effort to get the customer's attention. It worked.  </P> <P> Many customers are calling from overseas to get in on the action in New York,  and Rothenberg talks regularly to clients in Chile, Spain, England, France and  Japan. He speaks French and German, which he said helps.  </P> <P> The job doesn't demand the physical stamina required by working in the pits,  but most brokers on such desks are between 25 and 40 years old. After 40, they  go into administration, move on to jobs such as consulting or change careers  completely, brokers say.  </P> <P> Most brokers probably earn between $50,000 and $150,000 a year, Rothenberg  estimated. Only a few earn $250,000 or more a year, he said.  </P> <P> Across the front of Rothenberg's phone is taped a printed fortune-cookie slip:  "You will be unusually successful in business."  </P> <P> The job's worst nightmare, brokers say, is a mistake in executing a trade. If a  client calls in a "sell" order on a day when dozens of others are buying, it's  easy to mistakenly reverse the order. Then the house may need to eat the loss.  </P> <P> A lot of money is at stake. Prices have fluctuated by more than $2 a barrel in  several recent sessions. A move of only 25 cents adds or subtracts $25,000 from  the value of the 100-contract orders that are regularly called in.  </P> <P> One of the thrills of the job is calling a turn in prices and making the  customer a lot of money. "It's an instant gratification sort of thing with this  job," said Rothenberg, who grew up in New York and abroad and said he was drawn  to the business by the fast pace. "I could have been a bank credit officer, but  I wanted something a little quicker."  </P></p>

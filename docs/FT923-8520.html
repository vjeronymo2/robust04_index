			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / Miyazawa backs emperor's China trip MR Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, yesterday made clear his determination to go ahead with a proposed visit to China by Emperor Akihito in the face of opposition from both left and right in Japan, Gordon Cramb reports from Tokyo. He sanctioned a trip expected to take place in October and last nearly a week. The visit, intended to mark 20 years of normalised relations between the countries, would be the first by a head of state from the Group of Seven industrialised nations since the Tiananmen Square massacre of June 1989. Heads of government led last year by Mr Toshiki Kaifu, Mr Miyazawa's predecessor, have made the journey since then. An imperial tour is more controversial, however, because it would be undertaken by a direct descendant of the dynasty, at the time held in godlike esteem, which presided over the brutal occupation of parts of China in the 1930s and 1940s. The emperor, while thought likely to offer a form of words acknowledging the excesses of that period, is not expected to refer directly to post-war Chinese abuses. China has been among a handful of east Asian countries to express displeasure at a law permitting the deployment of Japanese troops in United Nations peacekeeping missions, fearing a resurgence of militarism. Similar qualms have also been aired among leftwingers in Japan, who are also displeased at attempts to endow the emperor with a more political role. The right is upset that Ziang Zemin, the Chinese Communist party chief who visited Tokyo this spring, warned against a Japanese military revival which it says a UN peacekeeping presence may presage.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Press communique" issued by the National Army of </F> Democratic Kampuchea spokesman on 30 April; place not given --  read by announcer]    [Text] I. Reliable sources say that ever since the  communist Vietnamese, their allies, and the puppets of the  communist Vietnamese and the United States were successively  defeated, first on the Anlung Veng battlefield and then on the  Pailin battlefield -- during which their troops and military  materiel were strategically destroyed -- the communist  Vietnamese, their allies, the puppets of the communist  Vietnamese and the United States, and the two-headed government  have not been able to recruit any new soldiers. They have also  failed to mobilize old soldiers.    II. Thus they have grown angry and are gasping for air.  They have shown their nature as aggressors, territorial  expansionists, exterminators of the Cambodian race, and foreign  lackeys. They have begged the communist Vietnamese to send  communist Vietnamese aggressors to intervene in Battambang.  Twenty truckloads of Vietnamese aggressor troops have been  dispatched to Battambang to help get their wretched troops out  of trouble.    III. The Cambodian nation and people and the National Army  of Democratic Kampuchea [NADK] -- who absolutely adhere to King  Norodom Sihanouk's national reconciliation and peace plans --  are uniting to thwart the dirty and deceitful plan of the  communist Vietnamese, their allies, and the two types of puppets  of the communist Vietnamese and the United States, who are  begging the communist Vietnamese to dispatch troops to help the  traitors and Vietnamese aggressor lackeys who have sold out the  nation.    IV. The Cambodian people and the NADK absolutely oppose  these people and will struggle against them. We are willing to  fight until we deal their final plan further serious defeats.    [Signed] The NADK spokesman    [Dated] 30 April 1994</p>

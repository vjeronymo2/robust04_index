			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / French truck siege amnesty France's Justice Ministry yesterday asked state prosecutors to drop charges against most lorry drivers who paralysed roads earlier this month with a 10-day strike, Reuter reports from Paris. But the justice minister, Mr Michel Vauzelle, told prosecutors in a letter to continue to press charges against protesters who used violence. He asked that charges for blocking highways be dropped 'for the sake of calming the atmosphere' in negotiations now under way.</p>

			<p><P> November 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TAKING THE MEASURE OF EGYPT'S NOBEL LAUREATE;  </P> <P> THE BEGINNING AND THE END BY NAGUIB MAHFOUZ (DOUBLEDAY: $19.95; 412 PP.);  </P> <P> WEDDING SONG BY NAGUIB MAHFOUZ (DOUBLEDAY: $16.95, CLOTH; $7.95, PAPER; 174  PP.);  </P> <P> THE THIEF AND THE DOGS BY NAGUIB MAHFOUZ (DOUBLEDAY: $16.95, CLOTH; 7.95,  PAPER; 158 PP.)  </P> <P> Conventional critical wisdom usually divides the works of Naguib Mahfouz into  four more or less distinct phases. The first of these, the historical phase,  borrows its designation from the subject matter (ancient Egyptian history) of  the historical trilogy that Mahfouz published between 1938-1945. The second  spans the period 1945-1957 and is often defined in terms of the dominant  literary technique in which Mahfouz then wrote; namely, social realism. The  realistic novels of this period established Mahfouz as a major novelist in the  Arab world. "The Beginning and the End" first published in Arabic in 1949)  belongs to this phase and is widely representative of the novels of this  period. The third phase (1959-1967) is sometimes defined in terms of subject  matter as "existential" or "psychological" and sometimes in terms of narrative  technique as "symbolic." To this phase belongs the second of our three novels:  "The Thief and the Dogs" (originally published in 1961). The third novel under  review, "Wedding Song," was published in 1981, and thus belongs to the fourth  phase of Mahfouz's work. Although more than half of Mahfouz's 50-odd novels and  collections of short stories belong to this phase, it has remained frozen under  the nondescript chronological designation, "the post-1967 phase." The cause of  this vagary does not lie entirely with the critics: The pace of change in  Mahfouz's style, narrative technique, and general orientation since 1967 has  been nothing short of frantic. No recognizable literary or intellectual pattern  has emerged yet from the diverse works of this period.  </P> <P> Questions of periodization aside, Mahfouz's art rests primarily on its powerful  evocation of the social and psychological reality of that segment of Egyptian  society with which he is intimately familiar: the Cairene petite bourgeoisie.  Mahfouz undertakes this task of representation with a seemingly unshakable  faith in the referential power of language and of contrived fictional  structures to deliver reality. As a result, his novels often appear blissfully  oblivious to the problematics of self-consciousness and singularly uninterested  in theoretical questions about the arbitrary nature of linguistic signs or the  transparency of writing strategies and literary devices. Therefore, readers  weaned on the pervasive presence of these concerns in modernist and  post-modernist writing will inevitably find Mahfouz's novels somewhat quaint,  if not altogether passe.  </P> <P> In structure and narrative technique, Mahfouz's fiction shows greater affinity  with the main tradition of the Western novel than it does with the indigenous  narrative forms prevalent in Arab culture. This is particularly true of the  first three phases of his career. In part, this anomaly is the product of  historical circumstances: The novel genre was borrowed into Arab culture from  the West during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Although an impressive  narrative tradition existed in Arabic (witness the "Arabian Nights") there were  no Arabic novels in the Western sense of the term before 1913. (Mahfouz was  born in 1911). It is hardly surprising, therefore, that Mahfouz and the  pioneering Arab writers of his generation, should strive to emulate Western  models of the genre even as they were acclimatizing it in Arabic.  </P> <P> To the inexorable pressures of historical urgency, however, one must add  Mahfouz's personal aptitude: In his public pronouncements, Mahfouz makes no  secret of his philosophical and intellectual identification with the secular  outlook of modern Western civilization. Moreover, it is precisely because the  novel has expressed more fully than any other literary genre the scientific and  secular principles of this civilization that it has exercised such a formative  influence on his imagination and literary sensibility. The preponderance of  secular Western ideas in Mahfouz's fiction is therefore entirely consistent  with his philosophical and artistic commitment.  </P> <P> Hence a potential irony: In the works of this major Arab novelist one  encounters the ideas of Schopenhauer, Darwin, Marx, and Freud more often than  those of any Arab or Islamic thinker. In fact, the collective genius of  Arab/Islamic civilization is invoked by reference and allusion in Emil Habiby's  single novel, "The Pessoptimist," more than it is in all of Mahfouz's novels  combined. The increasing recourse to indigenous and traditional forms of  narrative and storytelling one detects in the works of younger Arab writers in  Egypt (e.g. Jamal al-Ghaytani) and elsewhere in the Arab world may be a  reaction against the excessive reliance of Mahfouz and his generation on  Western fictional models.  </P> <P> These unsettling contradictions notwithstanding, Mahfouz's supreme contribution  to the art of the Arabic novel lies safely beyond doubt. In the long run, his  cultivation of a functional literary Arabic prose capable of capturing the  nuanced rhythms of daily life in a bustling metropolis may emerge as his  greatest lasting contribution to this literary tradition.  </P> <P> Perforce, much of the pleasure that accrues from reading Mahfouz's supple and  perfectly controlled prose in Arabic will elude the reader of his novels in  translation, no matter how adequate the translation. And the translation of the  three novels under review is not only adequate but actually quite good. The  flavor, however, is there, and it is well preserved in Mahfouz's tightly  constructed plots with their neat closures, compelling psychological portrayals  and lifelike characters whose genuine passions elevate them at the moment of  death to a kind of heroic status that their humdrum petit-bourgeois existence  had denied them in life.  </P> <P> Of the three novels reviewed here, "The Beginning and the End" is perhaps the  least complicated artistically. Cast in the traditional mold of realistic  fiction, the novel is almost a case study in social stratification. The action  is set in the late 1930s in Cairo and evolves around the futile struggle of the  family of a minor government official to survive his untimely death. The  economic and social hardships exercise different and uneven pressures on the  various members of the family and severely circumscribe personal ambition to  move up the social ladder. As is typical in Mahfouz, innate disposition  conspires with acquired habit to motivate the characters of this novel to  transgress against a reified social system that lashes back at them with deadly  vengeance.  </P> <P> Although the events of the plot unfold in a uni-linear sequence of cause and  effect, the novel contains a considerable amount of suspense and many turns and  twists that never cease to fascinate us in realistic fiction. To help the  reader disentangle these mysteries, the English translation uses a different  font to distinguish the interior monologue and unvoiced thoughts of the  characters from the narrative of the omniscient narrator. This technical device  is used for the same purpose in the other two novels as well.  </P> <P> "The Thief and the Dogs" is written in the tradition of the psychological or  stream-of-consciousness novel. As in the normative examples of Western  practitioners of the genre (e.g. Joyce, Faulkner, Woolf), concern with the  internalized experience of characters takes precedence here over external  reality, and interior monologue replaces omniscient narration and description.  The few novels Mahfouz wrote in this style during the '60s announced the  emergence of psychological realism in Arabic fiction.  </P> <P> In contradistinction to the Western models that inspired these technical and  stylistic innovations, however, Mahfouz's psychological novels retain in full  their interest in political and social issues. In "The Thief and the Dogs" this  interest survives in the motivation of the plot. A deluded idealist (an  Egyptian Robin Hood of sorts,) seeks revenge from society for thwarting his  ideals of justice and rewarding charlatanism. Upon release from prison, he  takes the law into his own hands and wages a personal crusade against  imposters. Instead of the intended culprits, however, his bullets claim only  the lives of innocent by-standers before he himself is hunted down by the  police.  </P> <P> What makes this novel political is the fact that the societal ills against  which the contrived fictional action inveighs are directly referable to the  culture of political opportunism cultivated and sanctioned by the regime.  (Awareness of the constitutive relationship between the fictional action and  its historical bases has led translators of other novels from this phase to  append explanatory notes to the fictional text. Though admittedly cumbersome,  this practice is not without merit in referential fiction.)  </P> <P> In theme, structure, and style, "Wedding Song" reveals Mahfouz's post-1967  groping for new approaches to the fast- changing social scene around him. This  novel tells the story of a play: One of the characters in the novel recasts in  dramatic form the actual life-stories of his parents and their close circle of  associates -- all of whom are involved with the theater. The author disappears  shortly after the play becomes a hit, but before the novel proper begins, thus  leaving the characters (and readers) to figure out on their own such pressing  questions as his authorial intention and the relation between lived and  imaginatively rendered experience.  </P> <P> While the withdrawal of the author from the text and the attempt to mix genres  point in the direction of post-modernist writing, the appropriation of the idea  and structure of "Hamlet" to the Egyptian context is a typical Mahfouzian move.  On numerous occasions the characters draw an explicit analogy between their  personal lapse into moral depravity and crime (prostitution, gambling,  drug-dealing, etc.) and the large-scale economic and political corruption that  accompanied the open-door policy of the late President Sadat. The time is the  1970s, and this is Mahfouz's way of saying "something is rotten in the state of  Egypt."  </P></p>

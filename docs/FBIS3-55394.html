			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Andrey Illarionov, leader of the governmental group  on analysis and planning, declared Thursday that the signing of  the agreement on unification of Belarus' and Russia's monetary  systems and formation of a ruble space of these two republics  "are dangerous and destructive."    He said the agreement provides for creation of "two emission  centers or two central banks with a single currency, the ruble."  However, as he underlined, it does not provide for efficient  mechanisms to control emission.    Consequently, Illarionov summarized, "there appears an  opportunity for Belarusian residents to transfer monetary funds,  bypassing the Central Bank of Russia." "Belarusian residents  receive an opportunity to compensate their expenditures at the  expense of the Russian Federation," he added.    Illarionov reported that the agreement between Russia and  Belarus also provides for the creation of a joint fund of gold  and currency reserves and "it will be a hard burden for Russia  as it is quite obvious that Belarus has no such reserves."    According to Illarionov, creation of such a single monetary  system could become an additional stimulus for the inflationary  process in Russia, totaling 10 percent. "At the same time such  an agreement creates a precedent for other CIS republics to sign  agreements with Russia on similar conditions," he noted.    Illarionov also reported that according to the governmental  working center of economic reforms, in December inflation was  10.9 percent (according to the state statistics committee -- 12  percent) and will remain the same until April 1994. After that  "there could be a substantial rise in the level of inflation,"  he believes.    The working center reports that the industrial production  level remained stable over the last 5 months but the number of  unemployed is growing. In December there were already 1.5 Mn  [million] unemployed in Russia or 1.2 percent of Russia's  employable population.    "Growth in unemployment is the reaction of the Russian  economy to the toughening of the government's monetary policy,"  said Illarionov.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Maroni Rules Out Nazi Effect on </F> European Vote"]    [Excerpts] (ANSA) Rome, May 17 -- Italian Interior Minister  Roberto Maroni said here this evening that he expects  intimidation by Nazi extreme right groups or other "criminal  phenomena" to play no role when the Italians go to the polls in  the European elections next month.    The role of swastika-toting Nazis and other extreme  rightists  in the new Italian political scenario hit the headlines when  hundreds of mostly youngish shaven-headed, leather-jacketed Nazi  skinheads marched the streets in Vicenza on Saturday afternoon  [14 May].    "I don't think the Nazi skinheads or other criminal  phenomena  can influence the regular prosecution of the coming European and  local elections," said Maroni, who reacted to the local  prefect's failure to ban the march by recalling the local police  chief and the local representative of the central executive to  Rome. "Everything is ready, we've taken every precaution, and  everything will proceed with the maximum of calm and order, even  in the hot zones," the minister asserted in a TV interview  broadcast this evening as a curtain-raiser for the election  campaign.    Chatting with reporters earlier, Maroni said his first  knowledge of the Nazi demonstration was when police chief,  Vincenzo Parisi, rang him and asked him to switch on the TV:  "That was when I learned of the demonstration." Maroni was  reported to be meeting Justice Minister Alfredo Biondi on the  question of pro-Nazi and fascist political activity later today,  at a time when hard-rightists with a neo-fascist past have been  given ministerial responsibility in an Italian government for  the first time since World War II.    In the furore surrounding Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's  appointment of National Alliance ministers and undersecretaries,  Maroni's prompt sacking of Vicenza's prefect has come under fire  for allegedly infringing freedom speech. At the same time,  apparently unrepentant neo-fascist MPs from the National  Alliance filed a motion to repeal constitutional wording  outlawing the Fascist Party and attempts to recreate it.    Officials at the prosecutor's office in Vicenza said the  slogans on show Saturday were closer to Fascism than classical  Nazism and were "close to the limits" laid down by the law.  "The big effect was in political, rather than penal or public  order terms," said one official of Maroni's decision to recall  the prefect. "Certainly, there is a `bad' right and the `good'  right would like to exorcise it." [passage omitted]    The meeting between Maroni and Biondi was organised after  the  publication of a dismissive interview in which the Justice  Minister was quoted as urging the need to defend the right to  freedom of expression, even when it is an expression "between  folklore and cretinism". At the Justice Ministry, a statement  pointed out that Italian -- and European -- laws against the  violent extreme right had been extended two years ago when the  first recrudescence of neo-Nazi and fascist violence appeared.  "We have the laws we need to intervene," Biondi was quoted as  saying. "We now have to evaluate the phenomenon."    In his later gloss on the interview, Biondi claimed he  simply  asserted that it was up to the administrative authorities to  decide whether or not to allow demonstrations that "may seem  seditious or repress them as they develop. It is up to the  judiciary to assess whether the demonstrations are a crime and  therefore to be considered under penal law." [passage omitted]</p>

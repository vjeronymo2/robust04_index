			<p>920605 FT  05 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Marston deal with Courage MARSTON, Thompson &amp; Evershed, the Burton-on-Trent-based brewer, yesterday announced a reciprocal beer distribution agreement with Courage, its fifth such alliance in the past month, writes Philip Rawstorne. From mid-July, Marston will add a range of Courage lagers and Beamish Irish stout to its range. It will also distribute the leading Courage ale, John Smith's Bitter, in the Midlands and north-west. Courage will add Pedigree premium cask-conditioned ale and Low C, the lower calorie bottled beer, to its portfolio. Marston, in which the Whitbread Investment Company has yet to reduce its 31.4 per cent shareholding to comply with the government beer orders, has already signed similar deals with Wolverhampton &amp; Dudley, Scottish &amp; Newcastle, Allied, and Bass.</p>

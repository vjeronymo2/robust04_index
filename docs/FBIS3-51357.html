The Caribbean delegates include Yves Renard, executive  director of the Caribbean Natural Resource Institute (CANARI),  who served as regional representative on the IUCN council, and  David Smith, executive director of the Jamaica Conservation  Development Trust.    Lynn Holowesko, of the Bahamas National Trust, and  representatives of several other governmental agencies and non-  governmental organisations in the Caribbean are also listed to  attend the meeting.    They will be joined by other leading experts on the  environment and development from around the world, to discuss  the major environmental issues of the time, a statement from  CANARI said.    The theme for the January 18-26 meeting is "Caring for the  Earth and Its People."    Participants will address issues such as the implementation  of the convention of biological diversity, the formulation of  policies on the sustainable utilisation of living natural  resources, and the incorporation of environmental care in human  ethics, CANARI added.    They will also explore "the Caribbean experiences and its  approaches to conservation, natural resource management and  sustainble development."    Every three years, members of the IUCN get together to set  the policy and direction that the union will follow over the  next three years.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: Compiled by </F> Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovsiky, Edited by Vladimir  Shishlin]    [Text] An exclusive interview granted by the Georgian  leader to Interfax on his return from the United States.    Cor.: You have told the Georgian press that the aims of your  visit to the United States have been achieved. To what extent  does that apply to the Abkhazian conflict, and what part is  Russia expected to play in the settlement of that conflict?    Eduard Shevardnadze: President Bill Clinton and I have  reached mutual understanding on all principal issues, above all  that of deploying an international peace-keeping force in  Abkhazia. This is a difficult matter in practical terms. It  poses two problems: First of all, the U.N. Security Council has  to take a special decision to that effect, and, secondly, funds  have to be raised for it.    The latter problem has practically been solved in the course  of my visit to America. I have support in that matter both from  the president himself and from appropriate quarters in the U.S.  Congress.    This was followed by a meeting of the U.N. Security Council,  but before that I had a meeting with U.N. Secretary General  Butrus Butrus-Ghali, at which we gave detailed consideration to  all the problems the Abkhazian conflict involves. At the  Security Council meeting, I spoke about what had happened in  Abkhazia, about the causes and consequences of those events and  about the present-day situation there. I gave all things their  proper names.    The representatives of Russia, the United States, Britain,  China, France and other Security Council member states expressed  full support for Georgia's policy to settle the conflict. They  stressed the need to preserve the territorial integrity and  sovereignty of Georgia.    The proposal to urgently send an international peace-keeping  force to Abkhazia was supported by practically all members of  the Security Council.    There's something I'd like to make a special mention of  here.  Abkhazian separatist leader Vladislav Ardzinba tried to get to  the rostrum of the Security Council in those days. They banned  him from it, because he is not the head of a sovereign state.  Then he gave a news conference at which, some journalists said,  he was giving unintelligible answers and sounded fairly  unconvincing altogether. He said there, for example, that  bringing a peace-keeping force into Abkhazia would mean its  occupation. I said in the United States that if that is  occupation all of us should move to another planet.    As for the degree of Russia's participation in that really  important process, it is certainly vast. What in fact is  happening is coordinated joint action.    May I just remind that, before I went to the United States,  President Boris Yeltsin came to Tbilisi and we signed the Treaty  on Friendship, Good-Neighborly Relations and Cooperation. After  that, the Georgian parliament ratified the documents formalizing  our country's membership in the CIS. So after much effort we  came round to seeing the need for consecutive cooperation within  the Commonwealth to establish lasting peace in Georgia, and  consequently in the entire Caucasus, which is in the vital  interest of Russia as well.    It is the principle of Georgia that it is wrong today to  divide the planet into "our own" and "somebody else's" regions.  It is the duty of humankind to take to heart any problem that  can become a source of a great tragedy no matter where such a  problem arises.    The democratic forces in all countries which value democracy  and constructive cooperation should come together. As we get  rid of the consequences of the Cold War and internal conflicts,  it must be one of our priorities to unite in fighting  reactionary and conservative forces, wherever they rear their  heads. It seems to me that a U.N. Security Council decision to  deploy a peace-keeping force in Abkhazia would be an essential,  and possibly the principal contribution to the breaking of the  "Abkhazian deadlock," and hence to the elimination of one of the  sources of danger. The voting on a resolution to that effect  will be preceded by a speech that Butrus- Ghali is due to make  at the meeting of March 21. The main point is that such a step  should be taken under the aegis of the United Nations. This is  today the most fair solution possible.    Corr.: What do you think of the Georgian parliament's  decision declaring the Abkhazian parliament an illegal body?    E.S.: I think that was a rather rash step to take, and  possibly not very justified in tactical terms. But essentially  it does not contradict the political situation in general.    Corr.: What decisions do you expect to be made by the  forthcoming congress of the Union of Citizens of Georgia of  which you are the head?    E.S.: In brief terms, the aim of that organization is to  help stabilize the situation in the country, make the democratic  reforms irreversible, increase the influence in society of those  forces which are absolutely consistent in their determination to  lead Georgia out of its economic crisis, and put an end to all  forms of crime.    The decisions of the congress will help solve our most  serious problems.</p>

			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / Food discounters grow swiftly Discounters made up the fastest-growing sector of the retail food trade last year with a 22 per cent increase in total floorspace, says Verdict, the retail research group, in its annual report on food discounting published today. The Verdict document is one of two reports published today which predict that UK retailers face the twin threats of a discount revolution and an invasion by powerful US retailers. Verdict says discounters - low-cost, low-margin operators which aim to offer the lowest possible prices - generated sales of Pounds 4.8bn in 1993. This gave them 9.8 per cent of the grocery market, up from 8.8 per cent the year before. The report forecasts that by 1997, food discounters will have turnover of Pounds 8.4bn and a 14.2 per cent share. Corporate Intelligence, the retail research group, says the UK and continental Europe face an invasion of a 'new wave' of US retailers, many of them price-led oper-ators. These range from small retailers to the very biggest, including Kmart, which has already opened in the Czech Republic, and Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer with sales last year of Dollars 55.5bn (Pounds 37bn). Corporate Intelligence says that companies known to be interested or believed to be coming to Europe soon are fashion retailers Liz Claiborne, Ann Taylor, Leslie Fay and The Limited, DIY chain Home Depot, and general discounter Wal-Mart. The report says many are likely to use the UK as a launchpad to expand into the rest of Europe. Food Discounters 1994; Food Pricing Research. Verdict,112 High Holborn, London WC1. Pounds 395.

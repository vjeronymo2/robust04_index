			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yacine Lahcene: "Why Does the Islamic Salvation </F> Front Not Want To Stop Terrorism? Some Truths About the Armed  Groups" -- first paragraph is LIBERTE introduction]    [Text] The meeting between Layada, who at the time was an  "emir" of the GIA [Armed Islamic Group], and Abderazak Redjam,  who was in charge of information for the dissolved Islamic  Salvation Front [FIS], well illustrates this determination by  the FIS to take over terrorism.    When Boukhamkham and Djeddi say that their bosses have made  no commitment to bring an end to terrorism, they know whereof  they speak. However the FIS, the initiator of the violence, does  not control the armed groups; it is but one part of them.    The student has sort of surpassed his teacher. But the  dissolved party has never given up in its attempt to take over  the terrorist groups. But this effort has been in vain, since  the terrorist bosses cut the hierarchical link before the  legislative elections, since they thought that the FIS's two  leaders had failed in their mission to establish an Islamic  state.    The meeting between Layada, who at the time was an "emir" of  the GIA, and Abderazak Redjam, who was in charge of information  for the dissolved FIS, well illustrates this determination by  the FIS to take over terrorism.    At the beginning of 1993, the two men held a meeting in  El-Biar, at La Scala, at the insistence of Redjam. It was  decided to suspend the publication of the ENNAFIR (Redjam) and  ECHAHADA (Layada) newsletters because their contents were  contradictory. It was also decided to suspend the "Wafa" pirate  radio station, whose news regarding the GIA's actions was  untruthful.    Indeed, during each program, that radio station announced  that "thousands" of police and soldiers had been killed, that  there had been epic scuffles, and other wildly inflated stories.    But the meeting also addressed "the drawing up of a joint  working platform in anticipation of a congress that would bring  together all clandestine factions and the leadership of the  dissolved FIS." Redjam's attempt to take over is clear.    For the second meeting, Layada demanded that Mohamed Said,  whose real name is Lounis Belkacem, be present, "for more  credibility." The latter would not come and Layada refused to  continue the discussions with Redjam. Another member of the FIS  similarly issued an invitation to the GIA for the same purpose.  A dispirited Omar El Eulmi, the president of the SIT [Islamic  Labor Syndicate], was working under the command of Mansouri El  Miliani. He charged Djaafar El Afghani with pleading his cause  with Layada.    Layada received him in a hut next to the Draa-Dis Mosque. "I  expressed my wish to see El Eulmi join our organization, which  lacked a figure of his stature in the religious area," Layada  would say.    He would go on to say that it was on the basis of El Eulmi's  fatwas that elements from the armed groups had become  uncontrollable, carrying out assassinations left and right.  Interference by the FIS is not welcomed by the GIA's "emirs,"  who are already faced with constant leadership wars.    So a defiant Layada stated that "the assassinations of  certain intellectuals was the work of the FIS's clandestine  leadership. Redjam had drawn up a list of intellectuals to be  assassinated by small groups that the police were not searching  for." The GIA thus saw its monopoly on terror threatened by the  FIS. Also money was at the root of quarrels between the  dissolved party and the armed movement. A major call for a  return to order was necessary before Iqbal Madani returned some  of the money he was holding in Morocco.    How are the huge sums that come from holdups, racketeering,  and gifts managed? The way in which the money coming from the  holdup of the BEA [Algerian External Bank] on Rue de la Liberte  was used will provide an idea: 100,000 French francs [Fr] were  given to Abassi Madani's son Iqbal by Hocine Abdelhamid to  "acquire weapons from Morocco and bring them in."    Did Madani Iqbal abscond with the money? "These weapons did  not arrive," Layada said. He met Madani Iqbal at the Khaled  Hotel in Oujda. He demanded from him the money that had been  collected abroad "while making a death threat against him."  Madani Iqbal acknowledged the facts and hinted that the  Fr100,000 had helped purchase the PM Uzis, which had been  brought into Algeria. With Zaoui Ahmed present, "next the money  collected by Madani Iqbal abroad, and which amounted to 750,000  dollars, was deducted." Doubtful that these funds had really  helped purchase weapons, Layada made him "sign an IOU." To  demonstrate "his good conduct with regard to the armed Islamic  groups," Madani Iqbal offered Layada a batch of weapons hidden  in his Mercedes. Madani Iqbal had purchased six other luxury  vehicles and driven them into Algeria.    When the events and the statements by the arrested  terrorists  have been reviewed, it becomes clear that the GIA, often led by  semi-illiterates, is but a fragile assemblage of small groups  led by local emirs who derive their authority from violence. The  first groups formed before the electoral process was interrupted.    Layada would be quick to be put on the scent of these new  armed groups being put together. At a meeting at the Bachir  El-Ibrahimi Mosque, the decision was made to "make contact with  the other groups being put together so as to be better  acquainted and adopt a common action strategy, and to move  directly to armed action if that is necessary." One week later,  representatives from the armed groups in Boufarik, Blida,  Baraki, El-Biar, and the Casbah met at the Fares Mosque (Casbah).    A dejected Khiar Mohamed, upon being named the coordinator  for these groups, emphasized "the need to move to armed action  by declaring a jihad against miscreants and anything that  symbolized the state." Armed actions against representatives of  the security forces, which are symbols of the state, were  planned. The aim was also to acquire weapons.    So it was following the June 1991 insurrection that armed  groups began to form under the aegis of Chebouti Abdelkader,  Mansouri El-Miliani, Allal Mohamed, and others. They went into  action before the electoral process was interrupted (with  attacks on the Blida courthouse, the Guemmar barracks, etc.).    Layada went underground after the national gendarmerie burst  into his home in Baraki, where he had been with some other  terrorists. His life was saved because he hid behind his  sister-in-law and fired on the darak's captain. The latter did  not wish to fire back lest he kill the woman. Layada escaped and  hid in Blida. But it was the events in Tamezguida that were to  propel him to the rank of "national emir." Allal Mohamed,  nicknamed Moh Leveilley, the head of the GIA, was wounded during  the attack on the city Surete of Draria on 20 May 1992. He  charged Layada, who at that time was his official driver, with  reconstituting his groups.    Allal Mohamed "chose to work in isolation in relation to the  other armed groups led by Chebouti and Mansouri El-Miliani."  Hocine Abderrahim, the financier behind the attack on the  airport--who was sentenced to death and executed--, failed in  his many attempts to bring them together. For the reconciliation  meeting held in Zbarbar in April 1992, which was attended by  Mansouri El-Miliani, Chebouti Abdelkader, and Hocine Abderrahim,  Allal Mohamed had sent a representative. His attitude was that  "he was not ready to accept working under the aegis of Mansouri  El- Miliani or Chebouti because they were not action leaders and  thus could not measure up to him."    Layada returned to Algiers, to Draa Dis, so he could better  supervise "Moh Levilley"'s armed groups. Incessant harassment by  the police forced the latter to send his terrorists to  Tamezguida (Blida). Touati Achour, the emir for that region, put  storage rooms, which had long been readied, at their disposal.  It was then that the famous reconciliation meeting took place  that had been brought about in September 1992 by Allal Mohamed,  whose ambition it was to become the national emir. His argument:  "He had the hard core of the armed groups at his disposal."  Chebouti, "armed with an MAT 49," Allal Mohamed, "armed with a  PA, Si Ahmed Mourad, alias Djaafar El-Afghani--shot down in  Bouzareah--, "armed with a PA," Hocine Abderrahim, and others  were present.    The fierce leadership battle had begun. Owing to the  "disorder," the agenda was postponed. Chebouti kept his title as  national emir and each armed group would "continue to be active  in its area, according to its means." At dawn, the forces of the  National People's Assembly [ANP] intervened. "Each man fled on  his own without asking about the others." Layada, Chebouti, and  Touati Achour would flee on foot through mountains and on trails  until reaching Larbaa, where they found refuge in ammunition  storage rooms. Makhloufi Said, who had boycotted "the Tamezguida  meeting," was suspected to having collaborated with the security  forces. It was only on the fourth day that Layada learned his  boss had died. The post of emir had fallen vacant...    Towards the end of October 1992, in a bungalow, which a  woman  had made available to them in Baraki, Layada was unanimously  named national emir. A disheartened Afghan, Sedjane Khaled, the  main ring leader of the attack on Khaled Nezzar, was charged  with rallying the Afghan groups. Attia Sayeh, nicknamed  "Younes," who was assumed to have been shot, and Djaafar  El-Afghani's successor, was named the emir for the wilaya of  Medea. These armed groups reused the GIA's acronym used to  designate Mansouri El-Miliani's "dislocated" groups, the  majority of whose members had rejoined Layada. The two round  seals bearing the letters "GIA," which had previously been used  by Mansouri El-Miliani, were recovered. As an aside, they had  been manufactured in Pakistan. But it would not be soon before  Layada fell as well. In March 1993 he traveled secretly to  Morocco at the insistence of activists there and of whom,  according to Layada, there was a great number (especially the  "Afghans"), who had money and weapons and in no way felt  concerned by being in Moroccan territory. When there, they  explained to him that an Majlis Ech-Choura [FIS Central  Committee] had to be put together and that another "national  emir" had to be appointed, as he was accused of being "brutal"  and "illiterate." They wanted to substitute a certain Khathir  Ben M'hinda, nicknamed "Moussab," the emir of Constantine, for  him. The meeting ended without this being accomplished, but  Layada's term heading up the GIA was at an end. He was in fact  arrested by the Moroccan [police]. Sid Ahmed Mourad succeeded  him under circumstances that are totally unknown. As his  temporary replacement, since he was killed last March, it has  been reported that Sayeh Attia has been named. But for some days  now, Attia as well is reported to have been killed. Does a new  boss need to be sought from among the names that have been  mentioned? In any event, the succession is a "tantalizing" one  in view of the booty held by the GIA and confirmed by Layada.</p>

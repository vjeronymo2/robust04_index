			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> BEST BETS: A 7-COURSE CAUSE  </P> <P> One of the great pleasures in life, of course, is food. And what could be more  pleasurable than a professionally prepared gourmet dinner? Well, a seven-course  culinary delight prepared by five chefs.  </P> <P> One might expect such a souper to carry a sizable bill. But if proceeds benefit  a deserving cause, wouldn't it be worth it?  </P> <P> "The Fifth Annual Ultimate Dining Experience" on May 20 at the Hyatt Westlake  Plaza is such an event. For $75 a plate, patrons can enjoy dishes such as  charred lavender and black pepper ahi, smoked chicken cannelloni and poached  veal tenderloin with saffron-truffle sauce. The worthy cause: Conejo Valley  Senior Concerns.  </P> <P> "The evening is all about relaxation," Senior Concerns Executive Director Don  Hegarty Jr. said.  </P> <P> Sip wine and listen to a classical guitarist strum in the background. As each  dish is served, it will be introduced by the chef responsible for the course.  </P> <P> Proceeds will go to Meals on Wheels and the Fitzgerald House, both operated by  Senior Concerns. Meals on Wheels delivers thousands of meals to housebound  Conejo Valley senior citizens each year. The Fitzgerald House is a day-care  center that provides frail senior citizens with opportunities to make friends  and enjoy a variety of activities.  </P> <P> The reservation deadline is Tuesday. For information, call 529-5676. The Hyatt  Westlake Plaza is at 880 E. Westlake Blvd., Westlake Village.  </P> <P> The menu and the chefs:  </P> <P> * Charred lavender and black pepper ahi; Roger Pigozzi, executive chef, The  Biltmore Hotel, Los Angeles.  </P> <P> * Smoked chicken cannelloni; Bernadette Millet, chef-owner, La Cuisine de  Bernadette, Calabasas.  </P> <P> * Mango sorbet; Jeffrey Axell, host chef, Hyatt Westlake Plaza, Westlake  Village.  </P> <P> * Poached veal tenderloin with saffron-truffle sauce; Axell.  </P> <P> * California greens with carrot vinaigrette; Khosrow Mossayebi, executive chef,  North Ranch Country Club, Westlake Village.  </P> <P> * Poached pear William with raspberry coulis &amp; creme Anglaise; Albert Cruz,  chef-owner, Albert's Pastries.  </P> <P> * Petit four: Cruz.  </P></p>

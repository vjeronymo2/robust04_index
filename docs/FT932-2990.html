			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / International Company News: Study highlights Europe's sell-off plans EUROPEAN governments plan to privatise between Dollars 100bn and Dollars 150bn worth of state-owned companies in the next five years, according to a new study by Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank, writes Peter Martin. The biggest wave of privatisations will come in France, says the report, where the government plans to sell off assets valued at between Dollars 30bn and Dollars 40bn. Next comes the UK, with Dollars 20bn, Italy (Dollars 10bn-Dollars 15bn), Sweden (Dollars 10bn), Germany (Dollars 8bn) and Spain (Dollars 5bn-Dollars 8bn). The likely privatisations are concentrated in a few sectors, especially telecommunications (between 15 per cent and 20 per cent of the total assets to be sold), energy and utilities. Together, these make up over half the value of planned privatisations. Mr David Roche, one of the authors of the study, said he expected governments to be able to find buyers for these shares as long as interest rates fell and they offered appropriate incentives to buyers together with a stable political and regulatory framework.

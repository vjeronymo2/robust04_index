			<p>920626 FT  26 JUN 92 / Survey of India (28): Industry feels worried - Though corporate sales are up, the production index has fallen THE DICHOTOMY is almost absurd. According to the Department of Economic Affairs, the index of industrial production plunged from 8.5 per cent in 1990-1991 to -0.4 per cent in 1991-1992. Indeed, in manufacturing (as opposed to mining or power generation), the descent was even swifter. Here, the index fell from 9.6 per cent in 1991 to  2.4 per cent in 1992. Yet, at the same time, end-of-year company results unveil several islands of prosperity. An analysis of 875 major companies whose audited results have so far trickled in shows that aggregate sales rose by 21.1 per cent over last year. And the Economic Times Research Bureau reports that corporate operating and gross profit moved up by 27.1 per cent and 26.5 per cent respectively. The most outstanding company performance is that of ITC, a cigarette manufacturer. Its sales rose from Rs22.9bn last year to Rs30.17bn this year, and in the process it became India's premier company in the private sector. Delving into the figures resolves the apparent conflict between lower production and higher corporate sales. 'If one breaks down the results for the financial year ended March 1992, one sees that the profits of the first half do not really carry through to the second half. A large part of the apparent increase in sales actually reflects inflation and not higher production,' says Mr Rahul Bajaj, chairman of Bajaj Auto. The prospect of a poor monsoon, turmoil in the banking sector, high interest rates and tight credit head a list of negative factors that causes concern in Indian boardrooms. The mood is definitely one of uncertainty and anxiety. For large companies, and particularly consumer-oriented ones, possibly the most worrying factor of all is a fundamental change taking place in distribution patterns. I n I n d i a, g o o ds h a v e traditionally been distributed across the country by small, scattered and independent traders. By giving big companies between three to six months' credit, these traders also play a vital role in financing the companies from whom they buy goods. Apart from their regular business activity, these traders are heavy investors, if small in scale individually. The recent stock exchange crash after the Harshad Mehta scandal has hit them hard. In a knee-jerk reaction, many have been forced to reduce their regular trading volume, resulting in a Catch-22 situation. Companies meanwhile have been double-whammed: not only has a cheap source of finance dried up but sales have dropped to miserable levels. Will the traders recover? And if so, how quickly? Or should companies evolve new distribution patterns to fill the vacuum? Most companies are adopting a wait-and-see approach before taking more radical steps. If orders start trickling in, if the monsoon is not as bad as predicted, and if sales pick up, the old system may survive. The ifs are many and the cost of restructuring high. The next few years will be difficult for India's corporate captains for other reasons also. I n d i a is g r a d u a l l y but inevitably switching from a seller's market to a buyer's one. Facing real competition, both local and international, for the first time is not a happy prospect for industrialists pampered by decades of protection. What is the point of reform if it hits my business, more or less sums up the attitude of the majority. Moreover, companies which are dependent on imported raw materials have been badly hit by the government's policy on the partial convertibility of the rupee. With 60 cents of every export dollar now being converted at free market rates instead of the government's official rates, imports have become 15 to 20 per cent more expensive. A hidden subsidy has vanished overnight. Meanwhile, the high cost of money, combined with the demise of monopoly profits, is scaring off capital investment. More and more companies are re-examining the viability of their expansion plans. One key industry at a vulnerable turning point is the steel sector. Moves to loosen government shackles so as to boost total capacity have been over-cautious and largely ineffective. For example, before last year's partial decontrol of steel prices, Mukand, a leading Bombay-based mini-steel company, wanted to build a Rs40bn steel plant to produce 1m tonnes a year. Today, Mr Rajesh Shah, Mukand's chief executive, admits: 'We are having a close second look at the project.' In such circumstances, the fortunes of India's big business houses may resemble a wild game of snakes and ladders.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- THE TOP 20 BUSINESS HOUSES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Rank                                 Sales     Rank      Sales 1991                                  Rsbn     1990       Rsbn  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  1.

			<p><P> December 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIVISION III;  </P> <P> SMITH CARRIES ESPERANZA PAST ST. PAUL  </P> <P> Running back Jarod Smith ran for three second-half touchdowns and a two-point  conversion to lead Anaheim Esperanza to a 25-7 victory over St. Paul in the  Southern Section Division III championship game Saturday night at Cerritos  College.  </P> <P> Smith, who had 46 yards in 11 carries, scored on runs of five, 16 and two yards  as the Aztecs (14-0) capped the first perfect season in school history. It was  their first section title since 1979. They lost in the finals in 1980, '82 and  '84.  </P> <P> St. Paul (8-4-2) held a 7-3 lead when defensive back David Toruno apparently  suffered a broken leg while breaking up a pass in the end zone with 2:22 to  play in the third quarter. The game was stopped for 15 minutes while officials  waited for paramedics to arrive.  </P> <P> Two plays after play resumed, Smith scored from the five to give Esperanza a  10-7 lead.  </P> <P> Smith scored his second touchdown on a 16-yard run around the right side with  eight minutes to play, then ran in the two-point conversion to make the score  18-3.  </P> <P> The touchdown was set up by Esperanza back Mark Parlin, who intercepted a pass  by Al Borunda at the St. Paul 29 and returned it to the 16.  </P> <P> Smith's third touchdown, with 3:57 to play, also was set up by an interception,  by Derrick Reaves at the Esperanza 46.  </P> <P> Esperanza opened the scoring late in the first half.  </P> <P> The Aztecs took the ball at the Swordsmen 26 with 39 seconds to play after a  21-yard punt by Matt Lenzen. A pass interference call and a 13-yard pass from  Keith McDonald to Marcus Tayui gave Esperanza a first-and-goal at the eight  with 20 seconds to play. After two incomplete passes, Clay King kicked a  25-yard field goal.  </P> <P> St. Paul took a 7-3 lead on the first possession of the second half on Shawn  McKinney's 29-yard touchdown run.  </P></p>

The bank president, Ma Yongwei, said last week at a national  conference of bankers that the bank will control its lending  according to the policies of the central bank, the People's Bank  of China.    Ma said that this year the bank will continue its mandated  lending to support the State's plan for developing rural  industry and the fixed assets in the countryside.    In response to the growing demand for capital for the  countryside, Ma said, the bank's arranged loans this year for  various sectors in the rural economy are expected to surpass  last year's.    But because a market economy requires the country's lending  institutions to operate more commercially, the bank must also  consider the risks in extending credit, Ma said.    In a firm response to the government's call for strongly  backing agriculture, the bank intends this year to expand loans  for crop production by 25 billion yuan ($2.87 billion) from last  year, when it lent about 233 billion yuan ($26.78 billion).    Ma predicted that in 1994 inflation will exert greater  pressure on farmers to cut production costs. If inflation  remains at last year's level, he said, it will stimulate a  rising spiral in agricultural prices as well as in the demand  for bank loans.    In addition, Ma said the disparity between available capital  and the demand for credit will widen this year as the  Agricultural Bank must shoulder a heavier burden in buying State  Treasury bonds and co-operated bonds.</p>

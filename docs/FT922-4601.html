			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Shares call to NatWest TRUSTEES of the Mirror Group Newspapers pension scheme have called on National Westminster Bank to stop delaying and return Pounds 31m in shares which had been passed to the bank as collateral for a loan to Robert Maxwell, Norma Cohen writes. Mr Colin Cornwall, independent chairman of the trustees, said that pensioners face the immediate loss of their pensions because the schemes are running out of funds to pay them. 'A large part of the funds missing from the Maxwell pension schemes went to various banks, including NatWest,' he said. 'NatWest have been thinking about this for six months now and it is time they made a decision.' NatWest has said it will take its civic responsibilities into consideration when deciding whether to return the shares. It has said it believed the security to be sound, to have been properly taken and its rightful property in lieu of loans not repaid by Mr Maxwell. The bank, however, has declined to return the shares, saying the matter is still under investigation.</p>

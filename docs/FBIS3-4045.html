During the discussion, people's deputies were  enthusiastic in expressing their views. Centering on the  government work report, they aired their views on further  speeding up the pace of opening up, conducting scientific and  technical structural reform well, developing economy and  education in areas inhabited by minority nationalities,  safeguarding social order, and other items.    While attentively listening to the speeches of people's  deputies, Li Lanqing and Wang Hanbin took notes from time to  time, and exchanged views with them on certain issues. After  the deputies finished making their speeches, Vice Premier Li  Lanqing said: Last year was a crucial year in which our country  advanced toward the socialist market economic system. Various  major reform measures were promulgated. This involved many  aspects and faced great difficulties. A stable political  situation and social environment were needed.    Li Lanqing stressed: Doing price reform well is a key to  handling relations between developing reform and maintaining  stability. Governments at all levels must take practical  measures to control commodity prices within a scope that the  masses can bear. In particular, prices of food and vegetables,  which are closely connected with people's livelihood, must be  effectively dealt with. Only thus can various kinds of reform  progress smoothly. Li Lanqing also pointed out: China must  never rely on foreign countries to solve the problem of feeding  the people. It is imperative to assign agriculture a most  fundamental strategic position and develop it well.    While talking about the issue of economic development in  border areas inhabited by minority nationalities, which deputies  paid close attention to, Li Lanqing emphasized: The central  authorities have considered the development of areas inhabited  by minority nationalities as a major strategic issue. Yunnan is  rich in natural resources, and has many strong points. It is  necessary to give play to these strong points. First of all,  efforts must be made to strengthen infrastructure projects such  as transportation, energy, and telecommunications. We must  study how to make use of foreign capital for the exploitation of  natural resources.    He fully affirmed our province's achievements in developing  education for minority nationalities. He said: Many areas in  Yunan have persisted in developing education despite  difficulties. They have thus grasped the gist of the problem.  As long as education is developed and qualified personnel are  trained, any area can become rich, no matter how poor it is now.  To get rid of poverty, areas of minority nationalities must  vigorously develop education.    In his speech, Li Lanqing also expressed views on  transformation of government functions, promotion of clean and  honest government administration, improvement of social order in  border areas, and so on.</p>

			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / Swedish Elections: Small parties hold the key to Swedish political fortunes With opinion polls showing Sweden's Social Democratic party slipping well below the level of support it needs to win a majority in Sunday's general election, the shape of the new government is likely to depend on the performance of half a dozen small parties, writes Hugh Carnegy in Stockholm. The Social Democrats, rulers of Sweden for all but six years in the last six decades, look set to rebound from their performance in the 1991 general election, when they won only 37.7 per cent of the vote (latest polls indicate their support is now 43-47 per cent), while the conservative Moderate party of Prime Minister Carl Bildt, even if they do better than in 1991, are unlikely to reach 25 per cent. Mr Ingvar Carlsson, Social Democratic leader, is therefore favourite to form the next government. But the final outcome will be dictated by the strengths of six other parties, particularly by whichever of them succeeds in overcoming the barrier of 4 per cent national support required to enter the Riksdag (parliament). Mr Bildt is hoping that signs of a last-minute tilt to the right in two polls this week - and pollsters say many voters have yet to make up their minds - will be sufficient to cancel out an earlier strong leftward trend and enable him to reform his right-centre minority coalition with the Folk party (known in English as the Liberals), the Centre party and the Christian Democrats. However, the polls suggest the Christian Democrats, elected to parliament for the first time in 1991, may not get back in. Furthermore, all the indications are that the populist right-wing group New Democracy - which has given the government a vital cushion of support - will also be excluded from the Riksdag after suffering a fierce internecine war. Instead, the Environment party, which fell out of parliament in 1991, appears set to return and is pledged to try to block any new Bildt-led government. The odds, therefore, remain against Mr Bildt, barring a late, powerful swing to the right. But the outlook is still worrying for Mr Carlsson. Although Social Democratic governments have, for most of the past 40 years, depended on the left for a parliamentary majority, he is reluctant to do so this time, chiefly because of hostility within the left and Environment parties towards the tough economic policies now needed to close the gaping budget deficit and calm financial markets. Both the left and Environment parties are also strongly against Sweden's attempt to join the European Union, which the Social Democrats support and which will be voted on in a referendum in November. Mr Bildt seemed to strike a chord with voters when he called the prospect of a Social Democrat-Left-Environment alliance 'a red-green mess that would be black for Sweden'. Hence, Mr Carlsson has raised the possibility of an alliance with the Liberals, or perhaps the Centre party. On the face of it this would provide a stable government likely to produce an economic package sufficient to reassure the markets. Both the Liberal and the Centre parties have in the past co-operated on economic policies with the Social Democrats. But a formal coalition of that type would be a new departure. Mr Bengt Westerberg, the Liberal leader, has indicated he would be ready for such a coalition, but many in his party are sceptical. Among them is Mrs Anne Wibble, the finance minister, whose father, Mr Bertil Ohlin, fought many long and bitter battles with the Social Democrats when he was Liberal party leader. It may therefore not be immediately clear after results are declared on Sunday night exactly what shape the new government will take. If that is the case, the markets will be braced for another burst of turbulence on Monday to follow the interest rate rises and currency slides that pre-election uncertainty has prompted over the past two months.</p>

			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY DIGEST: LONG BEACH;  </P> <P> TROUBLED CONDO PROJECT WINS UNANIMOUS APPROVAL  </P> <P> A developer who took the unusual step of filing a $1-million lawsuit against  Long Beach residents who tried to block his condominium project saw his  building plans unanimously approved by the City Council this week.  </P> <P> About two dozen residents of the newly formed Zaferia homeowners group stormed  out of Tuesday's council meeting just before the 63-unit complex was approved 7  to 0.  </P> <P> While some residents welcomed the building and the moderately priced  condominiums it will provide, others called it an oversized intrusion in their  neighborhood of quaint homes off of Pacific Coast Highway near the Traffic  Circle.  </P> <P> The opponents circulated petitions and spoke out at public hearings to stop the  project, prompting Huntington Beach developer G.M. Peters to file the  $1-million suit against two of them last August.  </P> <P> The suit, known as a Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation, or SLAPP,  was dropped soon after the residents hired a lawyer of their own.  </P> <P> The council endorsed the project after hearing from backers who said it would  help relieve the city's affordable housing crunch.  </P></p>

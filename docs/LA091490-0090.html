			<p><P> September 14, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PANEL BACKS FIRST STEP ON FREEWAY EXTENSION  </P> <P> Moving from pencil to pavement, the staff of the California Transportation  Commission has recommended approval of a crucial first step in the  controversial extension of the Long Beach Freeway through South Pasadena.  </P> <P> Despite bitter objections from local officials and South Pasadena residents,  transportation officials recommended that the commission earmark $4.8 million  in a new master building plan to begin right-of-way acquisition for completion  of the heavily traveled roadway between the Foothill Freeway and Valley  Boulevard in Alhambra.  </P> <P> Even though the staff recommended -- and the commission is expected to approve  -- this first step toward completing the gap, it is far from becoming reality.  Still to be completed is the environmental process and a detailed plan of how  and where the roadway will be built, commission officials said.  </P></p>

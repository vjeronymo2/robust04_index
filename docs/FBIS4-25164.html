			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Willy Wo-lap Lam] </F>   [Text] A group of moderate social scientists has vowed to  promote social change in China through organising a series of  nonofficial journals and academic functions. Their activities  are centred around the Chinese Social Sciences Quarterly, a Hong  Kong-based journal that has a large readership in China.    Into its seventh issue, the Quarterly is edited by an elite  corps of mainland-based scholars who vow to bring about  evolutionary changes by fostering a "nonofficial academic  tradition."    "We believe in a people-based academic research as  distinguished from one that is officially sponsored," said the  Quarterly's chief editor, Deng Zhenglai. "Academic activities  should not be tied to any ideology, policy, or slogan."  However, he said that since they believed in deep-rooted  changes they were taking a gradual approach to solving problems.    The bulk of the 39 members on the journals academic board  are  nationally well-known scholars many of whom hold senior  positions in prestigious research units such as the Chinese  Academy of Social Sciences. They include economists Lin Yifu,  Fan Gang, and Bai Nansheng, sociologist Wang Funing, and expert  on international relations Wang Jisi.    Mr Deng, one of China's first getihu (individual  entrepreneur) publishers, has been putting out translations of  Western classics since the early 1980s. He is in Hong Kong to  promote academic links between the mainland and the territory.    It is understood that out of political sensitivity, the  Quarterly is published and printed in Hong Kong. However, Mr  Deng said a few thousand copies were distributed free to  research institutions, government units, and leading  intellectuals in the mainland.    The Quarterly also holds regular seminars in Beijing and  Shanghai.    Sources in Beijing said since the Quarterly had steered  clear  of controversial issues like political reform, it was largely  tolerated by the Chinese Communist Party. Such liberal leaders  as Politburo member and National People's Congress Vice-Chairman  Tian Jiyun have praised the group's research efforts.    In recent issues and conferences, the Quarterly has explored  issues including agrarian reform, the role of a civil society,  the clash of cultures, and the theory of "neo-authoritarianism".    The group will later this year inaugurate a new journal  called China Book Review, which they claim to be the nation's  first-ever independent publication in this field.    The group's finances come from sales of the publication in  Hong Kong and overseas as well as donations and grants.</p>

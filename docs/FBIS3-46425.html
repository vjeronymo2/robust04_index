			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Davos, Switzerland, January 29 (XINHUA) -- As China  deepens its reform and opening, foreign investors will be  allowed to operate in some areas in the country from which they  were once barred, a high-ranking Chinese official said here  today.    Speaking at a World Economic Forum's special session on  China, Qi Huaiyuan, director of Foreign Affairs Office of  China's State Council, said the areas include power plants,  railways, airports and expressways.    The dynamic Chinese economy was a hot topic at the forum,  which opened on January 27 and attracted about 1,200 officials,  entrepreneurs, bankers and economists from all over the world.    Qi briefed the participants on the achievements of China's  reform and opening as well as some of the new steps to be taken  by the Chinese Government.    Qi told them that China's gross national product (GNP) grew  12.8 percent in 1992 and about 13 percent last year.    He said, however, that China is not deliberately striving  for  a two-digital growth rate for its own sake. The rate for this  year is preferably at 9 percent, he added.    On China's foreign trade, Qi said that the import and export  volume rose from 20.64 billion U.S. dollars in 1978 to 195.72  billion in 1993.    Qi said that China's import in 1993 alone was more than 100  billion U.S. dollars, and a total of more than 700 billion  dollars of goods will be imported for the rest of this decade.    He expressed the hope that as a major trading power in the  world, China's status as a contracting party to the General  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) "will be restored as soon  as possible."    "China's re-entry will further stimulate the expansion of  its  trade and economic cooperation with other countries on the basis  of equality and mutual benefits and will also strengthen the  world's multilateral trading regime," Qi said.</p>

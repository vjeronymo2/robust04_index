			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: United they stand United Biscuits stands on the fault line in the UK food manufacturing industry and is desperately struggling to ensure the ground does not give way beneath its feet. Strong brands and international expansion have enabled Unilever and Cadbury Schweppes to move to firmer terrain. UB may yet be able to join them. Its ambitious Pounds 121m restructuring programme will now determine its fate. The 2 percentage point drop in McVitie's fat margins highlights the pressures in UB's home patch where raw material price rises are still hurting. UB may be able to staunch that decline if its promised costs savings are recycled into increased marketing spend. Promising growth in mainland Europe and the far east is also contributing to the cause. But UB's fortunes hinge on the US where most of the restructuring costs will fall over the next three years. Keebler is taking to the hills in salty snacks, trying to become a strong regional operator rather than a weak national one. The marketing and distribution changes in its cookies business also seem a textbook strategy; the only trouble is Keebler's competitors may have read the same book. Still, by ransacking the 1993 balance sheet, UB at least stands a chance of delivering some earnings and dividend growth over the next few years. The market may well appreciate those short-term attractions, especially given the underpinning of a 6 per cent yield. But the broader risk remains that in its world of scarce cash resources, UB will only feed its problems and starve its strengths.</p>

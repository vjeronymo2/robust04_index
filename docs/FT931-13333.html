			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Arts: Movement on the air - Radio AFTER THE Controllers came the Director-General, though in Radio 4's Sunday afternoon debate Airing the Future he had only a brief innings at the end of things, his rival debaters being senior executives from both the BBC and independent outfits, with some members of the public. He must have heard much that he would not agree with. He repeated what we should know: that the Corporation seeks the best talent, does not seek imitative work, is ready to adapt to changes in society; and he turned down a proposal made earlier by Joan Bakewell that the licence should be charged at 'a fair rate' of Pounds 140. The 24-hour rolling news was described by foreign correspondent Charles Wheeler as 'the worst idea yet'; Sir Robin Day, very cross, said it was one of the few good ideas the BBC had had. The DG did not deal with it. Radio 4's Saturday night Classic Serials move from next week to Sunday afternoons (another good idea). Last Saturday we had Gun before Butter instead, about Inspector Van der Valk, more familiar on television, here played by Ian Hogg. It consisted mostly of a soliloquy by Lucienne (Sophie Thompson), whom Van der Valk reckoned to have killed her lover Stam (Roger Hume); there was little detection, just adventure and romance. Nicolas Freeling's novel was adapted by Philip Martin, who also directed. Radio 3's Sunday play was another Stoppard adaptation from Schnitzler, Liebelei, now Dalliance. This too deals with honour among prosperous Austrians, but introduces a Schnitzler special, the guileless working girl. Fritz (Douglas Hodge) is dallying with Christine (Rachel Joyce), but more seriously, offstage, with a married lady of his own class, whose husband challenges him. The emotional acme of the plot comes when Fritz's friend Theodore calls on Christine to explain that Fritz has been killed in an 'accident'. The plot is trivial, but the comprehension of the characters makes it deeply moving, and the playing under Jeremy Howe was first-class, with Hugh Grant as Theodore and Hetty Baynes as Mizi, Christine's friend. Nick Ward's Red Sky at Night (Radio 4, Monday) was a kind of adaptation too, though Ward (who also directed) says it was 'inspired' by DH Lawrence. (It was introduced by a reading of Lawrence's essay Hymns in a Child's Life). The tale tells how Alfred (Paul Copley) quarrelled with his wife Katherine (Julia Ford) because he spent their money on booze, then was killed in a pit accident. The direction called up most pictorially the mining world of Eastwood, where Lawrence came from. The difference between poverty in Lawrence's day and our own was seen on Thursday in Octopus Boys, the first of Radio 5's series, The Collection. Lawrence would hardly understand it. What are these Giros? What is the YTS? Why are all these young people 'in care', whatever that means? How come they have flats on the council? Well, it is not strange to us, and writer Judith Johnson has caught it adroitly. Mickey (Neil Anthony), 17, on the run from a hostel, lives off Sharon and Kelley, who live off the dole; but what he wants is work on the Octopus ride at a fair. At the fair, he and Sharon (Sunetra Sarker) find Pounds 2000 of the Octopus management's money, and steal it. 'We could go to Barbados,' Sharon proposes. But the boys from the Octopus catch up with them. No happy end: how could there be? The vigorous production is by Martin Jameson. Radio 1's refreshing social concern was reflected in Saturday's Pink Pop, where the involvement of gay people in pop music was displayed in song and story. Presented by Laurie Pike, this was not one of their great investigative numbers, but honest, interesting, fair and fun. No 'helpline' attached to this one.</p>

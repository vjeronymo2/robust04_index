			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / International Company News: David Jones may be sold or refloated David Jones, the upmarket Australian department store business owned by the troubled Adelaide Steamship group, could be refloated or sold, according to its parent. Adsteam also told shareholders at its annual meeting the price for the retail interests 'must reflect the real and potential value of such a flagship business', and gave no hints on the timing for such a move. There has been speculation that there might be a sale in 1994-95, and that a float of the department stores could raise around ADollars 500m (USDollars 326.7m). Adsteam has already disposed of its other major retail interest, in Woolworths, via a multi-billion dollar flotation. Meanwhile, Adsteam is selling the core business of its Metro Meat unit to CITIC Australia for an undisclosed amount. The deal, subject to Foreign Investment Review Board approval, should close in early-1994, and be close to book value. CITIC is the Australian investment vehicle for Beijing-controlled China international Trust and Investment Corp.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Tino Oldani: "Revenge of a Free Marketeer"] </F>   [Text] A renowned technical expert--Dini "The  American"--goes from the Bank of Italy to serve as director of  the recovery.    Lamberto Dini as treasury minister: sweet revenge. The  former  general manager of the Bank of Italy should indeed be feeling  great satisfaction these days. For 14 years--from 1979 to  1993--with Carlo Azeglio Ciampi in the governor's chair, Dini  never had any actual power--despite his nominal position as  number two at the central bank--other than the ability to pursue  his studies and present scholarly reports at conferences. For 14  years Ciampi kept tight rein over all delegated powers, even  over the operation of the motor pool. The final blow came one  year ago, when the governor became prime minister and appointed  Antonio Fazio as his successor, bypassing Dini within the  internal hierarchy of the bank and thereby breaking with the  traditional practice of promoting the general manager.    In short, the "ostracism" that the guru of leftist  economists, Paolo Sylos Labini, boasts of having practiced  against free marketeers for several decades at the universities  is something that the 63-year-old Dini, a lifelong free  marketeer, had experienced personally for almost 15 years at the  Bank of Italy--until Wednesday 11 May, when he took the oath as  treasury minister in the Berlusconi administration.    That morning, for the first time, all the newspapers treated  Dini with great kindness, including those--such as LA  REPUBBLICA--that had been attacking him for years. The foreign  press--for which Dini represents not merely the only  recognizable face among the economic ministers but also the most  prestigious--were downright extravagant in their praise. The  FINANCIAL TIMES defined him as "well known internationally," and  the WALL STREET JOURNAL added that he is "well respected." In  wishing him well, Henning Christophersen, vice president of the  EU [European Union], cited Dini's talent as a "skillful  negotiator." It is an encouraging send-off for a mission that is  not an easy one: defending not only the lira but also--at the  same time--the credibility of the new government's economic  policy in the area of foreign relations.    It is no accident that Dini is better known and more highly  regarded abroad than in Italy. When he was appointed general  manager of the central bank in 1979 he was almost unknown in  Rome, for until that time he had always worked in Washington  with the IMF, of which he had become one of the central  directors. He is a technical expert who was trained as a free  marketeer and imbued with American economic culture, which  consists of few constraints and much pragmatism. Even his  hobbies were those of the average American: photography and  American football (he was a big fan of the Washington Redskins,  and even now, when in the United States, he goes to the stadium  to watch them). When--in the aftermath of certain legal  events--replacements were sought for Paolo Baffi and Mario  Sarcinelli, the initial candidates were Ciampi for bank governor  and Sergio Siglienti for general manager; Ciampi was supported  by the then treasury minister Filippo Maria Pandolfi, and Dini  by the left wing of the DC [Christian Democratic Party] and by  the then prime minister Francesco Cossiga. But Industry Minister  Toni Bisaglia, the strong man of the Dorotea [rightist] faction  of the DC, dug in his heels and vetoed Siglienti. Why? At the  instigation of a young colleague, Vittorio Barattieri, Bisaglia  had met Dini and was captivated by him, to the point that he  judged him to be the right man for Via Nazionale [Bank of Italy  headquarters]. In the end, Bisaglia got his way.    After Bisaglia left the scene, it was alleged that Dini had  the protection of Giulio Andreotti initially and of Bettino  Craxi later. The mere mention of this allegation, however, seems  to annoy the new treasury minister. To be sure, Andreotti had  made his acquaintance: it was in 1976, when as a director of the  IMF Dini negotiated a standby [preceding word in English] loan  of $500 million with the government in Rome, which was at the  time headed by Andreotti. The loan was of vital importance for  Italy, which had almost exhausted its currency reserves. Dini  also worked closely with Craxi in 1985, at the G-7 summit in  Tokyo at which time the Italian delegation, headed by the  Socialist leader, requested and obtained the expansion of the  political G-5, which until then had excluded Italy and Canada.  The document in question was drafted by Dini himself, who  discussed the most sensitive clauses with his close friend, U.S.  Treasury Secretary James Baker.    Other than these instances of collaboration, however, it is  hard to find any indications of a close political relationship  between Dini and those who for years had been cited as his  protectors. The fact is that for years Dini had been  isolated--and not infrequently disparaged--until Berlusconi  rediscovered him. Basically, the two men have more than one  trait in common: they believe in a free-market economy, and  throughout their respective careers they were subjected to  harassment and opposition but emerged victorious.    The challenge that now awaits Dini is one of those  impossible  tasks: to put the government's accounts in order. The fear is  that the Ciampi administration left behind a deficit larger than  had been announced. For this reason, Dini's first move will be a  careful reassessment of the true dimensions of the public debt.  As for the future, there will be no more maneuvering. The idea  of drafting the 1995 budget in advance is making headway with  two objectives in mind: to stabilize the ratio between the  public debt and the GDP, on the one hand, and to prevent--at any  cost--the initial symptoms of recovery from rekindling inflation.  <H5>  Biographic Note </H5>   Lamberto Dini.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Ma.S.: "Prime Minister Will Sign `Partnership </F> for Peace'"]    [Text] Yesterday, Waldemar Pawlak's government  debated "Partnership for Peace," Poland's treaty of association  with the EC, and a social contract. The ministers were obliged  to implement a UN resolution imposing sanctions on Libya.    --During his visit to NATO Headquarters in Brussels, which  begins today, the prime minister will sign a document pertaining  to Poland's joining the "Partnership for Peace" program. The  government authorized the prime minister to place his signature,  Andrzej Wieczorkiewicz (under secretary of state in the Council  of Ministers Office) told journalists. He also said Foreign  Minister Andrzej Olechowski will not attend the Brussels  meeting. Detailed principles of our participation in the  program will be subject to negotiations to be conducted with  those who will participate in it. Lithuania and Romania have  already declared their willingness to join.    --The Council of Ministers heard a report from the foreign  minister concerning the fact that the treaty on Poland's  association with the EC has gone into effect. In accordance  with an agreement signed in mid-December 1991, the treaty became  effective on 1 February. Poland his signed the treaty for 10  years, which does not mean, however, that we will automatically  join the Western European Union in 2004. But what will happen  is that, from now on, we will have influence on decisions made  in Brussels. Joint association agencies will be established.  The extent of our relations with the countries of "the 12" will  also be widened: Apart from trade, it will include the flow of  capital, services, and labor.    --Labor Minister Leszek Miller presented an up-to-date  report  before the Council of Ministers concerning work on a social  contract. This coming Friday [4 February], substantive  negotiations are to begin among the government, trade unions,  territorial self-governments, and employer organizations. Both  the Council of Ministers and its chief "are eager to sign an  agreement on social guarantees as soon as possible."    So far, the different parties have managed to come to  agreement on certain technical aspects. It is already known  that negotiations will be conducted in six groups. The  government will be represented by the following ministries:  Labor and Social Policy, Health, Land-Use Management and  Construction, and Education. Let us recall here that Prime  Minister Pawlak declared his willingness to sign a social  contract as far back as his inaugural speech in the Sejm.    When asked when the contract will be signed, Labor Minister  Miller refused to set a date. All he said was that the groups  will continue their work for several months, while the  negotiations are supposed to be "long and intensive." According  to a communique issued by the [government's] Press Office, the  Council of Ministers authorized Deputy Prime Minister  Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz to coordinate work on the contract.  Minister Miller, for his part, informed journalists that  supervising all of the work will be leaders of the Council of  Ministers Economic Committee (the committee subordinated to  Deputy Prime Minister Marek Borowski) and the Council of  Ministers Sociopolitical Committee (subordinated to Cimoszewicz).    --The government proposed an amendment to the Transport Law  and also debated devoting part of the Treasury's shares for  purposes of reprivatization. The ministers failed to reach a  decision on the issue.</p>

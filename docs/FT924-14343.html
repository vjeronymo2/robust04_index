			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / International Company News: Kraft closer to chocolate deal KRAFT General Foods International, part of the Philip Morris group of the US, yesterday moved a step closer to gaining control of Freia Marabou, Scandinavia's leading chocolate, sugar confectionery and snacks producer. Freia Marabou shareholders voted to change the company's articles of association by abolishing the rule which limits foreign ownership to one third of the capital. This was one of the the US group's conditions set by KGFI subsidiary Jacobs Souchard on September 28 when it offered Dollars 1.5bn to acquire Freia Marabou . Shareholders also changed the rules to allow new shareholders to acquire voting rights immediately. Under previous rules they had to wait four weeks to acquire voting rights. The only outstanding hurdle left for KGFI to clear before gaining control of Freia is being granted an ownership concession by Norwegian authorities. KGFI will also have to secure the backing of a majority of Freia's shareholders, but this was already accomplished in theory by a recommendation of support last month by Norsk Hydro, Freia's biggest shareholder, which controls 44.1 per cent of its shares. Shareholders have until November 11 to accept KGFI's offer. KGFI's bid for Freia Marabou was NKr450 a share but Hershey Foods Corp offered NKr425, or dollars 1.3bn to acquire the company. Hershey owns an 18.6 per cent stake in Freia. Mr Sverre E Koch, an Oslo attorney with Thommessen, Krefting &amp; Greve which represents Hershey, said that the outcome of yesterday's extraordinary general meeting weakened Hershey's position in its consideration to launch a rival bid for Freia. 'It is clear that Hershey's position was weakened by the outcome of (today's) meeting,' Mr Koch said. Hershey has been holding talks with Orkla, the Norwegian diversified food group, about launching a rival bid. Mr Koch said talks were still underway but no decision has yet been taken on whether to proceed.</p>

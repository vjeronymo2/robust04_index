			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Reorganisation at Sheldon Jones Shares in Sheldon Jones, the USM-quoted pet food and garden products company, fell 15p to 48p following the announcement of a rights issue, a capital reconstruction and increased annual losses. As a result of losses for the year to June 30, consolidated net assets had fallen to Pounds 293,000 with net borrowings of Pounds 2.9m. The company said net assets were set to fall further following the forecast of losses for the six months to December 31. In an underwritten 4-for-3 rights issue at 25p the company is raising a net Pounds 1.35m. It is also redeeming its 12.5 per cent/13.5 per cent loan stock mainly in exchange for new 7.5 per cent loan stock. It is proposing to split the 25p shares into 5p ordinary and 20p deferred to allow the elimination of the deficit on revenue reserves. For the year to June 30 pre-tax losses were Pounds 3.27m (Pounds 1.28m), mainly due to losses relating to the southern activities of the garden products division, which has now been closed, the Topwood Timber business, which has been sold, and the property disposal programme. The company is now mainly involved in pet food, plus the northern activities of the garden products side. It is intended to change the name to Pascoe's Group, the year end to December 31 and to seek a full listing. Turnover declined from Pounds 15.5m to Pounds 14.9m including a lower contribution of Pounds 6.56m (Pounds 7.49m) from discontinued activities. Losses per share increased from 22.48p to 59.75p. The pre-tax figure was after a provision for loss on discontinued activities of Pounds 584,000 and provision against writing down of fixed assets of Pounds 1.13m.</p>

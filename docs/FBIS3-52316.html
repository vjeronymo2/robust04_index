The vote was 62 in favor, with SHAS [Torah Observing  Sephardim], United Torah Judaism, and the Arab Democratic Party  giving their support to the Labor and Meretz coalition.  Forty-four opposition Knesset members voted against the budget,  and two members of HADASH [Democratic Front for Peace and  Equality] communists abstained.    Summing up the budget debate, Finance Minister Avraham  Shohat  said next year Israel will have to find solutions for the large  expenses resulting from the peace process.</p>

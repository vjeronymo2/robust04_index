			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Markheath hit by provisions PROVISIONS OF Pounds 3.87m for declining property values led to sharply increased losses at Markheath in the six months to September 30. The pre-tax deficit was stretched from Pounds 459,000 to Pounds 4.71m and there is no interim dividend, against 0.5p last time when the final was also passed. Mr Michael Rendle, chairman, said that in November the company breached its banking facilities - specifically two covenants - as its properties failed to generate sufficient income to cover all the interest costs. He added that discussions with its banks were 'progressing in a constructive manner' to try to renegotiate the facilities. The company said that the interim figures had been drawn up on a going concern basis, which assumes the continued support of the banks. Mr Ian Creber, finance director, said that borrowings, having fallen from Pounds 95.4m to Pounds 72.9m in the year to March 1992, had risen over the half to Pounds 78m, but that since September 30 had been reduced to Pounds 67.4m via the sale of the stake in Frogmore Estates for Pounds 13.1m. That sale should also result in a Pounds 3m tax rebate in 1993. In January a property sale for Pounds 1m was completed. The pre-tax figure was struck after charging Pounds 2.4m to the profit and loss account - the capitalisation of interest and attributable overheads to the carrying value of properties stopped in August. The sale of properties in the half totalled Pounds 3.17m (Pounds 3.8m). Mr Creber said the company had not been tempted to 'dump' properties, 'just to pay interest'. Operating losses grew to Pounds 3.23m (Pounds 2.49m), while income from properties brought in Pounds 1.57m (Pounds 1.29m). Losses per share were 4.03p (0.19p).</p>

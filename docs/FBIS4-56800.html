			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Cabinet Lengthens Supervision of St. </F> Maarten"]    [Text] The Hague -- The island of St. Maarten is to remain  under supervision. At Minister Hirsch Ballin's proposal, the  cabinet agreed to lengthen the current supervision arrangement  to 1 September of this year.    The decision gives the new Pourier government of the  Netherlands Antilles, sworn in on 31 March, the time to set up a  new administrative structure for the island.    The reason the government was put under supervision was the  financial and administrative mismanagement suffered over the  past few years under the leadership of local leader C. Wathey.  Wathey is the suspect in a criminal investigation into fraud  worth millions surrounding the enlargement of the airport and  harbor on the island.</p>

			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Survey of Computer Networking (12): Solutions more affordable - Open systems / Open systems often owe more to theory than reality Bill Bowmar is divisional manager of information technology (IT) at the construction arm of Trafalgar House. His company is one of the largest building concerns in the UK, with projects as diverse as the Humber Bridge and Malaysia's Pergau Dam to boast about. This working environment is not ideally suited to computer systems. Nobody lays out a motorway expansion site to please the IT department. Yet two-thirds of Trafalgar House Construction's 3,000 staff have a computer terminal. These machines are spread over 70 locations with links to projects as far afield as Hong Kong. The Pounds 4m inventory of computer systems embraces a raft of suppliers and software packages. The division has an annual IT budget, including staff and vehicles, of Pounds 5m. However, Mr Bowmar's colleagues concentrate on engineering projects. They are happy to make do with whatever IT equipment they've inherited, as long as it works - 'a construction company often grows by acquisition,' he says. 'We pick up computer systems as new businesses come on board. And we don't throw away anything on the IT side]' This attitude towards hardware and systems might sound economical, but it offers a real challenge to the network manager. He faces linking up local area network (Lan) elements in a coherent wide area network (Wan). Five years ago, that was Bill Bowmar's job. On the surface there was an obvious answer to this networking dilemma. Open Systems have long been touted as the panacea for networking. The term is self-explanatory, denoting mutual standards between different suppliers. This should allow users to mix and match equipment without worrying about compatibility. But Mr Bowmar quickly discovered that open systems owe more to theory than reality. In theory, an EC-endorsed international communications protocol known as Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) is the route to networking computers. In practice, there is still an annoying amount of adaptation involved in creating a trouble-free Wan. 'Computing and networking should be like Japanese hi-fi,' says Mr Bowmar. 'You should take the system out of the box, plug it in - and play.' Unfortunately, OSI failed to meet this simple test - 'we found OSI is not like that; it's very difficult to get kit from two suppliers to interconnect over the network. 'Our philosophy is that anything should speak to anything else, wherever the site is located.' Mr Bowmar's experience lead him to endorse a formidable mouthful of technical terms: Transport Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). This communications standard grew out of the US defence community. TCP/IP conquered the US's vast academic computer base as a convenient standard embedded in the depths of the computer but allowing machines to communicate across networks. TCP/IP is regarded as cheaper and easier to implement than the notorious layers of regulations that constitute the OSI model. To keep data flowing between the Lans and the Wan, Mr Bowmar called in 3Com, a networking hardware supplier. He wanted a sole outside contractor to deliver the routing and management computers that direct network traffic. This equipment cost Pounds 500,000, and established Bill Bowmar's definition of a rapport between supplier and customer - 'it's a good relationship, but we drive them hard,' he says. Sticking to one source simplified the question of protocols: in effect, Mr Bowmar defined his own standards. Despite initiatives from central government and international bodies, users still insist on giving OSI the cold shoulder. Richard Crisp, a communications specialist at McDonnell Douglas Information Systems (MDIS), is not surprised - 'TCP/IP is very much a de facto standard. It's extremely well-developed, it gives a fair fit in terms of connectivity.' Mr Crisp is pragmatic about the computer industry's habit of trumpeting the joys of open systems. He confirms the gap between the official term and the practice of stringing different systems together in a network - 'there are degrees of openness. It is certainly getting better.' Away from the bewildering world of communications protocol's and acronyms, open systems have produced one great benefit. Standardisation has made it difficult for networking specialists to differentiate between their products. Mr Crisp's colleague Dennis Lindsey highlights the consequences - 'open systems have driven prices down,' he says. 'Solutions are much more affordable. If I was buying a Wan eight years ago I'd have spent between Pounds 250,000 and Pounds 500,000. Today, you could get up to 12 remote sites on a Wan for Pounds 60,000 to Pounds 70,000.' The key to networking is to find an infrastructure that will support the customer's needs. St Paul Insurance specialises in high-risk operations, from hang-glider pilots to supertankers. Its premiums do not come cheap, and St Paul relies on constant exchanges of information between six UK sites to keep highly specialist knowledge flowing. St Paul uses computers from IBM, ICL and Olivetti, and expects to be able to pool data from these disparate sources without any problem. 'Just 18 months ago we had a series of Lans, but no infrastructure to connect them,' says Luke Bazzard, technical services manager. Rather than rationalise different systems that individual offices were comfortable with, Mr Bazzard opted for the black box approach. For Pounds 190,000, Californian Network Equipment Technologies (Net) provided Mr Bazzard with six network management processors. These dedicated computers took over the intricate labour of introducing traffic from one Ian to another. Luke Bazzard characterises his system as a 'postal service' with with TCP/IP and an industrywide protocol from Lan giant, NoveIl acting as envelopes that contain data. Net's contribution is to act as a post office. Mr Bazzard's communications budget is still Pounds lm a year, on top of a Pounds 6m IT budget. But with that kind of money in play, the Net system is a small investment in return for maximising market intelligence spread across a 450-strong operation.</p>

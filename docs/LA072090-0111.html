			<p><P> July 20, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TOP FUNDAMERICA EXECUTIVE FACES FRAUD CHARGES;  </P> <P> INVESTIGATION: OFFICIAL OF IRVINE-BASED MARKETING FIRM IS ARRESTED IN  CONNECTION WITH A FLORIDA STATE PROBE OF AN ALLEGED PYRAMID SCAM.  </P> <P> The top executive of the Irvine-based marketing firm FundAmerica Inc. was  arrested Thursday in Delaware on fraud charges in connection with a Florida  state investigation into whether the company ran an illegal pyramid scam,  Florida state regulators said.  </P> <P> Robert T. Edwards, president of FundAmerica, was arrested in Wilmington. He is  being held on charges of criminal organized fraud and unlawful lottery  activity, said Joe Bizzarro, spokesman for the Florida attorney general's  office.  </P> <P> FundAmerica, a network marketing firm, confirmed in a statement Thursday night  that its offices in Irvine were searched in connection with an investigation by  the Florida attorney general's office.  </P> <P> The Florida attorney general also issued a "cease and desist order" against the  company in connection with the investigation and accused the company of running  a scam that bilked state residents of more than $8 million. FundAmerica has 21  days to respond to the order.  </P> <P> FundAmerica's statement said the company was "shocked by the actions of the  Florida statewide prosecutor's office."  </P> <P> Clifton H. Jolley, a FundAmerica spokesman, said the company has been operating  for four years and that the Florida regulators did not attempt to contact the  company before issuing the cease and desist order. The company also said that  regulators did not understand the difference between a legal network marketing  company and an illegal pyramid scheme.  </P> <P> "If you're going to search our offices, for heaven's sake, search it for  something we haven't already given you," Jolley said. "We have fully  cooperated. This may have been done for dramatic reasons."  </P> <P> Jolley said the company was still operating, but he said the Florida state  actions would have a "chilling effect" on its sales organization. Authorities  in Texas, Florida and California are investigating the company, but Jolley said  the company is allowed to do business in California.  </P> <P> FundAmerica members reportedly were told they could save money on long-distance  telephone calls and airline tickets. The company charged people $3,200 to  become sales representatives, who could earn commissions and bonuses by  recruiting other representatives and club members.  </P> <P> Florida Statewide Prosecutor Peter Antonacci said that recruitment practice  constituted a pyramid scheme, which is inherently fraudulent because if every  eligible person were to become a sales representative, those signing up last  would have no one to recruit and no way of earning the promised return on  investment.  </P> <P> FundAmerica received at least $8.2 million in Florida through the sale of more  than 2,500 director-level sales positions since it began its Florida operations  in March, according to the office of Florida Comptroller Gerald Lewis.  </P> <P> More than 98% of the $33 million in gross income reported by FundAmerica during  the first four months of 1990 came from the recruitment plan, according to  Lewis' office.  </P> <P> Bizzarro, the Florida attorney general's spokesman, said there is an active  warrant for Edwards' arrest in England in connection with an alleged unlawful  pyramid scheme.  </P> <P> Florida officials said that FundAmerica's offices in Irvine were searched  Thursday by the Orange County district attorney's office. They said county  prosecutors and the California secretary of state's office are assisting  Florida authorities in their investigation.  </P> <P> FundAmerica officials in Irvine could not be reached for comment late Thursday.  </P> <P> The Associated Press contributed to this report.  </P></p>

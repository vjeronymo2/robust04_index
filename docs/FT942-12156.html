			<p>940430 FT  30 APR 94 / Sport: County boundaries - Cricket There was a time when county meant as much as country to young cricketers. Even such a patrician figure as the fourth Lord Harris, born to lead Oxford University, Kent, England and MCC with equal ease, was always a formidable Kentishman. Besides financing the county's cricket for half a century, he played his first game for them in 1875, when he was still at school, and his last against All India in 1911, when he was 60, the oldest man who has ever played first class cricket in England. He was captain of Kent from 1875-89 and chairman for 45 years, 1886-1931. Those were the days of colossi in cricket. These are the days of committees and I do not know whether I was surprised to hear so many officials assuring me that their counties thought of themselves not just as teams full of team spirit but also as counties full of county spirit. Middlesex, which no longer exists as a county in public life and which had always seemed to me in cricket life as no more than Greater London north of the Thames, insisted that all their members had a strong sense of county identity. Even John Emburey, born in Peckham, south of the river, has long since naturalised as a cricketer north of it. Middlesex's secretary, John Hardstaff, was sure that much of this feeling came from their rivalry with Surrey. The squad does have a fair number of players who come from Middlesex, including captain Mike Gatting, vice-captain John Carr, Keith Brown, Phil Tufnell, Mark Feltham and Mark Ramprakash. But outsiders too, such as West Indian bowler Neil Williams, often stay a long time. With a cricket market-place trading keenly in players, that is no mean achievement. 'We look after our players,' Hardstaff explained comfortably. Of the county spokesmen I talked to, he was the only one who spoke honestly about the problems of re-adjustment for county players returning from Test matches. Everyone else was too positive to be true, only mentioning the chance that Test calls give young and second XI players to play in top class games. Hardstaff sighed with sympathy for Tufnell, Ramprakash and Angus Fraser, just back from Test service in the West Indies. 'I don't know how they motivate themselves when they get back. I often wonder how they do it. Imagine playing in the heat and sun, photographed all the time, and then coming back to a damp day at Uxbridge . . .' Fame, glamour, travel, media and money combine to emphasise personal rather than team achievement and attract players beyond the quiet limits of county cricket. Alan Ealham, Kent's director of youth coaching, lamented the way this had changed in the last 15 years or so. Lord Harris would have been proud of his devotion to his county. 'As a kid I had always wanted to play for Kent. I never thought of playing for England. Kent was the height of my ambition.' Kent is a county with a rich sense of tradition and of a history studded with grand old men, from Harris to Colin Cowdrey. Ealham described Cowdrey as 'a father figure in the golden days of the 1970s. We all played round him'. Ealham was made captain of Kent in 1978 and, though summarily, and some would say unfairly, removed from the job two years later, he has remained a stalwart of Kent cricket. His son Mark is a county batsman and bowler. Ealham enjoys his coaching job. He is pleased that a lot of Kent's squad is home-grown, encouraging its programme of teaching and recruitment to 'keep re-vamping and keep going'. Yorkshire cricketers have spent the winter in schools, talking about cricket, but they need more money to do it in a big way, director of cricket Steve Oldham told me with an air of exhaustion. Still, more counties are trying to 'fly the flag' more widely, to interest people in the game. Lancashire are famous for their scouting and league system and they organise training and festivals for all age groups from under 13 upwards. 'We get our hands on our boys early,' I was told. Lancashire's problem lies more in hanging on to talent than producing it in the first place. The county is not alone. How can a county make itself attractive in the long term? Everyone I spoke to was convinced that success breeds success. If you win, people support you, rather than the other way round. Glamorgan can afford to laugh a bit at that, following a rise last year above the mire of habitual failure: from 14th to third in the county championship; winners of Sundays' AXA Equity and Law League; semi-finalists in the NatWest Trophy, with passionate support in all events. Leicestershire, in a grim patch at present, want to do something similar and have followed Glamorgan's lead in reducing their membership fee, (down to Pounds 15 at Glamorgan, Pounds 20 at Leicester), thereby sharply increasing the number of members. They are an odd lot in Leicestershire. Captain Nigel Briers is pretty well the only team member from Leicestershire. Last year's overseas player, Winston Benjamin, was thought to be playing only half-heartedly, like most of the team. He has been replaced by Phil Simmons. Tony Norman was appointed chief executive. Norman is a businessman, not a cricketer, and believes that Leicestershire must build county spirit by cashing in on Leicester's recent rugby success. Leicestershire staff I asked about this enjoyed being iconoclastic. 'We haven't got any county spirit. We're a collection of individuals. Always have been.' 'What about the idea of joining up with the rugby and football clubs to make Leicester seem successful?' 'Yes. They're keen on that. They've organised a few quizes and games. But not cricket games.' 'Is there much local rivalry with Northamptonshire?' 'A little bit. Not much. Not worth it.' 'What's the secret of being a successful county?' 'Winning.' Leicestershire need to find a new, stable system of management, as do several other counties, such as Yorkshire. The main thing to remember is that the only point of county cricket management is to enable players to do their best for a county they consider their home.</p>

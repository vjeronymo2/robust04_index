			<p><P> February 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REAGAN DUE KUDOS  </P> <P> When I glanced at Sam Hall Kaplan's diatribe column on the Reagans (Jan. 22), I  discarded it as so much piffle.  </P> <P> Then, I saw the bundle of letters from those fluffy heads who seemed to exalt  his pronouncements. I agree with them that his mouthings should have appeared  on the editorial page.  </P> <P> Somehow, I get the impression that none of you folk have accepted the fact that  John Kennedy is dead, but this ghost lingers on. No matter that the Reagan  presidency accomplished a hundredfold more achievements than the short-lived  Kennedy stint. No matter that the world is more at peace than in many decades.  No matter that the economy is robust, interest rates are still affordable, jobs  at an all-time high, inflation still wonderfully low.  </P> <P> I sense that the problem Kaplan and those others have with Ronald Reagan is  that he did accomplish something and that, of course, is unforgivable. Somehow,  a vast majority of Americans seem to share that view, but precious few of them  take the time to write letters to the "august" L.A. Times.  </P> <P> BOB WOLCOTT  </P> <P> Glendale  </P> <P>  The Times has received 59 letters on Sam Hall Kaplan's Jan. 22 column, all but  two agreeing with his comments.  </P> <P> </P></p>

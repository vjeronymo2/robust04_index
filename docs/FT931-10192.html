			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / Venezuela plans to sell off four power companies THE VENEZUELAN government, in an effort to reactivate its stalled privatisation programme, is focusing its attention on selling off four electric power companies this year. Mr Julian Villalba, head of Venezuela's privatisation programme, said this week the government hoped to obtain as much as Dollars 1.4bn (Pounds 920m) this year by selling its shares in Planta Centro, a large electric generating facility, and Enelven and Enelbar, two regional power generation and distribution companies. The administration also has plans to sell the state-owned electric company that serves the resort island of Margarita. The administration of President Carlos Andres Perez obtained over Dollars 2bn from privatisation in 1991, but saw sales of state assets decline steeply last year, when rebellious military units staged two attempted coups d'etat. The government, eager to obtain money from privatisation to help cover a large fiscal deficit projected for this year, may find it hard to sell important state-owned assets. Venezuelans are scheduled to elect a new president and national congress next December, and it is still not clear if the next government will pursue the unpopular economic reforms initiated by Mr Perez in 1989. The outlook for possible investors in Venezuela's electric power sector improved late last year after the government approved a series of staggered increases in residential and commercial power rates scheduled to continue after a new administration takes office in 1994. Aside from the electric power companies, the government also hopes to sell other state-owned assets this year, including an airline, horseracing tracks, hotels, sugar mills and perhaps some of its remaining shares in the national telecommunications company, CANV.</p>

			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Technology: An uphill struggle - Raymond Snoddy asks if HDTV programmes have any future in Europe's broadcasting industry Jacques Barsac is almost in love with high-definition television. He is not an engineer drooling over the number of lines in the new high-technology pictures nor a Eurocrat trying to devise an industrial strategy designed to keep the Japanese and the Americans at bay. Barsac is a French television director who has been making programmes in high-definition for the past three years. 'I don't want to work in conventional television. High definition is a kind of paradise. I don't want to come back to earth and be put into the jail of the little box,' he says. The paradise he is talking about is framed by wide screen, 16-by-9 ratio TV pictures with four times the present resolution, and the jail is the normal 4-by-3 box-like shape of existing TV sets. Barsac is part of a 350-strong multinational team which has been broadcasting HDTV pictures from the recent Winter Olympics in Albertville, France. It is the most extensive - and expensive - demonstration so far of the European high-definition system based on 1,250 lines and 50 Hertz using the HD-Mac standard. Manufacturers Thomson and BTS, the Phillips-Bosch joint venture, delivered a 13-hour-a-day service to 50 sites around Europe using four satellites. The pictures and compact disc-quality sound produced were spectacular by conventional television standards. Outside broadcasting equipment worth around Dollars 90m (Pounds 51m) was brought together and a total of 35 high-definition cameras, including the latest solid-state lightweight versions, were trained on everything from the men's downhill event to ice hockey matches. The French government, France Telecom and the European Commission combined to pay for the two-week Olympic channel which cost approximately Pounds 8m-Pounds 9m. The technology worked almost like a conventional outside broadcast. The real challenge for the Olympic producers and cameramen was to learn a new grammar. Because there is so much more to see in the picture everyone had to exercise restraint and realise that there is less need for close-ups or cutting rapidly from one shot to the next. 'The brain makes the close-ups,' commented Barsac. Chris Dingley, a senior cameraman from the Thames Television team at Albertville working under French directors, said he has been converted to HDTV. He is working on The Return of Columbus, the official European Commission high-definition film being made by Thames Television for the Seville Expo in April. Walther Fitz, a senior broadcasting engineer from ORF, the Austrian broadcasting organisation, is equally enthusiastic. He was involved in the coverage of the women's downhill event at Meribel and believes he was getting more comprehensive and compelling coverage of the event with six high-definition cameras than he would have done with 20 conventional cameras. But as the high-definition images from the Olympic closing ceremony at Albertville faded at the weekend the real question is what happens next. 'We have demonstrated that it works. Someone has to pick up the ball and run with it,' says Brian Scott, former head of engineering at Thames who is deputy director general of Vision 1250, the EC supported group set up to promote the high-definition system. After the Seville Expo, where all the stands will be linked by a high-definition service running at least 12 to 14 hours a day, Vision 1250 plans to move on to the summer Olympics in Barcelona and distribute the pictures to 800 centres around Europe. Despite the undoubted technical achievement, and the increasing enthusiasm of producers for making programmes in the high-definition format, a large number of difficult questions still need to be addressed. Who will start broadcasting a high-definition channel in Europe and what will it show? Will consumers be willing to pay Pounds 3,000, at least at the outset, for bulky new television sets or will the future have to wait until large but flat screens are developed? And perhaps most fundamental of all, have the Europeans struggled to catch the Japanese lead in high-definition only to be bypassed by the Americans? The US high-definition system is fully digital whereas both the current Japanese and European systems combine the old analogue with digital technology. EC money is clearly available to back European moves towards wide-screen television using existing D2-Mac broadcasts. Jean Dondelinger, EC commissioner responsible for audiovisual policy, recently described wide-screen television as 'an essential part of the evolution towards HDTV'. Sums of between Ecu 800m (Pounds 567m) and Ecu 1bn are being talked about over five years to support such a venture. An 'almost final' package on a satellite broadcasting standards directive includes an insistence that only HD-Mac be used for non-digital HDTV transmissions and that only D2-Mac be used for non-digital broadcasts for conventional 625-line television in the wide screen 16:9 format. Next month Ferguson, the UK Thomson subsidiary, will launch Britain's first wide-screen television which can receive a range of standards including D2-Mac. It will retail at Pounds 3,500. British Sky Broadcasting is considering launching a wide-screen version of one of its subscription film channels. This would involve a duplicate transmission of the channel in D2-Mac. The decision on whether or not to go ahead will depend on financial support from the commission and a judgment on whether, say, 10 per cent of Sky's 1m movie subscribers would be prepared to pay a premium to see the films in the cinema-style format in which they were made. In the US the perspective is different. Joe Flaherty, senior vice president for technology at CBS, the US network, warned that Europe should not waste time in planning transitions to the new technology but instead adopt an all-digital HDTV satellite and cable transmission system immediately. Many European engineers are, however, sceptical about how quickly the American system can be turned into a real consumer product. Fitz of ORF, which last year produced Mozart's Magic Flute and Requiem in HDTV, hopes that he can complete a hat trick by helping to introduce the new system before he retires in three years time. He was involved in the launching of both black and white and colour television broadcasts in Austria.</p>

			<p><P> November 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: RADIO  </P> <P> Snyder on KWNK: Tom Snyder is back on the Los Angeles air waves, heard nightly  from 7 to 10 on KWNK-AM (670), a San Fernando Valley-based talk station.  Snyder's nationally syndicated radio show was dropped by KABC-AM last spring  because of excessive pre-emptions during the baseball season. KWNK is also  starting a new magazine-format news and entertainment morning show that will  feature Dick McInnes from 6 to 9 a.m., replacing Randy Kerdoon who went to  KFWB. McInnes, who got his start working for Rona Barrett and co-authored the  autobiography of Dorothy Lamour, also interviews soap opera stars Saturdays  from 12 to 1 p.m. on a KWNK show called "S.O.A.P."

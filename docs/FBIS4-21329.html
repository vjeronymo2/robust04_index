Customs officers discovered 121  kilos of heroin hidden in a camper. The camper belongs to  German nationals (Juergen Maert), 31, and his wife (Dona  Annette), 26, who had left Turkey heading for London. During  the interrogation, the Germans told the customs officers that  they knew of the heroin's existence in their camper, and that  they were going to receive 100,000 German marks upon its  delivery in London. The drugs and camper were confiscated and  the two Germans will appear before the Alexandroupolis  prosecutor within the day.</p>

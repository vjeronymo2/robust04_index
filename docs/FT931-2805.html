			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / Firefighters threaten to strike on 1 1/2 % pay limit BRITAIN'S 49,000 firefighters yesterday threatened to strike if the government refuses to fund a pay award calculated under a formula which has been in force since 1979. The warning came from Fire Brigades Union leaders after a meeting with Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary. Mr Clarke insisted that no exceptions could be made to the 1.5 per cent public-sector pay limit introduced by the government last November. Mr Ken Cameron, general secretary of the union, said that if the pay formula was not honoured then a strike 'looks inevitable'. The firefighters' pay formula - introduced to settle a damaging nine-week national strike - works retrospectively each November, linking earnings to the upper quartile of full-time male manual workers' pay in the government's annual New Earnings Survey. This year's survey is expected to be published by early summer. Mr Clarke told the union that no decision had been taken to do away with the formula. He emphasised, however, that the government was not a party to it, as firefighters are employed by local authorities, and the government was not involved in pay negotiations. But he added that he could not accept that firefighters should be treated as an exception to the government's 1.5 per cent pay limit for public-sector workers. Mr Charles Nolda, the employers' leading negotiator, said yesterday that talk of possible strike action by firefighters seven months before their pay came under review was 'more than a little premature'. He added: 'The fact is no one will know for many months what the firefighters' pay formula is likely to show this year.' Shortly before the introduction of the 1.5 per cent pay limit the firefighters received a 4.9 per cent wage increase which was calculated under the formula.</p>

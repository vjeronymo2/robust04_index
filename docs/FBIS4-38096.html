			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, June 26, IRNA -- President Akbar  Hashemi-Rafsanjani here Sunday [26 June] lashed out at certain  countries pretending to advocate human rights and condemned  their support for the terrorist Mojahedin-e Khalq Organization  (MKO).    "These countries through extensive financial, propaganda and  political backing support a grouplet which is involved in the  bomb blast at the holy shrine of Imam Reza (as) [peace be upon  him]," the president said addressing the inaugural session of  the nationwide seminar on "judicairy week."    "Such countries provide the MKO with money, radio station,  office and diplomatic passports and support the manifestation of  terrorism and also open their gates to them," noted Hojjat  ol-Eslam Rafsanjani.    The seminar is held annually to commemorate martyr Beheshti,  the first chief justice in the post-revolution, who was  assassinated by the MKO terrorists.    The president stressed: "We attach no importance to those  countries and place no hope in them. However, we can offer the  world the best type of human rights based on Islam and Islamic  laws."    Referring to the progress made in the country, the president  stressed that the enemies are not totally disappointed and would  resort to vicious acts such as bomb blast at the holy shrine  which could please no obstinate individual.    "We know our enemies and understand that the hostility and  grudge they have harbored against the revolution is not because  of individuals. They are scared of the Islamic movement and of  the final triumph of Islam," he noted.    He called on all people to preserve their vigilance in all  dimensions, adding that they should also be prepared to face  more vicious propaganda because the enemies increase their  brutal acts as the country progresses.    Praising the martyrs of the Islamic republic, especially  martyr Beheshti, the president said that some 13 years ago when  masterminds behind the bombing of the Islamic republic party's  headquarters were hatching the plot, they were vainly thinking  that through the bombing the Islamic republic would collapse and  the way would be paved for the establishment of the type of  government they were seeking for.    The president pointed to the achievements of the country in  many fields and said that the Islamic system, by passing through  "arduous defiles" has now reached a path rather easier to pass.    Chief justice Mohammad Yazdi, Justice Minister Hojjat  ol-Eslam Shushtari and judges from throughout the country were  present at the gathering.</p>

The talks were adjourned  about 1230 last night, after 13 hours. The most difficult  points were details of how to implement the cease-fire and to  disengage forces on the ground.    According to HINA, all the participants were optimistic, and  the Russian special envoy, Vitaliy Churkin, described the  situation as favorable for reaching an agreement. The American  ambassador stated that the countries involved in the talks  firmly support Croatian integrity, but the problem must be  solved by peaceful means. The leader of the Croatian  delegation, Hrvoje Sarinic, said that the fact that the talks  would resume next Tuesday spoke for itself. He added that he  was optimistic about reaching a solution next week.</p>

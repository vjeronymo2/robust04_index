According to participants in the meeting,  Herzog received 34 votes in favour in the secret ballot. One  member of the executive voted against and one abstained. The  CSU [Christian Social Union] leadership had already expressed  support for Herzog last weekend. [passage omitted]    FDP leader Klaus Kinkel said in an interview with `BILD AM  SONNTAG' newspaper that only the CDU and CSU bodies had  nominated their candidate. Roman Herzog was a respected man,  but for the FDP the situation had not changed. "Our candidate is  Hildegard Hamm- Bruecher." [passage omitted]    Chancellor Kohl told journalists after the meeting the CDU  executive was convinced that Herzog was the right man for this  important office in such a difficult time of transition in the  fatherland. [passage omitted]    Herzog said he had told the CDU executive that he was  willing  to be nominated. The result of the secret ballot had greatly  encouraged him. He would now have to wait for the joint  proposal of the sister parties (CDU and CSU) before he accepted  the nomination.</p>

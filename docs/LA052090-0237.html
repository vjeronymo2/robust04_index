			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CORRECTION  </P> <P> A question in the May 6 "Condo Q&amp;A" column asked whether unincorporated  community associations are exempt from the California law on reserve funding.  The headline, "State Law Requires Establishing Reserve," was incorrect.  </P> <P> State law does not specifically require that the association set aside reserve  funds. However, there have been lawsuits in California as well as other states  resulting in judgments against boards of directors that failed to maintain  adequate reserve funds.  </P> <P> California law requires that a reserve analysis be prepared by the association.  All community associations, large and small, incorporated and unincorporated,  must comply. Full disclosure as to the method of funding for repairs and  replacement of the major components of the association's property must be  provided to the association's members and prospective buyers.  </P> <P> Board members must serve in the best interests of the association and make  sound business decisions regarding reserve funding. Those who fail to do so may  be held accountable if the association is faced with financial hardship  resulting from poor financial planning.  </P></p>

			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Ladbroke surge continues The week's phenomenal run by Ladbroke continued apace yesterday, the shares gaining further support in the wake of the announcement that Mr Cyril Stein, the retiring chairman, would not be taking up his non-executive position on the board. Leisure analysts said that while the surprise news strengthened the chances of the dividend being cut, a move always strongly resisted by Mr Stein, it augured well for the company's attempts to reduce its debts. As well as giving the new management a freer rein, it is also expected to hurry the appointment of other non-executive directors. There were also reports that the company would join forces with media group MAI to mount a bid for the National Lottery. Ladbroke shares jumped 14 to 194p in another day's hefty turnover of 11m. The stock, which has been among a number of brokers and pundits tips of the year for 1994, has now risen nearly 20 per cent in the past four days. Mr Mark Finnie at NatWest Securities, a long-time Ladbroke supporter, said: 'Clearly the market has had its concerns over Mr Stein's potential new role. We do anticipate however that this announcement signals the beginning of a more positive news flow from the company, and we expect further outperformance.'</p>

			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / A tune-up for City trades: The London Stock Exchange is gearing up for another Big Bang The London stock market is on the verge of its next Big Bang. Five and a half years after reforms were introduced to reshape share trading in the City, the Stock Exchange's board will today consider a further overhaul of its markets. At stake is not only whether the UK's domestic stock market can be made to work more efficiently for all its users, but whether London can consolidate its position as the leading centre for international share trading in Europe. Mr Peter Rawlins, an iconoclastic 41-year-old accountant brought in as chief executive two and a half years ago to implement the next phase of reform, is clear about the need for sweeping changes. 'Without them, the exchange will run the same risk as in the years before Big Bang,' he warned an audience of pension fund investment managers recently. 'It will be trapped by its own history.' The years since Big Bang have not been easy for the London securities industry. While the level of trading on the stock market soared after 1986, the crash of 1987 brought the City back to earth with a bump. Since then, the level of trading has fluctuated, making it difficult for brokers and market-makers to reap sustained profits. With this underlying problem - in part caused by continued overcapacity in the London market - the stock market which emerged after Big Bang has looked anything but settled. The UK's domestic market, and the international share market in London - each of which trades roughly the same value of shares - face different challenges. The domestic market is beset by three distinct difficulties. First, market - makers, the traders who provide the backbone of the London market, have been unable to make a decent return (most aim for 20-25 per cent) on the Pounds 3.5bn of capital which collectively they commit to support share trading in the City. The willingness of these firms to quote prices at which they will buy or sell shares - and to put up their own capital to back that commitment - is what distinguishes London from most other leading stock markets. The arrangement, modelled on Nasdaq, the US over-the-counter share market, offers investors the chance of dealing at any time and in large amounts. In stock market jargon, that makes London a highly liquid market. Market-makers warn that if they cannot make a decent profit they will stop offering this service. Large investors such as pension funds and insurance companies are almost universal in their support for the current system of market-making and want to see it strengthened. 'If we don't go down this road, there is a danger of the business going off-market,' says Mr Angus Matheson, chairman of the investment committee of the National Association of Pension Funds. 'That would lead to fragmentation.' Extra support for market-makers is to come later this year in the form of a change to the disclosure rules in the UK market. Market-makers will no longer be required to publish details of all their deals within 90 minutes. This greater degree of secrecy should make it easier for them to make a profit, since their competitors will not know the prices at which they are dealing. Institutional shareholders accept the change - even though it means they will have less information on which to judge whether they are getting the best price for shares. One said: 'I can't think of any other business in which wholesalers have to say what they have bought and how much they paid for it.' The second problem for the domestic stock market has been that share trading in London is concentrated on only about 250 companies. For the rest, which trade infrequently, the market-making system does not work. Spreads (the difference between prices at which shares are bought or sold) have widened steadily, and now stand at about 10 per cent for many listed companies. This discourages buying, and has caused the market in some companies' shares to stagnate. Third, private investors have become the poor relations in a stock market which was designed mainly for institutional investors. They have to pay a spread to market-makers - even though they rely less on the service they provide - thus adding unnecessarily to the cost of their dealing. Together, these pressures have contributed to the exchange's greatest worry: the fear that trading will begin to seep away, moving on to other trading systems off-exchange. It would be unable to legislate against such a move and has no monopoly on stock market trading. Also, the prices quoted by market-makers - the single most important facet of the market - are publicly available, and so could easily be used as a basis for transacting business off-exchange. For the moment, fragmentation remains just a fear. 'We've talked about doing business off-market, but haven't felt the need yet,' the head of one of the largest market-making firms said. But, like others, he feels increasingly exasperated. 'The Stock Exchange keeps saying it no longer represents us, the big firms - that it's no longer a club. One day they will go too far.' Investors continue to back the exchange, though in some cases reluctantly. An attempt to develop a system on which institutions could do business directly with each other, bypassing the market, flopped in the early 1980s. Similar systems are currently being promoted. Instinet, an electronic marketplace run by Reuters, the UK information group, boasts about 10 per cent of the turnover in US shares, and has begun a push into the European market. Some institutions claim that the exchange fails to consider their interests. 'The Stock Exchange still thinks it always knows best,' said Mr Barry Southcote, managing director of marketable securities at CIN, the manager of the coal industry pension fund. While the UK's domestic stock market has struggled, international share trading has been one of London's successes in recent years. A telephone market for international shares had already existed in London, but operated without any of the services that an official stock exchange provides. In the mid-1980s the exchange launched Seaq International, a price display system on which dealers could quote prices at which they would buy or sell foreign stocks. The market supported by this system has forged ahead: 95 per cent of European stocks bought or sold outside their home markets now change hands in London. This surging international share market could now be under threat. As other European centres push through reforms to their own stock markets and cut taxes on securities trading (an important reason for the migration of share trading to London), London's dominant position is no longer assured. The proportion of trading in German shares in London, for instance, declined last year - although London's overall market share rose. Mr Rudiger von Rosen, executive vice-president of the German Federation of Stock Exchanges, spelled out the determination to win trading in German shares back from London. 'Our first priority is to offer a market for D-Mark products which in terms of cost and efficiency is the best available,' he said. The exchange's response to both the domestic and the international challenge has so far failed to set the City alight. After two and a half years, Mr Rawlins has succeeded in slashing the exchange's cost base (staff numbers have fallen from about 3,000 to fewer than 2,000). But exchange users are still waiting for the long-term reforms which would put London's domestic and international stock markets on a firmer footing. 'There is a dissatisfaction with the level of urgency with which the exchange has gone about things,' said Mr Charles Nunnelly, chairman of the Institutional Fund Managers Association, a trade association of big investors. After today's board meeting, the pace of change may accelerate. Though much of the detail of the proposals being put to the board has been kept under wraps, the exchange's strategy is clear: to create distinct market systems serving both its main institutional investors and its private investors. That way, it hopes, it would please all its users all the time, and guarantee that the maximum amount of business continues to pass through the official Stock Exchange. The wholesale market would operate on minimum levels of regulation and disclosure, and would bring together the markets for UK and international shares on a single system, aimed at big internationally minded investors. Finding a way of linking the retail and wholesale share markets has caused much of the delay. Under the exchange's plans, small orders to buy and sell shares would be fed into a central computer, where trades would be carried out automatically. All investors would thus be assured that they were getting the best price. For instance, private investors would be able to specify prices at which they wanted to buy or sell shares (known as 'limit orders'). Then, if a large wholesale order was carried out at a better price, the limit orders would be completed automatically - much as happens at the New York Stock Exchange. Carrying through this strategy is the hard part. It will involve substantial spending, as the exchange finally scraps its many, varied systems and creates a single technological base on which to run its markets. Securities houses fear this will add substantially to their costs - on top of the spending already related to the development of London's planned paperless settlement system, Taurus. The exchange claims that any additional spending will be more than covered by cost savings. Convincing the exchange's users to make the necessary investment will be Mr Rawlins's hardest task. After the constant delays that have beset the Taurus project, confidence in the City in the exchange's ability to push through technological developments is not high. Without investment, though, London's leading position among European stock markets could come under threat. Revamping the Stock Exchange is likely to be a necessary cost of staying ahead.</p>

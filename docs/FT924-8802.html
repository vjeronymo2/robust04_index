			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / International Company News: Reliance advances 119% at midway as sales surge RELIANCE Industries, the fast-growing Indian chemicals and textiles conglomerate, yesterday reported a 119 per cent rise in net profits to Rs1.82bn (Dollars 64m), for the six months to September, from Rs831m a year earlier, due to a sharp increase in sales and a substantial increase in earnings from financial investments. Reliance, which this year became the first Indian company to raise equity in international markets through the issue of global depository receipts, reported a 26 per cent advance in sales to Rs13.48bn, excluding inter-group transactions, from Rs10.66bn. Profits from financial transactions were Rs522m, compared with none in the same period last year. Gross profits were Rs3.09bn, an increase of 73 per cent over the previous Rs1.79bn. Reliance expects further growth in profits in the second half of the year, as long as the government presses ahead with the deregulation of the petrochemicals industry. The group said it was suffering from the fact that the government, which is in the middle of economic reform, had cut subsidies on certain chemical feedstocks, thereby raising Reliance's input prices. But it had not yet liberalised imports of these products - depriving Reliance of access to cheaper imported feedstocks. Also, the Indian industry was suffering from 'large-scale dumping' and 'severe unfair competition' from foreign chemicals producers who were selling their products in India. However, Reliance expects the government to act soon on both these problems. The company is raising funds on the Bombay stock market for two subsidiaries which will make plastics in partnership with Itochu, the Japanese trading company.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow June 16 TASS -- Russia has abolished air  communications with its break-away southern republic of  Chechnya. The Russian Ministry of Transport has sent a message  to Groznyy that it suspends all flights from Russian airports to  Chechnya as well as those from the Chechen capital to any  airport of Russia, Shirvani Pashayev, an aide of the Chechen  information minister, told ITAR- TASS by telephone on Thursday.    Pashayev said that the flights were suspended under a  pretext  that Chechnya gives no guarantees of safety in the air space  over Groznyy.</p>

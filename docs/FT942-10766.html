			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Setback for Lipton over British Land stake The struggle by Mr Stuart Lipton, chief executive of Stanhope, to block a deal in which British Land acquired a 29.9 per cent share of Stanhope has suffered a setback in the High Court. Mr Justice Vinelott made an order striking out proceedings by Mr Lipton's private company against British Land and the Bank of Nova Scotia. Mr Lipton had claimed pre-emption rights over the 29.9 per cent stake which British Land acquired from the Bank of Nova Scotia in March. The judge made his decision on the grounds that the Lipton Group's claim disclosed 'no cause of action'. He refused leave to appeal and costs were awarded to the defendants. Mr Lipton has been anxious to overturn British Land's acquisition of the stake, which is seen as a step to gain control of Stanhope's half-share in Broadgate, the City offices. Mr Lipton says he has the right of first refusal to buy the stake, originally owned by Olympia &amp; York, then pledged to the Bank of Nova Scotia. Mr Lipton was unavailable for comment, although he is understood to be intent on pursuing his claim further.</p>

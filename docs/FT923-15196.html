			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Greene King extends bid for Morland GREENE KING, the East Anglia-based brewer, said yesterday that it had gained control of 46.43 per cent of Morland, the Thames Valley brewer, and that it was extending its offer until July 10. The Bury St. Edmunds brewer launched its Pounds 101m bid for Morland seven weeks ago after buying a 28.5 per cent stake and receiving pledges for a further 14.9 per cent from the Whitbread Investment Company. Mr Jasper Clutterbuck, Morland's chief executive, said yesterday that the further 3 per cent acceptances so far gained by Greene King showed that Morland's shareholders 'continue to treat the bid with disdain.' He added: 'Greene King should recognise the reality of the situation and withdraw its offer immediately.' However, Mr Simon Redman, Greene King's chairman, said he was pleased with support so far from private and institutional shareholders. 'Many shareholders are waiting until they know that all the relevant arguments and facts have emerged before deciding whether to accept our offer.' If the Takeover Panel permits, Greene King's results for the year ended May 3, which will include an asset revaluation, will be published on July 9 - 24 hours before the next closing date for the offer.</p>

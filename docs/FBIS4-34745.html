			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 21 Jun (PL) -- Christine Stewart, Canadian  minister of state for Latin America and Africa, said here today  that she enjoyed a very interesting conversation with President  Fidel Castro, with whom she analyzed the development of  bilateral relations.    The Canadian official, who ended her working tour of Havana  this Tuesday, said during a news conference that she met with  the Cuban statesman last night and talked about the island's  current economic difficulties as well as Canada's domestic  problems.    It was "a very interesting, pleasant conversation with a man  who has a warm personality, who is obviously interested in the  world around him, who has a great love for his country, and who,  in my opinion, only wants the best for his fatherland," the  minister of state asserted.    The objective of Stewart's visit was to increase relations  and further Canadian investments. She is the highest ranking  official from Ottawa to visit the Caribbean country in 18 years,  since former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau's trip to Havana in  1976.    Regarding her meetings with Fidel Castro and other top local  officials, Stewart emphasized that Canada has no intention of  dictating solutions to Cuban problems and only wants an  opportunity to exchange experiences with the hope that both  parties can learn from each other. "We want to make sure that  Cubans know they can count on our experiences."    Stewart said Fidel Castro appreciated Ottawa's decision to  officially renew economic aid to the island, and they both  agreed that "this is only the beginning of new ways that Canada  can help Cuba."    Aid was suspended in 1978 because Cuba gave military  assistance to Angola when it was attacked by South Africa. That  decision, however, did not negatively affect the development of  their ties, especially in the commercial and tourism sectors.    Stewart announced a modest package of $360,000 in food for  children and pregnant women this year and another $700,000 for  1995. She also promised that, upon her return, she would study  ways to better assist the Caribbean island.    On another topic, the Canadian minister of state emphasized  Canada's growing interest in conducting business with Cuba,  especially in establishing mixed enterprises that will yield  mutual benefits. She also highlighted the willingness of  authorities in Ottawa to encourage the investment of Canadian  capital in Cuba.</p>

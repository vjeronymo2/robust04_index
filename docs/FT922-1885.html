			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / Potential bidder found for London Riverbus A POTENTIAL bidder for London Riverbus, the loss-making Thames service, emerged yesterday with plans to develop a commuter network into the capital using a fleet of 34 vessels. The potential bid depends on cutting Riverbus's overheads by operating smaller, 12-seat river taxis in off-peak periods. White Horse Ferries, a Swindon-based company, said it was discussing a takeover of Riverbus with the administrators of Olympia &amp; York, the failed developer of Canary Wharf. O&amp;Y rescued Riverbus from collapse three years ago when it led a consortium of property developers that injected Pounds 2.5m to underwrite services between Chelsea and Greenwich. Riverbus has been operated by managers seconded from P&amp;O, the shipping company, which owns the service in partnership with O&amp;Y. White Horse plans to operate 26 12-seater river taxis, which would feed passengers to high-speed ferries operating from London to Gravesend and Tilbury. Work on the prototype river taxi is nearing completion at the Griffon shipyard in Southampton. The yard will also build eight long-haul craft expected to carry up to 120 passengers. River trials for the so-called Thames Fast Ferries are due to start in July with the inaugural service starting in August. Riverbus confirmed that White Horse had made an approach, but added: 'We are considering a number of options for the future, not least at ministerial level.' Both companies hope to exploit plans to relocate civil servants in Docklands by winning government backing for Thames transport services. White Horse says that even if it fails to win control of Riverbus it will continue with its Pounds 6m scheme to operate new river services into London. The company is in talks with the City of London Corporation to build a pontoon at Blackfriars to act as a hub for journeys to other parts of the city. According to Mr Lay, the French government has also shown an interest in the White Horse vessels. He says there is scope for similar services on the Seine in Paris.</p>

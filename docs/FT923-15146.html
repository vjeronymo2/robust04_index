			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Survey of Privatisation in Eastern Europe (1): Not as easy as it looks - The fall of communist regimes in eastern Europe has opened the way for largescale privatisation programmes and the promise of greater prosperity. That is the theory. The practice is more tangled DEPRIVATION of property rights was at the heart of communism's destruction of civil society. So the fall of communist regimes throughout eastern Europe (and much of Asia) has opened the way for privatisation of state-owned enterprises and assets on an unprecedented scale. With it has come the promise of greater prosperity but above all the chance of creating a property-owning middle class to underpin democracy and guarantee the irreversibility of the escape from totalitarianism. At least, that is the theory. The practice is a much more tangled tale. The earliest attempts at privatisation soon revealed the extent of the Stalinist system's perverse success in destroying the institutions, habits and above all the mental processes required for a private enterprise, market system to function. With the exception of Czechoslovakia, and to a lesser extent the other east and central European countries 'liberated' by the Red Army in 1944-45, this was a poor and relatively underdeveloped part of Europe before the Second World War. Capitalism existed mostly at a rather primitive and backward level. But at least the post-war Soviet satellites only endured 45 years of Soviet control. Vestiges of private enterprise and memories of markets remained. However, once inside the former Soviet borders one enters a zone where even the memory of capitalism had been virtually eclipsed. Where capitalism survived it was largely as a criminal sub-culture of fixers with vast scope for mafia-like corruption arising from the party nomenklatura system which made party, factory and farm bosses little Tsars. Judged against this background the privatisation process has made extraordinary strides. But the first pilot scheme largely funded by the UK's Know-How Fund to privatise selected Polish companies in 1990 showed the differences between privatising in a capitalist environment and attempting a similar process in a socialist desert. The pioneers found this meant operating without an established legal framework, without functioning banks or stock exchanges - let alone any of the myriad specialised services such as security printing or financial advertising. Since those early days fledgling stock exchanges and other institutions have been formed and much has been done to create a legal framework, usually closely based on European Community standards, covering crucial areas such as property rights, bankruptcy procedures and banking. At the same time, the vexed question of profit repatriation has been greatly simplified in the three historically most advanced countries, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland, whose currencies are now internally convertible. Russia is also about to make the rouble internally convertible as part of its drive to attract foreign equity investment. The eventual extent of the rouble zone remains unclear as the Baltic states, Ukraine and other republics are preparing to issue their own currencies. Uncertainty shrouds the future of Czechoslovakia, with all indicators pointing to the split up of the federal republic into two separate states with separate currencies and privatisation plans. Progress with privatisation and the accompanying legal, institutional and cultural changes diminishes as one moves further south and east. Recent World Bank funding for Romania and Bulgaria reflects awareness of the need to support the privatisation process in the Balkans. Civil war in former Yugoslavia is destroying the economic as well as political and social fabric, leaving only Slovenia to press on with privatisation and the cultivation of its links with Austria and Italy. One of the main benefits from the privatisation process in eastern Europe has been the way practical needs have identified the priority areas where changes are needed to make not only privatisation but economic reform work. The leading accounting firms, international legal practices and banks have established offices, often with large staffs, in the cities. Hundreds of trade sales of state-owned enterprises (SOE) to foreign multinationals have created a fast-growing core of often highly visible privatised companies which are both competitors and role models for state-owned enterprises still awaiting nationalisation. Cherry picking by the multinationals has underlined one fact - that relatively few SOEs are really attractive takeover propositions and that privatisation of the rest is likely to get more difficult as time goes on. Hence the need for ingenious and unconventional mass privatisation programmes designed to help create capitalism without capital. Poland was the pioneer in this. But three changes of government, the difficulty of retaining experienced staff in an over-bureaucratised privatisation structure, as well as the blocking powers of an unholy alliance between communist-era managers and Solidarity-dominated workers councils, have slowed down the pace. Political developments in Czechoslovakia threaten to distract attention, at least in the short term, from a coupon mass privatisation programme, which, if successful, could well become a model throughout the region, including Russia. The political victory scored by Mr Vaclav Klaus, the Czech leader, in last month's elections, has underlined the political significance of the privatisation programme. He insisted that the first stage of the coupon scheme should be implemented before the elections. This ensured that 8.5m voters, both Czechs and Slovaks, went to the polls as owners of vouchers enabling them to acquire shares in 1,700 SOEs on offer in the biggest and quickest privatisation sale ever seen. Dismantling the federal structure will ensure that privatisation in the Czech lands at least will be pursued with renewed vigour. The outlook for privatisation in a sovereign Slovakia is more problematical. Slovakia is not the only country whose over-sized, technologically obsolescent factories are virtually unsellable. There is growing awareness that a greater effort is required to restructure and improve the management of those SOEs which cannot be privatised in the short term but which cannot be allowed to collapse for social and political reasons. At both government and enterprise level original assumptions about the value of these assets have been reduced. One management consultant always introduces his lectures on how to privatise against the background of a poster reading 'an asset is worth what somebody will pay for it and nothing else'. One consequence is that governments, or the various national privatisation agencies set up by them, have changed their priorities. Privatisation, especially that involving purchase by foreign investors, is no longer seen primarily as a means of raising hard currency to bolster inadequate budget revenues, although that remains an important consideration. What is looked for is the best commitment to future investment in restructuring and the biggest transfers of technology, management and marketing skills. The best deals are those which guarantee both the highest number of secure jobs and the fastest integration of the newly-privatised enterprise into the global economy as a hard currency earning asset. Until now trade sales of the family silver to foreign companies, and auction sales, or restitution to former owners, of small scale assets such as shops, restaurants and houses have been the most successful forms of privatisation. But with many of the best assets privatised, especially in Hungary and Czechoslovakia, and domestic savings low or non-existent, the future will see greater attention paid to mass privatisation. Nevertheless, governments will still have to improve the economic performance, or close down, the industrial monuments to a failed system which can be neither privatised nor revamped.</p>

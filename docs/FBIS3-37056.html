Speaking on Friday, he told the leaders of West Siberian  trade unions, which threaten a strike over pay delays, to  consider the workers' demands when developing a new social and  economic policy. At the same time, Chernomyrdin made it clear he  would not bow to the threat of strikes and would take "unpopular  measures" if need be.    He called for defaults to be negotiated between consumers,  producers and the unions by way of agreements on prices, tariffs  and wages, saying the government had no money to oblige their  demands.    Leader of the trade unions federation of the Kuznetsk  coal-mining region Anatoliy Chekis said he was dissatisfied with  the outcome of talks with the prime minister who had failed to  give a coherent answer to the questions in hand.    However, he suggested Chernomyrdin may not have been  informed  "about our demands though we sent them before." If wages are  not paid in time, "there will be a social explosion," he said.    Employment Minister Gennadiy Melikyan and union activists  are  to hold more talks on Saturday.</p>

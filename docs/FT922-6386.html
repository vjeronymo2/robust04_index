			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / Government to sell off part of property agency THE government yesterday announced plans to sell off the Property Services Agency's projects division, one of Britain's biggest construction organisations. The environment department said the division, which designs and constructs buildings for government bodies, had attracted interest from 60 companies including some international groups. The sale terms will be advertised next week in the UK and on the Continent in the Financial Times. Several large quoted British construction and engineering groups have previously expressed an interest in buying all or part of the division, which has 2,000 employees. They are thought to include Tarmac, Trafalgar House, Taylor Woodrow and BICC. The sale comes when the UK construction industry is at a low ebb and many companies in the sector are strapped for cash. The agency builds offices, courts, prisons, laboratories, civil and military airports and other installations. Last year it had a turnover of Pounds 190m. Most government construction contracts for the past two years have been subject to competitive tender. The agency, with its experience of public-sector building requirements and its strong links to government departments, has remained in a strong position and has continued to win a large share of the work. Companies buying the business will be expected to give commercial guarantees for work completed or being undertaken by the PSA. This could restrict what bidders are willing to pay. The winner may also have to fund substantial redundancy payments as it merges the division with its own contracting businesses. As a result, the government is unlikely to raise much money from the sale. One large publicly quoted contractor said yesterday that it regarded the risks as too great and it would not bid. Mr John Redwood, environment minister, said: 'While I would prefer to sell the projects division as a single entity, it is open to prospective purchasers to indicate their interest in part purchases. He called for preliminary bids by June 26 and final offers about four weeks later. The environment department has appointed Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte, the accountancy firm, to advise on the sale.</p>

			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Finance And The Family: O&amp;Y and the small investor WHEN THE builders of as confident a landmark as the Canary Wharf tower ask for protection from their creditors, it can only be expected to dent investors' confidence. Yesterday, markets showed an understandable reaction to the news of O&amp;Y's difficulties. The share prices of banks exposed to O&amp;Y, and other property companies, dipped sharply. But it remains unclear that what could be the biggest liquidation in corporate history will have any severe impact on private investors. For a start, O&amp;Y is a privately owned company, so no pooled funds will have direct exposure to it - although losses may be borne via holdings in banks which stand to lose out. What of the impact on the property market? It is difficult to claim that this is good news for property, but private investors' exposure to it via collective funds has declined drastically in recent years. According to Combined Actuarial Performance Services, mixed collective funds had an average holding of only 4 per cent in property at the end of 1991. For pension funds this figure is only 2 per cent, down from 10 per cent ten years earlier. However, bigger pension funds, defined by CAPS as having a market value of more than Pounds 500m, have a larger proportion in property - around 8 per cent. It seems unlikely that there is much misery in store for investors on this front. There are a number of ways in which O&amp;Y's difficulties could be felt in investors' pockets. The most direct would be tax shelter investments which take advantage of 100 per cent tax reliefs available on enterprise zone property. Docklands is no longer an enterprise zone, but it will be possible to benefit from the tax reliefs for another two years. This is usually done using enterprise zone 'trusts' or syndicated deals where the ownership of a large block is shared between a large number of investors. O&amp;Y itself tried to launch the biggest EZT ever in February, to fund a building in Cabot Square, Canary Wharf. It was withdrawn in March, and demand for it had already been seriously dented by O&amp;Y's financial difficulties. With hindsight, the demise of the deal, on which the only guarantee for rent came from O&amp;Y itself, will not be deeply lamented - even though US bank Morgan Guaranty guaranteed that there would be no loss in capital value over ten years. Other EZT deals in Docklands are also looking rather sticky. CET7, the last EZT deal of 1991-92, failed to reach its full subscription target, and the final structure of the deal for investors is still not clear. Against this background, O&amp;Y's call for help might almost be an advantage, as it removes uncertainty, and might even mean that eventually some Canary Wharf buildings will be available for EZT deals. Analysts also seem to feel that so much bad news about O&amp;Y was already in Docklands rent prices that an orderly process of disentangling the company's debts is now actually one of the best possible outcomes. Rents have fallen so low that it is now difficult to claim that there is a 'false market' in Docklands property. It cannot be good news that the world's largest property developer is in this kind of trouble, but at the moment it seems unlikely that small investors will feel many of the shockwaves.</p>

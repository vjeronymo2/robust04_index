			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Circulation of Body Shop article restricted The US magazine due to publish a critical article on Body Shop International next week will not distribute copies in any Commonwealth country in an attempt to avoid British libel laws. Speculation about the contents of an article in Business Ethics, the Minneapolis-based magazine, and articles expected to be printed in other publications has helped trigger controversy around Body Shop over the last few days. Business Ethics said yesterday that it was going ahead with its plans to carry the article, written by Mr Jon Entine, a US journalist, on Thursday. It has refused requests from Body Shop, as well as many journalists and other organisations, to see copies of the article before publication. However, it is believed to have decided to prevent circulation in any of the countries of the Commonwealth after seeking legal advice. The US constitution prevents any attempt to obtain an injunction to forbid publication of the article in advance. The magazine, with a distribution of about 14,000, published a highly positive piece on Ms Anita Roddick and the Body Shop two years ago. It says that next week's article 'does raise questions about the Body Shop's policies and practices' but does so 'in a fair and balanced way' with supporting documentation. Body Shop's shares closed down 3p at 218p yesterday. They were 242p on Thursday a week ago before details about the articles began to emerge.</p>

			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Zeneca gains extended Pharmaceuticals group Zeneca gained 16 1/2 to 811 1/2 p in response to Thursday's interim figures and continuing bid speculation. However, profit takers moved into the other sector bid target, Wellcome, and the shares fell 7 1/2 to 678p. Glaxo was dragged down as US investors sold the stock on enduring fears over the future performance of Zantac although a more positive stance from Goldman Sachs saw the shares rally from the lows to close 3 off at 600p. And after the UK market closed a sizeable US order suggested to some traders that the New York mood might be softening. Positive comment following the interim results prompted Kleinwort Benson shares to improve 25 to 522p. However NatWest Securities argued that the merchant bank would have difficulty repeating the interim performance in the second half of the year and recommended a switch into SG Warburg, which rose 20 to 783p. In general, the enthusiasm spilled over into the sector and rival Schroders jumped 45 to 1313p. Electricity generators performed strongly in the wake of PowerGen's recent share buy back. PowerGen improved 14 to 566p while National Power and Scottish rose 12 to 474p and 10 to 390p respectively. Newspaper groups were under pressure as NatWest Securities presented a negative attitude. The house said: 'Whether or not the Daily Express, Daily Mail or Mirror cut cover prices, they will continue to suffer significant costs which will impact their earnings growth prospects, balance sheet valuations and ability to drive cross-media strategic moves.' Daily Mail Group Trust fell 12 to 1023p in the A's, Mirror Group slipped 8 to 128p and United Newspapers shed 9 to 529p. There was general profit-taking in two of the engineering companies that reported good interim figures this week. TI Group closed 12 down at 400p with additional selling attributed to 'reduce' advice from NatWest Securities. Glynwed International relinquished 9 to 381p. Its two brokers, SG Warburg and Albert E. Sharp, are now predicting full year figures of Pounds 64m and Pounds 66m respectively. Bid-speculation returned to manufacturer Hazlewood Foods, lifting the shares 9 to 145p. Once again the market talk centred on Unigate as the likely aggressor. There was a suggestion that Unigate would finance such a bid through the sale of its 34 per cent stake in Dutch food company Nutricia. However, an analyst dismissing the rumour said: 'This has been around before and I very much doubt it is going to happen now.' There was also talk of board changes at Hazlewood. Shares in Unigate jumped 15 to 380p. Unilever and Perkins Foods continued to benefit from a recommendation by Strauss Turnbull made earlier this week. The former finished 18 up at 1067p, while the latter added 9 to 75p. Nervous trading ahead of first quarter figures, combined with light profit-taking, left airline British Airways a penny easier at 429p. The range of analysts' forecasts is between Pounds 85m and Pounds 95m for the quarter. A squeeze in airports group BAA sent the shares climbing 12 to 972p. A one-for-one share split agreed at the company's annual meeting last month is to take place on Monday. The strong rise in Tomkins continued as Goldman Sachs reiterated its buy recommendation. The shares gained 6 to 240p, as 9.1m shares were dealt, making it the day's most heavily traded stock. Goldman's move followed a favourable company presentation at the investment bank on Thursday evening. Mr Gavin Launder at Goldman said the stock did not deserve its discount rating given the current growth in the old Tomkins business and recovery prospects for RHM (its foods subsidiary). A confident annual meeting and a buy recommendation from Robert Fleming boosted Chubb Security. The shares hardened 4 to 334p. Services group Inchcape gained 15 to 491p, in trade of 5.3m, after Robert Fleming reiterated its buy recommendation. The broker cited the fall in the value of the yen as the main reason why the shares were a good buy. Inchcape is a big trader of Japanese cars. A bearish note from investment house Credit Lyonnais sent chemicals Group BOC down 11 to 754p ahead of next week's third quarter figures. Mr Colin Isaac, analyst at Credit Lyonnais, said that 'cyclical recovery would not be as strong as on previous occasions' and BOC had outperformed the market. Hewetson climbed 14 to 82p. Mr Scott Faulton, analyst at Smith New Court, suggested that the building materials sector was performing well due to good market sentiment. Positive notes from NatWest Securities pushed BPB, the building products group, and RMC, 12 to 347p and 14 to 1008p respectively. Paper and packaging group Bowater gained 9 to 470p on speculation that Hanson might be interested in buying the company. Volume in the US traded American Depositary Receipts on Thursday night had been significantly higher than normal daily turnover. Hanson fell 1 1/2 to 262 1/2 p.</p>

			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / Books: Family epic - Poetry HISTORY: THE HOME MOVIE by Craig Raine Penguin, Pounds 9.99 paperback, Pounds 18 hdbk In this volume Craig Raine transforms within his three-line stanzas scenes of modern life - at its most public as well as its most private  - which may at first sight seem among the most grittily anti-poetic material of the 20th century. In what his publishers describe as 'an epic history of Europe from 1905 to 1984,' milestones of history running through geography from Moscow to Oxford by way of Berlin, mark the converging relationships between the families of two poets - the Russian Pasternaks and the English Raines. Their private - often very private - histories are conveyed in scenes dramatised - or should I say 'turned into home movies' - at points where these overlap with historic events; the first world war, the post-war era, the Russian Revolution, the second world war. Craig Raine seems to have a setter's instinct for discovering points at which the public events in public lives strike home into the private lives of contemporaries and become elements in a mythology of modern history. These occasions of public historic significance are brilliantly selected by Raine and they retain the immediacy - indeed the intimacy - of the moment. Here is the artist Leonid Pasternak, father of the poet Boris Pasternak, drawing Lenin as Lenin addresses a meeting - 1919 The Comintern, Moscow: 'How Leonid's pencil hovers and settles and hovers again, until slowly the head, seeps out of the paper bearded, bald as an acorn, chin strained out like a sprinter, Touching, then taking off until VI Lenin is there and there on the page, brass-rubbed rather than drawn. At first, the accumulation of such precisely drawn observations may seem too crammed with facts, too grittily resistant to any escape into the purely poetic. But reading on, one realises that these are the details of a mosaic, the cumulative effect of which adds up to a large scale picture of the two families concerned - and of other characters - against the geographical and historical background of Europe in this century. An epic is supposed to have a hero but the chief character here, Eliot Raine, a doctor, interesting as he is, and masterly as is Raine's translation of his medical skills into his poetic terminology, scarcely strikes me as being on the heroic scale. Indeed a lesser, rather inexplicable character called Roniger, who makes an adventurous and largely disastrous journey from East to West and ends up dying in Oxford, seems to me to have more the makings of a hero than any of the Pasternaks or the Raines. The poem does not quite establish members of these two families as being on the epic scale. If Pasternak is accepted as such this is perhaps because literary history has already perceived him as such. Yet out of this highly personal material, Raine creates a fascinating world that I feel I will return to again and again.</p>

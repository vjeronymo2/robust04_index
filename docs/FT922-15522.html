			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / People: Economist's mind tuned to predictable disasters Geoffrey Dennis, the new director of international operations at the British Red Cross from today, had 'always had it at the back of the mind' that he wanted to work - at a relatively senior level  - for charity. An economist by training, Dennis, who is 40, joins from engineering consultants Travers Morgan, where he looked after the planning division of its environmental side. There, and with his previous employers Ewbank Preece, he has managed a series of projects in the developing world - spending a lot of time in Bang-ladesh, but also India and the Far East, particularly Indonesia. He says the fact that Travers was recently bought by Huntingdon, the engineering and environmental services group, had nothing to do with his decision to move to the charity - he had had interviews before he was aware of the Huntingdon offer, and adds that his area was anyway one of Travers' successes. His new responsibilities encompass disaster relief, 'still the highest priority' - for instance, tracing split Yugoslav families; and, a rel-atively new departure, up-front development work to help lessen the effect of predictable disasters, for example, providing hurricane shelters in Bangladesh. In a disaster-ridden 12 months, the British Red Cross last year spent Pounds 29.6m overseas. Attracted by the 'young and dynamic' senior management - headed by director general Mike Whitlam, 45, - Dennis says the pay cut he has taken is not as significant as it would have been a decade ago, as charities have increasingly woken up to the need to attract 'strong professional people'. He replaces David Wyatt who retires after seven years in the job.</p>

			<p><P> June 21, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MCDONNELL DOUGLAS PLANS UP TO 10,000 MORE LAYOFFS  </P> <P> McDonnell Douglas Corp., facing serious technical problems in its military  aircraft programs and financial difficulties in its commercial jetliner  business, said Wednesday that it will attempt to cut $700 million from its  annual operating costs -- a move that could lead to an estimated 10,000 layoffs  companywide.  </P> <P> Such cutbacks would come on top of the current plan to lay off 7,000 workers at  the Long Beach-based Douglas Aircraft unit, which is losing money and facing a  cash squeeze. The new round of layoffs covers all divisions of the company.  While the company did not specify the potential impact in Southern California,  the new layoffs here are likely to number in the thousands.  </P> <P> The company's crash effort to slash costs comes amid growing concern over the  financial health of St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas, the nation's largest  defense contractor and a major competitor in the commercial aircraft industry.  </P> <P> In a letter to employees entitled "The Hard Reality," company Chairman John  McDonnell said that the cost-cutting plan will be implemented by early August  and that there will be no severance payments or incentives for employees to  quit. He said the "layoffs are driven by ongoing unsatisfactory business  results."  </P> <P> The company is the second-largest aerospace employer in Southern California,  with an estimated 50,000 jobs here out of the company's total work force of  129,000. McDonnell has plants in Long Beach, Torrance, Huntington Beach and San  Diego.  </P> <P> Company spokesman Michael Burch said the Douglas Aircraft subsidiary would be  required to absorb additional work force cutbacks. "Certainly, Douglas would  get some credit for what it has already done to reduce employment, but it is  clear that Douglas will have to take more," he said.  </P> <P> In his letter, John McDonnell said the company is not considering a  restructuring or "the sale of component companies," apparently referring to  persistent rumors that the company will close Douglas Aircraft.  </P> <P> In addition to layoffs, the company intends to cut overtime, travel, new  hiring, the use of consultants and other support activities. However, potential  savings in these areas are considered to be minor compared to layoffs.  </P> <P> Aerospace analyst Howard Rubel of C. J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell, an  investment firm, called the cutbacks "another missile from John McDonnell," but  added that the radical step is necessary to improve the company's lackluster  financial performance. Rubel said that a successful cost-cutting effort could  lift McDonnell Douglas' productivity level to that of Boeing Co., when measured  on the basis of sales per employee.  </P> <P> "They are shucking their paternalistic ways," Rubel said. But the new  atmosphere is also deeply undercutting morale at the company. One scientist  said Wednesday, "The morale is about what you would expect -- not too high and  those who remain here are under that much more stress."  </P> <P> John Capellupo, deputy president at Douglas, issued a memo to workers this  week, saying, "I will demand that my management test you and your team's  discipline to the limit of their physical and emotional stamina -- but not  beyond reason." One C-17 worker complained, "Who does he think he is running,  the Marine Corps?"  </P> <P> The McDonnell letter did not specify how many workers will be forced out as a  result of the $700-million cost cutting effort, but the cost savings include  previously announced layoffs.  </P> <P> Information in the 1989 annual report indicates that at least 10,000 additional  workers would have to be let go to achieve the company's goal. Based upon  figures in the annual report, employees earned an average of about $38,000 each  last year. Thus, a 17,000-worker cut will save about $650 million annually and  another $50 million could be saved from non-wage cuts. The $700 million in  savings would represent between 4.5% and 5% of the company's operating costs.  </P> <P> Burch acknowledged that the outlook for McDonnell has turned more negative in  the past two weeks. On June 8, McDonnell disclosed that it expects to take a  charge against profits on the Navy A-12 attack jet, under development at its  McDonnell Aircraft unit in St. Louis.  </P> <P> In addition, McDonnell has significant cost overruns on its Navy T-45 trainer  jet program, which has been transferred from Douglas Aircraft in Long Beach to  the McDonnell Aircraft operation in St. Louis. The massive C-17 development  program is at its $4.9-billion ceiling, beyond which the company would have to  pay all costs.  </P> <P> The MD-80 commercial jetliner program is continuing to suffer from  manufacturing delays that last year resulted in forfeiture of $20 million in  penalties to customers. And the new MD-11 jetliner cannot be delivered to  customers until government certification is granted. The company hopes to  obtain certification by Oct. 31, but until then it must bear the heavy cost of  financing the aircraft's production.  </P> <P> The run of bad news at the company has dealt a sharp blow to McDonnell stock,  which closed Wednesday at $39.50 per share, up 87.5 cents. Wednesday's  announcement came after the market closed. Within the last year, the stock has  been as high as $79.625.  </P></p>

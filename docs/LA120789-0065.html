			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HINTS FROM HELOISE: CORNSTARCH AND BAKING SODA KEY TO HANDMADE CHRISTMAS  ORNAMENTS  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: I've misplaced my recipe for making cornstarch-and-baking-soda  ornaments, and, of course, now I need it. I know it was in your column some  time ago, but I hope you can print it again. Thanks for all your wonderful  help. -- MURRIEL, Kearny, N.J.  </P> <P> DEAR MURRIEL: I'd be glad to. They're easy to make, and handmade ornaments are  a great Christmas tradition to keep alive. You'll need:  </P> <P> HANDMADE CHRISTMAS ORNAMENTS  </P> <P> 1 cup cornstarch  </P> <P> 2 cups baking soda  </P> <P> 1 1/4 cups cold water  </P> <P> Mix cornstarch and baking soda in saucepan. Add water. Cook over medium heat,  stirring constantly, until mixture is consistency of wet mashed potatoes. Turn  out onto plate. Cover with damp cloth and let it cool.  </P> <P> When cool, knead until smooth. Seal in plastic bag and store in refrigerator  until ready to use.  </P> <P> Shape ornaments by hand or flatten dough and use cookie cutters to cut out  shapes. Insert wire hanger into soft dough. Then let ornaments dry overnight,  or heat them in 250-degree oven 15 minutes. If not completely dry, continue to  heat in 5-minute increments.  </P> <P> Dried pieces can be painted with water colors, poster paints, acrylic paints or  felt-tip pens. Finish ornaments with 1 coat or 2 coasts of clear nail polish or  varnish and they will last for years.  </P> <P> Enjoy your ornament making.  </P> <P>  -- HELOISE  </P> <P> DEAR READERS: So many of our readers have hints for healthier cooking, we  thought it would be nice to pass them along since many of us are trying to cut  calories, cholesterol, salt and fat. Including me.  </P> <P> Arlene of Colorado Springs, Colo., cooks chicken breasts in the oven in a  covered dish with a sodium-free broth. She says they are delicious and low in  calories.  </P> <P> Katie of Reno, Nev., has a great substitution for high-fat whipped topping.  Chill some evaporated skim milk well and then whip it. Add a dash of vanilla  extract or sugar substitute for flavor.  </P> <P> Kathy of Blanco, Tex., uses plain nonfat yogurt in place of sour cream on a  baked potato. I like to add garlic salt or herbs for a tasty treat.  </P> <P> The new sprinkle-on butter substitutes are fantastic on steamed vegetables,  mashed potatoes and to add butter flavor to homemade low-fat macaroni and  cheese.  </P> <P> When making baked goods like muffins or breads, add a half cup of oat bran.  This will give them a better texture and will increase fiber intake.  </P> <P>  -- HELOISE  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: When I have bought a sack of onions, I find it much easier to get  the whole job done at once: I chop all of the onions in a food processor, put  them in plastic, self-closing bags and place them in the freezer after  flattening the bags.  </P> <P> This allows me to break off whatever amount I need and eliminates all the tears  every time.  </P> <P>  -- STEPHANIE, St. Louis  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: A friend showed me how to make a chocolate fondue. I decided one  day I would prepare it as practice for a dinner party I was having later.  </P> <P> I did something wrong because the chocolate ended up hard and gritty. I have  since tried a couple more times and I still get the same results. Any idea why  the chocolate comes out like this?  </P> <P>  -- PATTY, New York  </P> <P> DEAR PATTY: If you're using the double-boiler method, don't let the water touch  the bottom of the pan because it will scorch the chocolate and make it hard and  gritty.  </P> <P> Using a saucepan that is too light and cooking the chocolate too fast could  also contribute to the problem.  </P> <P> The best way to cook chocolate for a fondue is to use a heavy saucepan over low  heat and stir it often. I like to use a pancake turner. That way you can really  scrape the whole pan in just a few moments.  </P> <P> Give this a try and let us know how it turns out.  </P> <P>  -- HELOISE  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: I had some very ripe bananas and I decided I would bake some  banana bread the following morning.  </P> <P> When I began the recipe I went to get the bananas and they were gone. My  husband had tossed them. So instead of throwing out the already-mixed  ingredients I thought I would add some canned peaches, since this was all I  had.  </P> <P> The bread turned out just fine and my family loved it. I am also going to  experiment with several other fruits.  </P> <P>  -- J. N., Provo, Utah  </P></p>

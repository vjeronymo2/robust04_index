			<p><P> January 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SLOAN FOUNDATION TO FUND STUDY ON U.S. COMPETITIVENESS  </P> <P> The Alfred P. Sloan Foundation will give nearly $3 million to five universities  to study the problems that U.S. companies have competing in the international  marketplace, the New York-based foundation was scheduled to announce today.  </P> <P> "Competitiveness is an issue that a lot of people are writing about," said  David J. Teece, head of UC Berkeley's Consortium on Competitiveness and  Cooperation, which will manage the $2.97-million grant.  </P> <P> "We're not doing as well as we could, as well as we have historically and as  well as the leading nations we trade with.  </P> <P> "The U.S. economy is in decline . . . and it's not necessary. If we want to set  a new course, we can."  </P> <P> Faculty from Berkeley, Stanford, Columbia, Harvard and MIT will participate,  representing a variety of disciplines, including economics, management and  engineering.  </P> <P> The study is unusual because it requires extensive cooperation from U.S.  industry, said Ralph E. Gomory, president of the Sloan Foundation. The chief  executives of five companies -- General Electric, General Motors, Hewlett  Packard, IBM and Xerox -- have guaranteed cooperation by their firms, he said.  </P> <P> During the 3-to-5-year study, the corporations will help the consortium decide  what issues to examine, will provide data and will give "a perspective from  people actually involved in competition on a global basis," Teece said.  </P> <P> "You can't deal with competitiveness in a quick and ad hoc fashion," Gomory  said. "Scholarship without contact with reality isn't very useful."  </P> <P> The grant is the Sloan Foundation's largest to a university in 25 years. The  private foundation is a major funding source for college and university  research in science, economics, engineering, public policy and management.  </P></p>

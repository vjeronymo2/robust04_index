			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / International Company News: Enso-Gutzeit to expand in east Germany ENSO-GUTZEIT, one of Finland's largest paper makers, yesterday announced plans to build a DM800m (Dollars 493m) recycling plant in the eastern German state of Saxony, the biggest single foreign investment so far in the region. In a move aimed at expanding into the German market, and later into eastern Europe, the group will use the green-field site primarily for recycling, and will target the product for the growing newspaper market in eastern Germany. Germany already accounts for 15 per cent of the group's net sales, which last year totalled FM10.2bn (Dollars 1.86bn). The plant, situated east of Leipzig, one of the fastest-growing industrial centres among the five new eastern states, will start operating in September 1994 with an initial workforce of 300 people. Mr Jukka Hamala, director of Enso, said the decision to locate in Saxony was prompted by the region's geographical proximity to southern Germany, the Czech Republic, and other countries in eastern Europe. 'We are in the middle of one of the fastest-growing markets in Europe,' he said, adding that the group had wanted to enter the recycling market for some time, but could not obtain enough capacity from the small Finnish market. Mr Kai Korkonen, managing director of Sachsen Papier Eilenburg, the company set up to run the plant, said it would have a production capacity of 280,000 tons a year. The government of Saxony, led by Mr Kurt Biedenkopf, had lobbied hard to attract Enso. 'We cut through the red tape, we resolved any outstanding problems over property rights, and we showed that planning permission could be done in six months,' he said. 'Western Germany could take a leaf out of our book. Saxony is determined to attract foreign investors and make the region a highly competitive market.' Mr Biedenkopf, an economist and one of the most dynamic prime ministers in the eastern German state, also said the investment by Enso could persuade other foreign investors to settle in Saxony, and create jobs. The unemployment rate in Saxony is 301,000, or 13 per cent of the labour force, although this does not take into account those on job creation and training schemes, and part-time work. Besides its geographical location, the government of Saxony attracted Enso by offering substantial subsidies. About 15 per cent of the construction costs for the plant have been covered by the state. In addition, Enso will receive generous tax concessions of up to 40 per cent for the first three years. These advantages 'will offset high labour costs and make it worthwhile for us to use Saxony as a stepping stone into other parts of this region in Europe,' said Mr Korkonen. Saxony, and particularly Leipzig, the state's second largest city, was one of the centres of the printing and newspaper industry before the second world war, and the core of eastern Germany's heavy industry under the former communists. It also has a skilled workforce and a westward-looking 4.8m population. As a result, Saxony now tops the list in foreign investors and privatisation sales undertaken by the Treuhand, the agency responsible for restructuring and selling off eastern Germany's industrial sector. Since late 1990, the Treuhand has secured investment commitments of more than DM42.7bn, and job guarantees in excess of 406,500. Foreign companies which bought from the Treuhand account for DM2.7bn of investments, and 24,100 guaranteed jobs. Daimler-Benz is increasingly optimistic that it will be able to boost 1994 sales after an expected decline in sales in 1993, AP-DJ reports from Stuttgart. Mr Gerhard Liener, chief financial officer, said the German industrial giant expects to post sales of DM96bn in 1993, down from DM98.5bn in 1992. Daimler is basing its growing optimism for 1994 on hopes that it will double its expected 1993 sales of its C-class Mercedes-Benz cars.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Zhuhai, June 7 (XINHUA) -- A film festival aimed at  "both sides of the Taiwan Straits and Hong Kong" will be held in  Zhuhai City, in south China's Guangdong Province, from June 15  to 19.    Thirteen films from the Chinese mainland, Taiwan and Hong  Kong have been selected for a festival-sponsored contest -- the  first of its kind in China -- and 24 other films from the three  places will also be shown in Zhuhai City during the festival.    The 13-strong festival jury, chosen from all three places,  is  to award nine prizes. Its chairman will be Ding Qiao, noted  film director and former vice-minister of radio, film and  television.    The 37 films to be screened during the festival were chosen  by the organizing committee from 45 films nominated by the three  places.</p>

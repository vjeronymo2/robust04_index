			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] NEC has developed technology to form the minute  capacitors needed in 1 Gbit DRAM's, the temporary read/write  memory required for memory storage operations, using a strontium  titanate thin film which is a material with a high dielectric  constant. NEC has succeeded in leading the world in the  formation of a practical dielectric film with an average  thickness of 50 nm by a proprietary CVD method that concentrates  on a technique to supply the raw material gases. In order to  realize a 1 Gbit DRAM, it is indispensable to break through the  barriers using new technologies that differ from the  conventional in every manufacturing process. NEC's new  technology is recognized to be one of these.    Ordinary memory cells are configured by one transistor and  one capacitor. The current technological development involves a  technology that forms a dielectric film on an electrode that is  a capacitor and accumulates electric charge. The charge  accumulates on the surface of the electrode and the dielectric  film, and a signal is stored in memory. It is difficult to  maintain the volume of capacitor accumulation charges while  improving the degree of DRAM integration and promoting the  miniaturization of processes, and this has become a big problem.  For this reason, in order to realize 1 Gbit DRAM's it is  indispensable to replace conventionally used silicon oxide and  nitride films and tantalum oxide films, and to establish a thin  film formation technology for substances with a higher  conductivity.    NEC's use of strontium titanate to form a thin film is a  electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) and metal oxide CVD method.  Gasified strontium, titanium and oxygen are transported via  separate piping, and are mixed directly before blowing them on a  substrate maintained at 600&deg; C. An ECR plasma of oxygen is  generated during the formation of the film, and this promotes  the decomposition of the raw material gases and the supply of  oxygen necessary in the film. Thin films can be formed that have  an even chemical composition by incorporating propriety  techniques into the equipment such as supplying the three kinds  of gases in a stabilized condition in separate piping, and  introducing technology that controls the pressure of the  titanium group gases. The characteristics of the film made by  this technology have achieved practical levels for the light  refractive index, for the dielectric constant and for current  leaks. This shows the uniform quality of the materials.    NEC already developed a thin film formation technology for  strontium titanate using the physical vapor deposition method  called sputtering, but it was difficult to form a film of a  fixed thickness on electrodes that have a three dimensional  structure. This problem can be solved by thin film formation  technology using the proprietary CVD method. NEC will announce  the results of its research at the American Materials Society  that will convene in San Francisco. Making X-ray exposure  practical is also indispensable to realizing DRAM's.</p>

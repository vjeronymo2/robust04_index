			<p>921109 FT  09 NOV 92 / Scots concern on accountants A QUARTER of Scottish businesses believe the standard of service offered by accountancy firms has declined according to a survey from CA Magazine and Capital House. A third said the decline was the result of too much fee-chasing by accountants, and a further 18 per cent said it because the audit service offered had deteriorated. Fifteen per cent said the firms had become more impersonal. Fifty-six per cent of businesses believed the standards of service from accountants had not changed, and 17 per cent believed they had changed for the better. They said the most important factors in assessing auditors were regular contact with a partner, experience of the business sector, a capacity to offer a wide range of services, and clarity of fee structure. The least significant factor demanded was the lowest competitive price. The businesses ranked corporate and personal tax advice, accounts preparation and corporate financial advice the most important additional services offered by audit firms. Commercial pressures are impeding the quality of independence demonstrated by small and medium-sized accountancy firms, a survey has shown. Thirty-two per cent of a sample of 492 firms said the current economic climate inhibited them qualifying clients' accounts - or expressing reservations about the accuracy of the figures in them. Thirty-eight per cent said client pressure inhibited the honest assessment of whether a company was a going concern, while 79 per cent said that making judgment on going concern was an increasing problem. The survey, carried out for the Management Information Centre, also showed there were significant increases in staff time to prepare for inspections under audit regulation requirements introduced last year. Assets and liabilities should appear in company balance sheets even if there is doubt over how to measure them, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales said yesterday. The comments come in a submission to the Accounting Standards Board (ASB) from the Financial Reporting and Auditing Group of the institute in response to two draft documents on the framework for new accounting standards.</p>

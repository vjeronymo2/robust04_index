			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / Electricity regulator sets energy-saving incentives: Littlechild intends to maintain squeeze on charges INCENTIVES for greater energy saving by electricity users were included for the first time in a new set of electricity price controls yesterday. Professor Stephen Littlechild, the industry regulator, is proposing that electricity distributors spend Pounds 1 on energy efficiency per customer each year  - or Pounds 100m over the four years that the controls will last. He also removed incentives which enable electricity companies to make profits just by selling more electricity rather than by being more efficient. The package of measures unveiled by Prof. Littlechild is part one of a two-year review of prices in the privatised regional electricity companies (RECs). Although this stage affects only the supply business, which accounts for 10 per cent of REC operating profits, it indicates that Prof. Littlechild intends to tighten steadily the squeeze on electricity prices. He has set a basic limit of Pounds 10m on the costs RECs can pass on to their customers, plus an allowance for the number of customers and units of electricity sold. He is also restricting price rises to the rate of inflation minus two percentage points a year. However, he will grant an extra allowance for RECs which have exceptional costs because of factors such as high customer turnover or bad debts. The company receiving the largest allowance is London Electricity with Pounds 6m. It was not clear whether the company saw this as enough. A spokesman said there would be no comment until the board had reviewed the proposals. Any REC can appeal to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission against the regulator's actions. Other RECs said the package looked tough but manageable. Mr John Harris, chairman of East Midlands Electricity, said: 'It is challenging. But we're very supportive of his approach because he will be rewarding efficiency.' Householders will not notice any immediate change from the new controls, which do not take effect for a year, and the impact of the next stage of the review, of electricity distribution prices, will be much bigger. But Prof. Littlechild said yesterday's measures would produce a small cut in prices, and oblige RECs to be more cost-conscious. He also confirmed his intention to remove all price controls for customers using more than 100KW a year, starting next April, as part of a move towards total deregulation by 1998. On the stock market there was relief that the controls were less tough on the RECs than feared. But there was disappointment in the energy efficiency industry at the size of the savings.

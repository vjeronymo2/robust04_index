			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / Walesa snub for Solidarity convention POLISH President Lech Walesa yesterday refused an invitation to attend a Solidarity trade union convention after delegates decided not to support his non-party bloc in September parliamentary elections, Reuter reports from Zielona Gora. Mr Walesa's spokesman said the president decided not to come to the congress of the union he once led because the delegates had voted on whether Mr Walesa should be invited at all. 'This is an unprecedented situation. If such actions are taken it is hard for the president to consider that his presence is really necessary and expected,' the spokesman told private Polish Radio Z. The union sought to invite Mr Walesa to attend yesterday, a day after they rejected his offer to join his newly-formed alliance of independent groups and decided to submit their own candidates for the election on September 19. At the congress in the south-western city of Zielona Gora, several Solidarity delegates opposed inviting Mr Walesa who had hoped to win support for his Non-Party Bloc of Support for Reforms (BBWR). 'It would be a Trojan horse at the congress. Mr Walesa has already begun his election campaign for the BBWR,' Mr Tomasz Wojcik, a delegate, said. Solidarity's participation in the BBWR - which Mr Walesa hopes will help the next government force through economic reform - would have boosted the bloc's chances of becoming an important force in parliament. On Saturday 253 Solidarity delegates voted to run alone and only 28 wanted to join Mr Walesa's alliance. Many workers still regard the union as the force which is best able to represent their interests.</p>

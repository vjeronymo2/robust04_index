			<p><P> August 8, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VOTING  </P> <P> It is not only an honor but a sacred trust to have the power to make daily  decisions that affect the lives of every American. Each time we go to the polls  we vote for our chosen representatives as "our voice" in our government, and so  endow those individuals with the awesome authority to speak for us. But since  we don't receive daily memos from them as to what's transpiring in the meeting  rooms of our nation's Capitol, nor do we have box seats at Senate debates, we  rarely know what legislation has been proposed, enacted or repealed until it is  a fait accompli. So, it is with a deep sense of shock and outrage to hear of a  proposed bill (S-874), which calls for "instant voter registration" -- a plan  to automatically register people to vote when they renew their driver's  license.  </P> <P> According to the sponsor of this "motor-voter" bill, Sen. Wendell Ford (D-Ky.),  "It will remove obstacles from voter registration and encourage more people to  vote."  </P> <P> Surely at a time when fake IDs are as easily purchased as a box of Cracker Jack  by illegal aliens and others who have ulterior motives for possessing them, the  intelligence and motives of the sponsor and endorsers of this legislation must  be seriously questioned.  </P> <P> To allow such irresponsible and dangerous legislation to go unchallenged is to  open the door to "voting by phone" or even total abolishment of the need to  register.  </P> <P> RUTH COFFEY  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 20, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN QUENTIN DEATH VIGIL  </P> <P> Apparently the passage of laws doesn't mean a thing to some California  residents. I am referring to the death penalty law.  </P> <P> Why those bleeding hearts, who keep a vigil outside San Quentin prison, waste  their sympathies on the likes of Harris, instead of the families of the  teen-agers he killed, is beyond my understanding. These people need to put  themselves in the victims' families shoes, and feel their loss.  </P> <P> Harris' trial was fair, and his sentence well-deserved. Did his victims receive  a fair trial?  </P> <P> Whether or not these murderer sympathizers agree with the law, they should  accept it gracefully, because this law is favored by the majority. That is what  democracy is all about.  </P> <P> Besides, all of those murderers still sitting on Death Row should have their  sentences carried out at once. Our appeals system is a farce. It wastes  taxpayer money and protects the guilty. I feel that a limit of two appeals per  convict would be fair enough.  </P> <P> SIDNEY TRIGHER  </P> <P> Costa Mesa  </P></p>

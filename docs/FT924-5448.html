			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets: ERM influences volume in October - Equity turnover jumped in Italy and Spain October saw a decline in hard-currency markets as a home for equity investment funds in Europe. Equity market turnover figures also demonstrate the appeal of markets linked with devaluation prospects, after the partial collapse of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) in September. After a 37 per cent gain in September, turnover at Europe's top eight bourses eased back by 5.7 per cent last in October, says Mr James Cornish at County NatWest Securities, which produces the turnover figures. There were big variations at national level. In Italy, a stiff budget following the lira's devaluation in mid-September and the government's determination to make its financial legislation effective was the key to the equity turnover revival which took it up by 58 per cent on the month, and nearly trebled the figure from a depressed base in August. The view that the Italian prime minister, Mr Giuliano Amato, is doing a good job and speculation regarding the country's privatisation plans also lifted turnover. With the government giving up control of major companies and reorganisation prospects in the Italian economy, the thought is that Italian minority shareholders could benefit for once as the companies concerned lose their takeover-proof status. Spain has now devalued twice over two months. The process left it with a sharp drop in equity values in September and a meagre recovery in October. However, a 3 per cent rise in the Madrid general index has been outdistanced by a 19 per cent gain in equity market turnover - taking activity to more than double the level of two months earlier. There seems to have been little short-term reward for good fiscal and economic stewardship in the other European equity markets. The French, Swiss and Dutch economies have paid for their hard currencies with high interest rates, an effective revaluation against their trading partners and the obvious consequences for corporate earnings. In September, while there may have been some inward investment, international equity business in France, Switzerland and the Netherlands involved divestment out of markets lifted by currency appreciation. In October, French equity turnover fell by 19.5 per cent; the traditional safe havens, the Netherlands and Switzerland, by 2.8 and 12.1 per cent respectively; and Germany by 9.5 per cent after a miserly pick-up a month before. Last month, the efforts which the hard-currency countries had made to stay in line with the D-Mark were overshadowed by the recovery in the dollar. This left them less attractive as a target or as a home for overseas investment; and Germany was about to sustain the shock of its corporate performance figures in the fourth quarter of 1992.  -------------------------------------------------------------------                     EUROPEAN EQUITIES TURNOVER               Monthly total in local currencies (bn)  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Bourse               Jul       Aug        Sep        Oct     US                     1992      1992       1992       1992  Dollars bn  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Belgium            34.78     41.38      42.76      47.56     1.64 France            100.18     64.52     134.26     108.08    22.55 Germany           121.51    101.72     109.19      98.85    69.95 Italy          11,975.60  6,039.60  10,808.00  17,112.00    14.17 Netherlands        13.10      9.80      14.41      14.00     8.81 Spain             538.64    317.47     578.78     687.70     6.85 Switzerland        10.89      9.01      13.40      11.78     9.33 UK                 34.33     26.68      45.30      39.76    67.81  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Volumes represent purchases and sales.

			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Survey of Residential Property (10): A master plan to halt the cowboy builders - Portugal / Audrey Powell studies the new rules governing land for building plots The Algarve property market is going through more change, says Graham Fone, director of Portogoa, a Lagos-based company which builds individual houses in this southern region of Portugal. 'During the boom, speculators came to the Algarve to make money,' recalls Fone, an English civil engineer. 'Large plots of land were bought cheaply and permission was obtained to develop them. With this consent they went back on the market for a greatly increased sum. During the late 1980s, 60 per cent of what had been approved had never been built. The whole planning process went totally out of control.' The government brought in legislation, called Protal, to rectify this. Under the new law, there can be no more construction on individual plots of land; approved urbanisations which have not been started risk losing consent; every municipal authority must prepare a master plan. 'Today we have reached the stage where the master plans have been prepared and are on public display in the town halls,' says Fone. Many approved urbanisations that have not been started have been cancelled.' To exist alongside the big developers building for the mass holiday-home market, companies such as Portogoa relied on families wanting their own special houses on plots that kept them at a distance from neighbours and tour parties. 'New construction on individual plots of land has now been stopped, and only plots with an old ruin or with permission granted before Protal was introduced can be built on,' says Fone. 'We foresee that within two years all new construction will be confined to the existing urbanised developments.' This is a complete reversal of the days of the cowboys, when uncontrolled building was allowed to ruin much of central Algarve. So what does a small company such as Portogoa do? Undismayed, Fone points out that customers' demands have changed, and a small builder is able to respond quickly to their new requirements. 'Five to 10 years ago the villa in the Algarve was a holiday home. Today most of our clients are looking to settle permanently in Portugal. With the freedom of movement now within the common market, we foresee a migration from the north.' He thinks Portugal will benefit. But the requirements of a client wanting to live there permanently would be different from those wanting a holiday home. For people wanting a permanent home, it was of paramount importance that the villa should be dry and centrally heated. People also needed storage space for possessions collected over the years. There is a further reason that is causing Portogoa to swerve from its original course. In the search for sites that are not on a new development, but where the company might build a new property, it is always looking out for ruined farmhouses that could be demolished, so that the plot could be re-used. But clients who are taken to see such plots often ask if the company could renovate the farm property instead of building anew. 'This is the buyer's dream. In practice, due to the laws that require a concrete frame for the building, it is easier to knock it down and rebuild.' So that is what the company does. 'We have reconstructed a number, keeping as many original features as possible.' The company has just finished work on such a property, east of Silves, for a client, and has another plot in the same area. This, including the ruin, is priced at Pounds 102,000, and renovation would probably cost a further Pounds 110,000. For that, a buyer would get his farmhouse - which would look old, but comply with today's requirements - with the interior as he wanted it. This seems to be a growing market, says Fone. In general, prices for building plots along the coastal strip are between Pounds 40,000 and Pounds 100,000. Inland, prices range between Pounds 20,000 and Pounds 60,000. The company's villa prices go from Pounds 50,000, for a two-bedroom property, up to Pounds 150,000 for a villa with four bedrooms and four bathrooms, excluding land. Construction takes eight to 10 months. For more information tel: 82 341035 or (UK) 081-851 1012.</p>

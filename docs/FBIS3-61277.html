			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Sergey Stepashin, first deputy director of </F> the Federal Counterintelligence Service, by TRUD special  correspondents Vitaliy Golovachev and Yuriy Dmitriyev; place and  date not given: "Counterintelligence: A Look From the  Inside--Sergey Stepashin, first deputy director of the Federal  Counterintelligence Service, Talks About the New Russian Secret  Service"]    [Text] For many decades the state security organs  were the most powerful and mysterious organization in the former  USSR. The tumultuous events of the past few years could not  bypass them. The Main Protection Directorate, the Federal  Government Communications and Information Agency, and foreign  intelligence became independent agencies... In December of last  year an edict of the president of Russia disbanded the Ministry  of Security and announced the creation of a new Federal  Counterintelligence Service (FCS). What do all these changes  mean for the country? What will the new secret service be like?  In what way will it be different from the old one? We posed all  these questions to Sergey Stepashin, first deputy director of  the Federal Counterintelligence Service.    "In many respects this organization will be different from  the old Ministry of Security," said Sergey Vadimovich. "Here are  our six main tasks.    "First. Exposure, prevention, and suppression of  intelligence and sabotage activities of foreign special services  and organizations against Russia.    "Second. Obtaining intelligence information on  threats to the national security.    "Third. Providing information to the president of  the Russian Federation on threats to national security.    "Fourth. Combating terrorism and illegal  circulation of arms and drugs. This also includes uncovering and  neutralizing illegal armed formations, as well as uncovering  illegally created or banned public associations that encroach on  the constitutional system of Russia.    "Fifth. Ensuring within our jurisdiction the  protection of state secrets.    "Sixth. Counterintelligence support for  operational protection of state borders.    "As you can see, the FCS will not have many of the old  functions. For instance, we will no longer be involved in  investigations (and therefore the investigative department is  being transferred to the Office of the Procurator General).  Neither will we have the investigative detention facility in  Lefortovo--it is being transferred to the MVD [Ministry of  Internal Affairs]. The only function we retain is inquiry  (urgent investigative actions within a short period of time).    "Next, drugs inside the country are not our province,  either.  The FCS will investigate only those cases where the drug  business is linked to foreign partners."    [TRUD] What about corruption?    [Stepashin] Only in the event that it involves the highest  echelons of power. The rest will be handled by the procuracy and  the MVD. The same goes for gangsterism and routine criminal  offenses...    Overall, the Federal Counterintelligence Service's staff  will  be half as large as that of the former Ministry of Security  [MB]. The MB had a staff of 138,000; the FCS will have 75,000  (nationwide).    [TRUD] How many people will you have in Moscow?    [Stepashin] Approximately 1,500, not counting the  scientific-research institute, military-medical units,  maintenance personnel, and protection and maintenance of  buildings and facilities.    [TRUD] Is the structure of the federal service a secret?    [Stepashin] What specifically do you want to know?    [TRUD] For instance, what departments will the FCS have?  Will  there not be, for instance, an entity under a new name similar  to the notorious former Fifth Main Directorate of the KGB, which  investigated the differently minded, "dissidents"?    [Stepashin] Even the Ministry of Security that was abolished  in December no longer engaged in political investigations; this  will be even more true for counterintelligence. The entire FCS  structure, all its departments, will correspond precisely to the  tasks defined for our service, which I have already enumerated.    If readers are interested, the FCS structure is as follows.  First, the counterintelligence operations administration. This,  I think is self-explanatory: Exposing agents of foreign  services, etc. Next, the counterintelligence support for  strategic facilities administration. This involves the security  of nuclear stations and other nuclear facilities,  transportation, communications, and protection of state secrets.    Next, the following administrations: military and economic  counterintelligence; antiterrorism; information and analysis;  search operations; and operational-technical measures. Other  units are in a way auxiliary, providing support for FCS  operations: contracting and legal; personnel; economic... A  total of 20 administrations, including medical and the Public  Relations Center.    I repeat: Our main task is counterintelligence; the FCS does  not have any other tasks.    [TRUD] Who is the Federal Counterintelligence Service  subordinated to?    [Stepashin] Directly to the president of the Russian  Federation.    [TRUD] Can local authorities direct the work of FCS' local  units?    [Stepashin] No, they cannot, although, naturally, we will  work in contact with local authorities. But the specificity of  the FCS' work is such that all units must be rigidly  subordinated vertically to the center.    [TRUD] Corruption is so pervasive today among Russian  bureaucrats that this is openly discussed both in our country  and abroad. Will the FCS have sufficient resources to combat  very influential corrupt officials in the highest echelons of  power?    [Stepashin] There should be no doubt in this respect. All  such materials will be handed over to the procuracy and directly  to the president of the country, who demands an unrelenting  fight against corruption at any level. No matter what job a  person holds, he will not escape responsibility if he is caught  with his hand in a honey pot. It is another matter that the  materials collected must be totally convincing. It was due to  insufficient evidence that in the recent past officials who used  their position for personal enrichment were able to escape  punishment. We have learned from this experience.    Simultaneously, we need to strengthen the legislative base,  to make it absolutely clear what an official cannot do (for  instance, be a part of commercial structures, including  foreign), and what does not constitute a violation of law; what  is the mechanism of penalty for violations; and so on. An edict  on civil service is an important step in this direction. Other  legal acts are in the works.    [TRUD] Are there currently any specific cases "in the  development stage" involving corruption in the highest echelons  of power?    [Stepashin] Yes. You realize I cannot yet mention any  details, but these are very serious cases; our specialists are  following a hot trail and are checking carefully and  scrupulously.    [TRUD] Lately the press has frequently published reports of  serious violations of the law by MVD personnel. In the past such  facts were investigated by organs of state security. Now that  the MB has been abolished, does it mean that the MVD, customs,  and tax services will be completely unsupervised?    [Stepashin] Why unsupervised? First, there is the procuracy,  whose task is to monitor observance of the law. Second, we are  not going to stand on the sidelines either--the MVD, the  customs, and the tax police will not be left "unsupervised."  Honest people have nothing to fear. Those, however, who violate  the law must bear responsibility in accordance with the law.    [TRUD] How do top officials in the government feel about the  activities of security services?    [Stepashin] We encounter great understanding. Recently, for  instance, we discussed with First Deputy Prime Minister Yegor  Gaydar issues related to the country's economic security. He was  particularly interested in matters related to product exports  (the potential for abuse, illegal deals, etc.). Another example:  Anatoliy Chubays asked us not to recall our service's  specialists who are on assignment at the Russian Federation  Committee for the Administration of State Property and to assist  in averting machinations in the course of privatization of state  enterprises.    [TRUD] A report was made public recently that many  commercial  banks are under tremendous pressure from the mafia. Those top  bank officials who do not agree to cooperate with the mafia are  simply being liquidated; evidence of this is the number of  contract murders last year. It is easy to imagine what will  happen if the financial system ends up in the hands of corrupt  structures...    [Stepashin] We have an agreement with the Central Bank  Chairman Viktor Gerashchenko that our services will take the  national banking system under protection. In addition, banks  have their own security services.    [TRUD] The results of the recent parliamentary elections  were  completely unexpected for the powers that be. Does this mean  that nobody in the country knows what the people's mood is?    [Stepashin] Zhirinovskiy's success was not a surprise for  our  services. Sociological services use their own methods to study  public opinion; our services get this kind of information  through their channels. Even before 12 December the analytical  department produced this forecast: Zhirinovskiy's party may get  24 percent of the vote in the elections (as you can see, the  forecast was very precise). All these materials were sent  "upstairs" in time...    [TRUD] What about you personally: Do you get information  about the popular mood only from analytical summaries?    [Stepashin] First, we do not produce these kind of  "summaries" on a regular basis. (The forecast of election  results is not a typical occasion). It is not the FCS' task to  identify and evaluate popular moods. I think a lot of people  would be glad to immediately accuse us of reanimating political  investigations...    [TRUD] Why investigations? Is knowing the popular mood an  investigation? How is it possible to run the country without  knowing what people are happy or unhappy about? If the FCS is  tasked with this, however, will you be able to carry it out?    [Stepashin] Of course. But until we are charged with such a  task, we do not do this on a regular basis. As to popular moods,  they are generally known. There are, of course, those who are  doing fine, who have adapted to the market environment, but  there are also many who have found themselves beached. I  recently visited my relatives in the town of Sobinka in Vladimir  Oblast. My cousin works at a textile factory, which is now idle.  He is paid 12,000 rubles a month. He does not have dinner every  day. And there are others like him. What kind of mood can these  people be in? I was told a lot of things in Sobinka...    [TRUD] The stratification in society is growing; about 40  million people do not have the income to provide for even a most  modest sustenance minimum. Some political scientists talk about  growing social tensions in society, the potential for intense  social conflicts. Until a way is found to attenuate hardship for  tens of millions low-income people, the situation may intensify  to the limit. In your opinion, could conflicts grow into civil  war?    [Stepashin] I do not think so. The government said clearly  that social orientation of the reforms will be strengthened. And  if stabilization processes begin at the end of the year; if the  production decline is halted and structural restructuring in  industry begins, positive changes will affect the social climate  as well.    [TRUD] It is being said that during the period of  reorganization of the security services they have ended up being  sort of paralyzed, incapable of functioning, and the country has  been left unprotected. Is this true?    [Stepashin] Nothing of the kind; the work has never stopped  and is continuing right now. And it would be impossible to  suspend it anyway: For one, there is the unceasing stream of  contraband people try to smuggle out of the country. For  instance, in Orenburg Oblast it was discovered that 667 kg of  gold and 21,770 kg of silver had been exported abroad as part of  black copper alloys from the Mednogorsk integrated copper  smelter and sulfuric acid plant. Now the joint enterprise will  reimburse the cost of exported precious metals in hard currency  (about $10 million). In Pskov Oblast, two railcars (135 tonnes)  with 8.45-caliber cartridges were intercepted on route to  Estonia... I could give you numerous examples of this nature.    Neither is there any decrease in active intelligence  activities against Russia, and it is conducted not only by  special services of "far abroad" countries but also by Baltic  and CIS countries. Twenty people were arrested in 1993 on  charges of espionage. Several dozen more cases involving  espionage are under investigation.    [TRUD] There are many rumors regarding the circumstances of  Barkashov's arrest. How was he actually found? And why was he  not arrested while he was in the White House?    [Stepashin] I know Barkashov by sight, and I saw him on 4  October on television, when he was being escorted with others  out of the White House. After that, the militia handled each  person individually. Why Barkashov was not detained I do not  know...    Later, when the task was set to find him and bring him in  for  questioning, our services began the search. We followed his  trail--we knew he was in Moscow. It was only a matter of time.  At the end of December our officers found out that he had been  admitted to hospital. The rest is history.    By the way, a while back the Security Service sent the  procuracy (the procurator general) materials on military  training and other actions of extremists led by Barkashov.  Nevertheless, later on the Ministry of Justice... officially  registered the organization, and it acquired legal status...    [TRUD] Last question. Regarding the upcoming visit of the  U.S. President Clinton to Moscow. How will his security be  handled?    [Stepashin] As usual. The Main Protection Administration and  our services are doing everything necessary in coordination with  representatives of the U.S. special services. Several thousand  operatives will be on duty during the visit. The U.S.  President's security is completely guaranteed.    I would like to say in conclusion that the Federal  Counterintelligence Service will build its work on the  principles of legality, respect for human rights and freedoms,  and humanism. This is the alpha and omega of our entire work.</p>

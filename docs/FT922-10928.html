			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Chinese rediscover their taste for the turf A BAN of more than 40 years ended yesterday with China's first horse race meeting since the communists came to power being held in the southern city of Guangzhou. Horse racing was banned after the communists had labelled gambling one of the seven evils, along with prostitution, slavery, kidnapping, drugs, pornography and feudal superstition. The meeting yesterday left a young worker from a city tax office richer by 50,000 yuan (Dollars 12,500), but not from backing winners. Guangzhou's officials have got round the problem of gambling by charging 50 yuan (Dollars 12.5) for entry tickets which carry chances to win cash prizes based on the results of races. The number of this winning ticket corresponded to the numbers of the fastest horses in the first four heats in order. 'It is completely different from the gambling in Hong Kong races,' said Wei Zhenlan, director of the Guangdong Province Sports Commission, quoted in a front-page report in China Daily yesterday. 'Instead of gambling, the prizes are the only way to attract people to the race,' he said. A total of 5,000 tickets for the six-race meeting were sold, creating a dividend pool of 250,000 yuan. About 60 per cent of the gate money was distributed to the holders of winning tickets. Guangzhou's Huangchun course is on a former airfield built by the Japanese in the 1940s. Forty-seven jockeys from Hong Kong, Guangdong, Mongolia and Xinjiang took part. A six-year-old Mongolian pony took top honours, winning the Jimma (Golden Horse) Racing Championship. Major General Guy Watkins of the Royal Hong Kong Jockey Club declared the event a great success. He told China Daily: 'I've been to many cities where amateur races are held, but the people did not have as much fun as they are having here.' The booming city of Guangzhou has once again beaten the port city of Shanghai to the post. Shanghai's Liberation Daily newspaper announced on Friday that the city would allow horse-racing for the first time since 1949. A Shanghai business group has agreed with a Japanese consortium to build a Dollars 10m racecourse for the city. The track will accommodate 10,000 people and use electronic equipment from Japan. No date has been given for racing to begin, but Shanghai was a centre for horse-racing between the world wars.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, June 23 (BTA) -- Today parliament passed at  second reading amendments to the Political and Civil  Rehabilitation of the Victims of Repression Act, effective since  June 29, 1991. Under the amendments, compensation claims will be  filed at the Finance Ministry within five years from the coming  into force of the act (instead of three years, as established  previously). The amendment was prompted by the fact that many  people failed to submit their claims within the set period  because of organizational difficulties, i.e. inability to gather  the required documents in time. The parliamentary Union of  Democratic Forces (SDS) that has been boycotting parliament's  work for a month now, took part in the debate and the vote.    The MP's continued to debate at second reading parts of the  Commercial Code, regulating the state of insolvency (known also  as the bankruptcy act).    At a meeting behind closed doors the Parliamentary Foreign  Policy Committee adopted a stand on the memorandum of CE  [Council of Europe] Parliamentary Assembly rapporteurs Domenique  Coloumberg and Friedrich Koening on Bulgaria's adherence to the  commitments made upon its admission to this organization. The  two rapporteurs visited Bulgaria this April. All parliamentary  forces supported the stand, except for those from the Union of  Democratic Forces (SDS) who walked out. Mr. Ivan Genov, MP of  the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), told BTA's reporter that  "the memorandum is excessively one- sided and represents only  the attitude of the SDS, ignoring all other political forces."  In his opinion, the committee's stand is intended to prevent  the Council of Europe from interfering in internal political  struggles. "Bulgaria strictly observes its commitments as  member of the Council of Europe. There is political pluralism  in this country, a freely elected parliament and a free press.  The human rights are guaranteed. The committee understands  that the transition naturally poses serious problems, but they  do not call Bulgaria's commitments to the CE in question," runs  the stand. The SDS representatives opposed it. "This is the  first time someone dares accuse CE rapporteurs in partiality and  prejudice," said MP Asparukh Panov. Later today the MP's of the  SDS declared that the memorandum was objective and benevolent  towards Bulgaria and to the difficulties it is facing in the  period of transition to market economy.    At its meeting today, attended by representatives of the  Defence Ministry, the Foreign Ministry and the Presidency, the  Parliamentary National Security Committee approved a draft  resolution on the participation of Bulgarian battleships in  Turkish military exercises. The committee insists that the  draft resolution be debated at a plenary sitting as soon as  possible, as the two exercises begin July 4. The motion was  made by the Council of Ministers. The committee heard experts'  reports on different aspects of the document for Bulgaria's  participation in the Partnership for Peace initiative. The  document was approved by the Council of Ministers as a basis for  negotiations with NATO.</p>

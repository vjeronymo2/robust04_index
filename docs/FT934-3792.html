			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Survey of Energy Efficiency (1): A burning global issue - Most countries plan energy saving measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. But although there is scope for much greater fuel efficiency, governments are failing to provide enough money to convert their words into action Energy efficiency evokes the same general acclaim as world peace. But individuals, and even governments, are generally hesitant to back their support with generous supplies of hard cash. With crude oil prices at their lowest in real terms for 20 years and most domestic fuel bills unchanged in recent years, there is not the urgency to save energy that existed in the 1970s. Gone too is the fear that world fossil fuel resources are rapidly running out. The agenda for the energy efficiency industry has shifted to environmental objectives. Most governments plan to use some energy saving measures as a way of stabilising greenhouse gas emissions and environmentalists believe that energy conservation must play a large part in combating global warming. Mr Kenneth Clarke, UK chancellor of the exchequer, underlined the government's plans to use energy efficiency measures as part of its battle against global warming when he almost doubled the funds available to pensioners for home conservation measures to Pounds 35m in last week's Budget. His announcement followed criticism by a Commons select committee a week earlier which attacked the government's policies on energy efficiency as being incomplete and inadequately funded. Mr Robert Skinner, director of the long-term co-operation and policy analysis division of the International Energy Agency - the west's energy monitoring body - highlights some of the difficulties involved in adopting effective energy savings policies: 'while we all agree there is great potential for increases in energy efficiency, most governments have little idea how to go about achieving them.' He stresses that few governments have any idea of how to set realistic targets for energy conservation and, when they do, few understand how to monitor them. There is also the fear of 'bounce back,' where energy savings made in some areas do not necessarily lead to a reduction in overall energy consumption. This was experienced in Denmark where the government has very successfully improved the efficiency of new appliances in recent years so that they use a lot less electricity. But electricity consumption has risen - people have more appliances. This effect is often cited by detractors as a reason for not bothering with energy efficiency. But if living standards continue to rise, arguably the Danes would have purchased more appliances in any case and, if efficiency standards had not been increased, they would be using even more electricity. Since the residential sector of most advanced economies accounts for 60 per cent of total electricity consumption, many countries have tried to target domestic consumers in their efficiency drives. But this is, by its very nature, a fragmented and imprecise art. It is hard to convince people that they can do a lot more towards saving the world by lowering the central heating or draught proofing their windows than by recycling their rubbish. The UK government has tried to stress the environmental benefits of energy saving in a series of television adverts. 'It is a very difficult message to get across,' says Mr Colin Myerscough, director of the UK Energy Efficiency Office. Few governments can now afford to offer large grants for energy saving measures. But the new buzzword in the sector is 'voluntarism', whereby government forms partnerships with industry and utilities to promote energy conservation. In the Netherlands, which has set a target for improving energy efficiency by 20 per cent by the end of the decade, the government has signed voluntary contracts with 80 per cent of its industrial companies. These accords set out energy savings targets and realistic measures that can be taken to achieve them. US utilities have taken this a step further by paying consumers to introduce energy efficiency measures - so-called demand-side management. This is done to some extent in Europe where companies slash prices of off-peak electricity. In the US, the utilities annually spend Dollars 3bn to Dollars 4bn on these initiatives. This is partly self-interest since the regulatory regime allows companies to charge only low electricity prices while adding new plant is restrictively expensive. Although such initiatives and better industrial practices have reduced electricity demand slightly in the US, it is still three times that of Japan. The average person in the US consumed 6.3 tonnes of oil equivalent in 1973 - by 1991 that had dropped to 5.4 tonnes. In Japan, demand increased slightly from 2.3 to 2.5 tonnes. The reason for the huge gap is largely the smaller flats and closer proximity of the average Japanese household, added to the fact that many energy-intensive industries have moved out of the country since the last oil crisis. One way of encouraging more energy conservation in the home is to introduce higher standards of energy efficiency for domestic appliances. Until this year, the US was the only OECD country with mandatory appliance efficiency standards. These were recently expanded to include commercial heating, cooling and water heating. Early this year, Canada passed legislation providing for energy efficiency standards for 20 products including household equipment. The European Union has been studying whether to take a similar step and plans to introduce a directive on energy standards for fridges and freezers that would become effective in 1995 or 1997. One problem, aired by Mr Andrew Warren, director of the Association for the Conservation of Energy in the UK, is that when gaining agreement between all member states for such a step standards can become watered down to the lowest common denominator. Some countries are also labelling appliances for their energy efficiency. Other countries have adopted innovative, market-led approaches to the problem. For example, in Sweden, the National Board for Industrial and Technical Development introduced a competitive procurement programme open to Swedish and foreign companies. It guaranteed companies a market for the most energy-efficient products they could produce - the government would buy them for public housing. As a result of the Swedish competition, a fridge was developed which was 35 per cent more energy-efficient than the market average. The success of the programme has led the government to look at other procurement projects for advanced window design. In the US, a group has been launched called the Consortium for Energy Efficiency, with members from public and private sectors. The consortium has launched a 'golden carrot' strategy to develop 250,000 fridges that are 25 to 50 per cent more energy-efficient than comparable 1993 models. The winning manufacturer will receive Dollars 30m which has been pooled by US utilities as well as free promotion to the utility customers. While curbing energy use in the home is likely to continue to be a piecemeal and fragmented operation, governments are being urged by environmental lobbies to introduce concerted transport policies in an effort to reduce emissions. But the transport sector has proved strongly resistant to efforts to conserve fuel. Most developed countries have flirted with the idea of a carbon tax, but this has proved to be politically unpalatable even if it could be shown to work. International Energy Agency studies report that carbon taxes would have to be set at very high levels to curb car use and, even then, the effects would be short-lived. Mr Skinner believes that, rather than imposing carbon taxes, developed countries should work towards integrated planning regulations that ensure any new buildings - particularly out-of-town housing estates - while adhering to strict energy efficient building codes, should also be linked to a public transport system that discourages car use over the longer term. In short, energy efficiency is a fragmented industry where grand initiatives tend to be inappropriate. Governments are adopting a piecemeal approach as a way of meeting environmental targets. They are urged to do more by vocal environmental lobbies, but low energy prices provide little incentive. And households are unlikely to be spurred on to make great energy savings until they are hit where it hurts: in their wallets.</p>

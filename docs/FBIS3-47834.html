It will strengthen its early-warning capability by stepping  up its efforts to collect and analyze data on North Korea,  including information on developments in North Korea's nuclear  development program, its policy toward South Korea and its  military structure.    The NSP will be restructured in accordance with the NSP law  as amended late last year so that it can better promote the  national interest and security, Director Kim said.    Information services for the private sector will be  increased  to make the NSP an intelligence and information agency in which  the people have full trust, he said.    President Kim responded to the report by expressing his hope  that the NSP grows into a world-level information and  intelligence agency.    "We're living in an era where information is power," he told  the NSP chief.</p>

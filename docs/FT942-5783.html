			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Survey of Foreign Exchange (9): Quest for order continues - The pressures for greater stability in currencies The world has now been living for 21 years with a monetary system dominated by floating exchange rates. But there continues to be a yearning among some policy makers, active and retired, for more order, reminiscent of the currency stability that existed under the post-war Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates. Despite all the problems suffered by members of the European exchange rate mechanism in 1992 and 1993, finance ministers from continental Europe have put greater exchange rate stability back on the international monetary agenda. Announcing this step after the spring meeting of the policy-making Interim Committee of the International Monetary Fund, Philippe Maystadt, the Belgian finance minister and committee chairman, said the Fund's executive board had been asked to study, and report back by October, 'possible ways to introduce a greater degree of discipline in the present exchange rate system'. Around the same time, Helmut Schmidt, the distinguished former chancellor of Germany, called for Franco-German co-operation to restore orderly currency relationships for Europe against the dollar and yen 'that were lost at the beginning of the 1970s'. Other eminent former policy makers are beavering away in a grandly named Bretton Woods Commission which is due to report next month on the 50th anniversary of the Bretton Woods agreement. Their objective is to 'formulate and agree on proposals for the reform of the international monetary system, the International Monetary Fund and World Bank which will help set their course as the 21st century approaches'. At first sight there is much merit in the goal of greater exchange rate stability. More fixed exchange rates are of obvious benefit to international travellers and businesses that import and export. In spite of sophisticated hedging techniques, it is likely that exchange rate volatility hinders international trade and investment. Long-term misalignments, such as the big appreciation of the US dollar in the early 1980s, distort investment decisions and can foster protectionism. Moreover, with hindsight, the period of fixed exchange rates in the industrialised world that followed the second world war looks like a golden age. Growth was faster than it has been since the collapse of Bretton Woods in 1973 and the industrial countries, which now support a 35m-strong army of unemployed, could boast of full employment in the 1950s and 1960s. But it was also an age of strict controls over capital movements in which comparatively few rich countries called the shots. Changes in the world economy since the early 1970s make it very difficult to imagine a successful return to Bretton Woods. When the Group of Seven leading industrial countries tried to stabilise their exchange rates through the Louvre Accord of February 1987, some, notably Japan and Britain, found that their domestic economic stability was undermined. In Japan's case an excessively easy monetary policy, that was intended to prevent appreciation of the yen, fuelled the now notorious 'bubble economy'. In Britain, Chancellor Nigel Lawson's struggle to prevent sterling appreciating against the D-Mark hindered a much needed tightening of monetary policy to curb a growing boom. The result was a rapid increase in UK inflation, followed eventually by soaring interest rates and a very damaging recession. More recently, massive free-flowing capital movements triggered crises in the European Monetary System in 1992 and 1993. After such experiences, it is not surprising that there are no official moves afoot to replace the present 'non-system' of floating exchange rates with a more orderly system of fixed parities. For starters, the adoption of narrow fluctuation bands akin to the Bretton Woods system of near stable exchange rates would require countries to reach agreement on appropriate parities. This, says Morris Goldstein, deputy head of the IMF's research department, 'would be no easy task'. Still more problematic would be the subordination of monetary policy to exchange rate goals, that would be required if such a system were to survive. But if fixed exchange rates are not the route to greater discipline in the international monetary system, what is? An indication came in the response of Michel Camdessus, the IMF managing director, to Mr Maystadt's announcement in April. Mr Camdessus said his 'instinctive reaction' was that there was more prospect of addressing exchange rate instability at the world level through strengthened surveillance and co-ordination of economic policies than through co-ordinated intervention in the foreign exchange markets. In other words, the best way to exchange rate stability begins at home. This maxim is likely to be endorsed by the Bretton Woods Commission, when it reports in July, and the IMF executive board when it submits its findings to the Interim Committee's next meeting in Madrid in October. It would be surprising if both groups did not lay great stress on the need for convergence of inflation rates, greater savings and domestic investment and determined action to reduce fiscal deficits as the path to greater currency stability. It is unclear, however, whether the two bodies will go so far as to suggest that such domestic-oriented approaches could one day lead to 'target zones' in which the monetary authorities would keep the principal trading currencies - the dollar, D-Mark and yen - within relatively narrow ranges of each other. Last month Mr Camdessus expressed his doubts. As well as a high degree of convergence and increased attention to macroeconomic co-ordination, achieving exchange rate stability through target zones would require an 'exceptionally high degree of collective determination . . . given the high cost that may have to be paid for this in terms of growth and employment in the short term.' Such collective determination does not exist. It was 'not accepted to the same degree in the three major currency areas of the world,' he said. Mr Goldstein is doubtless right when he says that a fundamental reform of the international monetary system is 'not on the near-term horizon'. But Mr Maystadt's initiative in the April Interim Committee and the musings of men such as former chancellor Helmut Schmidt show it is a subject that will not go away.</p>

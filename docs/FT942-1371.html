			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Leading Article: Democracy in the dark The main issue facing the EU summit in Corfu today is the choice of the next president of the Commission. It is an important choice, even if the successful candidate is unlikely to play the strategic role that Jacques Delors did in the last 10 years. The Commission retains the sole right to initiate EU legislation. It also has the task of articulating the common interest of the Union as a whole - a role which may be more important rather than less if the political initiative has now passed, as many believe, to national leaders. Within the Commission, that role will fall especially to the president, who this time has also been promised a say in the choice of his colleagues. Choosing the next president is a particularly invidious task for the European Council, since two of its own number are declared candidates - an unprecedented circumstance which shows how much Mr Delors' long tenure has raised the post's prestige. It seems unlikely that the council will be able to agree. The Greek prime minister, in the chair, is too isolated to act as an effective broker; and the German chancellor, though now clearly the effective leader of the Union, may have overplayed his hand in letting his support for Jean-Luc Dehaene become known in advance. To the positive sympathy enjoyed in some capitals by Ruud Lubbers is thus added a negative desire in others to resist the Franco-German steamroller. So deadlock is quite possible. It may also be desirable. Its effect would be to throw the choice forward into the German presidency, which starts next week, obliging Mr Kohl to act as chairman rather than champion. Worthwhile delay He has said he would call an emergency summit at once, but he should think again. Too long a delay would indeed be damaging, given the need for the new president to help choose his colleagues, and for the whole team to secure parliamentary approval, before taking office in January. But a delay until early autumn would be well worthwhile if it were used to make a break with the current mode of selection and open the process to public scrutiny. Existing procedures are little short of scandalous. Governments apparently believe that this important post can best be filled at a private horse-trading session among 12 individuals. In so far as they have allowed the public to know anything at all about their motives, it seems that the nationality of each candidate counts for much more than his personal merits or opinions, even though once chosen he would be expected to forswear all national favouritism. Even more demeaningly, the top executive posts in other international organisations, including some which are far from being in the EU's gift, have been bandied around as bargaining chips, or as consolation prizes for nations which lose out in this unseemly contest. Radical ideas If they were really concerned about the 'democratic deficit', European leaders should allow the president to be elected either by the parliament or directly by the citizens of the Union. But such radical ideas would require treaty revision, and will have to wait at least until 1996. For now, the council should announce its intention of reconvening to make a final choice in, say, late September. It should invite candidates - those already declared and any others who wish to be considered - to submit formal applications by mid-July. These applications should be made public, and should include a statement of the candidate's views on the future of the Union, on the role of the Commission and its president, and on the way in which he, or she, would propose to fill that role. They should be the subject of debate in the European Parliament, in national parliaments and elsewhere. The council should also agree on a voting procedure, which might include an undertaking by all its members to accept the decision of a qualified majority, if unanimity is not achieved on the first one or two ballots; and all of them should promise to make their vote public along with the reasons for it. If the EU's leaders are not prepared to take it even that far in a democratic direction, they should not feign surprise at the growing Euroscepticism, or downright Euro-hostility, of their electorates.</p>

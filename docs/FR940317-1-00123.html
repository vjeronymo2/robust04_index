			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.168 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Form of claim.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Claims personnel will date-stamp, log in and consider as a personnel claim any writing received at a U.S. military establishment if it constitutes a demand for compensation for loss of or damage to personal property. Claims personnel will not return such writing to the claimant without action as ``lacking documentation'' and may only consider it abandoned in accordance with &sect;536.234(a). For claims cognizable under this chapter, a demand need not be for a specified sum of money. However, the claimant must complete and submit DD Form 1842 and DD Form 1844 (List of Property and Claim Analysis Chart) as a condition precedent to payment of the claim. Claimants will be required to complete only one DD Form 1842 and DD Form 1844 and to provide only one copy of supporting documentation. A demand on carrier, warehouse firm, insurer, or other third party is not considered a claim against the United States. Submission of DD Form 1840R (Notice of Loss or Damage) to the claims office does not constitute presentment of a claim. If, however, a claimant alleges that he or she filed a claim, and the evidence shows that within the 2-year period the claimant visited a claims office of one of the Armed Forces with an apparent desire to obtain compensation, it may be presumed in absence of evidence to the contrary, that the claimant, in fact, submitted a claim.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.169 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Presentation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) A claim should, if practicable, be submitted in writing to the claims office serving the Active Army installation where the claimant is stationed, or nearest to the point where the loss or damage occurred, or where investigation of the facts and circumstances can most conveniently be made. ARNG and USAR personnel will not file claims with their unit but with the nearest Active Army installation. If submission in accordance with the foregoing is impracticable under the circumstances, the claim may be submitted in writing to the commander of any installation or establishment of the Armed Forces who will forward the claim to the appropriate Army claims office for processing. To constitute a filing under this regulation, a claim must be presented in writing to an agency of one of the military departments other than the National Guard or a Reserve Component.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The claimant is responsible for substantiating ownership or possession, the fact of loss or damage, and the value of property, especially for expensive items. The claimant is also responsible for promptly discovering and reporting loss whenever failure to do so would prejudice either effective investigation of the claim or effective recovery action from a third party. Failure to do so may result in reduction of the amount allowable or denial of the claim in accordance with &sect;536.181(a).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Evaluation, Adjudication, and Settlement of Claims  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.170 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Policy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) The prompt, fair disposition of claims of soldiers and civilians, consistent with the protection of the interests of the Government, is necessary to maintain morale and to prevent financial hardship. Claims approval and settlement authorities should exercise reasonable discretion in the consideration of claims to achieve this goal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The small claims procedures (subpart B of this part, small claims) applicable to claims that may be settled by payment of $1,000 or less without extensive investigation should be used to the maximum extent feasible. When this procedure is used, every reasonable effort should be made to settle the claim within the shortest possible period, usually one working day. However, the small claims procedure should not be used when additional investigation is necessary to develop the facts required for an informed disposition of the claim regardless of the amount claimed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Within the DA, personnel claims will not be transferred except as authorized by the USARCS or a command claims service. (See DA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraph 2&hyph;55.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) When it is necessary to disapprove a claim or to allow a sum less than the amount claimed, the claimant must be informed either orally or in writing of the factual or legal basis for the decision. The file must reflect that this explanation was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided to the claimant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) When a claimant refuses to provide information concerning private insurance coverage, the JA may assume, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that the claimant had private insurance covering the entire loss and disapprove the claim.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.171 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Preliminary findings required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Prior to allowing or recommending the allowance of compensation for the loss, damage, or destruction of property, the approval or settlement authority will make the following findings:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) The claimant is a proper party claimant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The evidence substantiates the fact of ownership or possession of the personal property involved and the fact of loss, damage, or destruction as alleged.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) The loss, damage, or destruction of the property involved was sustained incident to the claimant's military service or employment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) The type of property claimed and the amount or quantity claimed was reasonable or useful under the attendant circumstances for the claimant to have used or possessed incident to military service or employment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) There is no bar to the allowance of compensation for the type of property involved, or for the type of loss, damage, or destruction providing the basis of the claim.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

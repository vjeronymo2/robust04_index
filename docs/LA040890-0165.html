			<p><P> April 8, 1990, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> IT'S SPRING BREAK; 139 ARRESTED IN PALM SPRINGS  </P> <P> Thousands of vacationing students swarmed into Palm Springs over the weekend,  creating gridlock and a carnival atmosphere along downtown thoroughfares but  sparking no major problems, authorities reported Saturday. Local police,  supported by 60 officers on loan from the Riverside County Sheriff's Department  and the California Highway Patrol, had made 139 arrests and issued 700  citations -- most of them alcohol related -- by nightfall Saturday. "We're  super busy, but all in all it's been a typical spring break," Police Lt. Lee  Weigel said.  </P></p>

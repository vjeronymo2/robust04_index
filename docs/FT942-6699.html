			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: BP BP will be the biggest winner if the US ban on Alaskan oil exports is repealed. Not only is it the largest producer of Alaskan oil, accounting for 220m barrels a year. Unlike Atlantic Richfield, the other main producer, it does not have refineries in California where most Alaskan oil is processed. If the export ban were to go and producers were free to sell where they wished, the fat Californian refining margins would be squeezed. The current regime requires BP and other producers to ship more than a third of output through the Panama Canal to the US Gulf. Demand in California is just not big enough. Repealing the ban would allow them to ship crude to oil-hungry markets in the Far East, particularly Japan. BP would benefit in four ways. First, shipping costs would be roughly 50c-60c a barrel lower because of the shorter distance. Second, the group could obtain 20c-30c more a barrel in the Far East than in the US Gulf. Third, prices for crude shipped to California could rise as producers would be able to divert some of their oil from the state's saturated market. Finally, BP would find it more attractive to develop its untapped Alaskan exploration acreage. The annual boost to BP's earnings from just the first two factors would be about Dollars 70m or nearly 1p a share. The other factors are harder to quantify but would probably double the overall benefit. A change in the law is, of course, not certain. But, with the unions squared and the US Energy Department moving towards lifting the ban, the chances of a repeal look good.</p>

			<p><P> July 31, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> O.C. MAY USE SEWAGE AS BARRIER TO SEAWATER;  </P> <P> CONSERVATION: OFFICIALS PROPOSE TO USE ONLY TREATED WASTE WATER -- INSTEAD OF A  MIXTURE OF IT AND DEEP-WELL WATER -- AS AN UNDERGROUND BARRIER TO SEAWATER.  </P> <P> Orange County water officials want to inject millions of gallons of undiluted  but highly treated sewage into the ground every day to conserve water and stem  the tide of seawater migrating from the ocean.  </P> <P> State water-quality officials commend the Orange County Water District's  proposal as a good way to turn waste into a resource. But health officials are  trying to determine if the waste water might pose a risk to public health if it  flows into underground drinking-water supplies.  </P> <P> For 15 years, the water district has pumped a blend of one-third deep-well  water and two-thirds treated waste water underground as a barrier to seawater  flowing into the county's valuable ground-water basin, which serves 2 million  people. Now it proposes to use only treated waste water, conserving water that  could be used to supply Orange County residents in drought periods.  </P> <P> "After (treatment), the waste water is as clean, if not cleaner, than the  imported water supply we're drinking right now," said James Van Haun, spokesman  for the Orange County Water District.  </P> <P> Currently, up to 15 million gallons of the waste-and-water mix are injected  daily into the ground via 23 wells along Ellis Avenue in Fountain Valley. The  change to straight waste water would save about 5 million gallons of water a  day, enough for 5,000 households per year.  </P> <P> By the year 2000, the amount of treated waste injected would double to 30  million gallons daily.  </P> <P> Before the switch can occur, the regional Santa Ana board of the California  Regional Water Quality Control Board must approve it.  </P> <P> "From a water-quality perspective, we're in favor of the project," said Jerry  Thibeault, executive officer of the regional board.  </P> <P> "It provides a good steady source of supply to stop seawater intrusion, and it  doesn't use water that can be used for domestic supply."  </P> <P> But approval cannot be granted by the regional board unless the state health  department determines that the straight waste water would have no adverse  effects on drinking water. Officials from the two agencies held a joint public  hearing last week, with a final decision expected in October.  </P> <P> "The big question is, if they change their approach, could it have an impact on  public drinking supplies down the road?" said Kurt Berchtold, assistant  executive officer of the regional water board.  </P> <P> The nearest municipal drinking well, in Huntington Beach, is about 1,700 feet  from the nearest injection point, and it would take at least three years,  probably longer, for the reclaimed waste water to flow there, water district  officials said.  </P> <P> The water is purified at Water Factory 21, the district's state-of-the-art  treatment plant in Fountain Valley, considered the most sophisticated in the  world. It uses five treatment processes to remove pollutants from waste water.  </P> <P> State officials said the waste water is so thoroughly treated that it meets  drinking-water standards for toxic pollutants and bacteria.  </P> <P> But health officials worry that small amounts of carbon-based chemicals found  in waste could slowly seep into the basin that supplies drinking water, said  Frank Hamamura, an engineer in the Santa Ana district of the state Department  of Health Services.  </P> <P> The chemicals, types of organic carbons, are poorly understood and in minute  quantities, but they could pose a long-term health threat, he said.  </P> <P> "A decision has not been made yet. We're dealing with some substances that we  don't have much information about yet, and we have to weigh it to see if this  is really a health concern or not," he said.  </P> <P> Hamamura said the treatment removes other contaminants in sewage, including  bacteria and viruses.  </P> <P> Nineteen monitoring wells in the injection area are tested for contaminants.  Also, the county's drinking-water wells are tested regularly, with about 12,000  samples taken annually.  </P> <P> Van Haun said 15 years of tests on Water Factory 21's reclaimed waste water  have not detected viruses or bacteria. He added that if the project is  approved, the district would start extra monitoring for more contaminants.  </P> <P> "Our sense is that we'll obtain approval with a few stipulations," he said.  </P> <P> The reason that water district officials want to stop blending the waste water  with deep-well water is that they found a way to start using that water for  drinking supplies.  </P> <P> Until now, the deep water had an unpalatable brown color, but now the water  agency has come up with a way to remove the color and make it a usable supply.  Every drop counts, they say, especially because the state is facing a 4-year  drought.  </P> <P> "We want to preserve it now, because it will provide a very viable water source  here in the near future," Van Haun said.  </P> <P> Water officials said the seawater barrier project is extremely important. If  saltwater got into the ground-water basin, it would render the underground  drinking supply useless.  </P> <P> Orange County's huge underground lake, which contains millions of gallons of  water, is a rare, invaluable resource. It makes the county less vulnerable to  drought than most of Southern California, which relies more heavily on  expensive water imported from the drought-plagued Sierra Nevada.  </P> <P> Orange County's state legislative delegation has supported the proposal to stop  the blending.  </P> <P> In a letter to the water board, the 13 legislators commended the district for  its exemplary record in water quality and said the change "will not result in a  relaxation of existing water-quality standards" and will save water, "which is  critically important during times of drought."  </P> <P> The Orange County Water District is known internationally for its innovative,  advanced ways of protecting ground water and tapping into it for drinking  supplies.  </P> <P> "It is a first-class organization, and they're doing a real good job of  monitoring the ground-water basin. That gives us more confidence about this  proposal," Thibeault said.  </P> <P> Two-thirds of the water consumed in the northern half of Orange County comes  from the ground-water basin. Underground water from Irvine south is not used  for drinking supplies, mostly because it is too salty.  </P></p>

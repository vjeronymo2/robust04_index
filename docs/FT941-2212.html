			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / UK Company News: CrestaCare Pounds 341,000 in the black CrestaCare, the nursing home operator, swung from losses of Pounds 1.58m to pre-tax profits of Pounds 341,000 in 1993 in spite of the upheavals of a new management team, a withdrawal from property activities, a Pounds 33.3m share placing and a number of acquisitions. Turnover was Pounds 30.8m, against Pounds 25.9m. Mr Andrew Taee, chief executive since March last year, said the group was now in shape and he predicted that it 'will bloom' in 1994. A final dividend of 0.5p (0.4p) is proposed to give a total of 0.75p (0.5p). Profits were hit by a Pounds 2.35m loss on property, including a Pounds 359,000 provision against the sheltered housing side. The property activities were cut from Pounds 9.4m to Pounds 600,000 over the year through sales and provisions. The nursing home division increased turnover from Pounds 17.3m to Pounds 23.2m, helped by a 38 per cent increase in bed numbers to 2,142. The new community care legislation had reduced occupancy rates to 92.2 per cent, but had since recovered to 93 per cent. Nursing home operating profits rose from Pounds 4.16m to Pounds 5.12m, before exceptional charges of Pounds 385,000 covering compensation for the former chief executive and relocation costs for Mr Taee. Interest costs were Pounds 2.05m (Pounds 2.88m). Gearing at the year end was 17.5 per cent, but the group has Pounds 22m of fixed rate debt paying 9.4 per cent, and cash on deposit earning a lower return. Mr Taee said he could spend Pounds 35m taking gearing to about 60 per cent. Beyond that he aimed to use sale and leaseback deals to fund expansion rather than go to shareholders. He said the group was looking at all areas of long-term health care from chronically sick children to elderly mentally ill. A Pounds 554,000 tax charge left losses per share of 0.2p (1.9p) and a retained loss of Pounds 1.27m (Pounds 2m).</p>

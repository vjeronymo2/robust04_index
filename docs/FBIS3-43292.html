Zairian intellectuals in  Brussels believe that President Mobutu is achieving exactly what  he set out to achieve. His country is in a complete economic  and social mess, and the hope of democratic reform is further  off than ever.    The "New Zaire" (NZ) which was introduced on 21 October 1993  by the pro-Mobutu government of Faustin Birundwa is visibly  collapsing. The original exchange rate of three NZ for one  dollar had climbed to 37 NZ to the dollar by last weekend. On  the black market in Kinshasa, people were paying as much as 110  NZ last Friday. In addition, the introduction of the NZ has met  with political opposition. This is strongest in East Kasai --  where prime minister Etienne Tshisekedi comes from -- and in the  Kivu province. On 29 November clashes with the military in  Kananga left at least seven dead.    As a deterrent, President Mobutu had already dispatched his  DSP [Special Presidential Division] to the Mbuji-Mayi diamond  center. But the dealers are still refusing to accept the NZ.  Any firm action by the DSP seems out of the question for the  moment as the population is apparently well armed. Today,  however, the presidential guard will enforce a total curfew and  carry out large- scale house searches.    In Bukavu the border with Rwanda has been closed for several  days now. The shortages of goods had prompted many people to  seek out supplies across the border. The Zairian government  will not tolerate this and the military are firing mercilessly  at anyone who infringes the ban.    In the New Year, the thoughts of many Zairians are returning  to the notorious 4 January 1959. In the then Leopoldstad, the  troops of General Janssens put down the sudden call for  "Dipenda" with brutal violence. The result was a couple of  hundred dead and at least as many wounded. But in just one day  independence was within reach.    Thirty-five years later the Zairians are once again calling  for dignity and freedom. The failure of monetary reform and of  two months of political negotiations have robbed them of their  last grain of hope for improvement in a situation which becomes  increasingly hopeless by the day. No end is yet in sight to the  oppression and the exploitation.</p>

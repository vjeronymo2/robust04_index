			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 5 KYODO -- Topics on the agenda at the  Group of Seven (G-7) summit of industrialized nations include  situations in the former Yugoslavia and the Middle East,  assistance needs of South Africa and Ukraine and the North  Korean nuclear issue, government sources said Sunday.    Representatives of the G-7 nations -- Britain, Canada,  France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States -- worked  out an agenda of political dialogue for the July 8-10 meeting in  Naples, Italy, the sources said.    Unlike previous G-7 summits, they said, the Naples summit  will not issue a political declaration.    Instead, they will merely issue a chairman's declaration, in  view of Russia's formal participation for the first time.    At previous summits, Kremlin leaders were invited to join  their G-7 counterparts for a special session outside the  framework of the actual summit.    Russia's participation in the G-7 discussion on the former  Yugoslavia will be especially meaningful, considering the  country's influence over fellow Slavs in Serbia.    The sources said Japan, which has not sent personnel to join  the United Nations Protection Force (Unprofor) in the former  Yugoslavia, will call for continued efforts to keep the conflict  in Bosnia- Herzegovina from spreading.    Japan will convey its resolve to extend assistance to  surrounding countries such as Macedonia to consolidate stability  there, as well as post-conflict reconstruction assistance to  other parts of the former Yugoslavia, they said.</p>

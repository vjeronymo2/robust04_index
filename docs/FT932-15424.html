			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / Georgia, Ukraine to hold talks: Shevardnadze wants counterweight to 'third force' GEORGIAN leader Eduard Shevardnadze arrived in Ukraine yesterday for talks aimed at forging a joint political front against Russia, Reuter reports from Kiev. Mr Shevardnadze, who has accused Russia of aiding separatists in Georgia's Black Sea region of Abkhazia, headed straight for talks with Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk after flying in. 'This is the beginning of the construction of new relations between independent states,' he told reporters. 'There are of course high hopes.' The Georgian leader, a former Soviet foreign minister, set the tone for discussions in a weekend interview, saying Georgia and Ukraine had a joint interest in acting as a counterweight to an unnamed 'third force'. 'We were forced into this war. Separatism has taken root over several decades thanks to the special interests of a third force,' he said in an interview with Georgian television. 'I believe Ukraine understands full well this third force is interested in destabilising not only Georgia.' Georgia says the continued presence of Russian troops on its territory is hindering a settlement in Abkhazia, where hundreds have been killed in the past eight months. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Ukraine has been locked in disputes with Russia on issues ranging from ownership of the Black Sea fleet to the future of Ukraine's share of the Soviet nuclear arsenal and repayment of Soviet debt. Kiev, generally suspicious of its northern neighbour after three centuries of Moscow rule, has accused the Kremlin of high-handedness and intimidation in its dealings with Ukraine. Mr Shevardnadze and Mr Kravchuk are due to sign about 20 documents, including a treaty on friendship and co-operation, which the Georgian leader said could extend to 'mutual assistance'. 'I think this is indisputably the correct approach. Our national interests, our strategic interests coincide fully. We can in real terms speak about friendship and mutual assistance,' Mr Shevardnadze said. A senior adviser to Mr Kravchuk also said the visit could help combat undue outside influence on both countries. Mr Kravchuk yesterday sacked the head of the Kiev city administration, who has often been compared to Russian President Boris Yeltsin for his rebellious, populist campaigns against authority. Mr Kravchuk formally dismissed Mr Ivan Saliy for his refusal to move the administration out of its imposing headquarters to make way for the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry. The two men had clashed repeatedly on how the city of 2.5m was run.</p>

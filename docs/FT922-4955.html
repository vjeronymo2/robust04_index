			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / Business and the Environment: Beautiful face, polluted soul  -Rio de Janeiro's once-sparkling bay is turning into a cesspool. Christina Lamb examines a plan to restore its natural splendour Entering the bay of Rio de Janeiro with its long sweeps of golden sand backed by strangely shaped granite peaks must feature among the most spectacular sights in the world. Visitors arriving for the Earth Summit will no doubt be as impressed as the bay's first tourist, Amerigo Vespucci, the Italian navigator, back in 1502. But while Vespucci found a sparkling island-strewn bay surrounded by a rainforest inhabited by a few thousand Indians, today's visitors may notice a slightly rank smell and find the beaches less than appealing for swimming. The 380 sq km bay, known as Guanabara, or 'arm of the sea', is dying as a result of large quantities of litter and untreated sewage thrown into it each day by an ever-swelling population. In the last 20 years the number of fish has been reduced by 90 per cent and its heavily polluted waters provide a striking symbol of the effect of poverty and development on the environment - the heart of the Earth Summit debate. The Guanabara Bay is today a huge rubbish dump into which 9m people throw 470 tonnes of untreated sewage and 5,500 tonnes of litter each day. This is joined by 70 tonnes of effluent from 6,000 industries and nine tonnes of oil from two refineries. Landfills to construct roads to cope with the influx of migrants from Brazil's drought-stricken northeast has reduced the number of islands from 43 to four. So serious is the situation that the financially pressed Rio authorities have decided that the problem can no longer be ignored. This week a loan will be signed with the Japanese Overseas Export Credit Fund (OECF) and a pledge given from the Inter-American Development Bank (IBD) for a Dollars 777m (Pounds 430m) project aimed at halting the pollution and reducing by 30 per cent the quantity of untreated sewage in the bay. This will form the initial part of a Dollars 4bn programme to restore the bay which it is hoped will then serve as a model for other Latin American cities located on estuaries. Some 12 technicians from the Japanese International Co-operation Agency (Jica) are already in Rio analysing the water. From their studies they will create mathematical simulations of its hydrodynamic qualities such as the currents and how long water is retained. This will then be developed into a masterplan for the next 10 years. Japanese assistance will be based on experience of cleaning the Bay of Tokyo  -which is four times larger and took 30 years to restore. 'When we started depolluting Tokyo's bay conditions were similar. The number of fish had been greatly reduced and no one could enter the water,' says Senro Imai from Jica. Rio, he says, will be easier in that the number of inhabitants and industries are fewer but the water is shallower. Moreover, Imai points out: 'We did not throw untreated sewage in our bay. Our problem was more with industrial effluent which is easier to control.' The combination of organic material such as sewage and litter collected in the Rio bay has led to an excess of nutrients which accelerates the growth of algae and leads to an overconsumption of oxygen, killing off higher organisms. 'The situation is really worrying. You can sense the bad smell as you go past. Recuperation will bring immense benefits as it did to Tokyo such as recovery of fishes and leisure activities boosting the economy,' says Imai. The clean-up of Guanabara Bay is the biggest environmental project ever undertaken in Rio. The first stage will comprise Dollars 350m from the IBD, Dollars 248m from the OECF and Dollars 179m from the state authorities. Contracts for the large number of works involved will be open to international bidding and the Rio authorities hope to benefit from some transfer of technology. The project has five main components: A series of sanitation works to improve sewage collection and treatment as well as water distribution. Currently, around half the people living in the bay area do not have sewage facilities while around half of what is collected is not treated. These services will be extended while water distribution will be improved. 'Even though we have plenty of potable water, currently we suffer losses of 50 per cent of the water in distribution because of the age of the system and the various leaks and holes that have developed,' explains Manoel Sanches, head of the Guanabara Bay project. Drainage. The 35 rivers flowing into the bay start from sharp inclines. This means that as they near the plains around the bay they spread easily. When it rains heavily this provokes violent floods in the city of Rio and landslides in the slums or favelas in which hundreds of people have died in recent years. Solid waste or litter. The litter thrown into rivers by favela populations worsens the drainage and flooding problem. This project plans to collect litter to prevent it going into rivers. A complementary environment programme of monitoring and environmental education. Digital mapping to chart the bay through aerial and satellite photos. The information will be stored on computer in order to study urban occupation and the use of public services, and to plan the use of land for agriculture, urban population or forest regeneration. Sanches says this has a twofold value: 'It will enable us to prepare plans for providing drainage, transport and housing but will also be of immense benefit in terms of tax collection because we can detect where people are using services and not paying.' This project began one year ago and Sanches says it has already resulted in a 25 per cent - or Dollars 150m - increase in revenue collection. 'This will give financial viability to the project. The aim is for the programme to be self-financing,' he stresses. In planning the depollution programme the populist state government has come across a problem which Sanches describes as a 'symbolic paradox between development and environment' and which is at the crux of current debate between north and south. 'If you extend urban services such as sewage collection you improve the quality of life for people who currently throw their sewage into the ditches in front of their houses. 'But at the same time you increase the amount of organic material thrown into the bay, and thus pollution, because we cannot afford to treat it. The alternative is to increase treatment of that already collected and not extend collection services,' he explains. 'The problem is that resources are always scarce and environmental demands are always limitless. For the time being we have to make a choice between increasing the network which is politically more acceptable or increasing the treatment of what we already collect, which is better from the environmental standpoint. The challenge is to find an equilibrium.' Within this Dollars 4bn programme the aim is to increase both sewage collection and treatment to avoid further pollution and to reduce the amount of untreated material entering by almost a third. But to completely recuperate the bay would, says Sanches, take far more. 'Realistically we are probably never again going to have dolphins playing,' says Roberto D'Avila, the state environment secretary. The project is particularly important in Brazil because 70 per cent of the country's population is concentrated in coastal areas and only two of its 10 big metropolitan regions are inland. D'Avila is confident that it can result in social and environmental benefit for the area and political benefit for the state government: 'I see this as a very symbolic project which reunites urban development and social service, environmental protection and transfer of technology. It is the perfect example of the Earth Summit.'</p>

			<p>930607 FT  07 JUN 93 / International Bonds: Cemex issue paves way for Latin American groups WHEN Cementos Mexicanos, Mexico's large cement company, issued Dollars 1bn of bonds in the Euromarket last month, several records were set. Cemex became the first fully Latin American company to offer Dollars 1bn of bonds in a single bite, and the first to obtain investment grade status for its bonds from a rating agency, albeit from the relatively low-profile Duff &amp; Phelps. The transaction, which was priced at 370 basis points over the comparable US Treasury yield and met heavy demand, represents a new acceptance of Latin American companies in international markets and paves the way for more issues. Last week, the Chilean company Celulosa Arauco y Constitucion issued Mexico's first straight bond, for Dollars 150m, at just 210 basis points over US Treasury - the tightest yield spread to date for a Latin American company. Both these deals raised the question of the risk of buying foreign-currency bonds from Latin American companies that in the past have suffered from steep currency devaluations. While Latin American names are broadly viewed as improving credits, there is a danger that the tightening of spreads and the supply of paper could run ahead of their growing credit strength. Both Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's, the two main US rating agencies, continue to grade Mexican foreign currency sovereign bonds as speculative (unlike Chilean bonds). Under rating agencies' rules, the grade on a country's sovereign bond acts as an effective ceiling for that of its corporate bonds. Since Duff &amp; Phelps had given Mexican sovereign bonds investment grade last month, Cemex approached the agency for investment grade status. Some US institutions, prohibited from buying speculative grade bonds, were therefore able to take up the Cemex bonds, said JP Morgan, who jointly managed the offering. For many US investors, this issue was the first Mexican offering they had bought. However, Mr Philip Bates, managing director at S&amp;P, emphasised that obtaining investment grade from Duff &amp; Phelps is not the same as from S&amp;P or Moody's, both of which are widely used by investors internationally. He said it was reasonable to assume that Mexico's sovereign rating from S&amp;P would remain speculative this year. 'Some people would like to pretend the 1980s did not exist, but they did,' said Mr William Chambers, director of S&amp;P, noting that not long ago Mexico's economic policy was in disarray and the country defaulted on its foreign bank debt. While current economic policy is viewed positively, uncertainty over passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement, the succession to President Carlos Salinas, and a weak US economy could yet cause problems, the agency argues. S&amp;P, and more so Moody's, remains worried about Mexico's current account deficit which, at 7 per cent of GDP last year, is 'pushing the limit of sustainability'. The short maturity of capital that finances the deficit, much of which is in 28-day government paper, also remains a concern. Such conservatism draws fire from the Wall Street banks, such as Salomon Brothers, that are keen to push Mexican bonds. In a recent report Salomon concluded that Mexico was virtually investment grade, having proved its determination and skill in handling a variety of political and economic challenges during 1992. Salomon is particularly scornful of Moody's claim that Mexico's political institutions may be unable to manage the process of economic change, or that social inequalities could threaten political stability. 'The inequality in Mexico, while serious, can be compared structurally with that in the US,' concluded Salomon Brothers. JP Morgan said the sovereign ceiling for corporate bonds 'creates an inefficiency', since a company such as Cemex might be investment grade were it resident in an investment grade country. 'You have to compare Cemex against other multinationals and not against other Mexican companies,' said JP Morgan. 'It is a company with margins, cash flow, and is diversified (geographically).' S&amp;P is more conservative, pointing out, in a recent report, the dangers of buying Latin American corporate bonds, aside from country risk and devaluation concerns. Given the rapid opening to international markets, many Latin American companies face a more competitive environment than they did a few years ago, on which credit history is often based. Reporting requirements and accounting standards are also more lax in Latin America than in the US, with companies often not breaking down costs and revenues by division. Ownership of companies is generally much more concentrated than in the US, making sudden shifts in strategy more possible. About 18 months ago, a few controlling shareholders in Grupo Visa, which controls the Mexican beverage company Femsa, financed their Dollars 2.55bn purchase of Bancomer by increasing debt in Femsa. In a company with more diversified ownership, it is unlikely that Femsa would have been used to finance the purchase of a bank. While recognising such risks, some Wall Street bankers argue that the returns more than justify the extra risks of buying these bonds.</p>

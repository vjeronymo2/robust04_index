			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report over video of test flight of new fighter aircraft; </F> from the "Polygon" program]    [Text] [Unidentified correspondent over video of fighter  aircraft on tarmac and taking off] No awesome name has yet been  thought up for this aircraft. Its specifications remain secret  for the time being, but even the first test flight has made it  clear that what we see here is the super-fighter of the 21st  century. In terms of flight specifications this fighter has no  parallel in aviation history. Russian scientists and military  people believe that this super-fighter will largely determine  the development of world aircraft building.    It is amazing that this machine has appeared now, during a  period of protracted economic crisis, Deputy Defense Minister  Andrey Kokoshin and Russian Air Force Commander in Chief Petr  Deynekin stressed in our interview.    [Kokoshin] The first flight has been very successful. I  consider this an important milestone in the emergence of  essentially a new-generation aircraft.    [Deynekin] I believe that we can confidently and objectively  claim today that Russia always had, has, and will continue to  have wings.</p>

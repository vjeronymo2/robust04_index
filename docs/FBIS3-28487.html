Calling attention to the exposure of the fact that Chon  Kyong-hwan grabbed by forcible means more than 122,000 phyong  (one phyong equals six feet square) of land around Yongjongdo,  Inchon city, the ownership of which he claimed and filed a suit  for it, the deputy spokesman said the money he paid in buying  the vast tract of land must be an ill-gotten money.    And he urged an immediate investigation into all the  injustices committed by Chon Kyong-hwan in-mobilizing  "government officials" in the forcible purchase of the land.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Will We Be Reading Newspapers?"] </F>   [Text] The first business days of the new year were marked  by numerous calls to the editorial office from both our readers  and subscribers to various Moscow publications. All of them were  concerned about the same issue--will they receive the newspapers  to which they have subscribed in the current year, or does an  information vacuum lie in store for them yet again?    The editorial office has already informed our readers about  the reasons for the irregular publication of VYSHKA in the last  two months of last year. The lack of special plates for  newspaper printing at the "Azerbaijan" publishing house is the  reason. The management of "Azerbaijan" has now promised to  ensure the publication of our newspaper once a week--on  Saturday. The editorial office itself "arranged" the plates for  today's issue. We understand that this report cannot make our  readers happy in any way. However, such is the situation.    As far as the Moscow publication to which the residents of  our republic have subscribed, the situation is not particularly  happy, either. The press distribution company Gasid has informed  us that they have still been unable to transfer to Moscow the  funds received for subscriptions. However, Moscow has promised  to send publications printed there to subscribers, so to say, on  credit in January. As for other newspapers that should be  printed at the printing plant of the "Azerbaijan" publishing  house, the situation is unclear for now, because of a shortage  of the necessary quantity of the already mentioned plates.</p>

			<p><P> July 29, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: FORMER AZTEC QUARTERBACK BARRICK WILL PLAY FOR  PALOMAR  </P> <P> Scott Barrick, who quit the San Diego State University football team before  spring practice in April, will play for Palomar College this fall.  </P> <P> Barrick, a 1987 Fallbrook High School graduate, said he was contacted Wednesday  evening by Palomar Coach Tom Craft. The two met Thursday, and Barrick will be  on the field when Palomar begins practice Tuesday.  </P> <P> "I've been working out with friends who I played high school football with, but  I was working out with no purpose other than to keep in shape," Barrick said.  "They were all getting ready for the season, and I missed that."  </P> <P> Barrick, 6-feet-3, 205-pounds, started SDSU's final four games last fall as a  redshirt freshman. He said he will continue to attend classes at SDSU and take  enough hours at Palomar to keep him eligible to play football.  </P> <P> Haywood Mathis and Paul Victoria, two freshman linebackers who were redshirted  last season, will not return to San Diego State University this fall because of  academic difficulties, according to John Rosenthal, SDSU sports information  director.  </P> <P> Mathis will enroll at Grossmont College.  </P> <P> BASKETBALL  </P> <P> The Primetime 3-on-3 USA basketball tour will be held Aug. 5 and 6 outside of  the San Diego County Administrative building on the Embarcadero. The cost is  $60 per four-person team, $50 if all four players are under 16. Each  participant will receive a ticket to the Seagram's Coolers All-Star Basketball  game Aug. 8 at the San Diego Sports Arena. In addition to the 3-on-3  tournament, players will be able to participate in a slam-dunk contest, a free  throw contest and a three-point shot competition. For information call  1-800-888-DUNK.  </P> <P> SOFTBALL  </P> <P> Lucy Casarez of Bonita had RBI singles in the third and fifth innings as the  West defeated the North, 5-0, to win the bronze medal in the U.S. Olympic  Festival women's fast-pitch softball competition at Oklahoma City. The game was  played before a sellout crowd of more than 2,000 at ASA Hall of Fame Stadium.  </P></p>

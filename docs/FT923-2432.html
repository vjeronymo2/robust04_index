			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / UK Company News: James Finlay declines to Pounds 3.71m Lower pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.71m, against Pounds 5.14m, were announced by James Finlay, the overseas trading and financial services group, for the half year to June 30. The result last time included a gain of Pounds 1.3m from the sale of the Tower Bridge property. As before, the results excluded the plantation interests in Bangladesh as only a small proportion of the crop is sold by June, but they included the Kenyan tea interests. The company said that overall profits in Kenya were likely to be better than last year. The loss on the Bangladeshi tea operations in 1991 was substantial but a break-even position was expected for 1992. Turnover fell to Pounds 70.7m (Pounds 74.2m). Earnings per share dropped by 1p to 1.9p and an unchanged interim dividend of 2p is declared.</p>

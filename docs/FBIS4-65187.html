			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Jesus Duva report: "Garzon: `Gonzalez Used Me as a Pawn'"] </F>   [Excerpt] Madrid -- Former Secretary of State for the  National Plan on Drugs, Baltasar Garzon, yesterday confessed to  feeling betrayed by Felipe Gonzalez, who he accused of viewing  his recruitment as an "electoral stratagem." "When, a year ago,  I decided to join the PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party]  electoral list as an independent, I did so absolutely convinced  that I could contribute to the task of regenerating Spanish  politics," he explained. "Perhaps that was my first mistake.  Many people said that I was being used to present an image --  that of the struggle against corruption; and now I must largely  agree that they were right," he added. Garzon, who confirmed  that he is also giving up his seat as a deputy, harshly attacked  the government and reiterated his conviction that he had been  used as "a pawn."    Garzon, who will return to the National High Court,  expressed  regret that Gonzalez used him by announcing that he would give  him the chairmanship of a committee to investigate corruption.  He said that his "ambition" was fulfilled with his post in the  struggle against drugs, and that he was "comfortable" at the  Interior Ministry during Antoni Asuncion's term.    "The proliferation of corruption scandals and the prime  minister's passive attitude, with the consequent tension in  society, which I believe is justified, caused me to consider the  need to resign and not to be a party, even through omission or  silence, to that situation," the former number two at the  Interior Ministry stated. He sent a letter to Gonzalez 18  April, telling him that unless corruption was tackled thoroughly  -- and not through "mere posturing" -- he would resign before 25  April.    The 38-year-old judge demanded of the prime minister that  the  change of attitude which he was demanding be made clear in the  19 April state of the nation debate. Gonzalez asked him to wait  to talk with him after the debate, and this took place at the  Moncloa Palace on 22 April. The head of government asked him  for time to adopt measures and for his cooperation against  corruption. "Neither before nor after did he use it, or give me  the means to carry it out," the judge asserted.    In the state of the nation debate, Garzon was disappointed  with respect to the committee on the Filesa affair, and clashed  harshly with his parliamentary group and with Justice Minister  Juan Alberto Belloch. He said of the latter's conduct that it  has left him with "a very bitter and disappointing, albeit  expected, taste."  <H5>  Second Letter to Gonzalez </H5>   In a second letter to the head of government, dated 25  April,  the judge accepted the latter's request for cooperation. "That  was my second mistake. Since I resigned later, people have  pettily and maliciously sought to infer that my resignation was  due to other reasons."    Garzon complained that he was not consulted about the merger  of the Interior and Justice Ministries, which he opposed when he  spoke with Gonzalez on 4 May, and the latter explained this plan  to him "in passing." "This lack of consideration for what I  might think and the fact that I was dispensed with in the  struggle against corruption made me see that I was being counted  on for nothing; that I had lost the prime minister's confidence  for that task and that he did not trust me."    The former deputy showed himself especially pained by new  Justice and Interior Minister Juan Alberto Belloch's way of  dispensing with him from the outset: "This precipitated my  resignation and its being tendered immediately, in view of the  obvious invitation to do so. There remained no reason for  postponing a resignation which I had announced 20 days earlier.  All they wanted was to to gain time in order to find a solution  which would end my presence in the government," he added.    The judge asserted that he would not have given up his seat  if he had only had a confrontation with the minister or felt  "disappointed" at not being a minister. "I have resigned  because I believe that I do not have the prime minister's  confidence. Therefore I cannot continue to support from my seat  the government or its prime minister, who has preferred to  dispense with me," he explained.    Garzon expressed his confidence that his relationship with  the government from his position as a judge will be "good," and  that the government will cooperate with him in the eradication  of corruption.    Much of the statement by the former secretary of state for  the National Plan on Drugs was devoted to corruption, against  which, according to him, "firm and surgical measures," which he  has not seen so far, are necessary. He described as  "short-term" the measures adopted by the government, and  emphasized that a single case of corruption can bring down a  government.    "I am convinced," he stated at another point, "that an  attempt will be made to combat corruption, but they do not wish  to count on me. With respect to political responsibilities,  some have yet to come. So it should be. For instance, the  resignation of the state attorney general occurs to me."  Garzon, who suspects that he could have "some difficulties  henceforth" in carrying through his ideas, showed himself in  favor of Eligio Hernandez' replacement and of his successor's  being given "greater guarantees of independence."  <H5>  Government's Response </H5>   Miguel Gil, secretary general for the government  spokesperson, showed himself opposed to the former deputy's  assertions that Felipe Gonzalez has a passive attitude to  corruption. "The government is acting with determination,  firmness, and vigor in the struggle against corruption, and is  also backing up that determination with deeds, decisions, and  practical measures," he said.    During his appearance, Garzon came out in favor of setting  up  specialized police units against corruption, coordinated by the  Interior Ministry. According to him, the measures adopted by  parliament, "although abundant," are no good for tackling the  cases which have proliferated, and so "rapid, but investigatory,  procedures should be established."

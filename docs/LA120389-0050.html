			<p><P> December 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PALESTINIAN GROUP PROTESTS USE OF 'NAZI' LABEL  </P> <P> So, actor James Woods calls protesters of Yitzhak Shamir's policies towards  Palestinians "Nazis," and receives cheers from the 1,000 guests at the Simon  Wiesenthal Center's national tribute dinner. How sad and ironic that supporters  of a Museum of Tolerance would respond enthusiastically to such an inaccurate  classification by Woods. Such statements do nothing but add fuel to the fire of  an already volatile situation. It's unfortunate that such a fine actor cannot  use a podium more constructively.  </P> <P> LAWRENCE GALIZIO, Bel-Air  </P></p>

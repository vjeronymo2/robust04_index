			<p>930722 FT  22 JUL 93 / Observer: Copybook case 'Well-briefed' badly understates the case of a candidate sitting one of the papers in the Law Society final examinations held in Leicester. Alerted by the rustling that accompanied his movements, the invigilators discovered he had no fewer than 32 sheets of closely written notes stuffed up his jumper. Other cribs were found secreted elsewhere on his person and in his pencil case. The subject of the paper he was sitting? One of the most common offences for which solicitors are struck off the register: mishandling of accounts.</p>

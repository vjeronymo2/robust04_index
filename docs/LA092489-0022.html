			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POISON  </P> <P> Whereas "Poison Is My Profession," by Gene Stone (Aug. 6), indicates that only  six toxicologists practice in Los Angeles, this figure surely applies only to  medical doctors specializing in poisons and not to toxicologists in general.  The California Assn. of Toxicologists, for example, has more than 100 members  in the Los Angeles area alone and includes forensic, clinical, environmental,  analytical and genetic toxicologists. We've had a hard enough time being  understood since "Quincy" introduced our field to TV viewers; we would welcome  not being written nearly out of existence.  </P> <P> BLYTHE OLSON, Pasadena  </P></p>

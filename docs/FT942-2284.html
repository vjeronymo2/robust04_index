			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / World Bond Markets: London There seems little in prospect this week to help Britain's confused and uncertain gilts market recover its poise against a background of weak bond markets world-wide. In the face of investor reluctance to buy fixed-coupon bonds, the Bank of England played safe on Friday by announcing the auction on June 29 of floating-rate gilts due 1999. However, instead of welcoming the announcement as a step to protect the fixed-interest gilts market from further supply, the market slid sharply on the belief that the decision highlighted low confidence in conventional gilts. With few domestic economic indicators due this week, today's broad money and M4 lending figures for May will be scrutinised for inflationary implications. The best that can be said is that they should cause little concern if they turn out close to the consensus forecasts of 5.8 per cent annual growth for M4 and Pounds 1.9bn for bank and building society lending. Following last week's warning from Mr Eddie George, the Bank of England governor, of higher interest rates at some point in the future, it will be a big surprise if Wednesday's minutes of his May 4 monetary meeting with Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, do not chronicle the end of the 'bias towards easing' in monetary policy.</p>

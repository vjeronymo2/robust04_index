			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / South Africa poised to close deal on constitution SOUTH AFRICA was last night on the verge of majority rule as democracy negotiators put the finishing touches to a constitution which will end 350 years of white minority oppression and give blacks the vote for the first time in history. By late last night, weary negotiators had reached agreement on all but a few points of the historic 158-page constitution, the fruit of years of negotiation. The process was set in train when government ministers met Mr Nelson Mandela, leader of the African National Congress, while he was still serving a 27-year prison term for opposing the racist state. The constitution, which will remain in force for up to five years, is based on traditional western values which contrast sharply with apartheid, one of the most repressive regimes in history. It guarantees multiparty democracy, equality before the law, fundamental human rights and freedoms, an independent judiciary, and a free press. Mr Matthew Phosa, the ANC's constitutional negotiator, said the 21 parties meeting last night were 'digging the grave for apartheid'. Mr Roelf Meyer, the government's chief negotiator, shocked delegates to the negotiating council when he announced that the government had agreed to a very weak form of multiracial power sharing, a capitulation by the ruling National party. All parties with more than 5 per cent of the vote will be granted a seat in cabinet in a government of national unity, with two deputy presidents to be chosen from the two top parties. The president, who is likely to be Mr Mandela, will be elected by the national assembly. The president will try to take decisions by consensus, but he will have the final say where this is not possible. But the new constitution has powerful opponents, among them the mainly Zulu Inkatha Freedom party of Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi and the white right wing, led by retired army general Constand Viljoen. Together, they form the so-called 'Freedom Alliance' of rightwing parties which poses a substantial threat to the stability of the government which will emerge after elections on April 27 next year. Mr FW de Klerk, the president, has left open the possibility that the Freedom Alliance may ratify the constitution after it has been adopted by the other 21 parties, but this seemed increasingly unlikely. Concessions were made to the alliance in last night's debate, including allowing regions to write their own constitutions and requiring a two-thirds majority of the regional house of assembly, the senate, to change the powers of regions. But these did not appear sufficient to bring the Alliance back on board. With a low level civil war already raging in Natal province between Inkatha and the ANC, and with the right wing heavily armed and well trained, the two could prevent elections altogether unless they are accommodated.

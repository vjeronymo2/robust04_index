			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / International Company News: Credit Lyonnais chairman confirms talk of resignation MR JEAN-YVES Haberer, chairman of Credit Lyonnais, the troubled French bank, yesterday confirmed speculation that he was considering leaving the bank for a new post in the financial sector. He warned that the loss-making group would not be ready for privatisation for two years. The chairman's comments, made shortly after he announced an interim net loss of FFr1.05bn (Dollars 185.2m) against a net profit of FFr119m in the first half of 1992, follows weeks of speculation about his position at Credit Lyonnais. Mr Haberer, who has pursued a controversial expansion strategy in his five years as chairman, said he had been 'sounded out about another post'. However, he was not sure whether he was the only candidate. 'I'm thinking about it,' he said. The French press recently tipped Mr Haberer as a likely successor to Mr Yves Lyon-Caen as chairman of the Credit National banking group. Mr Jean Peyrelevade, chairman of the Union des Assurances de Paris insurance group, has been mooted as the next chairman of Credit Lyonnais. France's new centre-right government has already appointed Mr Michel Pebereau as chairman of Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP), the other leading state-controlled French bank, to orchestrate its share sale this autumn. Credit Lyonnais is scheduled for sale later in the privatisation programme. However, Mr Haberer yesterday said Credit Lyonnais needed 'to improve its financial position' before it would be suitable for sale to the private sector. The group, which last year fell into the red with a net loss of FFr1.8bn, has been badly affected by the French recession. It has made heavy writedowns on the bad loans left by Mr Haberer's aggressive lending policy. Despite the sluggish state of the banking market, Credit Lyonnais raised net banking income to FFr27.71bn at the interim stage this year from FFr24.45bn. Operating costs and depreciation, however, rose to FFr20.74bn from FFr17.76bn, and the group was forced to increase net provisions to FFr7.33bn from FFr6.26bn. Mr Francois Gilles, managing director, said Credit Lyonnais expected to maintain high provisions on its corporate loans during the second half of the year. However, he was confident of an improvement in the second half due to lower operating expenses and anticipated cuts in short-term interest rates, particularly in France.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Dear friends: Today, 30 May, is the fourth working  day of the Ninth National Assembly. In the morning, the  deputies broke into groups and discussed the draft law on taxes  levied on the transfer of rights on land use. In these group  discussions, they also offered views on the draft regulation on  rights and obligations of organizations over their granted and  rented land and the draft regulation on rights and obligations  of foreign individuals and organizations over their rented land  in Vietnam.    In the afternoon, the National Assembly held a plenary  session in the conference hall under the direction of National  Assembly Vice Chairman Nguyen Ha Phan to discuss the draft law  on taxes levied on the transfer of rights on land use. The  draft law consists of six chapters with 26 articles.    As of noon, the National Assembly Secretariat received 29  reports on the discussion of the draft law on taxes levied on  the transfer of rights on land use held by all the groups.    In the afternoon, they took turns to present their views on  the draft law. All of them agreed that it is necessary to  promulgate a law on taxes levied on the transfer of rights on  land use in order to improve land management, strictly implement  the law on land promulgated on 15 October 1993, and increase  revenue for the state budget.    The expressed opinions concentrated on the following issues:  the subjects to the law on taxes levied on the transfer of  rights on land use, the basis for tax rate calculation,  exemptions to the law, and the date the law will become  effective.    Most of the deputies agreed with the draft law on the  subjects to the law as they are all individuals and  organizations. Some deputies suggested that it should be  clearly specified that organizations are economic organizations.  However, some opinions suggested that the word organizations in  the draft law should be removed for the reason that land is  granted to organizations by the government. When the land is  not used, it must be returned to the government.    Some deputies suggested that there should be a  classification  for individuals and organizations that receive their rights on  land use before and after 1975. Before 1975, the people had to  pay for their rights of land use. But now the people can be  granted the right to land use free. Therefore, it is not fair  when they are classified in the same category.    Most of the deputies agreed with a suggestion to grant tax  exemptions to families of fallen combatants; injured soldiers of  class one and class two; and cadres, workers, and public  servants deployed to work in other localities. Other opinions  also proposed that tax exemptions should also be reduced for  sick soldiers of class one. Tax exemptions or reductions,  however, should not be granted when people move to other  residential areas of their choice.    Some opinions said that it is necessary to encourage people,  who turn fallow land into agricultural land or use land along  the national border and on islands for production activity, with  appropriate tax privileges. Most of the deputies held that the  proposed tax scale is too high. They suggested that the maximum  rate should not be set at 20 percent as outlined in the draft  law. The rates should be set at 5, 10, and 15 percent. The  deputies agreed with the draft law that the people's committees  of provinces and cities directly subordinated to the central  government must set appropriate rates for their own areas, based  on the guidelines issued by the government and on the local  situation and provided that their rates do not exceed more than  20 percent of the guidelines.    A deputy voiced his query that the draft law stipulates that  tax payers must pay their tax where their land is located. What  will happen if a person transfers his rights on land use and  another person receives the rights on land use reside in  different localities?    Somebody suggested that taxes should be reduced on a piece  of  land that has been transferred more than two times. But  somebody else suggested that in this case the tax should be many  times higher in order to stop the trading of land for profit,  thus preventing the increase of land prices.    Many deputies suggested deleting article four calling  organizations and individuals to support the taxation service in  its execution of the law on taxes levied on the transfer of  rights on land use. Other deputies proposed that this article  should be put together with article 15 about participation,  reward, and punishment.    Most of the expressed opinions suggested that the law on  taxes levied on the transfer of rights on land use should come  into effect on the day that the law is promulgated and it should  be retroactive to 15 October 1993, the promulgation date of the  Law on Land.    Tomorrow, the National Assembly will continue its debate in  the conference hall.</p>

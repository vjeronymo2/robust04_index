			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / UK Gilts: Dealers pin hopes on inflation figures BOND specialists are hoping publication this week of the latest figures for UK retail-price inflation will breathe new life into a lacklustre gilt market. A month ago, gilts suffered a sharp fall after a higher than expected increase in inflation in August. An inflation figure for September substantially different from the one anticipated by gilt dealers is likely to move the market substantially. This week also sees publication of a range of other UK economic data, including the latest unemployment figures and details of factory goods inflation last month, which may influence the market after a run of two weeks of muted yield reductions. Last week, long-dated gilts saw a fall in yields of about 10 basis points, with the yield on 15-year bonds being quoted on Friday night at just over 7 per cent on a par basis. The market's subdued recovery from the surprise of a 1.7 per cent increase in the retail prices index in the year to August has been mainly due to the generally good performance of other European bond markets. There has also been the perception in the UK that the recovery is weakening, a factor helping drive the belief that inflationary forces are still relatively insubstantial. On Wednesday, the Central Statistical Office will announce the year-on-year rise in the RPI to last month. City analysts expect this will stay at 1.7 per cent. They also believe the Treasury's figure for underlying inflation - the year-on-year rise in the RPI, excluding mortgage interest payments - will be 3.1 per cent last month, the same as in the year to August. Behind these expectations is the feeling that the UK economic recovery is running out of steam, a view backed by a survey of opinion among nearly 2,000 British companies published today by Dun &amp; Bradstreet, a business information company. This says the upturn is 'flattening out', with more than a fifth of employers not planning to give staff pay increases over the next year. More evidence of weak economic conditions will be sent privately by fax later today to UK Treasury economists from the House Builders' Federation. This is a trade association which every Monday sends the department data on the latest level of demand for new houses as registered by 26 of Britain's big housebuilding companies. The Treasury uses this data in trying to monitor economic conditions in the UK generally, part of its new-found interest in following events in a range of specific industrial sectors. The federation's latest figures indicate subdued demand for new houses, a big factor in the sluggish pace of growth in the past six months. Mr Roger Humber, the federation's director, says: 'The housing business has seen some improvement from last year. But last year was terrible. We're still some way from being where we would like to be.' As for other industrial sectors, Mr Kevin Mahoney, managing director of double-glazing company Caradon Everest and a member of the Treasury's industrial prospects committee, says demand in his sector is patchy, adding:'We're unlikely to see any rapid take off (in overall demand)'. While sentiment like this persists in the business world, demand for gilts is likely to remain relatively strong, keeping prices at around existing levels. The Bank of England is selling from today Pounds 950m of gilts in three tranches: Pounds 350m of 7 per cent Treasury bonds due 2001, Pounds 350m of 8 3/4 per cent Treasury stock due 2017 and Pounds 250m of index-linked 2 1/2 per cent bonds due 2011. The 2001 stock is being issued at a price of 101 15/16 , the gilts due 2017 at 118 and the index-linked stock at 168 5/8.</p>

			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: UK equities The rise of a mere 8 points in the FT-SE 100 index over the past week says it all. The market is uncertain how to respond to a period in which the US raised interest rates by a full half point, while UK economic data showed consumer spending surviving the tax cuts, but an unsettling rise in average earnings and a fall in bank lending. The hope was that the US would now back away from further rate rises so that bond markets could stabilise and equities enjoy some leeway again. With the recovery well entrenched in the UK, that should be good for London equities too. Instead doubts remain. On the international front the main concern is the dollar which closed last night below DM1.65. The US bond market will not easily regain its poise unless the currency strengthens. At home, worries about the rise in average earnings look premature; there is not much sign of inflationary pressure and the striking feature about retail sales was growth in volume rather than value. But the Bank of England is watching earnings closely for signs of reviving inflationary expectations. The weakness of bank lending may offer comfort on inflation, but the main problem seems to be a reluctance of companies to borrow, which suggests they are still concerned with balance sheet strength rather than new investment. Until that changes the recovery may remain too dependent on the consumer. Latest developments do not add up to a convincing argument for buying equities.</p>

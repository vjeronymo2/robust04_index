			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / Personal View: Why London should be a zone alone Opinion polls show overwhelming support for doing something about London. Something to promote the capital's cause, to co-ordinate the myriad public agencies responsible for its facilities - something or someone to shout for London. There is much less agreement on what that something should be. The left argues for a powerful London-wide body, probably an upper tier of local government. The right questions whether there is a problem at all, and looks for ways of getting business and community leaders talking to one another. The business community has a particular perspective and contribution to make to this debate. It is primarily concerned with London as a business location. The key to making London the most successful European business location is the central area where economic and business activities are concentrated. This covers the area within the Circle line of the underground, Zone 1 on the London underground map. As well as businesses, Zone 1 contains residential communities, government offices and cultural activities. Most of Zone 1 is in the City of London and City of Westminster. But parts are governed by other boroughs: Camden, Tower Hamlets, Hackney, Islington, Kensington and Chelsea, Wandsworth, Lambeth and Southwark. The centres of Paris, Frankfurt and Tokyo, by contrast, are under single local authorities. Even chaotic New York has only four boroughs - and they are overseen by a dominant city-wide government. London needs a single local authority for its central business district, a Zone 1 authority. It would take responsibility for functions such as promotion, planning, transport, education and housing. Last week's local elections have emphasised the need for such an authority, given that nine of the 10 local authorities are, at best, ambivalent towards business development and, at worst, hostile. The Zone 1 authority would be charged with delivering quality services and managing change through the planning system. It could also take over some additional functions from government (or quangos) such as conservation, policing and traffic management. The new Zone 1 authority would concentrate on those functions which it can do best. Debate over London's strategic planning and regional development should be left to other bodies, whether national or regional, in view of the complexities and geographical influence of the capital. The Zone 1 local authority should adopt the best practices and the most attractive features of the City of Westminster and the City of London. The City Corporation, which administers the City of London, is largely controlled by business representatives. It has been able to reflect the interests of the businesses that dominate the Square Mile and ensure its continuation as one of the world's leading financial centres. The City Corporation's business franchise would be inappropriate for a larger area that included the substantial residential areas of Westminster. But it should not be completely eliminated: responsiveness to businesses' wishes will be an essential attribute of the Zone 1 authority. An electoral system needs to be found that reflects business voters' wishes and local democratic interests - a blend of the two cities' practices. Indeed, a body promoting central London's wider interests might well have been able to help get approval for the CrossRail underground railway link, which was blocked by a Commons committee on Tuesday. The historic position of Lord Mayor of London should be maintained as a figurehead for the new authority with enormous promotional value. The title of Mayor of Westminster could be given to the leader of the council, who actually wields political control. The stewardship exercised by the City of London over the capital's bridges, parks, heaths and other public facilities could be maintained and extended to Hyde Park and St James's. The Corporation's patronage of the arts could embrace the West End, the South Bank complex and many other facilities. Central London is divided. The two cities upon which its wealth is built continue as separate entities at the expense of London's business community as a whole. Blending the best of both, and accepting that London is larger than both, is the essence of the Zone 1 plan. It challenges the City of London and its strong local traditions to reach forward to support a solution that can ensure London's status as a world city into the 21st century. It challenges the City of Westminster to widen its promotional concerns to embrace fully business as a wider London interest. The author is a partner in Hillier Parker, chartered surveyors</p>

			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / Retailers fear tough Christmas as rise in sales slows Trading conditions for Britain's shops in the crucial pre-Christmas period will be tough, retailers warned yesterday. Although official figures showed that retail sales in October were higher than last year, the rate of growth has slowed in recent months and price competition remains intense. The Central Statistical Office said retail sales volumes in October were a seasonally adjusted 0.1 per cent higher than in September. Year on year growth slowed to 3.1 per cent in October, from 3.5 per cent in September. On a three-month basis, a more accurate indication of trends, sales volumes were 0.6 per cent higher than over the three months to July, a slightly slower rate of growth than in previous months. Highlighting the fierce price competition in the high street, the value of retail sales rose only 0.7 per cent on a seasonally adjusted basis in the three months to October, compared with the previous three months. Adding to the picture of subdued retail activity, Bank of England figures showed yesterday that the annual growth rate of notes and coins in circulation in the past week stood at 5.8 per cent, the lowest since mid-July. The combination of slack consumer demand and low inflation will be welcomed by the government as it prepares for the Budget on November 29. Officials believe economic growth is now 're-balancing' from consumer demand towards an industry-based recovery. The figures disappointed retailers. Mr James May, director general of the British Retail Consortium, said: 'We now expect Christmas trading to be tough, with consumers spending wisely and carefully, but achieving levels slightly ahead of last year.'

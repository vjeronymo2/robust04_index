EL TIEMPO obtained this document as the last piece of  confirmation of its information sources, who met with ranking  officials and consulted firsthand sources. Contrary to what the  sources said, the document does not mention Ivan Marquez as  having participated in the summit, but does confirm other  reports already published by this newspaper.    The original source of the intelligence document is  precisely  a ranking, reliable official in the state secret service. "This  is what military intelligence knows about the summit in Cuba,"  the source told EL TIEMPO. This is why this paper attributed  the document to the Armed Forces intelligence service.    Yesterday, however, in a fax sent at 1011 to EL TIEMPO,  Brigadier General Fernando Tapias Stamelin, chief of the D-2  Intelligence Department of the Armed Forces, explained that the  document had not been issued by the military intelligence  service.    On Friday, during a brief talk with journalists, Army  Commander General Hernan Jose Guzman said the report "did not  emanate from military intelligence." EL TIEMPO published the  letter from General Tapias and a copy of each page of the report  today:    Doctor Hernando Santos    Director, Newspaper EL TIEMPO    Santa Fe de Bogota.    Page 31 of the respective 18 March 1994 edition of the  newspaper EL TIEMPO, in a four-column report entitled "Military  Intelligence Knew About the Summit," mentioned a restricted  three-page report, which allegedly emanated from military  intelligence. According to the article "the details of the  unique summit appeared one by one, and, of course, there was  mention of the presence and participation of Monsignor Nel  Beltran in the Havana summit. In five paragraphs and two  subparagraphs, the military intelligence services briefly  mentioned how much they knew about the participants in the  meeting.    After the Army, Navy, and Air Force intelligence  directorates, which comprise military intelligence, were  consulted, all affirmed that the document cited in the article  does not coincide with any report issued by the aforementioned  agencies and, therefore, could not have been released to any  journalist.    Yours truly,    [signed] Brig. Gen. Fernando Tapias Stamelin    Chief of the D2 Intelligence Department of the Armed Forces    [The following report appears alongside the previous  letter, enclosed in box format, with the word RESTRICTED at the  top and bottom of each of the three pages of the report]    [Page 1]  <H3>  Latin American and Caribbean Meeting for Solidarity,  Self-Determination, and Life of the Peoples, held in Havana  (Cuba) between 26 and 28 January 1994. </H3>   Havana (Cuba) PCC [Communist Party of Colombia], FARC  [Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia], ELN [Army of National  Liberation], and the EPL [Popular Liberation Army] -- The  "Fourth Latin American and Caribbean Summit for Solidarity and  Self-Determination and Life of the Peoples," which was attended  by PCC members and subversives of the FARC, ELN, and EPL was  also attended by insurgents from 35 Central and South American  countries, including members of the Mexican Zapatist movement,  the Salvador Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, and the  Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement of Peru. Those in attendance  included:    1. ALBERTO GUTIERREZ BERMUDEZ -- Alleged head of a FARC  column, who read a communique by the Colombian subversive groups  at the meeting. He has been living in Havana for two months in  Apartment No. 2, Building D-3, Zone-7 Alamar in eastern Havana.  Other subversives of the ELN and EPL also live in this  building. Together with other individuals from Central and  South America they receive subversive training at the  international aid camp "El Caimito" located in the vicinity of  Havana.    2. IVAN ROMERO and JORGE ORTEGA -- Members of the Central  Committee of the PCC and officials of the CUT [United Workers  Confederation] who cooperate with the FARC, supplying it  information on security organizations and persons who can be  kidnapped in the middle Magdalena region and Santander.    3. HERNANDO VILLATE -- Physician, sergeant-at-arms of the  PCC, who in his speech criticized the Colombian Government with  regard to human rights violations.    [Page 2]    4. JAIME CAICEDO TURRIACO -- PCC president.    5. LUIS EFRAIN VILLAMIL -- PCC member.    6. ALBERTO SANGUINO -- Colombian worker youth.    7. CAMILO CASTELLANOS -- representative of the Cinep  [Center for Research and Public Education].    8. MARIO GIRALDO VELEZ -- for the Trotskiyite Posada  Communist Party.    9. HERNAN DARIO CARDONA -- president of the Community  Federation.    10. ALFONSO ROMAN -- of the Socialist Renewal Movement.    11. TERESA QUINONES -- of the International Women's  League for Peace and Liberty (IMPAL).    This meeting carried out a campaign to discredit Colombia,  basing itself on the alleged abuses and violations of human  rights by Colombian authorities. To this end, members of the  "Group of Peoples Organizations of the Dominican Republic"  collected signatures among the participants, denouncing tortures  and mistreatment to which Dominican prisoners are allegedly  subjected to in Colombia. Apparently AIDA ABELLA coordinated  training for the members with the FARC.    [Page 3]    The Colombian subversives who travel to Cuba do not use  visas. They board a plane in Caracas or Cancun, using the Viasa  or Adeco airlines, on the Buenos Aires-Caracas-Cancun-Havana  route. They enter Cuba with a "tourist card" given to them by  the Caribbean representatives, Asisturis or Asertur, of which  RICARDO BALLESTEROS ALFONSO and JOAQUIN AMARIS AMARIS, PCC  members, are co- owners. This is how GUILLERMO LEON SAENZ  VARGAS (alias Alfonso Cano) of the FARC and LEONEL PARDEO of the  EPL traveled to Havana on 25 January to meet on 26 January with  Father Nel Beltran, FIDEL CASTRO, and other unidentified persons  with the intention of defining a strategy to exert pressure  through organizations such as Amnesty International and human  rights organizations so that the national government will  establish a dialogue with the guerrillas, based on a bilateral  cease-fire.</p>

A statement  issued by the group said that "the U.S. President's recent  statements reflect his continued support for the Zionist enemy's  racist and settlement policy. Proof of this is the U.S.  Administration's position at the Security Council and its  obstruction of merely a statement condemning the ugly massacre  committed by the Zionist occupation forces, which blessed what  the Zionist settler had done, namely the murder of 40  worshipers, and have since themselves killed over 50 people so  far."    The statement said: "The peoples of the Islamic world view  with great anger the U.S. Administration's position, which  treats the rights of Muslims in Palestine and holy Jerusalem  with contempt." The statement urged the Islamic nation "to  condemn the U.S. position on the Palestinian issue and express  popular anger at this position, which is totally biased toward  the Zionist enemy."    Concluding the statement, the Muslim Brotherhood group said:  "We remind the U.S. Administration that its interests are linked  with the peoples of the Islamic world. It is impossible for the  current situation to continue as it stands. Ignoring the Arabs'  and Muslims' rights in Palestine, in particular holy Jerusalem,  negates the United States' neutrality and possible mediation in  resolving the Palestinian issue -- which is clearly reflected in  the current negotiations."</p>

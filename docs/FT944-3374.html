			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / Economic Watch: German consumption still weak German private consumption is showing continuing weakness as retail sales figures for October, released yesterday, indicated a decline of 2 per cent in real terms from the same month a year earlier. The fall against September this year (seasonally and calendar adjusted) was also 2 per cent. September's figure had shown a rise against August. Last week's third-quarter figures for west German gross domestic product had indicated a stronger rise in private consumption than expected, put down by some economists to the seasonal adjustment process which they said might no longer reflect buying trends. Yesterday's announcement from the federal statistics office showed consumption has still to pick up after the recession. The decline in the first 10 months was a real 1 per cent for the whole country. Department store turnover in west Germany, down a nominal 8 per cent, was especially weak. Mail order sales dropped 3 per cent and those of supermarkets fell 4 per cent. Norway's trade surplus in November fell to NKr5.2bn (Pounds 485m) against NKr6.1bn in October. The trade surplus for November 1993 was NKr3.6bn. Spain's budget deficit narrowed in the first 11 months of 1994 after revenues rose 4.4 per cent and spending climbed 2.7 per cent, said Mr Pedro Solbes, economy minister. He said Spain's current account deficit would be slightly above forecast for this year, at about 1 per cent of GDP, while the deficit for 1995 could be similar.</p>

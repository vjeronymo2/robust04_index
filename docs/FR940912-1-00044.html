			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Wastewater Concentration and Flow Determination  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The standards require the use of approved test methods  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and procedures to ensure consistent and verifiable results  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for demonstration that a wastewater stream does not require  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control, or for demonstration that the allowed emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> levels are achieved when controls are applied. Affected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastewater streams are subject to the standards if they meet  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> either of the following conditions at the point of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generation:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The average flow rate of the affected wastewater  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stream is 1.0 Lpm or greater and the mass-weighted average  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> volatile organic concentration is 500 ppmw or greater; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The mass-weighted average volatile organic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentration of the affected wastewater stream is 10,000  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ppmw or greater, regardless of the stream flow rate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two important parameters must be quantified to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determine whether an affected stream must be controlled.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These parameters are the annual wastewater quantity for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stream and the volatile organic concentration of the stream  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at the point of generation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several methods can be used to determine wastewater  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quantity. These methods include using knowledge about the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capacity of the wastewater-generating process or the waste  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> management unit, and using measurements that are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> representative of maximum annual wastewater generation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rates. Knowledge-based methods are allowed to provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> flexibility and to provide less expensive alternatives than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> actual annual measurement if the appropriate information is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For quantifying the volatile organic concentration of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the wastewater streams, three methods are available:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Knowledge of the wastewater streams; (2) bench scale or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pilot scale test data; or (3) physical measurements of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> volatile organic concentration. These methods have been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowed to provide flexibility and to provide less expensive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternatives than actual measurement if the appropriate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information is available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the actual volatile organic concentration of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastewater stream is determined through direct measurement,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the regulation specifies that the procedures of Method 25D  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in appendix A of part 60, ``Determination of the Volatile  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Organic Concentration of Waste Samples,'' which provides a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relative measure of the emissions potential of the stream,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be used to analyze the sample. Alternatively, the sample  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may be analyzed to determine the volatile organic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentration using any test method or test data that has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been validated according to the protocols in Method 301 in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appendix A of part 63. As pointed out in section II of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> document, there are several issues associated with the use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of method 25D on which the EPA is soliciting comment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Flow rates may be determined using information about  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the maximum annual production capacity of the process unit,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> knowledge of the process, and mass balance information or by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measuring the flow rate at the point of generation during  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditions that are representative of average wastewater  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generation rates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Performance Tests  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The initial performance test requirements of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 60.8 of the part 60 General Provisions are not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required for treatment processes or vent stream control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> devices. Instead, the proposed standards provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative means of compliance that the EPA considers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equivalent to the direct measurement of emissions as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required under &sect;60.8 and less burdensome to the industry.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rule includes treatment process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance test procedures for the effluent concentration,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent reduction, and required mass removal standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These test procedures involve measurements of volatile  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organic concentrations using Method 25D or any other methods  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for which the results are validated using Method 301.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Performance testing is to be conducted at representative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inlet flow rates and at volatile organic concentrations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under which it would be most difficult to determine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For noncombustion treatment processes complying with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the percent reduction requirement, the total volatile  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organic mass flow rate entering the treatment process and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exiting the treatment process shall be determined by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> computing the product of the average flow rate of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastewater stream entering or exiting the treatment process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the average total volatile organic concentration of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entering or exiting wastewater streams, respectively. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> flow rate of the entering and exiting wastewater streams  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shall be determined using the inlet and outlet flow meters,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respectively.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For combustion treatment processes complying with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent reduction requirement, the total volatile organic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mass flow rate entering the combustion unit shall be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined by computing the product of the average flow rate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the wastewater stream entering the combustion unit, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined by the inlet flow meter, and the average total  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> volatile organic concentration in the waste stream entering  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the combustion device. The volume exhausted shall be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined using Method 2, 2A, 2C, or 2D of 40 CFR part 60,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appendix A, as appropriate. The average total organic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentration in the exhaust downstream of the combustion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unit shall be determined using Method 18 of appendix A of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> part 60, or any other test method validated according to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures in Method 301 of appendix A of part 63.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

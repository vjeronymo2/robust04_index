			<p>BFN     [Text] In a message to the nation on the occasion of 18 May  [Flag and University Day], Haitian head of state Jean-Bertrand  Aristide, who has been living in exile since the 30 September  1991 coup d'etat, says he applauds the courage the Haitian  people (?have shown) since the beginning of the crisis. The  president sent a message of unity, reiterating that an end must  be put to the tragic situation the population has been  experiencing for a very long time now.    [Begin Aristide recording] The flag of unity has existed  since 18 May 1803, so Haitians can live freely in a free Haiti.  Let us doff our hat to our flag.    We, like all other peoples, have a flag. It is not a gift  from foreign colonists; nor a trinket, merely for display; nor  an ornament for outward show. Our flag resulted from a battle  against slavery. The blood of our ancestors was shed so all  peoples would respect us, once we respect one another.    Let us doff our hat to our flag. Every time we hoist our  flag, what we are hoisting is the symbol of that very freedom.  Every time we sing our national anthem, we are swearing ipso  facto that Haitians live freely in a country that is theirs.    Let us doff our hat to our flag. That must be done. We must  have it done. We must all join hands so that Haiti can be  released from any disguised form of slavery.    The dreams of our students are our nice university dreams.  [sentence as heard] Congratulations to you! An avalanche of  admiration and respect to the memory of all students who (?have  died), like stars of hope! To (?honor) their memory, we must  lift Haiti's chin. [end recording]</p>

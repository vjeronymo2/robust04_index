			<p><P> May 2, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BUSH ASKS ALLIED CENSURE OF PANAMA BALLOT RIGGING;  </P> <P> PRESSURES NORIEGA BEFORE VOTE  </P> <P> President Bush today called for all U.S. allies to condemn anticipated massive  election fraud in Panama, where the Administration predicts Manuel Antonio  Noriega will steal Sunday's vote.  </P> <P> "All nations that value democracy -- that understand free and fair elections  are the very heart of their democratic system -- should speak out against  election fraud in Panama," Bush said in remarks to the Council of the Americas,  an organization of business people. "That means the democracies of Europe, as  well as nations in this hemisphere struggling to preserve the democratic  systems they've fought so hard to put in place."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Anti-Noriega Rhetoric  </P> <P> Bush continued to step up the Administration's anti-Noriega rhetoric as the  Panamanian election nears. He repeated his promise that the United States "will  not recognize the results of a fraudulent election engineered to keep Noriega  in power."  </P> <P> The government, controlled by Noriega, is backing the general's close  associate, Carlos Duque, for president. An opposition coalition is backing  Guillermo Endara.  </P> <P> Bush said it took "great courage" for the opposition to enter the campaign.  </P> <P> "A free and fair vote in the elections," Bush said, would enable Panama "to  take a significant step toward ending the international isolation and internal  economic crisis brought on by the Noriega regime."  </P> <P> But, added Bush, "It is evident that the regime is ready to resort to massive  election fraud in order to remain in power."  </P> <P> White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk accused the Noriega regime of altering  voter lists, invalidating voter registration cards of opposition supporters and  firing government workers opposed to Noriega.  </P> <P> In a speech touching on the economic, political and social situation throughout  the hemisphere, the President also said that unless Nicaragua's leftist  government changes the "ominous" actions leading to its elections next  February, "it will be a tragic setback -- and a dangerous one. The  consolidation of tyranny will not be peace. It will be a crisis waiting to  happen."  </P> <P> The President blasted the election laws recently passed by the  Sandinista-controlled National Assembly. He accused the Sandinistas of imposing  a "stacked deck" against their opposition by unilaterally setting the rules,  giving excessive enforcement powers to the Interior Ministry and barring  private ownership of television stations.  </P> <P> But he did not say whether he would accept the results of elections under the  Sandinista rules.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Aid to Contras  </P> <P> The Bush Administration is supplying non-lethal aid to Nicaraguan rebels until  the elections.  </P> <P> Bush also called for "a new partnership for the Americas."  </P> <P> He mentioned cooperation against drug trafficking and efforts to ease the debt  burden of Latin American governments, but the speech included no new  initiatives or policies.  </P> <P> He also renewed his demand that Moscow end its backing of left-wing subversion  in Central America.  </P></p>

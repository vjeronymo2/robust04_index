			<p>BFN     [Text] A Macedonian youth was stabbed during the clashes  between Macedonians and members of the Albanian ethnic minority  in Tetovo. The tension between the two ethnic communities is  rising in light of the upcoming public census in Macedonia [The  Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM].    The Albanians, who officially constitute 23 percent of the  population, boycotted the last census in 1991. They claim they  account for 40 percent of Macedonia's population. In western  Macedonia, which is seen as a potential hotbed of clashes, the  Albanians make up approximately 70 percent of the population.</p>

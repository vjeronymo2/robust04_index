			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / Management: The dangers of a culture crash IT is an old trick, played most often in euphemism-loving America, for two companies to describe the takeover of one by the other as 'a merger'. It makes both top managements feel more comfortable about the deal, and for a while mollifies all the other 'stakeholders' concerned. Goliath swallows David, but they tell shareholders, employees, governments and local communities they are 'merging'. A few years down the road the truth becomes all too obvious. Not only has the senior partner swallowed the junior, but frequently it has also destroyed most of the latter's special skills - the very things which helped prompt the acquisition in the first place. From the signs of the past few days, this is all too likely to be the way things turn out once giant Renault and tiny Volvo consummate the 'marriage' which they announced this week. Most French observers certainly expect Renault to dominate. In its main headlines about the deal, the influential newspaper Le Monde toed the official line about 'fusion' (merger), but gave the game away on an inside page with a sub-heading which read starkly: 'L'absorption par Renault'. For Volvo to go the way of so many acquired companies in the past would be a tragedy. This is not just because of its innovative skills in production and international management. Far more important is that this would destroy what could otherwise have been the potential for Renault-Volvo, like ABB (Asea Brown Boveri) before it, to become an entirely new European company, capable through leanness, speed and flexibility, of challenging the toughest competition that either the US or Japan could throw at it. Supporters of Louis Schweitzer, the purportedly internationalist and certainly ambitious head of Renault, will protest that this is exactly his intention. If so, he has already, in several senses, fluffed his first chance. Instead of locating the head office of the new group at Renault's existing HQ in western Paris - with twin offshoots there and in Gothenburg - he should have made the classic move of a 'transformational' leader: broken sharply with the company's past by choosing a fresh site elsewhere. Since national politics make a move to neutral Belgium or the Netherlands impossible, he could at least have moved the HQ to the other side of town. Percy Barnevik, the Swede who heads ABB, took such a step by locating its new HQ in Zurich, a short but significant distance from Brown Boveri's old Baden office. Actions of this kind are far from merely symbolic: they tend to energise management when a company is faced with any kind of radical change. Not for nothing did AT&amp;T move out of its pompous Philip Johnson-designed Manhattan skyscraper when it was forced to revitalise itself. The reformist new boss of troubled Digital Equipment has just taken a similar decision to leave the Massachusetts mill where it has been since birth. If Louis Gerstner is well advised in his battle to stop IBM from sinking, he will abandon the company's plush HQ in leafy Armonk. A second immediate step by Schweitzer should have been to declare that the Paris head office will be staffed entirely on merit by a wide range of nationalities, including Swedes, Dutch and Americans. Otherwise, the suspicion must be that it will be dominated by the French. The equivalent worry would apply equally to a Swedish, Dutch, American or British parent company. It is not too late for Schweitzer to make such a move: he could still change course before January, the date by which he has said the details of senior staffing arrangements will be settled. To hold back until after the subsequent privatisation would lose precious time, and also forego (taking) a step towards internationalisation which would make Renault-Volvo more attractive to private investors. Delaying would also provoke more resistance among his French staff. The nationality of key staff is closely linked with the question of what sort of organisational and 'culture change' processes Schweitzer intends to initiate across and down the company. Even if it were not swallowing Volvo, Renault would have had to undergo a wrenching series of such changes as it emerged from the protective arm of the state. Now, the challenge will be all the greater. Rather than 'fusing' the two cultures, as commentators have suggested, his objective must be to create an entirely new culture, as Barnevik has done at ABB. This will undoubtedly require some existing elements from both sides, such as Renault's emphasis on flair and adventure in design and marketing, and Volvo's greater informality and internationalism. Injecting each of these into the other side will be hard enough. But if, as at ABB, Renault and Volvo are to develop quickly the vital unifying sense of building a new world together - which requires much more than just using a newly decreed language (English) - they must also borrow from around the world fresh attitudes, disciplines and procedures. Given the gulf between typical French and Swedish attitudes to such basic management variables as authority, delegation and uncertainty, Schweitzer's task here will be tough indeed. He will find it a little easier if he can bring himself to hold up an Americanised version of Swedish culture - more decisive and entrepreneurial - as a model at which to aim. By no means all of this can be done quickly; creating ABB has so far taken Barnevik five years. But for any of it to succeed, Schweitzer needs to get off on the right foot. In spite of his stumbles this week, he still has time to do so. The best way of doing that would be to behave internally, not just towards the media, as if the deal really is a merger.</p>

			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / Further fall in house prices HOUSE PRICES in the UK fell further last month although inquiries from purchasers wanting to buy homes rose sharply, Halifax, Britain's biggest building society, said yesterday. The society, which publishes a monthly house-price index, said that prices on average fell by 1.2 per cent last month after a 1.3 per cent fall in December. It said: 'Although there were encouraging signs of an upturn in activity in the housing market in January, this will have little impact on prices over the next few months.' The society is forecasting little increase in prices this year. It expects prices to rise more strongly next year. The average price of a house last month, at Pounds 64,470, was 3.6 per cent less than in January last year. The annual fall in the average price of a new house was even greater, at 4.6 per cent. The society said yesterday: 'It is too early to talk of recovery, but the signs are promising. Halifax's estate agency arm reports more customers visiting their offices than for some time. Applications for mortgages last month were significantly higher than in December or January last year, although it should be remembered that mortgage applications last January were abnormally low during the run-up to the Gulf war.' The society said that prices would take time to recover, even when sales started to pick up, because so many unsold properties were still on the market. The sharp fall in the number of new homes being started by builders has stabilised since the summer of last year, according to figures published yesterday by the Department of the Environment. They show that 134,800 new private homes were started last year, compared with 134,900 in 1990. In the final three months of last year, builders started work on 29,000 new private homes compared with 28,700 in the last three months of 1990. Construction companies last year started work on 160,300 houses and flats, including homes for housing associations and councils - 1,000 fewer than in the previous year. Lex, Page 22</p>

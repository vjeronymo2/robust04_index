			<p><P> July 24, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THORNBURGH WARY OF HOUSE'S S&amp;L BILL;  </P> <P> ATTORNEY GENERAL SAYS ANTI-FRAUD EFFORTS DON'T REQUIRE LEGISLATION'S PROPOSALS  </P> <P> Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh said today that legislation moving through the House  would interfere with the Administration's pursuit of savings and loan fraud.  </P> <P> Thornburgh, in testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee, generally praised  an anti-fraud bill adopted by the Senate two weeks ago, but he said sections of  legislation moving through the House would be counterproductive.  </P> <P> One provision creates a National Commission on Financial Crimes, with members  appointed by President Bush and congressional leaders, to study and recommend  changes to the government's anti-fraud effort.  </P> <P> "We believe that the proposed commission would be counterproductive . . . (and  would) almost certainly interfere in the continuing aggressive investigation  and prosecution of financial institution malefactors," Thornburgh said.  </P> <P> He also opposed a House proposal to expand the jurisdiction of the Secret  Service, an arm of the Treasury Department that already investigates  counterfeiting, to include fraud.  </P> <P> Thornburgh said the FBI, a Justice Department bureau, has the "necessary and  proven expertise" to serve as the primary agency probing S&amp;L fraud. The  House legislation, he said, "represents a cumbersome approach to addressing  financial-institution offenses."  </P> <P> The Senate bill provides $162.5 million in each of the next three years to  increase the number of prosecutors and FBI agents pursuing S&amp;L cases. It  also increased the maximum prison sentence for bank fraud from 20 years to 30  years.  </P> <P> L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., said  S&amp;L abuses, more prevalent in the Southwest and Southern California, are  now turning up in the Northeast and Florida as well.  </P> <P> Timothy Ryan, director of the Office of Thrift Supervision, complained that  well-publicized sentences of S&amp;L executives ranging up to 30 years  "unfortunately . . . are the exception." He ticked off examples of what he  considered light sentences, including one year of unsupervised probation given  an Alabama S&amp;L vice president found responsible for $2 million in losses.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Bert Ely, a financial institutions analyst in Alexandria, Va.,  maintains in a new study that fraud cost $5 billion, or only 3% of what he  figures is the bailout's $147-billion total cost.  </P></p>

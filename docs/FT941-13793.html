			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / Business Travel: Routes for crowd-lover and loner - A city not built for athletes / Joggers' Guide - Tokyo Tokyo is a joggers' nightmare. Parks are few and far between, often dusty and invariably crowded. Pavements are rare outside the centre. In the summer the city is so hot and humid it is often uncomfortable to walk, let alone run. Yet finding places to jog or walk is not impossible; it just requires more effort than in many other cities: The most popular jogging route is in the centre: a 5km circuit, with a shorter variant. The route is along a pavement around the moat that surrounds the Imperial Palace. It is within walking distance of many top business hotels, such as the Imperial and the Palace, or via Hibiya station on the green Chiyoda subway line. Often crowded in the mornings, most of the route runs parallel to a six-lane highway. Further along the Chiyoda line towards Shinjuku, the best park to run in is Yoyogi Park in Harajuku, the largest in Tokyo (get off at the Harajuku stop on the Chiyoda line). One of the big attractions at the weekend is the variety of Japanese lifestyles on display, from exotic punks to families in formal kimonos attending the nearby Meiji shrine. The more adventurous might want to go further afield. A favourite spot for walking on a Sunday night is the docks at Shinagawa: ask a taxi driver to take you to the Shinagawa Futo Wharf. As Japan is such a law-abiding place, the area is neither patrolled by dogs nor enclosed by barbed-wire fences. People walk along the dock, a mile round-trip, simply by dipping under a chain. The area is deserted. Cranes stretch out towards Yokohama and Tokyo bay as airliners land at Haneda airport. The best view of Tokyo as a city is framed beneath the newly opened Tokyo Bay bridge. In the height of summer the docks are one place where there can be cool breezes. Another favourite beat is along the tow path of the Tamagawa River, which is a 25-minute rail journey from the city centre. Catch the purple Hanzomon line to Futako Tamagawaen. Then walk down the river towards the exclusive neighbourhood of Den en Chofu. The walk takes about an hour.</p>

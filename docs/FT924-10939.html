			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / International Company News: Northern Telecom gains 11% and predicts further growth NORTHERN Telecom, the Canadian telecommunications equipment maker, has reported a surprisingly strong 11 per cent rise in third-quarter earnings and predicted further 'respectable' growth for the rest of the year. Yesterday's third-quarter earnings report set off a rise in Northern Telecom's shares, which closed CDollars 2 1/8 higher at CDollars 45 1/2 on the Toronto stock exchange yesterday. The stock has traded as high as CDollars 58 this year, but recently fell below CDollars 40 on reports of weaker demand and intensifying competition in many markets. Earnings climbed to USDollars 113m, or 46 cents a share, from USDollars 102m, or 42 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenues rose 5 per cent to Dollars 2.02bn. The order intake improved by 8 per cent to Dollars 2.26bn, and orders on hand stood at a record Dollars 3.38bn on September 30, 16 per cent higher than a year earlier. The company said that gross margins widened by about 2 percentage points, reflecting growth in sales of central office switches. Dr Paul Stern, chairman, ascribed the improvement mainly to expanding market share. 'The market is tough, and we're slugging it out on the strength of product and our relationships,' Dr Stern said. He added that he still expected earnings for the year as a whole to exceed 1991 levels. For the first nine months, earnings were Dollars 293m, down from Dollars 307m in January-September 1991. Third-quarter revenues rose in all geographic markets except Europe, which was affected by weak demand as well as the divestiture of some businesses which Nortel acquired as part of its takeover of Britain's STC in March 1991. Sales of business communications systems and terminals were flat, but revenues from all other product lines increased, with the biggest rises posted by transmission products and cable.</p>

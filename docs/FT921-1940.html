			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Investment tips you should consider - The Election and You THERE are 13 investing days to go until the election. This is what the investment professionals might call a time of extreme political risk and volatility. Some less scrupulous advisers and salesmen might call it a great selling opportunity. If your earnings are substantially above the national average, then Labour's tax regime is likely to leave you worse off (see right). Several measures might alleviate the problem, but do not invest in haste, only to repent at leisure over the next five years. As the tables show, higher top-rate taxes could substantially eat into income, so leaving large amounts of capital tied up for the long term could make life even worse. The following measures could all make sense, but only if they fit with the underlying logic of your financial planning. Seek advice before acting. Family Companies If you are a director of a family company, pay yourself bonuses this tax year rather than next. Accountants Blick Rothenberg suggest that this should be done through the PAYE scheme for this tax year, as this cannot be done retroactively. Similar arguments apply to the payment of dividends - you might increase them and pay them between April 1 and 5. Business Expansion Scheme. Labour will abolish the least risky property assured tenancy side of the scheme. So if you were thinking of a BES investment anyway, the logic in favour of doing so becomes greater. But it is essential, in this market, to tread with caution. Inheritance tax. Make Potentially Exempt lifetime transfers now, as they could be threatened by Labour's long-term plans for IHT. Capital Gains Tax. 'Bed and Breakfasting' (selling shares and rebuying them the following day) to crystallise gains makes more sense than usual, as CGT thresholds are likely to go down under Labour. Offshore Funds are not as strong a tax-planning tool as they were, but they do allow you to defer any tax until you bring the funds back onshore. If you are confident Labour would be booted out after five years, they could therefore make sense. Personal Equity Plans make sense if you do not trust Labour to keep them, but it may not be wise to buy into equities just as the market hits a period of extreme uncertainty.</p>

			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: About right Sir, Geoffrey Martin, head of the European Commission, London, has strongly refuted press allegations that Britain's membership of the EU has cost Pounds 235bn, and added that public debate needs to be based on accurate information. A 'back of the envelope' calculation (the Common Agricultural Policy, ERM, handing-over of fishing zones, business losses through over-regulation, reduction of Commonwealth trade, Brussels' cut of taxes . . .) suggests that Pounds 200bn may not be far wrong. Does anyone know where accurate information can be found? David Pollard, Nelson &amp; Pollard Publishing, Folly Bridge Workshops, Thames Street, Oxford OX1 1SU</p>

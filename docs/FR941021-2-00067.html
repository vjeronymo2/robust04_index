			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> The nine functional areas of responsibility for carriers under Part B are:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> &bull;Claim Payment;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Review and Hearing;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Beneficiary or Physician Inquiry;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Provider (physician/supplier) Education and Training;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Medical Review and Utilization Review;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Medicare Secondary Payer;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Participating Physicians;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Productivity Investments; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Benefits Integrity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These functions are funded from the Hospital Insurance and Supplementary Medical Insurance trust funds. The data, standards, and methodology used in these functional areas are discussed in section IV. of this notice. In the following national budget summary, we have combined the discussion of functional areas that are common to fiscal intermediaries and carriers. However, data specific to Part A or Part B are provided under each heading. Workload estimates are provided for all functional areas where the development of the budget is predominantly workload driven. Workload estimates are not provided for functional areas that are not predominantly workload driven, or for which a workload is uncertain until final negotiations with the Medicare contractors are complete.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=2 --> 1. Bill and Claim Payment (Part A and Part B)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> We currently estimate the Part A processed workload to be 129.2 million bills in FY 1995. The Part B processed workload is currently projected at 655.6 million claims and is based on the current funding available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=2 --> 2. Reconsideration (Review Under Part B) and Hearing (Part A and Part B)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> This function includes all activities related to guaranteeing due process of law as a result of contractor action, for example, disallowances on bills and claims. The estimated workload volume is expected to total approximately 10.9 million for FY 1995.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In FY 1995, we expect to maintain efficiencies achieved in prior years through the use of shorter decision letters and the experimental use of the telephone to conduct reviews and reconsiderations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=2 --> 3. Medicare Secondary Payer (Part A and Part B)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The Medicare Secondary Payer (MSP) function is the first of four initiatives (Medicare Secondary Payer, Medical Review and Utilization Review, Benefits Integrity, and Provider Audit) we developed as ``Payment Safeguards'' to safeguard the Medicare program against improper payments. The focus of the MSP initiative is to ensure that the Medicare program pays for covered care only to the extent required after payment by the primary insurer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicare contractors are responsible for identifying MSP situations and aggressively pursuing the recovery of improper payments from the appropriate party. The standard for determining the amount of MSP funding a contractor will receive in FY 1995 is based on workload volumes, required systems changes, and any special projects that may be assigned to contractors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on actuarial analysis, we develop specific savings goals for each contractor. The goals are developed on estimates of savings to be achieved by contractors for the MSP categories of working aged, disabled, workers' compensation, end-stage renal disease, and liability or no-fault insurance. After assigning goals to contractors, funds are allocated based on the various MSP activities a contractor must perform such as processing prepayment claims, postpayment claims, inquiries, outreach, and hospital reviews.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In FY 1995, the Initial Enrollment Questionnaire (IEQ) will be operational. The IEQ eliminates the need for first claim development on approximately 85 percent of the new enrollees. This initiative will improve service to beneficiaries on a national basis by providing detailed information on the MSP program at the time a beneficiary enrolls in Medicare.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We have also included funding to process the workloads based on the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)/Social Security Administration (SSA)/HCFA data match project created by section 6202 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989 (OBRA '89), Public Law 101&hyph;239. The funds are allocated on the basis of the number of report identification numbers a contractor will process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to the IRS/SSA/HCFA data match, we will continue to pursue other data matches with State Motor Vehicle Administrations, Workers' Compensation, and Medicaid Agencies, and the Departments of Defense, Labor, and Veterans Affairs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=2 --> 4. Medical Review and Utilization Review (Parts A and B)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> In addition to processing and paying claims from providers of services and Medicare beneficiaries, contractors perform medical and utilization reviews of claims to determine whether services are covered under the program and are medically necessary. The distribution of Medicare contractor funding is based on each contractor's proportion of the workload and individual contractor medical review/utilization review projects.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

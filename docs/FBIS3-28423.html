			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Is There Really No Problem in Security </F> Posture?"]    [Summary] Misgivings due to prevailing war scenarios on  the Korean peninsula are being amplified by the analysis by the  U.S. Defense Department that North Korea already possesses  nuclear weapons and has developed transportation devices. The  situation has become even worse with North Korea's forward  disposition and the U.S. Pyongyang occupation strategy. We want  to ask the government and the Army if we really need to worry  about our security, and if we would be able to deter and ease  the worst possible situation.    The best combat capability is deterrence. Therefore, our  government should have confidence in the following five areas:    First, strengthened acquisition and analysis capability of  intelligence concerning North Korean affairs. The North Korean  nuclear issue is not an issue of the United States or Japan.    Second, military morale. The recent survey showing that our  soldiers do not have self-confidence in their profession could  result in a crisis.    Third, establishment of a reliable military image, that is,  to clear up all doubts regarding arms purchase irregularities.    Fourth, answer doubts concerning the arms system, including  the jamming system of the F-16's and other Yulgok projects.    Fifth, establishment of a unified reunification policy and a  consistent security policy.</p>

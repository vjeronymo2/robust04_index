			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / International Company News: Sammi wins Won130bn injection SOUTH Korean banks are to inject Won130bn (Dollars 165.3m) in Sammi Group, the debt-plagued owner of the country's largest speciality steelmaker, Reuter reports from Seoul. The group had earlier asked its banks to extend Won144bn to rescue it. The Commercial Bank of Korea, Sammi's primary lender, said the banks had 'agreed in principle to bail out Sammi, given its predictable adverse effects on other industries'. Sammi said its total debts had snowballed to Won1,780bn at the end of 1991, against total assets of Won2,300bn. Some Won700bn of total was owed by Sammi Steel, its speciality steel subsidiary. Sammi is also engaged in trade, precision machinery, aircraft and car part manufacturing and electronics. The group's financial position was hurt by rumours last year, denied by the company, that it might be forced to file for bankruptcy protection from creditors. Analysts blamed Sammi's difficulties on ambitious expansion in the 1980s in anticipation of a recovery in speciality steel which failed to materialise. They identified as pointers to trouble a heavy investment of Dollars 260m in three steel companies in North America in 1989 and an injection of some Won300bn on increasing production of speciality steel in South Korea from 1988.</p>

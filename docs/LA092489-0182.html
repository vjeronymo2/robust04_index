			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FAR WEST ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> AIR FORCE BEATS UTEP TO REMAIN UNDEFEATED  </P> <P> Quarterback Dee Dowis rushed for 82 yards and two touchdowns in the first half  as Air Force raced to a 26-point lead and coasted to a 43-26 Western Athletic  Conference victory over Texas El Paso Saturday at the Air Force Academy in  Colorado.  </P> <P> Air Force, 4-0 overall and 3-0 in the conference, proved vulnerable to the pass  in the second half. UTEP's Howard Gasser threw for three scores, but he also  was sacked nine times.  </P> <P> The Miners, dropping to 1-3 overall and 0-1 in the WAC, went almost exclusively  to the air during the second half, running the ball only three times in a  desperation bid that fell short.  </P> <P> Gasser's 47-yard heave to Ricki Lopez drew the Miners within 36-26 with 4:55  left, but Dowis then directed a time-consuming drive that culminated in Greg  Johnson's six-yard score with 27 seconds remaining.  </P> <P> Dowis, who went into the game as the nation's second-leading rusher with a  per-game average of 163 yards, finished with 92 yards in 13 carries.  </P> <P> Colorado State 35, Eastern Michigan 35 -- Hector Murillo scored on a one-yard  run and Tim Henneghan's conversion kick was good as the Hurons fought back for  a tie at Fort Collins, Colo.  </P> <P> The Hurons thought they won the game on a touchback after a fumbled  interception in the end zone in the last three seconds, but referees ruled that  the Rams did not attempt to advance the ball and the touchback was denied.  </P> <P> The Rams went ahead in the fourth quarter on a touchdown by Tony Alford, 35-28,  but Murillo's run tied it.  </P> <P> A 41-yard field goal attempt by the Rams' Mike Brown failed. The Hurons took  possession, and a pass by the Hurons was intercepted in the end zone by Kevin  Nettles, who dropped the ball.  </P> <P> Colorado State is 1-2-1; Eastern Michigan is 3-0-1.  </P> <P> Tulsa 35, New Mexico 33 -- Fullback Brett Adams rushed for 128 yards and three  touchdowns to lead the Golden Hurricane to victory at Tulsa.  </P> <P> The Lobos had a chance to win the game with five seconds left, but David  Margolis' 44-yard field goal attempt with a 20-m.p.h. wind behind him hit the  left upright and bounced away.  </P> <P> Tulsa is 3-1. New Mexico is 1-3.  </P></p>

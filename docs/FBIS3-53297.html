Israeli military planes overflew al-Nabatiyah,  Iqlim al-Tuffah, and Sidon for 15 minutes, carrying out  low-altitude mock raids.    According to our correspondent, Israeli occupation forces  surrounded Rumaysh, near Bint Jubayl, this morning. The reason  for the move was that 15 village youths refused to enlist in  Lahd's [South Lebanese Army -- SLA] militia.    Norwegian soldiers of the UN Interim Force in Lebanon,  stationed in al-'Urqub, tried to prevent an Israeli Lahdist  force from entering Shab'a, but the latter succeeded in entering  the village following one hour of negotiations.    REUTER cites a security source in the south to the effect  that Lahd militiamen deployed this morning on main roads leading  to villages in the western sector of the occupied border strip  in order to impress men aged 16 to 35 for military training with  the said militia. The militia threatened to take measures  against the families of those who fail to undergo training. The  source adds that the militias have set up roadblocks on the main  roads and intend to search houses for men in the said age group.</p>

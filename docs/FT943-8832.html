			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / BSkyB in OFT cable charges inquiry The Office of Fair Trading is conducting preliminary inquiries into satellite TV company BSkyB's position in the UK satellite and cable television market. The office wrote last month to nine cable companies asking whether they had had problems obtaining programmes from BSkyB or other suppliers. It is particularly interested in BSkyB's charges to cable operators. If the OFT finds that there have been problems, it will launch a full investigation. The office yesterday said that it could not discuss the responses it had received so far. Many cable operators buy in BSkyB's most popular channels to supply them to subscribers. But the cost of doing so has prompted some to attempt to reduce their reliance on BSkyB by buying programming for their own cable-only channels. That, however, can lead to bidding wars which push up the price of television rights to sporting events or films, for example. News of the inquiries came as it emerged that several cable companies, including Telecommunications Inc (TCI), the largest US cable operator, have approached BSkyB over taking a stake in the satellite broadcaster. TCI, which has large shareholdings in two UK cable companies, TeleWest and Flextech, has held initial discussions with BSkyB on taking a stake, and the two sides were reported yesterday to be due to meet again shortly. Both BSkyB and TCI yesterday declined to comment on the reports. The attraction of a link-up between a cable operator and BSkyB would be to secure access to BSkyB channels and avoid bidding wars for programming. There is also speculation that Mr Rupert Murdoch, whose News Corporation owns 50 per cent of BSkyB, wants to increase his involvement in cable tele-vision. It is not clear, however, where scope for another investor in BSkyB would come from. The other main shareholders - Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, which has 17.5 per cent, and Granada, with 12 per cent - are thought to be unwilling to reduce their holdings.</p>

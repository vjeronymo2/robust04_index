			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Record volume in Glaxo DRUGS group Glaxo stunned the investment community with a generous dividend payment, prompting a rush of buying that left the shares up 27p at the close. The rise accounted for 5.32 points on the FT-SE 100 Index. It was accompanied by turnover of 24m shares, which matched the record volume and sharp share falls registered in March when Dr Ernest Mario, the former chief executive, resigned. Yesterday, Dr Richard Sykes, Dr Mario's replacement, took advantage of an increase in the company's cash pile to Pounds 1.8bn to flag his first results presentation with a dividend of 22p, against expectations of around 20p. Glaxo had previously said it would not allow dividend cover to fall below two times but yesterday's payout took cover to 1.8 times and the company said it would be prepared to see it fall further. Analysts who had been very cautious on the stock, including the pharmaceuticals teams at James Capel and Lehman Brothers, were taken by surprise. Capel kept its current year profits forecast at Pounds 1.92bn but raised its dividend prediction from 23p to 26p a share and moved to a 'hold' from a 'sell' stance. Lehman increased its profits estimate by Pounds 35m to Pounds 1.925bn. Meanwhile, SG Warburg turned buyer and Mr James Culverwell of Hoare Govett, already a buyer on yield considerations, said: 'People have overlooked the capacity for the company to pay a dividend even when the outlook is uncertain.' Glaxo shares raced ahead 40 on the news and consolidated to close a net 27 up at 628p.</p>

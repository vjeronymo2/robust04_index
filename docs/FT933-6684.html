			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / Letters to the Editor: Political differences are impeding European monetary union (2) Sir, Christopher Johnson proposes another half-baked scheme for monetary union in response to the collapse of the previous one. Immediately the goal of monetary union for members of a currency area is set, the scope for speculation is increased. It is sensible and almost inevitable in the interim period before the introduction of the single currency that the markets will test the resolve of the authorities to remain on track. I am less convinced than Mr Johnson that the UK is underestimating the will of its European partners to achieve monetary union. The final decision is political not economic. When political resolve has been properly tested, as at the time of German currency reunification, it has failed. While the goal of monetary union based upon monetary stability is entirely laudable, it is imperative that the political arguments are won before the economic arguments begin again.

After the examination of the points on the  agenda, the cabinet made some decisions. Idrissa Camara has  more:    [Camara] [passage omitted] Regarding the Ministry of  Territorial Administration and Security, the cabinet heard a  written report on the consultative meeting on displaced Malians  currently living in southern Algeria held from 25 to 26 November  in Geneva, Switzerland, and the meeting held in Nouakchott from  13 to 14 December on the repatriation and socioeconomic  rehabilitation of Malian refugees in Mauritania.    The signing of the National Pact on 11 April 1992 between  the  Government of the Republic of Mali and the Unified Movement and  Front of the Azawad witnessed the end of the rebellion in  northern Mali and the announcement of the return and  socioeconomic rehabilitation of the people who took refuge in  the neighboring countries. Due to the progressive  reestablishment of security in the northern areas, the refugees  are increasingly desirous of returning to their country of  origin.    It is in order to organize and rationalize the different  repatriation and rehabilitation operations that these  consultative meetings were held with our partners -- in Geneva  with the UNHCR, the International Fund for Agricultural  Development [IFAD], and the Algerian Government representatives,  and in Niasso with the UNHCR and Mauritanian Government  representatives. The two meetings enabled the establishment of  a viable institutional framework for the return and  rehabilitation of the Malian refugees, the working out of a  monitoring system for the repatriation operations, and support  from the UNHCR, IFAD, and the countries of refuge in the  implementation of the repatriation operations.    The two meetings permitted the establishment of the bases  for  a rational examination of a strategic approach to the problems  related to the return of Malian refugees in Mauritania and  southern Algeria.

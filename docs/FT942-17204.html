			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / Suez returns to FFr1.6bn profit Suez, one of France's largest industrial and financial holding companies, yesterday confirmed that it returned to the black in 1993 with a net profit of FFr1.57bn (Pounds 184m) against a net loss of FFr1.87bn the previous year. The group, which in 1992 fell into the red for the first time in its 135-year history because of the financial pressures on its banking and property interests, expected to continue its recovery this year. The board proposed freezing the dividend at FFr8.20 a share for 1993. However, Suez's rebound concealed a widely varying performance across the group. Societe Generale de Belgique, the Belgian holding company, fared well, as did Indosuez, the group's main investment banking subsidiary, and Victoire, its insurance business. The strong performance of these subsidiaries enabled Suez to produce an operating profit of FFr1.61bn in 1993, against an operating loss of FFr610m. Suez continued to suffer from the weakness of the French property market, forcing it to make further hefty provisions on the fall in value of its commercial property interests. Suez also faced additional problems within its banking businesses. The board yesterday authorised the recapitalisation of Credisuez, a financial subsidiary, in a FFr2bn restructuring package. This deal also involved Compagnie de Suez, another subsidiary, paying FFr1bn to purchase some of Credisuez's investments. Suez managed to compensate for the negative impact of its high provisions by making substantial gains from asset sales. Exceptional profits amounted to FFr4.35bn, compared with FFr1.64bn. Substantial deals included last autumn's disposal of Victoire's controlling interest in Colonia, the German insurer, to Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP), the French insurer. Suez, still burdened with heavy debts despite its recent disposals, hopes to make other asset sales this year. The group said it did not expect to suffer so badly from the property crisis. It anticipated further improvement from its banking businesses and another strong performance from Societe Generale de Belgique.</p>

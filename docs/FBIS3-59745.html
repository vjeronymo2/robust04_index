The spectral  technology developed is a ``resonance Raman gain spectrometer'',  and it is a high performance spectrometer that can grasp the  chemical changes of polymers as they change on the ultra short  time base of femtoseconds. The structural relaxation based on  the photo-excitation of PDA was anticipated by other methods,  but this is the first time that the structural changes have been  substantiated experimentally. PDA is a low level semiconductor  material, and it is expected that PDA will have applications in  non-linear optical materials. It is thought that in the future  this new spectrometer will be very powerful in the analysis of  the functions and structures of non-linear optical materials.    Up to this point, this type resonance Raman gain spectrum  and  temporal analysis type device had been a very difficult and  awkward detection method, and the research group of Assistant  Professor Kobayashi was the first to develop it as a means for  observing the changes of molecular combinations of polymers that  change instantly on the level of several hundred femtoseconds.  The device has an actual temporal analysis capacity to measure  the spectrum in several hundred femtoseconds.    It is expected that the electron spectrum data relating to  the principle chain structure relaxation of PDA will greatly  expand the electron spectrum data gathered so far involving  changes in polymers. However, it cannot be said that the  electron spectrum directly reflects the structure of atoms and  molecules, and it has been necessary to specify the structure by  observing atoms and molecules using an oscillation spectrum  based on their internal oscillations.    As a temporal analysis oscillation spectral measurement  methods, up to this point there have been: temporal analysis  infrared absorption; resonance natural emission Raman  dispersion; and the resonance coherent anti-Stokes Raman  dispersion method or the so-called CARS method. However, in  these methods of oscillation spectral observation, there are the  problems of an insufficient temporal resolution and of a great  amount of noise because the structural relaxation of polymer  excitons occurs instantaneously on the femtosecond base.  Therefore, these methods are lacking a decisive feature.    With the new technology, there is very little background  signal noise, and it has ultra high resolution on the level of  several hundred femtoseconds. In the observations of PDA this  time, as expected, signals were observed indicating that the  structure of the free exciton changed by photo-excitation in  less than 200 femtoseconds from the acetylene type to the  butatriene type. The mechanism by which non-linear optical  materials bring about these changes instantly will be clarified  by the equipment developed, and conversely, the equipment will  spur on the development of future functional optical materials  by playing a role in the development of new non-linear optical  materials.</p>

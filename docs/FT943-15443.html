			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / Man from Auntie goes on global mission Last Friday, with no fanfare, the BBC launched its 24-hour television news service for Japan. The English-language channel, delivered by satellite with four hours a day of translation into Japanese, has been created in partnership with Nissho Iwai, a Japanese trading and publishing company. Two weeks earlier, just as quietly, the BBC launched an Arabic-language service aimed at the Middle East. The satellite service is initially broadcasting for just two hours a day but will build up to a 24-hour service before the end of the year. The BBC is supplying the service under contract to Orbit Communications, a Rome-based subsidiary of Marawed, the Saudi Arabian trading group. The BBC had been expanding around the world with private-sector partners for some time before the government formally endorsed an international commercial role in Wednesday's white paper on the future of the corporation. The white paper not only underpinned all existing BBC services, but proposed that the corporation should have a new 10-year royal charter to run from 1997, with the continuation of the licence fee guaranteed until 2001. That too will almost certainly be a 10-year commitment. But the government has ambitions for the BBC beyond continuing to serve its domestic audiences. The white paper says: 'The government believes the BBC should be able to evolve into an international multi-media enterprise, building on its present commercial services for audiences in this country and overseas.' Mr Bob Phillis, BBC deputy director-general and chairman of BBC Worldwide, a new organisation which brings together the corporation's commercial and international activities, is clear on both the opportunities and their limits. 'There is no plan to turn ourselves into a Time Warner or any of the great organisations like that. The aim is to build on assets produced for the domestic market and find ways of delivering them more effectively, packaged and presented in a different way,' he said. The BBC's commercial enterprises - which range from programme sales and magazines, such as the Radio Times, to videos and books - produced Pounds 66.6m to reinvest in programmes in the year to March - up 12 per cent on the year. Over the next 10 years Mr Phillis believes it may be possible to increase that sum to Pounds 200m - a significant sum but still dwarfed by the licence fee, which last year raised Pounds 1.6bn. Apart from regional television news there are no plans to produce programmes specifically for international markets. The BBC will be monitored by the government to ensure that its commercial activities are not subsidised by either the licence fee or by the government grants that fund the World Service. The first step was reorganising the structure of the Corporation's activities which, Mr Phillis believes, were not sufficiently co-ordinated in the past. Under BBC Worldwide there are three separate directorates: BBC World Service for radio, television - bringing together both programme sales and international broadcasting - and publishing. They will be organised into six regional groups: Europe; the former Soviet Union and south-west Asia; the Americas; Africa and the Middle East; south Asia and Asia-Pacific. The expansion of World Service Television will be funded mainly through private partnerships such as the new Japanese and Middle East services, with the BBC providing the programmes and expertise and the private partner providing the capital. The service lost Pounds 5m last year but is expected to break even this year. The next big step will be the launch before the end of this year of two satellite television services aimed at the European market - a news channel and an entertainment channel. Pearson, the media group which owns the Financial Times, is expected to put up a considerable proportion of the capital required. Investment will be on a project-by-project basis and will include other private-sector organisations. The BBC also hopes to launch one or two channels on US cable networks next year and has had talks with Cox, the Atlanta-based media group. However, the BBC will face competition in areas such as international news from CNN, the US cable network, while English-language channels will face the problem of being minority channels in non-English speaking countries. The BBC will also be examining new interactive services and the education and language tuition market. Mr Phillis said: 'There are all sorts of possibilities which we are just beginning to explore. The whole basis of our approach is the realistic, step-by-step taking of opportunities as and when they arise.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 28 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata  on Tuesday welcomed the agreement between North and South Korea  to hold their first summit meeting next month, saying it is  "good news."    North and South Korean officials agreed earlier in the day  to  hold a meeting of their leaders in Pyongyang on July 25-27,  followed by a second meeting at a later date, with the place  still to be decided.    The summit would also have a good effect on the relations  between Japan and North Korea, Hata told reporters.    On the prospects for Japanese economic and technological  assistance to North Korea, Hata predicted smooth progress if the  nuclear issue is settled in forthcoming high-level talks between  the United States and North Korea.</p>

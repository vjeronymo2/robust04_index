			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 31 (KCNA) -- Publications of  different countries hit out at the U.S. acts of aggravating the  situation of the Korean peninsula.    The Zairean paper LA REFERENCE said the United States,  styling itself the "only superpower" in the world after the  collapse of the Soviet Union and East European socialist  countries, is trying to bring all countries under its control,  and that North Korea has become a target of such strongarm  politics of the United States.    The Nigerian paper DAILY CHAMPION said the United States has  broken down the third-round DPRK-U.S. talks and deployed Patriot  missiles in South Korea, and this will only heighten the crisis.    A recent issue of the Nepalese paper NEPAL NEWS said the  United States decided to resume the "Team Spirit" joint military  exercises and deployed Patriot missiles recently under the  pretext of the North's fictitious "nuclear issue". This shows  that they have become an object of hatred by answering North  Korea's peaceful efforts with confrontation, wrote the paper.    The may issue of the Nepalese magazine PURATIDHWANI said the  United States invented Korea's "nuclear issue" and has  aggravated the situation of the Korean peninsula on that pretext  with the aim of destroying the Democratic People's Republic of  Korea, a genuine socialist country embodying the chuche idea.    The April issue of another Nepalese magazine MULYANGKAN said  the United States' impudent demand for an opening of North  Korea's military sites is, to all intents and purposes, a  provocative move to force a new war.</p>

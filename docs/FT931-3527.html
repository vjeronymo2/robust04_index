			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Facing a cultural shift at the coalface - Miners' unions remain sceptical about changing work patterns WORKPLACE reform is expected to be a vital ingredient in the government's white paper on the coal industry. The viability of all Britain's pits, not just those facing immediate closure, will be seen to depend on the willingness of miners to accept sweeping new labour practices. British Coal requires changing work patterns to cut deep-mine operating costs by 28 per cent over the next five years and raise output per man-shift from 5.95 tonnes to 9.37 tonnes by 1997-98. Managers say this will mean a sharp break with the working culture that has dominated the industry since nationalisation in 1947. They want an end to what they see as an over-centralised bureaucratic structure where unions exercise substantial power over decision-making. The recent Commons trade and industry committee report stressed the need to reform working practices 'including the passing of any necessary legislation where this would reduce costs without compromising safety'. The unions remain sceptical. They see reform as the end of the joint consultation system that gave them enormous influence in the workplace. British Coal wants more power for local managers. The Department of Trade and Industry is pressing ministers for a repeal of the five-day-week agreement which sets the length of a miner's shift and the operating week from Monday to Friday. 'We would not seek to increase the amount of working time per man but to repackage it into fewer long attendances, some of which could be rostered for the weekend,' British Coal said in a private briefing paper. 'The colliery would work more intensively to achieve lower costs, but each man would not work more hours.' It believes miners would not resist longer shifts and more flexible working patterns. British Coal believes, for example, that longer shifts are advantageous in the north-east where men face long travelling times to the coalface. A 10-hour shift working the same basic hours over a period of eight weeks would mean a miner working 29 10-hour shifts as opposed to 40 shifts of 7 1/4 hours. This would give miners an extra 11 days off over the eight-week period and in a full year more than 60 additional days off. British Coal also wants to amend the Mines and Quarries Acts to increase efficiency in administration by simplifying procedures without endangering safety. On top of this it is demanding repeal of section 46 of the Coal Industry Nationalisation Act which lays down joint consultation and conciliation procedures. At present all unions are unenthusiastic but their members may be more willing to adapt. Certainly in the eight years since the miners' strike miners have shown their readiness to accept an enormous shake-up in the industry. There has been a 79 per cent cut in manpower on the coalfields, with the loss of 135,000 men. The number of collieries has dropped from 133 to 50 while output per man shift has climbed from 2.72 tonnes to 5.31 tonnes. British Coal argues that in a more decentralised, market-driven industry the working practice reforms could ensure that UK miners become even more competitive against those overseas. Only in this way, it says, can they expect to ensure the survival of their industry.</p>

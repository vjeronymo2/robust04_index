The FHWA recognizes that IRI does have some limitations. It does, however, provide a common quantitative basis with which to reference the different measures of roughness. Further, it is currently collected by SHAs and provided to FHWA under the Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS) submission requirements. Although the FHWA is open to use of improved pavement surface rideability measures, until such time that improved measures and equipment to measure them are accepted and readily available to SHA's, the FHWA will continue to rely on IRI as the ride indicator.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Four SHAs commented that the specific IRI criteria of 240 cm/km (150 inches/mile) was too severe. The FHWA disagrees. The selection of the 240 cm/km upper limit criteria on pavement roughness was directly tied to the FHWA's desire to require Interstate pavement to be in fair or better condition. The interim policy noted that initial IRI to pavement serviceability rating <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  (PSR) conversion studies <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  indicated a 240 cm/km IRI is equivalent to a PSR range of 3.0 to 3.5. Pavements within this range are classified as fair in the FHWA's ``1992 Highway Statistics'' <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  report. Subsequent additional analysis of the IRI/PSR correlation indicates that a 240 cm/km IRI more accurately reflects a much lower PSR range of 2.5 to 2.8 (pavements in this range are classified as being in poor to mediocre condition <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE> ). Based on this further analysis, the FHWA has established an upper limit of allowable IRI of 200 cm/km (127 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;/mile). This converts to a PSR of between 2.8 and 3.2 which is more consistent with the FHWA's original objective that pavements be in fair or better condition <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The PSR concept was developed at the 1956 American Association of State Highway Officials (AASHO) road test to relate the pavement serviceability index (PSI), computed from objectively measured pavement distress, with subjective serviceability ratings by panels of road users.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Bashar Al-Omari and Michael I.

No comments were received concerning the appropriateness of the rutting indicator or the established criteria. Therefore the FHWA has retained 15 mm (5/8 inch) as the upper allowable limit of rutting. Concerns related to data collection equipment and procedures are addressed under ``Pavement Data Collection,'' later in the preamble.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Faulting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The SHA comments on the faulting criteria were split evenly; five SHAs thought that the faulting criteria were too restrictive, while five SHAs commented that the criteria were acceptable. In addition, the HUFSAM found the criteria acceptable. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Clinton tougher on plutonium production PRESIDENT Bill Clinton has stiffened his opposition to the production of plutonium even for civil purposes, in a move that could pose yet another challenge to the UK's controversial Thorp nuclear fuel reprocessing plant. In a letter to members of Congress, Mr Clinton said continued production of plutonium, even for civil purposes, was 'not justified on either economic or national security grounds, and its accumulation creates serious proliferation and security dangers'. The statement marks a step forward from the Clinton administration's non-proliferation policy issued in September. In that document, the White House said only that it would 'seek to eliminate where possible the accumulation of stockpiles of highly-enriched uranium or plutonium, and to ensure that where these materials already exist, they are subject to the highest standards of safety, security and international accountability'. Thorp, which has been built in Cumbria by British Nuclear Fuels at a cost of Pounds 2.8bn, is expected to produce about 60 tons of plutonium over the next decade if a British government review allows it to start up. Opponents of the plant have argued that this addition to the already large global stockpile of plutonium can only increase the risk that weapons-grade nuclear material might end up in the hands of terrorists or rogue governments. Congressman Pete Stark, the California Democrat who has led US opposition to the start-up of Thorp, said that Mr Clinton's letter sent 'a clear message that the US does not want this plant to begin operation'. British officials, however, said they had received no representations from the US administration about Thorp. Mr Clinton says in his letter that he has not called for a ban on all production of fissile nuclear material because this would breach existing US commitments and could lead to confrontation with Russia and the US's allies. Congressional aides said, however, that the US's commitments are not to Thorp itself but to its biggest customers, Japan and Switzerland. 'We have no existing commitment to support Thorp,' a congressional staff member said. Mr Clinton says non-proliferation policy is one of his top priorities, but the administration's position appears still to be evolving as it seeks to unravel some of the entanglements which have been created in recent years. The administration must walk a tightrope between curbing the spread of plutonium or highly-enriched uranium, which could potentially be made into bombs, while at the same time not imposing such a tight rein that it hampers other countries' peaceful nuclear programmes, possibly even provoking some to drop out of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which is due for renewal in 1995. 'We have a lot of sympathy for the US's non-proliferation goals, but the US has to prove itself a reliable partner,' one European official commented.</p>

			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / People: Wileman to find 'a vision for Sears' Sears, the retail group that includes the Selfridges department store and chains such as Olympus, Miss Selfridge, Warehouse, and Adams, is splitting the role of corporate development director - which had become 'too big for one person' - to create a new post of strategy director. The man brought in to fill the post by chief executive Liam Strong is Andrew Wileman, 39, until now head of the retail practice at OC&amp;C, the strategy consultancy. Strong was impressed by Wileman when OC&amp;C was carrying out consultancy work for Sears. Although the position is not at board level, Wileman will work closely with Strong on 'coming up with a vision for Sears', the group says. The task of restructuring Sears has been likened to turning round a flotilla, but Strong has had some success since arriving in February 1992. He has sold the group's menswear interests and the property arm Galliford, and rationalised the British Shoe Corporation. Wileman's job now, working closely with Jonathan Katz, the present corporate development director, will be to oversee the next phase: focusing on the retailing operations and making sure shops and products are in tune with what customers want. Wileman is expected to take a long-term view of strategy, looking at new ventures, and also at improving Sears' 'core retail skills' - including customer service, product sourcing, visual merchandising and marketing. Katz will be in charge of implementing the group's new operating plan.</p>

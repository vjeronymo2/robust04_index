			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Sergey Kovalev Considers President's </F> Edict Dangerous"]    [Text] S. Kovalev, chairman of the Russian Federation  president's Human Rights Commission, has sent a letter to B.  Yeltsin regarding his edict "On Urgent Measures To Protect the  Population From Banditry and Other Manifestations of Organized  Crime."    It is obvious to us, S. Kovalev writes, that it is necessary  to step up the fight against crime, the growth in which is  naturally of concern to all sectors of Russian society. The  work of law-enforcement organs, which are meant to conduct this  fight within the framework of existing legislation, needs  radical improvement. Needless to say, the possibility of  improving their work is not ruled out.    The tragic experience of Russia, S. Kovalev stressed, shows  that citizens' safety cannot be protected by violating the basic  rights and freedoms enshrined in Chapter 2 of the Russian  Constitution. It is no accident that Articles 64 and 135 of the  Constitution envisage a special procedure for making changes to  this chapter.    The conflicts with the norms of existing criminal procedural  legislation and the legally vague formulas used in the edict  create a possibility of its being interpreted as broadly as  people like, S. Kovalev believes, and he voices the fear that  implementation of the edict would be accompanied by arbitrary  actions by law-enforcement departments -- unjustified arrests,  interference in citizens' private and economic activities, and a  growth in corruption among officials. This, in particular, is  confirmed by reports from the Republic of Bashkortostan and  Tatarstan, where similar acts of legislation are already in  force.    Under the Constitution, the letter goes on to say, you, as  Russian president, are the guarantor of the rights and freedoms  of the individual and the citizen. We are confident that you do  not share the concept espoused by certain leaders of power  structures who think that the rights of some citizens can be  protected by violating the rights of others. This approach  shows that we have still not learned the lessons of our own past.    The edict you have signed is also dangerous because, by  pursuing short-term political advantage, it essentially  undermines respect for the law and faith in the stability of the  recently adopted Constitution.    The letter concludes with a request from the Human Rights  Commission for B. Yeltsin to suspend Edict No. 1226 of 14 June  1994.</p>

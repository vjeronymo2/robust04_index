			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Tagamet boost for Beecham THE announcement from UK drug authorities that an ulcer treatment from SmithKline Beecham would be considered for over the counter (OTC) approval boosted the shares, which advanced 11 to 436p with 3.5m traded. Pharmaceutical analysts said the decision on Tagamet by the Committee on the Safety of Medicines, which came after the stock market session on Tuesday, was a good development for the group. Tagamet, an important product in SmithKline's armoury, is the first drug in its area of anti-ulcer treatment to receive this level of approval, and full official blessing for sales without prescription will greatly enhance its market share. SmithKline's advance was mirrored in a perky health and household sector. Wellcome jumped 20 to 678p, dealers attributing this largely to a technical correction after recent weakness. Bespak surprised the sceptics who had been forecasting a dent in the group's profits, posting a good increase and improving the dividend. The shares made some recovery from the dramatic losses incurred in recent sessions and closed 56 up at 518p.</p>

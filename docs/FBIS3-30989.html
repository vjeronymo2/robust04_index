			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovene </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] In light of some newspapers writing about the  alleged replacement of U.S. Ambassador Alan Wendt [as heard],  the Slovene Government, the U.S. Embassy, and the Defense  Ministry have issued statements:    In its statement, the Slovene Government emphasizes that it  has no knowledge of any replacements and that it favors  strengthening good relations with Washington in all spheres.  The hitherto good cooperation is, to a great extent, also a  result of the work and efforts of the U.S. Embassy in Ljubljana.  [passage omitted]    The claims of the U.S. Embassy were also supported by our  Defense Ministry. A brief statement says that Lieutenant  (Leach) has, from 3 November 1993, lead very successfully a  liaison group within the Army to Army program, which is aimed at  exchanging experiences in the military sphere. Claims that  Lieutenant (Leach) has been recalled is insulting to Mr. Leach  -- who has, in the meantime, become a great friend of our  country -- and harms diplomatic efforts, the international  reputation of Slovenia, and cooperation of our ministry with the  U.S. Defense Ministry, the Defense Ministry statement says.</p>

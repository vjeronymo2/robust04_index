			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / People: Bowing to Japanese wisdom Inchcape, the motor and business services group, has appointed a senior Japanese executive, Hachiro Koyama, as non-executive chairman of the UK company's Japanese subsidiary, Inchcape Dodwell. Koyama, 70, is vice-president of the Nikkeiren employers' federation in Japan and also representative director and chairman of SmithKline Beecham there. He previously held executive positions with Standard Vacuum Oil, Mobil Oil and Johnson Wax Japan. Charles Mackay, Inchcape's chief executive, says the appointment of someone of Koyama's stature underlines the importance of Japan to Inchcape, and the group's efforts to develop a strong cadre of Japanese management. The Tokyo-based subsidiary employs 2,000 people, nearly all of whom are Japanese. Inchcape's motors business in Japan consists of a new joint venture with Peugeot to import and distribute the French group's cars, and a Mercedes-Benz dealership in Tokyo. The UK group also represents nine Japanese manufacturers, such as Toyota and Mazda, in world markets. Inchcape's Japanese marketing businesses in Japan cover consumer goods, industrial products and business machines, and its service businesses are involved in shipping, insurance and testing. In January Sir John Whitehead, former British ambassador to Japan, was appointed to advise Inchcape's London board on Japanese affairs. Inchcape has also announced the retirement of Peter Laister, 64, after nearly 10 years as a non-executive director. A former chairman of Thorn-EMI and the Maxwell Communication Corporation, Laister will now concentrate on his other business interests, including the chairmanship of the Nimbus Group of companies, which are involved in records, compact discs and CD-ROM technology to store technical information.</p>

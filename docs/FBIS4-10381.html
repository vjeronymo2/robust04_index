			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Monitored in progress] </F>   [Text] ...by 11 of 13 votes, thanks notably to the votes of  eight senators elected in the contested partial legislative  elections of 18 January 1993 and not acknowledged by the  international community. Article 149 stipulates that in the  event of a vacancy in the Presidency of the Republic for any  reason, the president of the Court of Cassation is invested  provisionally with the powers of president of the Republic by  the National Assembly, duly convened by the prime minister. It  stipulates also that new presidential elections will take place  within 45 to 90 days after the beginning of the vacancy.    In this precise case, the senators pointed out that the  elections, which will be presidential, legislative, municipal,  and local, could be held after the 90-day deadline in order to  respect the constitutional electoral calendar. The  parliamentarians who passed this resolution intend to send it to  the Chamber of Deputies on 11 April and to inform the president  of the Court of Cassation, Emile Jonassaint, of their decision.    No senators from the National Front for Change and Democracy  or the [Constitutionalist] Anticorruption Alliance were seen at  the 10 April session, where political leaders spoke. The leaders  of Mobilization for National Development [MDN, headed by Hubert  de Ronceray], Haitian Party of God [the Reverend Richard  Vladimir Jeanty], and Democratic National Rally Party [Constant  D. Pognon] explained the resolution of the Coordinating  Committee for National Mobilization [CCMN].    After the vote, the MDN leader expressed his satisfaction  and  made the following clarification before the microphone of  Leontes Dorzilme:    [Begin De Ronceray recording, in Creole] You must not  confuse  the stance of CCMN and that of MDN. The latter takes and always  has taken a stand in favor of Justice Joseph C. Nerette, whereas  CCMN has never cited any name. It merely demands the  implementation of Article 149 with the formation of a  provisional, ad hoc government. It does not specify any names.  So, we cannot say CCMN is satisifed or dissatisfied with Justice  Jonassaint or Justice Nerette. I would like to make this  distinction: This problem concerns MDN and does not concern  CCMN. [end recording]    It should be recalled that the Chamber of Deputies has  already approved a plan for the resolution of the crisis. This  plan is backed by the United States and the United Nations and  is not yet supported by the opposing bloc of the Senate headed  by Senator Firmin Jean-Louis, who is acknowledged by the  international community.    For his part, President Jean-Bertrand Aristide has rejected  this plan, which provides for the installation of a prime  minister after the early retirement of the head of the Army,  General Raoul Cedras, but sets no date for his return to Haiti.    It must also be said that the resolution passed on 10 April  states that the new provisional president will have to handle  the international embargo against Haiti.</p>

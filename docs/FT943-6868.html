			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Rentokil Given its remarkable record and self-confident management Rentokil's figures are rightly given a very thorough going over by the City. Yesterday's interims were found wanting. It was not merely that the group met its long-standing target of 20 per cent earnings growth by the merest whisker. It was the underlying improvement that caused concern. Excluding the excellent contribution from Securiguard, earnings would have risen by around 14 per cent, positively pedestrian by Rentokil's standards. In continental Europe recession bit deeper than expected. But in Australia Rentokil had only itself to blame and, while the management problems have been tackled, it will take some time for the benefits to work through. In contrast the figures from Securiguard were very encouraging and should lay to rest any lingering doubts about the acquisition. The swift improvement in margins to 6.9 per cent suggests it was right to argue there is a market for high quality security services. The company's confidence that margins can reach into double figures within two years looks well-founded. Its success also provides a new business area into which Rentokil can funnel its mounting cash pile through bolt-on acquisitions. The results should not undermine investor confidence in Rentokil's prospects and, after yesterday's fall, the share rating is near its low relative to the market. Yet the premium is still almost 30 per cent and, as the reaction to the last figures in March showed, the market takes a while to get over a disappointment.</p>

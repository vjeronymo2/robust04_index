			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / Australian jobless down AUSTRALIA'S politically sensitive unemployment rate dipped to 10.8 per cent in September from 10.9 per cent in August, but economists said the prospects for further reductions appeared to be slim. Government figures showed that the reduction in unemployment was entirely due to a fall in the number of people seeking work. The number of people employed fell by 44,000, following a fall of 17,000 in August. Mr Kim Beazley, employment minister, welcomed the fall and said the underlying trend suggested that the 'shake-out' in employment was coming to an end. However, economists said the figures showed that Australia's recovery from the 1990-1991 recession remained disappointingly slow.</p>

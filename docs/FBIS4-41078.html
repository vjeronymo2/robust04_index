			<p>BFN     [Text] Today Eduard Shevardnadze, the Georgian head of  state and chairman of parliament, received Russian Ambassador to  Georgia Vladimir Zemskiy. The ambassador presented to the head  of state a letter from Boris Yeltsin in which the Russian  president thanks Eduard Shevardnadze for his message of  greetings on Russian Independence Day, and expresses confidence  that friendship and cooperation between Russia and Georgia will  continue for the benefit of the two countries' peoples.    The two discussed today's decision by Russia's Federation  Council, authorizing the deployment of Russian peacekeeping  forces in the conflict zone in Abkhazia. The head of state said  that the decision is very important. He stressed that this  international initiative by Russia is of historic importance not  only for Georgia, and that its success would be a prerequisite  for stability in the Transcaucasus. In the opinion of Eduard  Shevardnadze, the success of the operation will boost Russia's  international reputation, and would be a positive example to  other countries.</p>

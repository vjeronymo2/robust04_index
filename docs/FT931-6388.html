			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Street-Porter paid via company THE BBC'S head of Youth and Entertainment Features, Ms Janet Street-Porter, is paid as a freelance through her own private company. Janet Street-Porter Ltd is a company set up principally 'to provide and promote the services of Miss Janet Street-Porter in broadcast, journalism, films and television'. The company had a turnover of Pounds 94,256 last year, according to records which have been filed at Companies House. This would have included other freelance earnings apart from her BBC salary. The company had distribution costs of Pounds 9,775 and administrative expenses of Pounds 39,364, leaving an operating profit of Pounds 45,117. For the past four years Ms Street-Porter has been a senior programme executive at the BBC, but is a freelance on two-year contracts. Last year she paid corporation tax of Pounds 11,515. Last night the BBC declined to discuss Ms Street-Porter's payment arrangements. Ms Street-Porter said in a statement that she had been 'a freelance for over 20 years, including broadcasting, writing books, journalism, television presentation and television production'. She added that her last contract with the BBC ran out at the end of December 1992 and that arrangements for a new one were still under discussion. It is apparently not unusual for heads of department at the BBC not to be members of staff. Mr Jonathan Powell, who resigned as controller of BBC1 in December, was never on the staff of the BBC. His successor Mr Alan Yentob always has been. London Weekend Television confirmed last night that four executives were paid in part through private companies. They are Mr Marcus Plantin, former director of programmes who is now ITV's network director; Mr Greg Dyke, chief executive and also non-executive chairman of GMTV, the breakfast television company; Mr Barry Cox, director of corporate affairs; and Mr Brian Tesler, former managing director of the company. The LWT annual accounts make clear that part of the services of all four is paid in this way. In each case it is believed the main part of the salaries are paid to them as employees. Mr Dyke's company, Vine Productions, had a turnover of Pounds 52,810 in the year to March 1991 and made a profit of Pounds 32,503. Payment through a service company in ITV has been less usual in recent years because of the growth of share option schemes. The Inland Revenue said that only employees and full-time directors of companies are eligible for share options. Full-time directors of a company cannot be executive directors of another company. Other benefits such as profit-sharing schemes and redundancy pay are also linked to employee status. Meanwhile, there was widespread agreement yesterday, before Mr Birt's change of heart, that his method of payment was untenable for a director-general of the BBC. Senior broadcasters who met yesterday to start the organisation of the next Royal Television Society Cambridge convention saw it as 'extraordinary behaviour'. They decribed it as a moral issue. The political reaction to the revelations about Mr Birt's salary was low-key. The general feeling at across the parties at Westminster was that it was up to the BBC to determine the details of Mr Birt's remuneration package.</p>

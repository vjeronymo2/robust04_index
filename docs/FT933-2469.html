			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Proudfoot halved at Pounds 5.6m - Shares fall sharply and interim dividend cut by two-thirds SHARES in Alexander Proudfoot, the troubled management consultancy group chaired by Lord Stevens of Ludgate, dropped 51p to 76p yesterday, as it announced halved first half 1993 profits and a big cut in the interim dividend. Pre-tax profits from continuing operations tumbled from Pounds 13.2m to Pounds 5.6m, and the group warned that it would 'do well to match the first-half pre-tax profit in the second half'. Under FSR 3 accounting rules, there was a pre-tax loss of Pounds 13.6m (Pounds 12m profit) after taking a loss from discontinued operations of Pounds 19.1m. This relates to the closure in April of its Indevo operations in Sweden and Norway and represents a goodwill provision of Pounds 15.1m, plus trading losses of Pounds 1.4m and closure cost provisions of Pounds 2.6m. Mr David Gill, finance director since May, said that the recession in Europe and tough trading conditions worldwide for consultancy businesses had hit turnover and profits. Turnover from continuing operations fell by 9 per cent to Pounds 79.4m (Pounds 87.1m). Philip Crosby, the managment consultancy which is predominantly US-based, accounted for Pounds 3.6m of the Pounds 7.7m decline in turnover. This translated into a Pounds 7.6m decline in profits from continuing operations because of high fixed costs and the strength of the dollar. Mr Gill said the reaction had been a cost reduction programme on people, facilities and telecommunications which would lead to annualised savings of Pounds 15m. The interim results included Pounds 700,000 of costs related to the programme, and a further Pounds 800,000 would follow in the second half. At the end of the first half the group had net cash and investments of Pounds 9m. However, this had fallen to Pounds 4.6m as a result of the 1992 dividend payment and difficult summer trading conditions in Europe. Adjusted earnings per share were 5.2p, down from 22.8p. The loss per share after taking in the loss from discontinued operations was 26.3p. The interim dividend has been cut from 6p to 2p a share. This represented about 40 per cent of earnings per share from continuing operations - a formula which it would follow in future. A scrip dividend alternative will be offered. COMMENT The best that can be said of Proudfoot is that at long last it appears to be taking some of the necessary action for recovery. The new management's decision to cut the dividend sharply is sensible house-keeping. However, the cost savings of Pounds 15m a year appear to have been achieved remarkably cheaply for a people-based business. This could transform the business but nothing dramatic is likely to happen this year as recession grips continental Europe. Full-year profits of Pounds 8.5m give a p/e of 9, reflecting uncertainty.</p>

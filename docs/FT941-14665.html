			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / UK Company News: ICI India sells fertiliser operations for Pounds 25m ICI India, the Indian affiliate of ICI, the British diversified chemicals group which is undergoing large-scale restructuring, is selling its fertiliser operations for about Pounds 25m. The company yesterday announced the move, which followed the disposal of a 49 per cent stake in its polyester fibres business for Pounds 16m last year. ICI India, 51 per cent-owned by ICI, is responding to pressures created by the Indian government's economic liberalisation programme, launched in 1991, which is driving companies to reorganise their activities and concentrate resources on operations which appear to have the best potential and sell others. The fertiliser division is a substantial part of ICI India, accounting for 40 per cent of total turnover of Rs9.8bn (Pounds 209.4m) for the year to last March. Fibres made up a further 13 per cent. ICI India said the sales would leave the group free to focus on its remaining business including explosives, paints and chemical catalysts. No further big disposals were planned. The company denied that the disposals showed any lack of confidence in India's reforms. 'Our view is that the chances mean we must focus on businesses and really go for the products where we are strong,' said a senior official. ICI India is selling the fertiliser business to the GP Goenka group, a diversified chemicals and agricultural products combine. In addition to the purchase price, ICI India is to receive outstanding fertiliser production subsidy payments from the Indian government of about Pounds 20m. The stake in the fibres operations was sold to companies linked to Reliance Industries, India's largest chemicals group.</p>

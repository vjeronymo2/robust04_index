			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / The Markets: In praise of the international monetary non-system - Economic Eye The floating exchange rate non-system comes of age this month. It was 21 years ago, in March 1973, that the attempt to sustain the postwar system of fixed but adjustable exchange rates was abandoned. But that is not the only anniversary. It was also 50 years ago, in July 1944, that the conference at Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, designed the system that expired in 1973. It is timely, therefore, to ask whether the global system of dirty floating either will, or should, endure for the next 21 years, or more. The answer is that it both will and should. Floating exchange rates have had relatively few friends and many enemies. Yet nothing successful has been put in their place. Small countries are able to make credible commitments to fixed exchange rates, be it through currency boards (in the case of Hong Kong, for example), the ERM (in the case of the Netherlands) or just a unilateral target (in the case of Austria). Large countries find it far more difficult. Even France, most devoted to the cause of fixed exchange rates of the members of the group of seven leading industrial countries, had to concede 15 per cent fluctuation bands within the ERM last summer. It looks as though the world must learn to stop worrying and love floating exchange rates. Would that be so bad? The chart shows what has happened to exchange rates of the three major currencies - the dollar, the yen and the D-Mark - since 1971, the year when President Nixon's administration devalued the dollar, a decision that led ultimately to generalised floating. Five points emerge: there is a considerably amount of short term 'noise' in the movement of nominal exchange rates; there was one huge swing in nominal exchange rates, which began in 1980 and ending in 1987; that swing went into reverse in early 1985, well before the celebrated meeting of the G7 finance ministers at the Plaza Hotel in New York; there has been a fairly close correlation between swings in nominal and real exchange rates, although this has been less true for the D-Mark than for the other two, because Germany is shielded by the ERM; there have now been some seven years of reasonable exchange rate stability. This last fact explains why schemes to reform the international monetary system - common in the mid-1980s - have ceased to attract much attention today. But it also helps put the earlier dollar 'bubble' in proper perspective. Neither credible exchange rate commitments nor intervention explain the long period of relative stability, at least after 1987. This underlines the point made by Professor Max Corden of the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies in Washington DC, in a book to be published later this year that 'managed floating is not incompatible with considerable exchange rate stability'.* The conditions for this are low and stable inflation in all participants and the absence of major shocks. Destabilising shocks do have to be major ones. Even the fall of the Berlin Wall resulted in only a modest appreciation of the D-Mark against the dollar, though it did lead to a meltdown in the more rigid ERM. In the mid-1980s, the non-system looked far more erratic. Now it is possible to recognise that the ultimate cause of the rise of the dollar was an exceptionally large shock in the world's biggest economy: the tightening of monetary policy under Paul Volcker, chairman of the Federal Reserve, combined with the loosening of fiscal policy, under President Ronald Reagan. It is also unlikely that any other exchange rate system could have coped better with such a shock. Professor Corden's book, which shows just how economic analysis ought to be used to clarify important questions for an educated general public, indicates why. Suppose that it is accepted that the dollar had begun to overshoot seriously by 1983 and 1984, what would have been the consequences of using monetary policy to stop the trend? The likely answer, as we know from British experience with a similar bubble in 1987 and 1988, is that US inflation would have risen instead. It is possible that the total real exchange rate appreciation would then have been smaller. What is much more important is that the loss of competitiveness would have been more difficult to reverse under greater exchange rate stability. It would have required falling prices or at the least rapidly falling inflation, rather than the depreciation of the nominal exchange rate that occurred. Not only has the present non-system been functioning quite well for some years, it is also difficult to conceive of any workable alternatives. The fate of the ERM has demonstrated the vulnerability of any fixed exchange rate system with imperfect credibility and free capital movement. One alternative would be a credibly fixed exchange rate system, such as a currency board or, for large countries, a currency union. The only other would be a float, but the more explicitly the exchange rate is managed within the float, the greater its vulnerability to speculation. As Professor Corden puts it, 'the current laissez faire international monetary system is simply a market system, which co-ordinates the decentralised decisions reached by private and public actors and is likely to be as efficient at this as the market system within the domestic economy.' In other words, floating exchange rates among major currencies offer the worst possible system, except for all the others. * W Max Corden, Economic Policy, Exchange Rates, and the International System (Oxford: Oxford University Press, forthcoming).</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Bombay, Jan 30--The problem of aging of nuclear  reactors with the attendant radiation hazards poses a serious  challenge to nuclear scientists the world over with 400 of them  operational now.    According to Bhabha Atomic Research Centre director A.N.  Prasad, aging could create two problems, namely, reduction in  plant availability and--more importantly--safety. According to  estimates 160 to 170 plants of different designs would have  reached a service life of 25 years or more by the turn of the  century. About 60 of them would be more than 30 years old. In  addition, a very large number of research reactors would have to  be decommissioned, having reached the end of their service life  by that time. Most of these reactors were built when safety  standards were still being evolved and regulatory requirements  were much less stringent than now besides, the standards were  set with the available data on performance statistics of the  systems in relation to environmental factors.    Mr. Prasad said operating experience of nearly 6,000 reactor  years gained by the world nuclear community indicated that aging  affected all plant systems, support systems, components and  structures in varying degrees and heightened the risk to public  health and safety unless controlled.    Mr. Prasad said the problem of aging and related issues came  into focus in the first ever international symposium of the  international atomic energy agency in Vienna in 1987. Since then  work in the field had been intensive as well as extensive.  Studies led to identification of degradation of mechanisms such  as corrosion, irradiation-assisted stress corrosion cracking,  fatigues, wear due to flow-induced vibrations and embrittlement  due to aging. Various laboratories had undertaken detailed  studies of factors contributing to such degradation.    In nuclear facilities other than power plants, such as heavy  water plants, fuel fabrication plants, spent fuel reprocessing  plants and high level waste vitrification plants, though the  problem of aging was no less important, concerted efforts were  not as intense. However, safety requirements in these facilities  varied considerably. For instance, there was no serious risk of  spread of radioactivity from heavy water plants or uranium fuel  fabrication plants.    While reprocessing and vitrification plants carried a large  inventory of fissile materials and highly radioactive fission  products, the operations involved relatively passive and slow  systems. They do not experience high pressures and temperatures  like power reactors, but their equipment operate under harsh and  ambient conditions, particularly in the presence of highly  corrosive chemicals and high radiation fields. However, their  number was too small to generate adequate experience in the  field.    Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited managing director  S.K. Chatterjee says the enormous cost of adding new capacity  and lack of clearance for new sites for atomic stations had  forced planners to consider extending operation of existing  plants. This should be an important element in any nation's  strategy to meet its growing power needs.    Mr. Chatterjee said the prestigious Tarapur Atomic Power  Station (TAPS), which completes 25 years in April, has not run  its normal full course of design life and was now being readied  to operate for 40 full-power years. However, studies indicated  that there was ample margin in ductility of pressure vessels for  operation up to 40 full-power years.    In the light of stoppage of fuel supply from abroad and the  embargo on supply of critical spares. TAPS was proposed to be  run with indigenous Mixed Oxide Fuel (MOX) being developed along  with enriched uranium. Apart from in-house development of  spares, Indian industries were also being tapped for spares.  While the Electronic Corporation of India has developed neutron  detectors, the department of atomic energy has developed  feedwater spargers of modified design and this has been  fabricated by the industry.    Mr. Chatterjee said in order to tackle the problem of aging,  components were categorised as critical or otherwise depending  upon their potential to cause spread of radiation within and  outside the plant if they failed. New techniques were being  evolved to inspect components, particularly those with  accessibility problems and high radiation environment. New  plants were proposed to be designed to enable easy replacement  of such components. In the case of reactor vessels which undergo  neutron bombardment, measures such as their situ annealing were  being initiated to improve their ductility.    Other measures contemplated included reducing the number of  assemblies needed for the core.    Mr. Chatterjee said the carbon steel and shields of  Rajasthan  Atomic Power Station-I (RAPS-I) and Madras Atomic Power  Station-I (MAPS-I) were also likely to face the problem of  enbrittlement. However, switchover to coolant channels of  zirc-niobium alloy and stainless steel windshields had reduced  chances of the problem arising in MAPS-2 and Kaiga in Karnataka.    In the case of spent fuel reprocessing plants, aging led to  steady deterioration of solvent extraction columns due to  displacement of nozzle plates. There was also fouling and  choking of the process piping due to insoluble generated.  Besides, there was opaqueness of radiation shielding windows  vital for remote operation and maintenance due to deterioration  of oil, gaskets and plants by radiation.    The experience gained in the operation of the first plant at  Trombay to separate plutonium in the spent fuel discharged by  cirus. The research reactor gave insight to Indian scientists  into a number of problems of great significance to long-term  operations of such plants.</p>

			<p>920106 FT  06 JAN 92 / Fall in Abta membership last year was a record THE GULF war and the recession led last year to the UK's biggest annual net loss of travel agents and tour operators, according to figures published today by the Association of British Travel Agents. Abta said it granted membership to 180 travel agents last year but 346 went out of business, resulting in a net loss of 166. The most common reason for leaving Abta was financial failure, although 77 of the travel agents were taken over or merged with other companies. Seventy tour operators became Abta members, but 110 went out of business, including Mr Harry Goodman's International Leisure Group, which was then Britain's second-largest travel company. Abta said the rate of failures slowed during the year. In the fourth quarter 67 travel agents and 19 tour operators closed  - the lowest level since the summer of 1990. Abta said it expected the number of travel companies to continue to fall this year in spite of a 20 per cent increase in demand for winter breaks and an 8 per cent rise in summer holiday bookings.</p>

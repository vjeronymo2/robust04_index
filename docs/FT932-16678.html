			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / Florida overhauls state healthcare FLORIDA'S legislature has approved a far-reaching overhaul of the state's healthcare system that may foreshadow national reforms being considered by the Clinton administration. Governor Lawton Chiles said the plan would extend medical insurance to millions of people left out by the current system, and should serve as a model for national reform. The plan adopted in Florida follows the 'managed competition' principles that President Bill Clinton has said will form the framework of his reform, and will be applied on a wider scale than different schemes adopted in less populous states such as Oregon and Hawaii. The current Medicaid programme gives health coverage to low-income families and is sponsored by the federal government but paid for in part by the states. The programme is already the dominant factor in most state budgets, forcing them to consider ways of lowering medical costs, or at least curbing medical inflation. The heart of the Florida plan is the creation of 11 regional co-operatives that will act as purchasing pools to negotiate directly with doctors and hospitals for medical services. The pools will negotiate fixed annual fees with the providers. More than 2m people in Florida and 35m nationwide fall through the cracks in current provision. They have no health insurance provided by their employers but are not poor enough to qualify for Medicaid. Fitness plan for body and soul, Page 15</p>

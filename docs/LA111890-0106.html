			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE QUEEN OF DARKNESS;  </P> <P> THE WITCHING HOUR BY ANNE RICE (ALFRED A. KNOPF: $22.95; 965 PP.)  </P> <P> "The Witching Hour" unfolds like a poisonous lotus blossom redolent with  luxurious evil. Or so it would seem to a Medieval or "born -again" Christian.  For those Christians and non-Christians not fearful of stories about unearthly  powers, witches and secular resurrections, this novel will delight the senses.  </P> <P> Author Anne Rice uses her beloved New Orleans to good effect. Of all American  cities, it is the least Puritan and the most resistant to English priggishness.  </P> <P> Michael Curry, the primary male character and an impoverished native of this  delicious city, dies and is brought back to life by Rowan Mayfair, a woman of  science who happens to have magical powers. However, the price of resurrection  comes very high, and Michael is drawn into an ancient web spun for more than  three centuries by a dynasty of witches and a demon named Lasher -- souls,  undead, yet not alive either. They need Michael and Rowan for their purposes.  </P> <P> Rice thoroughly enjoys herself as she slides through 17th-Century France, the  fetid plantations in Port-au-Prince, the pain of the Civil War South and the  seeming "normalcy" of today's San Francisco and New Orleans.  </P> <P> The multiple generations of Mayfair women in the house on First Street are  strange. Generation after generation, since the first Mayfair woman landed on  American soil after fleeing a slave insurrection in Haiti, these women have had  incredible power. At least one female per generation, the one who wears the  Mayfair emerald, has exercised this power in worldly ways and has come to a  tragic, mournful end.  </P> <P> Rice must be wearing the Mayfair emerald herself, since she writes with  hypnotic power. In "The Witching Hour," as in her vampire chronicles, she  attacks the idea that good and evil are polar opposites. Renewal through  destruction and regeneration through violence drive the plots of Rice's  "supernatural" novels. This is a concept repellent and alien to Christians, but  something Hindus always have known. This idea allows Rice to create vampires,  witches and demons who can be figures that excite our compassion, most  especially in their deaths.  </P> <P> The execution of Comtesse Deborah Mayfair de Montcleve in September, 1689, in  the town of Montcleve, France, is one such scene. This beauty (the witches  always are beautiful) is accused by her mother-in-law of sleeping with Satan  and murdering her husband. The doomed Deborah at least enjoys melancholy  exaltation as she destroys her accusers by unleashing a storm upon their heads.  </P> <P> It's a scene that satisfies emotionally because the "bad guys" die. In the  hands of a less-skilled writer that's all this scene would have accomplished,  but Rice uses it to spur on a witness to this disaster, a former lover of  Deborah's, one Petyr van Abel. A student of witchcraft, he follows Deborah's  20-year-old daughter Charlotte (his daughter as it happens) to Port-au-Prince,  where she flees to escape a charge of witchcraft against herself.  </P> <P> Conveniently, Abel keeps a file on the Mayfair witches, which he sends to his  comrades in the Talamasca, an order formed in the 14th Century for the study of  the supernatural and whose members often possessed supernatural powers  themselves -- white witches, if you will.  </P> <P> Breaking up the time sequence of a novel always is a risky device. Using  epistles to advance the story is another volatile invention, because if the  reader does not like the first-person voice of the letter the thread is broken.  To Rice's credit, she makes the epistolary interruption work. The fact that the  letters are packed with sexual scrimmages (and incest, no less) helps.  Americans can swallow anything if sex is the lure.  </P> <P> What we're asked to swallow is a fascinating look at our ability to change  ourselves and those around us: Just how much free will do we really have? And,  are there intelligent spirits who share the Earth with us?  </P> <P> What we can't explain, we declare irrational or evil. What we can't understand,  we dismiss. What we can't control, we kill. And when we kill, we assign evil to  our victims, goodness to ourselves. Our victims can be Jews, homosexuals,  African-Americans; fill in the blanks. They are in some way seen as bad, as  devils, as subhuman or superhuman; either extreme is frightening.  </P> <P> The Devil in Western thought really represents responsibility. Polarizing human  behavior into a flat struggle between God and the Devil, good and evil, is an  elaborate rationalization for our infantilism, for the refusal to take  responsibility for our actions.  </P> <P> What makes Rice so fascinating is her obsession with this theme and her great  good sense never to discuss it in terms of nonfiction. It's hard to imagine a  Protestant writing in her ornate style. Her cherubims and seraphims of lust,  her incubi of desire, seem as gilded and sensual as baroque cathedrals,  buildings of exquisite sensuality dedicated to eradicating that same sensuality  in the flesh.  </P> <P> When she brings the story to our century, she uses a frail child, Deirdre  Mayfair, to confess to Father Mattingly that she sees a tall, dark, handsome  man. Years later this disturbed woman gives birth to an illegitimate child who  is packed away to California. This daughter, Rowan, has inherited all the  unholy power of the Mayfair women, although she knows nothing of Deborah  Montcleve's death in 1689, the New Orleans coven, the stories about her  great-grandmother as a voodoo queen, who had a purse of gold wherein each spent  coin returned to the purse by nightfall. But Rowan suffers premonitions -- or  are they ancestral memories? When she revives Michael and falls in love with  him, she is drawn back to her ancestors, back to the sweltering secrets of the  centuries, of the demon and the witches.  </P> <P> As the novel hurtles toward its conclusion, all of the characters from the  various epochs begin to interweave. There is even a character named Rita Mae,  which this reviewer found quite gratifying. Each character, sharply drawn, has  a card to play, a card that must be thrown at exactly the right time for  someone to hit the zygotic jackpot.  </P> <P> For that's what this novel is really about: putting flesh around our dreams,  flesh around our fears.  </P> <P> As Michael Curry, the hero, sits alone re-reading "Great Expectations" or  writing to make sense of his insane, or unsane, experiences with the witches,  he calms the reader, a necessary medication for this most uncalming book.  </P> <P> He says near the end: "Life must be founded upon the infinite possibility for  choice and accident. And if we cannot prove that it is, we must believe that it  is. We must believe that we can change, that we can control, that we can direct  our own destinies."  </P> <P> It is questionable whether Curry had a snowball's chance in hell of directing  his own destiny, but you can. Run right out to the bookstore and buy "The  Witching Hour." Rice has written her best novel yet. But I warn you: There's  the Devil to pay.  </P></p>

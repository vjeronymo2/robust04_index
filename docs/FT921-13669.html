			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / UAL says it faces biggest quarterly loss in its history UNITED AIRLINES, one of the three largest US carriers, warns that its fourth quarter will show the 'largest quarterly loss in the company's history'. This, said United, would 'substantially exceed the previous largest quarterly net loss of Dollars 157m (Pounds 87.7m) recorded in the first quarter of 1991'. That reflected terrorism fears during the Gulf war. United added that the quarterly loss would reflect 'among other things, a significant amount of non-recurring expenses'. This is the second time United has warned about the fourth-quarter figures. It suggested in December there would be a loss, although at that stage it blamed 'a weak domestic economy and a poor pricing environment'. On Friday the company declined to say why it had reissued the warning. The figures will be released on January 30. United's pessimism comes in the wake of a relatively encouraging announcement from American Airlines, one of its big rivals, last week. American suggested that some of the extreme ticket-discounting on domestic fares was abating, a sentiment which others echo. Although AMR, the parent company, posted a Dollars 124.9m loss in the final three months, the news prompted share price gains in the sector generally. United's shares have been particularly strong lately, as analysts have warmed to its Dollars 135m purchase of Pan Am's Latin American routes. Shares in UAL, the parent company, which were about Dollars 117 ahead of this transaction, closed on Friday at Dollars 156, down Dollars 3. The Pan Am assets may give United the most comprehensive global route structure; it already has a fairly strong Pacific presence and has been enhancing operations in Europe.</p>

			<p><P> October 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAM HALL KAPLAN: CLIFF MAY: DESIGNER OF DREAM HOUSES  </P> <P> Southern California has had more than its share of architects and designers who  have won worldwide attention -- Charles and Henry Greene for their exquisite  bungalows, R. M. Schindler and Richard Neutra for their modernist renditions,  John Lautner for his singular visions, and, most recently, Frank Gehry for his  constructivist exercises.  </P> <P> Then, in a class by himself outside the design establishment, is Cliff May, a  self-taught architect who was one of the most productive and successful  designer of houses here or anywhere.  </P> <P> May died 10 days ago at his office in Brentwood at the age of 81, generally  ignored by the profession's pedants, respected by the building trade, hailed by  his clients and loved by his friends.  </P> <P> Arguably, no other home designer who has ever practiced in Southern California  was more sensitive to the region's unique climate, evolving life styles and  rich architectural history than Cliff May.  </P> <P> It was May more than any other architect who developed and perfected the style  known as the California ranch house, which blossomed in the 1950s to become the  quintessential suburban home.  </P> <P> The style was distinguished by its single-story profile, accented by  low-pitched roofs and informal, free-flowing living spaces oriented through  sliding glass doors to the adjoining terraces and gardens.  </P> <P> In a career that spanned 57 years, May designed about 1,000 custom homes and  produced plans that were used in the development of an estimated 18,000 other  houses and numerous subdivisions across the United States and in other  countries. In addition, his plans and concepts have been freely adapted with  some license around the world.  </P> <P> Cliff, as everyone who knew him called him, was an unpretentious original who  never went to architecture school -- indeed he eschewed it -- and never  bothered to become a licensed architect until a year ago. The result was that  May never became a member of the American Institute of Architects, and  therefore was not eligible for a host of the professions's awards and  accompanying publicity.  </P> <P> A sixth generation Californian, Cliff was fiercely proud of a heritage that  included a great grandfather, Jose Maria Estudillo, who was the last mayor of  San Diego under Mexican rule. There also was in Cliff a streak of Yankee, which  he applied to the rendition of the courtyard ranchero he grew up in to fashion  the California ranch.  </P> <P> "I wanted the houses to be attractive and somehow express and serve the  California life style of informality and outdoor living -- that is my Southwest  heritage -- while, of course, also being penny-wise and affordable -- that is  my Yankee heritage," he once told me.  </P> <P> The result was a series of innovations, beginning in 1931 with his first houses  he designed and built. These included focusing the living room toward the back  yard and a patio rather to the front, and siting the garage as close to the  street as possible, freeing the rear for play space and entertainment.  </P> <P> "Houses should be designed primarily not the way they will look from the  street, but rather with their practical use in mind," Cliff said once while  reviewing a set of plans with me.  </P> <P> "Houses should be designed so people can live in them the way they want to, not  they way the architect wants them to," he added. "Everything else follows from  that."  </P> <P> What Cliff said he liked to think he was designing was each client's dream  house, and he was, be it a 1,000-square-foot construction for $10,000, as they  were in the 1930s, or 5,000 square feet and up for $500,000 and up in recent  years.  </P> <P> Indeed, popular magazines such as Sunset and the former House and Garden often  referred to a Cliff May design it featured as a California Dream House.  </P> <P> It was an appropriate label, for Cliff captured in his designs the spirit of  his time and place, in particular the buoyant late 1940s, the 1950s and early  1960s, when Southern California, with its benign weather, lush landscape and  youthful optimism, embodied the dream of a better life.  </P> <P> Cliff gave form to that dream with casual, comfortable, affordable houses that  embraced the landscape. He also designed some luxurious houses for a  well-heeled clientele, here and abroad.  </P> <P> In recent years, Cliff would note with sadness on how the dream of the better  life that lent Southern California its unique character was being eroded in a  smog-laden haze of insensitive, avaricious development.  </P> <P> "Don't they realize how special Los Angeles is?" he would say.  </P> <P> Yet to the end Cliff expressed the belief that if only architects and builders  would think more about the people they were serving instead of profits and  publicity the dream would persist.  </P> <P> "In the end it's the people that count, not the buildings," he said to me a few  months ago at a community gathering.  </P> <P> With the death of Cliff May, I fear, the California dream slips further from  our grasp.  </P> <P> In honor of his memory, friends and family suggest contributions be made to the  Los Angeles Conservancy to fund an annual Cliff May lecture series on the  region's architectural history.  </P></p>

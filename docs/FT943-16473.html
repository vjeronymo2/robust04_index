			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Rwandans fire on French French marine commandos came under fire from Rwanda Patriotic Front guerrillas for the first time yesterday as they evacuated nuns and orphans from the besieged university town of Butare. 'The RPF came over a hill and fired at the convoy leaving town,' Col Didier Thibaut of the 11th Parachute Regiment of Toulouse said. 'Some of the bullets lodged in our vehicles, and we returned fire. There were no casualties on our side.' Col Thibaut said this was the closest his soldiers had got to the front line in Rwanda's civil war, perhaps too close for comfort. The brief exchange of fire underscores the difficulty of the French mandate to protect civilians while not intervening in the Rwandan conflict. 'Our mission is not to fight the RPF, or to help the Rwandan government fight the RPF,' Col Thibaut said. The nuns and orphans, including Europeans, Hutus and Tutsis, were rescued in a lightning operation as the rebels closed in on Butare. The capture of the town, which is strategically located between the main roads south to Burundi and west to Zaire, would be a big victory for the Tutsi-led rebels. Col Thibaut confirmed last night that the town was expected to capitulate within hours. Yesterday afternoon, Butare's leafy boulevards were deserted, while thousands of civilians streamed out of the town. The route to Burundi was choked with overloaded vehicles and a mass of people on foot, fleeing with their mattresses, cooking pots and clothes.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Discussion between political correspondent Shlomo Raz at </F> the Foreign Ministry in Jerusalem and anchor Yisra'el Segal  following the Peres-Musa meeting--live]    [Text] [Segal] After his meeting with Egyptian Foreign  Minister 'Amr Musa, Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres said that a  basis has indeed been created for an agreement between Israel  and the PLO. Musa's meeting with top Foreign Ministry officials  ended a short while ago, and Shlomo Raz reports:    [Raz] I would even take a greater risk than Foreign Minister  Peres and state that, in fact, the problems between Israel and  the PLO are very near solution. Some work on preparing drafts  and formulations will be required, and Foreign Ministry legal  adviser Yo'el Singer and the PLO's Abu-al-Ala' [Ahmad Quray']  have begun working on this. At the same time, in Peres upcoming  meeting with Yasir 'Arafat next weekend, they will be able to  finalize the issues of the procedures at the border crossings  and the extent of the withdrawal from Jericho. That means that  the first stage of the negotiations on Gaza and Jericho will be  completed and, except for a few civilian issues, the  implementation of the agreement can begin.    Shim'on Peres, Yosi Beilin, Uri Savir, and others met with  Musa. After the meeting, which ended a few minutes ago, Peres  was asked whether the agreement is really close:    [Begin Peres recording] I hope so. I believe we have a good  opportunity to do this, but it has not happened yet. I would  rather be careful and not describe things that have not yet  happened as facts. At the same time, a basis was created which,  perhaps, allows for the attainment of such an agreement. I  believe 'Amr Musa gave us a picture of the way things are viewed  on the Egyptian side, which is not much different from the  Israeli view. [end recording]    [Raz] When Peres says that things look alike on both the  Israeli and the Egyptian sides, he is referring to the fact that  Egyptian President Husni Mubarak met with PLO leader Yasir  'Arafat yesterday. Hence, we can deduce what Musa is basing his  optimism on, beyond what he is willing to share with us here.    Earlier today, Musa met with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin.  After that meeting, Musa said he brought a message from  President Mubarak to Rabin. This discussion covered the whole  range of negotiations with the Arabs but focused mainly on the  Israel-PLO talks or, to be more specific, on the issue of the  talks on Gaza and Jericho First, which will resume next week in  Davos, Switzerland; the Taba talks, which are taking place at  this time; the economic talks, which are to resume in Paris;  and, naturally, the Washington talks. Musa spoke about the  current set of talks:    [Begin Musa recording, in English] There are a set of talks.  I hope, I even trust, that they will push forward the  Israeli-Palestinian process. I must say that I am not  pessimistic. [end recording]    [Raz] Musa says he is not pessimistic regarding this set of  talks; however, speaking in closed forums, he said that he is  very optimistic. The Egyptian foreign minister is currently  having lunch, after which he will depart for Cairo after holding  what has become routine meetings between Israeli and Egyptian  officials, which stem from the willingness of all the parties to  demonstrate that Egypt is playing a special role in the regional  processes.    [Segal] Could we perhaps add today's remarks to what Prime  Minister Yitzhaq Rabin said yesterday about Israel's security  stands beginning to yield fruit? Does this mean that they will  be accepted?    [Raz] I believe we can say that. In general, the solution  of the problem of the bridges and border crossings will be such  that the control will, in fact, remain in Israel's hands, but a  technical solution is being sought so that Israel's presence at  the bridges will not be visible.    [Segal] Electronic means will be used.    [Raz] Electronic and other, perhaps less sophisticated,  means that are not visible to the naked eye will be used. A  senior Israeli political source called it the invisible man's  technique: It sees but is not seen. The parties, therefore, met  each other half way. Israel gave in on maintaining a physical  presence but not on actual control.    The differences over the Jericho issue have not been bridged  yet, but it would seem that the Palestinians are inclined to  understand that Israel will not give them corridors to al-Nabi  Musa or the Muratas baptism site. They will be allowed to  construct a resort on Palestinian-owned lands on the northern  shores of the Dead Sea.</p>

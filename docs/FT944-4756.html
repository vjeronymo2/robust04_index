			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / Bank unions urge Sunday work ban Banking unions yesterday urged their members not to volunteer for Sunday working, as National Westminster Bank confirmed that 23 of its 2,500 branches would be open for business on the two Sundays before Christmas. The NatWest Staff Association, which has about 40,000 members, and the banking union Bifu, which has about 16,000 members in NatWest, urged staff not to volunteer. If they did not volunteer the bank's management would have to negotiate terms for Sunday working. NatWest is the first of the four biggest UK high street banks to make this move. The others said yesterday that they had no plans to follow suit. The bank said branches would be open between 10.30am and 3.30pm in areas including shopping centres and high streets, where area managers believed there was a commercial justification for opening and staff were prepared to work Sundays. Saturday banking has proved popular with customers seeking investment or mortgage advice rather than simply access to their accounts, which can be provided through cash machines. But the NatWest Staff Association and some of NatWest's competitors doubted that there was a business case for Sunday opening that could be established in the pre-Christmas rush. Mr Dai Davies, general secretary of the staff association, said: 'I can't believe anybody would go into NatWest on a Sunday before Christmas in search of a mortgage.' Bank customers using the branches will be asked their views about Sunday opening. A strong positive response would increase the prospect of regular Sunday opening next year and would put more pressure on other high street banks to do the same.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Tajik Labor Minister Shukurjon Zuhurov and </F> opposition official Ata Khan Latifi by unidentified  correspondent; including passage by Ramero Perez Ballon, UN  special envoy to the Tajik peace talks, in English followed by  further announcer-read remarks by Balloon; in Tehran, date not  given -- recorded]    [Text] Direct talks between Tajik Government  representatives and opposition groups continued in Tehran today.  Our reporter has separately interviewed Tajik representatives  as well as opposition members and UN representative.    [Correspondent] How hopeful are you about the outcome of  these talks?    [Zuhurov] I think the talks are not going to be very easy;  however, I hope that while in Tehran we will witness a round of  fruitful talks between the Tajiks that will lead to a resolution.    [Correspondent] What role can Iran play?    [Zuhurov] I think Iran can play a major role. Today, during  the opening session of the talks, I had the feeling that all the  Iranian people, the Iranian Government, and the Iranian Foreign  Ministry--as represented by Foreign Minister Velayati--are all  extremely eager and interested in restoring peace and  tranquility in Tajikistan as soon as possible.    [Correspondent] God willing. Thank you very much. Let us  ask a question to Ata Khan Latifi. Mr. Latifi, as the  representative of the Tajik opposition groups, how hopeful are  you about these talks and what issues are you going to raise  during these round of the talks?    [Latifi] We shall do our best during these talks to reach a  conclusion. We took the first step in Moscow. We signed  several agreements and now we are obliged to take some serious  steps during these talks. I wish to emphasize that the  cease-fire should be discussed during the talks. This is one of  our conditions which we raised in Moscow. We have expanded this  condition and we will raise it again tomorrow.    [Correspondent] Elections are going to be held in Tajikistan  soon. What is the opinion of the opposition groups on these  elections?    [Latifi] You think about it, how can they hold elections at  a  time when a large number of Tajik people are outside their  country? They have fled the country to live as refugees in  dozens of countries. They are destitute and helpless. Their  children have been deprived of schools for the second  consecutive year. There are a number of refugees in Tajikistan  itself who keep moving from one city to the next and from one  village to another. How can elections be organized under such  circumstances?    [Correspondent] As a representative of the opposition, what  are your expectations from the Tajik Government during these  talks?    [Latifi] I believe at the present we should all feel sorry  for the people. If we all act with the intention of serving the  future of our republic, we shall reach a conclusion.    [Ballon] My plan is to succeed, but it is up to the Tajik  sides to decide a way.    [Announcer] UN envoy at the Tajik peace talks, Mr. Ballon,  stressed that the warring factions in Tajikistan have now  realized that the only way of resolving the Tajik crisis is  through talks. He added: Despite the existing difficulties in  the talks, I am optimistic about the outcome of these talks in  Tehran. He praised the role played by the Islamic Republic of  Iran, Russia, and Tajikistan's other neighbors in the peace  talks.</p>

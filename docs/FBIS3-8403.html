"As a matter of fact the PUNR  has to be credited with the change," Ioan Gavra mentioned,  "because it is us that have awakened the ruling party to  reality, through this reshuffle and through the implementation  of the political program. This is the political performance  number one, especially that a part of the executive's program  belongs to us."    Octavian Cozminca, secretary of state, explains in daily  ADEVARUL that the government reshuffle was necessary, because  there was lack of concordance in the process of reform in some  ministries. "I can assure you that the four ministers are  competent politicians or technocrats."    Corneliu Coposu, president of the Christian Democratic  National Peasant Party, told the national radio: "I think this  reshuffle has had a negative impact on public opinion, i.e. it  is an inconsequential face-lift meant to extend the government's  agony. The government has not been consolidated with this  reshuffle, it has gained nothing in point of prestige or  stability and especially as regards external credibility."    Dinu Patriciu, the Liberal Party [PL '93] 1993: "Instead of  a parliamentary majority that should back a genuinely  reform-oriented government, the minimal solution was chosen of  changing some ministers, again in disregard of the Constitution,  i.e. without having them heard in the parliament. This proves  that the attitude of the PL '93 was justified and we hope our  partners in the opposition too, have understood that the talks  with the PDSR [Social Democracy Party of Romania] are not  serious, as they are meant only to mark time, with no serious  end."    Sergiu Cunescu -- the Romanian Social-Democratic Party: "I  appreciate the power has understood the necessity of appointing  civilians at the head of the Ministries of the Interior and  Defence. But we deplore the replacement at the head of the Army  of General Spiroiu whom we highly regard."    Daily ADEVARUL prints General Niculae Spiroiu's statement  that the decision to change him belongs to the PDSR. "I can  tell you the Army is under political control."    Like President Ion Iliescu announced, General Spiroiu will  represent Romania at the NATO Headquarters in Brussels, while  Lieutenant-General George Ioan Danescu will remain with the  Ministry of the Interior, as the new minister's deputy, thus  helping with his experience in the modernization of the Ministry.    As regards Petre Ninosu and Paul Teodoru, they too, will  assist for a while in the reorganization of the ministries they  headed -- justice and transport -- and will then be given other  assignments.</p>

			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / Mitterrand prolongs uncertainty on Cresson PRESIDENT Mitterrand yesterday appeared to be having second thoughts over the dismissal of Mrs Edith Cresson as French prime minister. Her removal had previously been regarded as virtually inevitable after the disastrous setback suffered by the government in the recent round of local elections. Le Monde yesterday openly aired the possibility that President Mitterrand might be in the process of changing his mind over whether to replace Mrs Cresson. But, Mr Jean Auroux, parliamentary leader of the Socialist Party, predicted that a new government of some kind would be formed within the next 24 hours. For the third day running, the President conducted intensive consultations with friends and associates on the lessons to be drawn from the regional and departmental elections, in which the Socialists suffered humiliating defeats. Mrs Cresson was again summoned to the Elysee Palace for talks, but when she returned to her office at the Hotel Matignon, it appeared nothing had been settled. A broadcaster who accompanied her on Tuesday to the Hanover trade fair said Mrs Cresson had privately vented her bitterness against the party, accusing the Socialist leader, Mr Laurent Fabius, and the finance minister, Mr Pierre Beregovoy, of having sabotaged her premiership. If President Mitterrand were to ask Mrs Cresson to stay on, she is believed to have told him that she would want a far-reaching cabinet reshuffle that would include the removal of many of the barons of the Socialist Party, known colloquially as 'les elephants'. The depth of the crisis precipitated by the regional election results also appears to have brought to the surface antagonisms between leading members of the Socialist Party, as well as differences over the right policy choices to respond to the popular vote. President Mitterrand's delay in making up his mind does not prove that he has decided to keep Mrs Cresson, nor that he has decided against any of the other candidates. But he is evidently determined to take all the time he needs before making up his mind on such a critical choice at such a critical time, since this is probably the last change of government he can make before next year's general elections. Officials at the Elysee Palace said that Mr Mitterrand was mainly preoccupied in thinking about how the government should best change its policies in response to the swingeing disavowal of the electorate. They suggested that the President's strategic decisions in adopting new policies were more important than the choice of a prime minister. Long delays in the lead-up to an important decision have been frequent in Mr Mitterrand's career. In 1983, he hesitated for nine days over whether to dismiss Mr Pierre Mauroy, before finally asking him to stay on. Yesterday, there were conflicting signals from the camps of the contending candidates for prime minister. Some of Mrs Cresson's staff indicated that she might, after all, stay in office, with one official saying: 'We shall not leave until the crocuses are completely out. The work goes on.' However, Mr Beregovoy, widely tipped as the favourite to succeed Mrs Cresson, was reported to be busily engaged in taking soundings with possible members of a new cabinet. However, political sources said some senior party barons had launched a counter-offensive in favour of the European Commission president, Mr Jacques Delors - despite the fact that Mr Delors has appeared to rule himself out of the race. They argue that Mr Beregovoy would not be able to rally support behind the Socialists, who fell to a mere 18.3 per cent in the regional elections. See World Stockmarkets</p>

			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / US Election (World Reaction): Uruguay Round set to simmer on back-burner FEARS in Europe and Japan that Mr Clinton will take a tougher stance on trade issues - with the possibility of edging the US towards protectionism - were quickly voiced yesterday. The fact is, however, that he remains an unknown quantity. Mr Clinton has been deliberately, and perhaps cleverly, coy on trade issues. All he was willing to say during one of the presidential debates was: 'I'll have a free and fair trade policy, a hard-headed realistic policy, and not get caught up in rubber-stamping everything the Bush administration did.' He has said in general terms that he supports the Uruguay Round, and has described the free trade pact with Mexico as desirable, but only if accompanied by a national economic strategy. 'When you get past agriculture, Clinton's people really will have to make choices among competing political interests, and it would be awkward, if not bizarre, for the outgoing administration to make decisions with which the incoming president may disagree,' said Mr Harry Freeman. Mr Freeman is executive director of the MTN Coalition, a non-partisan business grouping organised to get a Uruguay Round package passed by Congress. 'It would have been difficult for Clinton to redo things that have already been agreed - but that difficulty ended on Tuesday night,' he said. The first consequence of a Clinton victory, therefore, is the collapse of present efforts to agree a Uruguay Round package. Having sidelined trade issues during the campaign, there is no reason to believe Mr Clinton will promote them to the top of his political agenda on January 21. A long delay can be expected before serious negotiations on the Round can resume. He is likely to be successful in negotiating Congressional renewal of 'fast track' legislation which effectively expires next March, and which is essential for smooth ratification of any Uruguay Round deal. But a Clinton administration is likely to have priorities that do not match those of the present US Trade Representative's Office. This implies a need to unravel the draft Uruguay Round agreement that has taken six years to bring to the table - with uncertain reactions by the other 104 contracting parties to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt). The most controversial new priorities are likely to involve 'non-traditional areas' like workers' rights, human rights and environmental concerns. How tough he will be in forcing these issues on to the trade agenda is unclear. Trading partners wonder whether Mr Clinton will be as zealous as his predecessor in blocking the more protectionist excesses of Congress. Mr Michio Watanabe, Japan's foreign minister, noted: 'The Democratic party has been supporting trade protectionism and attempting to put a brake on the sale of cheaper Japanese goods. It's possible (that a President Clinton) would reactivate (Super) 301.' Super 301, a potent modification of Section 301 of the US's 1984 Trade Act, would permit Washington to impose tariffs of up to 100 per cent on exports of a country that refused to open its markets to US goods. A trade bill passed by the House of Representatives in July and now before the Senate would renew for five years the Super 301 clause, which expired two years ago. While President Bush had been poised to veto the bill, no one has yet determined Mr Clinton's reaction. The tendency to prefer bilateral settlement of trade disputes implied in Super 301 is at odds with Gatt principals that disputes should be settled multilaterally, and is feared by many US trading partners. Japan has been targeted in part because of its mounting trade surpluses with the US. But it is not alone. Other countries in trade surplus with the US, like Taiwan and China, may fear similar treatment. Indeed, unless Beijing hastily secures the safe haven of Gatt membership - as it is trying to do by next March - it will be in grave danger of losing its most favoured nation trading status with the US, which has remained in place over the past four years thanks only to Mr Bush's success in fiercely-fought veto battles with Congress. Mr Clinton has also hinted that he would take a tougher view on 'anti-dumping' action against 'unfair' traders. Such actions - already widely abused by the US and the EC in defence of uncompetitive but powerful domestic industrial interests - were due for reform under the Uruguay Round. The hint of their wider use is seen by the US's trading partners as a dangerous pointer in the direction of protectionism. Clinton supporters nevertheless insist that 'while it is right to be cautious, it would be wrong at this stage to make judgments'. Said on Washington-based trade lobbyist: 'If I were you, I would give Clinton a chance - you might be surprised. You will have to hold your breath a while.'</p>

			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Curious similarity leads GrandMet to Dollars 500m suit WHAT'S THE difference between a 'Curious Kid' and a 'Burger King Kid'? Far more than a hamburger may rest on the answer. Grand Metropolitan, the food and drink group which owns the US-based Burger King chain, has become the target of a US lawsuit which claims that the cartoon characters used to promote the Burger King Kids Club were copied from an earlier cartoon called 'The Curious Kids'. The plaintiff is CK Company, a general partnership linked to a small New York-based company called Gould &amp; Reichman and which holds the copyright to the Curious Kids characters. The damages claimed are anything but modest. CK is asking for Dollars 500m (Pounds 286m). The nub of the CK case is that the Burger King Kids have mimicked many of the Curious Kids features. One character in both strips is in a wheelchair; one is an Afro-American boy; there are three Caucasian boys in each, and two Caucasian girls. The Curious Kids have a dog called Morty, the Burger King Kids one called Woofer. Both 'gangs' play musical instruments, and have one boy and one girl vocalist - Kid Vid and Boomer in the case of Burger King, or David and Tracey for the Curious Kids. CK brought similar allegations to Burger King's attention in July 1991, when they were investigated. GrandMet has not seen the suit, but believes it is without merit. The lawsuit says the Curious Kids were devised 'to teach elementary science concepts and reading skills and focus on social issues.' The Burger King Kids Club is used as a marketing tool.</p>

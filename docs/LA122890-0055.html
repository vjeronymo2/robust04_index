			<p><P> December 28, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: VENTURA;  </P> <P> PARKS DEPARTMENT RECEIVES $514,000  </P> <P> More than $500,000 in community contributions, an increase of 39% over the  previous year, has been received by the Ventura Department of Parks and  Recreation for the 1989-90 fiscal year, according to a recently released annual  report.  </P> <P> The $514,000 figure is based on volunteer hours at minimum wage, various cash  donations and other contributions from businesses and community organizations.  </P> <P> "Many of our programs and services would not be possible without the dedicated  support of approximately 600 volunteers who help by serving hot meals to  seniors, giving tours of historical sites, assisting with special events and  beautifying our parks," said Barbara Harison, department director.  </P> <P> Over the last several years, the Ventura Avenue Lions Club has contributed  nearly $50,000 to the Harry A. Lyon Youth Scholarship Fund, which has enabled  190 needy youths to participate in a variety of recreation classes, camps and  sports programs, according to the report.  </P> <P> "We've received total support from the community," said Debbie Solomon, a  department spokeswoman.  </P> <P> "We're very proud of that. We feel a lot of it has to do with how much people  value their community. . . . Volunteerism is very much alive and well. We've  seen a total resurgence of it."  </P> <P> The department provides programs and services to about 1.5 million residents  and visitors a year.  </P> <P> It oversees the operation and management of 22 community parks, two golf  courses, two senior centers, two community centers, the Olivas Adobe and Ortega  Adobe historical sites and the Albinger Archaeological Museum.

			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / As They Say in Europe: Morality on a tight leash A British journalist rarely questions his or her moral framework. The chap who sits at a table in a smart restaurant listening to a tart extracting confessions of lust and infidelity from a leading public servant does not spend much time pondering ethics. In France things are different. A new three-part book - the title translates as 'The Journalists - Stars, Scribes and Scribblers,' * - delves deep into questions of journalistic morality. The first part is called 'Diary of a Dog'. That is taken from the eulogy delivered by President Mitterrand at the funeral of his one-time prime minister, Pierre Beregovoy, who shot himself a year ago. Mitterrand spoke of the 'dogs' who had driven Beregovoy to his death. He meant the journalists who had investigated his interest-free loan from a leading businessman. The writer is Jean-Francois Lacan who was once media and communications editor at Le Monde. He has followed a professional code of such rigour that it has led him from one disaster to another and vilification from intellectuals and fellow hacks. He left Le Monde in characteristic circumstances, after his investigation into the share scandal associated with the Pechiney aluminium company, in which Lacan had implicated Patrice Pelat. Pelat died soon after of a heart attack and Lacan was pilloried. Le Monde apparently thought he had behaved badly - partly because he had smuggled his report into the paper when his editor had not been around. The fact that Lacan was entirely right hardly mattered. He then founded a daily called La Truffe. This consisted of short news items exposing evil. It folded after two months, so Lacan went into television where he worked on a programme called Bas les masques which specialised in risque exposes. It perished after an attack on what the French call 'Reality shows' by an academic. It had a memorable opening: 'It is time for a political reflection on this televisual style, instead of contenting oneself with routine sermons on the sly tricks of the producers, the obscenity of the broadcasts and the imbecility of the public.' Lacan supports British ways. He tells of a conversation with a minister who was contemplating tightening up already strict laws on privacy. The minister himself had been under attack by the satirical weekly, Le Canard enchaine. He told Lacan: 'I count on you to explain that I am not an enemy of the press, but this time Le Canard has overstepped the mark.' Some weeks later Lacan witnessed a debate between the minister and the then chairman of the British Press Council, Lord MacGregor. 'Sure of finding an ally in the person of the noble Lord, the minister pressed him to exhort French journalists to respect privacy.' 'I can't help you,' said MacGregor. Smiling, he noted it was always liberals who wanted to muzzle the press in the name of privacy. 'The difficulty, you see, is that each press investigation into a public figure, his misdeeds, his corruption, more or less obliges the journalist to stick his nose into his private life.' It may seem that French journalists are a stiff-necked lot who refuse to dive into everyday merde. But for Lacan they are moral pygmies. He worries about an ancient income tax benefit - a 30 per cent allowance for so-called representational expenses - but other concerns are more important. 'Every newsroom throws up stories of motoring correspondents who have never paid for a car, the financial reporters who benefit from insiders' networks on the bourse, the political reporter who is compensated by the minister's kind gift of a necklace for his wife. Spend a few days before Christmas in editors' offices and see the accumulation of cases of fine wines, televisions, watches or other business gifts from grateful advertisers.' An account of a lunch with a corporate PR boss, 'Sylvie', was fascinating. She explained how she had stitched up most of the press prior to the announcement of some poor results. An article planted here, an interview there and a strategic lunch would ensure there would be no 'disobliging commentaries' once the results appeared. All this seems somewhat overdrawn but Lacan's world is unusually dramatic. This may be because the reputation of French journalists is no better than that of the British among their public. But in France it may be for the wrong reasons. * Published by Syros, Paris, 277pp, FFr145 James Morgan is economics correspondent of the BBC World Service.</p>

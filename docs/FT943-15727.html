			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / FT Exporter (5): Focus of trade constraints shifts - While the demise of Comecon has led to an easing of controls, Alan Spence finds that they have not disappeared altogether / High tech exports The sale of high technology equipment to sensitive destinations has become easier since the collapse of communism, but strict controls remain. The Paris-based organisation Co-com - the co-ordinating committee on multilateral export controls - went into voluntary retirement on March 30 this year after 47 years of curbing western military and high technology exports to communist countries. Members, comprising all the NATO allies except for Iceland, and including Australia and Japan, will retain the current slate of banned items, although enforcement will rely on national discretion. The political and economic liberalisation within former Comecon countries has reduced the western governments' need to control the sale to the region of 'dual-use' technology - goods capable of, but not specially designed for, military purposes. But the collapse of communism in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union does not mean that all restraints have disappeared. The focus of residual controls has shifted to developing countries, especially, for example, North Korea and Iran. Reductions in trade constraints are reflected in the diminishing volumes of export licences issued by the UK's Export Control Organisation (ECO), a unit within the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI). About 21,000 licences were approved by ECO in 1993, compared to about 100,000 in 1988. And the ECO estimates provisioning of about 18,000-19,000 licences for 1994. Cocom's final year was marked by the easing of restrictions, especially for exporters of telecommunications equipment, computers and precision machine tools. UK computer manufacturer ICL reports Pounds 60m worth of business in eastern Europe for 1993, a figure 'substantially up from the previous year', says a company spokesperson. Cocom began to reduce a long list of proscribed items in 1990, while also removing fast-reforming countries such as Hungary, Poland and Czechoslovakia from sensitive destination categories. On the day of Cocom's demise, the US Commerce Department removed licensing requirements on almost all low level telecommunications equipment and computers to every ex-communist nation except North Korea. Constraints on UK exporters were further relaxed in May with an amendment to the 1992 Export of Goods (Control) Order (EGCO). 'I expect a one-third reduction in the number of licence applications for industrial goods alone,' said Richard Needham, Britain's trade minister in response to the amendment. ECO annual licensing for industrial 'dual-use' exports has fallen from about 60,000 in the late 1980s to below 10,000 at present. Exports of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) and associated components are still covered by three principal non-proliferation controls: the 1968 Nuclear non-Proliferation Treaty; the 1987 Missile Technology Control Regime; and the Australia Group, which deals with chemical and biological warfare weaponry and components. Under UK legislation passed in 1939 and amended in 1990, the legal onus lies with the exporter to apply for a licence, when selling military equipment and sophisticated dual-use technology overseas. Few cases are refused in practice. Last year 300 applications were turned down. Successful UK applications for military export licences average 12,000 per year, although the May amendments to EGCO have increased restraints upon sales of armoured vehicles, military components. digital controllers and testing equipment. The growth area in control is developing countries where 41 destinations are now subject to special licensing procedures. Sanctions agreed by the UN Security Council include arms embargoes to Somalia and Liberia, and complete embargoes upon trade with Iraq, Haiti and Serbia-Montenegro. Certain goods are additionally prohibited from Libya and Angola. UK compliance procedures were upgraded in 1990 after difficulties with Libyan exports. An 'end-use', or 'catch-all' control was introduced, forcing would-be exporters to make reasonable enquiries to allay any suspicions regarding use or destination. This has been consolidated through the launch in March of the Export Training Initiative - a package of materials for companies to promote organisational awareness - and the publication of a Code of Practice for Enforcement. More than 200 annual compliance visits are made by ECO to UK companies to reinforce the licensing process. These are mainly to companies with Open Individual Export Licences which cover individual exporters for regular shipments over two and three years to specified destinations.

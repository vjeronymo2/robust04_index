			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> d. The applicable ``First-Class Mail Enclosed'' or ``Third-Class Mail Enclosed''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> marking must be placed on or in the host publication if it contains a nonincidental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> First- or third-class enclosure. If placed on the outer wrapper, polybag, envelope,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or cover of the host publication, the marking must be set in type no smaller than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any used in the required ``POSTMASTER: Send change of address .&blank;.&blank;.'' statement. If  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> placed in the identification statement, the marking must meet the applicable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards. The marking must not be on or in copies not accompanied by a First- or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> third-class enclosure unless additional information is provided under the applicable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> postage payment standards in P070.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 1.4&blank;Enclosures at Second-Class Rates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Only the following material may be included loose as an enclosure in a second-class mailpiece and be paid at second-class rates, subject to the corresponding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditions:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. An incidental First-Class piece that must be closely related but secondary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the second-class publication with which it is enclosed, and that consists of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> matter that, if mailed separately, would require First-Class postage. Examples of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an incidental First-Class enclosure are a bill for the publication, a statement of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> account for past publication purchases, or a personal message or greeting included  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the publication.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. A receipt, request, or order for a subscription that may be printed or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> written; prepared as a card or envelope, including business reply, or as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> combination form for the host and one or more second-class publications issued by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the same publisher; arranged to include a coin receptacle; and inserted in an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> envelope within the publication. The receipt or request may be part of or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accompanied by a single sheet of printed matter containing information related exclusively to a receipt or request or order for a subscription to the host second-class  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> publication (or a combination of the host and other second-class publications of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> same publisher), if that printed matter does not advertise, promote, or offer for sale  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other products or services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. A card or form for the recipient's use in providing address correction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information to the publisher that may be printed or written; prepared as a card or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> envelope, including business reply, or as a combination form for two or more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> second-class publications issued by the same publisher; inserted in an envelope  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that is attached to, bound in, or loose within the publication; or prepared as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> detachable part of another permissible enclosure. Enclosures listed in 1.4b and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.4c are not counted when determining the percentage of advertising in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> publication, but they are included in the total weight of the publication reported on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the mailing statement. If the publication otherwise consists entirely of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonadvertising matter, an incidental First-Class enclosure as described in 1.4a may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be treated as nonadvertising matter. In all other cases, an incidental First-Class  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enclosure is considered part of the advertising portion of the publication.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 1.5&blank;Supplements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A supplement is one or more pages (subject to 1.1) formed by one or more printed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sheets that are not bound into a publication. A bound publication with one or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more supplements must be enclosed in a wrapper (see 3.3 and 3.4). If a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supplement to a bound publication is formed of more than one sheet, all sheets  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comprising the supplement must be bound together. Except where the mailpiece is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enclosed in a wrapper (see 3.4), a supplement to an unbound publication must be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> combined with, and inserted within, the publication. A loose supplement may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> included with an unbound publication only if the mailpiece is enclosed in a wrapper  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (see 3.4). A supplement may be devoted to a single topic, and may contain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> material different from that in the host publication. The external dimensions of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supplement (i.e., its length and height) may not exceed those of the host  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> publication. Each supplement to a bound publication and loose supplements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> included with unbound publications must bear the printed endorsement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Supplement to'' followed by the name of the publication or publisher.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 1.6&blank;Covers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A cover may be placed on the outside of a second-class publication. A protective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cover is an additional cover placed around the outside of a publication; preparation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is subject to 3.5. Advertising, nonadvertising, or both may be printed on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cover or protective cover. The cover and protective cover on a publication are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> included when measuring advertising percentage. Nothing may be attached to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cover or protective cover except as permitted under 1.8.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

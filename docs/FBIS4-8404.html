			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Bosnia is experiencing renewed tension with the  advance of Serbs on Gorazde, which has been shelled for several  days. [passage omitted]    General de Lapresle, the commander of the UN forces in the  former Yugoslavia, justifies the air strikes by the difficult  situation faced by the Blue Helmets in the region. General de  Lapresle was interviewed by Remy Hourdan:    [Begin Lapresle recording] The first point, which seems  essential to me, is not to give undue importance to the close  air support actions. These were simply aimed at enabling the  United Nations to protect its personnel based in the town of  Gorazde. This was a very precise case fully anticipated by UN  guidelines perfectly known to all parties on the ground. When  UN soldiers or personnel are placed in a situation of  self-defense we use all means at our disposal. If UN personnel  had not been threatened in Gorazde we would not have used the  close air support action as we did; we would have used another  UN procedure to take into account the fact that Gorazde was  designated a safe area and we could have called on NATO planes  through the channels provided by the UN resolution.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To entertain public comment on the implementation plan for Columbia Falls, the State of Montana held a public hearing on November 15, 1991, for the Flathead County Air Pollution Control Program. A second hearing was held on January 24, 1992, to address the Plum Creek Manufacturing, Inc. permit and the Columbia Falls PM&hyph;10 SIP. The State supplied evidence that adequate public notice for these hearings was provided. Following the public hearings, the local air pollution control plan and the Columbia Falls PM&hyph;10 SIP were adopted by the State. The submittal for the Flathead County Air Pollution Control Program was signed by the Governor on November 25, 1991. The submittal for the final Columbia Falls PM&hyph;10 SIP was signed by the Governor on May 6, 1992. The final plan was received by EPA on May 12, 1992 as a proposed revision to the SIP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The SIP revisions were reviewed by EPA to determine completeness in accordance with the completeness criteria set out at 40 CFR part 51, appendix V (1992). The submittal was found to be complete and a letter, dated August 7, 1992, was forwarded to the Governor indicating the completeness of the submittal and the next steps to be taken in the review process. In today's action EPA proposes to approve the Montana PM&hyph;10 SIP submittals for Columbia Falls, as dated November 25, 1991 (with the exception of the Kalispell specific rules) and May 6, 1992, with technical revisions dated June 15, 1993, and invites public comment on the action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Accurate Emission Inventory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 172(c)(3) of the Act requires that nonattainment plan provisions include a comprehensive, accurate, current inventory of actual emissions from all sources of relevant pollutants in the nonattainment area. The emission inventory also should include a comprehensive, accurate, and current inventory of allowable emissions in the area. Because the submission of such inventories is a necessary adjunct to an area's attainment demonstration (or demonstration that the area cannot practicably attain), the emission inventories must be received with the submission (see 57 FR 13539).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Columbia Falls' base year emission inventory was developed for July 1, 1989, through June 30, 1990. The results were segregated into seasonal winter and spring emissions. On an annual basis, industrial facilities account for 56.5% of the PM&hyph;10 emissions, with industrial processes and fugitive industrial road dust responsible for 78.8 and 21.2% of this percentage, respectively. Area sources account for 43% of the total annual PM&hyph;10 emissions, with re-entrained road dust responsible for 89% of all area source contributions. Residential wood burning area sources accounted for 4.3% of total annual PM&hyph;10 emissions in Columbia Falls. The emission inventory shows that the emissions are seasonal, with re-entrained road dust the primary source in the summer and industrial sources the largest contributor during the fall, winter, and spring.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is proposing to approve the emission inventory because it is accurate and comprehensive, and provides a sufficient basis for determining the adequacy of the attainment demonstration for this area consistent with the requirements of sections 172(c)(3) and 110(a)(2)(K) of the Act. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  For further details see the TSD for this proposed action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> EPA issued guidance on PM&hyph;10 emissions inventories prior to the enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments in the form of the 1987  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> PM&hyph;10 SIP Development Guideline. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  The guidance provided in this document appears to be consistent with the revised Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 3. RACM (Including RACT)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As noted, the initial moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas must submit provisions to assure that RACM (including RACT) are implemented no later than December 10, 1993 (see sections 172(c)(1) and 189(a)(1)(C)). The General Preamble contains a detailed discussion of EPA's interpretation of the RACM (including RACT) requirement (see 57 FR 13539&hyph;13545 and 13560&hyph;13561).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / ATTORNEY GENERAL;  </P> <P> SMITH LACKS KNOCKOUT ISSUE IN BATTLE WITH LUNGREN  </P> <P> Whoever coined the phrase "lightning never strikes twice" apparently never met  Democratic state attorney general candidate Arlo Smith.  </P> <P> Eleven years ago, Smith, a little-known administrator in the attorney general's  office, was elected district attorney of San Francisco after a rough-and-tumble  campaign in which he relentlessly attacked a well-known incumbent over the  botched prosecution of mayoral assassin Dan White.  </P> <P> Last spring, Smith rode the reverberations of the unsuccessful McMartin child  molestation case to victory in the Democratic attorney general primary, coming  out of obscurity to defeat nationally known Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Ira  Reiner.  </P> <P> This fall, Smith will have to make it on his own. No longer an underdog and  without an overwhelming media-grabbing issue, Smith, 62, is facing an  aggressive Republican general election foe, former Rep. Dan Lungren.  </P> <P> "Smith knows how to run one type of campaign and it's been successful for him  twice," said San Francisco political consultant Sam Singer, who managed  Reiner's campaign. "But now he's running against a candidate that doesn't fit  that profile."  </P> <P> Smith is seeking to meet the challenge by hammering away at his conservative  opponent's congressional voting record. Lungren, he points out, has  consistently sought to curb abortion rights and voted against most  environmental protection funding bills during his five-term tenure that ended  in 1988.  </P> <P> "This race is different than other campaigns Arlo has been in," conceded Marc  Dann, Smith's campaign manager. "But it's the kind of campaign that's the  candidate's dream. You always say you want to run on the issues. The beauty of  this race is that we literally win on the issues."  </P> <P> A mediocre public speaker but a tireless campaigner, Smith is frenetically  racing across the state, holding frequent press conferences from Sacramento to  San Diego in which he employs a dizzying array of gimmicks to draw optimum TV  news coverage. To highlight Lungren's lack of prosecutorial experience, he  recently met reporters in the office of a legal placement firm, stamping a  poster-sized Lungren resume "Rejected." That effort almost backfired when Smith  nearly stamped his own resume by mistake before campaign staffers frantically  yelled a warning.  </P> <P> The San Francisco prosecutor is receiving help from labor, ethnic,  environmental and women's groups that opposed Lungren's unsuccessful nomination  to the post of state treasurer in 1988. Last week, Smith was endorsed by the  state's leading environmental protection organizations, whose leaders termed  Lungren an anti-environmental extremist. Smith also was strongly endorsed by  once-bitter foe Reiner. "Arlo Smith will argue that (restrictions on abortion  rights) are constitutionally impermissible and Dan Lungren will not," Reiner  said at a $500-a-plate campaign dinner. With the November vote nearing and the  two candidates neck and neck in the polls, the jury is out on the effectiveness  of Smith's efforts.  </P> <P> For one thing, it remains to be seen whether social issues are of prime concern  to voters for a job widely viewed as the state's top law enforcement post.  </P> <P> "People expect the attorney general to fight crime," said Sal Russo, a  Republican campaign consultant based in Sacramento. "Intellectually, they know  (the attorney general) does a lot of things. But in their gut they want a crime  fighter."  </P> <P> Lungren, insisting that drugs and violence are the key issues, has stressed a  hard-line, anti-crime image, highlighting the key role he played in passage of  tough federal crime-fighting legislation during the Reagan Administration.  </P> <P> Smith has countered by comparing resumes. Emphasizing that Lungren has never  prosecuted a criminal case, Smith has pointed to his 36 years as a district  attorney and deputy attorney general, including a stint as chief of its  criminal division.  </P> <P> There also is the question of whether the public is paying attention to the  upcoming vote.  </P> <P> A recent Los Angeles Times poll showed that only half the voters had made up  their minds on Lungren or Smith. Another poll indicated that fewer than 4 in 10  registered voters across the state could identify the two candidates.  </P> <P> Without the hot news value of a McMartin trial that dominated the primary  campaign, newspapers and TV news broadcasts have been providing limited  coverage. Smith, who squared off against Lungren in several moderator-free  debates before the June Democratic primary, has refused to participate in  similar encounters this fall.  </P> <P> Lungren claims that Smith, who has agreed only to three joint appearances on  30-minute TV news conference broadcasts, is afraid to debate in an uncontrolled  format.  </P> <P> Smith's toughest problem, perhaps, is that for the first time in his political  career, he faces an opponent who is not underestimating his chances.  </P> <P> In 1979, Smith shocked overconfident San Francisco prosecutor Joe Freitas by  attacking his prosecution of White, who received less than eight years in  prison for killing Mayor George Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk. Smith faced  no opposition in his two subsequent local reelection bids.  </P> <P> In the Democratic primary for attorney general, Reiner generally ignored Smith  in the hope of depriving him of a statewide forum.  </P> <P> Reiner's strategy short-circuited because of the deluge of negative publicity  he received in connection with the McMartin trial. While the Los Angeles  prosecutor made few public appearances, the peripatetic Smith hustled around  the state, portraying himself as an alternative.  </P> <P> "Arlo has always done his best when he had some particular case or situation  when he can show a major flaw in his opponent," said Joe Shumate, a Republican  campaign consultant based in San Francisco. "Arlo is a 100% tough campaigner  and you just can't take him lightly."  </P> <P> Lungren has not. Seeking to place Smith on the defensive, he repeatedly cites  state statistics showing that Smith's office prosecuted just under 50% of the  felony arrests in San Francisco in 1988. Smith has called the statistics  misleading.  </P> <P> Lungren also has publicized letters from Smith's boss during the early 1980s,  then-Mayor Dianne Feinstein, questioning Smith's performance as district  attorney. Feinstein, now running for governor as a Democrat, has responded by  praising Smith.  </P> <P> Lungren's first TV campaign ad questioned Smith's crime-fighting prowess in the  prosecution of influential San Francisco businessman Donald Werby, a onetime  Smith campaign contributor. Smith, citing problems with the evidence, recently  accepted a misdemeanor plea bargain from Werby on sex and drug charges  involving teen-age prostitutes.  </P> <P> "I've been in politics since I was 6 and I've seen lots of races where people  did not take their opponent seriously until the day after the vote -- when it  was too late," said Lungren, 44. "There are weaknesses in his record, to be  sure. Obviously, we're going to point those out."  </P> <P> Smith has reacted by stressing his experience and by trying to out-tough  Lungren on certain crime issues. After Lungren called for life sentences for  criminals convicted of kidnaping for the purpose of rape, Smith announced his  support for the death penalty in rape and kidnaping cases where victims suffer  great physical harm. Smith also has called for mandatory incarceration in  first-time convictions of drug dealers.  </P> <P> Experts say the outcome of the Smith-Lungren race could hinge on the success of  their TV ad campaigns. At this point, it is unclear just how much money either  candidate will raise for his final push.  </P> <P> Campaign finance reports filed Oct. 5 showed that Smith had $299,000 while  Lungren had $106,000, having spent more than $200,000 on his first two TV ads.  </P> <P> With a federal court recently declaring unconstitutional the fund-raising  limits established by Proposition 73, Smith and Lungren have the opportunity to  add considerably to their war chests.  </P> <P> Lungren's ads have appeared to had limited impact in the polls. In fact, the  Werby attack ad generated a backlash of negative editorials.  </P> <P> Smith is expected to wait until the final days of the campaign to launch a  statewide TV ad blitz.  </P> <P> "We simply have to lay out the case on abortion, environment and job  qualifications," said Dann, Smith's campaign manager. "The electorate is tired  of mudslinging. . . . But if he attacks us, we're not going to get our face  kicked in. We're not going to take it."  </P></p>

			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Some bend in a hard market debate - Some of the heat has come out of the clash over steel sales / Trade Across Europe THERE is a giant with his foot in the door, says Mr Ruprecht Vondran, president of the German Steel Federation. He has already overturned a few chairs, but that should not prevent us from inviting him in and offering him a seat. We should take care, however, that 'he does not bring the roof down, or even the whole house to tumble around our ears'. Mr Vondran's colourful language, in a recent speech in Berlin, was a reference to imports of steel from the former Comecon countries, a giant of the world steel industry with more than 210m tonnes of crude production capacity. Yet, after two years of east-west recrimination and amid continuing recession in the European steel market, it now looks less likely that the house will tumble down. About three-quarters of the old eastern bloc's steel production is in the former Soviet Union, but it is the remaining 56m tonnes, largely in Romania, Poland and the Czech and Slovak Republics, that is being blamed for adding to the problems of German and other western European steel companies in the past two years. The European Community's trade balance with the former Comecon countries has shifted from a deficit of 400,000 tonnes in 1989 to nearly 4m tonnes last year. More than 80 per cent of the 4.8m tonnes exported to the leading western buyer countries goes to the EC and countries of the European Free Trade Association. Last year, about 380,000 tonnes of steel a month reached the EC from the old Comecon countries, with the former Czechoslovakia and the Commonwealth of Independent States accounting for about 250,000 tonnes in total, and the rest shared in descending order by Poland, Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria. Imports from the eastern countries to the EC generated considerably more heat than might seem justified by the market share they took last year - just 3 per cent. But western producers complained loudly that unfairly subsidised eastern European steel, mainly long products such as reinforcing bar for concrete, merchant bars and wire rod, undercut the price of western equivalents and further destabilised an already weak market. Whatever the merits of the case, there is little doubt that exports to the EC have provided a lifeline for the eastern producers. Mr Jeremy Fletcher, an independent steel consultant, says the east European producers have seen domestic demand for steel fall sharply, but have been more affected by a breakdown in the financial system which means customers cannot pay for steel. On top of that, steel prices have been kept artificially low in domestic markets to enhance the competitiveness of the customer base in industry. Consequently, the western European market and prices look attractive. More than that, however, exports to the EC have generated cash that has been reinvested in the east's nascent modernisation efforts. 'That's a very good thing,' says Mr Fletcher, 'as it is saving the west a lot of money.' Although ceilings are being placed for three years on imports of Czech wire rod, and various hot- and cold-rolled steels from both the Czech and Slovak republics, the prevailing trend is towards free trade. It is clear both western and eastern producers have taken note of the political realities in Brussels, which is unwilling to block eastern producers out of their closest export markets - because of the wider issues involved for the fledgling democracies - and yet painfully aware of the western producers' problems. But the approach of the eastern producers has also changed. 'In the first two years they were so nave, selling at prices so far below the market that they were not getting the full benefit,' says Mr Fletcher. 'Now they are getting better revenues and profits from limited volumes.' Steel imports from eastern Europe to the EC are likely to continue to rise, but not greatly, experts say. 'I can see them steadily increasing over the next few years, although not to 10m tonnes or anything like that,' says Mr Peter Fish, managing director of the Sheffield-based steel consultancy Meps Europe. From 1994, he says, the relationship will be much like that between the EC and Efta countries - 'living together in slightly different trading blocs, making agreements and then getting on with it,' he says. But, for at least the next five years, the cash generated from sales in Europe will remain crucial to financing the eastern producers' moves to raise efficiency, close the most outdated capacity and wean themselves from indirect subsidies such as cheap ore. That modernisation process still has a long way to go, and has gone furthest in Poland and the Czech and Slovak republics. But western producers and spokesmen such as Mr Vondran see the process as a crucial quid pro quo for allowing eastern companies a foot in the door at home - and eventually forging the two industries into one. There will be further articles on trade between eastern and western Europe in coming weeks</p>

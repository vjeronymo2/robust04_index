			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by A. Alimov, department chief, Republic of </F> Uzbekistan Goskomprognostat [State Committee for Statistical  Forecasting], and E. Salimov, responsible organizer, Republic of  Uzbekistan Supreme Soviet Committee for Economic Reform,  Budgetary Policy, and Local Self-Government, under rubric  "Facets of Reforms":"Uzbekistan Is Improving the Climate for  Investors"]    [Text] At the present time the economic reforms in  Uzbekistan are entering a new stage, which is typified by the  expansion of the scope of market reforms; a substantial increase  in the role of economic regulators; the creation of a  competitive environment and a resources-saving economic  mechanism; and the intensification of the selectivity of the  state support of the material-production branches and the  specific addressing of the population's social protection.    Steps are being implemented to stabilize and assure the  further guaranteeing of the increase in production, including a  consideration of the dynamic attraction of foreign capital; and  to reinforce the financial system and monetary circulation on  the basis of the introduction of a national monetary unit. The  republic has begun to carry out structural reforms aimed at  overcoming the raw-materials nature of the economy and at  increasing the share of finished, competitive output produced.    The work in all sectors of the economic reform received a  new  impetus after the issuance of the January Edict of the President  of the Republic of Uzbekistan, entitled "Measures to Achieve the  Further Deepening of the Economic Reforms, to Guarantee the  Protection of Private Property, and to Develop  Entrepreneurship." The enactment of that edict is the latest in  a series of crucial steps on the path of carrying out  socioeconomic reforms. Indisputably, that document will promote  the further rise in Uzbekistan's prestige on the international  scene and the reinforcing of its economic and political  sovereignty. Finally, that document has become new testimony to  the fact that the young state is faithful to the course of the  gradual implementation of reforms. Thanks to its unique path --  the correct determination of the rules and forms of the  transition to a market economy --and thanks to the gradual  formation of market relations, last year and in the first  quarter of the current year Uzbekistan managed to prevent a  sharp reduction in the economic indicators and achieved definite  success in producing manufactured output.    In addition to the previously enacted laws governing  foreign-economic activity, foreign investments, property,  entrepreneurship, banking activity, etc., this edict has been  called upon to effect a fundamental change in the current  economic situation in the country.    The reform program is in acute need of resources, highly  trained specialists, and the latest technologies. There is not a  single branch that does not require radical modernization and  major investments. Our country is currently faced with the  serious problems not only of "our daily bread," but also of mass  computerization, the creation of a technical production base,  education and public health, modern means of communication,  ecological safety, new energy sources, and many, many other  ones. It is obvious that no one other than ourselves is capable  of resolving these vitally important tasks and of making a  breakthrough.    But there is something else that is true: history has given  us such a short period of time that we cannot disregard even one  chance out of a thousand. This chance -- and it is no small one  -- offers us time. We are discussing the truly massive and  purposeful attraction of foreign capital to our economy.    Under the conditions that have developed, the broad  attraction of foreign investments would provide that gain in  time that is so necessary for us. Experience that would be  beneficial here is the Russian experience of the 1920's  concessions and especially the present-day practice of  transnational business, and of foreign entrepreneurship in the  world's developed and developing countries.    The situation cannot be summarized simply as the obtaining  from without of the resources and technologies that we lack,  although, in and of itself, that alone would accelerate the  process of getting our country out of its present situation. In  these actions one can discern one of the incentives that  facilitate the difficult process of gradually assimilating the  market mechanisms of management, of creating for that purpose  the necessary competitive basis of an antimonopoly mechanism,  and, in the long view, an open economy.    As a truly inexhaustible market for the investment of  capital, the Republic of Uzbekistan currently is carrying out  consistently an open foreign-economic policy that is aimed at  the successful solution of the problem of integrating its  economy into the world economy.    The foreign-economic ties that are based on the active use  of  the advantages of the international division of labor must  become an important factor in increasing the national income.  The success of resolving the problem of including the republic  in world economic space requires the carrying out of major,  fundamental reforms, the diversification of the production  structure, and the qualitative development of all forms and  types of foreign-economic activity.    During the pat two years the foreign-economic reform in the  republic moved noticeably ahead, primarily in its legal and  organizational aspects. Practically speaking, all the necessary  republic-level institutional structures have been formed. The  Ministry of Foreign Economic Ties; the National Bank of  Foreign-Economic Activity; and the customs services are  operating successfully. Corresponding functional subdivisions  are operating in the republic's government, ministries and  departments, and local agencies of self-government. A  republic-wide international-trade complex is being created.    A base of normative law has been created to permit  enterprises to go independently into the foreign market. That  base encourages the creation of new economic-organizational  structures, including enterprises with foreign investments, and  provides reliable guarantees for the activity of the foreign  investors on the republic's territory in conformity with  international norms and rules.    At the same time, the attraction of foreign investors  remains  one of the problems in the resolving of which our republic has  been encountering definite difficulties.    As has been indicated by an analysis of the activity of  joint  ventures, there still exist problems and tasks that must be  resolved by means of state regulation. For example, most of the  SP [joint ventures] (more than 70 percent) are situated in the  cities of Tashkent and Samarkand. In addition, enterprises with  foreign investments that are very capital-intensive and that  have social importance are being created basically only on the  initiative of the republic's government in the fuel-and-energy,  metallurgical, chemical, machine-building, and cotton-processing  branches, which from the beginning have been oriented on local  raw materials and the production of output to replace imported  items. Enterprises that can serve as an example are the joint  ventures that were created with such well-known companies as Deu  Corporation (South Korea), Rank Xerox (Great Britain), Bursel  (Turkey), Buller (Switzerland), Newmont (United States), and a  number of others.    The course aimed at increasing the activity rate of  attracting foreign investments and at increasing the  effectiveness of the activity of the joint ventures raises, for  the republic's state agencies, a number of qualitatively new  tasks that are being resolved on the basis of chiefly economic  methods of management under conditions of the transitional  period. This is a guarantee to private entrepreneurship and to  the successful formation and stabilization of market relations.    Foreign investors in the republic are granted broad  opportunities, including the right to purchase on a competitive  basis, for investment purposes, production areas, building,  equipment, and housing, and to take out long-term leases on  land. In addition, the question of expanding foreign capital in  the privatization program is being worked out.    In order to provide the necessary financial and economic  guarantees for foreign investors, a state company for insuring  investments -- Uzbekinvest -- is being created under the  Ministry of Finance, and some of the republic's gold-currency  resources are being transferred to it.    A very important incentive factor is preferential taxation.  In conformity with the legislation that is in effect, provision  is made for freeing enterprises with foreign investments from  payment of income tax for a period of two years after obtaining  the first profit. The President's edict has freed from taxation  that part of the income of enterprises with the participation of  foreign capital which is reinvested into the expansion of  production, technological modernization, and the implementation  of social programs. The rate of the income tax of a foreign  investor that is being transferred abroad has been reduced to 10  percent. Joint ventures that specialize in the production of  producer goods, in which the share of foreign capital in the  statutory fund exceeds 50 percent, are freed for a period of  five years, starting with the moment of registration, from  mandatory sale of part of their currency proceeds to the Central  Bank.    Something that is becoming an important factor is the  developing system of international treaties that regulate both  the general principles of commercial and economic activity and  the principles of investment cooperation. Agreements of  incentive and the reciprocal protection of investments have been  concluded with West Germany, Turkey, South Korea, Indonesia,  Malaysia, and India.    The question arises: why -- given the stable political and  economic situation in the republic; the consistency in the  actions of the Supreme Soviet and the President of the Republic  of Uzbekistan in guaranteeing the legislative basis for  protecting the investments; the very rich natural and  raw-materials potential; and the favorable climatic conditions  --aren't foreign investors rushing into Uzbekistan?    Without a doubt, there are both subjective and objective  reasons. We are taking our first steps, without having any prior  experience; we are being hindered by inertia in thought  processes; the bureaucracy; etc. But this is a market. No one is  waiting for anyone here. There is no time here to seek the  reasons, whether objective or subjective. We must move ahead. We  must succeed and resolve issues.    A very important question that requires urgent development  is  the creation of conditions that guarantee an assurance to  foreign investors of capital that the projects to be carried out  by them will be profitable. In this situation we are talking not  only about specific terms that guarantee the foreign capital  against political risks, against a change in legislation,  against nationalization and compulsory requisition with the  cessation of investment activity, but also about the creation of  completely valid market space, in which the joint ventures,  foreign companies, and their branches would have the opportunity  to function under conditions of free entrepreneurship that are  natural for them.    The new law, entitled "Foreign Investments and Guarantees  for  the Activity of Foreign Investors," which was approved by the  recent session of the Republic of Uzbekistan Supreme Soviet, is,  as it were, a logical continuation, supplement, and further  development of the Law entitled "Foreign Investments in the  Republic of Uzbekistan," with a consideration of the changed  attitudes toward the problem of foreign investments under the  new conditions.    In the final analysis, a decisive role is played  specifically  by the legislation that regulates the activity of foreign  investors and that must necessarily guarantee them, in addition  to all the other favorable circumstances, economic incentives.  We realize that without such incentives it is difficult to count  on any significant influx of foreign capital, especially under  the present-day conditions, when the countries that are  experiencing an acute need for foreign financing are actually  competing among themselves in creating a more favorable  investment climate for foreign companies.    The law entitled "Foreign Investments and Guarantees for the  Activity of Foreign Investors" defines the overall legal,  organizational, economic, and social conditions of investment  activity on the territory of the Republic of Uzbekistan. It is  aimed at guaranteeing favorable conditions for national and  foreign subjects of investment activity, and at guaranteeing the  state protection of the rights, interests, ownership, and the  industrial intellectual property of the subjects of investment  activity, irrespective of the forms of ownership, for purposes  of the effective development of the republic's socially oriented  market economy, as well as for purposes of integrating  Uzbekistan's economy into the worldwide economic system.    This law defines the state's foreign and domestic investment  policy, which is aimed at creating financial markets, output  (commodities and services) markets, and a labor market, and at  types of vestments, and a procedure for carrying out investment  activity depending upon the investment regulations that are in  effect on the territory of Uzbekistan; and also defines the  forms and procedure for the state's coordination and monitoring  of the carrying out of investment activity.    The law provides a new definition of enterprises with  foreign  investments. Usinit the sizeg the international practice (the  definition of the International Currency Fund), as well as  bilateral agreements of the Republic of Uzbekistan concerning  the procedure for excluding dual taxation, the law stipulates a  low limit in the share of foreign participation in enterprises  -- no less than 10 percent of the holding (stock or shares),  which limit falls within the jurisdiction of the preferential  taxation situation stipulated by legislation for enterprises  with foreign investments.    It is necessary in the republic to strive for precision,  stability, and consistency in the regulation of investments. The  formation of this regulation must proceed in the direction of  unifying the efforts in the activity of the domestic and foreign  investors in Uzbekistan. In worldwide practice this is  characterized as "natural regulation," the sense of which lies  in a nondiscriminatory attitude toward foreign investors. The  task consists in creating equal regulation for domestic and  foreign investors in our republic.    In addition, during the transitional period at the initial  stages of the reform it is necessary to grant foreign investors  definite benefits that are aimed at reducing the risk of losing  their capital. In particular, the article indicated emphasizes  that, for foreign investors who are being directed into the  priority branches of the economy and into the regions, the  legislation of the Republic of Uzbekistan can establish  additional benefits. And Article 11 establishes a procedure in  accordance with which the tax system that was in effect at the  moment of concluding the contract will be preserved for no less  then ten years.    The experience of recent years and worldwide practice  indicate that for the broad attraction of foreign capital it is  necessary first of all to provide economic guarantees.    A way out is seen in the creation of a system for insuring  foreign investments in our republic. The use for this purpose of  only foreign insurance companies will not make it possible to  resolve the problem completely. First, the insurance itself will  be rather expensive. Secondly, and this is more important, the  scope of attraction of investments will be extremely limited:  the insurance companies will limit the size of the investments  in a single "client," and the investors will not view the  guarantees as being complete, inasmuch as, in the event of  actual loss of capital in Uzbekistan, that can cause a definite  overload in the foreign insurance system.    Therefore what would seem to most promising is the broad  attraction for insuring investments of a definite part of the  state gold-currency reserves and the creation of a National  Insurance Company, as well as, jointly with the world's leading  insurance companies, an International Insurance Fund.    On the whole, the law has been called upon to provide a  qualitative turning away from measures of a limiting nature and  bans toward a legal policy of intelligently admissible  liberalization and to the dynamic attraction of foreign capital  into the republic. The attraction of foreign investments to  Uzbekistan is proceeding along the path of creating an open  market economy, and, consequently, an effective one.</p>

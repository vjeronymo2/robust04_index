			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / UN Sanctions Against Serbia: Moves to end trade and freeze assets TRADING links between the Serbian-led remnant of Yugoslavia and the rest of the world were severed yesterday, one day after the UN Security Council imposed a package of comprehensive sanctions. In Britain, the Treasury moved early today to block Serbian assets, saying this would take effect from midnight last night. There may be some problems as banks try to disentangle assets held by Serbia and its ally Montenegro, the target of sanctions, and the other former Yugoslav states. The trade ban in Britain meant some 50-60 UK companies which have acquired export licences to supply goods to Serbia and Montenegro will be told today these have been revoked. The government has to obtain an order in council under the Emergency Powers Act letting the Bank of England issue notices to the commercial banks freezing assets. Similar measures imposed when Iraq invaded Kuwait were taken within 24 hours. Yugoslavia has been reducing assets held overseas in expectation of sanctions; assets in the UK are now thought to be less than Dollars 500m (Pounds 277.7m) against nearly Dollars 600m in June 1991. The freeze would apply to assets held on behalf of government bodies, banks and commercial organisations. It was not clear if this covered private individuals' assets. Trade sanctions cover exports to and imports from Serbia and Montenegro, and any activity meant to promote trade with those countries. Goods already shipped and imports already in transit will be allowed to complete their journeys. Airline flights to and from those destinations are also barred under the UN sanctions. In Belgrade the Tanjug news agency said Germany, Switzerland and the Netherlands had enforced the ban. UK exports to Yugoslavia amounted to Pounds 194m in 1991 against imports from that country of Pounds 148m. The top five export categories included telecommunications equipment (Pounds 32m).</p>

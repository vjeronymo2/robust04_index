			<p><P> March 19, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SIMI VALLEY MAKES MOST OF 8 ERRORS IN 10-5 WIN  </P> <P> For Simi Valley High, Saturday's nonleague game against Crespi was little more  than a tune-up for Marmonte League play. But for the Celts, it was a comedy of  errors.  </P> <P> The Pioneers took advantage of eight Crespi errors -- five in the fifth inning  -- to score six unearned runs en route to a 10-5 victory at home.  </P> <P> "We stink. That's all there is to it," Crespi Coach Scott Muckey said. "I  thought it was the worst high school baseball game I've ever seen."  </P> <P> Simi Valley (8-1) struck early, scoring three runs in the first inning on a  single, two doubles and a walk off Crespi starter Chad Nichols (1-2).  </P> <P> A two-run double by Greg Santos and an RBI double by Jeff Sommer were the big  hits.  </P> <P> Crespi (2-4-2) answered by sending nine batters to the plate in a five-run  second. Simi Valley starter Mike Jenkins (1-0) walked in the first run and  bases-loaded doubles by Nichols and Mark Maurizi drove in two runs each.  </P> <P> "We had a real shaky second inning," Simi Valley Coach Mike Scyphers said.  "There were a couple of balls that should have been caught, and Jenkins lost  his composure a little bit."  </P> <P> Jenkins, who struck out four, walked three and gave up three hits in the  inning.  </P> <P> But Crespi's lead was short-lived as the Celts committed two crucial errors  that contributed to two of Simi Valley's three runs in the third inning.  </P> <P> The Pioneers already had pushed across one run and had a runner on first when  Andy Hodgins grounded to third. Brodie Van Wagonen, trying for an inning-ending  double play, threw wildly to second, allowing Hodgins to reach safely and  sending Jesse Anguiano to third.  </P> <P> Anguiano scored the tying run when the next batter, Terry Hill rapped a  grounder to short, but Maurizi dropped the ball and his throw to second was not  in time to get Hodgins. Santos followed with a single between third and short,  allowing Hodgins to score the deciding run.  </P> <P> The Pioneers added four more runs in the fifth to account for the final score.  Crespi committed five errors in that inning to help Simi Valley seal its fourth  consecutive win.  </P> <P> With two out, Jenkins reached base when Maurizi's throw bounced in the dirt  past Scott Barton, allowing Kenny Hood to score from second. Hood should have  been the third out of the inning, but his fly ball was dropped by Don Calabria  in center field.  </P> <P> Pat Bennett, pitching in relief of Nichols, then walked Mike Morano and on the  fourth ball, catcher John Dempsey tried to pick Jenkins off third. The throw  skipped past third into left field and Jenkins scored, increasing Simi Valley's  lead to 8-5. Morano scored on another Dempsey throwing error after Chadd  Johnson's single to center.  </P> <P> Johnson scored the final run on Anguiano's single to shallow left.  </P></p>

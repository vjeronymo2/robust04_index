			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Letter: Pharmaceutical prices to NHS do not allow for excess profits Sir, Mr Sonabend (Letters, October 30) was incorrect on two counts when he implied that pharmaceutical companies were exploiting Britain's National Health Service. First, in unfavourably comparing the price of insulin in the US and France with the 'notional' price in the UK he overlooked the fact that the pharmaceutical price regulation scheme (PPRS) ensures that British taxpayers get value for money from the suppliers of medicines to the NHS. Under this scheme, companies are allowed a target return on capital in respect of their range of products which they may or may not achieve but must not exceed. Any excess profit is repaid to the government. Second, Mr Sonabend has been highly selective. A recent price index for prescription medicines produced by the Swedish pricing authority showed that in relation to Sweden (equalling 100) the figures for other European countries were as follows: Switzerland (136), the Netherlands (132), Denmark (130), Germany (192), Finland (111), Norway (103), the UK (99), Italy (95), Belgium and Austria (93), and France (65).

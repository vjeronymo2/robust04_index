			<p>BFN     [Text] Brother Faysal Bin-'Uthman Bin-Shamlan, minister of  oil and mineral resources, returned to Sanaa this evening from  working visits to the United Kingdom and France. The brother  minister told the Yemeni News Agency, SABA', that he held talks  during his visit to London with executives of some British  investment firms, especially those active in the area of oil  exploration in the Republic of Yemen. These firms, he  indicated, have shown a readiness to send their experts back to  resume work as early as this week alongside the local personnel  who have stayed on their job. Brother Bin-Shamlan added that he  held similar talks in the French capital, Paris, with officials  of the Totale [word indistinct] about the exploitation of the  (Jannah) oilfield in implementation of a Cabinet decision. The  brother minister said the producing companies, like (Hans) and  (Sanvienee Ofti) have not halted their operations.</p>

"All this stuff  about boiling water or putting sterilizing tablets in the water -- I've never  boiled or sterilized water anywhere in my life and I've drunk it out of every  ditch and drain that I've been to."  </P> <P> That is part of the Thesiger ethic of exploration. Wherever he has traveled --  in Africa, Arabia or the Hindu Kush -- his goal has been to meet the people "on  level terms."  </P> <P> "I wanted no concessions," he said. "All I wanted then was to live and be as  near to them as I could possibly be. I've no desire to be an Englishman when  I'm traveling about."  </P> <P> Harold St. John Philby, another great explorer of Arabia, "told me that he  always took a radio, wireless, whatever you call it, along with him so that he  could listen to the (cricket) test matches," Thesiger said. "Well, this to me  would wreck the whole thing."  </P> <P> Coupled with that outlook is an abiding dislike for change -- all change. Cars  and airplanes have "diminished the world and robbed it of all diversity," he  said, and pop music, which now reaches the darkest corners that he has  explored, "exasperates me."  </P> <P> Man's landing on the moon, Thesiger has written, filled him "with a sense of  desecration, and of despair at the deadly technical ingenuity of modern man."  </P> <P> His love of the wild began in Ethiopia, where his father was a diplomat. At age  6 he watched the homecoming of the Ethiopian tribes from battle and was  reminded of Homer's Iliad.  </P> <P> He wrote that it "implanted in me a lifelong craving for barbaric splendor, for  savagery, color and the throb of drums, and . . . a lasting veneration for  long-established custom and ritual."  </P> <P> Sent home to Eton, he became a solitary boy, knowing nothing about cricket or  the English way of life, pining for Ethiopia. He went back after Oxford  University, and at 23 discovered the source of the Awash River, roaming among  the Danakil people, who measured their bravery by the number of men they killed  and castrated.  </P> <P> Thesiger crossed the dunes of Arabia's Empty Quarter on foot and camel both  ways, subsisting on a pint of water a day. He ran secret desert missions in  World War II, then spent seven years on and off with the Marsh Arabs, living  among the reeds of the Shatt-al-Arab delta, emerging every six weeks or so for  a hot bath.  </P> <P> As a boy, he accompanied his father to Aden and stood in a trench watching  Turkish shells bursting. In Africa, he was wakened one night by what he thought  was snoring, shook the supposed offender lying beside him and found it to be a  lion.  </P> <P> He leads a simple life in Maralal, about 150 miles northwest of Nairobi, with  Lawi, Kiberiti and Laputa, local men who attached themselves to him as boys,  grew up as his foster sons, and now have families of their own.  </P> <P> When in England, he said, "I conform to all the rules. You've found me dressed  like this because I haven't been out, but normally I should be in a dark suit  and going off to my club."  </P> <P> Thesiger sees himself as the explorer who shut the door behind him, in the  sense that the places he traveled have been tainted since by the cassette tape  and the charter airline. Travel on foot or camelback, when you can do it by  jeep, "becomes a stunt," he said.  </P> <P> "I meet a lot of young people who come along to me and say, 'Look here, we'd  love to lead your life.' And I'm afraid the only thing one can say is that it  isn't there."  </P> <P> Thesiger laughs a lot, especially at himself when he stumbles over long  sentences: "I'm getting all muddled up. This is old age."  </P> <P> He tells funny stories, about grunting at the lions in Hyderabad Zoo so they  grunted back, or teasing the late Joy Adamson of "Born Free" fame by saying all  animals belong in zoos.  </P> <P> "She rose to her feet and her hands went like that" -- he made a clawing  gesture and imitated her Austrian accent -- "and she said, 'How dare you say a  sing like zzat to me!' . . . She had no sense of humor."  </P> <P> Talking about the marshes, Thesiger lapses into fond reminiscence:  </P> <P> "In the evening, we'd be sitting in one of these reed houses and Falih would  pick up a drum and start tapping like this, and others would get in their  canoes and come over; the room would be absolutely packed, the walls would  bulge outwards with people in there. And then, two or three little 14-year-olds  would start dancing in the middle of the room and everybody would be singing."  </P> <P> In his study are family photos, a string of Syrian worry beads, swords from Abu  Dhabi and Oman, and a Kenyan snuffbox.  </P> <P> On the floor stands his mother's ancient radio, which he tried, none too  successfully, to tune to the BBC.  </P> <P> He isn't isolated, he insisted; he does know about "strange things" happening  in Eastern Europe, and that "Gorbachev got hooted at the other day" by angry  crowds in Red Square.  </P> <P> Thesiger never married, and intends to be buried without ceremony in the garden  at Maralal.  </P> <P> Recently, he went to the British Embassy in Nairobi to put that desire on  record, lest people say, " 'Lawi didn't even take the trouble to get him  properly buried, just shoved him in a hole in the garden.' Which is what I want  him to do."  </P></p>

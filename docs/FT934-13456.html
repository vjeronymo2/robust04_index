			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / International Company News: Bristol-Myers blames currency movements for static quarter BRISTOL-MYERS Squibb, one of the world's biggest drugs companies, yesterday reported a 3 per cent rise in third quarter net income on sales which slid 3 per cent. For the three months to September 30, Bristol-Myers had net income of Dollars 608m or Dollars 1.18 a share on sales of Dollars 2.86bn. A year earlier, it earned Dollars 589.2m, or Dollars 1.14 on sales of Dollars 2.95bn, including earnings from discontinued operations of Dollars 17.4m. Like its competitors, Bristol Myers has been hit by pressure to reduce drugs prices. The company blamed unfavourable exchange rate fluctuations and government costs containment measures in some European countries for its sales shortfall in the quarter. Mr Richard Gelb, chairman and chief executive, also blamed the decline on a comparison with a very strong third quarter for pharmaceutical sales last year. In the latest quarter, Bristol Myers' pharmaceutical sales fell 4 per cent in spite of higher sales for several new products including its cholesterol-lowering Pravachol, its Videx AIDS medication and the Taxol cancer-fighting drug. Sales of Capoten, a cardiovascular drug, continued to erode. Sales of medical devices were flat, while consumer product sales dropped 3 per cent, reflecting strong competition in the US analgesics and hair care markets. For the nine months, net earnings were Dollars 1.7bn, or Dollars 3.30, on sales of Dollars 8.42bn. In the same period of 1992, the company earned Dollars 1.38bn, or Dollars 2.67 including earnings from its Drackett household products business which was sold in December and from a charge of Dollars 246m for accounting changes. Earnings from continuing operations rose 8 per cent to Dollars 1.7bn from Dollars 1.58bn. Sales edged up to Dollars 8.42bn from Dollars 8.33bn.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Valeriy Katukov, manager of the Department </F> for Organizational-Technical Support of the Activity of the  Government of the Russian Federation, by Yuriy Mikhaylov; place  and date not given: "Privileges Have Ended. Forget about Them!"]    [Text] [Mikhaylov] It is known that the government staff  has been reorganized. But what has happened to the traditional  nomenklatura privileges of the current civil servants? We have  fought for so long and fiercely against them that, in principle,  we were supposed to have abolished privileges a long time ago...    [Katukov] If you will permit me, first about the  reorganization of the staff of the Government of the Russian  Federation. In our view, the staff has become more compact and  significantly more efficient. A number of subdivisions have been  eliminated, and now the staff of the Government of Russia  consists of 17 departments and three directorates (juridical,  organizational-technical, and record-keeping directorates) and  the secretariats of the chairman of the Government of the  Russian Federation and his deputies.    As for "privileges," let us agree on terms. Take a computer,  typewriter, or a dictaphone for a journalist--are these  privileges, or instruments that are necessary for work? It is  generally recognized that "privileges" are a certain kind of  additional or above-norm advantages or benefits, if you wish,  that have nothing to do with the nature of the work. This  relates in different degrees to a worker, a farmer, and an  office employee, including a government official. Everything a  government official needs, depending on the volume and nature of  the work he performs, is stipulated and described in special  documents.    [Mikhaylov] Telephone apparatuses with special  communications  were always the pride of the former party nomenklatura. As far  as I know, they have not vanished even now. Who has the right  today to use "secure government communications" with the state  seal on the dial disk?    [Katukov] With respect to special communications, the circle  of persons who have the right to use it is regulated by the  "List of Positions of Managerial Workers of the Russian  Federation That Are Furnished Governmental Communications."    [Mikhaylov] But precisely what is this kind of  communications?    [Katukov] Precisely telephones of the government ATS  [Automated Telephone Station] that are commonly called "secure  government communications," which guarantee confidentiality in  conversations both within the bounds of the city of Moscow and  between cities (PM-communications--government long-distance).    [Mikhaylov] What are the staff salaries of senior government  officials now?    [Katukov] Staff salaries are established by an authorized  staff schedule. In accordance with this document, a federal  minister has a salary of 312,000 rubles [R]. The rest of the  existing percentage additions to position salary are for  difficult and special work regimes and an addition for length of  service similar to that which exists in other state institutions  and enterprises.    [Mikhaylov] And what are the salaries of the president and  the prime minister?    [Katukov] The staff salary of the president of the Russian  Federation is R467,900, and of the chairman of the  government--R422,400. Practically no government makes a secret  of this, and ours is no exception.    [Mikhaylov] To whom in the Government of Russia is a  personal  car now available?    [Katukov] In answering your question, I would like to note  immediately that the question concerns official motor vehicle  transport exclusively. On the staff of the Government of the  Russian Federation this right is possessed by chiefs of  departments and directorates, managers of the secretariats of  the chairman of the Government of the Russian Federation and his  deputies, and assistants (advisers) of the chairman of the  Government of the Russian Federation.    [Mikhaylov] And the ministers?    [Katukov] Federal ministers and the directors of other  federal departments of the Russian Federation also have the  right to use official motor vehicle transport year round in  accordance with the nature and volume of their work. As a rule,  this is a Volga GAZ 3102 or GAZ 31029.    [Mikhaylov] But some ride in Mercedes? I wonder who?    [Katukov] Still fresh in our memory are the times when an  enormous number of government ZIL's and Chayka's--which the  people called "member-carriers" [chlenovoz]--were driven around  Moscow. The picture is different today. It is no secret that the  operation of that same armored government ZIL is not comparable  to the financial costs of the foreign make that you mentioned  and is not in the domestic limousine's favor. The assignment of  a Mercedes to higher staff personnel is made through special  decisions. This decision was made in the Government of Russia  with respect to the first deputy chairman of the Government of  the Russian Federation and the managers of federal, commonly  so-called "power," ministries and departments: Defense, Internal  Affairs, Foreign Affairs, the Foreign Intelligence Service, and  the Federal Counterintelligence Service.    [Mikhaylov] And who is supposed to have a security guard?    [Katukov] Guaranteeing the safety of senior government  officials also presupposes a security guard for the chairman of  the Government of the Russian Federation, his deputies, and the  managers of the "power" ministries and departments mentioned  above.    [Mikhaylov] What is happening now with the former fourth  Main  Directorate of the USSR Ministry of Health? At one time its  splendid polyclinics served the party elite. And now?    [Katukov] If you have no objection, I would make a  correction--not only the "party elite" but also workers of the  central staffs of the former CPSU Central Committee and the  Council of Ministers.    At the present time it is the Medical Center under the  Government of the Russian Federation that serves the workers of  the central staffs of the Federal Assembly, the president's  office, the government, and the Supreme Court, the  Constitutional Court, and the Court of Arbitration, and, also,  as before, a number of institutions of culture, science and  education, and specific individuals whose services were  especially noted by the state.    [Mikhaylov] But what about government dachas? Who is now  supposed to get a year-round suburban dacha?    [Katukov] The existing "Statute on Procedure for Granting  Accommodations for Rest in Dacha Communities and in Pension and  Rest Homes" provides for year-round paid use of dachas. This  right is given to those officials who also get an official  vehicle. The exception are assistants (advisers) to the chairman  of the Government of the Russian Federation who are granted rest  accommodations in the summer period.    [Mikhaylov] And ministers?    [Katukov] Ministers and managers of federal organs of the  executive branch also have the right to year-round use of dachas  that are within the jurisdiction of the administration of  affairs of the president of the Russian Federation, but their  deputies do not.    In addition, the area granted is in accordance with the size  of the family, and payment is in cash.    [Mikhaylov] What is the situation now with distributors for  special clientele? I have in mind special food rations, special  sections in GUM [state department store], and special shops.    [Katukov] Let us ask ourselves the question: "What is the  feasibility of maintaining special clientele distributors, given  existing real life in Moscow? After all, practically everything  can be bought now in a regular store. There are no longer any  kind of special food rations and special sections. The network  of shops, it is true, remains. You can have whatever you like  made for yourself, but for your own hard-earned money. For  example, to have a two-piece suit made costs a client  R180-200,000 on the average, regardless of the official's  position.    [Mikhaylov] Does it not seem to you that for a majority of  government officials all these telephones, vehicles, and dachas  also give genuine meaning to their activity and are a measure of  their success in life?    [Katukov] I would not be sincere even with myself if I did  not answer unambiguously. Unquestionably, a layer of such civil  servants remains on the staff, nevertheless, the main part of  the staff of the Government of the Russian Federation consists  of respectable people, professionals. For these people, all the  things we have talked about are only an instrument in their  work--the government communications telephone, the presence or  absence of an official motor vehicle, or a dacha, never was and  never will be a criterion of their success in life. They could  have left a long time ago for "big money" and specifically for  the "benefits" that exist in other jobs with their numerous  "privileges." It seems to me that what "holds" them here is a  feeling of duty, inculcated by years of state service, and an  understanding of the fact that their experience and knowledge  are necessary now as never before.    As for state employees who live with other categories and  values in life, the present day indicates that with the  emergence of new and increased demands in their work, people  like this do not last, and they leave.    [Mikhaylov] Do you consider that a government staff employee  position is a profession?    [Katukov] Actually, this is so. Moreover, I am convinced  that  this is one of the difficult professions. If for no other reason  than that everyone has to master its ABC's on the job; after  all, we do not have diplomaed state civil servants, and higher  educational institutions do not train them.    And, by the way, my first specialty is military doctor. What  I am engaged in now in the service is a result of daily training  in the school of the government staff over several years. I do  not consider it a disgrace to learn and exchange experiences  among one's colleagues.    [Mikhaylov] What do you think is paramount in this  profession?    [Katukov] Veracity, a sense of duty, and a sense of  obligation.</p>

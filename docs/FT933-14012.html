			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Trawlermen seek judicial review on fish stocks plan THE National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations yesterday sought leave to apply for a judicial review of the government's controversial measures to conserve fish stocks by limiting time at sea. The move came in spite of a meeting described as 'productive' between fishermen's representatives and ministers. The federation said it had lodged documents at the High Court in London to support an application to suspend the legislation, due to come into force next January. Under an European Community agreement Britain must cut fishing by 19 per cent by 1996. The government has said it was willing to consider altering details of the proposals to limit the number of days fishermen can spend at sea and yesterday Mrs Gillian Shephard, the agriculture minister, Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, and Mr Michael Jack, fisheries minister, met representatives of the English, Welsh, Scottish and Northern Ireland fishing industries. The industry has been asked for ideas by the end of September and ministers will continue to meet fishermen and visit ports. The federation pointed out that ministers did not rule out bringing forward Pounds 25m for decommissioning to be phased in over three years. Mrs Shephard said the meeting was a genuine attempt to see if the government's days-at-sea proposals could be modified to meet the industry's concerns while conserving fish stocks.</p>

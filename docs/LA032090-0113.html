			<p><P> March 20, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLAN FOR FLUSHABLE DIAPERS IS ALL WET, CRITICS CLAIM  </P> <P> In a move bound to increase squalling over disposable versus cloth diapers, an  Arizona company has announced plans to manufacture a flushable disposable  plastic diaper.  </P> <P> RMED International, a Sedona, Ariz., distributor of TenderCare disposable  diapers to such retailers as Mrs. Gooch's health food supermarkets, plans to  have its diaper-making machine in place and to produce almost 100,000 a day by  May.  </P> <P> The diaper can be flushed into sewage systems, company spokesmen say, because  its new bikini shape uses 40% less material than other disposables and it is  lined with a plastic mixed with chalk. The chalk, says the company, will break  down in the acid normally found in sewage systems.  </P> <P> Environmentalists generally favor a return to reusable cloth diapers because  manufacturers of disposable diapers -- even those labeled degradable -- have  been unable to produce convincing research to show that they are harmless to  the environment. The disposables now end up in landfills; the new flushables  would end up in sewage treatment plants.  </P> <P> "There's no sense in putting extra strain on already stressed-out sewage  systems," said Lisa Collaton, of the Environmental Action Foundation's solid  waste alternatives project. "It's clearly an attempt to hold onto their part of  the disposable diaper market. . . . These companies are running wild trying to  find ways to stay in the market."  </P> <P> And there are solid indications that the disposable diaper industry is in deep  trouble. The National Assn. of Diaper Services reported a whopping 39% increase  nationwide from 1988 to 1989 in customers using cloth diapers.  </P> <P> "Flushable diapers only transfer the problem from one source to another,"  Arthur Saarinen, president of the Water Pollution Control Federation, a trade  group of waste water treatment plant operators and engineers, wrote to a trade  publication recently. "The sludge from many treatment plants goes to landfills  for disposal (anyway). . . . We will take the contents, but not the packaging."  </P> <P> Even Ecological Engineering Inc., a small waste water system-consulting firm  testing the new diapers, is less than enthusiastic.  </P> <P> "I like people who try to solve problems," said Susan Peterson, president of  Ecological Engineering, "but if I had a septic system, I wouldn't use them."  </P> <P> Neither would Peterson welcome flushable diapers if she ran a municipal sewer  system.  </P> <P> "If I could devise a flushable diaper in which all components broke down to  carbon dioxide and water, that would be great," she said. "They are part way  there."  </P></p>

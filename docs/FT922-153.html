			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Jack Chia in two-tier bid for Boustead LONDON yesterday witnessed a novel attempt by a company to gain a stock market listing when Jack Chia-MPH, the Singapore-based trading company, announced a two-tier recommended cash offer for Boustead, the languishing industrial trading group. Mr Jack Chia, the chairman who already owned 29.4 per cent of Boustead and is on its board, said he planned to become a majority shareholder and use the London quote as the plank from which to expand his group in Europe. Sir Thomas Macpherson, Boustead chairman, said shareholders who sold all their shares were being offered a 'fair' price that valued the group at Pounds 20.2m. Boustead shareholders are also, however, being offered what Sir Thomas called an 'attractive' higher price for selling only some of their stake and staying with Mr Chia as he develops his group's interests in confectionery manufacture, property and book publishing and distribution. The novelty lies in the pricing of the two tier offer. Jack Chia-MPH is offering 38p for the first 60 per cent of shares held in Boustead; this represents a 52 per cent premium over the 25p price prevailing in the market before the bid was announced yesterday. For their remaining shares, Boustead shareholders are being offered only 20p. Shareholders who choose not to go along for the ride will therefore exit at an average 30.8p, some 25.7 per cent above the closing price on Friday. Shareholders who sell only 60 per cent of their stake effectively retain the other 40 per cent at a price equivalent to about 5.5p. Early yesterday Jack Chia-MPH raised its stake by 0.6 per cent to 30 per cent, triggering a mandatory offer. Mr Chia bought a 22 per cent stake in Boustead in 1989 at about 70p. Should the offer go unconditional, Jack Chia-MPH will also have to bid for the 34.6 per cent of the shares in Bousteadco, Boustead's listed subsidiary in Singapore, which it does not already own. That offer would be unconditional at a price of SDollars 1.271 per share in cash and would value Bousteadco at Pounds 13.7m. Shareholders will also be asked to 'help ensure the offer becomes unconditional' by agreeing to elect for a so-called 'participation election'. While agreeing to accept the cash offer for 60 per cent of their holdings, they will be asked to indicate willingness to accept the offer for more shares (at the lower price) to the extent necessary to ensure the offer becomes unconditional. Jack-Chia-MPH made a pre-tax profit in the year to March 31 1992 of SDollars 7.2m (Pounds 2.5m), down from SDollars 16.5m (Pounds 5.3m), on sales of SDollars 250.4m (Pounds 86.9m).</p>

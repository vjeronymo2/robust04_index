			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yu. Nikitin: "How the Budget Was Replenished: </F> Oblast Tax Inspectorate Collegium Summarizes 1993 Work"]    [Text] Today, one can hear from everywhere: "The budget is  bursting at the seams." There is no money to pay teachers and  workers in higher schools and health services, culture, sports,  the militia, and fire fighting. Indeed, where is it to be  gotten, when there is a sharp slump in the economy, industrial  enterprises are on the brink of closing down, and there is  massive unemployment? Under these complicated conditions, the  fate of the budget depends to a great degree on the successful  organization of the work of tax organs and the completeness of  the adoption by them of all of the measures stipulated in  legislation for the receipt of payments.    M.I. Chemodurov, chief of state tax inspection for  Chelyabinsk Oblast and second rank state tax service adviser,  noted that inflation processes had an influence on the growth of  tax revenues in 1993. Simultaneously, the influence of factors  grew that restrained an increase in budgetary incomes, in  particular, the growing payment-financial crisis. According to  estimated data, about R317 billion have accumulated in produced  but unsold products. The drop in the volume of production,  temporary stoppage, and sometimes the full closing of production  determined the budgetary losses for another R260 billion.    The lack of tough incentives that prompt enterprises to  manage effectively and unpredictable changes in the formation of  prices result in increasing growth rates in product cost with  respect to sales volume and, as a consequence, profit level is  lowered. This is about another R50 billion.    Besides narrowing the tax formation base, the financial  crisis is causing high growth in defaults. According to the  status on 1 January 1994, overall it exceeded R70 billion in the  oblast, which is almost 40 times more than a year earlier.    The situation at the beginning of this year has gotten even  worse. As a result of the growth in mutual indebtedness of  enterprises (about R2 trillion), and the expansion of the  practice of mutual offsets between them, the nonpayments to the  budget increased sharply, and on 1 February 1994, R95 billion of  taxes on profits, value added, and resource payments were in  arrears. This exceeds the January sum of revenues for calculated  taxes by almost nine percent, and the gap in Magnitogorsk  amounts to a factor of 3.2....    Nevertheless, last year the oblast tax organs transferred  R1.23 trillion to the budget and off-budget funds, which is 7.6  times more than a year ago, and R751 billion were collected for  the needs of the oblast. The indicator in comparison with other  oblasts of Russia is rather high. One documentary check  conducted by the inspectorate on the average gives more than  R5.5 billion of additional income. The most effective were the  checks in Zlatoust where at one time R23.3 million more was  added, and in Kopeysk and Trekhgornyy (former Zlatoust-36),  about R13.5 million. Rural tax inspectors in a check declared  more than R6 million additional in Agapovskiy and Argayashskiy  Rayons.    One of the reserves for the replenishment of the budget is  the tax on persons who are engaged in entrepreneurial activity  without the formation of a legal entity. Last year, their number  grew by factor of 2.2, and it was in excess of 29,000 persons.  It will not be an exaggeration to say that entrepreneurs are not  the most law abiding payers. For violation of tax legislation,  3,600 persons were made answerable, and the sum of fines  amounted to R43 million. An analysis of the results of raids  conducted at mini-markets and places of unmanaged trade shows  that only three to four persons out of 10 register as  entrepreneurs.    All of this requires a definite reorientation in the work of  the service. The first experience of the oblast inspection  indicates that the creation of a specialized group of workers  who follow the activity of entrepreneurs could give a high  return. In the second half of last year, the activity of 40  young businessmen was checked by a sector numbering only four  persons, as a result of which R11.7 million more was added to  the budget. Counter checks of another 22 enterprises added  another R16 million to the budget. All told in the oblast,  according to the results of joint actions with the  Administration of Internal Affairs and the Procuracy, 250  enterprises were checked, which brought more than a half billion  rubles of income.    Every ninth ruble of revenues, or about R124 billion, was  the  share of the tax from physical persons. Under conditions when  each citizen can work in several places, enterprises and  organizations frequently forget to submit information on incomes  paid to physical persons who are not permanent employees. Only  in 3,000 of the 7,800 who were checked was the person within the  field of vision of the tax inspectors. The mass of our citizens  has not gotten into the habit of declaring incomes.    Monitoring the implementation of the Law on Monitoring  Control Cash Registers (KKM) in Conducting Monetary Calculations  With the Population brought in more than a billion rubles in  additional payments in several months of last year. According to  the law, since 1 March 1994, KKM were supposed to be in all  trade points of the oblast center, and, starting on 1 January  1995, in the entire oblast. Meanwhile, the naked eye can see  that the stalls and kiosks and even the large stores in  Chelyabinsk conduct monetary operations with the people in cash,  while not using the cash registers.    However, how is it possible to complain about the ordinary  taxpayer, if the workers of inspectorates themselves do not  succeed in understanding the numerous changes, refined points of  the edicts of the president, instructions, and other documents  of the government? The collegium appealed once again to the  managers of the central organs with a proposal to simplify the  system of taxation, to make it stable, easy to understand, and  efficient, and one that promotes the development of production.</p>

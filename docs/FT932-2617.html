			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / (CORRECTED) International Company News: MCI gains more firepower in telecoms war - BT deal is probably the most important in the US group's history Correction (published 19th June 1993) appended to this article. BOLD, brash MCI Communications, where revenues have grown from Dollars 500m a decade ago to Dollars 10bn today, has never been shy about trumpeting its merits. 'The meek may inherit the earth, but they will not take market share,' was one of the watchwords of the late Mr Bill McGowan, the chairman who masterminded MCI's growth into the second-largest US long-distance telecommunications company. So when the soft-spoken Mr Bert Roberts, MCI's current chairman, describes this month's tie-up with British Telecom as the 'telecommunications deal of the century' there is a touch of hyperbole about his remarks. Yet for MCI, the agreement with BT is probably the single most important deal in its 25-year history. The two companies agreed to form a joint venture to provide global communications services to multinational companies, while BT is also to pay Dollars 64 a share to take a 20 per cent stake in MCI for Dollars 4.3bn. The deal gives MCI far greater clout in the fast-growing international market than it could have ever gained alone, and without diverting resources from its battle in the US long-distance market against American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, the much richer market leader. BT's share purchase will also give MCI much greater financial flexibility to take advantage of the extraordinary upheaval taking place in the US, where technological and regulatory changes are pushing telephone, computer and cable television companies into new alliances to capitalise on an expected explosion of new communications services. The BT deal will cut MCI's debt as a percentage of total capital to between 20 per cent and 30 per cent, from its current level of around 52 per cent. This will give it borrowing potential which could raise its acquisitions war-chest to nearly Dollars 10bn. How it deploys this firepower will affect not only MCI's future profitability but the return the UK company gets from its investment, given that BT is paying a pricey 25 times MCI's expected 1993 earnings per share (of around Dollars 2.55) and a 23 per cent premium to the US company's share price when the deal was struck. So far, MCI has lagged its rivals in forming alliances. AT&amp;T, for example, has an agreement to buy a 33 per cent stake in McCaw Cellular, the largest group in the fast-growing radio telephony market. MCI has no cellular interests and has not yet formed any ties with the cable TV industry, which could occupy a crucial position in delivering inter-active communications and entertainment services to the home. However, Mr Roberts insists that MCI will become a force in wireless, local communications, multi-media and information services, and is at the centre of a web of discussions which include local telephone companies, cable operators and software houses. While his first priority is to complete the BT deal, which will probably not be consummated until early 1994, he expects to form some important domestic alliances over the next 18 months. Throughout its history, he adds, MCI has turned what others saw as weaknesses into opportunities and been a catalyst for change. It intends to do so again: 'When there is chaos in an industry, when people are scrambling to align themselves with somebody, when you've got everyone fumbling around . . . for MCI that means opportunity,' Mr Roberts says. There is no disputing the company's track record in shaking up the US telecoms industry, which used to be a cosy monopoly run by AT&amp;T until MCI emerged in the late 1960s and began challenging its stranglehold on the long-distance market. Key turning points came in 1978, when a ruling in an MCI court case allowed full competition in the long-distance market, and in 1984, when the break-up of AT&amp;T on anti-trust grounds ensured that alternative long-distance carriers, such as MCI, would be given equal access to the consumer by local phone companies. MCI's revenues have doubled in the past five years, while its share of the long-distance market has risen to around 18 per cent, thanks in part to this much more level playing field, combined with surging demand for long-distance services and the company's particular strengths. These include a modern digital network, a lean operating structure, keen pricing and, above all, a flair for new product development and marketing. For example, MCI's Friends and Family programme, which allows residential customers large discounts on calls to certain numbers, has grown in two years from nothing to more than 10m customers. It is hoping for similar success in the small-to-medium business market with a programme called Proof Positive. This offers rebates to customers who have not employed the most cost-effective service package. MCI also calculates how much customers are saving compared with AT&amp;T services. MCI is also shaking up the US collect-call market, which it points out has been unchanged for 100 years, by offering what it claims are savings of up to 44 per cent of AT&amp;T rates. Such innovations, coupled with increasing penetration of the market for multinational customers, means MCI's traffic volume has been growing at around 15 per cent over the past two years, roughly double the industry average. Analysts expect earnings per share increases of roughly the same size over the next two years as the US economy recovers, as MCI continues to improve operating margins and as long-distance carriers are required to pay less in 'access charges' for local telephone companies to complete calls. But this assumes that the marketing war between long-distance carriers does not intensify and that prices of calls, which are currently relatively stable, are not cut sharply in the battle for market share. The BT deal could eventually give MCI's earnings an additional fillip. Although the joint venture is expected to lose money for the first two years, it should mean economies of scale in providing inter-national services and cost-sharing in developing new software and other technology. BT's global clout should also help MCI win a greater share of US-originated international calls, where it claims a market share of around 23 per cent, though only about 10 per cent of traffic originated by multinationals. All these considerations have helped lift MCI's share price from Dollars 52 immediately before the BT deal was announced to around Dollars 55 3/4 now, and some analysts think the price could reach around Dollars 60 - close to the price BT paid - by the end of the year. But this assumes wise use of the war-chest by MCI to secure domestic partners - and a lack of new alliances among rivals. In an industry as volatile as US telecommunications, those remain substantial question marks. CORRECTION MCI Communications' net income in 1992 was Dollars 609m, up from Dollars 551m in 1991. These figures were wrongly described as pre-tax profits in Thursday's edition.</p>

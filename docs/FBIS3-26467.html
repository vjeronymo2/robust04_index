			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, 1 Feb (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- After  several years of steady development, a stock exchange network  composed of stock exchange centers, securities companies,  securities business departments, and stock transaction agencies  has taken shape in the stock market in mainland China, and up to  150,000 people are working in this profession.    It has been learned that the mainland achieved greater  development in securities administration last year. The State  Council promulgated the first group of laws and regulations on  securities management -- "Interim Regulations on the  Administration of Stock Issue and Transactions" -- to provide  the stock market with an important legal basis and guarantee.    At present, apart from establishing the two stock exchanges  in Shanghai and Shenzhen, two national stock exchange quotation  systems have been set up in the mainland. In order to guarantee  rapid, accurate, and highly effective stock transactions, more  than 17 regional stock exchange centers -- dealing primarily  with such transaction items as treasury bonds, local enterprise  bonds, and investment funds -- and 86 professional companies  running the business of various securities are being built in  the mainland. In addition, more than 370 credit investment  companies have set up securities business departments and there  are over 2,000 stock transaction agencies spreading all over the  country. Using such advanced means as computers, this stock  exchange network helps investors purchase all sorts of  securities and facilitates stock transactions at any time.</p>

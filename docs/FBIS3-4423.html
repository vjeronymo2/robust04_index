They include one first-phase work project,  four foreign- aid projects, and five projects funded by our own  region.    -- The Daliushu key water conservancy and hydro-electric  project in the Huang He Valley. Last August, the State Council  entered this project on the list of key water conservancy  projects to be started in the 1990s. In 1994, our region will  speed up the first-phase preparatory work for the Daliushu  Project and draft plans for the resettlement of people and for  rights and interests distribution so as to start constructing  the project as soon as possible.    -- The Yanhuanding Water Raising Project in the  Shaanxi-Gansu- Ningxia region. It is composed of two parts, a  project used jointly by Shaanxi, Gansu, and Ningxia, and  projects for their respective use. This year is crucial for the  construction of the project for common use. The total  investment is set at 49 million yuan, of which 22 million will  be provided by our region.    -- The Ningxia Hetao project to divert water from the Huang  He to enlarge the irrigated area south of Yinchuan. This  project, which is funded by a loan from the World Bank, is at  the final assessment stage prior to approval.    -- The Ningxia Hetao agricultural comprehensive development  project. The establishment of this project and its  implementation were approved by the State Leading Group for  Comprehensive Agricultural Development. It is an important  project for developing the Ningxia Hetao area and tackling the  irrigation problem there, for speeding up agricultural  development in the area irrigated with water from the Huang He,  and for achieving a greater capacity for further agricultural  development. This year is the final year for implementing the  second stage of the undertaking, and over 60 million yuan will  be injected into the project. It will primarily be used to  complete the transformation of 170,000 mu of medium- and  low-yield land and open up 85,000 mu of land.    -- The construction of high-yield, good quality, and highly  efficient agricultural demonstrative areas. Beginning this  year, our region will build 16 different types of demonstrative  areas characterized by high yields, good quality, and high  efficiency. They include demonstrative areas for quality rice,  licorice root, barley for beer, hops, quality fruit, and  breeding.    -- The Ningxia land transformation project. This project, a  technological project being undertaken with aid from the  European Community, began last year and will enter the stage of  full implementation this year.    -- The project to assist the poor and improve the  environment  of three counties in the Ningxia Plateau (Project 4071). This  is a comprehensive agricultural project made possible by aid  from the World Food Program to harness the little valleys in  three counties in our region, Guyuan, Pengyang and Longde. The  35th Policy and Planning Commission of the World Food Program  officially approved the establishment of the project in June  last year and has informed China that an agreement will be  signed on February 16. This project is expected to begin on 1  April. The implementation will take five years and will involve  a total investment of 112.6 million yuan.    -- The Ningxia forest protection research project. This  project is a Sino-Japanese cooperation project focusing on  special technological products. It will be completed through  joint research and experiments conducted by the Japan  International Joint Undertaking Group and our region. An  official agreement was signed on January 24 this year and  implementation will begin in April this year. Japan will  provide our area with 500 million Japanese yuan (40 million  yuan) in aid.    -- The second generation farmland-forest network project.    -- The construction of a conifer timber area in the Liupan  Mountain Area. Based on what has been achieved in the past, a  conifer timber area of 270,000 mu will be developed between this  year and 1998.</p>

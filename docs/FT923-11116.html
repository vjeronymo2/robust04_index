			<p>920727 FT  27 JUL 92 / International Company News: MTM to sell its country HQ in move to reduce borrowings MTM, the chemicals group, is to offer its country house headquarters for sale as part of its restructuring and debt reduction programme. Rudby Hall stands in landscaped grounds on the North Yorkshire/Cleveland border. MTM said it is open to offers for the building; estate agents have yet to be instructed. Mr Ken Schofield, newly appointed chief executive, has said his main objective is to reduce total indebtedness - Pounds 106.7m in May - to Pounds 50m. The Hall, bought by MTM for some Pounds 250,000 in 1986 and restructured at a cost of Pounds 600,000, should fetch a seven figure price. The group plans to keep its headquarters functions in the north-east of England.</p>

			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / Lock-out threat dropped at Hyundai shipyard A CONFRONTATION at South Korea's Hyundai Heavy Industries, the world's largest shipyard, was averted at the weekend as the company dropped its threat to lock out 18,000 striking workers. Labour-management negotiations will resume on Friday after workers take their annual one-week summer holiday. The government had hoped to end the two-month long industrial dispute at Hyundai, South Korea's biggest conglomerate, by the end of July. The Hyundai strikes have been blamed for helping to plunge the current account into a Dollars 591m (Pounds 396.6m) deficit in June after it posted a Dollars 293m surplus in May. This was chiefly due to reduced motor vehicle exports resulting from a strike at Hyundai Motor. That dispute ended on July 23. HHI is the largest of four Hyundai subsidiaries still on strike. The union is seeking a pay increase above the 4.7 per cent rise offered by management and demanding the reinstatement of fired union leaders. The strike at HHI has cost the group Dollars 125m in lost sales. Workers at Hyundai Wood Industries are locked out, while a similar threat faces Hyundai Construction Equipment. The union at Hyundai Electrical Engineering rejected a proposed pay accord on Saturday.</p>

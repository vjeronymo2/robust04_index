			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / European Elections: Lib Dems downcast by tumbling share of vote Mr Paddy Ashdown and his senior colleagues were putting on a brave face for the cameras yesterday. But Liberal Democrats were privately downcast by their party's European election performance. Though it achieved an important breakthrough in sending its first MEPs to Strasbourg, the party's share of the vote, at slightly above 16 per cent, was more than one percentage point down on the last general election and more than 10 points down on the local elections last month. Its tally of two European seats - although in line with the target the party had set itself at the start of the campaign - was right at the bottom end of forecasters' projections. As the bronzed Liberal Democrat leader saw it, the results showed that the party had made 'steady progress' and had emerged as the clear challenger in the remaining Tory 'redoubt' in southern and south-west England. Britain was 'a rather Euro-sceptical nation', he acknowledged. This, plus the fact that large constituencies tend to discourage tactical voting, made European elections 'our most difficult hand to play'. Others were less sanguine about the outcome, albeit in private. One senior party worker described the result as 'terrible'. Another prominent figure said: 'Nationally, it was very disappointing.' Some activists spoke of their fears that the outcome could be bad enough to trigger fresh defections to Labour, after the example of Mr Alec Kellaway, the Liberal Democrat candidate in the Newham North East parliamentary by-election who sensationally rejoined Labour on the eve of last week's by-election. According to one activist, a former member of the Social Democratic party: 'The problem is that party officials who have come via the SDP from Labour into the Liberal Democrats are increasingly asking themselves why they are fighting a hopeless cause. 'The option of joining the SDP Mark-Two party in Tony Blair's new-model Labour party is becoming increasingly attractive.' Mr Ashdown publicly laughed off the notion that Mr Kellaway could turn out to be a trend-setter, rather than a maverick. But officials conceded in private that the threat of defections would hang over the party unless it could quickly prove that its bandwagon had not come to a halt. In an effort to keep the momentum going, several pre-planned mailshots will go out this week to constituency chairmen and other local activists in Liberal Democrat target seats in the south urging them to keep telling voters that Labour cannot win in their areas. 'We will be using these results in the south and south-west in our target seats to put the squeeze on Labour,' said Mr Matthew Taylor, the Liberal Democrat campaign co-ordinator.</p>

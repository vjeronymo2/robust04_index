Then  Pierce entered the game.  </P> <P> With 10 seconds left, Pierce threw an incompletion, but with two seconds left,  he connected with Gonzalez in the right corner of the end zone.  </P> <P> Westminster led, 10-7, at halftime. The Lions' Lucas Jones ran 13 yards for a  touchdown with 10:10 left in the second quarter, and Ken Scott kicked a 37-yard  field goal.  </P> <P> The Oilers scored on a 20-yard pass from Mike Chavira to Gabe Stupin.  </P> <P> Gabe Houston's one-yard run put Huntington Beach up, 14-10.  </P> <P> With 6:37 left, Vance Senteno ran for six yards to put Westminster back in  front, 16-14. The PAT failed after a bad snap.  </P> <P> Huntington Beach took the ensuing kickoff and kept the ball for almost five  minutes before Acocello's field goal. HEATHER SMALLEY  </P></p>

			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: British Gas rethinks Dollars 6bn investment in Kazakhstan British Gas is reconsidering its planned multi-billion dollar investment in Kazakhstan, according to industry officials. They say the Alma Ata government is now openly negotiating with Russia for joint development of its biggest natural gas and oil fields. British Gas says that negotiations are continuing. But executives have not hidden their frustration at the slow pace of talks over the past two years, since Kazakhstan awarded British Gas and Agip of Italy exclusive rights to negotiate a development agreement for the giant Karachaganak natural gas field. The main stumbling block is Russia's refusal to grant clear pipeline rights to transport Karachaganak gas through its territory. The western partners had planned to ship an eventual 20bn cubic metres a year to western markets in a Dollars 6bn project. Earlier this year, however, BG withdrew much of its heavy equipment from the site, and industry sources now say the company may withdraw altogether from the deal. The latest development follows increasingly heavy economic intervention across Central Asia and the Caucasus by different official Russian ministries and agencies. On one hand, Moscow officials have demanded percentage interests in large western energy deals in the southern ex-Soviet republics of Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, arguing that Russian engineers discovered and developed the fields before the 1991 Soviet collapse. At the same time, government agencies in Moscow have presented obstacles to the deals by nearly clamping shut Russia's pipeline system. A week ago, Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime minister, held talks with Kazakhstan prime minister Sergei Tereshchenko on joint development of both Karachaganak and Kazakhstan's huge Tengiz oilfield, according to Itar-Tass. Tengiz, to which the US oil company Chevron holds exclusive development rights, is the former Soviet Union's largest single oil project. But it too has become bogged down by talks about transit rights across Russia. Some analysts believe that Russia is employing economic pressure to boost the advantages of its own energy industries and to maintain political sovereignty over former Soviet republics. 'This is Russia asserting its dominance,' said a senior western diplomat in Tashkent, the Uzbekistan capital. 'Russia knows that if the oil starts flowing, Kazakhstan will get its political independence.' The Uralsk talks marked the first time that a senior Russian official openly discussed the desire for a piece of the two fields. Kazakhstan, which holds 50 per cent joint venture partnerships in Tengiz and Karachaganak, has very little cash, and has been seeking capital. The Kazakh government says it is now ready to auction off part of its interest in Tengiz, which has been included on a list of industrial enterprises to be sold in the near future.</p>

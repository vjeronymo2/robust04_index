The foreign minister told REUTER that it is in the interest  of all nations participating and interested in the Middle East  negotiations to ensure that incidents similar to the Hebron  massacre will never occur again.    Minister Musa said that Israel should abandon its current  policy concerning settlers and settlements. Israel should also  revise its security policy to provide protection for the 2  million Palestinians who live under occupation, for those  Palestinians are its responsibility, Musa pointed out.    The foreign minister said that Israel should abandon the  policy that Israeli Army forces refrain from confronting armed  settlers attacking Palestinians in the occupied territories. It  is in everyone's interest that negotiations resume, but only  once it is clear that measures, not yet taken, are in place to  protect the Palestinians and deal with the settlers and  settlements.    Minister Musa said that a UN Security Council resolution  calling for an international presence to protect the  Palestinians would not only pave the way for the resumption of  talks between the PLO and Israel, but also breath life into the  stalled Israeli-Syrian and Israeli-Jordanian talks.</p>

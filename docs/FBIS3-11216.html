[Begin recording] [Reporter Miriam Ortiz] The report says  the government has been unable to control military operations  and guarantee that such operations are carried out in accordance  with the law.    [Rueda] The government and the overseeing authorities  constantly strive to ensure that activities by all government  officials are performed in accordance with the law. [end  recording]    Pardo assures that whenever charges of torture and  kidnapping  are filed against any member of the Armed Forces, the first  people to respond are the commanders of those accused.    [Begin recording] [Ortiz] Are people being punished nowadays  when it is proved that such things have indeed occurred?    [Rueda] Yes, the law is being enforced. The regulations are  being enforced, and we are doing this by way of policy  guidelines that are solely designed to ensure that all members  of the public forces abide by the law. [end recording]</p>

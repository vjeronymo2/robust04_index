			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / UK Company News: City Centre 22% ahead despite recent slowdown Buoyant trading at City Centre Restaurants' main subsidiaries - Deep Pan Pizza and Garfunkels - helped the London-based catering group lift pre-tax profits by 22 per cent from Pounds 4.76m to Pounds 5.81m in first half to end-June. Although the improvement was flattered by a Pounds 561,000 gain on property activities, operating profits at the group's 173 restaurants rose from Pounds 4.45m to Pounds 4.84m on turnover ahead 7.5 per cent at Pounds 48.7m (Pounds 45.3m). Shares in the group, however, fell 2 1/2 p to 76p after it said trading had tailed off in the weeks running up to the period end. Mr James Naylor, chief executive, said diners had been deterred from eating out by the hot summer weather, the rail strikes and television coverage of the World Cup finals. 'Forty per cent of our outlets are in Greater London and they've been hit hard by the rail strikes,' he added. Some outlets had also been blighted by new traffic schemes which prevented customers parking nearby, and the group had decided to put eight sites on the market. Write-downs of Pounds 2.89m on those outlets were offset by a Pounds 3.45m gain on the sale and leaseback of its Leicester Square property, which should minimise the cash impact of the disposals on the company. Mr Naylor, meanwhile, said the group had opened six new restaurants in the first half and would have 14 new outlets by the year end. 'Our cash flow is strong enough to open 25 outlets a year and we could soon have more than 250,' he said. Such acquisitions are likely to be financed out of cashflow and bank reserves, which stood at Pounds 23.7m at the half year. Earnings per share rose by 7.7 per cent to 2.1p (1.68p), and the interim dividend is unchanged at 0.45p. COMMENT City Centre Restaurants is simmering gently. Its combination of Garfunkels, pizzerias and up-market Mexican outlets has proved an ideal recipe for growth, despite the recent slowdown in customer demand. There may not, however, be enough new sites available to satisfy the group's hunger for expansion - particularly at shopping malls, airports and cinema complexes. Nevertheless, the existing business is expected to report full-year profits of Pounds 14.2m, excluding the first half property gain. The shares - on a forward multiple of 15.8 - are at a 10 per cent premium to the market, but they probably represent fair value given the group's past performance.</p>

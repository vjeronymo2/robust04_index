			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] President Pascal Lissouba arrived in Paris this  evening for a two-day working visit. The Congolese president  will hold talks with French President Francois Mitterrand and  Cooperation Minister Michel Roussin.    Before his departure, President Lissouba was a guest of  "Africa Midday" progam, during which he took the opportunity to  give details on his political initiatives and also on the  setting up of a national union government which he says is a  difficult task:    [Begin Lissouba recording] I am willing to set up a union  government, but people are still in possession of weapons.  Imagine appointing someone who the representatives of the other  factions disagree with. What would that minister do? Do you  think he would be able to cross Bacongo, Diata, or other areas  safely? It is not an easy task.    I thought it would be possible and I tried to do it, but  from  the very start each member of government wanted a party  government and not a national union government. However, a  party government, which we experienced for about four to five  months, was a mess. No minister was answerable to the head of  government. I would summon some of them for a meeting, and they  would not come. They would first seek advice from the leader of  their party before answering to the invitation of the head of  state. And you call this a national union government? No, this  is not the case.    Those who are dreaming of a party government will have to  wait for a review of our Constitution, and we will do just that  when the time comes. Believe me, we still have a long way to  go. I come from the forest part of the country. I know that  the growth of a tree is a slow process, but that should not  prevent me from either felling that tree or immediately thinking  of replacing it. [end recording]</p>

			<p><P> August 12, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TENNIS SAN DIEGO TOURNAMENT;  </P> <P> THIS TIME, GRAF HOLDS OFF GARRISON FINISH, 6-4, 7-5, IN SEMIFINALS  </P> <P> The footsteps, once distant, are close enough to West Germany's Steffi Graf  that she knows she's being followed.  </P> <P> Now it's up to her to cover her tracks and keep the women chasing her No. 1  tennis ranking.  </P> <P> In the afternoon semifinal at the $225,000 Great American Bank tournament  Saturday, Graf proved why she's still the hunted. She beat Zina Garrison of  Houston, 6-4, 7-5, and advanced to today's 1 p.m. final at the San Diego Tennis  &amp; Racquet Club.  </P> <P> Graf will play fourth-seeded Manuela Maleeva of Switzerland, who defeated  sixth-seeded Barbara Paulus, 6-0, 4-6, 6-1, in the second semifinal.  </P> <P> Garrison defeated Graf most recently at Wimbledon, but this also was a rematch  of last year's San Diego final, which Graf won by the same score.  </P> <P> She was happier this time around.  </P> <P> "Last year, I wasn't playing very well," said Graf, who has a 6-2 record  against Garrison. "Today, I thought I was playing much better. I should have  put it away at 6-4, 2-0, but still, I'm very happy."  </P> <P> That Garrison was a player who had recently eliminated her from a Grand Slam  event was of little concern to Graf.  </P> <P> "I wasn't nervous today at all," Graf said. "My forehand's much better. I'm not  making many mistakes anymore. I'm much more relaxed."  </P> <P> Before a standing-room-only crowd, Graf lost a 2-0 lead in the second set and  found herself down, 4-2 and then 5-3. But Graf held serve, broke Garrison and  then held serve again to take a 6-5 lead.  </P> <P> Garrison's chances of forcing a tiebreaker dimmed after she double-faulted and  mis-hit a volley and then a groundstroke. They dissolved with Graf's  cross-court backhand winner that left Garrison flat on her feet at midcourt.  </P> <P> "I think I played well, but not as well as I could have," Garrison said. "I  missed some easy shots at the end of the match that normally I don't miss. But  Steffi kept the pressure on me."  </P> <P> Garrison fought the flu early in the week and said she almost had to withdraw  from the tournament, but she refused to make excuses.  </P> <P> "You can't blame it on that," she said. "I felt a little bit tired, but it was  hot out there and my legs were just a little rubbery."  </P> <P> Graf said Garrison has the type of game that troubles her, especially since  Garrison's backcourt game has improved.  </P> <P> "She's never an easy player to play against," Graf said. "It's the kind of game  that's hard to get into rhythm. Lately she's been playing well, and she's not  making the mistakes that she used to. She was shaky from the back, but she's  gotten a lot steadier."  </P> <P> With No. 2-ranked and second-seeded Martina Navratilova withdrawing Tuesday,  thus blowing the air out of a Graf-Navratilova showdown, there was speculation  that this match would be the real final.  </P> <P> Not so, Graf said.  </P> <P> "Tomorrow's the last match," she said. "I knew this would be a hard match, but  it's the same for the finals. Whoever gets in the final has a high level, too."  </P> <P> Graf celebrates her three-year anniversary as the world's No. 1 player Aug. 16,  and she said it is sometimes a hard role to live with.  </P> <P> "I'm surprised by the No. 1 ranking for three years," she said. "I came in at  18 years (old). I didn't expect to be there at that age, and not for that  consistent time.  </P> <P> "It's not easy. It's not the tennis itself. It's the life around me that makes  it not the easiest and sometimes not the most enjoyable. But whenever I'm back  on the court, I enjoy it."  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 6, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KID BEAT: SHARON, LOIS AND BRAM: FUN FOR ALL  </P> <P> Young kids love Sharon, Lois and Bram. The Canadian trio was a big hit at the  Wiltern Theatre Sunday, and the festivities continue at the Orange County  Performing Arts Center tonight .  </P> <P> But enough about the kids. What about the parents who have to pay for and sit  through the concerts?  </P> <P> No problem. Sharon, Lois and Bram are fun for the grown-ups too.  </P> <P> In concert, the trio -- perhaps best known as the stars of "The Elephant Show"  on cable TV's Nickelodeon -- offers the contrasts that simply come from being a  trio, as opposed to the male solo acts that dominate the major leagues of the  children's concert circuit. This group doesn't just sing, it harmonizes.  </P> <P> Bram's low-key wit keeps the parents amused. Sharon and Lois are perky but  never precious. And if the women begin to seem interchangeable, they've  eliminated the confusion in concert by wearing sweaters bearing their initials  -- and explaining that short-haired Sharon's initial also stands for "short"  and long-haired Lois' initial also stands for "long," while bald and bearded  Bram's initial also stands for . . . "beard."  </P> <P> Details like this mean a lot in a children's concert.  </P> <P> The musical arrangements in concert are not quite as rich and sophisticated as  on the group's recordings, but the five-piece band is composed of pros, and the  variety of musical sources remains admirably eclectic.  </P> <P> The group gets the audience moving without putting any particular child on the  spot, and they insert a plug for UNICEF as well as one for their TV show. While  the kids in the back may not be able to see what's happening very well, those  farther up in the hall will get a kick out of seeing these charming electronic  images spring to life.  </P> <P>  At Orange County Performing Arts Center, Costa Mesa, tonight at 7. Tickets:  $8-11; (714) 740-2000 or (213) 480-3232.  </P> <P> </P></p>

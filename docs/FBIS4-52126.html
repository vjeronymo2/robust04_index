			<p>BFN     [Text] Russia has asked Itochu Corporation, a major  Japanese trading firm, and JAMCO, a Japanese aircraft parts  manufacturer, to use their interior-design technology and funds  to participate in the development of a high-tech jumbo jet  airliner [the Ilyushin-96M, capable of carrying 386 passengers].  This was disclosed on 3 May by a Russian official in charge of  the development project. Negotiations have continued between  Russia and the Japanese firms for nearly a year through the  mediation of a major U.S. aircraft manufacturer. There is a  possibility the Japanese firms will make major moves toward  participating in the development project once the prospect of  raising funds is opened and Russia's plans for the repayment of  their investments are confirmed.    Russia hopes the Japanese firms will provide full  technological assistance in designing the passenger cabin of the  Ilyushin-96M and in manufacturing aircraft parts. Major points  of the proposals made by Russia during the negotiations are: 1)  The passenger cabin is jointly designed; 2) the Japanese firms  manufacture kitchen and toilet facilities; 3) Russian  participants manufacture ceiling and ceiling storage cabins; and  4) the passenger cabin (measuring 15 meters in length) prototype  is displayed at the Paris Air Show scheduled for June this year  if it is ready in time.    With regard to the funds, Russia has asked the Japanese  firms  to provide approximately $3 million as the initial cost of the  development project. So far, Russia has asked them to invest  $25 million in the development project, but it is said to have  cut the amount by one-eighth in an attempt to lure the Japanese  firms into the project.</p>

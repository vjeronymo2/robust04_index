			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / Greek unease at 'empire' reborn MENTION Macedonia to a Greek official and his expression becomes stern. Strong words follow about how the breakaway Yugoslav republic should choose a new name, like 'Slavomacedonia' or 'Western Macedonia', in order to avoid offending Greek sensibilities. Nationalist fervour is sweeping Greece with an intensity that seems out of place in a European Community member-state which claims to be an enthusiastic supporter of European union. Left and right sound equally passionate. A former socialist minister declared: 'We must make clear their use of the Greek name Macedonia amounts to a casus belli for our country.' Last week, deposed King Constantine, who lives in Britain, hinted in a television interview that Greece should not rule out acquiring a piece of the Macedonian republic by force. The ruling conservatives stop short of making inflammatory remarks in public. Still, they were held responsible for an unexpected ban last month on a press conference to present a report on ethnic minorities in Greece - among them the 40,000 Slavomacedonians who live close to the border with Macedonia. 'The country has been seized with hysteria over the Macedonian issue. It's unfortunate because the Greek position can only lead to isolation,' says Professor Nikiforos Diamandouros, a political scientist at Athens University and a member of an Athens human rights group which organised the press conference. The Greek argument is that the name Macedonia, chosen by Tito when he carved the republic out of Serbia in 1944, implies a territorial claim on the Greek province of Macedonia. According to Mr Antonis Samaras, the Greek foreign minister, Greece will not recognise the republic unless it changes its name, and gives guarantees it has no territorial ambitions and will refrain from propaganda attacks against Greek interests. So far only Bulgaria and Turkey have recognised Macedonia, but other European countries are expected to do so before much longer. Popular resentment over Macedonia reflects a deep-seated feeling among Greeks that their Slavic neighbours have usurped a heritage associated with Alexander the Great, the Macedonian king whose conquests 2,300 years ago established Greek dynasties as far away as Persia and Afghanistan. However, Greek bankers and businessmen are becoming increasingly annoyed with the furore over Macedonia. About 100 Greek companies are involved in joint ventures there, mostly producing clothing for export. Owners are worried that their cross-border investments may collapse if a compromise is not found soon.</p>

Testifying before the U.S. Senate Information Committee  meeting on 25 January, CIA Director Woolsey said that the United  States has sent and begun operations for a U.S. national  intelligence support team on the Korean peninsula. The NEW YORK  TIMES then reported that the United States will deploy Patriot  missiles, commonly known as the "missile-killing missile," for  the U.S. Forces in the ROK.    These moves are surfacing at a time when the U.S. Congress,  which began its new session on 25 January, deliberates over a  new U.S. defense policy toward the ROK, including further  withdrawal of U.S. ground forces. These moves particularly draw  our attention because they show that the U.S. defense policy is  taking into account North Korea's nuclear issue which is  expected to be resolved sometime early this year.    In accordance with the so-called "Bottom-up" plan of  comprehensively reviewing post Cold-War U.S. defense policy, the  U.S. Forces in the ROK submitted a report to the Department of  Defense in November last year meticulously analyzing their  defense capabilities, problems, and complementary measures. In  the report, the U.S. Forces in the ROK noted a problem in the  combat deployment of reinforcements from the U.S. mainland in  the event of war on the Korean peninsula, and stressed a need  for supplementary measures to cut off the enemy's spearhead of  attack.    Therefore, the strengthening of intelligence capabilities of  the U.S. Forces in the ROK and the request for the deployment of  Patriot missiles must have some bearing on this operational  review. In particular, in the event of punitive military action  against the North with North Korea's continued rejection of  nuclear inspections, the Patriot missiles will be a unique  military countermeasure to North Korea's Nodong-1 and Nodong-2  missiles. Even if the United States does not wage a direct  military attack on North Korea, the presence of Patriot missiles  can serve as a strong message on U.S. resolve to settle the  North Korean nuclear issue.    However, whether the deployment of the Patriot missiles can  effect the success the United States desires is doubtful. The  Patriot missiles were deployed for an actual war in 1984. Since  they were first put to use in an actual war during the Gulf war,  much has been said about their efficiency. While some evaluated  the Patriot missile positively as a "ghost-catching missile,"  many people have pointed out that the Patriot missile's  target-hitting accuracy is only about ten percent and that there  are many problems in removing shell fragments.    Whether the deployment of the Patriot missiles is suitable  for the Korean peninsula's ground configuration should be  reviewed. Some military experts hold that due to the lack of  battlefield depth with Seoul less than 40 km away from the  Armistice Line, the efficiency of the Patriot missile's air  interception rate will not reach that of the Gulf war.    U.S. intentions on enforcing the deployment of Patriot  missiles in the ROK is somewhat doubtful as the deployment of  Patriot missiles can aggravate tension between North and South  Korea at a time when U.S.-North Korea nuclear negotiations are  nearing conclusion and nuclear negotiations between the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and North Korea are in  progress. Furthermore, some point out that the deployment of  Patriot missiles may be part of a "sophisticated sale strategy"  of the Clinton administration aimed at handing over the Patriot  missiles to the ROK Army following their deployment in the ROK  by U.S. Forces. This claim by military experts is not entirely  groundless when considering the Patriot missile system's price  of $150 billion (120 billion won) and their narrow foreign  market.    Apparently, the inauguration of a U.S. national intelligence  support team in the ROK derives from the U.S. policy to augment  the intelligence-gathering capacity of U.S. Forces in the ROK as  well as from their assessment that North Korea's nuclear issue  is more serious than previously thought. In a testimony to  Congress, Director Woolsey said that North Korea possesses  enough plutonium to produce at least one nuclear bomb and that  it has acquired the technology to load nuclear bombs on MiG-23  planes. This warrants the collection and analysis of more  accurate and precise intelligence on the suspicion of North  Korea's nuclear development.    In particular, the importance of appraising and analyzing  intelligence on the Korean peninsula is more actually felt when  considering the fact that U.S. aerial photographs provided the  intelligence on North Korea's two unreported nuclear facilities  which caused North Korea to withdraw from the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty.</p>

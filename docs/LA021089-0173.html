			<p><P> February 10, 1989, Friday, Late Final Edition  </P> <P> DEMOCRATS ELECT FIRST BLACK CHAIRMAN  </P> <P> Ron Brown was elected the first black chairman of the Democratic National  Committee today, and the former aide to Jesse Jackson promptly urged his party  to unite behind its traditional values.  </P> <P> "Only a few months ago, our friends in the press said this contest would leave  us divided and shattered," Brown told hundreds of committee colleagues who  elected him by acclamation at a downtown hotel. "Instead, we stand here today  shoulder to shoulder and arm to arm.  </P> <P> "There is no need to dwell on, but we cannot ignore, the history of this  moment," he acknowledged. "In choosing the first American of African descent to  lead one of America's major political parties, you have made history."  </P> <P> Nevertheless, he insisted, the election does not signal a rejection of the  party's more centrist elements and does not mean that the chairman is tied down  to the most liberal Jackson faction.  </P> <P> "I accept this responsibility beholden to no individual, afraid of no faction,  and pledged to no institution except the Democratic Party and our members," the  47-year-old lawyer assured his audience.  </P> <P> Brown, who served as deputy chairman from 1982 to 1985, was assured of the top  spot last month when four other men dropped out of what had been foreseen as a  bitter battle to succeed retiring Chairman Paul G. Kirk.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 29, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> KAREEM GETS $500 FINE FOR SHOVING FAN  </P> <P> Laker center Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, found guilty last month of two misdemeanor  charges stemming from an incident with an Italian tourist at a shopping mall  last April, was fined $500 this morning in Phoenix Municipal Court and ordered  to pay $840 in restitution.  </P> <P> Abdul-Jabbar, flanked by his attorneys and receiving a police escort into court  and to a waiting limousine, waived his right to appeal and spent only six  minutes in court before leaving without speaking to a dozen reporters in a  packed courtroom.  </P> <P> Judge John L. Wiehn fined Abdul-Jabbar for shoving a camera in the face of  Fernando Nicolia, a tourist from Italy who was taping the Laker center with a  home video camera at the Metrocenter shopping mall in north Phoenix on April  21, 1988. Nicolia said he suffered a bruised eye and a scratched ear from the  force of the shove from the 7-foot-2, 267-pound Abdul-Jabbar.  </P> <P> The Phoenix prosecutor told the judge that Abdul-Jabbar's actions against the  5-foot-9 fan was "like a mismatch in basketball."  </P> <P> The prosecution's contention was that the incident involving Abdul-Jabbar was  an intentional action, not a reflexive one, as the defense had claimed.  </P> <P> During the proceeding, Abdul-Jabbar was called before the bench and answered  Wiehn's questions mostly with one-word responses.  </P> <P> The maximum sentence that could have been imposed was 10 months in jail and a  $5,000 fine.  </P> <P> A civil suit filed by Nicolia is pending although attorneys for Abdul-Jabbar  are trying to settle out of court.  </P> <P> Leonard Armato, Abdul-Jabbar's attorney, said he and his client were happy that  the case has been concluded but were upset that it came to trial.  </P></p>

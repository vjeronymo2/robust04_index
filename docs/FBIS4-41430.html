			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister of Kazakhstan Sergey Tereshchenko  believes that Kazakhstan cannot return to the ruble zone due to  serious economic differences between Russia and Kazakhstan.    He told parliament on Thursday [23 June] that it would be  beneficial to introduce a supra-national CIS currency -- the  altyn.    He said that the idea of introducing the altyn had been  proposed by President Nazarbayev and that Kazakhstan's  withdrawal from the ruble zone and the introduction of its  national currency was a forced measure, taken after Russia  demanded about $1.5 billion from Kazakhstan.    He said that a single economic system must be created, and  customs limitations lifted in the CIS, all of which will promote  the integration of the CIS countries.</p>

			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / International Company News: GM sells Allison division to specialist buy-out team GENERAL MOTORS, the US automotive group, is to sell its Allison Gas Turbine division to an investor group led by Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice, the leveraged buy-out specialists. Allison makes engines for the aerospace, industrial and marine markets. The two sides declined to disclose the value of the deal, but Wall Street analysts estimated it would be worth around Dollars 300m. The disposal is the latest in a series by GM designed to concentrate its energies on improving its lossmaking North American automotive operations. Other divestments over the past year include its Allison transmission division, which was sold to ZF Friedrichshafen of Germany. Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice, which manages an equity capital pool of more than Dollars 1bn, is one of the more prominent US buy-out investors. Its deals include the Dollars 1.6bn 1991 buy-out of the computer printers group Lexmark International from International Business Machines. GM announced in April last year it was putting Allison up for sale. Mr Joseph Rice, president of Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice, said yesterday the firm had been negotiating with GM for nearly two years. However, he said: 'For some period of time GM had not really made up its mind that it wanted to sell this business.' Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice will be investing around Dollars 100m of equity in the business. Allison's managers are expected to buy between 15 per cent and 20 per cent of company's common stock. The management investment team will be led by Mr Blake Wallace, general manager of the division since 1983, who will become president and chief executive of the independent company, to be called Allison Engine. Allison, which became a division of GM in 1929, had 1992 sales of around Dollars 700m. It is profitable, though GM and Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice declined to put a figure on this. Its most important business is making engines for the aircraft industry. It has been a supplier for the C-130 military transport since the start of that programme, and also supplies civilian and military helicopters. Mr Rice said it had important new products in the pipeline, and saw particular opportunities in the market for so-called feeder airlines, which run services into the hubs run by the leading American carriers. Although the number of leveraged buy-outs has diminished greatly since their peak in the 1980s, there has been a steady stream of medium-sized deals in the US over the past two years. Some Wall Street analysts are forecasting a substantial increase in activity.</p>

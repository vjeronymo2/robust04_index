			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Finnish coalition in favour of joining EC FINLAND'S centre-right coalition government last night voted in favour of applying to join the European Community. The Finnish parliament debates the proposal next month is expected to approve making a formal membership application on March 18. A majority of ministers voted in favour of EC membership despite tensions within the ruling Centre Party over the effect on Finnish agriculture. The Centre Party traditionally has represented the interests of farmers, many of whom fear that EC membership would mean cuts in generous state subsidies. The government warned last night that Finnish agriculture would have to become more competitive. Finland, a member of the European Free Trade Association (Efta), hopes to join Sweden and Austria in parallel entry negotiations. A report commissioned by parliament predicted that EC membership would boost economic growth, create 100,000 jobs over the next 10 years and lead to cuts in taxes and consumer prices. A recent opinion poll showed that 51 per cent of Finns favour EC membership while 40 per cent are against it. The opposition Social Democrat Party is in favour of EC membership. President Mauno Koivisto, who has constitutional responsibility for foreign policy, backed EC membership in a speech earlier this month.</p>

We are here at the office of  General Antonio Riviello Bazan, secretary of national defense,  who has kindly approved of this interview with the Mexican news  agency NOTIMEX. Good day, General.    [Riviello] Good day.    [Alvarez] Sir, the talks for peace and reconciliation began  today in San Cristobal de las Casas, Chiapas. What is the  opinion of the Mexican Army and the secretary of national  defense regarding this round of negotiations?    [Riviello] In the first place, I would like to tell you that  I thank you for your presence here at the National Defense  Secretariat, which allows us to convey our views to Mexican  society.    I would tell you that the members of the Army and Air Force  support the decision of the government of the republic to  continue the path of political solutions over armed  confrontation. We believe this is the most appropriate way to  attain peace and reconciliation in the Chiapas highlands.    [Alvarez] What are the measures that the Army will adopt  regarding the troops based in the area, particularly those in  the area of conflict?    [Riviello] As we have said on various occasions, since the  day the president of the republic decreed the cease-fire, the  troops returned to their garrisons in order to preserve the  security of the towns. Since then, the troops have avoided all  operating movements [movimientos operativos] that could  interfere with peace negotiations.    [Alvarez] Will the conflict in Chiapas have an effect on the  Mexican Army? Will it affect the Army's organization, training,  or reconnaissance of potential conflict areas, for instance?    [Riviello] Our legislation is very clear in that regard. The  Basic Law of the Army and Air Force establishes that to fulfill  their missions these services must organize, train, and equip  themselves with the requirements demanded by their missions. We  have not stopped fulfilling these ordinances.    However, these circumstances have given us the opportunity  to  assess our deployment and concentration capacity and, of course,  to train our ground and air troops [one-second break in  reception] Regarding the areas of potential conflict, I can tell  you and our compatriots that the security missions encompass not  only Chiapas but all the national territory.    [Alvarez] Gen. Riviello, without a doubt, the Mexican Army  has contributed since the beginning to create conditions for the  political dialogue in Chiapas. Do you believe that the media  have objectively reported the actions of the National Defense  Secretariat?    [Riviello] Since the beginning of the conflict, the National  Defense Secretariat has issued several communiques explaining in  a specific and honest manner the information available to the  public. Now, regarding the media's handling of that information,  I can tell you that their reporting has been very accurate.  However, they have carried out their duty from different  perspectives and according to their opinions.    [Alvarez] General, Gen. Absalon Castellanos was finally  released after 45 days of being held captive. Do you think that  the release of Gen. Castellanos is a good start for the dialogue  on peace and reconciliation?    [Riviello] I think that this event represents a step  forward.  [words indistinct] Castellanos had been held illegally. His  release reduces the existing tension and improves the  possibilities of solution through dialogue, which has been the  offer of the government of the republic.    [Alvarez] If you had to summarize, how would you evaluate  of the Mexican Army's performance during the Chiapas conflict?    [Riviello] I believe I addressed that in a previous  question. I would like to add that the Army and Air Force  prepare and train continuously to be ready to accomplish their  missions. These missions include guaranteeing internal order,  to which they responded efficiently to reestablish peace and  guarantee the security of the inhabitants in strict compliance  with the law.    [Alvarez] Allow me to ask a somewhat elaborate question now.  Following the Chiapas conflict, have you considered the  possibility of reinforcing our country's borders militarily?  Perhaps not because of the continued speculation about foreign  participation in the conflict, but because the enormous amount  of information has shown that our southern border is highly  vulnerable.    [Riviello] As the public knows, the relations Mexico has  with its bordering neighbors are of total respect and sincere  cordiality. The borders are in fact quite vulnerable, given  their geographic characteristics and their length. To reinforce  them militarily requires an enormous economic and human effort,  which cannot really be justified by the purpose. I would like  to remind you that we have always had personnel stationed along  the southern border to aid in the fight against drug trafficking  and ensure national security.    [Alvarez] General, has the Chiapas conflict had any kind of  political effect within the Mexican Army?    [Riviello] I would say that it has allowed us to reaffirm  our commitment and loyalty by placing the fulfillment of our  specific duties above our personal interests for the benefit of  social peace. This implies the commitment Mexican soldiers have  to serve Mexico.    [Alvarez] Finally, General Riviello, do you believe certain  human rights organizations have politicized the issue or lost  their objectiveness?    [Riviello] Allow me to say that these organizations are of  great importance to society and therefore deserve our respect,  especially those which carry out their duty objectively. Now,  regarding the possibility that some have politicized their work,  I would say that they would be making a serious mistake if they  were to trade such a noble goal for some sort of political  interest.</p>

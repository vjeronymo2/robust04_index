			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Mercury agrees to recognition talks with union Mercury, the main telecoms rival to British Telecommunications, has agreed to a formal meeting with leaders of the National Communications Union to discuss recognition of the NCU in the wake of threats by unions to block its expansion abroad. Union officials say that the international business of Mercury's parent, Cable and Wireless, seems to be suffering from an 'anti-union' image. A joint venture with Telecom Eireann is threatened because of Irish union objections, and the Belgian telecommunications union was influential in preventing C&amp;W winning business in Belgium last year. C&amp;W could face similar problems in South Africa and in northern European countries with strong social partnership traditions. Mercury is unlikely to concede anything to the NCU in the short-term - it has always maintained that it is not anti-union, but opposes collective bargaining. Some officials say that, given the international pressure, Mercury may be interested in a hybrid status for the union, which would still exclude the union from collective bargaining but give it some formal representational role. They also point to the fact that Bell Canada, which recognises unions, now owns about 20 per cent of the company. The NCU has about 900 members among the 10,500 staff, partly the result of a recruitment campaign in the past two years. The union has been allowed access to staff on some occasions and has represented members in unfair dismissal and equal opportunity cases. Its representatives have not been subject to company pressure. The immediate reason for the meeting appears to be an article in the December issue of Messenger, the Mercury staff journal, which was critical of the NCU recruitment campaign and said that in the 10 years of Mercury's existence it had received no request for recognition from the NCU. The NCU responded with a letter to Mr Robert Johnston, Mercury's personnel director, disputing the article and requesting a formal meeting to table a recognition claim. The meeting will take place on April 26. Mr Tony Young, the NCU general secretary, said: 'I hope we can have a constructive and positive meeting but we will be making it clear that the NCU are here to stay in Mercury, as evidenced by our establishing three new NCU-Mercury organisations this month.'</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Anna Kachkayeva under the rubric "Recurrence": </F> "TV Is Still Outside the Law. Could This Be for the Better?"]    [Text] Last week, the Union of Journalists of Russia, the  Glasnost Defense Fund, and the Committee in Defense of Freedom  of Speech and Rights of Journalists held hearings on the draft  Regulations on the Federal Service for Television and Radio  Broadcasting of Russia. The Federal Service, which was  established by an edict of the president in December 1993,  became the successor of the Ministry of the Press and the  Federal Information Center. As the regulations show, it did not  just inherit but also multiplied the functions of the two  predecessor organizations. The text betrays a certain nostalgic  desire to recreate some kind of Ministry of Propaganda.    As the anonymous authors think, the new agitation and  propaganda arm will not just control, verify, and issue and  revoke licenses but also monitor off-budget funding for TV and  radio companies and analyze the content of audio and visual  materials, which may be interpreted as the introduction of  censorship.    The duties of the chairman are as specific as can be: The  chairman of the Federal Service may directly influence the  information policy of the state because he is granted the  absolute right to appoint and dismiss the heads of all-Russian  state broadcasting and regional TV and radio companies, as well  as approve regulations on territorial TV and radio broadcasting  services.    This cannot fail to remind us of the rigid pyramid of the  State Committee for Television and Radio Broadcasting with its  local committees still before the federal era!    The new centralized organ is ready to extend its influence  to  independent TV and radio companies. As Igor Malashenko, general  director of the NTV [Independent Television] independent TV  company, put it, only the right to mint its own coins is not set  forth in this "delirious" text.    As is usually the case, such documents see the light of day  under quite mysterious circumstances. The text of the  regulations was discussed with bewilderment at a conference of  chiefs of regional TV and radio companies; thereafter, it  accidentally ended up in the committee for defending the rights  and freedoms of journalists. It came out at the hearings that  the authors of the regulations have not been found. The  preparers did not wish to show up at the discussion of their own  creation, either. So, it is still unclear who penned the  document.    The management of the Federal Service has stated that it has  nothing to do with this opus. According to Kirill Ignatyev,  chairman of the Subcommittee for Television and Radio  Broadcasting of the parliamentary Information Committee,  Aleksandr Yakovlev said in a conversation with him that the  draft regulations are actually the "typist's version."  Apparently, the "typist" is the proverbial "fall guy" with whom  Russians are so familiar.    Representatives of the parliamentary committee, the court  chamber for information disputes, state and nonstate TV and  radio broadcasting companies from Moscow and the regions,  experts, and journalists were of the same mind: The document  contradicts existing legislation and broadcasting practices to  such a degree and, in essence, violates the right to freedom of  information that serious discussion of it is out of the question.    However, the opinion on the regulations expressed at the  hearings is, after all, emotional in nature, it is called upon  to put the authorities on notice about what the community of  journalists thinks. It does not at all mean that the Regulations  on the Federal Service, which are "making the rounds" of Kremlin  offices and, according to some information, collecting  endorsements, will not become official. Their circulation may be  a trial balloon floated in order to determine the attitude  toward the maximum program, some details of which may later be  abandoned.    Therefore, it is premature to close the discussion, all the  more so because participants in the hearing familiarized  themselves with the draft of a new edict of the president,  according to which the Federal Service should be abolished,  along with the Committee for the Press. It is planned that a new  Federal Information Service of Russia will be established  instead of them which will coordinate the activities of  newspapers, television, radio, information agencies, and  publishing houses. If the draft edict is to be believed, it will  be headed by the already mentioned Aleksandr Yakovlev.    P.S. Early last week quite a number of other documents  associated with television and radio were discussed at the  Russian-American Information Press Center: the draft laws on  television and radio broadcasting, on federal communications, on  state protectionist measures with regard to the mass media, and  on procedures for coverage of the activities of organs of state  power by state-owned mass media. All of them drew many  bewildered questions from those in attendance. To be sure,  lawyers who were conducting this meeting "reassured" the  audience: The Law on Television and Radio Broadcasting (as well  as other legislative acts) will hardly be passed by the current  membership of the State Duma. Apparently, television will have  to exist, just as before, outside of the law. Who knows--it  might be for the better, especially if we take into account the  imperfection--to put it mildly--of most documents submitted to  the public for judgment.</p>

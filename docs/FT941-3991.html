			<p>940314 FT  14 MAR 94 / Fears prompt price curbs China, fearful of unrest caused by sharp increases in the cost of living, has taken a step back from its price reforms by authorising price controls on 20 basic items, writes Tony Walker in Beijing. The official Economic Daily yesterday published a State Council (cabinet) decree en-abling local authorities to 'make appropriate interference' in the market. Items covered include wheat flour, rice, edible oil, coal and fees for schools and hospitals. China had claimed it had deregulated markets for all but a handful of staple items. The cabinet decision reflects concern over the risks posed to public order by sharp rises in the cost of living. Inflation in China's 35 largest cities reached 23.3 per cent in January compared with the same month last year. China has vowed to bring inflation below 10 per cent over the next year or so but is having difficulty calming an over-heating economy that grew by more than 13 per cent last year.</p>

			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / 'Dianagate' phone line condemned THE PHONELINE service which played a tape of an intimate conversation, allegedly between the Princess of Wales and Mr James Gilbey, was yesterday condemned as 'an unreasonable invasion of privacy'. ICSTIS, the watchdog on premium-rate telephone services, censured The Sun newspaper for arranging for the 23-minute tape to be played to callers who paid up to 48p a minute to hear it. It banned The Sun's use of numbers with the prefix 0898 for the tape. The Sun today refuses to scrap the scheme, and says it has moved it to a line outside the responsibility of ICSTIS.</p>

			<p><P> March 30, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> O'KEEFFE SHOW HAS GEORGIA ON ITS MIND  </P> <P> "I think we're a hit!" declared Ilene Susan Fort, associate curator of American  Art at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.  </P> <P> She was referring to the impressive opening-night turnout for the Georgia  O'Keeffe exhibition Tuesday, which drew about 2,000 O'Keeffe admirers into the  Hammer galleries for the only West Coast showing of her work.  </P> <P> Guests dressed in warm black tie and furs to brave the elements as they  wandered through the open courtyard for the buffet dinner reception. The  galleries were crowded early on, affirming O'Keeffe's enduring popularity and  Los Angeles' current fascination with things Southwestern.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Southwestern Look  </P> <P> Art patrons gazed upon the 35 oil paintings, watercolors, pastels and charcoals  of still lifes, landscapes, flowers and abstractions. Some were even fascinated  with the three black-and-white photographs of O'Keeffe that adorned the wall at  the beginning of the exhibition.  </P> <P> "We did the show in keeping with what O'Keeffe would have wanted," Fort  explained. "For instance, the walls are not very strongly colored."  </P> <P> Even the natural colors of the moldings and ropes designed to keep viewers a  few inches away from the wall were in keeping with the Southwestern feel.  </P> <P> That wasn't the only theme touch. The outside of the museum was bathed in a  pinkish light and the cuisine was definitely Southwestern: ancho chile  quesadillas, shrimp tamales, Indian corn pudding, fritters and bunuelo cups  filled with pumpkin mousse and caramel apples.  </P> <P> It was also a family event of sorts. O'Keeffe's niece, June O'Keeffe Sebring,  attended the opening along with her children, Tom Sebring, Crina Bigelow and  Karen Sexton.  </P> <P> "It's so interesting to see the same paintings in a different gallery," said  O'Keeffe Sebring, who had seen the show on tour at other galleries. "I find a  different favorite that seems to speak to me.  </P> <P> "One thing my aunt didn't want was for people to analyze her paintings," she  continued. "She just wanted people to enjoy them. She was sharing her  experience with someone else."  </P> <P> Sexton said this was her first time seeing the works. "The thing that struck me  most," she said after emerging from the galleries, "is how much of her  personality was in it, the kind of emotions that come out of it, why she picked  one particular part of a flower. These were the things she loved, and that's  why she took the time to paint them and emphasize them."  </P> <P> Seen milling through the courtyard and galleries were Oliver Stone, Eva Marie  Saint and Jeffrey Hayden, museum director Earl A. Powell III and wife, Nancy;  board of trustees Chairman Julian Ganz Jr. and wife, Jo Ann; Southwestern Bell  Corp. CEO Zane E. Barnes, O'Keeffe estate representative Juan Hamilton, Eddie  Albert, board of trustees President Daniel Belin and wife, Daisy; Dona and  Dwight Kendall, Keith and Bill Kieschnick, Sheila and Walter Weisman and Anita  and Julius Zelman.  </P></p>

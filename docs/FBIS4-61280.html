			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Boris Glebov: "Will The Russian-American </F> Exercises Take Place?"]    [Excerpt] Judging by the latest, very confidential  information (from President Yeltsin's entourage), the  Russian-American exercises planned this July for the command  staffs of the two countries' peacemaking forces will not take  place. The reasons given vary greatly: From the negative  stance of certain State Duma deputies to foreign policy reasons  -- the recent bombardment of Bosnian Serb positions by NATO  aircraft. The latter reason is clearly the most important,  after all, what were the Russian and U.S. servicemen intending  to rehearse at the Totskiy military training area. The joint  bombing of Serbs? But since the diplomats are not agreed on our  countries' approaches to peacemaking in Bosnia, the military  have nothing to coordinate at the exercises.    Although, in fact, there was nothing sinister about the  "deceased" Russian-American exercises: No more than 250  servicemen were to have participated on either side. Servicemen  from the 27th Motorized Rifle Division were to have been  Russia's representatives (the division is registered in that  capacity at the United Nations and is actually billeted in  Totsk). The units of the Russian peacemaking forces in the  Dniester region, North Ossetia, and so on are formed from this  division's units. The plan was for servicemen from the U.S. 3d  Infantry Division to represent the U.S. Army at the exercises  (it is stationed in West Germany and is the backbone of the U.S.  peacemaking force in Europe). There would not have been any  armored formations at the exercises since the main purpose of  them was to elaborate common approaches to the planning and  conduct of peacemaking actions connected with operations to  maintain peace in trouble spots. The only military hardware the  Americans were planning to take to Russia was 50 jeeps and 10 or  so trucks to transport people and baggage.    The actual command staff exercises were intended to be held  6-14 July 1994 at the Totsk training area, the very place where  tests of the first Soviet atom bomb were carried out in 1953.  Do U.S. defenders of the environment know about this? After  all, the dashing U.S. soldiers nearly marched onto radioactive  soil. Is it not a danger to their priceless health? I won't  ask about the danger to Russian servicemen's health -- a futile  question. But let us get back to our exercises.    Apparently, these maneuvers will indeed not take place in  Russia in the immediate future, despite the fact that the  Americans had been through all the details of their stay in  Totsk. The latest visit by the U.S. delegation led by U.S.  Colonel Deyton Kit [name as transliterated] was 18-22 April  1994. The Americans were intending to bring everything with  them (perhaps including drinking water and toilet paper). For  the hire of barracks and Russian equipment and communications  facilities the U.S. side was expecting to pay the Russian  Defense Ministry $2 million! But, alas, we will not be seeing  any of this money now, it will stay in the United States.    In fact, initially the intention was to conduct the joint  exercises in the United States, but, obviously, the Russian side  could not find the $2 million to transport baggage and  personnel. Then the Russian side suggested Duisburg (Germany) as  the venue for the joint exercises. But the German leadership  was not enthusiastic about Moscow's initiative, so the  interested sides decided on Totsk as the venue for the joint  exercises, since this would cost the Russian side practically  nothing in hard currency.    But, as it happens, the price was a quiet scandal in  parliament, demands from the stubborn opposition, and, as a  result, no joint exercises on Russian territory. It is not  worth the trouble, as they say. [passage omitted]</p>

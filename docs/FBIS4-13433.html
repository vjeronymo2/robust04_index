			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by News Research and Commentaries Group] </F>   [Text] In the most recent martyrdom-seeking attempt in  occupied Palestine, yesterday a Palestinian mujahid in Jerusalem  attacked a group of Zionists with an ax and seriously wounded  four of them. Along with this attack, Islamic Resistance  Movement--Hamas--stated that if the Zionist regime promises to  completely halt the massacre of Palestinian civilians, the  movement will review its attacks on the Zionist regime's  civilian targets.    Political observers believe that until recently, the Zionist  regime acted unilaterally in massacring the oppressed  Palestinians. However, since the time the Islamic Resistance  Movement acquired more strength in organizing retaliatory  attacks and proved this strength, the heads of the Zionist  regime realized that vulnerability is mutual and that the  intensification of state terrorism in the occupied territories  will engulf the usurping Zionist regime as well.    Under such conditions, the proposal by Hamas to completely  halt attacks on civilians is opportune and conveys a significant  message. Until now the Zionist regime has been able to render  several million Palestinians homeless in the land of their  forefathers by resorting to direct military and terrorist  methods and indirect political-economic pressures; and if the  Zionist regime abandons this behavior under the pressure of the  crushing blows by the Palestinian martyr-seekers, the Islamic  movement in Palestine will have achieved something that Israel  has never surrendered to since the outset of its usurping  presence. But if the Zionist regime opposes this proposal--and  it is more probable that it will--then the aggressive nature of  this terrorist regime will be further revealed to those whose  hearts are bent on making peace with it.</p>

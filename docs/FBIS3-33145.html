			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 17 Feb (AFP) -- Five thousand  Colombian oil industry workers stopped working this Thursday to  protest the arrest of a union leader accused of subversive  activities. The intended duration of the action is unknown.    Following the orders of a prosecutor who linked Freddy  Pulecio, a member of the board of directors of the Workers Trade  Union (USO), to a case of alleged rebellion, Colombian secret  agents arrested Pulecio in eastern Arauca during the past hours.  USO is comprised of Ecopetrol [Colombian Petroleum Enterprise]  workers.    The strike has negatively affected the north-central  Barrancabermeja installations, which houses the country's most  important oil refinery, and has forced Ecopetrol to implement  contingency measures to maintain the production rate and fuel  distribution.    The strike started on Thursday afternoon and it is not known  if it will last 24 hours or if it will be extended indefinitely.</p>

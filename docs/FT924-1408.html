			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / Thames service Operating between Wandsworth and Gravesend, the 12-seat Ebenezer Scrooge will be the first of a proposed fleet of 26 fast river taxis owned by White Horse Ferries. Yesterday's inauguration coincided with the Department of Transport's establishment of a working group to examine ways of making more use of the Thames for passenger and freight traffic in London, Richard Tomkins writes. Mr Steven Norris, minister for transport in London, said he had wanted to find better ways of using the Thames for transport since his appointment last April. 'The Thames is potentially one of London's greatest transport arteries, and I believe we are not using it to anything like its full potential.' Mr Norris made the announcement shortly after launching the first of the planned White Horse fleet, that will offer a passenger service in competition to the loss-making RiverBus operation, under threat of closure. The new service will be run by Thames Fast Ferries, a subsidiary of the Swindon-based White Horse property group, which also operates the Tilbury to Gravesend ferry crossing down-river from the capital. The company's 12-seater vessels will offer a high-frequency service between Wandsworth and Docklands with more boarding and alighting points than RiverBus. The vessels will stop only on demand so shortening journey times. The river taxis are expected to be manufactured at the rate of one a month. The company is not expected to start a comprehensive service until autumn next year, and a full service is not expected until December 1994. Thames Fast Ferries said it planned to launch a high-speed commuter operation between Tilbury/Gravesend and central London next year, using 120-seat craft. Mr Norris said the Thames working group would identify obstacles that prevented people from making better use of the river. Problems include access, land ownership, safety issues and capacity. No deadline has been set for the working group's report, but it is expected to take about a year.</p>

"We all lose if the dialogue is interrupted; peaceful  measures must be sought," said Cardenas in pointing out that the  eradication of surplus coca plantations should be based on an  agreement with the producers and their grass-roots  organizations. Cardenas added: "Forceful eradication means  violence and we reject it."    According to some coca growers' leaders, the clash that  resulted in several injuries was prompted by a government  decision to forcefully eradicate surplus coca plantations. The  government has stated that the plantations eradicated during the  past few months were located near drug laboratories and the  eradication is being done according to the law.    Government Minister German Quiroga asserted that the clash  was prompted by the peasants' decision to occupy by force the  Coca Eradication Directorate (Direco), instigated by drug  traffickers.    Cardenas declined commenting on what happened in Chapare. He  said he did not have precise information but noted that if  abuses were perpetrated, Congress will demand an explanation  from the executive branch.    He said that although there are laws that provide for the  eradication of surplus plantations, it should be carried out by  mutual agreement.    Cardenas warned that the recent clashes will strain even  more  the tense relationship between coca growers organizations and  the organizations in charge of controlling coca production.    Law No. 1008 on coca and controlled substances classifies  Chapare as a transitional region in which the coca plantations  must be eradicated by common agreement with prior payment of  $2,000 per hectares to the growers. Moreover, the law requires  that the government carry out programs for alternative crops to  avoid any traumatic consequences.    However, during the past two years the eradication program  has not developed according to schedule and the benefits of the  alternative crops are not visible, which has been very  frustrating for the peasants, thus causing clashes between  producers and interdiction forces on several occasions.</p>

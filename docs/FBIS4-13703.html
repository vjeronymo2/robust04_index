			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "A Failure for Containment"] </F>   [Text] If the news going around in recent months are any  indication, there have been changes, if not drastic ones, taking  place in Iran's credit rating in international financial circles.    The breakthrough came with Germany and Japan, Iran's biggest  trading partners in the industrial world. The two countries  agreed in March to provide Iran with some $4.6b [billion] in  credits, reportedly about half of its outstanding debts.  According to Iran's Central Bank, an Iranian banking delegation  signed a $2b deal in Tokyo with a Japanese consortium, preceded  by another one with Germany, two weeks earlier, for $2.6b.    The agreements with the above two countries were soon  followed by two others with Switzerland and Austria in the  amount of some one billion dollars. The credits are to be used  for payment of delayed Iranian letters of credit held by  businessmen in those two countries.    A similar agreement covering an $800m [million] credit line  was signed with Italy not long ago. And based on announcements  by the Central Bank governor, discussions are underway for  similar agreements with Spain, France, Belgium and Netherlands.    Economic experts both here in Iran and internationally  regard  the above agreements, and the ones likely to follow, as major  success by Iran. If anything, these credits were instrumental  in halting the growing value of foreign exchange in the Iranian  money markets. The understanding with Germany and Japan also  served as a forerunner and it was as a consequence of the  agreements with these two trading partners, and their confidence  in Iran's economic stamina, that other similar agreements with  European partners followed.    The willingness by Germany and Japan, as leading industrial  countries, to grant credits to Iran means that they are wise and  pursue independent policies, and that they understand the  delicacy of the Iranian economic situation. Iran's present  economic crunch produced as a consequence of low crude oil  prices, and the war can happen to any country, as it did to both  Japan and Germany following the WWII.    The Clinton administration has taken pride in the fact that  it does not lack a clear foreign policy towards Iran. Having  identified Iran as a significant threat to America's interests  in the Persian Gulf region, the administration has tried to deal  with those threats by isolating Iran regionally, and by cutting  it off from the world economic and trading systems. Based on  this containment policy Washington has made efforts to persuade  its European allies and those in the industrial world to deny  Iran access to international capital.    In view of Washington's hostile policy towards Iran, the  agreements by Iran with its credit-extending partners can be  interpreted in two ways: That the US containment policy towards  Iran has failed, or realization of the fact that putting  pressure on Iran would not be in the best long term interests of  US and Iran's trading partners in the industrial world.    Agreements with a host of industrial countries led by  Germany  and Japan, US closest allies, cannot be interpreted but that the  US policy towards Iran has failed. Iran is not a tiny Persian  Gulf country the US would be able to isolate readily. It is an  important country geopolitically whether they like it or not.  And if anything such hostile policies as practiced by the US  towards Iran, alluded to last Wednesday by the leader of the  Islamic Republic in his meeting with armed forces officials, can  only serve make Iran more "radical", if it is any now. [sentence  as published] It also means the industrial countries would not  hesitate to follow their own interest if serious conflicts with  Washington emerge.    The US containment policy and its consequent pressure on the  Iranian economy, the brunt of which would be felt by the  vulnerable masses, can also make the possibility of any eventual  reconciliation between the two countries even more difficult and  distant.</p>

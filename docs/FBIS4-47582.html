Nine psychic-  subject pairings took part in the experiment. The subject group  consisted of five women and four men 21 to 38 years old. The  psychic group consisted of three women and two men 33 to 53  years old. All of the psychics had from 5 to 17 years experience  and notable success as healers. Each experiment included 1  background and 8 experimental sessions, each five minutes long.  The task of the subjects was to detect a threshold signal  against a noise background. The task of the psychics was to  exert a controlled influence on the performance of the subjects,  who were located in covered, soundproof booths. Four types of  influence were tested: unconcealed/negative,  unconcealed/positive, concealed/negative, and  concealed/positive. For each session, the following indicators  of success were measured: percentage of correct responses  (hits); percentage of false anxiety (fa), the sensory  sensitivity index and the beta decision-making criterion,  reaction time, reaction time distributions (average reaction  time, hit and fa reaction times), and the relevant standard  deviations. A comparative evaluation of subject performance  showed that the psychics were able to influence the subjects  during both hidden and open extrasensory influence. Several  subjects experienced changes in sensory sensitivity itself, but  these changes on the whole were of a non-specific nature from  group to group; no positive or negative effect with a one-on-one  correspondence was established. Change in reaction time  measurements were detected for both concealed and unconcealed  extrasensory influence. There were substantial differences in  the verifiable changes of psychophysical characteristics among  the different pairings. These differences were attributed to  both psychic ability and subject sensory sensitivity. Financial  support for this study was provided by the Russian Basic  Research Fund (project code: 93-06-10-760). Tables 3; references  7 Russian.</p>

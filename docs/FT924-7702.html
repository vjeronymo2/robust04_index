			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: Germany The sight of Deutsche Bank cutting earnings forecasts is usually enough to give German equities the shakes. Since the market took the news in its stride this week, one might reasonably assume the 15 per cent fall in the DAX index since May has gone far enough. With the index on a price/earnings multiple around 13 times next year's forecast earnings - even on Deutsche's gloomy predictions - the market looks cheap by historic standards. The nagging worry, though, is that German companies have lost their competitive edge. The appreciation of the D-Mark against sterling, the lira and the peseta - currencies whose countries account for about a quarter of German exports - has certainly added to the cyclical pain in European-minded industries such as engineering, steel and motor manufacture. The sight of a footloose multinational like General Motors reopening manufacturing plant in the UK is thought-provoking. Another concern is that German companies, blinded by the promise of a reunification boom, did not foresee the extent of the slowdown. This may mean overcapacity in industries from packaging to cement. The question is whether these negatives are strong enough to outweigh the interest factor. Once the Bundesbank does lower rates, German equities should find domestic support as investors switch out of cash. With the government and the Treuhand making huge demands on the long end of the bond market, equities may look a better bet. Equally, international investors have been net sellers of German equities since the end of 1990. This should reverse at the first hint that the market has touched bottom. German companies will have to take tough decisions on costs, though, if they expect more than grudging support.</p>

			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / International Company News: LTV in new move to end bankruptcy LTV, the steel company at the centre of one of the longest-running and most contentious bankruptcy cases in the US, yesterday filed its second modified plan of reorganisation. With most parties agreed on the shape of LTV's restructuring, the plan is likely to be put to creditors and shareholders in March. If approved, LTV could emerge from Chapter 11 protection within months - thus ending a bankruptcy which began in 1986. The company said yesterday if the plan was approved as submitted, it would emerge as the third-largest US steel company. It would also own a large energy unit, supplying products and equipment to the oil and natural gas industries. The new reorganisation plan is complicated. Essentially, it aims to resolve almost Dollars 6bn-worth of claims and a further Dollars 3bn of pension-related claims. Creditors' claims are levied against five different entities - the parent company and four operating divisions comprising the steel, aerospace, AM General and energy businesses. As far as LTV's under-funded pension plans are concerned. the company will make an initial cash contribution to the three steel plans of Dollars 850m (adjusted for interim funding provided while the company remains in Chapter 11), and the remaining unfunded liability will be amortised over 28 years. Annual payments will comprise a fixed element ranging between Dollars 30m and Dollars 50m a year, plus a variable element of at least 50 per cent of available cashflow after allowance for capital expenditures. Under the new plan, general unsecured creditors' recoveries should range from 16 cents on the dollar if claims are against the parent company, to almost 56 cents against the aerospace business.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Greece has told the United Nations it is willing  to sign a draft agreement with The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia [FYROM] and drop trade sanctions if the republic  agrees to change its flag and amend its constitution, Mega  Television News reported last night. Negotiations on the name,  the report said, would be left to a later date.    Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias met President  Konstandinos  Karamanlis yesterday and told him he had notified UN mediator  Cyrus Vance of Athens' position, Mega said. Earlier, the  president received Miltiadhis Evert, the New Democracy leader.    After the talks, Mr. Papoulias said Greece was now waiting  for mediator Vance to take the initiative. "We are waiting to  see what Mr. Vance will do," Mr. Papoulias told reporters.  "But, of course, in the meantime we will continue consultations  with our European partners."    Mr. Papoulias added: "There was no reaction from the  president either to the Skopje sanctions imposed by Athens last  month, or to the government's diplomatic efforts since then."  He thus denied conservative news headlines over the weekend,  alleging a growing rift between the government of Andreas  Papandreou and the presidency, as regards the former's handling  of the FYROM problem.    Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos later also  dismissed  such reports as a "nonissue," because "our constitutional order  functions perfectly, and the government spokesman is not  entitled to elaborate or comment on the presidency's own  announcements."

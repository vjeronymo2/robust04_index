			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / The Lex Column: UK property New life is struggling from the rubble that was the UK property sector. Last week, British Land issued a Pounds 200m debenture stock following a Pounds 147m rights issue from Slough Estates. Great Portland Estates and Frogmore Estates have also staged share placings to help fund acquisitions. The good reception for these issues makes it likely that a wad of other paper will follow. Companies may want to pay down debt to gain greater financial flexibility. But any enthusiastic shareholders will be taking a lot on trust despite the sector's recent strong stock market rise. Intuitively, it may seem probable that the bottom of the property cycle has been reached. Yet the latest evidence suggests both rental and capital values are still falling fast. The hope is that rights issues will lessen the compulsion for cash-strapped property companies to sell high-yielding assets. For most, the cut in gearing would not be enough to remove their attractions in the upturn. Fresh capital may also create a self-reinforcing mechanism whereby greater liquidity ensures firmer property values, more secure dividend yields and higher share prices. The theory is debatable. The most certain beneficiaries of fresh capital injections into the property market, though, will be the banks. If the appetite for new equity issues extends to some harder-pressed property developers, this will help firm up some of the banks' shakier loans. New funds may also stimulate the property market itself to the benefit of the UK's two biggest property companies - Barclays and NatWest.</p>

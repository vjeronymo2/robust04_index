			<p><P> July 2, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAPAN POISED FOR NEW JUMP IN ELECTRONICS;  </P> <P> TECHNOLOGY: THE GOVERNMENT IS HELPING INDUSTRY DEVELOP LARGE LIQUID CRYSTAL  DISPLAYS TO USE IN TVS AND OTHER CONSUMER PRODUCTS.  </P> <P> Japan's electronics industry, with government help, is pouring huge sums into  liquid crystal displays, the flat screens that are used in digital watches and  laptop computers.  </P> <P> The companies are betting that they can overcome formidable technical barriers  to develop large displays with high picture quality, allowing LCDs to be  incorporated in full-size televisions, desktop computers and other products.  </P> <P> "Technically, 40-inch LCDs with quality comparable to today's TVs will be  realized in six or seven years. We're hopeful they can be commercialized in  10," said Eiji Kaneko, director of the giant Electronics Research Laboratory, a  government-sponsored consortium of 17 companies.  </P> <P> Sharp, Hitachi, Hosiden and other Japanese firms will this year invest $1  billion to research, develop and set up plants to make LCDs. Sharp, considered  leader of the pack, plans to invest $650 million in the next three years.  </P> <P> The only foreign group that is even close to the Japanese in LCD development is  International Business Machines Corp., which makes LCDs in a joint venture with  Toshiba.  </P> <P> "This is a 'Japan-supplies-the-world' market," said Steve Myers, an industry  analyst with Jardine Fleming Securities.  </P> <P> Born in the United States and commercialized in digital watches in the  mid-1970s, LCDs have come a long way.  </P> <P> State-of-the-art production models deliver 16 colors on a laptop display.  Samples of 14-inch displays with better picture quality and color, comparable  to TV, are due out later this year but will cost $3,900.  </P> <P> In the next year or two they are expected to fall in price, and the displays  eventually will be combined with new integrated circuit memory cards to make  lightweight laptops with long battery life and good graphic displays.  </P> <P> LCDs, which operate by passing electricity through liquid crystal sandwiched  between pieces of glass, use less energy than conventional cathode ray tubes  and have flatter screens, making them attractive in portable devices.  </P> <P> In addition, LCDs may gain in popularity because they appear to emit less  electromagnetic radiation, which is seen as potentially hazardous, than cathode  ray tubes.  </P> <P> Prototypes of 20-inch LCD screens are expected next year, though  commercialization is still three to four years off. Scaling up LCDs beyond 25  inches will require technical breakthroughs that many people doubt are  possible.  </P> <P> Though researching LCDs is costly, brisk demand is helping to offset the  investments. Demand is growing rapidly for smaller LCD panels for portable TVs  and VCRs, video telephones, electronic pocket notebooks, laptop personal  computers and automobile dashboards.  </P> <P> By the middle of this decade, LCDs should eclipse cathode ray tubes as the most  valuable display technology. By 2000, the LCD business will have grown 10 times  to $13 billion, analysts say.  </P> <P> The investment blitz is reminiscent of one that gave Japan control of the  global market for memory chips in the mid-1980s.  </P> <P> But that effort had a hidden cost. When prices of memory chips fell in the  mid-1980s, Japanese firms, having overestimated demand and built up excess  capacity, were forced to sell chips below cost.  </P> <P> Today, although excess capacity is not foreseen, few companies make money on  LCDs because of the low percentage of panels produced without defects.  </P> <P> Japan's LCD development also carries political risks, because its dominance  over the market for another important electronic product may irritate trading  partners such as the United States.  </P> <P> "It's going to be another recipe for trade friction down the road," said  Virginia Kouyoumdjian, an industry analyst at Baring Securities in Japan.  </P> <P> But to Japanese companies facing high labor costs and hungry Asian competitors,  LCDs are a strategic imperative. Japanese companies can use LCDs to stay ahead  in consumer electronics and further penetrate markets for computers.  </P> <P> More broadly, Japan's focus on LCDs is a bonanza for its semiconductor  production equipment makers, the companies that make the tools for producing  microchips. Making active-matrix LCDs -- the most common type and the one  Japanese companies are betting on -- is similar to manufacturing chips.  </P> <P> Despite the Japanese blitz, the game is far from over. Active-matrix LCDs may  never be scaled up to large sizes at affordable prices. And Japanese firms,  along with many in the United States and Europe, are exploring alternative  flat-panel technologies.  </P> <P> But even if other approaches to LCDs turn out to be the screen technology of  the future, Japanese firms are likely to dominate.  </P> <P> "Whichever way the market moves, they'll have a product," Myers said.  </P></p>

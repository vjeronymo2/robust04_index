			<p><P> August 31, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: HAWAIIAN GARDENS;  </P> <P> CHURCH LOT SOLD TO BUILDER FOR SENIOR HOUSING PROJECT  </P> <P> Construction is tentatively scheduled to begin late in the fall on a 100-unit  senior citizen apartment complex on a 2.2-acre site owned by the Hawaiian  Gardens Community Redevelopment Agency.  </P> <P> Whelan Development Co. of Costa Mesa answered the agency's request last year  for a senior housing plan for the site on the south side of 226th Street, west  of Norwalk Boulevard.  </P> <P> The agency acquired the land for $785,000 from El Dorado Park Community Church,  which used it as a parking lot, project manager Theresa Dobbs said. Whelan is  buying the site from the agency for $950,000, Dobbs said.  </P> <P> Under church ownership, Dobbs said, the land generated little tax revenue for  the city. The new development is expected to generate $50,000 a year in  property taxes, according to an agency report.  </P> <P> There will be 51 one-bedroom and 49 two-bedroom units, owned and operated by  Whelan. It will take about a year to build the apartments, Dobbs said.  </P></p>

			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / The Barcelona Olympics: Boardman races to superbike gold CHRIS BOARDMAN rode his winged superbike to an Olympic gold medal in the 4,000-metre pursuit final in Barcelona last night. Boardman struck first gold not only for Britain and himself but also for Lotus, the Norwich-based sports car company, which developed his monocoque bicycle with small ground effect wings, where the handles would be on a normal racing bicycle. As he stood on the victor's podium in the warm-up area in the middle of the banked track, the Lotus engineers pressed against nearby railings photographing the man who had ridden a revolutionary machine to fame. Boardman, who said afterwards he lacked confidence all week, attacked Jens Lehmann, his German opponent, from the start. On the first lap of the 250-metre oval, he was a third of a second ahead. By the fourth lap he had pushed that lead to one second - a sizeable advantage in a race in which one circuit takes 16 seconds. Another 750 metres and it was 2 seconds, and the German must have known the race was lost. The crowd sensed victory was in the Briton's grasp and they roared Boardman on. With one lap to go the hound caught the hare and Boardman raised his fist to begin his victory lap early. In the semi-finals an hour before he had enjoyed an easier passage than his German opponent. Lehmann was taken to the line by New Zealander Gary Anderson, winning by 4/10ths of a second in 4 mins 27.23 seconds. Boardman, in contrast, only rode 4 mins 29.332 seconds, five seconds outside the world record he had set the night before. Boardman built a 3.5 second lead over Mark Kingsland of Australia, easing off to win by 2.9 seconds.</p>

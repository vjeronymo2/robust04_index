			<p><P> May 6, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEDICAL RESEARCH AND ANIMAL RIGHTS  </P> <P> The editorial on the need for and benefits of the use of animals in biomedical  research perfectly articulated for me the intellectual and spiritual  characteristics of so-called animal rights activists.  </P> <P> As a writer who deals with health and medical subjects, I am profoundly  offended by the antisocial and anti-humanitarian tricks of the activists. Three  memorable Times phrases will help me to put their behavior in perspective. That  behavior is "self-righteous tantrums masquerading as appeals to conscience,"  informed by "minds so self-absorbed and vulgar that they are unable to equate  the suffering of mice with that of dying children," and based on "a misplaced  sentimentality pretending to be compassion."  </P> <P> Thank you for this gem of clear thinking and vivid exposition.  </P> <P> REX MALCOLM  </P> <P> Woodland Hills  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Vladimir Beskromnyy] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 9 Mar -- Lately there has been encouraging  progress in several areas toward a settlement of the Bosnian  crisis. The important thing now is not to lose, but on the  contrary, to develop the positive impetus and try to consolidate  it. This was stressed by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev when he took stock of the almost two-hour long talks he  held today with Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister Haris  Silajdzic, who is visiting Moscow. The Russian foreign minister  described the talks as fruitful and frank.    The Bosnian guest shared the positive appraisal. Noting that  prerequisites have emerged for settling the conflict, Silajdzic  added: The opportunity must not be lost. It is time to move  toward the establishment of peace in Bosnia.    We expect the Russian Government to play a constructive role  in the continuation of the talks on Bosnia, Silajdzic said. At  the same time the prime minister called for Russia to pursue a  more balanced policy toward certain aspects of the Yugoslav  crisis. We hope, he added, that the Russian battalion deployed  around Sarajevo will play a positive role and make it possible  to preserve Sarajevo as a multiethnic city.    For his part, Kozyrev said that Russian diplomacy always  maintains a balanced stance with regard to the Yugoslav  conflict. The minister stressed: We reject the discriminatory  approach to the peoples of the former Yugoslavia and  particularly Bosnia-Herzegovina. All these peoples and ethnic  groups are near and dear to the Russians.    Regarding the reaching of an accord on the formation of a  Croatian-Muslim federation, Silajdzic stressed that this  agreement excludes no one. Of course, he indicated, it could  not be implemented without the Serbs' consent. We clearly  stated that our agreement would also be proposed to the Serb  side. At the same time, it is quite possible that at the moment  they are not ready to accept it. In that case, we will find  some other option that is nonetheless based on the main thing --  namely the territorial integrity and sovereignty of  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Silajdzic said that during his meeting with Kozyrev a whole  range of issues of bilateral Bosnian-Russian relations were  discussed. The prime minister of Bosnia-Herzegovina called, in  particular, for the development of cultural cooperation.    The ITAR-TASS correspondent learned that Silajdzic is to  depart from Moscow at about 1630 today.</p>

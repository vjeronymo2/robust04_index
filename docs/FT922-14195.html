			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / People: Chemical reactions SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-American drugs group, has now completed post-merger restructuring in its European pharmaceuticals operations, according to Jan Leschly, division chairman. The appointment of Charles Woler as chairman of European pharmaceuticals operations is the final move in a fundamental reorganisation which has left in place only two of the 14 most senior pharmaceutical managers at the time of the merger. Half of the 12 new appointees, like Woler, have come from outside the group, while half have been internal promotions. Woler was previously at the Paris-based Cider group, and before that was in charge of pharmaceutical, animal health and certain chemical operations in France for Hoffmann-La Roche. Leschly says Woler's experience, as a doctor and MBA graduate, would allow him to tackle the regulatory and commercial challenges of the European market over the next five years. Woler's predecessor, Martyn Greenacre, who moved to Europe following the merger two and a half years ago. has decided to return to the US with his family. He is reviewing his position with the company and is looking for new career opportunities in the US. ***** CRODA INTERNATIONAL, the UK chemicals group, has split the post currently held by Stan Cressey, managing director of the speciality chemicals business. Cressey, 58, is retiring as a director of the group because of ill-health. The company says his role is too onerous for one manager. David Clifton, managing director of the universal division, will also take charge of oleochemicals. Meanwhile, Peter Stefanini has joined Croda from Coalite Chemicals. He will become managing director of a number of divisions, including adhesives, colours, hydrocarbons and applications and will take responsibility for certain operations in the Pacific Rim. The owner of Coalite Chemicals, Anglo United, is planning to sell the business to prepare the way for buying British Coal's assets. It has appointed George Danso, currently operations director, as the new managing director.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Gu Xiusong (6328 4423 1529), affiliated with the </F> Population Studies Institute at Hebei Teachers College: "Issues  Involved in the Eastward Movement of China's Population as Seen  From Hebei Province's Population Migration"]    [Text] Around the time of the early 1980s, reports of the  "white-collar" eastward movement from western China were  beginning to be a common occurrence; since the mid-1980s, the  surge of a great army of floating population into China's  eastern coastal provinces and cities has grown into even more of  a hot topic; a 1987 population sampling confirmed the existence  of this general trend of eastward population movement; the  "fourth census" showed that all of China's eastern coastal  provinces and cities, except for Hebei Province, had  experienced a net population inflow. In fact, Hebei was no  exception. We are here discussing several issues involved in  China's eastward population movement as seen from this "special  case."  <H5>  I. Hebei's Population Outflow and Western Population </H5> Immigration    A 10 percent sampling from the "fourth census" showed that  from mid-1985 to mid-1990, while Hebei's population movement was  a net outflow, its permanent-residence-registration movement  showed a net inflow, with the net outflow being caused by the  inclusion of the large population that had moved out temporarily  for more than one year.    1. As to the population movement into Hebei from mid-1985 to  mid-1990, all mainland provinces and cities showed an  immigration to Hebei of 469,140 people, of whom 190,850 were  male and 278,290 were female, for a male-female ratio of 1:1.46.    A) As to place of origin, the numbers were greatest from  Sichuan, which accounted for 15.03 percent of Hebei's immigrant  population; Heilongjiang came next, accounting for 9.63 percent;  then in descending order came Inner Mongolia, accounting for  8.54 percent, Shanxi for 6.1 percent, Shandong for 5.4 percent,  Henan for 5.38 percent, Guangxi for 4.8 percent, Liaoning for  4.46 percent, Shaanxi for 4.15 percent, Beijing for 3.72  percent, Jilin for 3.7 percent, Guizhou for 2.94 percent, Yunnan  for 2.3 percent, and Xinjiang for 2.2 percent; the other  provinces and cities accounted for less than 10,000 people each,  with Hainan and Tibet accounting for the least, and Shanghai for  only 1,160. These figures show that:    As to the population immigration into Hebei, the  southwestern  region, which historically had less population exchange with  Hebei, accounted for the largest percentage.    The "three north" region, which historically had close  population exchange with Hebei, came second.    The immigration from southeastern coastal provinces and  cities was least.    B. As to sexual distinction, the sexual composition of the  immigrant population to Hebei from all provinces and cities had  clear regional features. The places with the highest female  percentages were Guangxi, where females made up 94.33 percent,  Guizhou at 90 percent, Sichuan at 87.64 percent, and Yunnan at  87 percent, with secondarily Inner Mongolia at 60.73 percent,  Shaanxi at 60.6 percent, Heilongjiang at 57.79 percent, Liaoning  at 54.49 percent, and Jilin at 51.2 percent. As to other  provinces and cities with immigration to Hebei of over 10,000,  such as Beijing, Tianjin, Shandong, Henan, and Xinjiang, males  ranked first in all cases. This shows that:    Of the immigrant population to Hebei from the southwest,  females ranked exceptionally high, with the northeast coming in  second.    All of the immigrant population to Hebei from its periphery  and other economically developed regions was mostly male.    2. As to the population movement out of Hebei from mid-1985  to mid-1990, the figure was 665,590, of which 431,460 was male  and 234,130 was female, for a male-female ratio of 1:0.54.    A. As to emigration destination, the numbers were greatest  to Beijing, which accounted for 33.73 percent of Hebei's  emigrant population, with Tianjin second, accounting for 15.93  percent; then in descending order came Shanxi for 7.65 percent,  Inner Mongolia for 6.13 percent, Shandong for 4.62 percent,  Henan for 4.35 percent, and Liaoning for 3.17 percent; then came  Shanghai, Sichuan, Shaanxi, Heilongjiang, Jiangsu, Guangdong,  Anhui, and Hubei, all accounting for 10,000-20,000 emigrants;  all other provinces and regions accounted for less than 10,000;  the lowest was Hainan, with only 570 emigrating to Hebei, and  only 1,180 to Guizhou. This shows generally that:    Hebei's emigrant population was concentrated mostly in the  two cities of Beijing and Tianjin, which together accounted for  nearly 50 percent of Hebei's emigrant population; second came  other peripheral provinces, making up nearly 26 percent.    Provinces and cities far from Hebei but economically  developed also accounted for more of Hebei's emigrant population.    Hebei's emigrants to interior and economically backward  regions were least.    B. As to sex composition, Hebei's emigrants to all  provinces were mostly male. For instance, males accounted for  68.35 percent of Hebei emigrants to Beijing, 50.5 percent to  Tianjin, 65.74 percent to Shanxi, 63.6 percent to Inner  Mongolia, 60.87 percent to Shandong, 64.71 percent to Henan, and  64.19 percent to Liaoning; of Hebei emigrants to economically  developed regions, such as Shanghai and Guangdong, males made up  an even higher percentage.    3. From mid-1985 to mid-1990, Hebei had a net outflow of  240,610 people, of whom 196,450 were male and 44,160 were  female, for a male-female ration of 1: 0.18.    A. As to Hebei's net-inflow population distribution, of  Mainland China's 29 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous  regions, 11 had a net outflow to Hebei, in descending order  being 53,920 from Sichuan, 30,440 from Heilongjiang, 12,600 from  Guizhou, 8,500 from Yunnan, 8,470 from Jilin, 6,140 from  Xinjiang, 5,080 from Gansu, 4,590 from Shaanxi, 4,100 from  Zhejiang, 1,590 from Hunan, and 680 from Fujian. Of these,  except for Zhejiang and Fujian that are coastal provinces, all  of the rest are located in China's southwest, northwest, and  northeast.    Except for these 11 provinces, municipalities, and  autonomous  regions, Hebei had a net outflow to all others. This included a  net emigration to Beijing of 207,040; second to Tianjin of  70,840; then came 5,500 to Liaoning, 5,390 to Shandong, 3,670 to  Henan, and 760 to Inner Mongolia, all of which are perpherial  provinces and regions to Hebei Province; in addition, Hebei had  respective net outflows to Shanghai and Guangdong of 17,640 and  9,510; Hebei's net outflow to other provinces and  municipalities was very low. This shows that:    Hebei had a net population outflow to all peripherial  provinces and municipalities, focused particularly on Beijing  and Tianjin.    Economically developed regions, such as Shanghai and  Guangdong, have begun to become the destinations for Hebei's net  outflow population.    Hebei had a net inflow from all interior and economically  backward regions. In short, the directions of net outflow and  net inflow in Hebei are very clear.    B. As to the sexual composition of Hebei's net migrant  population, the sexual flow had very prominent regional  features: of the net outflow to Hebei from the 11 provinces,  except for Fujian, all were mostly female; on the contrary,  Hebei's net outflow was all mostly male.    To sum up Hebei's net migration, it can be said that: the  border and interior population had a net inflow to Hebei, mostly  female, while Hebei's mostly male population had a net outflow  to perpherial provinces and municipalities and economically  developed regions.    4. As to the net migration by permanent residence  registration, as stated above, based on provincial public  security bureau data on permanent residence registration  movement from the founding of the PRC [1949] to 1990, while  Hebei's population movement has fluctuated sharply, it has been  a cumulative net inflow; in the 1980s, this net inflow grew,  peaking at 258,700 people, second only to that of the First Five  Year Plan; from 1985 through 1990, the net inflow was 322,100,  averaging 53,700 a year.    As to population movement in the fourth census, including  the  two categories of officially transferred permanent residence  registration and "temporary residence," while we are  temporarily unable to differentiate the two precisely, we can do  so roughly based on reason for moving: this is because the five  categories of work transfer, assigned employment, resignation or  retirement, moving as dependents, and moving for marriage  generally all require official transfer of permanent residence  registration, while all others do not; on this basis, from  mid-1985 to mid-1990, Hebei had a net permanent residence  registration inflow of 47,050 people, averaging less than 10,000  a year; while these figures are much lower than public security  ones, they still show that Hebei Province is the destination in  the eastward movement of China's western population. So the  fourth census conclusion that Hebei is a net outflow province  was due to the inclusion of the "temporary residence" population  that had moved out for more than one year.  <H5>  II. A Discussion of Several Issues Involved in the </H5> Eastward Population Movement    Summing up the above, we can say that in China's population  exchange of the 1980s, Hebei on one hand received mostly female  population emigration from the west and north, while on the  other experiencing a large outflow of its own mostly male  population to mainly Beijing and Tianjin. Such population  change had many causes and impacts. We are discussing our views  on just a few of the issues involved below.  <H5>  1. The Basic Cause of the "Displacement" in Hebei of the </H5> Eastward-Moving Population    The eastward movement of China's western population since  the  1980s is generally held to have two basic causes: a) The  eastern region already had a higher level of economic and  technological development than the western region, with reform  and opening having widened this gap. b) In correspondence to the  above-mentioned conditions, the western region has a larger  surplus rural workforce and less conversion capability, so that  commodity economy development has made an eastward population  shift inevitable.    Macroeconomically, why has Hebei become merely a temporary  "displacement" for the eastward-moving population? This is  because while Hebei has rich and diversified natural resources,  which are well disposed, giving it resource advantages and quite  good development potential, its economic development level is  still not high. Until the last few years of the 1980s, Hebei  Province's key economic and technological indexes, in contrast  to the national and three major regional ones of eastern,  central, and western, such as per capita gross output value, per  capita GVIAO [Gross Value of Industrial and Agricultural  Output], per capita national income, and per capita consumption,  were all about 15 percent below the national average, equal to  the central region, but ranking ninth in gross output value  among the 12 eastern coastal provinces, municipalities, and  autonomous regions. In addition, as to capital construction  investment, in contrast to peripheral provinces, municipalities,  and autonomous regions where population was moving to more,  Hebei was backward in both investment scale and investment  growth rate. In all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous  regions with which Hebei had a net outflow, capital construction  investment was higher than in Hebei; on the contrary, provinces,  municipalities, and autonomous regions with lower capital  construction investment had net population outflows to Hebei. In  light of this, I would make the following two points:    1. Population movement and flow is due generally to  imbalanced overall regional potential, causing population flow  from lower-potential regions to higher-potential ones. Where  economic and technological development levels are lower, regions  with better dispositions of resources, higher resource  potentials, and stronger resource potential attract population  immigration, with Hebei being in this category. This is the  major reason why, with a still low level of economic devlopment,  Hebei is both a "spigot" and a "receptor" in population movement.    2. Capital construction investment has played a key role in  population movement and mobility ever since the founding of the  PRC. The northward and westward movement of China's population  center after the founding of the PRC was consistent with our  national capital construction investment priorities, just as  today's eastward shift of population center is consistent with  our current national capital construction investment  orientation. So the facts prove that national capital  construction investment orientation remains the key driving  force in China's population movement and mobility.  <H5>  2. The Final-Assembly "Destination" of the Eastward-Moving </H5> Population    A conspicuous feature of Hebei's population movement is a  net  inflow on one hand, along with a net outflow on the other.  Such population-movement change, in addition to the  resource-environment factor, also involves an inevitable  outward-mobility capability. The historical  population-movement trend and the fourth census show that  Beijing and Tianjin have always been the priority destinations  of Hebei's outflow population. In a certain sense, if Hebei's  resource advantages were not mutually complementary with Beijing  and Tianjin's economic and cultural advantages, to form a  comprehensive regional advantage, it would seem hard to imagine  that Hebei could absorb such a large number of western  population immigrants. But the west to east  population-movement change has formed a process of western to  Hebei to Beijing and Tianjin, with Hebei as in intermediate  "displacement," and the final destination being Beijing and  Tianjin. So from a macro perspective, the final-assembly  destination of the eastward movement of the western population  is Beijing and Tianjin. This view is supported by the  following figures: a) In the four-plus decades since the  founding of the PRC, Hebei has had a net immigration of about 2  million. But projected from a typical survey of our  population movement, about 1 million have moved from Hebei to  Beijing and Tianjin during the same period. b) The fourth  census shows that from mid-1985 to mid-1990, Hebei had a net  inflow of over 190,000, along with a net outlfow to Beijing and  Tianjin of more than 270,000. So it could be said that Hebei  has guided over 80,000 western immigrants to Beijing and Tianjin.    In light of this, how can the populations of large cities,  such as Beijing and Tianjin, not be uncontrollable? This is  essentially a matter of not paying enough attention to  controlling urban functions, as sound functions inevitably  increase population. As to the laws of urban evolution, the lack  of decentralized urban functions makes it hard to control  population size. In addition, population control of large  cities, such as Beijing and Tianjin, requires overall planning  with the whole nation, particularly neighboring regions, as well  as coordination measures, without which it would be hard for it  to be effective. Furthermore, in light of China's large  population and its uneven distribution, unless effective steps  are taken to strictly control our urban population, the  population-expansion consequences will be even more severe than  otherwise. There are two figures here that are much deserving  of mention: a) Sample surveys show that in the first 35 years  after the founding of the PRC, about one-third of the net  immigrant population to Beijing was from Hebei. b) The fourth  census showed that from mid-1985 to mid-1990, about one-third of  the net inflow to Beijing of approximately 600,000 was from  Hebei. If this reflects a certain pattern, in which Hebei  receives an unending stream of western population and Beijing  and Tianjin a similar population inflow from Hebei, then it will  be hard to prevent the expansion of the populations of Beijing  and Tianjin.    While these superficial views are likely somewhat biased, it  is hoped that they will arouse attention and thorough study.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Artlette Khuri: "Paris Conference Concludes </F> Meetings With Call for Transitional Government for Accord and  Liberation"]    [Excerpts] Paris -- The "Lebanese National Conference"  [LNC] yesterday concluded its meetings in Paris with a number of  resolutions providing for the formation of a Constituent  Committee to draw up the conference's bylaws, a Board of  Trustees to replace that committee as soon as the board is  formed, and a National Assembly to act as the legislative body.  It also recommended the formation of a transitional government.    The resolutions, which were drafted after a series of  contacts on the sidelines of the conference and in close  consultation with former prime minister General Michel 'Awn who  kept on introducing amendments to the draft resolutions until  late at night the day before yesterday, stated that the LNC "is  a comprehensive united establishment embodying the patriotic  trend working for Lebanon's freedom, independence, and full  sovereignty over all its territory with its historical and  internationally recognized borders." [passage omitted]    The conference defined its "struggle priorities" by setting  a  number of targets including "liberation" through "expansion of  the struggle work at Lebanese and international levels by  mobilizing Lebanese resources in Lebanon and the diaspora." It  also called for the mobilization [tajyish] of the Lebanese  world's resources "in order to influence public opinion and the  decisionmakers on Lebanese fateful issues, particularly the five  permanent members of the Security Council, especially the United  States, and also the Arab states which have no interest in  sacrificing Lebanon's freedom, sovereignty, and independence."    The conference assigned to the Board of Trustees the task of  pursuing dialogue and constitutional studies with prominent  Lebanese and international experts to perceive and offer  alternative options to the sectarian regime to pave the way for  a political secular regime that would transfer power from the  sects to the state and promulgate laws that would define the  basic rights of the Lebanese citizen and offer a concept of a  new structure for the state ensuring the executive independence  of every authority as well as independent judicial control for  every authority.    The conference asserted that the Arab-Israeli peace plan "is  the most important diplomatic framework as far as Lebanon's fate  is concerned and it would constitute a definite threat to  Lebanon's sovereignty and independence if Lebanon went to the  negotiations represented by a government whose decisions have  been mortgaged and confiscated, a government which lacks  legitimacy and public mandate." It renewed the call for  "tripartite negotiations by Israel, Syria, and Lebanon."    It urged work for "solid and comprehensive Lebanese accord  embracing the Lebanese leaderships which accept a negotiation  plan for the full and absolute liberation of Lebanon, in the  framework of a transitional government representing all parties  which accept the principle of peace and work for it." The  conference suggested that "the transitional government should,  after completing the peace process and liberating Lebanon from  every direct and indirect military and semimilitary presence,  pass a new electoral law on which free parliamentary elections  would be held under UN supervision, giving the right of voting  and candidacy to all the Lebanese people at home and abroad."

Liu Baisong, president of the Northeast Asia Railway and  Port  Corporation, Ltd. of Jilin, China, came to the ROK on 20 January  to discuss this matter. He said on 23 January: "The Najin Port  development project is supposed to be jointly promoted by China  and North Korea, and North Korea has expressed its position that  it does not oppose ROK participation in the project in a joint  venture with China." He also said that he had sounded out ROK  enterprises like Daewoo and Samsung on their intention to  participate in the project during his visit to the ROK and that  they "had expressed their intent to actively participate."    China is also asking ROK companies to make joint investments  in the construction of a 5 km-long borderline railway connecting  China's Hunchun and North Korea's Hunyung.    The project of enlarging the No. 3 and No. 4 Piers of Najin  Port and equipping them with modern facilities requires a total  amount of $60 million, and China wants the ROK to invest  approximately $30 million in the project.    North Korea hopes to begin construction in April, and China  plans to start in June after confirming ROK participation.</p>

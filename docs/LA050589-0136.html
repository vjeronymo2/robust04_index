			<p><P> May 5, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BACKERS CHEERED, DEVASTATED BY VERDICT  </P> <P> Oliver L. North's ever-loyal supporters rallied to his side and belittled the  jury's verdict after his conviction Thursday on charges arising from the  Iran-Contra scandal. But Democratic lawmakers and others troubled by North's  activities said the verdict proved that North had obstructed Congress and  undermined the Constitution.  </P> <P> Orange and Los Angeles counties' Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Lomita), a close  North friend and ally, described the former Marine officer as "absolutely  elated" by his acquittal on nine of the 12 charges he faced.  </P> <P> "He was found guilty of cutting corners and found innocent of all criminal  wrongdoing," contended Rohrabacher, a former White House speech writer for whom  North campaigned extensively last year. "This has been a political trial since  Day 1 and it's time for President Bush to end the sham and the circus and give  Ollie North a pardon."  </P> <P> Orange County Rep. C. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach) said he was "delighted"  that North was found not guilty of the more serious counts brought in the  indictment more than a year ago. Cox said that it was a "sad commentary" that  all that resulted from the $12-million trial was conviction on charges that he  said were equivalent to "the fire department (being convicted) for double  parking at the scene of the fire."  </P> <P> Rohrabacher and Cox tapped North's image as a hero of the conservative movement  by having the retired Marine lieutenant colonel campaign for them in last  year's Republican primary. North helped each to raise about $100,000 for their  races in large fields of GOP candidates.  </P> <P> But another friend called the felony conviction a "devastating" personal blow  to North, who won the Silver Star and two Purple Hearts for service in the  Vietnam War.  </P> <P> "Here's a man of great personal pride and honor, who spent his entire life  trying to live up to a set of standards, trying to serve his country  faithfully," said Patrick Korten, a Justice Department spokesman during the  Reagan Administration. "And now, to be convicted of a felony -- think of it, a  soldier who served his country in war, who can no longer legally possess a  firearm."  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Comment From Reagan  </P> <P> Former President Ronald Reagan, through a spokesman, declined to comment on the  verdict.  </P> <P> Orange County Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove) also minimized the  severity of the verdict, saying that North had already admitted shredding  documents to protect a covert operation and had accepted the gift of a home  security system because his family was getting death threats at the time.  </P> <P> Dornan said he was the first to announce the verdict to a throng of reporters  gathered on the steps of the U.S. Courthouse Thursday afternoon. A fervent  North supporter, he said he didn't have a seat and was being escorted out of  the courtroom as the jury announced its verdict. Dornan slipped out while Judge  Gerhard A. Gessell kept reporters locked in the courtroom to prevent an  unseemly scramble for the telephones and later rode down an escalator with  North and his wife.  </P> <P> "He was obviously showing signs of great relief and so was Betsy," Dornan said.  "It was a tremendous pressure lifted off their backs."  </P> <P> Of the trial, itself, he said: "I think it is ludicrous to give amnesty to  draft dodgers and rake over the coals a combat-tested Marine who was always  operating, he thought, inside his chain of command. . . . "  </P> <P> Lawmakers who conducted the hearings that made North a national icon, adored as  a hero by millions of Americans and condemned as a misguided zealot by many  others, said that the verdict vindicated their previous -- and highly  contradictory -- opinions of the man and his actions.  </P> <P> Sen. Daniel K. Inouye (D-Hawaii), chairman of the Senate select committee on  the Iran-Contra scandal, said that the North verdict "reaffirms the conclusion"  of the Senate and House investigating panels that "fundamental processes of  governance were disregarded and the rule of law was subverted."  </P> <P> Rep. Lee Hamilton (D-Ind.), chairman of the House Iran-Contra committee said:  "I don't feel any sense of elation. I don't feel any sense of disappointment.  My feeling is that Col. North had a fair trial."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Called 'Tragic' Figure  </P> <P> Sen. Warren B. Rudman (R-N.H.), also a member of the Senate panel, called North  a "tragic" figure but added: "He did some things which in America today you  have to be held accountable for."  </P> <P> Sen. Orrin K. Hatch (R-Utah) said: "If you look at it objectively, Oliver North  has been largely vindicated. . . . The jury, because of all the hype on this  thing, felt it had to come up with a conviction. They came up with a compromise  verdict that was the least offensive verdict for Col. North."  </P> <P> Rep. Henry J. Hyde (R-Ill.), an ardent North supporter who was in the courtroom  when the jury read the verdict, said that the former National Security Council  aide was "very tranquil," despite the guilty verdicts on three counts.  </P> <P> Others were left unsatisfied by the verdict.  </P> <P> Robert C. McFarlane, North's former boss at the White House who has already  pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges in the scandal, said: "We are no closer  to solving the basic issues that led to Iran-Contra than we were two years ago.  It will be very sad if five years from now our children and grandchildren look  back at Iran-Contra as simply a criminal matter. It was a very serious breach  of process."  </P> <P> Staff writers Robin Wright, Douglas Jehl and Don Shannon in Washington and  Claudia Luther in Orange County contributed to this story.  </P></p>

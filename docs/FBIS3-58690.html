According to Ciampi, the dialogue with Russia must be  constructive. This dialogue must see the West committed to  spurring Moscow to carry on with its reforms, while at the same  time aiding Russia to overcome this difficult and lengthy  transition period, Ciampi said.    During his speech to the summit, Ciampi said that giving  greater political emphasis to the coming G-7 summit meant making  a valid contribution to a dialogue for even greater  rapprochement between Russia and the West.    Italian Foreign Minister Beniamino Andreatta Monday [10  January] also stressed the need for a tie-in between NATO and  the Conference for Security and Cooperation in Europe, stating  that CSCE peacekeeping missions, above all in Asia and in the  republics of the former Soviet Union, cannot help but draw on  Russian national interest which must, however, be  internationalized, not an instrument of an imperialistic policy.    While on the subject of peace-keeping, Andreatta said that  the experience in Somalia and Bosnia has suggested that the use  of military units is not always the most suitable instrument for  operations having a large humanitarian content. There is a need  to find crowd control measures which are not lethal in nature,  he said.    Italy has also called for greater and more analytical ground  observations so as to better identify those responsible for  truce-breaking.</p>

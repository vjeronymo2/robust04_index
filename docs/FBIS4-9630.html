			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Valentin Aleksandrov by </F> Simeon Danevski; place and date not given: "Valentin  Aleksandrov: `I Am Not Afraid To Lose My Post....'"]    [Text] [Danevski] Mr. Aleksandrov, are you sure that a  certain party is demanding your resignation?    [Aleksandrov] I have this impression, that my resignation is  being demanded.    [Danevski] An impression is one thing; facts are something  completely different.    [Aleksandrov] I do not have facts. Officially, no one has  spoken with me on this matter. I learn everything from the mass  media. Anyway, there will be nothing terrible if I leave my  post.    [Danevski] Is your conflict with General Lyuben Petrov  really so deep?    [Aleksandrov] There is no conflict at all. There was a  dispute whether those officers who must retire should do this  now or in the fall.    [Danevski] What was your opinion?    [Aleksandrov] I had the opinion that we should not touch  them until the fall, or until the Defense Bill is enacted.    [Danevski] Do you accept President Zhelev's accusation that  the Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP] is responsible for the small  military budget?    [Aleksandrov] I cannot comment on this statement.    [Danevski] Is it true that you demanded a small Bulgarian  Army?    [Aleksandrov] It is the parliament that determines the size  of the Army. I only said that, with the amount of money we  received, we can provide food, clothing, and footwear for only a  certain number of troops.    [Danevski] If you think so, is there not the danger of  having no army at all, because we do not have any money for it?    [Aleksandrov] This is none of my business. The minister of  defense does not provide funds. He only spends them.    [Danevski] Did you want to create a mixed Bulgarian-Turkish  battalion that would establish peace in Bosnia?    [Aleksandrov] A noted Bulgarian politician -- Mr. Pasi --  advocated the establishment of such a battalion. Do not  attribute his ideas to me, especially since this is a matter for  the unforeseeable future. I do not commit myself to such ideas  and claims.    [Danevski] Perhaps he was only testing the idea?    [Aleksandrov] It is fully possible.</p>

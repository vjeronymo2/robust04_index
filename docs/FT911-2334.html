			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / London Stock Exchange: Gas weak on pricing formula BUSY two-way trade developed in British Gas after the company agreed to abide by a new pricing formula for the company's 17m-plus domestic customers from the gas industry regulator, Ofgas. The new formula, the inflation rate minus five points, was said by analysts to have been as bad as they could have expected. Gas dropped to 238p on the news, compared with last Friday's close of 244 1/2 p, but then rallied to 245p before dipping again and closing a fraction easier on balance at 244p. Turnover of 21m was the day's highest of the Footsie stocks. Among bears of the stock, Mr John Toalster of Strauss Turnbull, described the pricing formula as 'very tough', while Mr Steve Turner at Smith New Court said that 'at a stroke Mr McKinnon (director-general of Ofgas) has removed any prospect of real earnings growth over the next five years'. BZW's utilities team said it was 'still negative' on Gas, while County NatWest told clients to switch from Gas to British Telecom, where the company faces a better earnings dividend and regulatory profile. Kleinwort Benson, a strong supporter of Gas, said that although at first glance the Ofgas terms were 'not good', the company said its dividend policy, promising 15 per cent growth, remained unchanged. Mr Jeremy Hudson at Shearson Lehman remained bullish, also highlighting the 'powerful' dividend argument. Internationals rise The strength of the dollar at the opening of trade gave international stocks a boost. The rise was led by ICI, on good weekend press comment and as brokers continued to argue that last week's cautious annual meeting marked the low point in the company's fortunes during the current recession. ICI shares climbed 16 to 1076p. Hoare Govett's assessment that Reuters was undervalued helped sentiment, and steady US buying made its presence felt in Hanson. Reuters advanced 23 to 831p in good turnover for the stock of 1m. Hanson rose 4 1/2 to 229 1/2 p in more typical levels of business as 4.1m changed hands. Glaxo continued last week's recovery with a rise of 21 to 1124p. Asda slipped a penny to 121p against the wider trend on 2.2m shares traded as brokers reduced their profits estimates following meetings with the company at the end of last week. Hoare Govett, which had already surprised the market by forecasting lower profits for 1992/93, cut its estimate for that year still further, from Pounds 189m to Pounds 175m. A slower stores opening programme in 1991/92 combined with increased competition from its rivals and larger interest payments are eroding Asda's profitability, Hoare said. Unilever shed 3 to 748p on switching out of the plc shares into the NV. There was also some unease ahead of the first-quarter figures, due in May. Profits of Pounds 340m to Pounds 350m, against Pounds 369m, are expected. Barclays was among the best performers in the banks, edging up 4 to 446p after a buy recommendation from Panmure Gordon's Mr Tim Clarke. He said Barclays was within a whisker of being the highest yielding stock in the sector and yet is one of the strongest and most profitable. Bank of Scotland, scheduled to report preliminary figures tomorrow, with County NatWest expecting Pounds 135m against last time's Pounds 193.5m, eased 2 1/2 to 132 1/2 p. CE Heath, the insurance broker, came in for rough treatment, closing 10 lower at 512p after Ms Julianne Jessup at BZW downgraded her profits and dividend estimates. Ms Jessup said BZW was an 'emphatic seller of Heath', and chopped her March 1991 estimate from Pounds 30m to Pounds 27.3m and that for 1992 from Pounds 33m to Pounds 29m. She reduced her 1992 dividend forecast from 27p to 26p. Ms Jessup said Heath's dependence on investment income made it vulnerable to falling interest rates, and also cited continuing soft insurance markets and adverse movements in the dollar. She believed Heath's broking operations had had a disappointing renewal season. Reports that both the chairman and chief executive of Allied-Lyons will this week announce early retirement from July, rather than 1992, caused brief dullness in the shares. They recovered, however, to end 7 higher on the day at 527p. Sterling/dollar influences combined with American buying ensured a firmer trend for Grand Metropolitan, which rose 13 to 803p. The buoyancy of the equity market aroused speculation of takeover possibilities both for Footsie and lesser-known industrial stocks. Pilkington was inevitably to the fore, advancing 8 to 194p in relatively thin trading as hopes resurfaced of a bid from a UK conglomerate. Once again the principal choice was BTR. Cookson benefited from both views of the stock being a good recovery play as well as a possible bid target. Again, business was rather light, but the new fully paid shares moved ahead 7 to 132p. Trimoco, the automotive distributor, was bought on suggestions that either the Saudi Arabian Jameel organisation, a major shareholder, or the UK's Tom Cowie group might be interested in acquiring the company. Trimoco appreciated 3 to 22 1/2 p. Reports that a predator was looking at CIA Group stimulated support for shares of the USM-quoted media-buying company, and they rose to 146p before closing 16 ahead on balance at 141p. Worries that digestion of the new shares resulting from the rights issue could hold back Morgan Crucible saw the old fall 13 to 224p ex-all; the new nil-paid lost 2 to 6p premium. Demerger stories combined with further dividend buying - the interim results are scheduled for May 8, and thus fall within the current three-week trading account - boosted Trafalgar House again. In trading volume of 2.6m shares the price climbed 10 to 264p. Hopes revived of MB Caradon finding a buyer for its stake in French group CMB Packaging and the stock climbed 10 to 226p. British Telecom put on 4 1/2 to 364p, helped by the County recommendation to switch from Gas. Marks and Spencer firmed just a penny to 255p, underperforming a stronger market as dealers anticipated reductions in profits forecasts following the announcement of provisions of Pounds 16m to cover the cost of 850 redundancies. Only a proportion of this will affect the bottom line and profits estimates are likely to be cut from between Pounds 615m to Pounds 620m to Pounds 610m. EuroDisney moved ahead 32 to 1175p after the company said it was contesting legal action by architects Atelier. Any dispute with Atelier, EuroDisney said, would not affect plans for completion of the attractions in its theme park near Paris. Granada rallied from an initially depressed 181p to finish a net 3 up at 190p following reports that institutional investors are pressing for top-level management changes ahead of an expected Pounds 150m rights issue and a number of disposals needed to reduce debt burden. Electricity distribution stocks lacked support, but water issues were given another push by several brokers, notably Smith New Court. The latter was heavily involved in the Water Package, which moved up 28 to Pounds 2983. Tootal appeared to win the latest round of the verbal battle with hostile bidder Coats Viyella. Its forecast of a 40 per cent rise in profits for the year to next January was criticised by Mr Neville Bain, the Coats chief executive, as being 'imprecise'. He said that 'we are not going to overpay' for Tootal, but the shares gained 2 to 79p, reflecting views that the 65p cash per share offer would be increased, probably by way of an all-paper bid. Coats Viyella firmed to 141p xd. TR High Income became the first investment trust managed by Touche Remnant to tap the market for funds. It called for Pounds 9m through a rights issue, consisting mainly of new shares, although some new subscription shares are also being issued. The proposals left the former 4 lower at 106p and the latter 2 off at 30p. Property and motor distributor Wyndham rallied 7 to 14p after Friday's steep fall on a sell recommendation.

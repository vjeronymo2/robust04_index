			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / Arts: A triumphant Semiramide brings the house down - Rossini Opera Festival THIS YEAR'S Rossini bicentenary has been an occasion for rejoicing everywhere, but hardcore Rossinians have been keeping an eye on Pesaro, the composer's birthplace, to see how its pace-setting Rossini Opera Festival and its parent organization, the Rossini Foundation, would celebrate the important anniversary. The 1992 festival opened with new productions of The Barber of Seville and Semiramide, along with exhibitions, publications, and promise of more music to come. In other words, Pesaro is joyfully doing its duty by the composer who brought glory to the city and also - practical man that he was - made the city heir to his sizeable fortune (which underwrites the Foundation). The opening night Barber was, sad to say, a sore disappointment and high hopes were dashed. High, because in theory this production should have been particularly interesting: shunning the big-name stars associated with earlier festivals, the artistic direction called on young, almost unknown artists and engaged a conductor, Paolo Carignani, still at the outset of his career. To stage the work, they chose the veteran Luigi Squarzina; but this, too, was an unconventional choice, for Squarzina is most admired for his serious work, and humour is not his long suit. It is not the conductor's, either. He and Squarzina deliberately set out to present a Barber shorn of traditional gags and grimaces; actually, Squarzina made up some gags of his own and trotted out some hoary stage action. Obviously a fine musician, Carignani led the RAI Orchestra of Turin with sober accuracy and delicacy, but absolutely without sparkle. Coupled with Squarzina's heavy, unspontaneous staging, this approach spelled disaster, especially as the singers lacked a sustaining familiarity with their roles. The obtrusive, inappropriate sets of Giovanni Agostinucci (Bartolo's study transformed into the Bologna anatomy theatre) contributed to the oppression. Nevertheless, Roberto Frontali (recently admired as Rodrigo in a Genoa Don Carlos) sang with style and indicated a roguish wit, still to be developed. Bruce Ford, not in his best form, was an acceptable Almaviva, though he relied too much on pianissimo singing. So did some of the others: Maurizio Picconi's Bartolo was often inaudible. Giovanni Furlanetto, lanky, sharp-faced, seems born to sing Basilio and will surely grow into the part: this was a dry run. Whether or not Lola Casariego will ever be a real Rosina is hard to say; the evidence in Pesaro was surely negative. The voice is unreliable at top and bottom, and the style was mannered, superficial, all smirks and flounces, with no hint of the real character so clearly defined in the music. After this experience, the audience approached Semiramide with understandable apprehension: over four hours of music in the inhospitable Sports Palace, with singers unknown and a young producer. What ensued was one of the most exciting evenings that Pesaro has vouchsafed in recent years. The veteran scholar-conductor Alberto Zedda (who collaborated on the edition) knows and - more important - feels every note of the score. He neither dawdled nor sped, but let the long, complex numbers unfold at their proper pace; the singers were not indulged, nor were they prodded. Fortunately, all of them displayed an excellent sense of tempo and a real dramatic skill. The Georgian soprano Iano Tamar was an unusual Semiramide: not the lighter coloratura we are used to, but a genuine dramatic soprano capable of remarkable agility. As Arsace, Gloria Scalchi (who made a stunning impression a couple of years ago in Ricciardo e Zoraide) confirmed her position as a valuable addition to the Rossinian ranks. But the great triumph of this production was Michele Pertusi's Assur: a flexible, dark bass voice, accompanied by penetrating dramatic skill. His 'mad scene' towards the end of the opera brought down the house (and the Palazzo dello Sport is quite a house to bring down). Gregory Kunde, a relatively new Rossini tenor, with a sweeter voice than most in that category, turned Idreno into a major figure; and the even smaller part of Oroe was masterfully interpreted by Ildebrando D'Arcangelo, another Pesaro debutant of great promise. The musical success was parallelled by the overwhelming success of the production: director and designer was Hugo De Ana, who made his Italian debut in 1990 with a Rossini opera (Mos) in Bologna. He filled the vast stage with supers, dancers, mingling with the chorus in a pageant that was always meaningful, apposite and uncluttered. The soldiers really looked fierce; the zealots created authentic tension. The gestures of the singers were hieratic, inhuman, on a larger-than-life scale; and yet the more private scenes found the characters equally convincing as their extreme emotions were laid bare. There was an Oriental quality about the costumes - sometimes suggesting Siam, or even Bali - and also about the acting: entrances were commanding in the manner of Kabuki. The monumental sets enhanced this splendid, awesome dimension. And the final tableau, a light-hearted scene of the reaping of grain, set the seal on the celebration. Visitors to the festival, unless they want to spend their days on the beach or in excursions into the lovely hills behind the city, can pleasantly pass some hours in the Museo Civico, where the rooms have been rearranged to show off to advantage the several dozen pictures Pesaro inherited from Rossini. Or, they can visit the handsome Palazzo Montani Antaldi, newly restored, which houses a commemorative Rossini exhibition, rich in unfamiliar treasures or in new juxtapositions of familiar ones. The curator, Mauro Bucarelli, has assembled hundreds of items - autographs, portraits, personal objects (even one of the composer's wigs) and albums - to create a picture not only or Rossini but of an age. The catalogue will remain a permanent, indispensable contribution to Rossini scholarship.</p>

			<p>930809 FT  09 AUG 93 / Lloyd's poised to reveal result of crucial ballot LLOYD'S OF LONDON faces further possible controversy as it prepares to disclose the results of a ballot of its 20,000-plus underwriting members tomorrow. Victory in the vote for rebel loss-making Names could shatter confidence at the insurance market and wreck plans to introduce new incorporated investors. Mr David Rowland, chairman of Lloyd's, conceded last month that if a motion backing him and Mr Peter Middleton, the chief executive, were defeated he would seek a formal vote of confidence from members. This would trigger a new battle with disgruntled Names, whose losses over the past five years amount to more than Pounds 5.5bn. The rebels are demanding that members be given the right to veto new capital-raising plans. They also want new investors to help pay the losses of Names worst affected by in future contributing a portion of profits. In addition Names are pressing Lloyd's to concede that it owes a legal duty of care to its underwriting members. These issues were discussed early last month at an extraordinary general meeting called by Names. Approval of either motion would disrupt efforts by Lloyd's to draw up rules setting out terms on which new incorporated members could participate at the market. Schemes to launch investment companies or trusts by Salomon Brothers, JP Morgan, Samuel Montagu, BZW and other banks are well advanced. Lloyd's hopes to be able to attract as much as Pounds 500m in capital from institutions and retail investors in time to support its underwriting next year. The fresh money would help to shore up a capital base which has shrunk by nearly Pounds 3bn since 1990. Bankers stress that many difficulties must be overcome and a fresh downturn in confidence at Lloyd's could persuade some to pull out. One corporate financier said last week that possible investors are already cautious because of uncertainty about their potential involvement in the market's huge asbestosis and pollution exposures. Lloyd's hopes it can negotiate an out-of-court settlement with hard-hit Names but stresses that only limited funds are available. Two panels - one examining claims involving Names on 37 syndicates, the other investigating financial resources available - are expected to report by late autumn and offers could be made to Names by the end of the year.</p>

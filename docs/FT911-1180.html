			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Gloomy Jarvis halved to Pounds 1m JARVIS, the construction and property group which has taken advantage of the recession to buy failed building companies from the receivers, yesterday announced a sharp fall in profits for 1990. The taxable outcome fell to Pounds 1.01m compared with Pounds 2.01m for the nine months to end-1989. Turnover rose to Pounds 64.03m (Pounds 55.34m). Mr Harvey Bard, chairman, warned: 'The UK construction industry remains deep in recession and we anticipate that 1991 will be a very difficult year for all involved in the industry.' The group's balance sheet, however, remains strong with net borrowings equivalent to 34 per cent of shareholders funds. The company had no off-balance sheet financing. During the last 12 months Jarvis has acquired from receivers the Shephard Hill civil engineering and Newman Shopfitter businesses. Mr Bard said: 'The severe recession in the construction industry led to a number of basically sound subsidiary businesses being forced onto the market by problems within their parent companies. Using our financial strength we were able to take advantage of this.' Falling commercial property prices prompted Jarvis to write down the value of its property investment portfolio by Pounds 3.6m. It also wrote off Pounds 700,000 against goodwill on acquisitions reducing shareholders funds to Pounds 17.6m. A proposed final dividend of 1.175p makes a total of 2p (1.875p) for the year. Earnings per share fell from an annualised 9.9p to 4.2p.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Lagos, June 28 (AFP) -- Jailed Nigerian  pro-democracy leader Moshood Abiola has fallen ill under  mysterious circumstances, his daughter said Tuesday [28 June].    Lola Abiola-Edewor told AFP she had received "an ugly  report"  about her father's health through a "secret message sent to the  family by a reliable source."    "The unexplainable happened less than 24 hours after reports  had it that he was hale and hearty," she said.    Abiola was arrested by Nigeria's military junta last  Thursday  after declaring himself president and commander in chief. He is  widely believed to have won elections a year ago that the  military annulled on grounds of fraud.</p>

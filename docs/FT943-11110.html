			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / Equity Markets: Other markets CHEMICALS Generally good results are expected this week from DSM and Akzo Nobel, the Dutch chemicals groups, as well as the French group Rhone-Poulenc, writes John Pitt. These three will be followed later in the month by the three leading German groups, all of which should confirm the positive state of the industry. Hoare Govett comments that over the past six months the volumes for a number of basic chemical products has improved strongly, while demand/supply ratios have become relatively tight. 'As a result, pricing has slowly started to strengthen.' Hoare favours the Dutch groups, and believes that the second-quarter results will provide a pleasant surprise. However, it remains more cautious on the French company. 'We still believe the long-term prospects to be sound, but the second quarter might be somewhat disappointing as the possibility of negative surprises in the financials (as in the first quarter) cannot be excluded.' Goldman Sachs tends to agree, while also highlighting the strength of the German groups. In all, says Goldman, the stabilisation of the dollar and a return of confidence to the financial markets 'can be expected to lead to a renewed period of outperformance for the sector'. Paribas also rates Bayer as a buy, along with more defensive companies such as Henkel and Air Liquide, but it too highlights the Dutch and French groups as buys. BANKS The Swiss bank reporting season continues this week with half-year figures, expected on Wednesday, from UBS. Analysts are forecasting that the Big Three banks will show sharply lower earnings during the first half of 1994 after exceptional trading profits made during the 1993 stock market spree. Half-year profits at UBS, the country's largest bank, are expected to have fallen by between 28 per cent and 35 per cent due to a 45 per cent to 50 per cent drop in trading income. Better-than-expected results could breath fresh life into the stock market after last week's largely downbeat performance. However, one analyst warned that bad news from the banks could see a slide of up to 10 per cent in their share prices which would be carried over into a 3 per cent to 4 per cent fall for the market as a whole. The German reporting season continues this week with figures from BHF-Bank, Vereinsbank and Hypo-Bank. MILAN Politics is likely to remain firmly in the driving seat this week, after last week's excursions which saw the market fall by almost 5 per cent in the first three days before a more positive tone emerged. However, the market still has its supporters. UBS says that there is much in Italy that now looks good value for the ocean-faring investor with good sea legs. The currency is undervalued, 10-year bonds offer a yield seven points above the current inflation rate, and the equity market has fallen sharply since May, in spite of promising growth prospects. HONG KONG China enterprises, listed on the Hang Seng Index - the so-called H shares - are likely to remain at the centre of investors' attention this week, ahead of the launch of the new Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which starts next Monday, writes Louise Lucas. Strong demand pushed prices of the H shares up last week, ending a sluggish period for the counters. There are now 10 H shares trading on the Hong Kong market; Qingling Motors will become the eleventh when its shares start trading on August 17. The reporting season is now under way, although the blue chip sector will do not begin to give details until the middle of the month. However, Guangzhou Shipyard International - one of last year's H share listings - unveils its interims on Friday. Brokers reckon trading will be in a narrow range. On the plus side, sentiment has improved following the better than expected results achieved at last Tuesday's land auction. But on the downside, concerns remain over US interest rates and the overheating economy in China. Turnover is expected to settle down after a surge towards the end of last week, inspired by the expiration of July futures contracts. TOKYO Confidence, lifted by last week's buying by public funds, is expected to remain firm as worries about Nikkei index falling below 20,000 have subsided. However, aggressive buying above 20,500 is unlikely because of lingering concerns over the yen and corporate profits, writes Emiko Terazono. Dealers and individual investors may actively trade Nippon Telegraph and Telephone and East Japan Railway, two semi-privatised companies, ahead of the auction for Japan Tobacco's share offering in mid-August.

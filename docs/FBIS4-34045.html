			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Message to the Mexican people from the Institutional </F> Revolutionary Party (PRI) National Executive Committee: "The PRI  on Chiapas"]    [Text] The National Executive Committee [CEN] of the  Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI], aware of the changes  observed in the conflict unleashed by the EZLN [Zapatist  National Liberation Army] in the mountains of Chiapas, and in  accordance with the demands made yesterday by our candidate for  president of the republic, Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, states  the following:    1. We hereby express our concern over the EZLN communique  which rejects the peace agreement proposed by the commissioner  for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas on behalf of the  government and which brings the dialogue to an end, even though  the Mexican people have at all times supported the civilized  position adopted by the government.    2. The PRI and all citizens of good faith urge the immediate  resumption of negotiations and support for the Chiapas  government in every way possible as the conflict enters a new  phase.    3. We reiterate that a political solution is the only option  that remains in keeping with our convictions, and that dialogue  and concerted efforts are essential within the de jure state  because, thanks to the efforts of generations, Mexico is a  country of institutions and laws.    4. We agree with the government of the republic's statement,  made yesterday, with regard to maintaining the cease-fire  decreed on 12 January as a prior step toward total and equitable  peace because a truce alone will not satisfy the hopes of the  Mexican people, nor will it fulfill their desire for harmony.    5. We confirm our democratic conviction, proven by our  decisive participation in the Agreement for Peace, Democracy,  and Justice on 27 January 1994, which led to amendments of the  general Constitution of the republic, the Federal Code of  Institutions and Electoral Procedures, and penal laws by totally  impartial electoral authorities and which allowed the Federal  Electoral Institute to adopt measures to guarantee that the 21  August elections will be credible, honest, efficient,  legitimate, and fully in keeping with the law.    The PRI is unconditionally committed to perfecting the  country's democratic life and confirms that violence is  unacceptable because it is only through institutions that  Mexico's problems can be resolved.    6. We agree that democracy can be achieved only if it is  based on self-sustained and balanced development, national  sovereignty, and social justice, and that it is time to deal  more efficiently with social backwardness, regional injustices,  and the unfortunate conditions experienced by many Indians.    7. We do not agree that hope for peace fostered in Mexico  over the past few months has been thwarted.    8. We hereby confirm that the time has come for political  tolerance; therefore, on Thursday 9 June, our candidate sent a  personal message to the eight presidential candidates inviting  them and the country's social organizations to a direct dialogue  with a view to agreements that will support a national unity  agreement for democracy, justice, development, and peace.    9. We would like to know why the federal government's  goodwill, the protracted negotiations, the months that have gone  by, the government's flexibility, and its genuine recognition of  the unfair social realities that infuriate us all have proven  insufficient.    10. We request that, in accordance with President Carlos  Salinas de Gortari's instructions, given yesterday, government  offices and institutions vigorously and generously implement  legal and institutional changes and a program that will increase  the wellbeing of people in Chiapas, especially in the  mountainous areas, and bring justice and spiritual peace to  their homes.    [Signed] CEN President Ignacio Pichardo Pagaza; CEN  Secretary  General Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu</p>

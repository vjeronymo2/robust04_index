			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Follow the leader DID YOU happen to see that leader in The Times last Monday entitled Chariots of Hope and Glory? It was a model of the leader-writer's art: pithy, uplifting and as fast off the blocks as its subject, British sprinter Linford Christie, the toast of Barcelona. 'Six hundredths of a second' - it started - 'are an infinitesimally short time for most sublunary activities . . . But this was the margin by which Linford Christie won the Olympic 100 metres at the weekend, an apparently leisurely stride and a half ahead of the other fastest men in the world from Africa and the Americas, straining and ducking towards the tape behind him in that far fierce split-second and sweet.' Sublunary means mundane or terrestrial. I had to look it up. I shall use it often now, though I doubt I will have the wit to use it as a launch-pad for the poeticism of 'far fierce split-second and sweet.' That was the first paragraph. But the writer did not rest on his laurels. He upped the ante, boosted the pace, showed a flash of character, answered the big question and was not found wanting. After 'far fierce split-second and sweet' he threw in a bit of business about Christie confessing as a child that he wanted to be the 'fastest man on earth' - a title, wrote The Times' unknown warrior, that derived from journalistic hyperbole. It had to be hyperbole because 'in miles per hour, the fastest man in the world is often the one running 200 metres . . . he is running at top speed for longer: the record for 200 metres is usually less than twice the time for the 100. Nevertheless, it the 100 metres that is the cynosure of athletics . . .' From there, the leader moved towards its climax with utmost panache: 'To run faster than all comers' - it concluded - 'glorifies not just the runner and his country, but humanity itself. That is why those six hundredths of a second make even the most unathletic walk with a spring in their strides this morning.' I don't expect that you know any newspaper leader-writers. They are invariably quite small men - 5ft 3in is rare - who wear waistcoats and spectacles and live in pretty suburbs. Most are over-educated. Also introverted and combative. They are combative because they know that the only people who read newspaper leaders are the people who write them. This is not as it should be. The reason I say this is that I am a director of a small London company that supplies leader-columns to newspapers on a freelance basis. The work is arduous and ill-paid, but the Olympics are a god-send. Yesterday, for example, I sat at the word processor and bent my mind to the Olympic medals table. 'In the fiery cauldron of the Olympic stadium' - I started - 'all men and nations are equal. Whether you are a pampered American track star with hand-tooled luggage and a syringe in your pocket, or an uncalculating tribesman from the ancestral plains of Africa, all are equal before the judges. This also applies to nations. At the top of the medal list this morning sit the Unified Team of former communists with 88 medals, followed by the US (86) and Germany (58). These are big-spending teams with a lust for winning. But that does not make them greater in spirit or in pride than little nations with just a bronze medal each: the Bahamas, Columbia, Ethiopia, Iran, Malaysia, Mongolia, Surinam.' That was going well, so I called an assistant to finish it off and sat at another screen: 'It is a mark of the crumbling of Britain's class system that a golden Essex Girl like Sally Gunnell should have captured the hearts of the global billions with a magnificent display of courage in the Olympic women's 400 metres hurdles. Not for Sally Gunnell the lip-gloss contracts of glamorous rivals like America's Sandra Farmer-Patrick, whom she slew on the burning track. Sally is the face of John Major's Britain. She is modest yet determined. Reassuringly plain. In her own word: 'Brilliant']' I rushed to another screen: 'South Africa could explode at any moment, which means that the South African Olympic team in Barcelona could be reduced to the status of refugees. Who will give them sanctuary? Who will offer succour?' I called for an assistant. I would not rest on my laurels. It was time to raise the stakes, to show a flash of character, to answer the big question and burst through the pain wall.</p>

			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / Jobseeker benefit deal 'a shambles' The departments of employment and social security have reached a compromise over the administration of the new Jobseeker's Allowance. After months of wrangling it was announced yesterday that the allowance will be jointly operated by the Employment Service, a Department of Employment agency; and the Benefits Agency, which comes under the social security department. Mr Frank Field, Labour chairman of the Commons social security committee, attacked the deal as a 'shambles' and 'the worst of all possible fudges'. The announcement, which unions warned could result in at least 3,000 job losses, ends weeks of speculation over which department would take responsibility for the new benefit, which replaces unemployment benefit. Under the deal, the Employment Service will be responsible for advice and tests such as availability for work. Financial aspects, including the calculation and payment of the benefit, will be the responsibility of the Benefits Agency. It had been feared that the transfer of the allowance to the DSS might have weakened the employment department at a time when its future as an independent department is under discussion. Mr Field said the arrangement 'couldn't be more unsatisfactory'. It would have been better, he said, if one department had disbursed all benefits and at the same time had been responsible for running the job clubs, which are government-run centres for job seekers. The allowance, to be introduced in April 1996, will be paid for only six months, compared with the one year for unemployment benefit. Subsequent benefits will be means-tested and there will be a greater obligation upon the individual to seek work. Mr Donald Dewar, shadow social security secretary, said the reorganisation of services for the unemployed was 'wrong in principle and damaging in practice'.</p>

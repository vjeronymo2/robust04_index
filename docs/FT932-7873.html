			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Technology: Making life easier for the tellers - Worth Watching The latest object-oriented software has been adopted by computer maker Siemens Nixdorf Information Systems to make it easier for tellers in banks and building societies to carry out transactions and sell extra services to their customers. Each customer becomes a single 'object' on the system, and attached to each are details of accounts, mortgages and other business with the bank. Information on SN-teller can be displayed and entered using a mouse and operating in the Windows environment, or in a keyboard format running under Dos, OS/2 or Unix. Siemens Nixdorf: UK, 0344 862222. Siemens Nixdorf, AST and IBM have all announced the launch of PCs based on the latest, and most powerful, Intel microprocessor, the Pentium. IBM has also developed a means of upgrading older PS/2 machines with a Pentium processor. AST: UK, 081 568 4350. IBM: UK, 0705 321212.</p>

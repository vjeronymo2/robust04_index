			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / International Company News: Airlines alliance 'may boost revenues by Dollars 400m' CONTINENTAL Airlines, the fifth-largest US carrier, and Air Canada yesterday predicted that the alliance between them could generate an additional Dollars 400m of revenues annually, once a US-Canada 'open skies' deal is agreed. The forecast was made by Mr Hollis Harris, Air Canada's chairman, at a joint press conference in New York called to herald Continental's re-emergence from bankruptcy on Tuesday night. The last step in Continental's reorganisation was completed then, when the carrier closed an investment agreement with Air Canada and Air Partners, a Texan investment group. This deal gives the investors a 55 per cent stake in Continental. It is two-and-a-half years since Houston-based Continental sought protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the US Bankruptcy Code. Continental went in and out of bankruptcy once before, during the early-1980s. The increase in revenue, Mr Harris suggested, could translate into a Dollars 25m increase in earnings for Air Canada, and something similar for Continental - although he did not elaborate. The carriers stressed yesterday that, while they do not anticipate any 'common branding' at this stage (flying under common colours, for example), they are seeking cost savings through shared maintainence services and similar moves. Air Canada has relocated gates at La Guardia airport in New York, to be nearer Continental, and plans to move to the Continental terminal at Newark. Air Canada is also launching two daily Toronto-Houston flights next month. Houston is Continental's chief hub, and this is designed to improve customer feed. Meanwhile, Mr Harris said the company had made 'no final recommendation' to directors on whether its 9 per cent stake in Ireland's GPA group should be written down. However, it will do so ahead of the board meeting on May 6. The larger US carriers have complained bitterly about 'unfair' competition from bankrupt airlines, who get relief from debt payments and some other operating advantages. Continental's emergence leaves America West and TWA as two remaining US carriers operating under Chapter 11 protection.</p>

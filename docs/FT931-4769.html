			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Vickers falls The return of speculation that engineering group Vickers will make a rights issue when it announces figures tomorrow depressed the shares. At the day's worst they were down 9 at 114p, with many market watchers increasingly convinced that such a move was imminent. Later in the day, the strong market trend helped to bring about a rally and the stock closed 4 off at 119p on trade of 2.8m. Mr Andy Chambers at Nomura said a rights issue from Vickers 'would not be surprising, given the damage to the balance sheet wrought by the losses at the Rolls-Royce subsidiary'. The range of losses forecast by analysts varies between Pounds 12m and Pounds 25m. Some slightly worrying figures on oil comsumption in OECD countries during January failed to head off yet another good performance by the oil sector. Shell managed an improvement of 4 at 578p in spite of a 'sell' recommendation issued by NatWest Securities. The exploration and production stocks continued to drive ahead strongly, with Enterprise up 9 more to 497p and Lasmo 6 higher at 191p. Confirmation that the Barclays chairman and chief executive Mr Andrew Buxton is to pass on some of his responsibilities to a new senior executive later this year, plus a growing feeling in the market that the shares have ridden out the storm caused by the dividend cut, promoted a good rally yesterday. The stock price was up and running from the outset, and shrugged off attempted profit-taking and selling pressure to close the session a net 13 ahead at 421p - only 12 short of the level at which the shares were changing hands before the dividend reduction. Turnover totalled 7m. National Westminster also made strong progress and moved up 17 to 454p on relatively thin turnover of 3.2m. Lloyds, viewed by many fund managers as the safest bet in the sector, rose 7 to 559p on 5.5m traded. A series of outstanding performances by Standard Chartered shares was dented by worries about the bank's losses arising from the Bombay securities market scandal last April. Standard Chartered is one of four big international banks said to have been most actively involved in the Indian market. Standard is scheduled to report preliminary figures tomorrow, with NatWest Securities forecasting pre-tax profits of Pounds 280m, against Pounds 205m last time. Standard shares settled 9 off at 699p after higher than usual turnover of 1.6m. Insurance broker Willis Corroon gained 7 at 194p, with dealers saying that the shares now fully discount a cut in the dividend, due to be announced tomorrow. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew was said to have been behind the latest selling pressure in the regional electricity companies. Midland, 10 down at 499p, and East Midland, 8 1/2 lower at 456 1/2 p, were the poorest performers in the sector. Favourable results are expected from several of the large international stocks this week. BAT Industries, which reports tomorrow, climbed 15 to 950p, while BTR, with results the following day, rose 6 to 590p. Figures from British Vita, the foam manufacturer, proved disappointing and the shares retreated amid a welter of downgrades to finish 18 weaker at 235p. After its recent run, ICI ran into profit-taking and closed 5 adrift at 1240p. So did Thorn EMI, which slipped 10 to 864p. A 19.3 per cent increase in figures at Fairey helped the shares put on 10 at 590p. General investment buying of Siebe saw the stock close 11 better at 499p. Also wanted, ahead of figures on Thursday, was TI Group, 6 up at 311p. The strong market trend assisted Rolls-Royce in shrugging off worries about the dividend, when it reports full year figures on Thursday. The shares firmed 2 to 136p, with turnover of 4m recorded in the stock by the close. Many analysts have suggested that the company is likely to halve the final dividend, with the more pessimistic ones predicting a bigger reduction. In motors, the recent news of an improvement in UK car sales continued to boost Thomas Cowie, which added 9 at 225p. Profit-taking restricted Associated British Food, 2 easier at 507p. The stock has been recommended by brokers recently on the back of restructuring in the bakery industry. Buying in Amsterdam and continued US interest sustained Unilever's good post-results run. The shares climbed 21 to 1238p. Weekend press comment raked up further worries over the managerial changes at Tate &amp; Lyle and the stock dipped 4 to 428p. Relief over the results from Perkins Foods, together with some favourable comments about the outlook for produce prices, lifted the shares 7 to 105p. In a muted stores sector, Body Shop reacted to talk of devaluation benefits and the shares added 10 at 185p. Electronic components group Bowthorpe appreciated 6 to 294p, responding to an aggressive buy note published by Hoare Govett, the stockbroking house. Mr James Heal at Hoare said he expected Bowthorpe to move into a new 'niche' business - electronic subsystems - which he forecasts could boost earnings growth by 5 per cent over the next three years.</p>

I. Lyakhov, Institute of Control Problems; </F> UDC 689.324:519.248]    [Abstract] This article examines and analyzes a closed  exponential network of queues of large dimension with several  classes of calls. This network, which includes finite sources of  calls of every class and a set of one-channel devices, is a  generalized model of inhomogeneous multiprocessor systems with a  completely connected interface, as well as a generalized model  of multiterminal systems with external memory. The Laplace  method is used to prove a system of assertions which define and  validate asymptotic approximations for basic stationary  characteristics of the model for a rather broad set of cases of  load distributions among the servicing devices in the network.  This is in contrast to previous papers where asymptotic  approximations with a predetermined accuracy were obtained only  for cases of a single class of calls or a small load on all  (finite) one-channel devices. The simple form of the  approximations makes it possible to guarantee accuracy and  quickly obtain a solution to the problem of evaluating the  performance of multiprocessor and multi-terminal systems.

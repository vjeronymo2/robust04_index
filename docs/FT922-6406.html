			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / Summer sun shines on Perot: Bush struggles with economy, Clinton struggles to be heard THE Memorial Day holiday on Monday marks the official start of America's summer. But this one only brings warmth to the most unlikely presidential aspirant of this or any other year, the billionaire from Texas, Mr H Ross Perot. A poll out yesterday said he had a good chance of winning in November. The CNN-USA Today survey gave him and President George Bush 35 per cent each and Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas 25 per cent. Perversely, it also found that only one in five surveyed thought Mr Perot would actually become the next president. Recent opinion polls have settled down to a pattern with either Mr Perot or Mr Bush in the lead and the likely Democratic nominee third, with the gap usually in single figures. But a pattern is emerging in the polls, with Mr Bush seen as the strongest only on conservative social policy issues such as law and order and either Mr Clinton or Mr Perot ahead in the perception of their abilities to handle every other domestic and economic problem. This gives the lie - at least temporarily - to the widely held belief that an improving economy will come to the president's rescue in the end. In fact the recovery remains generally weak and regionally spotty, explaining, for example, Mr Bush's weakness in the west, where the economy lags. The Arkansas governor's current problem is that although he is on the verge of securing his party's nomination he has virtually disappeared from the media. Given the critical scrutiny accorded Mr Clinton earlier, he might have welcomed this relief. But the inability to make the public aware of policies he would implement to stop inner cities erupting again has left him marginalised. Yesterday he did secure a national television interview. He castigated administration social policies, and described Mr Perot as 'a brilliant sound bite politician', adding 'people don't know what he would do, but they think they know what he stands for and it sounds good to them.' Mr Clinton insisted that he and Mr Perot agreed on many issues, perhaps because they were born only 35 miles apart. But, having campaigned as the candidate of 'change', he senses Mr Perot is stealing his clothes. 'It's harder for me to make that case because I've been a governor and an elected official,' he said. 'I've got to show I've got a record of actually doing some of the things Mr Perot is talking about.' This explicitly recognises the reason for Mr Perot's current strength - a great lack of public confidence in the ability of the conventional political system to deliver the economic and social goods. If Mr Perot is vulnerable, it will probably be on his record as a ruthless tycoon intolerant of dissent and always willing to cut corners to achieve an end. Meanwhile Mr Clinton struggles to be heard and Mr Bush lets Mr Quayle preach the older doctrines of conservatism. It promises to be a long, hot summer of political discontent.</p>

			<p><P> August 11, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: GANG MEMBER GETS 31 YEARS TO LIFE IN 'SWEET 16'  PARTY SLAYING  </P> <P> A 24-year-old Lake View Terrace gang member was sentenced Thursday to 31 years  to life in prison for the murder of the chaperon at a "sweet 16" party.  </P> <P> San Fernando Superior Court Judge Ronald Coen imposed the sentence on Jeffrey  Evans, 24, after denying his lawyer's motion for a new trial.  </P> <P> Evans and John Tanner, 23, also of Lake View Terrace, were convicted last month  of murdering John Shaw, 23, who was shot to death on the front lawn of a house  in Sylmar where the party was being held. Tanner is to be sentenced today.  </P> <P> During the eight-week trial, Deputy Dist. Atty. Edward Nison argued that  Tanner, Evans, and Dennis Elliot, 24, of Pacoima, approached Shaw as he stood  with other guests in front of the home in the 14900 block of Aztec Street.  Evans was said to have asked the party-goers if they were affiliated with  gangs. Shaw replied that he was not. Tanner interpreted that as a slight and  shot Shaw in the back, Nison said.  </P> <P> Elliot was acquitted of the murder charges. However the jury found him guilty  of attempted murder for his role in a drive-by shooting earlier that night.  Four shots were fired at Cedric Finley, 20, of Pacoima. Finley was unhurt.  </P> <P> Coen sentenced Elliot on Thursday to 15 years in state prison. Lawyers for  Evans and Elliot said they will seek a new trial, claiming that their clients  were convicted on insufficient evidence.  </P></p>

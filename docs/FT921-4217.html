			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / Sunday trade ruling reserved THE House of Lords has reserved judgment on an appeal over the powers of local authorities in England and Wales to enforce Sunday trading laws. The decision is not expected before next month. Kirklees Borough Council, West Yorkshire, backed by attorney general Sir Patrick Mayhew, hopes to overturn a Court of Appeal ruling which made Sunday trading restrictions virtually unenforceable. A European Court ruling on the validity of Sunday trading laws in England and Wales under European Community law is expected later this year. The Kirklees appeal concerns whether local authorities, seeking court injunctions banning Sunday trading, must indemnify retailers for loss of Sunday profits in the event of the European Court upholding the traders' position.</p>

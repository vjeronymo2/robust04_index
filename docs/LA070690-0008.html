			<p><P> July 6, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'WINNER TAKE ALL' IS NOT A JUST ANSWER;  </P> <P> SOUTH AFRICA: PROTECTION OF MINORITIES DOES NOT MEAN PROTECTION OF PRIVILEGE.  IT DOES MEAN PROTECTION AGAINST THE ABUSE OF POWER BY THE MAJORITY.  </P> <P> Regardless of what other people say, I believe that sanctions per se are not  the main problem in South Africa. Our prime concern is the domestic situation  -- that is, the process of negotiation with all South Africans for a better  future and the need for improvement of the quality of life for all.  </P> <P> Insofar as sanctions against South Africa exist, we are living with them. What  they have done, however, is retard our ability to fulfill our commitment to  redress social and other backlogs in an imaginative way and on a sufficiently  large scale. Should the international community re-evaluate its position on  sanctions, it would allow us to harness our country's resources and face our  challenges effectively, both inside South Africa and in the whole subcontinent  -- challenges that can best be met by a vibrant South African economy.  </P> <P> We disagree with the African National Congress' anachronistic emphasis on  nationalization of industry, which it sees as the guarantee of a redistribution  of wealth. We believe that a free-enterprise economy is the key to economic  progress in the future. It is a proven system capable of generating new wealth  and new opportunities, as is evidenced in the progress of the industrialized  nations that adhere to it.  </P> <P> In South Africa, unfortunately, this system is seen by many as synonymous with  apartheid. In their rejection of apartheid, many would then equally, and  mistakenly, equate a centrally controlled economy with economic progress. These  are links that must be broken.  </P> <P> My greatest hope is to bring about a just and fair South Africa by peaceful  means. The greatest trap would be that radicalism and escalating conflict get  out of hand. While firmly and fairly maintaining law and order, we must  therefore strive for consensus, lifting our gaze above the many stumbling  blocks presented by self-interest, exaggerated expectations and fear.  </P> <P> In this endeavor, I believe I can work with Nelson Mandela. I believe I can  work with him and other leaders in negotiating a new constitution for our  country on the basis of give and take. I have seen Mandela keep his word after  discussions with me. I perceive him to be a man who prefers peace to violence.  He is a friendly and dignified man.  </P> <P> There is no doubt in my mind that the overwhelming majority of South Africans  are in favor of the kind of peaceful change I would like to bring about with  the help of Mandela and other leaders with a proven support base. The mere fact  that I could sit down with an ANC delegation earlier this year, I think,  testifies to the will of the South Africans to give peace a chance.  </P> <P> I believe that, on the black side of politics, there is a growing acceptance --  even among those who used violence as a method of policy -- of the government's  integrity in negotiating a common future. The time of violent confrontation is  past. All of us share some common ground in realizing that peace is the only  option.  </P> <P> Once the negotiation process has gained momentum -- and the government is eager  for this process to start as soon as possible -- the search for consensus will  replace polarization.  </P> <P> We now want to work out a just and equitable system for all, but at the same  time make sure that those who have enjoyed full freedoms do not forfeit them.  That is why the National Party repeatedly emphasizes, in addition to universal  franchise, the principle of nondomination and the protection of the rights and  interests of minorities.  </P> <P> Franchise on a common voters' roll in an otherwise undifferentiated and  unqualified system of political representation must lead inevitably to majority  domination of minorities. History has ample examples of the tension,  frustration and conflict that unavoidably go together with the domination of  closely knit minority groups.  </P> <P> A constitutional system based on the "winner-take-all" approach is therefore  not the answer to South Africa's complexities. It does not provide for adequate  protection of minorities, nor for the cultural, religious and language  differences among South Africans. However, universal adult franchise within a  system into which constitutional mechanisms of protection are built is indeed  an achievable possibility.  </P> <P> One would be mistaken to draw from this a plea against the majority of the  country's population getting their due. The whole argument now centers around  unqualified majority rule without the balance of protection for minorities.  Protection of minorities, I hasten to add, does not mean protection of  privilege nor continuation of domination by a minority. It does, however, mean  protection against the abuse of power by the majority.  </P> <P> To repeat, I am in favor of universal adult franchise within a constitutional  dispensation based on the principle of nondomination and into which most of  these mechanisms are built: the decentralization of power, the devolution of  authority to lower levels, constitutional checks and balances, decision-making  by consensus and an independent judiciary. In addition, I stand for a bill of  rights. Taken together, these elements will pave the path to a fair and just  South Africa.  </P></p>

Deputy Premier Valeriy Shmarov also confirmed that Ukraine  had already removed 17 of the 46 modern SS-24 missiles it  possesses from their silos and had disconnected their nuclear  warheads. Each has 10 warheads.    Shmarov, the government's point man on nuclear disarmament,  told AFP the United States had proposed that Ukraine receive  free fuel for its nuclear power stations for the next five years  as compensation for giving up the 176 strategic missiles it  possesses.    "This is a big step by all sides towards reaching a  compromise," Shmarov said.    He stated that the United States had also proposed that  Ukraine's estimated two billion-dollar debt to Russia for energy  supplies be erased to compensate for the smaller tactical  nuclear weapons withdrawn from Ukrainian territory by May 1992.    Shmarov said Russia had agreed to the scheme. Russian  officials declined to comment.    He said that within 10 days another three SS-24s will have  been deactivated as a "goodwill gesture" by Ukraine.    Shmarov stated that Kiev may consider the deactivated SS-24s  as among the missiles it agreed to get rid of under its  qualified ratification of the 1991 START treaty.    "We retain the view that the missiles representing the  biggest ecological danger must be destroyed first," Shmarov  said, referring to 130 older SS-19 long-range missiles.    Ukraine signed agreements last year in which it pledged to  respect the START treaty, accede to the Nuclear  Non-Proliferation Treaty and get rid of all the nuclear weapons  on its soil.    The Ukrainian parliament however ratified START earlier this  year with the stipulation that it only applied to 42 percent of  the 176 strategic nuclear missiles from the former Soviet  arsenal based in the country.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Litomysl, East Bohemia, April 5 (CTK) -- President  Vaclav Havel is staying at his private residence outside Prague  to recover from a virus infection complicated by pneumonia.    Presidential spokesman Ladislav Spacek said the president  was  trying to get better in time for the meeting of Central European  presidents taking place here April 15-16.    Spacek said the president was recovering as expected and had  canceled all his plans in order to ensure he recovered  completely. His participation in the presidential summit,  however, depends on several medical tests which are still being  run.</p>

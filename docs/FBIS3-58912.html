At the recent NATO summit, it was agreed that the Alliance  presence in Europe should be bolstered and, in this context, the  partners discussed the possibility that the Western European  Union [WEU] might conduct military operations, using NATO  logistical support, he continued. This could provide an element  of flexibility whereby the Europeans could resort to the use of  force in a particular situation, without automatically involving  the United States, he explained.    The minister went on to discuss the possibility of  projecting  the Alliance farther into the Mediterranean both in terms of a  formal extension of the partnership to other nations in the  region, and in terms of cooperation between the WEU and friendly  nations such as Egypt or Morocco, always within the NATO  framework.    At present, this would be a dangerous hypothesis, but if the  Mideast peace process goes forward it could be seen as a  possible development, Andreatta said.    Moving on to matters of development cooperation, Andreatta  said that the fundamental problem was the study of technologies  more suitable to nations of the south and to their transfer.</p>

After he  completed law studies in Prague and Bratislava he lectured at  the School of Economics and worked shortly at the Bratislava  Chemapol chemical company.    Since 1972 he lectured at the Faculty of Law of Komensky  University in Bratislava. In the years 1990-91 he was its dean.  In January 1991 Moravcik filled a vacant seat in the Slovak  National Counil (parliament) representing the Public Against  Violence (VPN) movement. When the VPN split in 1991 he joined  the HZDS [Movement for a Democratic Slovakia]. From April to  June 1992 he was a member of the Slovak National Council  presidium.    In the June 1992 elections Moravcik was elected an HZDS  deputy to the House of the People of the Federal Assembly  (parliament) and in July he was appointed federal foreign  minister. He held the post until December 1992 when the  Czechoslovak Federation ceased to exist. In 1993 he became a  legislative adviser to Slovak Premier Vladimir Meciar. He was  appointed Slovak foreign minister on March 19, 1993, to replace  Milan Knazko (then HZDS) who was fired after long-term disputes  with Meciar. [passage omitted]    Moravcik made clear his opinion that a political structure  compatible with the political structure common in Western Europe  should be created in Slovakia. He warned that the HZDS did not  have a partner in the West and said this was "a certain  handicap." He also claimed he sympathized with the social  democratic orientation.</p>

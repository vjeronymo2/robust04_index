			<p><P> August 14, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Drexel to Pay Arkansas Fine: Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. has agreed to pay a  $100,000 fine to the Arkansas Securities Department even though the government  said it has no evidence that the firm did anything wrong in the state. The  consent order stems from the possibility that Drexel's Beverly Hills junk bond  department might have committed improper trades in Arkansas from 1984 through  1986. Drexel said it would pay the $100,000 even though it hasn't had an office  in Arkansas for four or five years.  </P></p>

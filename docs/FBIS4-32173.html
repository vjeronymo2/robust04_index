			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, June 20 (CTK) -- The present Slovak  Government will sign a basic treaty with Hungary if it can be  signed, and will not wait for the autumn parliamentary  elections, Foreign Minister Eduard Kukan said today. Speaking  at a press conference after a meeting with his Czech counterpart  Josef Zieleniec, Kukan said there existed positive signs that  the treaty would be concluded. The key points of the treaty are  recognition of the existing border and guarantees of ethnic  minorities.    The treaty has been under preparation for a long time now,  but the minority policy of the former government of Vladimir  Meciar and some stands on the same question of the previous  Hungarian government had not allowed its signature. "We have  already been preparing the text of the treaty and I believe that  talks on it will start immediately after the (new) Hungarian  government starts functioning," Kukan said.    Kukan and Zieleniec today signed an addendum to the October  29, 1992 Czech-Slovak agreement abolishing the visa duty. The  addendum brings the border and customs regime on the Czech-  Slovak border closer to European standards. It allows citizens  from third countries to cross the Czech-Slovak border at  specified crossings which is to allow better control of  migration. Kukan also met today Chairman of the Czech  parliament Milan Uhde.</p>

			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / Observer: Bubbles Is the Veuve Clicquot Business Woman of the Year award in danger of losing its fizz? After 21 years of boosting female executives, it's beginning to look almost as accident-prone as the now defunct Guardian Young Businessman of the Year scheme. Remember Sir Clive Sinclair, John Gunn of British and Commonwealth and John Ashcroft of Coloroll? They got their GYB gongs and then fell flat on their faces. The casualty rate among the bubbly businesswomen of the year is not quite as high but it's starting to cause some concern. Mair Barnes (1988 winner) resigned all of a sudden in February after seven good years as managing director of Woolworths. Other honourable mentions go to Debbie Moore (1983), whose Pineapple empire called in the receivers last year owing upwards of Pounds 1m, and Sophie Mirman (1987), founder of Sock Shop, who emerged from the attentions of administrators with only a small children's wear chain. But top marks surely go to Ann Iverson, who made it to the short list of five for the 1993 awards, to be presented today. With cavalier disregard for the champagne-maker's feelings, Iverson chucked in her job at Mothercare earlier this week.</p>

			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / Observer: Pen pal Yukio Sato, president of Yamaichi Bank in Switzerland, is laudably unsentimental about the panoply of Japanese vases and lacquerware lining his shelves. In fact, he would like to call a halt to the collection now, and with it the age-old bond market ritual whereby investment bank and borrower exchange lavish gifts at the signing ceremony after the completion of an issue. Last month, he secured the co-operation of Pigeon Corp, a Japanese baby-care products group, to waive the gifts and to join Yamachi in a donation to the Swiss Red Cross instead. Last week, Goldwin, a Japanese sportswear maker, followed suit. Sato says he can still see a purpose in bestowing prezzies on a first-time client, but from now on will try to push repeat issuers down the charitable route. Only snag is, with heart-warming ideas like these, has Yamaichi kissed good-bye to the notion of winning a mandate from Vendome, makers of those posh Mont Blanc pens?</p>

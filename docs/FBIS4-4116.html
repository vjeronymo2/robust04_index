			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 27 KYODO -- China on Wednesday [27  April] denied a foreign report that paramount leader Deng  Xiaoping is in intensive care at a military hospital.    A Foreign Ministry official said the report is a complete  fabrication. "Comrade Deng is in very good heath," said the  official who declined to be identified.    South Korea's SEGYE TIMES [SEGYE ILBO] reported Wednesday  that Deng has been hospitalized and is in critical condition.    The Seoul daily said in a front-page story that rumors are  circulating in Beijing about Deng's worsening health, and  possible death.</p>

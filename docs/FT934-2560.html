			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / The Russian Elections: West sees danger signs but puts on brave face The German government yesterday put a brave face on the election results from Moscow, congratulating both 'the Russian people and President Boris Yeltsin on the good result for the new constitution'. There was obvious concern, however, over the big vote for both Russian nationalists and communists, with Mr Klaus Kinkel, foreign minister, admitting the result was 'surprising'. 'It shows that people were exploiting both social protest and doubtless also the identity crisis in Russia after the collapse of the Soviet Union,' Mr Kinkel said, reflecting an unease felt across western capitals at the poor performance of the reformist parties - a concern only partly tempered by relief at that Mr Yeltsin's constitution was adopted. As the news of the scale of the nationalist and communist vote trickled in, Scandinavian countries became the first to voice their alarm. Mr Johan Hoergen Holst, Norwegian foreign minister and potential future secretary general of Nato, warned that the results were a 'sign of danger' for many in Europe, with the progress of the nationalists 'very frightening'. Mr Carl Bildt, Swedish prime minister, said the results were 'disturbing', although he insisted that Russia's progress towards democracy was now 'unstoppable'. Meanwhile, Mr Thomas Pickering, US ambassador to Moscow warned the strong support given to Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky in the elections could provide a long-term political disruption to President Yeltsin, though the approval of his constitution had given Mr Yeltsin a 'legal basis to move ahead'. Mr Kinkel warned the result could slow Nato expansion, and Nato officials were wary. Uncertainties about its relationship with Russia were a factor in its decision to slow the pace of Nato expansion, they said. Finland and Japan, which have been the target of Mr Zhirinovsky's territorial claims, carefully maintained a muted reaction. Far-right parties in France and Germany sent a message of congratulations to Mr Zhirinovsky. With Mr Zhirinovsky's future role in any government still unclear, the hope in many diplomatic quarters is that the extremist statements made during his election campaign might be toned down in the aftermath of the election. Meanwhile the international money markets and western business community in Moscow remained philosophical. Businesses already operating in Moscow were accustomed to considerable uncertainty, businessmen said.</p>

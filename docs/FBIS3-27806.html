Corporal Kim Chol-chin and Private First Class Kim  Kyong-chol  of the Korean People's Security Forces have returned to the  bosom of the socialist fatherland through Panmunjom today. They  had their boat shipwrecked on the West Sea off Tungsangot in an  unexpected accident on 26 January. Drifting toward the South,  they were abducted by the enemy.    The South Korean puppets, instead of (?immediately)  returning  our men whom they took away with them, detained them, and  attempted to have them defect with all sorts of appeasement and  deception, but failed to bend the revolutionary fidelity and  will of the soldiers who had been brought up in the bosom of our  comrade supreme commander to be one-a-match-for-a hundred  soldiers.    Unable to resist the stubborn protest of the detained  soldiers and our side's repeated demand, they had to return them  to the northern half of the Republic.    According to the final agreement between the secretaries of  the two sides of the Military Armistice Commission, the soldiers  of the Korean People's Security Forces who fought among the  enemies sustaining the revolutionary faith came to the bosom of  the socialist fatherland crossing the Military Demarcation Line  proudly in military uniform at 1510 today. They reported in  high spirits to a Korean People's Army major general who came to  Panmunjom to greet them on their return to the bosom of comrade  supreme commander, and cried out, "Long live our supreme  commander Comrade Kim Chong-il."    At Panmunjom, the soldiers of the People's Army and the  working people of Kaesong warmly greeted them, offering them  bundles of flowers and hanging flower garlands on them. Then a  news conference was held at Tongilgak. They exposed that the  South Korean puppets employed all sorts of maneuvers to have  them defect. They said that they were able to return to the  bosom of the socialist fatherland thanks to our comrade supreme  commander and that they will become loyalists and dutiful  children protecting and defending comrade supreme commander by  making themselves guns and bombs.</p>

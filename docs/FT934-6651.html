			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / BCCI liquidators seek simpler deal Touche Ross, the liquidator to the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, is to push for a far simpler agreement on behalf of the failed bank's creditors with the government of Abu Dhabi, the majority shareholder in the bank. The new strategy is being developed following the surprise rejection on October 27 of previous proposals by the Luxembourg courts. Under the previous agreement negotiated with the liquidators, Abu Dhabi would have contributed up to Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.3bn), in exchange for a waiver of any legal action against it. However, the courts refused to ratify the agreement on the grounds that it did not treat all creditors equally and that it favoured Abu Dhabi above others. Any new offer is likely to exclude previous proposals to share the proceeds of any litigation with Abu Dhabi or allow it to offset its debts to BCCI against the money it is owed by the bank. In a statement yesterday the liquidators said they would pursue a number of 'parallel strategies'. The statement said: 'In particular, the liquidators intend to seek to re-establish a dialogue with Abu Dhabi with a view to determining whether any new plan can be developed for the benefit of BCCI creditors.' The statement follows meetings between liquidators to the bank around the world in the last few weeks, and discussions with its worldwide creditors' committee at the start of last week. The liquidators have more than two months to appeal, but it is thought unlikely that they will do so. They could also sue the government of Abu Dhabi. The government of Abu Dhabi said it was willing to help find a more equitable solution for creditors, but was unlikely to offer more money.</p>

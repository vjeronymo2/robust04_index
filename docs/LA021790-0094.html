			<p><P> February 17, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN SECTION GIRLS' SOCCER PLAYOFFS;  </P> <P> FOOTHILL UPSETS TRABUCO HILLS, 2-0  </P> <P> Capitalizing on teamwork, tough defense and perhaps its underdog status, the  Foothill High School girls' soccer team toppled Trabuco Hills, 2-0, in a  first-round 3-A playoff match Friday afternoon at Trabuco Hills High School.  </P> <P> Foothill (9-11-1), the third-place team in the Century League, scored two goals  midway through the first half, then managed to keep Trabuco Hills (18-5-1) from  scoring despite being outshot, 16-3, in the second half.  </P> <P> "Our whole intent was to take the game to them from the beginning, and we did  that in the first half," Foothill Coach Don Augustine said. "They came back in  the second half, but we held them. We had some lucky breaks, too. But hey, we  played hard as a team."  </P> <P> Especially at the start, which might have been the greatest difference in the  game. Unlike Foothill, Trabuco Hills, the Pacific Coast League champion and the  fifth-seeded team in the 3-A division, seemed to come out a bit slow.  </P> <P> Foothill took a 1-0 lead when captain Kathy Shortall fired in a left-footed  free kick from 30 yards out.  </P> <P> Sophomore Julie Borden scored Foothill's second goal from inside the penalty  box, despite the presence of several defenders, giving the Knights a 2-0 lead  going into halftime.  </P> <P> While Trabuco Hills dominated the second half, Foothill held strong, especially  in the game's final 10 minutes. Trabuco Hills had several shots on goal, most  of which were just inches away from scoring.  </P> <P> Along with Foothill goalkeeper Michelle Webb, who had 22 saves, halfback  Melanie Madole was praised by Augustine for defending Trabuco Hills' top  player, Linda Lunceford. Lunceford, a senior, is the county's second-leading  scorer this season with 31 goals.  </P> <P> "This was my first time ever (guarding Lunceford)," Madole said. "I heard she  was the No. 1 (actually No. 2) scorer in the county, so it made me a little  nervous. But it wasn't as hard as I thought it would be. She probably had an  off day."  </P> <P> Trabuco Hills Coach Mike Flanegian called it an off day for his entire team.  </P> <P> "If we played them again tomorrow, we'd win," Flanegian said. "If we played  them again next week, we'd win. If we played them again next month, we'd win.  This was an upset."  </P> <P> In other 3-A matches:  </P> <P> Laguna Hills 3, Kennedy 2 -- Monica Shrout scored in overtime for visiting  Laguna Hills (12-10-3). Kelly Besser and Crista Capshaw scored the other goals  for Laguna Hills and Claudia Smedes had all three assists. Kennedy ends at  15-5-1.  </P> <P> La Quinta 2, Bishop Montgomery 1 (OT) -- Stacey Reynaga scored in overtime for  La Quinta (16-3-1). Cheryl Jones scored in regulation for La Quinta.  </P> <P> Woodbridge 1, Moreno Valley 0 -- Lori Niles scored the game's only goal with an  assist from Tina Hall 12 minutes into the second half. Woodbridge is 13-5-2.  Moreno is 16-6-4. Michelle Helring had the shutout.  </P> <P> Redlands 3, Sunny Hills 1 (OT) -- Kelly Ward scored 77 minutes into the match  to tie it for host Sunny Hills (14-3-5). Redlands (13-4-6) scored once in each  overtime for the victory.  </P></p>

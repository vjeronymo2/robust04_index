			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Building societies face cash pressure Fierce competition for personal customers' savings contributed to a net outflow of Pounds 121m of building society funds last month. Figures released yesterday by the Building Societies Association also highlighted the pressure that societies are under in the mortgage market. Net advances last year totalled Pounds 9.4bn, compared with Pounds 13.5bn in 1992 - indicating a loss of market share to the banks, whose fixed-rate mortgages have proved popular. Mr Adrian Coles, director-general of the association, said that with interest rates expected to remain at or below their present levels in the coming year, the intense competition for savings looked set to continue. The figures showed an outflow for the second month running, following the Pounds 400m net outflow in November. It is only the second recorded outflow in December. Last year societies recorded a net inflow of Pounds 2.2bn - a significant advance on the 1992 figure of Pounds 295m but well below the levels of recent years. Societies are expected to step up their efforts to keep customers' savings through products such as unit trusts over the coming months, even where this could mean a shift from their own deposit accounts. During the year there was an increase in retail funds of Pounds 10.7bn because of interest credited to savers which was left in their accounts. Mr Coles emphasised that societies would warmly welcome the government's decision to review the 40 per cent limit on the proportion of funds which societies can raise from the wholesale markets. The announcement of a review of societies legislation, which will include an examination of the wholesale funding limit, came on Thursday  - as the government gave details of its guaranteed income bond for pensioners. Societies expect some outflow of funds from savers eligible for the new product. Net advances last month were Pounds 624m compared with Pounds 880m in November, while net new commitments fell to Pounds 2.1bn last month from Pounds 2.8bn the previous month. Mr Coles said that the downturn last month reflected a 'normal seasonal dip in activity around the turn of the year'. In 1992, however, there was much less difference between the November and December figures. Weekend, Page III</p>

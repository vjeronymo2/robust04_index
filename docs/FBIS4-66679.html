			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Hemant Sharma: "Kanshi Ram Is Extending His </F> Influence Amongst Backwards and Muslims"; all quotations marks  as published]    [Text] Kanpur, 6 April. After having the Dalits on his  side, Kanshi Ram is trying to expand his base among other  backward castes and the Muslims. The Kushwaha and Muslim  conference on Tuesday in Kanpur was part of this effort. Kanshi  Ram's cunning strategy is to steal away Mulayam Singh's support  base. However, Kanshi Ram has taken this initiative in order to  be able to form a government in U.P. [Uttar Pradesh] on his own.  Kanshi Ram argues that the Dalits, backwards, and Muslims make  up 90 percent of the country's total population. If they united,  then the 10 percent high caste people would not have any clout.    Kanshi Ram is playing his "backward" card to attract the  other backward castes. He made this an issue in yesterday's  meeting. Kanshi Ram said that the backwards make up 52 percent  of the population, however, their share in the nation's  government and administration is only three percent. Every  leader who had played the backward politics, has deceived them.    Kanshi Ram sang this same song until late that night in the  Chaman Ganj area. In this meeting, organized by the Indian  Islamic Organization, Kanshi Ram said, "The Brahman group is  responsible for the injustice against the Muslims. If you join  the Dalits, no power can rule you." Kanshi Ram said that the  lower castes and Muslims have united in Kanpur for elections.  Until now, the Brahman forces have been using them [Dalits] for  causing riots so that some of them die and the Brahmans could  benefit.    Not many Muslims came to hear Kanshi Ram in this  Muslim-majority area. The speeches were very hot, excited, and  dramatic in this meeting attended by about 2,000-2,500 people.  Amidst the "Allah-ho Akbar" slogans, it was said, "Neither a  court nor a government can make decisions on the Babri Masjid.  We are strong. If we have the authority, we will build the  mosque there." Maulana Habib-ul Rehman Ludhianvi said in Kanshi  Ram's presence, "The friendship between the Dalits and the  Muslims is very old." Later, Maulana also advised Kanshi Ram to  convert to Islam.    Calling Kanshi Ram the greatest supporter of the Muslims,  Kanpur's leading Muslim Maulana Abdul Baqi appealed to the  Muslims to follow Kanshi Ram. This meeting was held through the  efforts of Masaud Ahmed, the state minister for education. In  order to make sure that only the BSP [Bahujan Samaj Party]  benefits from this meeting, Mulayam Singh was not invited  despite great efforts by the SP [Samajwadi Party] people. Even  Mulayam Singh's name was not mentioned in this meeting. Kanshi  Ram and the BSP were called the real saviors of the Muslims in  this meeting. It was said that Kanshi Ram provided 96 vidhan  sabha and 21 Lok Sabha seats to the Muslims in the 1989  election. The numbers for the 1991 election were 105 and 22  respectively. No other party has ever given so many tickets to  the Muslims. In the 1993 vidhan sabha elections, the Congress  gave Muslims 26 out of 425 tickets, the Janata Dal 29 out of  375, and the Samajwadi Party gave 36 out of 265 tickets to the  Muslims. However, Kanshi Ram gave 49 out of 167 tickets to the  Muslims. Therefore, only Kanshi Ram can be the answer to the  problems of Muslims.    Kanshi Ram said that the Muslims were in a dilemma during  the  recent election. They were not with Mulayam Singh, however. They  were joining him [Kanshi Ram] now because he had called more  than 40 meetings "to encourage brotherhood." The BSP people have  travelled on bicycles to improve relations. That is why the  Muslims are not taking part in riots happening in the western  and northern parts of the state. The government has abused the  Muslims. Mansoor Khan, the state's education minister, appealed  to the Muslims, "You have seen them all. Now give two months to  Kanshi Ram. All your problems will be resolved."    In the Kushwaha Mahasabha meeting, Kanshi Ram told the same  things to other backward groups. He said, "This is your  condition today. You are the majority among the backward castes,  but you have no part in administration or the government. You  are misled during the elections. You support the Janata Dal, the  Congress Party, and the BJP one after another. The partnership  of the backward castes in Uttar Pradesh government is less than  that even of the Dalits. It has been 64 years since the Round  Table conference was held, and 45 years since we got  independence. However, the backward castes have not received  their share yet."    Kanshi Ram refered to the IAS [Indian Administrative  Service]  to impress this fact on the backwards saying, "There are 550 IAS  officers in U.P. and only seven of them are from backward  classes. The Dalits trusted Dr. Ambedekar and listened to him.  That is why there are 112 officers from the Dalit group. The  backward castes are 50 years behind the Dalits now. They must  think now and the whole Bahujan Samaj will have to fight as a  group."    Kanshi Ram refuses to admit that he is trying to cut his  associate Mulayam Singh's support base. He said, "I am just  uniting the BSP." However, many SP leaders did join the BSP in  the Kushwaha conference. High state officials along with several  hundred cars with blue and red lights were there to protect  Kanshi Ram.</p>

			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / BR chairman warns on sell-off plans SIR BOB REID, chairman of British Rail, warned yesterday that 'major questions' over the proposed privatisation of the railways were in danger of disrupting the government's plans. The timetable for privatisation was very tight, he said, and serious obstacles remained to be overcome. 'Until I am absolutely satisfied that we have got a workable proposition, we don't go,' he told MPs. The government is planning to introduce the privatisation legislation by the end of this month. It hopes to have the framework in place by April 1994 if Royal Assent follows next summer. Sir Bob told the Commons transport committee that the government had yet to publish its plans for the single most important element of privatisation - the system of charging train operators for use of the railway tracks. He also voiced his concern over the lack of any clear-cut plans for investment in new rolling stock immediately after privatisation, since private-sector operators would be unlikely to risk investing in trains until they had built up experience. He also warned against excessive bureaucracy.</p>

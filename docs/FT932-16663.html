			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / Change in courts may save Pounds 100m A GOVERNMENT committee has suggested ways to make substantial savings by reducing the number of cases that are tried in crown courts. A paper by the criminal justice consultative committee highlights the Home Office estimate that up to Pounds 100m a year could be saved if magistrates' courts dealt with all the cases where the sentences finally passed in the crown court were within magistrates' powers. The document, drawn up by a group of senior figures from different parts of the criminal justice system, says that there could be 'significant' savings in court spending, legal aid, and the police and prison services if magistrates' courts took more cases. Suggestions in the discussion paper are aimed at magistrates, prosecutors and defendants. They include training magistrates on the scope for deciding cases themselves rather than referring them to the crown court, and reminding prosecutors that when they recommend where a case should be heard they should take account of the time and cost implications of the delay from taking a case to the crown court. Since many defendants opt for trial in the crown court in the mistaken belief that a lighter sentence is more likely, there is a proposal for an information leaflet giving accurate information on sentencing, particularly the crown courts' use of prison. The committee also raises the prospect of changing the law to prevent petty theft being tried in crown courts.</p>

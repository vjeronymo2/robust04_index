			<p><P> August 10, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH;  </P> <P> LAST-MINUTE VOTE ON MEASURE SCHEDULED  </P> <P> In a race against the clock, the City Council will hold an unusual meeting  today to vote on a proposed ballot measure for the Nov. 6 election. The filing  deadline for ballot measures is 5 p.m. today.  </P> <P> The council will consider a rival ballot measure to an initiative already  placed on the ballot by Save Our Parks, an environmental group. The Save Our  Parks initiative is a proposed city charter amendment that would forbid the  city from selling or leasing park or beach land unless approved by a citywide  vote.  </P> <P> The City Council will vote today on an alternative proposal that would still  allow the city to lease -- but not to sell -- park and beach land without a  citywide vote.  </P> <P> Tom Duchene, a leader of a parents coalition backing a proposed Youth Sports  Complex to be built in Central Park, urged the City Council to adopt the less  restrictive measure. Duchene said that if the Save Our Parks initiative is  approved by the voters on Nov. 6, the Youth Sports Complex will face an  expensive citywide referendum vote.  </P> <P> "We should not force our kids and their parents to wage expensive political  campaigns just to have a place to play in our community," he said.  </P> <P> But in rebuttal, John Fisher, a leader of Save Our Parks, said he believes the  Youth Sports Complex could be built without requiring a citywide vote.  </P> <P> The Youth Sports Complex advocates are not seeking to buy or lease park land.  But Duchene has noted that one provision of the Save Our Parks initiative would  prohibit, in existing parks, any new building costing $100,000 or more unless  approved by a citywide vote.  </P> <P> Duchene said that provision would necessitate getting voter approval of the  Youth Sports Complex, because it would certainly cost at least that much.  Fisher, however, has argued that the project need not cost $100,000 and,  therefore, would not require a citywide vote. BILL BILLITER  </P></p>

			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Lamont rejects steep rise in European Commission budget MR NORMAN LAMONT flatly rejected yesterday the European Commission's plans for a steep rise in the Brussels budget. He also dismissed any suggestion that the government would accept any reduction in Britain's rebate. In his first set-piece speech to the House of Commons since the general election, the chancellor warned his cabinet colleagues to rein back their ambitions for higher public spending too. Mr Lamont said control of the EC budget was essential to his overall plans to hold down public spending and borrowing. He dismissed as an 'ambitious shopping list' the plan by Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, to raise progressively the ceiling on the EC's resources. His implied threat of a veto on any changes which challenged Britain's rebate from Brussels followed a German call earlier this week for the refund to be considered alongside the so-called 'Delors II' package on EC financing. The Commission is preparing its own proposals on the rebate. Officials said that Mr Delors' financing plan could add Pounds 1bn a year to Britain's contribution to Brussels, which will reach Pounds 2.4bn in 1992 even after the rebate is paid. Mr Lamont's remarks came as Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, sought to minimise the size of an expected revolt by Conservative MPs against legislation to implement the Maastricht treaty. Mrs Margaret Thatcher, the former prime minister, plans to launch today a scathing attack on the Commission's ambitions. Mr Hurd told a crowded meeting of Conservative MPs that the government had halted the drive to federalism. A Labour decision yesterday not to vote against the Maastricht treaty assures its passage in the House of Commons, but up to 20 of the government's own supporters plan to oppose it. Reviewing the domestic outlook, the chancellor expressed confidence that the promised economic recovery would become 'firmly established' during 1992. But with ministers braced for official figures today showing unemployment still on an upward trend, he was careful not to put a more precise timetable on his forecast. Mr Lamont stuck to his Budget forecast of a Pounds 28bn public borrowing target in the current financial year but warned cabinet colleagues there could be no overshoot in spending targets for the next three years.

			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / Finance and the Family: Directors' Transactions WITH THE stock market continuing to rise, sales of shares by directors continue to outweigh purchases, although the volume this week is substantially lower than last. Shares in Savills have recovered steadily since Geoffrey van Cutsem bought 20,000 at 30.5p in January. This week, he was among eight directors selling a total of 1.56m at a price of 52p. Since coming to the market in July last year, shares in Anglian Group, a building materials company, have risen by more than 70 per cent. At the time of flotation, it was announced that when the price reached a certain level, the four executive directors of the company would reduce their holdings. They have now sold 975,000 shares. The share price of St James Place Capital has risen steadily over the past year and Nils Taube and Clive Gibson have reduced their holdings by 791,963 and 500,000 (to 5,014,254 and 1,919,810) respectively. These sales follow purchases at 137p by Sir Mark Weinberg, the joint chairman, and Anthony Leonis at the end of July, just after the company said it would acquire International Financial Markets, a London-based investment manager. The sale of 850,000 shares in British Land by John Ritblat followed the purchase of 2m shares at a price of 298p from Quantum Partners, the investment vehicle of George Soros, the currency speculator and international investor, as was agreed at the start of June this year.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- DIRECTORS' SHARE TRANSACTIONS IN THEIR OWN COMPANIES (LISTED &amp; USM)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                  No of Company                  Sector         Shares       Value   directors  --------------------------------------------------------------------- SALES  --------------------------------------------------------------------- ACT Group                  Elns        279,847         523          3* Anglian Group              BdMa        975,000       3,325          4 Automated Secs             BuSe         32,407          51          1 Bellway                     C&amp;C          3,400          14          1 Boxmore Intl               Pack          5,000          12          1 British Land               Prop        404,205       1,427          4* British Land               Prop        850,000       3,001          1 Davenport Vernon           Motr         25,000          35          1 Racal                      Elns          5,000          12          1 Savills                    Prop      1,560,000         811          8 St James Place Cap         OthF      1,291,963       1,938          2 TI Group                   EngG        320,000       1,123          1* Warner Estate              Prop         23,120          55          1  --------------------------------------------------------------------- PURCHASES  --------------------------------------------------------------------- API Group                  Pack         10,000          30          1 British Land               Prop      2,000,000       5,960          1 Carclo Engineering         EngG         30,000          73          1 Haemocell                  Hlth         35,000          33          4 Mansfield Brewery          Brew          1,321          10          1 Mercury Asset Mngmt        OthF          6,000          40          1 Mosaic Investments         Cong      1,130,013         203          4 Owners Abroad               H&amp;L         30,000          22          1  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Value expressed in pounds 000s.

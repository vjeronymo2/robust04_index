			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Technology: Hoping for rich pickings The contracting out of IT by the Northern Ireland civil service has aroused much interest among central government computer departments on the mainland. At least four have sent observers to Belfast. These visits auger well for private-sector suppliers hoping that central government will offer them a third wave of deals following their penetration of local government and health authority IT in the 1980s. This time the pickings could be much bigger as some government departments operate dozens of mainframes spread around the country. Government departments routinely contract out support services such as cleaning, laundry and catering. But a White Paper last November extended the government's policy of 'market testing' into professional and specialist operations such as accountancy, legal services and IT. While a Labour government would change the parameters of official policy and end compulsory competitive tendering in local government, the underlying drive for quality and value-for-money would continue - with some facilities management proposals proving hard to resist. The FM market for IT was worth Pounds 399m in 1991 according to market researchers Romtec, of which the public sector accounted for 43 per cent. Romtec expects the total market to more than double by 1994. 'In the public sector, cost control is a major motive for choosing facilities management,' says Jon Whiteley, of Romtec. It's different from the private sector where FM is valued additionally for enabling a company to concentrate on its core business, he says. 'FM has had some success in local government competing with well-established and mature IT which has acquitted itself well,' says Whiteley. 'These very large government departments are a more ambitious target for an FM supplier to set itself,' he says. The White Paper, Buying Better Public Services, listed central government IT as a 'promising area' for market testing or contracting out. Already the Department of Health is buying IT and management consultancy services worth Pounds 15m from the private sector in 1991-92, while the Inland Revenue expects to buy in more than half of its IT development and operations worth Pounds 80m. The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food uses facilities management on some of its computer systems and buys consultant support worth Pounds 4.5m a year.</p>

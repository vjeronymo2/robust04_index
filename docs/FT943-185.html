			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Cost of ignorance: Robert Rice explains the power that the shadowy body of the European Court has over businesses Europe's employers face costs of billions of pounds in extending pension rights to part-time workers, after rulings this week by the European Court of Justice on sex discrimination in pensions. They have reacted with particular anger to the ruling that part-timers could claim pensions retrospectively if they had been excluded from company schemes after a 1976 judgment by the same court. To many businesses, Wednesday's judgment giving part-time workers pension rights stretching back 18 years seems neither fair nor reasonable. The court's answer was that it had been clear since 1976 that the equal treatment rules of the Rome treaty have direct effect and that they cover the right to join occupational pension schemes. If employers had bothered to examine the case law, they would have known the court was going to reach that decision. Mr David Vaughan QC, a European law expert, agrees: 'No one who had been following developments could have been very surprised. Companies must have known this was on the way. If they had asked, they would have been told. But they didn't. They hoped it would go away.' There remains widespread ignorance about the power of European institutions over national laws. Most Europeans know and accept that Brussels makes rules and regulations which as citizens of the European Union they are bound by. What they know much less about is the role that the European Court of Justice plays in shaping those rules and regulations. The court is one of the four institutions of the EU - the others are the European Commission, the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament. The court interprets the growing body of laws governing the EU and the wider European marketplace. It ensures the even-handed implementation of Brussels legislation by the member states of the Union. It also acts as a check on the growing power of Brussels on behalf of the member states, individuals and companies. And the court goads the Commission and Council into action where they have neglected their obligations under the Treaty of Rome. Its role is central, yet it remains for the most part in the shadows. As a result, it is regularly confused with the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, which is responsible for enforcing the European Convention on Human Rights. It is the ECHR, for example, which will decide whether Mr Ernest Saunders, the former Guinness chairman, was denied a fair trial in 1989. The court's judges are drawn from the judiciaries and legal professions of the member states. They are 13 in number, assisted by six advocates general who act as advisers. There is no nationality requirement, but at present the court has one judge from each member state. They are appointed by 'common accord' of the governments of member states - in effect, they are nominated by their own administrations. Their appointment is for a renewable term of six years. Every three years there is a partial replacement of the court, with seven and six judges replaced alternately. Although the judges are effectively political nominees, they are constitutionally independent. 'The critical thing is that they aren't accountable,' says Mr Vaughan. 'If they were, they would always be at the beck and call of their governments.' He accepts that in the past some judges have modified their behaviour when their time for reappointment drew close. But in general the court has stood up well to pressure and abuse from governments when it has done things they did not like, Mr Vaughan says. To offer the judges additional protection from political interference, the court's deliberations are kept secret and all its judgments are unanimous. Dissenting judgments are not allowed. 'That's why some judgments look like a fudge,' says European barrister Mr Fergus Randolph. 'They are a fudge.' Lord Slynn, a Law Lord and former British judge at the court, is in favour of introducing some way of enabling judges to register dissent so that the differing views can be properly reflected. He believes this would aid understanding of the European legal process. But others are against this, believing that it would increase political pressure on the judges. 'The British government would probably be tolerant if its judges kept voting against it, but I'm not sure all the other countries would,' says Mr Vaughan. If member states feel that the court has gone badly wrong on an issue, they can - as a last resort - refer the judgment to the next intergovernmental conference when the Rome treaty is revised. This happened at Maastricht where a protocol was added to the treaty limiting the effect of the 1990 Barber judgment on equal pensions to rights accrued after the May 1990 date of the ruling. However, the issue of retrospective pension rights for part-time workers is unlikely to feature at the next intergovernmental conference in 1996. Given the history of court judgments on equal treatment since 1976, there is unlikely to be political support for reopening the issue.</p>

			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / Letter: Changes to EC constitution not necessary for single market Sir, Mr Sutherland's comments (Personal View, May 28) on the long-standing federal characteristics of the EC and on the role of the Commission are quite right. However, his arguments and examples refer to the single market, the principle of which is widely supported - even among members of the Bruges Group. As he says, that support implies a willingness to accept some abrogation of national sovereignty in exchange for measures that are demonstrably necessary for effective functioning of the single market. But that concession, for that purpose, does not remove the possibility of objecting to abrogations of sovereignty for other purposes. 'It is unreasonable to argue against regulation from Brussels,' Mr Sutherland says, 'particularly when the effect of the regulation is to dismantle protection.' What nonsense. Having accepted the principle of the single market, it is unreasonable to argue against regulations that are necessary to put the principle into practice. Any other regulation or act is fair game. The changes in the EC constitution proposed at Maastricht are not necessary for the single market. Nor are various current proposals of the Commission - for example, the Euro soap opera planned by the directorate-general for information and culture (DG-X). New justification is needed for such measures. Proponents of a 'deeper' Community have failed to provide one, as is suggested by Mr Sutherland's attempt to deduce general consent to EC federalism from consent to the single market, and by his ritualistic reference to the Second World War. Few want another war between France and Germany. But what line of reasoning implies that a deeper Community is necessary to avoid one? The single market is not a central issue in current debate about the structure of the EC. Those who advocate a deepened Community could move the debate forward by providing a reasoned case for their views. Brian Hindley, London School of Economics, Houghton Street, London WC2A 2AE</p>

			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / Japan risks losing lead in industrial competitiveness JAPAN has maintained its world lead in industrial competitiveness for the seventh consecutive year but, for the first time, there are doubts about the future, according to the annual World Competitiveness Report published today by the International Institute for Management Development (IMD) and the World Economic Forum. Germany takes second place in the competitiveness rankings from the US, which has slipped to fifth. Some way behind Germany comes its previous rival, Switzerland, in third place, followed rather surprisingly by Denmark, which has boosted its position to fourth from eighth in 1991. The rankings of 22 industrialised and 14 developing countries are based on more than 330 criteria grouped into eight competitiveness factors. Hard statistical data are supplemented by the results of an international survey of executives who evaluate their country's ability to compete on world markets. This year, some 3,300 questionnaires were returned, out of 18,000 mailed. The report suggests a weakening of Japanese competitiveness from previous years. Japan continues to lead on factors such as the strength of the domestic economy, management, research and development and education. But its scores on integration into the world economy, government policies, finance (following turmoil in Japanese financial markets) and the attitude of young people to life and work have slipped. Germany too could face future problems of competitiveness. The report says German companies may increasingly invest abroad as the advantages of low wages in eastern Germany are eroded, so reducing the country's strength in foreign trade. At the same time, the report notes that world recession has favoured countries such as Japan and Germany which excel in producing high-quality goods with a superior price-quality ratio.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Professor Dr. Heinrich Kurz, director of the </F> Institute of Semiconductor Technology, Aachen Technical College,  by Jeanne Rubner; place and date not given: "Is The JESSI  [Joint European Submicron Silicon Initiative] Project A  Failure?"]    [Text]    [Rubner] The federal research minister recently spoke  positively about the European microelectronics project JESSI  [Joint European Submicron Silicon Initiative]. But critics  speak of window dressing. As a researcher who was involved in  JESSI, how do you see it?    [Kurz] It is more than window dressing, but we must take  into  consideration that it was not the federal minister who landed us  in JESSI. JESSI is, so to speak, an old boys' network, and a  minister who is a layman is taken in by the window dressing.  The fact is, there is a vast discrepancy between the claims and  the results. None of JESSI's big "flag ships" has got off the  ground. On the contrary, the fleet has almost sunk already.    [Rubner] Can you tell us what the project's most important  flag ships were?    [Kurz] Apart from the clusters, the joint projects in  manufacturing technology, which were also not particularly  successful, there are five applications flag ships. These are:  high resolution television, digital broadcasting, broadband  communications, mobile radio, and safety electronics for  automobiles. The high resolution television project has just  gone under, mobile radio is firmly in the hands of firms that  were not sponsored by JESSI. The problem is that there were  several changes of strategy. Industry regarded JESSI as a  sponsorship program for itself in which firms need not have  clear objectives.    [Rubner] Yet the European semiconductor industry still has  only a small share of the world market. Surely more must have  gone wrong than just a change of strategy?    [Kurz] The failings go back 15 or 20 years. The five-year  program running until 1996 has at best delayed Europe's  withdrawal from the world market. Initially, JESSI was not  intended to be a program for capturing the market, but to create  the technological basis for the microelectronics industry. Only  later were substantial parts of a basic program abandoned to  press ahead with applications.    [Rubner] Applications are not necessarily bad. Where did  JESSI go wrong?    [Kurz] If firms are always looking out of the corner of  their eye for more competent partners outside of JESSI, there is  bound to be failure in applications.    [Rubner] With 150 firms involved, does that not entail an  enormous amount of bureaucracy?    [Kurz] Here we have Europe's old complaint again. The money  that was spent on administration could have been put into basic  research or given directly to competent firms without them  having to find a pseudo-common objective. But all European  projects have this problem.    [Rubner] Among others, a European CAD [computer-aided  design] software program is cited as a successful JESSI project.  Why was it worth spending millions on it?    [Kurz] I don't understand it at all. But JESSI sets great  store by the project partners talking to each other. It would  of course have been more honest if JESSI had been called a  political integration program from the start.    [Rubner] Have there been technically good results?    [Kurz] Yes, isolated ones in the areas of the clusters I  mentioned. But the question remains whether the progress was  not rather the result of ideas from the USA or Japan, or from  JESSI. By the way, one particular misjudgment was X-ray  lithography.    [Rubner] But most experts didn't expect it would be possible  to make the 64 megabit chip without X-ray lithography.    [Kurz] That isn't the case. There are a lot of predictions  about how far optical lithography will go. They were still  talking about X-ray lithography in JESSI when the Japanese were  already announcing the 64-megabit chip with optical processes.    [Rubner] JESSI runs out in 1996. What ought to come then?    [Kurz] Certainly not a repetition. We already know how  JESSI will end. The people with political responsibility should  already be setting up an independent commission of enquiry so  that competent experts can talk about the next stage. The most  important questions are: What is a long-term research strategy?  What is the correct form of involvement for the universities,  Fraunhofer Institutes and others? We need new methods to better  develop Europe's existing potential. There should at all events  be greater [financial] support for basic research, particularly  in the direction of automatic mini labs, that is small factories  in which special chips, Asics [application-specific integrated  circuits] for short, are made. Funding should be awarded solely  according to scientific and technical criteria -- not like in  JESSI, where industry acted like a society for self-advancement  in deciding who would get money.</p>

			<p><P> December 26, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN CLEMENTE;  </P> <P> REDEVELOPMENT WAS LIMITED TO PIER IN '90  </P> <P> Redevelopment in this seaside city over the last year was limited to repairing  the city pier after plans for a project to restore a historic home fell  through, according to a recent city report.  </P> <P> The city's relatively small redevelopment area includes the bluff-top Casa  Romantica, built as a private residence for San Clemente's founder in the  mid-1920s, and the area just below it, known as the Pier Bowl. This includes  the parking area and residential streets surrounding the municipal pier on  Avenida Victoria.  </P> <P> Although lofty plans to upgrade both areas were expected to be in place by now,  the city was forced to put them on hold when Ratkovich Co., a Los Angeles-based  developer selected to restore Casa Romantica, dropped out of the project after  its reconstruction plans drew public opposition. The city purchased the home in  1989 for $2 million with the intent of preserving it as a landmark.  </P> <P> Delaying the plans for Casa Romantica also delayed a Pier Bowl Master Plan that  proposes to redesign city parking areas and provide more commercial  opportunities near the pier. Also on hold are plans to expand the Fisherman's  Restaurant at the base of the pier.  </P> <P> Previously discussed plans for the Pier Bowl included a small hotel and a  restaurant on the hillside just below Casa Romantica, as well as a multilevel  parking structure. But a public outcry against such drastic changes forced city  officials to scale back the plans.  </P> <P> Redevelopment agency profits of $915,000 from the 1989-90 fiscal year are  projected to increase by only $100,000 in fiscal year 1990-91, because the city  does not plan on acquiring more property, according to the report.  </P> <P> "Based on the revenue picture for next year, most of the (profits) will be from  tax-increment funding," said Assistant Financial Director Mike White.  </P> <P> Required property taxes in the redevelopment area are frozen at 1975 levels,  when the redevelopment agency was founded, White explained. The city profits  from the difference between 1975 and current-year property values for the land,  he said.  </P> <P> The agency also sets aside 20% of its funds to assist with home improvements  for low-income families, White said. The agency so far has collected about  $640,000 for this purpose, according to the report. WENDY PAULSON  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with PAC President Clarence Makwetu by Tos </F> Wentzel; place and date not given]    [Text] On the state of support for the parties in the  election campaign, especially in view of the fact that opinion  polls suggest that the PAC's [Pan-Africanist Congress] support  is very low:    The problem with the opinion polls is that they have never  been accurate. For instance, for the last elections in Britain  they said the Labour Party was winning. Before the first  elections in Zimbabwe they predicted that Nkomo and Muzorewa  would win. In my own experience the opinion polls have never  been very accurate. Secondly we do not know what criteria were  used. We do not know who was approached. For instance I have  never been approached by the so-called analysts. It seems as if  the bulk of the electorate is never canvassed, hence the  discrepancies. We are working with the grassroots we know who  they are supporting and why (PAC support) is far higher and  everybody will be shocked by the election result. Our aim is not  to come with claims of support but to win the election. We are  not coming up with predictions.    On the structure of the PAC and rumours that the PAC is  cash- strapped:    The PAC has never been a rich organisation, but we manage  somehow because we work with our people and they are the people  who are supporting the organisation. There is talk that the  playing field should be levelled for the election but this is  mere talk. We don't see this in practice. What you are  witnessing is the international community together with big  business and the media supporting one party, the ANC [African  National Congress]. Yet these are the people who are said to be  promoting multiparty democracy. We feel that in the long run  our country will be turned into a one-party state under this  arrangement.    On whether ANC promises to the electorate are  realistic:    Our position is that we don't have all the answers. We are  putting our case to the people to come forward with their ideas  so that we can see what we can implement. The ANC is talking  about millions of houses, of jobs etc...(this) is dangerous.    On the position of APLA [Azanian People's Liberation  Army] and the possibility of resuming the armed struggle:    We did not willingly embark on armed struggle. We were  forced into it. But if we are forced to again, we will have to  consider that position. If our demands on a number of issues  are not met...we have been economically exploited, politically  oppressed and socially degraded. Unless that situation is  addressed we can never say our country has been freed.    On whether the PAC leadership has control over  APLA:    The highest organ of the PAC is the national conference.  This is the body that gives the money to APLA.    But it is not the policy of the PAC that APLA should be  obliged to tell us who they are going to strike and where.  These are the details that are left to APLA.    On the question of land redistribution, whether it  applies to blacks only and how it is to be achieved:    We don't have blacks in the PAC, only the African people.  The African people have been deprived of their birthright for  centuries and this is the situation we are promising our people  to address immediately we are in power. There are various ways  of doing it. There are various instruments that can be applied.  For instance, we don't talk of nationalisation. In countries  where it has been applied it had the tendency of robbing the  elite for the benefit of another elite, not the grassroots  people who have had promises made to them.    On the controversy about the slogan "one settler, one  bullet" and the PAC leadership's attitude to it:    Firstly, it is not the PAC that has initiated this term  settler. It is the whites themselves, but when we call them  settlers they get annoyed. If you go to Grahamstown today you  will find a monument to the 1820 British settlers. It was not  the PAC or APLA who named them settlers. If you drive from D.F.  Malan airport to Cape Town you drive along Settlers Way and it  was not the PAC again who called that road Settlers Way. Near  Pretoria there is a small town called Settlers and once again  PAC and APLA had nothing to do with this.    On whether the term does not have a racist  connotation:    It has no racist connotation whatsoever. According to our  definition the African is the aboriginal of this country. All  who show allegiance to Africa and are prepared to abide by the  rule of the African majority are Africans regardless of colour.  We do not look at your complexion whatsoever. We do not have  the word "black" in the PAC.    On the future:    One has to hope that the elections will be free and fair but  I am afraid that up this moment I do not think that will be the  position. The PAC has committed itself already that we will  honour the results of that election if they are free and fair.  But in order for elections to be free and fair the playing  fields should be levelled now, and not after the elections.  This is what is not taking place in our country at the moment.  The media is totally opposed to certain parties especially the  PAC. The business community and international community has the  same attitude. I don't know how the playing fields can be  levelled unless those attitudes are changed.    On whether he has the time to relax and how he does  it:    There is very little time for me to really relax these days  because I have so many engagements. I happened to be a farmer  but now that belongs to the past because I no longer have time.  I do a little reading whenever I have time but I seldom do. I  am always engaged. I read everything I can lay my hands on. I  love history.</p>

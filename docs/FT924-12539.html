			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Lloyds plans to shut down merchant banking division LLOYDS BANK, the smallest of the Big Four clearers by asset size, is to close Lloyds Merchant Bank, its loss-making merchant-banking operation, and transfer three other business units to the parent bank. The decision to shut Lloyds Merchant Bank, a tiny operation compared with the merchant bank arm of Barclays or National Westminster, comes after several years in which it has incurred losses. In the first half of this year Lloyds Merchant Bank announced a loss of Pounds 14m. The bank will be gradually phased out of existence during the next two years, but only 50 jobs will be lost from its 360 workforce. At the same time, Lloyds is to transfer Lloyds Investment Managers, Lloyds Development Capital, its venture capital arm, and Lloyds Bank Stockbrokers to report directly to the parent bank. When the bank reported an 11 per cent increase in interim pre-tax group profits to Pounds 369m in August, investment managing and stockbroking were reported to be doing well. The closure of Lloyds Merchant Bank is the latest in a series of withdrawals by Lloyds from unprofitable activities in the UK and overseas to concentrate on more profitable retail banking lines of business and small and medium-sized corporate business. At the time of Big Bang in 1986, Lloyds Merchant Bank was intended to compete with the merchant banking arms of Lloyds' main rivals, but its range of activities contracted steadily in the late 1980s.</p>

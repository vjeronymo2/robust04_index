			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / Asbestos accord may herald end of US litigation: Deal could allay worst fears of Lloyd's Names The end of multi-billion dollar litigation that has forced many asbestos companies to close and posed a threat to insurers, including many Lloyd's syndicates, could be in sight after the approval of a Dollars 1.3bn (Pounds 830m) out-of-court settlement in the US. Judge Lowell Reed, a federal judge in Philadelphia, this week approved the deal which involves 20 asbestos companies. About 100,000 Americans who have been exposed to asbestos will be compensated if they contract certain diseases in a deal negotiated between lawyers and the Centre for Claims Resolution, an asbestos industry body formed to handle personal injury claims. Under the scheme, victims of mesothelioma, a cancer of the lung lining, will receive between Dollars 20,000 and Dollars 200,000 and victims of other lung cancers between Dollars 10,000 and Dollars 86,000. Awards will be Dollars 5,000 to Dollars 32,000 for other cancers linked to asbestos exposure and between Dollars 2,500 and Dollars 30,000 for non-malignant diseases. Each year's total awards will also be capped, however, further reducing the average level of individual awards. Britain's T&amp;N, the second largest company represented by the Centre, predicted that the settlement would significantly reduce its liability provisions for asbestos-linked legal action. Mr Colin Hope, chairman and chief executive, said: 'It will restrict future liability and, once the transition to the new procedures is complete, result in a reduction in litigation costs over the next 10 years.' However, he ruled out such a scheme being adopted in Britain, where claimants do not have the same recourse to product liability action as in the US. T&amp;N - which as Turner &amp; Newall was Britain's main supplier of asbestos  - also claimed that the overall incidence of asbestos-related diseases was on the decline. The Centre represents only about a quarter of the now largely defunct US asbestos industry. But Mr Lawrence Fitzpatrick, chief executive, said other former asbestos companies were interested in expanding the scheme which could serve as a model for resolving the problem.' This country has let the asbestos litigation get badly out of control,' said Mr Fitzpatrick. Some 200,000 legal claims - not covered by this week's deal - have been filed. Total costs already amount to some Dollars 10bn, with much of the burden falling on insurers. These insurers, who are expected to fund about two-thirds of the US settlement, should benefit from the deal. Lloyd's Names may gain some relief from the settlement, which could allay their worst fears about huge claims in US courts. The extent of the London market's exposure to the companies involved in this week's settlement is not yet known. However, final approval of the deal is uncertain, because lawyers acting for victims or potential victims are divided. Mr Ron Motley, an attorney acting for potential victims, said the decision 'puts an end to asbestos gridlock that has meant victims dying on the court house steps'. But other lawyers oppose the deal and will appeal. Mr Brent Rosenthal of the Dallas-based lawyers, Baron &amp; Budd, said people who have not yet developed asbestos-related diseases were in effect being asked to give up their legal rights, and he criticised the ceilings on the awards.

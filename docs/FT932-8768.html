			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / EC prescribes Russian bank fraud cure THE CENTRAL bank of Russia must simplify its bureaucracy in order to combat banking fraud and supervise more effectively the country's commercial banks, according to a report financed by the European Commission. The study on 'restructuring needs of the banking system in Russia' to be published later this month, covers everything from banking legislation to the ailing payments system. Drawn up by French bank Union Europeenne de CIC and auditors Arthur Andersen, it says 'current legislation and regulations do not provide any rules . . . to prevent or suppress the potential malfunction of the Russian banking system'. It says there are too many small under-capitalised banks which 'exist only to borrow funds on the interbank market or from private depositors' to finance unprofitable enterprises which are the banks' shareholders. It notes the lack of rules limiting bank ownership by industrial or commercial enterprises. A rule forbidding single shareholders owning more than 35 per cent of a bank, does not specify whether this includes indirect stakes. At present most commercial banks admit there is virtually no supervision from the central bank. The report suggests that, in the short term, the central bank should reduce the substantial amount of data it collects from commercial banks to focus on a few key indicators. It suggests a rating system to reward banks which comply with central bank requirements, and calls for central bank guidelines on suspect transactions and money laundering. Bankruptcy procedures should be better defined, as should a deposit protection scheme provided for by Russian law but which is so vaguely defined that insurance funds remain open to misuse. Apart from supervision, the central bank's other persistent headache is overhauling a payments system which can take weeks to transfer money, loses documents and is vulnerable to fraud. While five western central banks have begun concerted efforts to help the Russian central bank with this task, the report recommends standardising payment documents and using serial numbers to boost the system's 'low' security level. A few small reforms are already being implemented with foreign assistance. The central bank which today launches Russia's first treasury bill issue, also plans to begin auctioning off central bank credits, according to Mr Alexander Khandruyev, a deputy governor of the bank. The credit auctions, prepared with the help of the International Monetary Fund, are designed to ensure more effective distribution of central bank resources. However, critics say the fact that the central bank will decide which banks can take part allows for possible corruption. It is also not clear how an auction based on the highest bidder will ensure that the money goes to worthy causes.</p>

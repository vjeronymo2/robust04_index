			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Jia Fenyong (6328 1164 0516)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 13 Jun (XINHUA) -- The "Interim Provisions  on the Employment of State Functionaries" were officially  promulgated by the Ministry of Personnel today for  implementation. They represented another important set of  measures taken by China after the promulgation of the "Interim  Regulations on State Functionaries" to establish and implement a  public service system.    A person in charge of the Ministry of Personnel said: While  carrying forward the fine tradition of China's system for the  selection and employment of cadres, and while drawing on the  useful experience of foreign countries in personnel appraisal,  the "Provisions" conscientiously summed up the practice of  employment through examination in the past six years or so and  provided specific stipulations on every link for the employment  of state functionaries. As such, they will play an active role  in guarding the "entrance" to state administrative organs, in  guaranteeing the basic quality of newly employed state  functionaries, and in promoting honesty and industriousness of  government organs in the performance of official duties.    The "Provisions" pointed out: The employment of state  functionaries refers to the selection of state functionaries for  nonleadership positions at and below the level of chief section  member. As regards state functionaries selected from organs  other than administrative organs to assume leadership positions  and nonleadership positions at and above the deputy section  level, they shall be transferred and do not fall under the  category of employment. The criterion of hiring people with  both political integrity and ability as well as the principle of  openness, equality, competition, and selecting the best shall be  upheld in the employment of state functionaries. Meanwhile,  preferential treatment shall be given to applicants who are  either of minority nationalities or ex-servicemen.    The Ministry of Personnel required that all units, whether  they are carrying out organizational reform or not, must  gradually establish a personnel mechanism that encourages  openness, equality, and competition, beginning this year.  Starting from the date the "Provisions" were promulgated, all  areas and departments must handle jobs in strict accordance with  the "Provisions." Whenever they employ personnel for leadership  [as printed] positions at and below the level of chief section  member, they must hold public examinations and select the best  from among applicants. Beginning from the second half of this  year, the Examinations and Employment Department of the Ministry  of Personnel will formulate a series of detailed rules and  regulations for implementation on the basis of the "Provisions,"  and will organize unified examinations for the employment of  functionaries for the State Council's ministries, commissions,  and organs.    According to his briefing, 29 provinces, municipalities, and  autonomous regions across the country and 63 departments of the  State Council have adopted the method of holding examinations,  to various extents, to employ over 71,000 people by selecting  the excellent ones from among over 470,000 applicants for the  supplement of their personnel since 1989. The practice of these  examinations not only lays a foundation for the promulgation of  laws and regulations on employment, but accumulates experience  for the implementation of a public service system in an  all-round way.</p>

			<p><P> January 22, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHAKESPEARE, MOZART, PUCCINI;  </P> <P> OPERA REVIEWS;  </P> <P> A FINE 'FIGARO' AT MUSIC CENTER  </P> <P> No shenanigans. No gimmicks. No cliches. No caricatures. No exaggerations. No  innovative distortions.  </P> <P> Whew.  </P> <P> The Music Center Opera takes the human comedy of "Le Nozze di Figaro," which  opened at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion on Friday, very seriously.  </P> <P> This doesn't mean that the production, borrowed from the Chicago Lyric Opera,  reveres tradition for its own tired sake. It merely means that the director,  Peter Hall, and his associates have gone back to Mozart and Da Ponte --  possibly back further to Beaumarchais -- for their inspirations.  </P> <P> This may not be a perfect marriage. The singing is a bit uneven. The musical  perspective seems more romantic than baroque. One can quibble.  </P> <P> Still, Hall and Stephen Lawless, his faithful directorial ally, really care  about the characters, their needs and their frustrations. That makes all the  difference.  </P> <P> This "Figaro" savors telling motivation and expressive detail. The action  springs forward with a disarming air of spontaneity in recitatives that really  sound like casual conversation. The words count.  </P> <P> Interrupted by a single intermission, rather than the usual three, the long and  convoluted narrative flows naturally, almost quickly. Compositional sprawl is  minimized and cumulative tensions are heightened.  </P> <P> The intrusion of farce is permitted only where it is logical and irrepressible:  in the mistaken-identity hysteria of the garden scene. And here it is  strikingly effective because it sets off the cathartic pathos of understanding  and forgiveness that follows ("Contessa, perdono . . . ").  </P> <P> The musical standards of this "Figaro" turn out to be somewhat less lofty.  Lawrence Foster, the conscientious if somewhat bland conductor, has opened all  the conventional cuts. Even Marcellina and Basilio get to attempt their bravura  arias in the last act. Foster has restored the high Cs of the second-act  terzetto to the Countess. In general, one must admire his integrity, not to  mention his concern for matters of poise, balance and propulsion.  </P> <P> Like hungry little Oliver, however, a Mozartean ingrate wants more. He wants  more moon-struck lyricism for Susanna's "Deh vieni, non tardar," more ironic  fury for Figaro's "Aprite un po' quegli occhi." In the enlightened days of  1990, he wants some linear embellishment, a few cadenzas, consistent  appoggiaturas.  </P> <P> Although the Los Angeles cast can boast several international stars, the  participants obviously appreciate ensemble values. That is rare, and wonderful.  </P> <P> Young Rodney Gilfry introduces a very wide-eyed, very intelligent and very  mellifluous Figaro. With agile wit, he holds his own against the mature,  magnificently befuddled Count of Thomas Allen, whose darker baritone encounters  vocal problems only in the climactic fioriture of "Vedro mentr'io sospiro." It  may be worth noting, incidentally, that Allen has frequently sung the role of  Figaro, and Gilfry will soon depart for Germany where he is to sing the Count.  </P> <P> Arleen Auger is a somewhat matronly, unaristocratic Countess, and on this  occasion she sang her two great arias with unaccustomed, gingerly caution. But  she certainly knows the style. Angela Maria Blasi -- tiny, adorable and totally  innocent of arch soubrette manners -- sounded engagingly wistful if sometimes a  shade too wispy as Susanna.  </P> <P> Frederica von Stade remains the Cherubino of one's dreams. She somehow manages  to be impetuous, cheeky, sensitive, shy, smug, erotically combustible and  self-amused, all at the same delirious time. Also, she happens to sing as one  hopes angels sing.  </P> <P> The buffo roles were discreetly delineated by versatile members of the local  team. Marvellee Cariaga stumbled a bit in the formidable flourishes of "Il  capro e la capretta," yet she managed to make the usually crotchety Marcellina  sympathetically as well as amusingly maternal. Michael Gallup dispatched the  pomposities of Bartolo with crisp abandon. Jonathan Mack offered a beautifully  vocalized Basilio (that may be an oxymoron), though the impact of the sly old  intriguer was compromised by sketchy characterization.  </P> <P> Dale Wendel, like all Barbarinas, looked cute and piped prettily. John Atkins  revealed an unsuspected flair for character comedy as a blustery Antonio.  Stephen Plummer stammered dutifully and unfunnily as Curzio.  </P> <P> John Bury's raked, warm-hued sets and muted costumes (a bit dowdy in the case  of the Countess) exerted their own atmospheric allure. The Chicago decors  seemed small, however, for the Pavilion proscenium -- one doesn't automatically  achieve intimacy merely by leaving the sides empty -- and the banks of stage  lights visible in the wings remained an irksome, Brechtian anachronism.  </P> <P> Francis Rizzo's thoughtfully phrased supertitles were, well, supertitles:  distracting or helpful, depending on the viewer's priorities. They actually  came close to destroying the poignant climax of the opera (the audience  tittered at that sublime moment when the Count finally begs for forgiveness).  </P> <P> At least the instant translations reinforced the syllabic rhythm of the Italian  text. And, for once, an attempt was made to time the word-flashes in a way that  would discourage premature laughter ("Ecco tuo padre....").  </P> <P> This was, in all, a happy marriage.  </P></p>

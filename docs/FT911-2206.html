			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading THE EXPECTED squeeze in the equity futures market ahead of the expiry of the April FT-SE 100 index options contract failed to materialise yesterday. Instead, the market remained on the defensive as Wall Street reacted with a distinct lack of enthusiasm to the reduction in US interest rates. Barclays de Zoete Wedd was said to be short of April 2,500 FT-SE puts before the options expiry. But when the futures market failed to hold above 2,500, it was forced to try to buy back puts and hedge itself by selling the futures market. So by the time of the expiry of the April options, the Footsie futures' lead over the cash index had been whittled away to just 10 points, which depressed the stock market. This was reflected in the options market turnover figures, which showed the FT-SE contracts accounting for over 9,000 lots or a third of the day's business. FT-SE options normally make up just under a quarter of daily turnover. The June FT-SE future closed at 2,509, down 12 points. Its premium to the spot FT-SE index ended at 26 points, compared with 22 at the previous close and fair value of 15. British Gas options were heavily traded on news of its agreement to tough controls on price rises. Investors sold puts and calls. The June 260 calls had 1,900 lots traded.</p>

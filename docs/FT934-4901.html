			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / Clarke warns of low annual pay rises for public sector Mr Kenneth Clarke yesterday called for a permanent break with Britain's postwar pay bargaining culture as he warned that 5m public sector workers could expect only 'very modest' increases for the next three years. In confident mood after the favourable reaction on the Conservative backbenches to Tuesday's Budget, the chancellor said that higher pay awards in the public sector could only be financed by efficiency savings. He offered a strong hint that this would mean a ceiling on pay increases for most public sector workers of 1 or 2 per cent a year. But other cabinet ministers suggested that workers in 'politically sensitive' sectors such as the police, nurses and teachers might expect more. Mr Clarke's budget package continued to draw wide support from both the right and left of the Conservative party, despite rumblings among some backbench MPs about the impact of planned defence cuts. He moved swiftly to counter angry opposition charges that deep cuts in benefits for the unemployed and for those on invalidity unveiled by Mr Peter Lilley marked the beginning of an assault on the welfare state. Brushing aside the ambitions of some of his rightwing colleagues to shrink the size of the public sector, Mr Clarke said the basic state pension would remain a permanent fixture. He dismissed recent suggestions by Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, that the government might encourage people to 'opt' out of the basic pension and other fundamental entitlements. The chancellor's tough line on pay came amid mounting anger among trades unions that relatively low-paid public sector workers would bear the brunt of the Budget's squeeze on Whitehall budgets. Overall, the cuts in the spending targets for the next three years were judged by Mr Andrew Dilnot, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, to represent a far tougher policy than anything achieved in the 1980s. But Mr Clarke insisted that low inflation had transformed the environment in which wage bargaining would take place and said those in work had to take account of the interests of almost 3m people who were unemployed. Arguing that Britain would not have a better opportunity 'in my lifetime' to achieve permanently low inflation, Mr Clarke challenged the culture of the 1960s and 1970s which had led to the annual pay round. The new environment had undercut the case for the annual wage round, which had been started when inflation was at levels which made workers 'markedly poorer' if their pay was not increased every year. There were now 'large parts of the private sector' where the whole idea of the annual pay rise was no longer relevant.</p>

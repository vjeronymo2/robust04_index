			<p><P> February 19, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEW;  </P> <P> BARBIERI QUINTET AT COACH HOUSE  </P> <P> There's no mistaking the tenor sax sound of Gato Barbieri. His lusty tone and  the naked, climactic nature of his improvisations gave his music its trademark  eroticism long before he recorded the soundtrack to "Last Tango in Paris."  </P> <P> Barbieri's first set Saturday at the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano was  full of the emotion for which the Argentinian-native is known. Leading a  quintet through a heavily Latin-influenced program of originals and the  occasional standard, the saxophonist showed a considered, narrative style of  soloing, full of simple, expressive statements peppered with loud outbursts and  elephantine cries that sounded as though they were pulled right out of a Tarzan  movie.  </P> <P> Barbieri's tone and his thematic approach to a solo still owe much to Sonny  Rollins, one of his early infuences. But his attack is pure John Coltrane, ripe  with confession and filled with anguished shouts that begin and end on a single  note. Barbieri doesn't display the technical skills of Coltrane or Rollins;  rather than constructing long, intricate statements, he prefers to string  together simple melody variations while building to a climax.  </P> <P> Almost all the numbers heard Saturday followed the same format: Barbieri  floated sustained, gritty tones over waves of percussion from drummer Rich  Gonzales and percussionist Guilherme Franco while pianist Eddy Martinez swirled  up and down the keyboard. The rhythm onslaught subsided and a groove, led by  bassist Nilson Matta, was established before Barbieri stated the theme.  Percussive support increased as the saxophonist's statements became more  frantic, finally culminating with Barbieri's gravelly declarations and piercing  screams.  </P> <P> Because of this, and the Latin rhythms imposed over every selection, tunes as  disparate as "What a Difference a Day Makes" and Barbieri's own "Yamarito" all  ended up sounding pretty much the same. Surely the saxophonist knows that, just  as with love, variety keeps the program interesting.BILL KOHLHAASE  </P></p>

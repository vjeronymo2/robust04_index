			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Fayed steps up attack on Aitken: Hotel owner challenges account of how Paris Ritz bill was paid Mr Jonathan Aitken's explanation of circumstances surrounding the payment of his hotel bill at the Paris Ritz was challenged yesterday by Mr Mohamed Fayed, the hotel's owner. As Mr Fayed stepped up his allegations against Mr Aitken, Treasury chief secretary, The Guardian was facing a Commons inquiry into its handling of disclosures about the bill. Miss Betty Boothroyd, the Speaker, ordered an investigation into The Guardian's admission that it used a doctored Commons letterhead to seek details of Mr Aitken's bill. Amid rowdy Commons exchanges, The Guardian's use of subterfuge was described as 'quite deplorable' by Mr John Prescott, Labour's deputy leader. Sir James Spicer, a Tory member of the powerful privileges committee, said Mr Peter Preston, The Guardian's editor, should resign. More than 100 Tory backbenchers signed a Commons motion calling for Mr Preston's conduct to be referred to Mrs Barbara Mills, the director of public prosecutions. Mr Preston defended the use of the letterhead, which he said was part of an arrangement with Mr Fayed intended to allow the Ritz management to release details of the bill. 'Of course in retrospect, even for this internal communication, it would have been better to have used another heading on the notepaper. But the purpose was to protect the source at the time - it was not to deceive anybody,' he said. Mr Fayed, the owner of Harrods, said he took 'full responsibility' for assisting The Guardian 'in the public interest'. But he raised further questions about the way in which part of the bill was paid initially by Mr Said Ayas, a former business associate of Mr Aitken. He also claimed that inquiries in Paris had shown that a brunette woman who paid part of the bill in cash had also paid bills for other guests with a cheque drawn on Mr Ayas's bank account. The identity of the woman has been a central aspect of the mystery surrounding the bill. Mr Aitken told an inquiry carried out by Sir Robin Butler, cabinet secretary, that she was his Swiss-born wife, Lolicia. But Mr Fayed said the woman told the Ritz cashier in French: 'I have been paying other bills at the George V and the Intercontinental. Here is the cheque for Mr Ayas's account.' He said that 'unless Mrs Aitken was also paying the other cheques to the other hotels, the brunette in question was working on Mr Ayas's staff'. Mr Fayed's spokesman, Mr Michael Cole, said there were inconsistencies between the details of a cheque apparently written by Mr Aitken to clear up a discrepancy over payment of his bill and the bank statement of the recipient. Pressure for a public hearing into cash for questions allegations against two Conservative MPs increased as Sir Edward Heath, the former prime minister, backed calls for the privileges committee to change its rules. Mr David Alton, a Liberal Democrat member of the committee, said its inquiry into Mr David Tredinnick and Mr Graham Riddick should be extended to include other allegations of impropriety against ministers and MPs. A Labour attempt to force the committee to sit in public was defeated by 301 votes to 264 in the Commons last night, leaving the committee to make its own decision today. The seven Labour members decided last night to end a boycott of the committee, suggesting they believe it will decide to sit at least partly in public.

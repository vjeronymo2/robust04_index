			<p><P> June 2, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HOUSE PAINTER SENTENCED FOR VAN THEFT  </P> <P> A San Fernando house painter was given a six-month suspended sentence Thursday  after pleading no contest to charges he stole a Volkswagen bus in which a  23-year-old man sat dying of a gunshot wound.  </P> <P> Vaughn Grant, 39, pleaded no contest to grand theft charges last month in San  Fernando Superior Court. He was arrested about 4 a.m. April 21 after Los  Angeles police stopped a van he was driving in Pacoima and found Walter Bickly  Hackman of Palm Desert suffering from a gunshot wound in the torso. Hackman was  pronounced dead shortly afterward.  </P> <P> Prosecutors contend Hackman was shot in a drug deal turned sour and drove the  van about 100 yards before collapsing. They said Grant, whom they do not  believe was involved in the shooting, chanced upon the van with the wounded  victim inside, stole $50 from him and drove the vehicle away.  </P> <P> Police stopped the van because it fit a description given them by witnesses to  the shooting. When police ordered Grant out of the van, he dropped a bloodied  $50 bill, which Deputy Dist. Atty. Ken Barshop said was entered as evidence in  the case.  </P> <P> Police said they believe Hackman was shot by Eric Cunningham, who authorities  said is a Pacoima narcotics dealer, after the two argued about a drug  transaction. Los Angeles police Detective Steve Fisk said an arrest warrant has  been issued for Cunningham.  </P> <P> They did not find evidence linking Grant to the shooting and witnesses said he  was not involved, Barshop said.  </P> <P> In an interview after the sentencing, Grant said he was trying to drive Hackman  to the hospital when stopped by police. He denied possessing a bloodied $50  bill and said he agreed to plead no contest to the charges only because  authorities told him they would release him from custody.  </P> <P> Fisk, however, questioned Grant's version.  </P> <P> "He said he was taking the poor gentleman to the hospital, but when the police  officers passed him, he didn't make any attempt to flag them down," Fisk said.  "One has to wonder whether his intentions were to take this man to the hospital  for medical treatment or to get a free ride and fifty dollars."  </P> <P> Grant said he did not flag down police because he was in a hurry to get to the  hospital. He said his experience will deter other future good Samaritans who  may now be reluctant to intervene in emergency situations.  </P></p>

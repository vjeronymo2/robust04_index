			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / UK Company News: Engineering side behind 10% fall at Jones Group JONES GROUP, the Dublin-based engineering and shipping company, reported a 10 per cent fall, from IPounds 5.51m to IPounds 4.96m (Pounds 4.52m), in pre-tax profits for 1991. The group cited the effect of the global recession on the engineering division for the drop. The division showed a significant decline in both turnover and profits. Enviroquip, its US offshoot, failed to meet profit expectations due to cost overruns on industrial projects in the fourth quarter. Shipping and distribution, however, held up well. Group turnover fell to IPounds 97.5m (IPounds 128m), reflecting the absence of contributions from the Irish and UK environmental division which was sold in December 1990. Earnings per share were 31.9p (37p). A proposed final dividend of 8.5p makes a total of 12.5p (12p). Mr Denis Magee, chairman, said profits in the shipping division should be substantially up in the current year following the addition of a new vessel. Margins in engineering are extremely tight. The group has become progressively more conscious of the problem posed by its relatively-small size, he said, and is anxious to identify a sizeable acquisition.</p>

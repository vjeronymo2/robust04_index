			<p><P> December 22, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HEALTH CARE REFUNDS WILL BEGIN IN FEBRUARY;  </P> <P> MEDICARE: BENEFICIARIES PAYING FOR THE REPEALED CATASTROPHIC COVERAGE WILL GET  CHECKS TOTALING $21.20. A COMPUTER PROGRAM IS STILL DEDUCTING PREMIUMS.  </P> <P> The federal government will begin sending refunds in February to millions of  Medicare beneficiaries who continue paying premiums for the repealed  catastrophic care law, officials said Thursday.  </P> <P> The Treasury will make two payments of $10.60, in February and again in April,  for each Medicare enrollee, the Treasury and Social Security Administration  announced.  </P> <P> The total refund of $21.20 will compensate for the $5.30 a month premium that  will be deducted from Social Security checks each month from January through  April. Although the catastrophic care benefits end as of Jan. 1, Social  Security computers will continue making the premium deductions through April  because it takes months to rewrite instructions for such a massive computer  system.  </P> <P> The Social Security Administration first indicated that its computers could not  be corrected to stop the deductions until May or later. Officials originally  promised that a lump sum refund payment would be issued in the summer by the  Treasury, which prints and mails checks for government agencies.  </P> <P> But Social Security officials then consulted with outside experts and proposed  that refund checks be sent beginning in February. A dispute developed with  Treasury, which claimed that it would be difficult and costly to issue 28  million refund checks in addition to the normal monthly mailings.  </P> <P> The agencies settled their conflict Thursday.  </P> <P> "Today's announcement is great news for America's elderly, many of whom live on  fixed incomes," said Social Security Commissioner Gwendolyn S. King. "We are  working diligently to expedite the computer changes required to properly adjust  Social Security checks but we must be extremely careful not to destroy a  carefully constructed system of payments (providing) $19 billion a month," she  said.  </P> <P> She noted that the agency must alter "more than 150 different computer software  programs" to eliminate the $5.30 a month deduction.  </P> <P> The refunds will total an estimated $1.2 billion.  </P> <P> "We are pleased to assist (the Social Security Administration) in expeditiously  refunding these payments to senior citizens," said Treasury official W. E.  Douglas. The procedure "will provide the most timely service to recipients  without jeopardizing" the 250 million other payments disbursed by Treasury "at  this peak time of the year," Douglas said.  </P> <P> The service he heads handles Social Security payments, tax refunds, federal  salaries, veterans benefits and other government payments.  </P> <P> The repealed catastrophic care law, passed by Congress enthusiastically in  1988, was repudiated with equally intense fervor 17 months later. It provided  expanded hospital care, a ceiling on payments for doctor bills and coverage of  prescription drugs.  </P> <P> But its financing mechanism -- the monthly premium and a surtax on those over  65 who pay federal income taxes -- proved politically fatal. The surtax, which  would have touched about 40% of those over 65, was resented as an unfair levy  on a narrow segment of the population. Complaints from angry Medicare  beneficiaries, many of whom already had supplemental health insurance, forced  an abrupt turnaround in Congress. It voted in November to scrap the entire  catastrophic care program.  </P></p>

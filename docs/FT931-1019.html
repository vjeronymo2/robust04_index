			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Watchdog praises sale of BT shares THE SALE of the second tranche of British Telecom shares at the end of 1991 gave the taxpayer value for money, but the National Audit Office, the parliamentary watchdog, says it could not say whether the government's special efforts to boost the number of long-term small investors had worked. In a report on the Pounds 5.3bn sale of half the government's remaining BT shares, the audit office says the government did 'all it could' to maximise proceeds. The office reaches no judgment on the success of the share shop scheme - intended to make it easier for small investors to deal in shares - beyond noting that 59 per cent of the shops' transactions in the three-month special dealing period after the sale were on behalf of individuals disposing of BT shares.</p>

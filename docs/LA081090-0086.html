			<p><P> August 10, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO;  </P> <P> LONGER DAY FOR SOME 8TH-GRADERS  </P> <P> Some junior high students in the Capistrano Unified School District will have a  longer school day, thanks to a decision by the Board of Trustees this week to  add an extra period to the school day as part of a new eighth-grade science  requirement.  </P> <P> Beginning in the fall of 1991, eighth-graders will be required to take a  semester of science but may voluntarily take the class as a zero or seventh  period.  </P> <P> District officials are offering the extra period to students who might be  forced to drop elective classes during the normal school day to meet the  science requirement.  </P> <P> Board members approved the measure by a 6-1 vote. Trustee Annette Gude  dissented, saying that increased science requirements would force more  non-college bound students to drop out of school.  </P> <P> Gude also objected to a provision in the measure requiring parents to provide  transportation for students taking the extra class. Children whose parents  could not provide transportation would be forced to take the class during the  day, she said. But Asst. Supt. Bill Eller said that extra bus service would  cost $160,000 each school year. CHERYLANNE BEALER  </P></p>

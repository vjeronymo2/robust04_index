He  gave no information about the timetable of the review, but  added: "We have to be extremely careful about the introduction  of the new property gains tax and ensure that foreign investors'  confidence will not be hit."    Property development is one of the largest industries on  Hainan island, one of China's five special economic zones.  Hainan has set up more than 140 development zones throughout the  province.

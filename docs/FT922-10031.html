			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / Survey of Danish Shipping and Shipbuilding (3): Moller heads fleet - Profile of a shipping group leader THERE ARE 36 columns under 'Moller' in the Copenhagen telephone directory, but as far as most Danes are concerned there is only one Mr Moller. His full name is Maersk McKinney Moller. Mr Moller runs the A. P. Moller shipping, shipbuilding, oil, gas and manufacturing group, which operates one of the world's largest privately-owned merchant shipping fleets and is by far the largest Danish industrial enterprise. The group was founded by Mr Moller's father, Arnold Peter Moller and grandfather, Captain Peter Maersk Moller, in 1904. Under Mr McKinney Moller's stewardship, the group has grown steadily stronger and larger. Turnover in 1991 was DKr23.4bn, equity capital DKr16.2bn, and assets DKr30.2bn. The market value of the group's twin parent companies, D/S 1912 and D/S Svendborg, is about DKr39bn. The A. P. Moller fleet, which sails under the Maersk name and is easily recognisable by the seven-pointed star against a blue background, comprises about 150 vessels, ranging from container ships, through crude oil tankers, gas carriers, car carriers, roll on/roll off ships and bulk carriers, to offshore supply and service vessels (but no passenger vessels). Maersk also operates a fleet of about 50 oil drilling rigs and barges. Mr Moller, who will be 79 this year, is still very much in control and takes a detailed interest in the group's multifarious activities. However, in 1991, Mr Moller, who has no son to follow him, announced that he will be withdrawing 'in a couple of years' and he appointed Mr Jess Soderberg as the senior partner and his eventual successor. Mr Moller expects and receives the complete loyalty of his staff, who respond enthusiastically to the tough demands made upon them by the head of the group. The country's politicians are not always so amenable to Mr Moller's wishes. At the start of the crisis which led to the Gulf War, while political Denmark dithered about the extent of the country's support for the campaign against Iraq, Mr Moller made space on ships from his fleet available to the US government, free of charge, to ship military equipment to the Gulf. It was his personal means of thanking the Americans for past generosity to Europe, as well as a well-timed side-swipe at the Danish politicians for their tardiness. He caused a few raised eyebrows at home after declaring publicly his uneasiness about the fact that, under the Maastricht treaty on European union, Denmark will be sacrificing part of her hereditary sovereignty and that 'a much larger and gradually rather aggressive Germany' will become more dominant. Some of those who want Denmark to vote against the ratification of the Maastricht treaty in the referendum that the country is holding on June 2 thought they had found an unexpected ally, but Mr Moller has disappointed them. In one of his very rare newspaper interviews, he made it clear in April that, despite some misgivings, he recommended a 'Yes' to Maastricht. Mr Moller has been involved in some dramatic clashes with the country's politicians. That happened most recently when a majority in the Folketing (parliament) in February turned down a Moller development plan for North Sea oilfields. In a letter to his employees, he described the two politicians responsible for the decision as incompetent and went on: 'Both gentlemen speak frequently, often incorrectly, and in conflict with facts of which they should be aware.' Nobody has ever been heard to cast doubt on Mr Moller's competence. The group's growth over the years is the proof. 'Constant care', a phrase coined as the group's watchword by Arnold Peter Moller, is regularly cited by Mr Moller as the watchword for everyone working for Moller companies. But it has been supplemented by a more modern phrase as a guide to performance: 'Zero faults.' It is not good enough to achieve 99.9 per cent success, for, as Mr Moller points out, with only 0.1 per cent errors the heart will still miss 32,000 beats a year. The spirit of Mr Moller's approach to his employees is caught well by the following quotation from his annual new year address to the staff at the Copenhagen seafront headquarters of the group: 'It is, however, already certain that 1992 is not going to be an easy year for us. We will have to work hard, get up early, tighten our belts and make a contribution second to none  .. Our domestic expense base is higher than that of most of our competitors, and it is only through greater competence, more ingenuity, continued diligence and, dare I say - constant care  - that we will be able to hold our own.' It will be the surprise of the year if they don't hold their own.</p>

			<p><P> September 29, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> The nations of Eastern Europe and Western Europe join forces Saturday for three  days to combat an onslaught of U.S. television serials and Japanese TV  technology. About 1,500 producers, directors and engineers from 27 nations will  gather in Paris to find ways of boosting European programs and television  technology. "What would remain of our cultural identity if audiovisual Europe  consisted of European consumers sitting in front of Japanese TV sets showing  American programs?" France's European Affairs Minister Edith Cresson said.  Foreign ministers from the European Community and other West European nations  plus the Soviet Union, Hungary, Poland and Yugoslavia will use the meeting as a  launch pad for joint production and distribution projects.

			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / International Company News: Portuguese telecoms merged Portugal's three state-owned telecommunications companies are to be merged today into a single unit. The new utility which will be the country's largest company, is to be partially privatised by mid-1995, government officials said yesterday. The creation of Portugal Telecom is the first step in a restructuring that will bring all the country's main telecommunications services under the management of a single state monopoly. The utility is to be progressively privatised but the state will keep a 'golden share,' enabling it to veto strategic decisions. Privatisation is to begin next year with a public offer of 25 to 30 per cent. The operator would later seek an international partner, officials said. Portugal Telecom will be formed from three companies: Telefones de Lisboa e Porto, which operates basic services in Lisbon and Oporto; Telecom Portugal, which runs services in the rest of the country and with Europe and the Mediterranean area; and Teledifusao Portuguesa, which beams television signals. Subsidiaries of the three companies that operate mobile telephone, cable television and data transmission services are also to be brought into the new utility. Portugal Telecom will have 22,000 employees and an estimated value of more than Es1,000bn. Radio Marconi, which operates Portugal's intercontinental telecommunications services, will subsequently be merged with Portugal Telecom. The officials said private investors, who own 49 per cent of Marconi, were expected to be given a choice of selling their shares to the state or exchanging them for shares in Portugal Telecom. The government has not yet decided whether to sanction a proposal for a Es30bn (Dollars 224m) management buy-out of Marconi's 40 overseas subsidiaries and its 33 per cent holding in Telecomunicacoes Moveis Nacionais, a state-controlled mobile telephone operator.</p>

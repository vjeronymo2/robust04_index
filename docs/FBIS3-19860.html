			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by former SPD Labor Minister Herbert Ehrenberg: </F> "Doubt About the Course of the Bundesbank; The German Economy  Now Needs a Sharp Interest Rate Cut"]    [Text] The west German economy lurches along; a review of  preliminary data shows an even worse underlying situation. The  gross domestic product shrank in the fourth quarter of 1993, by  0.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, and by 0.9 percent  compared to the previous year; equipment investments dropped by  2 percent; construction investments by 1.5 percent in real  terms. The number of unemployed also continued to grow in  February. With the exception of 1993, during the past ten years  the February figures of the labor market were always more  favorable than those in January.    In its monthly report of February 1994, the Bundesbank  states  that the "west German economy" continues to move "in a trough;"  according to this analysis, "the trends of weakness are now  concentrated in private consumption and investment activity."    Despite this depressing analysis, the Bundesbank leadership  seems to have no doubt whatsoever about its own policy. As late  as last week, Vice President Gaddum saw no cause for changes in  the course of monetary policy, and Bundesbank President  Tietmeyer warned against "employment-motivated currency  manipulations," at the same time rejecting all accusations that  the Bundesbank is coresponsible for the crisis in the industrial  base and underemployment.    But confrontations of the Bundesbank policy with overall  economic data and comparisons with monetary policy in the United  States raise many doubts about the course of the Bundesbank.  Although the real gross domestic product in the third quarter of  1991 shrank by 0.5 percent compared to the previous quarter and  equipment investments dropped by 2 percent, the Bundesbank in  August 1991 raised the discount rate from 6.5 to 7.5 percent. In  July 1992 (after an intermediate step), the discount rate  reached 8.75 percent, the highest ever in the Federal Republic.  Yet the gross domestic product and equipment investments in real  terms had been declining since the summer of 1991 from quarter  to quarter, with the exception of the first quarter of 1992.  However, only in March 1993 was the discount rate (after two  ministeps) lowered by half a point below the peak level of 8  percent--despite the continuing steep decline of the economy:  After a real decline of equipment investments by 3.5 percent in  the third quarter of 1992, the minus rate in the two following  quarters amounted to 5 and 5.5 percent, respectively.    The Bundesbank reports time and again praise the "continuity  of monetary policy." But it is highly questionable whether  applause is deserved by a continuity which, parallel to the  steep decline in growth, reached today's discount rate of 5.25  percent with nine "ministeps" over 15 months. Even after these  many miniscule operations, the discount rate is still above the  level of the summer of 1989--and at that time, the national  product grew by 4 percent in real terms. A six-point decline in  the growth rate clamors for a sharp lowering of interest rates.    In the Bundesbank's monetary policy argumentation, economic  growth and employment are ignored, the direction is set by the  (self-imposed) money supply goal, the exchange rate development  and the price level.    In the latter, the differences are only slight: The  cost-of-living price index rose in 1989 by 2.8 percent, and in  January 1994 by 3.5 percent. The Bundesbank itself lists the  rate of price increases at 2.5 percent, excluding tax increases  whose effects cannot be influenced by monetary policy.    Despite all fluctuations in economic development and their  various causes, Bundesbank policy since the mid-1970's is  primarily guided by its own money supply goals although, since  the glamor of monetarism is fading, the suitability of the money  supply as a monetary action indicator is more and more put into  question. Sensibly enough, there have been no wrong reactions to  the recent, extremely steep increase in the money supply; the  Bundesbank itself has cited a number of "special factors" as  explanation.  <H5>  Questionable Exchange Rate Orientation </H5>   Perhaps the (quickly passing) shock on the financial  markets,  after the announcement of the most recent money supply figures,  will finally lead to making this tool more relative in the  public eye. At the bottom of less than 80 percent capacity  utilization rate and a labor force reservoir of four to six  million, an expanded money supply cannot cause serious  disturbances. Any higher demand can easily be satisfied by the  existing underused production potential.    Economically even more questionable is the Bundesbank's  exchange rate orientation. Germany's high interest rate policy  in the summer of 1992 was the strongest cause of the EMS  [European Monetary System] currency turbulences, and German  exports were additionally affected by the subsequent revaluation  of the German mark [DM] amidst weak world market demand.  Although the Bundesbank reassuringly points to the corrections  made in the meantime, behind the average of these changes is  still concealed an almost 10-percent revaluation of the German  mark vis-a-vis EC currencies. The devaluations vis-a-vis the  U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen cannot compensate for that.    In economic terms, nothing speaks in favor of keeping the DM  exchange rate high in the European Union [EU] currency area. Due  to the 10-percent revaluation, the export industry suffered a  cost burden equivalent to a 10-percent wage increase. A sharp  lowering of standard interest rates would facilitate investment  financing, relieve exports and decrease the money supply, since  short-term investments would no longer be so attractive.    The FRG should learn from the U.S. example: In the United  States in 1992 and 1993, real growth rates of 2.6 and 3.0  percent were achieved with a discount rate of 3 percent, with  price increases of 3 percent each year. And after the last  discount hike (noted with great attention here), the U.S.  discount rate is still two full percentage points below that of  Germany. There are many good growth and stability reasons for  the Bundesbank to steer towards this level as rapidly as  possible.</p>

			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / Higher import prices hit manufacturing costs WORRIES about inflationary pressures intensified yesterday with news that the sliding pound contributed to a sharp rise in manufacturing costs last month. The cost of raw materials and fuels purchased by manufacturers rose by a seasonally adjusted 1.5 per cent in January compared with December, largely because of higher import prices. The Central Statistical Office said prices of these items last month were 7.2 per cent higher than a year previously, the highest year-on-year figure since May 1989. The year-on-year rise was well above City expectations, and compared with a figure of a revised 5.4 per cent for the 12 months to December. It reflected the continuing effects on import prices of the 15 per cent fall in the pound since Britain left the European exchange rate mechanism in September. Separately, the CSO said wholesale prices of manufactured products for the UK market, excluding food, drink and tobacco, rose last month by 2.7 per cent compared with January 1992. That was the biggest year-on-year rise since August and reflected companies' eagerness to increase prices for new-year sales programmes. In December the year-on-year rise was 2.4 per cent. The statistics increased expectations that the government's target for underlying inflation may be breached over the next year. The Treasury wants to keep the year-on-year increase in the retail prices index, excluding mortgage costs, at 4 per cent or less. Including food, drink and tobacco, the prices of which can be affected by changes in excise duties, the year-on-year rise in wholesale prices of manufactured products was 3.5 per cent in January, the same as in December. The rise in manufacturing costs between December and January resulted partly from increases in the price of UK-produced foods such as milk. Under European Community arrangements, payments to British farmers are automatically boosted should the pound fall. Prices of home-produced foods increased by 1.1 per cent last month compared with December while prices of imported foods went up 0.2 per cent. In each case these prices do not allow for seasonal fluctuations. Fuels excluding petroleum products rose in price over this period by 0.3 per cent while metals saw a price increase of 0.2 per cent. Since the pound left the ERM, prices of fuels and materials purchased by manufacturers have increased by a seasonally adjusted 5.6 per cent. But these extra cost pressures have been countered by relatively low rises in wages. Confidence among small to medium-sized companies is improving in Britain but declining in continental Europe, according to a survey by the 3i investment group and the Cranfield School of Management. The survey of 8,000 companies in Britain, France, Germany, Spain and Italy shows that many UK businesses believe the recession is ending. Businesses in the other nations are becoming more worried about sales prospects because of the deterioration in European economies, particularly in Germany.</p>

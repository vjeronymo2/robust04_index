			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Leo Delcroix became defense minister two years ago.  In these two years he has made far-reaching reforms in his  department. He wants to turn the Belgian Army into a  professional army, and also make it a more open body.    One measure in this direction concerns military command  files. The defense minister wants to involve parliament, and in  particular the president and vice president of the defense  committees, to a greater degree. They would have a ex post  facto right of examination, rather than only taking part in  consultations. Is this an opportunistic move at a time when  military orders are making headlines? Leo Delcroix denies this  is the case.    Openness will also mean the Army will be allowed to speak  out: From April 1994, military personnel will be able to express  themselves freely on all subjects except those relating to  discipline and military secrets. Previously, they had to obtain  authorization before speaking out.    On a broader level, the Army will make a greater effort to  keep the public informed. The Army must strengthen its ties  with the nation, Mr. Delcroix said. We must make ourselves more  attractive, as we are going to have to recruit, he said. This  recruitment drive is a consequence of the decision to abolish  military service.    Finally, 1994 will see an unprecedented number of new  postings in the Army. There will be 12,000 transfers this year  -- three times more than usual. This is mainly due to the  return of troops from Germany. The minister said he is  concerned about the personal situation of these soldiers, and  has announced his intention to create new housing, which will be  financed by rents paid by the Army.</p>

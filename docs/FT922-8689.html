			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / International Company News: Panel rules on Bass Strait oil royalties BROKEN Hill Proprietary (BHP) of Australia and Exxon of the US must pay ADollars 68.7m (USDollars 51.6m) in additional royalties and interest on their past oil production from Australia's Bass Strait fields, a panel of arbitrators has ruled, AP-DJ reports from Melbourne. The two companies have produced oil from the fields in a joint venture since 1969 and have paid ADollars 660m in royalties at a rate of 2.5 per cent of the value of output. Oil Basins Ltd receives and distributes the royalties. Nearly 10 years ago, the royalty holders started legal action seeking that the royalty be based on a calculation of value that included excise tax. BHP and Exxon disputed this claim, which could have involved ADollars 2bn, and the issue was submitted to arbitration. The arbitrators ruled in the oil producers' favour in 1987 when they said royalties should be determined after the deduction of excise tax. However, the panel only now has decided that certain payments by BHP and Exxon must be adjusted upward because the royalties are calculated on a different basis from that used when production started. As a result, BHP and Exxon must pay ADollars 32.4m in additional royalties for the period 1969-1988, together with ADollars 36.3m in interest.</p>

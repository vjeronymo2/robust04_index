			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> RSPA is particularly concerned that control center dispatchers and other operating personnel are adequately trained to recognize the abnormal operating conditions or the emergency conditions of proposed &sect;&sect;192.811(d)(4) and 195.511(d)(4). Further, RSPA is concerned that control center persons and other operating personnel are adequately trained in the appropriate reactions to restore abnormal operating conditions to normal conditions and are adequately trained in the appropriate reactions to prevent the development of emergency conditions. Additionally, in the proposed &sect;&sect;192.811(d)(5) and 195.511(d)(5), control center persons, and operating and emergency-response personnel must be adequately trained in the appropriate reactions to control emergency conditions or to mitigate the potential for personal injury, death, property damage, and environmental damage. Sections 192.811(d)(5) and 195.511(d)(5) would supplement the requirements of the current &sect;&sect;192.615 (Emergency plans) and 195.402 (Procedural manual for operations, maintenance, and emergencies).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under &sect;&sect;192.813 and 195.513, tests would have to be designed by the operator to demonstrate that personnel possess the knowledge and skills that training is intended to impart. Testing could be through any, or a combination of, written, hands-on, or oral methods appropriate for the function tested. For some functions, a suitable test might consist of observing ``hands-on'' performance supplemented by appropriate questioning. Operators must set the minimum acceptable test grade at a level that would demonstrate the knowledge and skills required to competently perform the function tested. Testing would be required for all persons performing covered functions including experienced personnel evaluated under &sect;&sect;192.809(a) and 195.509(a) to have met training requirements by equivalent prior training or experience. RSPA believes that testing is the only reasonable way to ensure that personnel possess the knowledge and skills required for qualification.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under these proposed regulations, qualification of an individual based on training and testing would not be a one-time event. Each time the pipeline safety regulations or the operator's procedures are changed or new ones are put into effect, operators would have to determine which persons may need additional training to carry out their covered functions under the new regulations or procedures. When further qualification training is required, it would have to be followed by a test. When qualification is required to comply with new or revised pipeline safety regulations, the qualification training and testing would have to be completed before the compliance dates specified in the rule and before the affected person begins performance of a covered function. A similar evaluation and timely qualification process would be required each time a person is given an operation, maintenance, or emergency-response assignment for which that person is not qualified. Until that person becomes qualified, the person must be accompanied and directed by a qualified person.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The requirement of existing &sect;195.403(a) that the training program be continuing would be made more definite under the proposed requirement for refresher training at intervals not to exceed 2 years. Under the proposed &sect;&sect;192.815 and 195.515, refresher training is intended to be a review of the general and the appropriate specific elements under &sect;&sect;192.811 and 195.511. The review may be accomplished by the same methods used for qualification training. However, there is no exception for prior experience or training evaluated as equivalent, as permitted in &sect;&sect;192.811(a) and 195.511(a). An existing requirement under &sect;195.403(c) requires hazardous liquid operators to require and verify that their supervisors maintain a thorough knowledge of that portion of the procedures established under &sect;195.402 (Procedural manual for operations, maintenance, and emergencies). This requirement would not be continued in its present form under the proposed qualification standards because it is less rigorous than the proposed requirement that affected personnel be qualified. Moreover, an existing requirement under &sect;195.403(b) concerning review of personnel performance relative to the objectives of the training program would be carried forward into proposed competency reviews under &sect;&sect;192.817(e) and 195.517(e).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purpose of competency reviews is to evaluate the effectiveness of qualification training, testing, and refresher training by reviewing the performance of personnel involved with covered functions which resulted in reportable accidents and other nonreportable events. The nonreportable events would be deaths, personal injuries, property damage, or damage to the environment, any of which may have occurred without a release of the gas, hazardous liquid, or carbon dioxide, or otherwise did not meet the threshold limits for reportable gas incidents under &sect;191.5 or reportable liquid accidents under &sect;195.50. Among other such events would be violation of operating procedures, and abnormal operating conditions or emergency conditions as set out in the proposed &sect;&sect;192.811(d)(4)-(d)(5) and &sect;&sect;195.511(d)(3)-(d)(4).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

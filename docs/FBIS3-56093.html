			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Ravil Zaripov article under "Topic of Day" rubric: "You </F> Cannot Become Speaker Without a Voice"]    [Text] Yesterday's work of the Federation Council acquired  a scandalous, sensational complexion. Vladimir Shumeyko, for  whom the chair of Federation Council chairman had already been  prepared, failed to get it by one vote, having secured the  support of 85 deputies (it is noteworthy that one voting paper  was not dropped into the box but was taken away). The previous  day Shumeyko had been thought sure to win, since in the secret  nomination of candidacies he had collected 78 votes, whereas his  closest rival in terms of the number of votes had just 13 (Petr  Romanov, general director of Krasnoyarsk's "Yenisey" Chemical  Combine Production Association).    Meanwhile, Shumeyko had been confidently answering any  questions, not being diffident. "My daughter is working in the  United States, and my grandson is a U.S. citizen. This is how  it has worked out." At the same time another candidate --  Eduard Rossel -- was posing as someone "humiliated and  insulted," persecuted by the central power. According to the  deputies' reaction, he did not win any sympathy with this.  Moreover, the senators categorically disliked the allusion that  he made: What has happened to me is just the beginning, and you  will see there is worse to come. Rossel did not forget to make  digs at Shumeyko, getting at his moves from one branch of power  to another. As a result, in the admission of deputies, some of  the votes "flowed" from Rossel to Romanov.    Nobody doubts that Shumeyko will be elected. But what will  such a choice mean? That the majority of the regions  (voluntarily or compulsorily) will go along with the president  and the government and will support its policy. Deputy Aman  Tuleyev believes that in this situation the Federation Council  is being turned virtually "into a presidential council." Can  they, however, vote differently when 54 percent of the deputies  are administration heads, to whom are added people on the  president's team and economic planners dependent on the center?  According to Aman Tuleyev and Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, there was  strong individual pressure [obrabotka] on deputies. Since the  budget for 1994 has not yet been adopted, and the majority need  subsidies, direct investments, and quotas, it is obvious what  the subtext of such talk is. Let us not forget that the  administration heads who received deputies' mandates from their  voters had, at the same time, been appointed by the president.  Boris Yeltsin appointed them and can also remove them: The  Bryansk "experience" of former Administration Head Yu. Lodkin  will be remembered for a long time. According to Karelian  Supreme Soviet Chairman Viktor Stepanov, it is important that  the Federation Council does not turn into an ideological  department or tool of the president. Not that the threat of  this is that great, since, when the talk turns to specific  questions -- the budget, for example -- the administration heads  might be transformed. The reason? If contradictions arise  between the regions and the center, their actual responsibility  to their own district could outweigh the pressure from the  government. I have ascertained from conversations with  administration heads that they also want Shumeyko to be elected  because "he is the only person who will be able to control us.  If Romanov is elected, the same situation as with the former  Supreme Soviet will be repeated."    The second round of the secret vote intensified the  sensation  which had become apparent. Petr Romanov got 79 votes and  Vladimir Shumeyko 81 votes. The reason for this was Yu.  Chernichenko in the chair and...Shumeyko himself.    After the results of the first round of voting were  announced, the former attempted to "quash" an additional vote  for Vladimir Shumeyko, referring to a telegram received from  North Ossetian Supreme Soviet Chairman Askharbek Galazov. The  deputies objected categorically. It unexpectedly came to light  that the telegram had been sent not to the chairman of the  tellers commission but to the president of Russia and directly  to Vladimir Shumeyko. Instead of getting up and removing the  tension which had arisen in the hall, Vladimir Shumeyko stayed  silent and so lost votes.</p>

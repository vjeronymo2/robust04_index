			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Mid-States plans fund raising and US quote Mid-States, the US motor parts distributor quoted on the USM, has announced plans to go ahead with a delayed issue of some Dollars 15m (Pounds 9.4m) in new ordinary shares in the US along with the implementation of an American Depositary Receipt programme. It also plans to list on Nasdaq to expand its US shareholder base. Shares in the company, which operates through its subsidiary Mid-State Automotive Distributors of Nashville, Tennessee, rose 3p to 78p yesterday. Mr Paul Dumond, company secretary, said the move to a US listing was because of 'a general lack of interest from London investors in small US businesses'. The company might also seek a full quote in London. The funds raised from the US issue will be used to pay off bank debts of Dollars 23m and to help the acquisition of distribution centres and retail stores throughout the US. It bought two businesses in Mississippi for Dollars 2.8m in April. Mid-States also reported a 21 per cent fall in pre-tax profits for the third quarter to September 30, from Pounds 2m to Pounds 1.6m, Pounds 230,000 of which was attributed to the losses in acquired businesses. Turnover increased by 28 per cent to Pounds 21.8m (Pounds 17.1m). In the nine months turnover improved 22 per cent to Pounds 58.7m (Pounds 48m) while pre-tax profits rose by just 5 per cent to Pounds 4.85m (Pounds 4.61m). Earnings per share dropped to 2.7p (3.7p) in the quarter and to 7.4p (8.2p) for the nine months after an increased tax charge. There has been no dividend so far this year - a total of 0.75p was paid in 1993.</p>

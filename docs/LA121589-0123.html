			<p><P> December 15, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> First Interstate Ratings Lowered: Duff &amp; Phelps, a Chicago investment  research firm, said it lowered its ratings on First Interstate Bancorp amid new  problems at the banking company's Texas unit. The ratings affect about $3  billion in First Interstate's senior debt, subordinated debt and preferred  stock. Duff &amp; Phelps said that although First Interstate's operations are  strong in California, Oregon, Washington and Nevada, the banking firm's problem  assets will continue to hurt profits.  </P></p>

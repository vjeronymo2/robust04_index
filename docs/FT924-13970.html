			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / Foreign Exchanges: DM tensions may not be over THE DOLLAR closed weaker against the D-Mark at the end of European trading yesterday, as dealers digested Mr Alan Greenspan's weekend comments expressing concern at the lack of economic growth in the US, writes James Blitz. At the end of last week, analysts asserted that the 6.5 percentage point differential between US and German interest rates had widened to its fullest extent, and that the heavy investment in D-Marks might subside. The dollar was well supported on that view. Yesterday, despite a quiet day in the markets because of the Columbus Day vacation in the US, there were signs that an easing in the differential is not imminent. The chairman of the US Federal Reserve said that no US monetary policy initiative could be ruled out, and the dollar fell in Monday's Asian trading to DM1.4610. In Europe, it regained its poise, but closed 1 1/2 pfennigs down on the previous close at DM1.4720. An 11 basis point drop in the December Euromark futures contract signalled a revision away from the thinking that the Bundesbank will cut rates at its council meeting on Thursday. The market was over-optimistic about the prospects for a cut at the last Bundesbank council meeting, and people are still divided over how the German central bank is responding to the recession. Mr Ian Beauchamp, chief economist at Hambros Bank in London, believes that a German rate cut will come soon and that there will be 7 per cent interest rates in Germany by the end of 1993. Mr Steve Hannah, chief economist at the International Bank of Japan in London, is more cautious. 'The market is too far ahead of the Bundesbank,' he said. Uncertainties on German policy may be gently undermining the French franc, which closed down more than a centime yesterday at FFr3.40. compared to its ERM floor of FFr3.4305 against the D-Mark. The franc, the benchmark of currency stability in Europe, could still survive in the ERM without a devaluation. But the franc's defence has left French commercial banks borrowing money from the authorities at a rate several points higher than their own lending rates. 'All the good news about German rates is already in the market,' said Mr Hannah, 'and, if the French ease rates now, it's hard to see where they can go next.' Sterling was barely affected by Mr Norman Lamont's appearance before the Treasury Committee of the House of Commons. Mr John Hall, an economist at Swiss Banking Corporation in London, spoke for several analysts when he said that that there was nothing new in the speech barring the restatement of a highly pragmatic economic policy. The pound closed down against the D-Mark at DM2.51.</p>

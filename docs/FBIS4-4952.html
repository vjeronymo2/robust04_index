			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Pu Chi-yong from Tokyo] </F>   [Text] YOMIURI SHIMBUN reported that as part of a means  for possible economic sanctions in connection with the North  Korean nuclear issue, the Japanese authorities are discussing  the possibility of suspending trade with North Korea and  prohibiting the members of the pro-North Korean residents'  league in Japan from going to North Korea. YOMIURI SHIMBUN  added that amid this kind of situation, the ship,  Mangyongbong-92, which uses one of the routes used for sending  money to North Korea left Niigata port, Japan for Wonsan, North  Korea on 30 March.    It is the third time that Mangyongbong-92 set sail from  Japan  this year. After loading cargo at Niigata port on 28 March,  Mangyongbong-92 set sail on 30 March at around 1000.    Mangyongbong-92, which set sail from Niigata port, arrived  26  hours later in Wonsan. Members of the pro-North Korean  residents' league in Japan use this ship, which can carry up to  250 people. It is also being used to transport cargo.    It was learned that in 1993 Mangyongbong-92 entered Niigata  port on 25 occasions. It transported about 5,000 members of the  pro- North Korean residents' league in Japan to North Korea and  various cargo.    YOMIURI SHIMBUN pointed out that if the UN Security Council  decides to carry out economic sanctions against North Korea and  thus prohibits Japanese trade with North Korea and pro-North  Korean residents league in Japan from visiting North Korea,  there is a high possibility that Mangyongbong-92 will not be  able to enter Japan any longer.</p>

			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / US Money and Credit: Conflicting economic signals bring volatility THE VOLATILITY in bond prices says it all. After a lacklustre first half of the year, the US economy has been throwing off conflicting signals in recent weeks. Signs that the halting economic recovery may be picking up speed, alternating with renewed evidence of the recovery's weakness, have made the market jittery and big price movements common. The bond market is still looking for the evidence that will either propel yields on long-dated bonds decisively below 6 per cent or finally bring an end to the bond market rally. September employment figures, due on Friday, could help to determine which way the market will turn. Last Friday's movement in prices summed up the recent mood. A sharp jump in the August index of leading indicators, to 1 per cent, suggested a quickening in the economic pulse: the index had grown only 0.1 per cent in June and July, and fallen in the two previous months. Bond prices slid on the news. But the regular survey from the National Association of Purchasing Management which followed later in the day pointed to the slow pace of manufacturing growth. The NAPM index rose to 49.7 during September, from 49.3 in August (which was itself a fall from the 49.5 of July). Recovery, perhaps, but hardly striking: the bond market regained some of its confidence. After all the choppiness in the market, bond yields ended little changed and still close to the psychologically important 6 per cent level. The benchmark 30-year US Treasury long bond ended the week higher than it had started, at a yield of 5.99 per cent, compared with 6.03 per cent at the beginning. Other straws in the wind also point to the lacklustre pace of recovery. After the collapse of new bank lending in 1991 and 1992, virtually any increase in bank credit growth has the potential to look dramatic. Therefore, it is as well to be cautious about the Dollars 5.8bn growth in bank lending in the latest reporting week, following the three-week decline that preceded it. However, the make-up of that credit growth may be instructive: Dollars 1.1bn was in the form of personal loans, while Dollars 4.7bn was real estate lending. This figure represented lending for residential rather than commercial real estate, but there have also been suggestions recently that the banks are beginning to overcome their commercial real estate phobia. These latest bank lending figures bear out the picture for far this year: consumer loans have provided all the growth, rising consistently since the first quarter of the year. Commercial and industry loans, by comparison, have continued to edge downwards. Large companies have chosen to finance themselves through the capital markets. Smaller companies, meanwhile, have reduced their borrowings. Nevertheless, with bank balance sheets primed with new capital after the bust at the start of the decade, and signs that lending is picking up in some sectors, the stage seems set for steady (if not dramatic) lending growth in the months ahead, helping to support the recovery. August's employment data, which showed an unexpected fall in non-farm payrolls of 39,000, helped to spur the bond market rally. However, September figures to be published this week are widely expected to have just the opposite effect. Salomon Brothers, for instance, is projecting an increase in non-farm payrolls of 225,000, while Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette predicts a 175,000 rise. Both point to an expected pick-up in employment in services industries. On a less positive note for the economy, though, both predict a slight fall in working hours during September.</p>

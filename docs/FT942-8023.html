Steffi Graf, who has won four straight grand slams and should again sweep through the women's singles. Her path is clear of young challengers. Jennifer Capriati (18) entered drug rehabilitation last week and even though Monica Seles (20) seems to have recovered physically from her stab wounds, she shows little interest in returning to the sport. SUNDAY: Formula One motor racing resumes its gloomy season with the Spanish Grand Prix at Jarama, after the deaths of Ayrton Senna and Roland Ratzenberger at Imola in Italy and Karl Wendlinger's crash in Monte Carlo. The F1 teams are struggling to modify their complicated cars to meet new safety rules by Sunday.

Army Commander General  Guillermo Paredes Hernandez revealed that studies show that to  make military service attractive and appealing one need lots of  money -- approximately 180 million lempiras. He explained that  new battalions will not be formed, and the present ones one will  continue to be used. Perhaps, though, some reforms will be  implemented. He made it clear, however, that this is not  definite.    When asked if Armed Forces Commander General Luis Alonso  Discua Elvir's statement "voluntarily -- only to the movies"  denoted a confrontation between the civilian and military  powers, Paredes said that there is no confrontation nor any  intention to begin one. "On the contrary, we came here to  promote a civilized, high-level dialogue so that together we can  all make the correct recommendations. Moreover, we are setting a  precedent and an example for the rest of society: that we can  find the correct solutions to all the problems we face if we  cooperate, discuss, and talk things over with one another," he  pointed out.    Paredes recalled the problem the Armed Forces are currently  facing with regard to the number of soldiers. The law stipulates  that all soldiers who have served two years must be discharged,  and the number of new recruits does not equal the number of  soldiers currently in the barracks. Paredes explained that  during the meeting he presented a study dealing with a large  number of issues, including the budget increase that would be  necessary to implement the plan. "The Army is engaged in such  tasks as fighting forest fires and patrolling the borders where  international armed groups, who often surpass the capabilities  of the police, are present," he said. "We are used in these  tasks and others, like the war against drug trafficking. Among  other things, we are now getting ready to provide security while  many people travel outside the city for the weekend," he  concluded.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Another working-level contact between North Korea  and the United States for the settlement of the North Korean  nuclear issue was held in New York early this morning, three  days after the previous contact.    The contact was held after North Korea had announced it  would  allow International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] inspections.  The following is a report by correspondent Nam Son-hyon from  New York:    [Begin Nam recording] The United States and North Korea had  a chief and counselor-level working contact for over an hour  early this morning to discuss allowing additional inspections  [chuga sachal] and the third round of high-level talks.    As the contact was held only a few days after the previous  contact on Tuesday and right after the IAEA's announcement of  its decision to send an inspection team, a well-informed source  said that this implies that a breakthrough will be provided soon  through U.S.-North Korea negotiations.    The source said that there had been very positive contents  in  today's working-level contact noting that the United States  reiterated its position on the inspection of fuel rods, which  was also mentioned in the previous contact, and that North Korea  responded to this.    During today's working-level contact, the United States  urged  that additional inspections should be properly conducted and  stressed that the schedule of the third-round high-level talks  should be discussed in the course of observing the development  of inspections. North Korea reportedly demanded to hold the  third- round talks as soon as possible since additional  inspections and regular inspections [chonggi sachal] will be  conducted.    The two sides reportedly decided to let the problem  concerning inspections of fuel rods be technically solved  between the IAEA and North Korea, and to hold another full-scale  working-level contact on the third-round talks next week when  inspections will be under way.

			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Redundancy costs cut Hoskyns to Pounds 9.5m HOSKYNS GROUP, the computing services company in which Cap Gemini Sogeti of France has a majority stake, saw pre-tax profits fall sharply last year as increased competition and restructuring costs acted to force down margins. CGS also announced that it was likely to be offering 469p each for the outstanding shares. It was a condition of its 1990 purchase of a 69.5 per cent holding that it make a further offer within three months of the 1992 preliminary announcement for the remaining shares. The shares closed unchanged at 451p. For the year to October 31 profits fell 34 per cent to Pounds 9.5m (Pounds 14.3m) after redundancy costs of Pounds 2.5m. Turnover fell slightly to Pounds 197.7m (Pounds 200.7m). Mr Geoff Unwin, chairman, said if allowance was made for the run down of facilities management contracts at Plessey, Hoskyns' former majority holder, and disposals, the underlying turnover growth was 6 per cent. Earnings per share were down at 5.8p (10.5p). A final dividend of 1.65p is proposed for an unchanged total of 2.4p. Hoskyns is UK market leader in outsourcing or facilities management, one of the fastest growing areas in data processing. The company signed twice as many outsourcing contracts in 1992 as in 1991. The forward order book is worth Pounds 175m. Mr Unwin said he did not expect to see any increase in the amount spent on computing in 1993, but it would be distributed differently with outsourcing attracting a growing share.</p>

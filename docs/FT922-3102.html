			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / Government Bonds: Dealers switch into Dutch, German paper THE D-Mark currency bloc saw firm buying interest yesterday as dealers and investors continued to switch out of the high-yielding European bond markets into German and Dutch government paper. The German market kicked off on a weak note, after Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the deputy president of the Bundesbank, was reported as saying that monetary growth was still too high, and ruled out a relaxation of monetary policy. But bund prices were pulled up later by the US Treasury bond market which opened on a firm note. The Liffe bund futures contract opened at 88.29, reached a low of 88.17 and ended the day at around 88.37. Traders reported some switching out of medium-dated bund issues into the longer-dated maturities with the result that long-dated bunds out-performed the other maturities. News that Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, had said Germany would not permit the convergence criteria for the European Monetary Union (EMU) agreed in Maastricht to be diluted, also helped the D-Mark sector, traders said. Dutch government bonds ended firmer, following strong buying interest particularly for the longer-dated issues. The government's latest 8.25 per cent bond due June 2002 closed up 12 cents at 99.87, while the yield fell to 8.27 per cent from 8.29 per cent. DOMESTIC buying on weakness helped to lift UK government bond prices yesterday with the Liffe futures contract trading up from its opening level of 97.28 to end at around 97.31. Volumes in the futures market were above-average at 30,000 contracts. The benchmark 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07 rose from 116 1/32 to end at 116 1/4 , but supply concerns continued to depress longer-dated issues before the Bank of England's next auction. US Treasuries rose yesterday in thin trading with the market receiving some support from signs of a slow economic recovery. In late trading, the Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond was  7/32 higher at 101 11/32 , yielding 7.878 per cent, while the two-year note was  3/32 higher, yielding 5.057 per cent. The Federal Reserve refrained from any open mar ket intervention, with Fed funds trading at 3 13/16 per cent. Fed Funds changed hands at 3 3/4 per cent in late trading. Turnover picked up briefly on signs of continued economic sluggishness following slower than expected May retail sales. The Commerce Department reported a rise of 0.2 per cent in the month, below the 0.7 per cent analysts had looked for. The market also took strength from signs of an inert labour market from the jobless claims numbers for the week ended May 30, which were unchanged at 407,000. Analysts had expected a decline of about 7,000 to reflect the Memorial Day holiday in the week. JAPANESE government bonds traded up during the day, though dealers said there were few fresh factors to move the market ahead of the Bank of Japan's quarterly Tankan report. The Tankan, which will be released today, is expected to show that the Japanese economy is slowing. The benchmark No 129 opened with a yield of 5.51 per cent and closed at 5.475 per cent, corresponding to the highest level of the day, while the futures contract rose from 101.82 to 101.90. Short-term interest rates slipped, with the rate on three-month certificates of deposit falling from 4.67 per cent to 4.65 per cent, their lowest level in over three years.</p>

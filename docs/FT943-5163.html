			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / Brussels probes VW deal The European Commission said yesterday it would investigate a plan by Volkswagen to acquire Sachsische Automobilbau (SAB), a former East German state-owned car factory, from the Treuhand privatisation agency. Brussels said the German carmaker's bid for 87.5 per cent of SAB's shares could fall under its merger rules, but reserved a final decision. In July, it cleared the way for VW to receive around DM1.2bn in subsidies toward its investment in SAB. The Commission has four weeks to decide whether the link-up could harm competition. If it finds 'serious doubts' about the transaction, it must launch a deeper probe.</p>

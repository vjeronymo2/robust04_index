			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / More BAe jobs expected to go ANOTHER round of job cuts is likely at the military aircraft division of British Aerospace, which has already announced significant closures and job cuts. BAe confirmed yesterday that a further review of its Warton unit in Lancashire - encompassing sites at Warton, Preston and Samlesbury - is under way as 'part of the continuing review of the business situation'. The company was responding to a press report that the loss of 2,500 design and development jobs at the unit would be announced today. The Warton unit is working on the Tornado, Hawk and European Fighter Aircraft (EFA) programmes. BAe announced more than a year ago that it was to cut 3,000 manufacturing and manufacturing-related jobs at the Warton unit and closing the Preston site, reducing employment at the unit to 11,000. Preston will close early next year.</p>

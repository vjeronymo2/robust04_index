			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / Educational dawn in California: America California has a habit of anticipating the future. In 1978, the success of Proposition 13, an initiative demanding lower property taxes, set off a global movement towards lower tax rates. In a state-wide ballot on November 2, Californian voters will be asked to pass judgment on Proposition 174, an educational initiative of comparable importance. Market-oriented reformers have long queried the public sector's near monopoly of education. The issue is not the need for public subsidies for elementary and secondary education (that is axiomatic) but whether governments should own schools and employ teachers. In theory, the education budget could be turned over to families in the form of 'school vouchers.' Parents would spend the vouchers at privately-run schools of their choice. The educational world would then reap all the natural benefits of competition - startling technical innovations, remarkable cost efficiency and a variety of teaching methods. Proposition 174, the Parental Choice in Education Initiative, would turn this theory into practice. It says all parents should be given tax-exempt vouchers, redeemable at private schools for about Dollars 2,600 (Pounds 1,730) (roughly half California's per pupil annual expenditure on education) or at existing public-sector schools, for the full Dollars 5,200. Several states have experimented with the kind of reforms introduced in Britain, which offer limited parental choice within the public sector. But, barring a small experiment in Milwaukee, none has contemplated giving parents vouchers redeemable in private schools. That California is even considering breaking this taboo is a reflection of the intense strains posed by the explosive growth of its school-age population. On some estimates, the state will need to open a new 600-pupil school every day for the next 10 years. Californians, of course, also share national concerns about the low quality of public-sector schools, despite a 29 per cent increase in inflation-adjusted spending per pupil since 1983 and a decade of non-stop education 'reform'. Last week, the US Education Department released a report indicating that nearly half of all adults lack elementary skills in reading, writing and arithmetic. The likely effects of Proposition 174 are hotly debated. Opponents, led by the financially powerful teachers' unions, say it would bankrupt the public-school system. Taxpayers would have to fork out Dollars 2,600 for every student that left for the private sector; at the margin, however, savings would fall far short of this because of the high level of overheads (for example the cost of buildings and redundancy pay for obsolete teachers). Meanwhile, parents of students already educated privately would receive an unnecessary subsidy that would only inflate fees in the private sector. The gap between haves and have nots would widen. Supporters dismiss such fears. Provided the number of students leaving the public sector substantially exceeds the 10 per cent or so already educated privately, the initiative ought to save money. This is because the proposed subsidy for each privately educated pupil is only half the current cost of education in the public sector. Since budgetary woes preclude a rapid expansion of public-sector education, financial incentives to promote new private schools are exactly the right response to current demographic pressures. The injection of real competition into a system that has failed, say enthusiasts, cannot help but improve educational standards. Will Proposition 174 succeed? Close observers of the Californian political scene, such as Mr Bruce Cain of the Institute for Government Studies at Berkeley, are doubtful. He says Proposition 13 succeeded because people expected it to bring immediate benefits - lower taxes. The impact of Proposition 174 is far harder to gauge: nobody knows how many students might shift out of the public sector or what this might do to public finances; the only clear beneficiaries are parents already paying for private schools. Given the complexities, he says, voters are likely to take their lead from the public figures who line up for and against the proposition. The danger is that it will become too closely identified with right-wingers and religious fundamentalists - liabilities in a state that returned two liberal Democratic senators in last year's election. Even if Proposition 174 fails, it will force many people to think seriously about the merits of vouchers. In the affluent late 20th century why should the average family expect taxpayers to bear all the cost of education? It is no use complaining that education is 'different' because much is already provided commercially, for example through book publication and television documentaries. Nor can privatised education be rejected as unfair: every school system is already unjust because the best schools are invariably located in the richest areas. The issue is not fairness but whether the normal action of market forces should be permitted to improve the average quality of schools, thus benefiting even the poorest children. With luck Proposition 174 might even embarrass Messrs Clinton and Gore. In spite of the hype about 'reinventing government' they are reluctant in the face of union opposition even to promote increased parental choice in the public sector.</p>

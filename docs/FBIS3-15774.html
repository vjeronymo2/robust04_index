			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Oleg Panfilov: "Representatives of Authorities </F> and Opposition To Meet in Moscow Unless There Is a Power Change  in the Republic"]    [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] One member of the Tajik  opposition, Khodzhi Akbar Turadzhonzoda, former head of the  republic's Spiritual Administration of Muslims, former People's  Deputy and member of the presidium of Tajikistan Supreme Soviet,  gave NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA a brief telephone interview.    [Turadzhonzoda] We are grateful to Russian diplomats for  their efforts in preparing talks. I think that Russia has  realized its responsibility and its place in regional policy.  We have always been and remain advocates of close and friendly  relations with Russia. We are together with democrats of  Russia, together with those who campaign for the observance of  human rights and the rights of nations to self-determination.  We are especially pleased at the visit of Anatoliy Adamishin,  with whom we have struck understanding on many questions.  Distressing is the position of the Russian military, which does  not want a peaceful resolution of the conflict; this is attested  to by the threats of punitive operations against residents of  the Garm group of rayons and against refugees in Afghanistan.    [Panfilov] What conditions do you set for holding talks in  Moscow?    [Turadzhonzoda] First and foremost are guarantees of  security for participants in the talks, as well as for their  relations who are on the territory of Tajikistan and in CIS  countries. The ruling out of all pressure on the negotiating  process from whichever side. Especially, the cutting short of  attempts to scuttle the talks on the part of the joint command  of the military contingent stationed in Tajikistan, as well as  holding no exercises in the "Tigrovaya Balka" nature preserve,  and actions against residents of the Garm group of rayons and  refugees in Afghanistan. [interview ends]    In line with the agreement, taking part in the talks will be  six persons on each side -- the opposition and the present  authorities in Tajikistan. It is so far unknown whether Khodzhi  Akbar Turadzhonzoda and, from the opposition, Mukhammadsharif  Khimmatozoda, chairman of the Islamic Party of Revival, will  come along. The others will be from the so-called moderate  opposition. The government group's composition is still unknown.  [passage omitted]</p>

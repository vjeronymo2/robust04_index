In an article published today, the newspaper says: While the  Iraqi leadership's envoy meets with the UN secretary general  again to put him in the picture of the situation, he is aware  that the UN secretary general knows how far Iraq has implemented  its obligations and the nature of the effective cooperation  shown by Iraq throughout the past years. The envoy wants to  emphasize to the secretary general the importance of activating  the performance of the international organization in a manner  that ends the pressuring and dictating policy imposed on it.    The newspaper says the Iraqi message of facts that reviewed  Iraq's commitment to the text and spirit of UN resolutions in  accordance with the sequence of paragraphs of these resolutions,  and the state of dismay demonstrated by the representatives of  Washington and London, have accurately reflected the extent of  infraction and insistence on harming Iraq and the Iraqi people.  This also showed the extent of hatred and arrogance that is  pursued by Washington and its subservient agents.    AL-THAWRAH adds it has become visible to all that the first  and final objective is a political one, and that the subject is  more than a commitment to the spirit of resolutions in spite of  the injustice and haphazardness of these resolutions.    It adds that briefing the Security Council on the facts and  asking it to abide by what it approved has exposed everything.  Silence is no longer acceptable, and this has been recently  echoed by several permanent members who admitted the positive  Iraqi steps.    AL-THAWRAH concludes by stressing that this new change is  based on Iraq's steadfastness, firmness, and the jihad and  courage of its people in patiently enduring afflictions. The  coming days will bring news about the greatest victory over the  tyrant and the collapse of the siege of the unjust.</p>

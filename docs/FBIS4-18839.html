			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Industry Minister Gerard Longuet by Yves </F> Messarovitch and Georges Potriquet; place and date not given:  "China Must Accept All the Rules of the World Trade  Organization"]    [Text] [LE FIGARO] Is the Europe-U.S. alliance on the  subject of the social clause not likely to produce a blocking  move in Marrakesh by the developing countries, which have  already swallowed the other requirements in the spheres of  agriculture and the environment?    [Longuet] In the framework of the long conversation I had  with Mickey Kantor on 30 March, we agreed to put our "foot in  the door." However, the aim is not to force our partners to join  a system which, moreover, we have not yet defined. France and  the United States want the social dimension of international  trade to be taken into account. The aim is not to curb the  expansion of the developing countries or to call into question  competition with countries with low wages, but to ensure that  our partners share concerns -- and hence objectives -- of a  social nature.    Like democracy, freedom of information and human rights are  imperatives, and there must also be a degree of respect for the  worker. With a minimum and a limit. The minimum encompasses  the International Labor Organization [ILO] and matters relating  to enforced labor or child labor. I would readily describe it  as a "humanitarian clause" without which world trade would not  be morally acceptable. The limit is that there is no question  of imposing our system of social protection on others. However,  there must be some proportion, a relationship between the level  of development and the degree of social protection.    [LE FIGARO] Why talk of this social clause now?    [Longuet] The GATT issue is based on three major  considerations: solidarity among regional groupings (and we have  succeeded in securing recognition of the European identity);  respect for the environment; and the social clause. These are  the preconditions of fair trade. Indeed, the countries which do  not respect the international standards in the sphere of the  environment should not benefit from an unfair advantage.  Conversely, the protection of the environment must not be a  pretext for adopting protectionist measures. That is why we  were demanding the permanent establishment of a committee for  the environment. We secured it.  <H5>  Conquest and Relocation </H5>   [Longuet continues] On the other hand, before 15 December,  we  did not want to call into question European solidarity by  demanding, at the time, a monetary or social clause. Today, the  United States is demanding the introduction of a social clause.  This is a chance to seize the opportunity and try to move the  European position in this direction. Here, too, our position is  gaining ground, as the compromise adopted in Geneva yesterday  shows.    With regard to the Third World countries, if we imposed  restrictions on them, they would have reason to refuse them.  But this is not the case: The social clause is the logical  complement of the commercial provisions of the GATT agreement:  The gradual dismantling of the AMF (Multifiber Agreement), the  reduction in customs duties and -- if China one day joins GATT  -- the dismantling of quota regulations.    Who will be affected by the social clause? The new  industrialized countries, of course, and the developed countries  which are considering relocation as an element of conquest.    [LE FIGARO] Is this not opening a new debate, while there  has already been some backtracking on the proposals made in  Geneva [as published] and a number of issues have not been  settled? Are the shortcomings of the GATT agreement not being  concealed?    [Longuet] Between 15 December and today, there has been some  backtracking on a small number of tariff offers.    But, generally speaking, the GATT agreement is and remains  positive: Customs duties will fall by 40 percent! That is a  wonderful prospect for world trade. In terms of sector  agreements, we knew that there were some difficult areas:  aeronautics and financial services, for instance. Even on  these two issues, negotiations are planned for after Marrakesh.    I think that making progress between 15 December 1993 and 15  April 1994 on social issues is much more important than sadly  noting that we have not received new offers of customs duty  reductions. Reaching a good agreement with the Americans on  social issues and aeronautics also strikes me as a good  investment. With regard to the AMF, I would like to be sure  that the lack of proposals to open textile markets by countries  with low wages -- Pakistan and India, for instance -- will be  well compensated for by a slower dismantling of tariffs  affecting those countries.    [LE FIGARO] To return to Marrakesh, do you think that all  the states present will sign?    [Longuet] Yes. I think that the significance of the event  must be gauged. The creation of the World Trade Organization  (WTO) marks a new era in relations among countries. After the  end of the Cold War and the military confrontation between the  blocs, the creation of the WTO bears witness to a period in  which the concerted development of human activity prevails over  ideological and territorial confrontations.    [LE FIGARO] Is there likely to be a problem of ratification  in some countries, especially in the United States?    [Longuet] I think that if Mickey Kantor, who succeeded in  securing a favorable vote in the U.S. Congress on NAFTA, is  demanding this social clause, it is because he has fully  realized that it was useful to have this clause to ensure  ratification of the GATT agreement.    [LE FIGARO] Is there not some inconsistency in welcoming the  GATT agreements, explaining that they are good for France, and  at the same time supporting the GATT entry of the new  industrialized countries (NIC), where wages are 10 or 20 times  lower? Will that not speed up the process of relocation?    [Longuet] In the sphere of development, the Asian NICs have  taken the easiest route: producing consumer goods in a  competitive way. They must now move on to the next stage: that  of infrastructure, which is costly, which requires technology  and capital, and in which we are very competitive. It will take  them 10 or 20 years to catch up.  <H5>  Toward the Western Model </H5>   [Longuet continues] During this period, we will continue to  sell them capital goods. But experience shows that these  countries will have to face a fairly rapid increase in the cost  of labor in their countries. Their ability to mobilize a cheap  labor force is not unlimited, whereas the requirements of  consumption are vast. The wage increases in Hong Kong, Chenxing,  and Singapore are already considerable. We are therefore  engaged in a race in which these countries are both our clients  and our competitors. But they will be competitors less and less  as their production costs become comparable with ours, and  clients more and more as their purchasing power increases. The  implementation of rules on forgery and intellectual property  will now contribute to moving these countries toward the Western  model.    [LE FIGARO] The problem for us is the cost of the  transition, which is measured in particular in terms of  relocation.    [Longuet] When the French consumer benefits from an increase  in his purchasing power by the reduction in the price of  products, the French producer does not benefit from a reduction  in his production costs, in view of the cost of labor which  nobody reasonably envisages reducing. The scales are tipped in  the consumer's favor, to the producer's detriment. Should we  not now seek a better balance? This is what we are doing by  including some social security contributions in the budget.  This eases the pressure on the producer and shifts it to the  taxpayer, hence to the consumer, whose purchasing power will be  reduced. If the load is shifted to sectors which are not  exposed to world competition -- I am thinking, for example, of  the distribution of gasoline by hiring pump attendants -- you  penalize the consumer a little but you benefit employment. I  think that this is now a priority.    [LE FIGARO] For years, the participants have been trying to  introduce a monetary dimension to the GATT agreements. However,  the Americans do not want that. What is most important:  stabilizing the dollar or signing GATT agreements?    [Longuet] If we could do both, it would be perfect, but the  stabilization of the dollar is largely beyond our control. We  are participating in the organization of GATT and the creation  of the WTO, and the WTO will become a factor of stability in a  world which lacks it terribly. So, what is, basically, the best  way of stabilizing the dollar? It is a European currency, which  would make it possible to offer a refuge "as good as the  dollar," as my friend Jacques Toubon would say.    [LE FIGARO] What is France's position on China joining GATT?    [Longuet] We are not hostile to it in theory. But, in view  of China's size and the problems involved, the conditions of  this membership really must be carefully defined. And China  must accept all the rules of the WTO.</p>

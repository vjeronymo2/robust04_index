			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / UK Company News: AG Barr tops Pounds 2m and pins hopes on good summer AG Barr, the Glasgow-based soft drinks company which manufactures Irn-Bru and Tizer, yesterday reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.23m for the six months to April 30 1994, compared with restated profits of Pounds 1.61m for the equivalent period of 1992-93. The restatement, from Pounds 2.1m, follows a decision to apportion marketing expenditure according to turnover levels instead of charging it when it occurs. Turnover fell 4.5 per cent to Pounds 40.1m as the company turned away business in retailers' own label brands because of the low prices on offer from the big supermarket chains. Own label brands normally make up about 10 per cent of Barr's turnover. Mr Robin Barr, executive chairman, said current pricing levels were too low to provide manufacturers with a satisfactory long-term return. Competition in own label brands was intensified by the introduction in April of Sainsbury's Classic Cola. AG Barr says its own brands, where profit margins are higher, had a 2.5 per cent sales increase in the half year. Mr Barr said turnover during the first nine weeks of the second half had followed the same pattern as that of the first. But he hoped the recent warm weather, particularly in the south of England, presaged better weather for the rest of the summer. Last year's poor summer had had a disastrous effect on sales, he said. Earnings per share emerged at 7.95p against a restated 5.91p and the interim divi-dend is being increased to 2p (1.75p). The shares closed up 7p at 346p.</p>

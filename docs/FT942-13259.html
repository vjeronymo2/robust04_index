			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: No damage to competition Sir, The Engineering Employers Federation and the European employers body, UNICE, are reported ('EU works council costs put at Pounds 1m', April 22) as opposing the EU proposals for company consultative bodies on the grounds of cost and delays of decision-making. European firms ought to consider whether the slower, more consultative decision-making reported of Japanese business has undermined its competitiveness. A quick calculation also suggests that the Pounds 1m cost of meetings forecast by the EEF, for the 30 most affected British companies, averages Pounds 33,000 per firm - roughly the cost of one executive's company car. If the profitability of British multinational firms hinges on these kinds of sums, then they surely need more monitoring of their decisions.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Surinder Oberoi] </F>   [Text] Srinagar, India, March 12 (AFP) -- Javed Mir, the  president of the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front and  most-wanted Kashmiri Moslem militant, was arrested here Saturday  [12 March], witnesses and JKLF sources said.    Mir, 30, the former commander-in-chief of the guerrilla wing  of the Moslem separatist group, was arrested along with another  man when the car in which they were travelling was stopped by  border guards, the witnesses said.    The pair were pulled out of the car and whisked away by the  Indian paramilitary troops, they said. The other man, whose  identity was not immediately known, was later released.    JKLF sources here confirmed the arrest of the JKLF president  but there was no immediate word from the Indian authorities.    The stocky and bearded Mir was one of the four founders of  the Moslem separatist rebellion which began in India's only  Moslem-majority state in 1989 and his arrest is seen as a major  setback to the movement.    Of the other three architects of the armed struggle against  Indian rule, two are dead and the third is in prison. Mir, who  worked for the state waterworks department before picking up a  gun, carried a reward of 50,000 rupees (1,666 dollars) on his  head and topped the list of Kashmiri Moslem militants wanted by  the Indian authorities.    A native of Sringar, Mir has been accused by the Indian  authorities of singlehandedly carrying out several deadly  attacks against Indian troops deployed in the northern state.    The outlawed JKLF is the second most powerful Moslem  separatist organization in Kashmir after the Hizbul Mujahedeen,  which favors a merger of the state with Pakistan.    Unlike the Hizbul and most other groups, the JKLF seeks  independence for the Himalayan territory.    Mir is the third top leader of the JKLF to be arrested in  the  past fortnight and his arrest comes just a day after he made a  surprise appearance at the main mosque in Srinagar to deliver a  speech from the pulpit.    Last week, Mir was among a group of Kashmiri Moslem leaders  who met here with a team of 10 New Delhi-based diplomats who  toured the strife-torn state.    More than 8,000 people have died in Moslem-separatist  related  violence in Kashmir since 1989.    India, which holds the southern two-thirds of Kashmir,  accuses Pakistan, which controls the northern third, of arming  and training the militants waging the fight against India rule.    Pakistan denies the charge but provides diplomatic support  to  a campaign which it describes as a legitimate struggle for  self-determination.</p>

			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / Peseta remains vulnerable to further attacks A BELIEF in the international money markets that Spain's foreign exchange reserves have been drastically depleted is likely to prompt fresh attacks on the peseta, now the weakest currency inside the European exchange rate mechanism. The reserves are understood by traders to have fallen as low as Dollars 20bn, well down on the Dollars 50.4bn recorded at the end of the 1992 and below the Dollars 30bn level considered by the Finance Ministry to be the minimum amount needed to defend the peseta. In addition to forcing up interbank rates the Bank of Spain is thought to have spent around Dollars 10bn of its reserves in the past few days to avert a devaluation. Last Friday, the peseta dropped to an historic low in the ERM of Pta74.00 against the DM. Mr Carlos Solchaga, finance minister, pledged at the weekend to keep the peseta within the mechanism. 'Our friends and allies in the EMS . . . are convinced that exchange rate stability is good for the peseta and for the EMS and that the actual level (of the peseta) is realistic,' Mr Solchaga said. But the Bank of Spain, which earlier this year intervened when the peseta weakened to Pta72 against the D-Mark, now appears under pressure from the markets to accept a rate below the peseta's central parity. Analysts say the peseta could be pushed further down on its 6 per cent ERM band to Pta75-76 to the D-Mark, just off its Pta77 floor. The attacks on the currency are being fuelled by Spain's recession and by predictions of political uncertainty after general elections on June 6. An opinion poll published yesterday by Barcelona's La Vanguardia newspaper put the centre right Partido Popular party marginally ahead of the ruling socialists but well short of gaining a governing majority.</p>

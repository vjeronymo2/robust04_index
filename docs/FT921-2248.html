			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Bids in for Athens phones NINE international consortia have submitted bids to set up two mobile phone networks in Greece to serve Athens and the surrounding Attica district. The bidders include groups led by Bell South and Telefonica International of Spain; Vodafone of the UK and Intracom, a Greek telecoms company; and Motorola with Bell Canada and France Telecom. The Greek government said that contracts will be awarded later this year, with the two systems expected to start up before the end of 1993. Investment in the project will reach Dollars 200m (Pounds 113.6m) in the first five years, with initial studies indicating about 80,000 subscribers by 1996. Both networks will use GSM, the new cellular radio system now being set up across Europe. The mobile networks are intended to relieve pressure on the conventional system. Applicants for telephones have to wait an average of seven years for a connection. However, the project is already several months behind schedule because of delays in setting up a regulatory framework for Greek telecommunications. In addition, the government has not yet decided whether OTE, the Greek state telecoms company, can take a minority stake in both mobile networks without violating EC rules.</p>

			<p><P> June 29, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUNTY STUDIES ALTERNATIVES FOR WASTE DISPOSAL  </P> <P> The county Sanitation Districts are studying 10 proposals from major waste  haulers, railroads and entrepreneurs offering to take trash from Los Angeles  County to the desert by train to be recycled, buried or burned.  </P> <P> One company proposes to load 7,000 tons of trash a day on trains in City of  Industry, Irwindale and La Verne and haul the waste 185 miles to an abandoned  iron ore pit in Riverside County.  </P> <P> Another company would build a waste separation and recycling plant at Puente  Hills landfill near Hacienda Heights and ship trash by rail to a plant near  Victorville for processing into construction materials.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Trash Exportation  </P> <P> And a third company proposes to accept the rail-shipment of all the waste  generated every day in Los Angeles County -- 45,000 tons -- at a dump in Kern  County.  </P> <P> The proposals were submitted to the county Sanitation Districts in response to  a request for proposals for the design, financing and development of systems to  export trash from Los Angeles County to remote areas.  </P> <P> The districts issued the request for proposals at the urging of the San Gabriel  Valley Assn. of Cities, which began looking into the feasibility of rail-haul  in 1986 as an alternative to trash-burning plants proposed in Irwindale, Puente  Hills and Pomona. Environmental opposition killed the trash-burning projects,  but cities have continued to pursue the rail-haul alternative.  </P> <P> A study undertaken by the Southern California Assn. of Governments last year  found that hauling trash from the San Gabriel Valley to remote disposal sites  by rail is "technically feasible and offers a potential solution to the solid  waste disposal crisis projected for the 1990s."  </P> <P> The report by the regional planning agency noted that landfills in Los Angeles  County are nearing capacity and that recycling is only a partial solution.  </P> <P> Currently, 58% of the county's trash goes to landfills in the San Gabriel  Valley and nearby Glendale.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Closed by Noon  </P> <P> The county's largest landfill, Puente Hills, is so busy that it is often closed  to trash trucks by noon because it has reached its daily permitted limit of  13,200 tons. Other landfills also are operating at capacity and county  officials have predicted that by 1992, the amount of trash being generated may  exceed the available landfill space by 6,000 tons a day.  </P> <P> The Sanitation Districts are exploring six potential landfill sites in Los  Angeles County, but there are numerous obstacles, such as opposition from  neighbors and stringent environmental regulations, which could delay or kill  the projects. Thus, the Sanitation Districts have begun looking into the  feasibility of shipping trash out of the county.  </P> <P> Charles W. Carry, chief engineer and general manager of the Sanitation  Districts, said the rail-haul proposals received from private companies ranged  from letters a few pages long to books thick with technical detail. Some of the  proposals, he said, "are well thought out and rather complete. Others are  little more than an expression of interest."  </P> <P> His staff was scheduled to evaluate the proposals and was to have reported its  initial findings to the waste management task force of the San Gabriel Valley  Assn. of Cities on Tuesday.  </P> <P> Thomas Harvey, task force chairman, said he has not seen the proposals, but the  fact that they have come from railroads and major firms in the waste disposal  industry is encouraging.  </P> <P> "I was pleased with the extent of interest shown," Harvey said.  </P> <P> What remains to be seen, he said, is whether trash can be sent to the desert  for disposal at prices that are competitive with other options and whether such  difficult problems as finding acceptable sites for loading the trains can be  solved.  </P> <P> Some of the difficulties are already apparent.  </P> <P> Mine Reclamation Corp. has proposed building waste-loading stations in La  Verne, Irwindale and Industry and hauling 7,000 tons of trash a day by rail to  a disposal site at Eagle Mountain in Riverside County. Gary Kovall, senior vice  president and general counsel of Mine Reclamation, said the company notified La  Verne, Irwindale and Industry of proposed train-loading locations and, he said,  "I would not describe their reaction as one of open arms."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Irwindale 'Negative'  </P> <P> "Industry was the most open," Kovall said. "Irwindale was negative and La Verne  was like, 'You've got to be kidding.' "  </P> <P> Two of the proposed sites, along Southern Pacific railroad lines in Industry  and Irwindale, were suggested in the study by the Southern California Assn. of  Governments. The third site, across from Brackett Field in La Verne, was found  independently by Mine Reclamation Corp. But Harvey, a member of the La Verne  City Council, said that the site appears to conflict with plans to develop a  103-acre research and development complex.  </P> <P> Kovall stressed that Mine Reclamation Corp. is not wedded to any particular  loading site.  </P> <P> "We haved mentioned our interest in having about 10 acres in those areas (of  Industry, Irwindale and La Verne)," he said. "But that is very preliminary. We  have not made any steps to acquire real estate or anything like that."  </P> <P> In fact, Kovall said, the better approach may well be to use existing  landfills, such as Spadra in Pomona or Puente Hills, as sites to receive trash,  separate glass, plastics, metals and other materials for recycling and then  compact and load the remaining waste into 20-foot long containers that could be  trucked to a rail line and loaded onto rail cars.  </P> <P> Kovall said his company is willing to explore a wide range of options with the  Sanitation Districts or the cities that would be served.  </P> <P> Robert H. Collins III, president and chief executive officer of Mine  Reclamation, said the location of train-loading stations will be based "on  which municipalities want to go ahead and rail-haul to Eagle Mountain. There's  no point in having a transfer station in the east end of the San Gabriel Valley  if you're going to be moving waste from the west end or the north end."  </P> <P> Mine Reclamation's chief asset is its 100-year lease on 8,000 acres at the  Eagle Mountain mine, near Desert Center.  </P> <P> The mine was opened in 1948 to supply iron ore to the Kaiser steel mill in  Fontana and was closed in 1982.  </P> <P> Collins said the mine's east pit is large enough to receive 16,000 tons of  trash a day for 100 years. Kaiser Steel Resources Inc., which owns the mine,  would receive a portion of the trash disposal fee under its lease arrangement  with Mine Reclamation. Mine Reclamation is a privately held corporation whose  owners include Herzog Contracting Corp., a San Diego landfill management firm;  EDCO Disposal, a waste collection company based in Lemon Grove in San Diego  County, and Itel Corp., a Chicago firm that leases railroad cars and other  transportation equipment.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Riverside Plan  </P> <P> The Riverside County Board of Supervisors has instructed its staff to negotiate  an agreement with Mine Reclamation that would give the county a fee for  allowing the importation of trash to Eagle Mountain. County officials said  their approval of the project will depend on whether the landfill operation and  rail-haul can be accomplished with environmental safety and whether it will  benefit the area economically.  </P> <P> Mine Reclamation earlier this month filed an application with Riverside County  for a land-use permit, specific plan and zone changes at Eagle Mountain. The  project will require environmental impact studies and permits from various  governmental agencies. Company officials said the landfill could be in  operation by 1992.  </P> <P> Some of the proposals submitted to the Sanitation Districts did not specify  where trash trains would be loaded, but at least three of the proposals would  serve the San Gabriel Valley.  </P> <P> International Technology Corp. of Torrance and the Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa  Fe Railway Co. proposed a system that would handle 6,000 tons of trash a day.  The plan calls for processing waste at landfills at Puente Hills, Spadra,  Calabasas and Scholl Canyon in Glendale, to remove materials that can be  recycled. The remainder would then be put in containers to be hauled by truck  to the City of Commerce and then by train to Adelanto and Needles in San  Bernardino County. Plants in those desert communities would turn the refuse  into fuel for factories or use it to generate electrical power.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Re-Use of Waste  </P> <P> Western Product Recovery Group, Inc. of Escondido and the Union Pacific Corp.  proposed a plan for 3,500 tons of trash a day at Puente Hills landfill. A  processing plant would be built at Puente Hills to separate materials for  recycling and to process refuse into fuel. Some refuse would be shipped by  truck to the City of Commerce for transfer to trains bound for the Victorville  area, where a plant would be established to produce construction materials.  </P> <P> Grace Chan, supervisor of solid waste planning with the Sanitation Districts,  said a number of companies submitted proposals without specifying where trash  would be loaded onto trains. Other companies, she said, asked that potential  loading sites, proposed disposal rates and other information be kept  confidential.  </P> <P> Western Waste Industries Inc. of Gardena proposed a system to handle 12,000  tons of trash a day at a rate of $65 to $75 a ton, but asked that loading  stations and disposal sites remain confidential. Browning-Ferris Industries of  California Inc. did not specify loading stations or disposal sites, but  estimated that it could develop a system that could handle 16,000 tons of trash  a day at a rate of $60 to $90 a ton.  </P> <P> Sage Resources of Los Angeles and the United States Borax and Chemical Corp.  offered disposal sites in Kern County, but did not submit plans for hauling the  trash there. Earth Technology Corp. of Long Beach proposed a Kern County  disposal site that could handle 45,000 tons of trash a day.  </P> <P> Waste Management of North America, Inc. and the Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe  Railway Co. proposed a system to take 6,000 tons of trash a day from the City  of Commerce and El Segundo to a landfill at Amboy in San Bernardino County.  </P> <P> Railex Special Projects Group of Vancouver, British Columbia, proposed the  rail-haul of up to 13,000 tons of trash a day from unspecified locations to  various refuse-to-energy plants in Barstow and other San Bernardino County  communities. The firm said the cost would be $28 a ton.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Give Me Your Trash'  </P> <P> Carry, the Sanitation Districts' general manager, said the $28-per-ton figure  is unrealistically low.  </P> <P> Disposal rates at landfills in Los Angeles County currently range from $10 to  $25 a ton. The rail-haul study by the Southern California Assn. of Governments  last year estimated that trash could be shipped from the San Gabriel Valley and  disposed of in remote sites for $29 to $41 a ton.  </P> <P> Mine Reclamation declined to disclose its proposed disposal rate, but Kovall,  its general counsel, said the amount is under $50 a ton.  </P> <P> One of the difficulties in creating a rail-haul system is overcoming the  competitive disadvantage of comparatively cheap disposal rates at local  landfills.  </P> <P> "We can't put up a big sign that says, 'Give me your trash for $50 a ton,'  while Puente Hills is charging $14," Kovall said. "The trucks are not going to  pull in."  </P> <P> Kovall said it undoubtedly will cost more to haul trash to the desert than to a  local landfill, but there are environmental benefits to be obtained from  rail-haul, including reduced truck traffic, if train-loading stations are  properly located.  </P> <P> Officials of the Sanitation Districts said they will interview the companies  that have submitted rail-haul proposals and then submit evaluations to district  directors and the San Gabriel Valley Assn. of Cities. Then, officials said,  they may take the most promising proposals and ask companies to develop them in  further detail.  </P> <P> </P> <P> SOME OF THE PROPOSALS  </P> <P> Mine Reclamation Corp. has proposed building waste-loading stations in La  Verne, Irwindale and Industry and hauling 7,000 tons of trash a day by rail to  a disposal site at Eagle Mountain in Riverside County.  </P> <P> International Technology Corp. of Torrance and the Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa  Fe Railway Co. proposed a system that would handle 6,000 tons of trash a day.

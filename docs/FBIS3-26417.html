For decades, the U.S. Navy has operated fleet of specially  equipped submarines whose secret work is to comb deep waters for  military intelligence virtually unobtainable by any other means,  THE NEW YORK TIMES said today.    These spy submarines, as experts in naval warfare said, are  the Navy's counterpart to reconnaissance satellites, but better  in some respects.    They said such submarines can not only examine distant  objects on the ocean floor, but also in some cases retrieve or  manipulate them.    The objects of interest include lost ships, submarines,  planes, weapons, rockets, spacecraft and nuclear warheads, as  well as functioning equipment, like other countries' undersea  cables and devices, THE TIMES reported.    "A vivid example of the spying technique was recently given  to Congress by a former senior Navy official who disclosed an  early mission of one of these submarines, the Halibut, to  examine a sunken Soviet submarine in the Pacific in 1968," the  newspaper noted.    The naval experts, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said  the Halibut was the first in a series of these submarines, which  actually constitute a new class of American submarine designed  to lower gear-laden cables for deep reconnaissance, recovery and  manipulation.</p>

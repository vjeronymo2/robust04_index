			<p><P> March 13, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> NOT FIRING GREENSPAN, BUSH SAYS  </P> <P> President Bush acknowledged a traditional conflict between his office and the  Federal Reserve Board today but denied a report that he did not plan to  reappoint Alan Greenspan as the board's chairman.  </P> <P> "There is no discussion of that nature at all," Bush told a news conference  when asked about a report in the Los Angeles Times last week that he would not  reappoint Greenspan due to the chairman's refusal to lower interest rates.  </P> <P> Greenspan's four-year term expires next year.  </P> <P> Bush said, "Now, the question: Am I happy with interest rates? Look, every  President would like to see interest rates lower.  </P> <P> "I don't knock the concern some have over inflation. . . . But there's no  bubbling war with Alan Greenspan."  </P></p>

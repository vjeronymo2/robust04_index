			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / Business Travel: BA ticket scam British Airways is to tighten up ticketing procedures after a reservations clerk allegedly worked a scam which gave him Pounds 160,000 worth of free trips. The clerk allegedly made fake reservations on BA's Concorde booking computer which enabled him and a friend to qualify for the airline's frequent- flyer, free-travel incentive scheme, Air Miles. The tickets were not paid for or collected and were in a false name. After the flights took off, the clerk allegedly changed details on the reservations computer so it showed the pair had been aboard.</p>

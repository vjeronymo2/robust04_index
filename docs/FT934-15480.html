			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / World Trade News: Japan finds car market hub - Thailand's demand is growing fast 25m baht (Pounds 655,000),' says Mr Takuma Sato, president of Toyota Motor Thailand, during an interview at his office near Bangkok. His public relations manager hurriedly intervenes to explain that the Dollars 1m donation to Mr Chuan Leekpai's government is for worthy projects to alleviate Bangkok's notorious traffic congestion, including the purchase of a helicopter and funding for research. Mr Sato's casual remark, however, helps to illustrate the importance Japanese motor manufacturers attach to Thailand: as a developing market in which they account for 93 per cent of vehicle sales, and as a potential automotive industry hub. Toyota has a 25 per cent share of vehicle sales in Thailand, and its biggest operation in south-east Asia: reducing traffic jams - Toyota is sponsoring a second symposium on the problem in November - is good for business. Three years ago, Thailand was Toyota's seventh largest foreign market and last year its fourth; this year it will be third or second. With the economy expanding at about 7 per cent a year, Thailand's middle class is growing fast. Last year vehicle sales rose by 35 per cent to 362,987 units; between January and August this year they rose a further 36 per cent over the same period in 1992. Toyota predicts total industry sales of 440,000 to 450,000 in 1993, followed by more modest growth to bring the figure above 600,000 by the turn of the century. Japanese corporations are not the only beneficiaries. Although nearly half of the vehicles sold in Thailand are still one-tonne Japanese pickups (dubbed 'the national car' and often adapted for passengers as well as freight), the luxury car market, dominated by European manufacturers, has also expanded rapidly, especially since tariff barriers against the import of complete vehicles and kits were eased in 1991. A total of 8,459 Mercedes Benz cars were sold in the first eight months of this year, more than double the number at the same time in 1992. Suppliers to the industry have done well, too. The Thai affiliate of Bridgestone, the Japanese tyre company, is planning to build a second factory and treble production capacity to 30,000 tyres a day. Burmah Castrol of the UK, known for its lubricants, says Castrol Thailand already ranks in the top 10 Castrol companies worldwide and could soon become more profitable than Castrol UK. Chrysler and GM of the US are both considering establishing assembly operations in Thailand. Toyota has earmarked Bt14.3bn for expansion in Thailand, and Mitsubishi and Isuzu also have plans to invest hundreds of millions of dollars. 'All (Japanese) manufacturers are now considering expansion in this country,' says Mr Sato. The idea is not merely to take advantage of the Thai market. Japanese vehicle and component manufacturers also want to achieve economies of scale in their regional and global production. Thailand's modestly-priced workforce, relatively sophisticated industrial base and large collection of Japanese or Japanese-affiliated component makers all fit that description. The recent rise of the yen has further encouraged Japanese companies to shift production to Asia. 'In 1993, the Thai auto industry remains a predominantly domestic industry,' says a report published this year by Thailand's Board of Investment. 'But current political reforms and massive Japanese inward investment portend changes.' Toyota has made a start. A joint venture with the Siam Cement conglomerate produces diesel engines for one-tonne pickups which are exported to countries within the six-nation Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean), as well as to New Zealand and Portugal. Toyota Corolla body parts are stamped in Thailand and exported to the Philippines. In all, Thai automotive component exports grew to Dollars 350m (Pounds 231.7m) in 1992 from Dollars 63m in 1987. But the protectionist policies of individual Asean countries are making it hard for Toyota and its rivals to produce parts in such volumes that they are cheaper than those made in Japan. Mr Sato, however, believes that Thailand and other Asean countries will eventually export substantial numbers of cars and parts to each other, to Indochina, and even to Japan itself. 'In the 21st century,' he said, 'maybe Asean will be the biggest (vehicle) market in the world, bigger than the USA.'</p>

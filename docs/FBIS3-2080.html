Zhang Sai, director of the State Statistics Bureau, said  today that China adopted a secure monetary policy to curtail the  undue fixed assets investment and excessive money supply, absorb  savings deposits, increase the input and adjust the structure of  credit and loans.    These measures guaranteed the supply of capital for state  key  projects, in industrial and agricultural production, in  purchasing farm and sideline products and in alleviating the  shortage of circulating capital encountered by some important  enterprises, he added.    At the end of 1993, he said, savings in various forms in  state banks totalled 2,324.5 billion yuan, an increase of 433.9  billion yuan or 23 percent more than the total a year before.  The money in circulation amounted to 586.5 billion yuan, up  35.3 percent, and the money supply in 1993 was 152.9 billion  yuan.    At the same time, China's foreign exchange reserve  increased,  standing at 21.2 billion U.S. dollars in cash (savings deposits  in foreign exchange at the Bank of China excluded), 1.76 billion  more than at the beginning of that year, statistics showed.    Zhang said China's insurance service also made big strides  in  1993. Property insurance of various kinds totalled 5,137  billion yuan, up 12.6 percent over 1992. Over 776,000  enterprises joined in enterprise property insurance, 130 million  households participated in household property insurance and 250  million persons in life insurance programs.    He said that insurance companies tackled nearly 7 million  claims of property loss and paid an indemnity of 13.7 billion  yuan for settled cases. Another 9.1 billion yuan was paid to  6.64 million persons as reparations in life insurance programs.</p>

			<p><P> November 7, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COUNTY ELECTIONS;  </P> <P> SUPERVISORS;  </P> <P> WIEDER BUILDING LEAD, JUST AS SHE EXPECTED  </P> <P> Orange County Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder maintained an early lead over  challenger Joy L. Neugebauer early today in her bid for a fourth consecutive  term in office, according to partial ballot results.  </P> <P> Wieder, who said she spent Tuesday afternoon walking along the oceanfront,  enjoying the beach and "indulging" herself after voting, took the lead early in  the evening Tuesday and built on it as the precincts began reporting in shortly  before midnight.  </P> <P> She said her lead in the election "was something I expected."  </P> <P> "I have credibility with the voters," said Wieder, who spent part of the  evening at the Westin South Coast Plaza hotel with supporters.  </P> <P> "I believe the voters have a great deal of confidence in me. . . . I am a  representative, not a politician," she added.  </P> <P> Despite Wieder's lead, Neugebauer said she "ran the race to win" and declined  to concede defeat shortly after midnight.  </P> <P> "There's a lot of votes to come in yet and I'm still optimistic," Neugebauer  said.  </P> <P> Wieder was forced into a runoff for her fourth term representing the 2nd  District when she finished with 47% of the vote in June, far ahead of  Neugebauer, who had 20%, and three other challengers.  </P> <P> The supervisor's job carries an annual salary of $82,055. It is a four-year  term.  </P> <P> Wieder hired a new political consultant for the campaign and pumped out  issue-oriented mail pieces targeted at different voting groups within the  district, focusing on her achievements during the past 12 years as the first  and only woman on the Orange County Board of Supervisors.  </P> <P> Early on, it was clear that Wieder would surpass the challenger in raising  money. According to the most recent campaign disclosure statements, Wieder had  raised more than 10 times as much money as Neugebauer, amassing a war chest of  $259,952 to the challenger's $25,055.  </P> <P> By contrast, Neugebauer borrowed on her homespun, low-key political style that  has made her a fixture on the Westminster City Council, where she has served  for 18 years.  </P> <P> In the primary, Neugebauer raised only $12,000 while Wieder spent more than  $80,000. Neugebauer said she knew that it would be an uphill climb, but  low-budget campaigns have been her trademark and she said being outspent did  not scare her because she "has always" relied on volunteers to get the word of  her campaign to the voters.  </P> <P> Tuesday night Neugebauer said there was no problem with her campaign's  fund-raising efforts because she wanted "a low-budget campaign."  </P> <P> A few days before the election, Neugebauer said she "was optimistic," and that  she did "not intend to win this election on developer dollars. I will win it on  my qualifications and grass-roots support."  </P> <P> The election was in sharp contrast to Wieder campaigns of years past, where  personally embarrassing information was disclosed, such as in 1988 when her  opponent revealed that the supervisor had claimed a college degree from Wayne  State University that she never earned.  </P> <P> Neugebauer did use the college-degree disclosure in campaign speeches as part  of her political strategy to list "Harriett's negatives," including the fact  that Wieder had missed more meetings and abstained from more votes than any of  her board colleagues.  </P> <P> Times staff writer George Frank contributed to this article.  </P></p>

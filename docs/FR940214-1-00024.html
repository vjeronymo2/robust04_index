			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (4) As an alternative to legal action in the judicial system of the country with regard to claims against a public entity of the government of the cooperating country, the Cooperating Sponsor and the cooperating country may agree in writing to settle disputed claims by an appropriate administrative procedure or arbitration. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Determination of value. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  When payment is to be made for commodities misused, lost or damaged, the value shall be determined on the basis of the domestic market price at the time and place the misuse, loss or damage occurred. When it is not feasible to determine such market price, the value shall be the f.o.b. or f.a.s. commercial export price of the commodity at the time and place of export, plus ocean freight charges and other costs incurred by the U.S. Government in making delivery to the Cooperating Sponsor. When the value is determined on a cost basis, the Cooperating Sponsor may add to the value any provable costs it has incurred prior to delivery by the ocean carrier. In preparing the claim statement, these costs shall be clearly segregated from costs incurred by the Government of the United States. With respect to claims other than ocean carrier loss or damage claims, the value of misused, lost or damaged commodities may be determined on some other justifiable basis, at the request of the Cooperating Sponsor or upon the recommendation of the Agricultural Counselor or Attache or CCC designated representative. When replacement is made, the value of commodities misused, lost or damaged shall be their value at the time and place the misuse, loss, or damage occurred and the value of the replacement commodities shall be their value at the time and place replacement is made. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Reporting losses to the Agricultural Counselor or Attache or CCC designated representative. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (1) The Cooperating Sponsor shall promptly notify the Agricultural Counselor or Attache or CCC designated representative, in writing, of the circumstances pertaining to any loss, damage, or misuse of commodities valued at $500 or more occurring within the country of distribution or intermediate country. The report shall be made as soon as the Cooperating Sponsor has adequately investigated the circumstances, but in no event more than ninety (90) days from the date the loss became known to the Cooperating Sponsor. The report shall identify the party in possession of the commodities and the party responsible for the loss, damage or misuse; the kind and quantities of commodities; the size and type of containers; the time and place of misuse, loss, or damage; the current location of the commodity; the Program Agreement number, the CCC contract numbers, or if unknown, other identifying numbers printed on the commodity containers; the action taken by the Cooperating Sponsor with respect to recovery or disposal; and the estimated value of the commodity. The Cooperating Sponsor shall explain the unavailability of any of the above information. The Cooperating Sponsor shall also report the details regarding any loss or misuse of monetized proceeds or program income. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The Cooperating Sponsor shall report quarterly to the Agricultural Counselor or Attache any loss, damage to or misuse of commodities resulting in loss of less than $500. The Cooperating Sponsor shall inform the Agricultural Counselor or Attache or CCC designated representative if it has reason to believe there is a pattern or trend in the loss, damage, or misuse of such commodities and submit a report on the basis described in paragraph (h)(1) of this section together with such other information as the Cooperating Sponsor has available to it. The Agricultural Counselor or Attache may require additional information about any commodities lost, damaged or misused if it believes such information is necessary in order to maintain the integrity of the program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Handling claims proceeds. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Claims against ocean carriers shall be collected in U.S. dollars (or in currency in which freight is paid, or a pro data share of either) and shall be remitted (less amounts authorized to be retained) by Cooperation Sponsors to CCC. Claims against Cooperating Sponsors shall be paid to CCC in U.S. dollars. With respect to commodities lost, damaged or misused, amounts paid by Cooperating Sponsors and third parties in the country of distribution shall be deposited with the U.S. Disbursing Officer, American Embassy, preferably, in U.S. dollars with instructions to credit the deposit to an appropriate CCC account as determined by CCC, or in local currency at the official exchange rate applicable to dollar imports at the time of deposit with instructions to credit the deposit to an appropriate CCC account as determined by CCC. With respect to monetized proceeds and program income, amounts recovered may be deposited in the same account as the monetized proceeds and may be used for purposes of the program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;1499.18  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Records and reporting requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Records and reports_general requirements. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (1) The Cooperating Sponsor shall maintain records and documents in a manner which accurately reflects all transactions pertaining to the receipt, storage, distribution sale, inspection and use of commodities and the receipt and disbursement of any monetized proceeds and program income, including interest and fees.

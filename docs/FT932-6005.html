			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / Barristers urge extension of fixed fees in legal-aid cases THE BAR HAS proposed that the system of paying barristers fixed fees for criminal legal-aid cases in Crown Courts should be extended in order to cut administrative costs and speed payments. This proposal from the barristers' body could undermine the legal profession's campaign against plans to introduce standard fees for criminal legal-aid work in magistrates' courts. The Law Society, the solicitors' body, has - with the support of the Bar - applied for a judicial review the decision to introduce such fees. In a submission to the Lord Chancellor's department the Bar proposes that barristers in criminal cases lasting up to 10 days be paid a base fee of Pounds 250, plus a daily fee of Pounds 160. The base fee would be adjusted to reflect the seriousness of the offence, the number of defendants represented, the length of the trial and whether the barrister was a QC. Standard fees for criminal legal-aid work in the Crown Courts were introduced in the early 1980s and apply to about 85 per cent of such work. The Bar believes its support for standard fees in the Crown Court does not undermine efforts to stop Lord Mackay introducing standard fees in magistrates' courts. The magistrates' court scheme involves a standard case fee irrespective of the work done on it by lawyers, whereas the Bar's proposals for the Crown Court allow variations in fees for each case. The Law Society argues that Lord Mackay's magistrates' court proposals will result in overpaying lawyers in some cases and underpaying them in others, and could lead to some lawyers cutting corners. Meanwhile the introduction of formalised plea bargaining in England and Wales is opposed by Justice, the all-party law reform pressure group, in a report published today. Plea bargaining, where defendants agree to plead guilty in exchange for a lesser sentence, is expected to be recommended by the royal commission on criminal justice which is due to report next month. The government and prosecution authorities see it as the best means of improving the efficiency of the criminal justice system. Lord Mackay, the Lord Chancellor, and Mrs Barbara Mills QC, director of public prosecutions, believe that encouraging defendants to plead guilty at an early stage could reduce the number of 'cracked trials' - trials which are aborted when the defendant changes his plea to guilty at the last minute. Mr George Staple, director of the Serious Fraud Office, sees plea bargaining as the best solution to long fraud cases. Judges and barristers are also overwhelmingly in favour. Justice says, however, that poor administrative case management and the absence of effective pre-trial procedures is the main cause of cracked trials. 'Administrative problems need administrative and management solutions rather than changes in the substantive law,' it says. Although it is already accepted that guilty pleas generally lead to reductions in sentences, Justice is concerned that formalised plea bargaining could result in some innocent people pleading guilty. 'It could rapidly lead to a system which becomes accustomed to looking for guilt and which penalises those who opt for jury trial,' the report says. It could also lead to inaccurate and unfair sentences as judges would be asked to give indications of sentence without having all the facts. Justice calls for better liaison between prosecution and defence and effective pre-trial reviews, earlier withdrawal of weak cases by the Crown Prosecution Service, a more open system of sentence discounts, guidelines for cases in which discounts are appropriate and a sentencing commission to ensure consistency.</p>

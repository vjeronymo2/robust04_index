			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Pavel Felgengauer report in the "Transcaucasus" column: </F> "The Cease-Fire in Karabakh Is in Question"]    [Text] On Friday, 18 February, in Moscow military  delegations of Armenia and Azerbaijan with the mediation of  Russian Defense Minister General Grachev and the participation  of a representative from Nagorno-Karabakh, and after seven hours  of negotiations signed a cease-fire agreement. Yesterday,  however, a "source close to the Foreign Affairs Ministry of the  Nagorno-Karabakh Republic [NKR]" contacted SEGODNYA to say that  "the NKR Foreign Ministry learned about the Moscow agreement  from the papers."    "NKR representative Bako Saakyan," who took part in the  negotiations at the Russian Federation Defense Ministry on 18  February, indeed is an officer of the NKR Defense Ministry but,  according to Stepanakert, "he is in Moscow for medical treatment  and has no official powers from NKR official bodies to act as a  representative of Nagorno-Karabakh or sign anything on behalf of  the NKR government."    Therefore, from the viewpoint of the NKR leadership, the  agreement signed in Moscow has no binding legal force. This, as  far as can be understood, does not mean that the NKR Defense  Army is going to breach the relative cease-fire that has  developed de facto in the last few days (from the lessening of  hostilities to separate shoot-outs) on the Karabakh fronts. The  NKR leadership has not planned any major offensive operations  because the positions currently held by Armenian detachments  generally suit Stepanakert. As for the terms of the three-stage  plan, "On the Cease-fire in Nagorno-Karabakh and on the Border  Between Armenia and Azerbaijan," proposed by Russia and  partially coordinated last week in Moscow, they obviously do not  please Stepanakert.</p>

			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Survey of Software at Work (48): New aid towards healthier cattle - Agricultural application: An easy-to-use relational database helps in the control of farm animal diseases IRELAND'S Department of Agriculture and Food aims to reduce all cattle diseases, especially tuberculosis. This brings about a complex systems requirement: all Irish cattle have to be granted a movement permit, and therefore have to be identifiable. The testing system for animal disease did not cater for the new Animal Movement Permit Headage, so the department decided to look for a relational database to write the application from scratch. Government procurement policies meant that the department had to find an 'open systems' solution, which also had to be compliant with the standard query language, SQL. Another consideration was the department's multi-platform hardware policy: Cincom's Supra's ability to run in IBM, UNIX and PC environments gave it an advantage over IBM's DB/2 database. Software AG's Adabas also satisfied the criteria, but the department tested both Supra and Adabas with a prototype application, using a subset of real data. 'The Supra application won on ease-of-use and flexibility,' reports John McCarthy, information technology manager,'but we were also happy with the performance.' Cincom won the IRPounds 350,000 contract, which included consultancy, implementation and training - 'they provided an easy, fairly trouble-free upgrade,' says McCarthy. About 250 users have interactive access to the database, interrogating it directly for ad hoc reports, which is why ease of use was another factor in the choice. The business benefits, says John McCarthy, are not yet visible, but he is confident that the system will lead to a better control and eventually reduction of agricultural diseases - 'also, when it comes to the renegotiation of the CAP (Common Agricultural Policy), having a database of clients means we will be able to respond to any changes of direction for agriculture. 'Having a database also means we'll be able to react swiftly, and we'll be a lot happier than we would have been three or four years ago,' he adds.</p>

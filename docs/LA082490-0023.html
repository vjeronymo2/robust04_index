			<p><P> August 24, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEWS;  </P> <P> ARMATRADING CONDUCTS HER FAMILIAR RITUAL  </P> <P> Sneak into the Wiltern Theatre today and you may still be able to see Joan  Armatrading's smile hanging Cheshire Cat-like, left over from her concert on  Wednesday. Her grin is one of the brightest around, an infectious display of  pearly whites that opens up at the slightest show of affection from her fans.  </P> <P> And Wednesday -- as usual -- the affection for her poured forth freely. Her  cult following, built through an 18-year recording career, is among the most  loyal and appreciative in pop, even if it hasn't expanded. That underscored the  pluses and minuses of this show. On the up side, Armatrading treated her fans  to a greatest-hits selection of quality material. On the down side, it was  pretty much the same concert experience she has been offering for the last  decade.  </P> <P> Such thematic touchstones as "I'm Lucky," "Love and Affection" and the standard  show-closer "Willow" are indispensable, but they've become predictable and  ritualistic parts of the show. Songs from her fine new "Hearts and Flowers"  album were relegated to secondary status in the two-hour-plus set. And most of  the older numbers were played by her five-piece band in soul-reggae-folk-rock  arrangements hardly varying from the original recordings.  </P> <P> What could Armatrading do? First of all, play more electric guitar. The few  times she strapped on her Stratocaster the music really came alive, especially  for the rocking encore one-two of "Me Myself I" and "Ma-Me-O Beach." But more  to the point, she has got the kind of audience that will follow her anywhere;  she should take more advantage of that opportunity. STEVE HOCHMAN  </P></p>

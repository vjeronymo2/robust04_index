			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / Arts: Izzard, wizard at the game There is an interesting new version of that 'Popular panel game, Just a Minute' on offer at the Albery over the next seven weeks. There is only one contestant, Eddie Izzard, who is given the usual random subjects like 'washing powders', or 'birds', or 'round tea bags' and must then witter on about them with as much repetition, hesitancy and deviation as possible until a silence falls upon the theatre. Eddie is a wizard at the game. He keeps it up for over two hours. Of course there is the odd dramatic mannerism to help things along. Izzard is a semi-detached transvestite which on this showing means wearing thick make up, including elongated red finger nails Joanna Lumley would kill for, and black tights. He also has an agreeable personality, laid back, easy going, quite at odds with the 'fingers in your eyeballs' delivery of other contemporary stand ups like Ben Elton. If you have got to be stuck between London and Edinburgh with an obsessional conversationalist you could do worse than Izzard. But charm is best oiled with good material and Izzard's is patchy. This does not worry him. If a particular imaginative flurry does not attract a giggle he says 'right enough' and crosses it out on his imaginary script. Fortunately as 'Top Live Stand Up Comedian British Comedy Awards 1993' Izzard has a reverential following and most of his musings constantly keep enough of the audience in stitches. I laughed fitfully. He is funny on the differences between dogs and cats - do not expect to tramp the realms of the higher philosophy with Izzard - and few men could talk for 20 minutes about washing powders with such surrealistic effect. His ruminations about how blue pants manage to infiltrate the white wash might make a compilation of the best of 1990s humour some day. But unless you are as caught up in the minutiae of Star Trek, leave 20 minutes before the end. You only have to say 'beam me up, Scottie' to crease up a substantial section of the population, but this is a generational weakness, a desire by thirtysomethings to return to their childhood and laugh at the awfulness of a series they took so seriously. It is too soft a target for so much of Izzard's time. Better by far are his forays into wildlife. 'Bees making honey is like earwigs making chutney,' he muses, and is strong on bird migration. His willingness to swoop around the stage, with impressions of swallows, astronauts and Dracula greatly beefs up the performance. Izzard refuses to appear on television, although he is working on a sit com. He is a rare, unusual talent, aimable, non political, quite decorous in his language. He is quite important so a trip to the Albery is almost essential.</p>

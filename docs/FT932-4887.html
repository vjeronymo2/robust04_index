			<p>930607 FT  07 JUN 93 / Economics Notebook: World trade talks drink in the last chance saloon WHAT are we to make of world trade developments? Last week's annual ministerial meeting of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ended with upbeat noises about progress in the long stalled Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks. But the talk in the corridors was more about managed trade and rising protectionist pressures. The reasons were not hard to find. Over the past three years unemployment in the world's 24 leading industrial economies has exceeded its 1983 record level of 30m and is projected to increase to nearly 36m by the end of this year. Nor do these figures tell the whole story of wasted labour resources. As the OECD noted last week in a special report on unemployment, many workers have withdrawn from the job market because they consider it futile to look for jobs or because they have generous income support. Many people are doing part-time work and there are many low-wage jobs being held by people overqualified for them. At the same time, competition among industrial countries and from the newly industrialising economies of Asia and the recently rehabilitated countries of Latin America has become remorseless. Little wonder the European Commission wants Japan to revise an agreement signed only in April and cut still further its exports of cars and vans to the European Community. Or that in even such a bastion of free trade as the OECD itself, people are beginning to think aloud about whether protection might not be a lesser evil than social unrest caused by mass unemployment. Just before the OECD meeting, Mr Jean-Claude Paye, the organisation's secretary general, told the German newspaper Die Zeit he would 'not rule out protectionism as a policy of last resort'. He readily acknowledged protectionism was stupid and the worst solution to the problem caused by the loss of jobs to the newly industrialising countries. But he said if other policies did not work governments would not be able to avoid 'stepping on the brakes a little'. It would be better, he said, to do 'stupid things, fully realising that they are stupid, than to accept a social explosion'. But while Mr Paye has been developing his vision of apocalypse now, officials from the OECD's member countries have actually begun preparing the trade agenda to follow the present Uruguay Round. The world has moved on since the countries of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade launched the Uruguay Round in 1986. The environment has become a preoccupation in most industrialised countries with the result that environmental policies have begun to impinge on trade. The globalisation of business through trade and investment has meant that a country's competitive conditions and domestic competition policies can affect trade and the access companies have to markets. The Netherlands provides a good example of how environmental concerns and trade can conflict. By tradition and history it is one of the world's free traders. Yet the government has proposed to ban imports of tropical timber taken from forests where there is no scheme for replanting. Elsewhere, measures to restrict imports have been urged or introduced after protests by environmentalists who want action against such perceived abuses as the clubbing of baby seals or experimenting on animals to produce cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. Globalisation has made the dividing line between trade and competition policies increasingly fuzzy. Trade barriers may fall between countries only for companies to find their activities constrained by subsidies to competitors or rules on standards or local content. Government rules on zoning, licensing or pricing can keep new competitors out of distribution systems. Some actions by the private sector can also lead to trade discrimination. The OECD is also concerned that international agreements between companies may result in managed trade. At a less sophisticated level, violence, intimidation and harassment have been used to block competition. In South Korea, for example, there have been cases of cinemas showing locally-made films releasing snakes in rival cinemas showing foreign-made films in an attempt to prevent foreign film makers from increasing their market share. Issues such as these are as good a justification as any for the OECD, where officials from its member countries who are steeped in the differing cultures of trade, environment and competition policy can meet and begin to understand each others' problems. Achieving better communications is half the battle. Trade officials recall that when the Montreal Protocol phasing out production of chemicals that damage the ozone layer was agreed in 1987, it had been negotiated by environmental officials and was 'totally inconsistent' with Gatt rules. This galvanised governments into action with the result the OECD was last week able to produce some procedural guidelines on how to improve the relationship between trade and environmental policies. But this small step can only partially offset the force of protectionist pressures bearing down on - and in some cases being encouraged by - policy makers. Mr Michael Wilson, the Canadian trade minister, won support when he warned against any move to add the emerging trade agenda to the unfinished business of the Uruguay Round. This would make the already difficult task of completing the round daunting, he said. The Uruguay Round therefore remains the ultimate test of the industrialised countries' commitment to the multilateral trading system that has served them well since the second world war. The round is in the last chance saloon. After so many missed deadlines, negotiators risk losing all credibility if they miss the latest target date of December 15. But for all the talk of progress and momentum at last week's OECD meeting, it is too early to bet on a successful outcome against a background of slow growth and rising unemployment in the industrialised world.</p>

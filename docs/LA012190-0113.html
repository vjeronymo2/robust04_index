			<p><P> January 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ADVENTURE TRAVEL: A VISIT TO THE TETONS COULD SEND YOU SOARING  </P> <P> Our adventure began as soon as my wife and I stepped out of the Rendezvous Inn  and soared above the village on a 12-minute tram ride to the 10,552-foot summit  of Rendezvous Mountain.  </P> <P> For the expert skier, black diamond-coded trails such as Alta and the Chutes  plunge down the 4,139-foot vertical drop, America's longest.  </P> <P> High Mountains Helicopter Skiing takes the experienced mountaineer to be  dropped off by chopper on three mountain ranges of untracked powder.  </P> <P> Jackson Hole Mountain Guides and Climbing School introduces you to ice and rock  climbing in the Tetons, and other mountaineering organizations are ready with  climbing programs and experienced guides. National Park rangers lead snowshoe  hikes.  </P> <P> There's no fee for back-country trip permits, but it is necessary to register  at Grand Teton National Park Headquarters in Moose before taking off along  cross-country ski trails into the Teton wilderness.  </P> <P> Weather and avalanche hazard forecasts are provided, with cautions that only  experienced mountaineers with ice axes and other essential equipment should  attempt climbing steep snow slopes.  </P> <P> At Granite Hot Springs south of Jackson, 10 miles of cross-country skiing lead  to rest and recovery by soaking amid snowbanks in 104-degree water. A Jack  London-type adventure is to dog-sled to the hot springs.  </P> <P> Caution and guidance are just as necessary for summer adventuring. The first  time we stood on the banks of the Snake River in Grand Teton Park, the current  looked deceptively smooth. But we quickly got the message: Only experienced  canoeists and kayakers should challenge this swift, cold river.  </P> <P> To preserve its ecology, no motorized craft are permitted on the Snake within  the park. Only hand-propeled canoes, kayaks and rafts are allowed, and they  must be registered at the Park's Visitor Center. Ansel Adams made his famous  painting of the Tetons from the Snake River overlook.  </P> <P> Half a dozen float trip companies offer white-water rafting and "you-paddle"  canoeing and rafting adventures on the Snake River, with professional guides to  prepare the novice or expert for bouncing over the tumbling waters through the  canyons. Fish from the banks of the river. Sometimes you might even sight a  moose.  </P> <P> Competitions are scheduled on the ski slopes around Jackson Hole as Wyoming  begins the celebrations of its 1990 Centennial Year of statehood.

Galleries and playhouses of Jackson make it one of the most important  centers of Western arts.  </P> <P> Jackson Hole is a valley that runs south from Yellowstone for about 60 miles  alongside the Grand Tetons. To fur trapper Davey Jackson in the early 1800s it  was his "hole" between the towering mountains. Around 1820 lonely and somewhat  wistful French-Canadian trappers named the three most visible peaks Les Troi  Tetons, the three breasts.  </P> <P> Congress created the National Elk Refuge in 1912.

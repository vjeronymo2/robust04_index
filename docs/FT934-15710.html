			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Books: A Biggles with brains ANTOINE DE SAINT-EXUPERY: THE LIFE AND DEATH OF THE LITTLE PRINCE by Paul Webster Macmillan Pounds 17.99, 276 pages IT IS March 31, 1931. Andre Gide writes in his Journal from Marseille: 'Greatly enjoyed seeing Saint-Exupery again . . . back in France barely a month now, he has bought back from Argentina a new book and a fiancee. Read one, seen the other. Congratulated him heartily, but more for the book (Vol de Nuit, Night Flight, it won the Prix Femina); I hope the fiancee is as satisfactory . . .' At first she was, magnificently satisfactory, but became less so as the years passed. Paul Webster, the Guardian's man in Paris, in his thoughtful new biography of Saint-Ex quotes a contemporary description of her: '. . . a typical South American; small and graceful with strikingly beautiful hands and arms. Her black eyes were captivating, rather like small stars, and her skin was wonderful'. She became immortalised as the solitary desert Rose defended from attackers by its sharp thorns in Saint-Ex's charming fable, The Little Prince. He had met her in Buenos Aires during an Alliance francaise lecture tour for French writers. The year before in 1930 Saint-Ex had published his first novel Courrier Sud (Southern Mail). It was based on his experiences as a pioneer aviator for Aeropostale opening up the route from Toulouse to Dakar, and his glamour as author-airman proved irresistible to the bohemian Salvadorean, whose maiden name was Consuelo Suncin de Sandoval. She was in her mid-twenties and so was he. But unlike him she had already been married to another legendary literary man, the Guatemalean duellist Enrique Gomez Carillo. Saint-Ex was still sexually naive after a protected Catholic French provincial up-bringing. He had had one callow affair with Louise de Vilmorin, yet another novelist and later a friend of Nancy Mitford. She was the sort of match Saint-Ex's aristocratic family hoped he would make, but that had petered out. Instead he married Consuelo in 1931. As Webster shows it proved to be a stormy union, a case of Beauty and the Beast, generating much acrimony but never resulting in complete loss of love and respect. Consuelo must have known from the start that she was in competition with a deadly rival, the air. Saint-Ex was a French Biggles, an overgrown schoolboy who possessed a surprisingly fine mind. Airborne, he experienced Yeats's 'lonely impulse of delight', was like TS Eliot's 'Guitterriez, avid of speed and power' and his career might easily have inspired Auden's Journal of an Airman ('You are a man, or haven't you heard/ That you keep on trying to be a bird?'). In those days flying was matter for poetry. The pilots with their goggles and leather jackets, their controls freezing up, and their not infrequent crash landings, still exert a potent magic, as Michael Ondaatje showed when he re-created the whole era in The English Patient. In the course of his flying hours Saint-Ex had several spectacular prangs. He lost control of one of the early French flying-boats narrowly escaping drowning. But it was his desert landings while flying over the Spanish Sahara that gave him his greatest thrill. Wind, Sand and Stars - the English title of his most intellectually probing book says it all. In searching for a colleague marooned in the desert, captured by nomadic tribesmen, he landed on a 300-metre high plateau. 'These untrodden few acres of the world, which he saw as a table-cloth spread under the apple-tree of the night sky, contain the elements of the innocent poetry of The Little Prince', says Webster. As a writer Saint-Ex belongs firmly to the Right, the Romantic French Right, though he never joined forces with Maurras or anything noxious of that kind. One of his greatest friends was a Jewish anarchist, Leon Werth, with whom he shared an admiration for Pascal. They marvelled at Pascal's prose, discussed Pascalian apologetics and then played chess together. The combination of man of action and thinker is an attractive combination that colours all Saint-Ex's writing. At his best it does have a Pascalian clarity. His thoughts during the Fall of France were set down in Pilote de Guerre (Flight to Arras), 1942. Though by then more than 40, he was still flying dangerous reconnaissance missions. Up in the cockpit Saint-Ex sees the result in human terms of the collapse of France spread out below him, the endless streams of peasant villagers fleeing in the face of the German advance, and he muses on the futility of it all. From his Olympian vantage-point he works out a philosophy of regeneration through sacrifice. He escaped from France and spent years from 1942-1944 in America. He remained however a Petainist nursing an ineradicable hatred of De Gaulle. He seems, in the face of worsening relations with Consuelo, to have conceived a death wish and he somehow succeeded in 1944 in getting accepted for flying duty once again. He was signed on to make sorties on the Mediterranean Front. Three months later he was dead. Exactly how he died still remains a mystery; there were persistent rumours of suicide; it must have been when his Lightening aircraft hit the sea - a death Saint-Ex had rehearsed more than once. Webster covers the whole of St Ex's career adroitly while keeping his own feet firmly on the ground.</p>

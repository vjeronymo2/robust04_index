			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Spurs victory takes shares to four-year high Shares in Tottenham Hotspur yesterday climbed 19p to a four-year peak of 144p as the north London football club reaped the benefits of its successful league form. About 45,000 shares were traded as the price jumped to its highest level since Mr Alan Sugar, chairman of the Amstrad electronics group, took a stake in the club in 1991. Yesterday's rise, prompted by the club's third win in four games, boosted the value of Mr Sugar's 50.88 per cent holding to Pounds 11.7m. Analysts were reluctant to forecast likely pre-tax profits for the year to May 31, due next Thursday, but predicted that operating profits before transfer fees and provisions could rise from Pounds 1.34m to about Pounds 2.5m. The share price increase, meanwhile, lifted the company's market capitalisation by some 15 per cent to Pounds 23.1m - a threefold increase on the Pounds 7.6m value in 1991 when Mr Sugar joined forces with Mr Terry Venables, the former team manager, to mount a bid. At that time, Mr Sugar and Mr Venables paid 75p a share for a 37 per cent stake.</p>

			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / The G7 Summit: Tariff-cutting deal lifts hopes for Uruguay Round - Long and difficult talks lie ahead before pact is sealed / Free trade for many manufacturers, Gloom on G7 economies, Gatt talks given 80% chance THERE was no shortage of superlatives in Tokyo yesterday as the ministers of the Quad group of countries unveiled their tariff-cutting deal to the world's press. But even the most jaundiced veteran of successive 'breakthroughs' in the seven-year history of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations found it difficult not to be impressed by the package unveiled by negotiators from the US, the European Community, Japan and Canada. Nobody was hiding the fact that long and difficult negotiations lay ahead before the Quad 'market access' pact could be talked into a full trade liberalisation agreement under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. But there was a strong sense that the protracted haggling in the early hours of Tuesday morning and the additional negotiations yesterday had brought a qualitative change for the better. One senior EC negotiator, admitting past doubts as to whether the Uruguay Round could be completed successfully, said: 'I am now confident that we can reach a Gatt agreement by the end of the year.' The Quad package envisages substantial tariff cuts for manufactured products, including: Complete elimination of tariffs and non-tariff measures in pharmaceuticals, construction equipment, medical equipment, steel, beer and, subject to certain exceptions, furniture, farm equipment and spirits. The inclusion of spirits among the so-called zero-for-zero products came after a surprise concession by the Japanese negotiators and should benefit exporters of Scotch whisky to Japan, where tariffs will fall by about Y170 (Pounds 1.05) a bottle. Harmonisation of tariffs at low rates for chemical products. The negotiators hope further negotiations will lead to more harmonisation in other areas. Tariff cuts of up to 50 per cent for 'high tariff' products, which carry tariffs of 15 per cent and above. Although there will be some agreed exceptions to this rule, this should be particularly beneficial to European producers of high-quality textiles such as British woollen suits, which should now find the US market more accessible. Tariff cuts averaging at least one third for other products. These include wood, paper and pulp and scientific equipment, which some members of the Quad group had unsuccessfully earmarked for zero-for-zero tariff treatment. Sir Leon Brittan, the EC's chief negotiator, said the tariff-eliminating part of the deal would be especially good for Europe because the EC was a net exporter in all categories of zero-for-zero products except medical equipment. In the area of services, progress has been more opaque. The report prepared by the Quad ministers for the G7 summit said there were many existing offers to improve market access for services. These covered sectors such as insurance, banking, securities, construction, distribution, tourism, software and computer services, professional and business services, including consulting, engineering, accounting and legal services. But the specific commitments to emerge yesterday were vague. In financial services, the Quad countries promised to 'continue their efforts' towards more open financial services markets. In basic telecommunications the way ahead appeared somewhat clearer. The Quad ministers said they would 'pursue a multilateral liberalisation' of the sector within the framework of a draft trade in services agreement and on the basis of a common detailed agenda that they had developed. Whether the package lives up to the description of Mr Mickey Kantor, the US's chief trade negotiator, as the 'biggest tariff-cutting agreement in history' will depend on its successful 'multilateralisation' in Geneva. This is especially true of trade liberalisation in textiles. Mr Hugo Paemen, the chief EC negotiator, pointed out that 70 per cent of US textile trade was with countries other than the Quad group and so further negotiations in Geneva with other Gatt partners would be vitally important for this sector. It was clear yesterday that the participating countries had shown considerable goodwill to bring about the pact. The agreement to include spirits in the products exempted from tariffs was decisive for the success of yesterday's talks and possible only because Japan abandoned a long-held stance. The concession followed the intervention of Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister. The issue had been a major obstacle in Tuesday's late night negotiations and was resolved only after he ordered that spirits be included in the zero-for-zero group. The US also made significant concessions on textiles. Sir Leon pointed out that eliminating tariffs on steel would need not just completion of a Multilateral Steel Agreement but also settlement of the current anti-dumping dispute by which the US has imposed penal tariffs on certain steel imports. A key attraction of making market access the focus of the trade negotiations ahead of this week's summit was the idea that a tariff-cutting initiative would be easily understood by voters as leading to more growth and jobs. Yesterday, G7 spokesmen were quick to claim that the Quad agreement would boost employment. The US said it could eventually add perhaps 2m jobs worldwide while British officials predicted 400,000 new jobs in the UK over 13 years. But, even if the Uruguay Round is successfully completed by the end of this year, it will still be some time before the full effects of yesterday's advance on trade liberalisation is felt by business and consumers. Mr Paemen explained that it would take five years before the tariff cuts could be fully implemented for most products and longer for chemicals.</p>

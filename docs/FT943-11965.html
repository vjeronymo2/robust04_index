			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / Survey of The Bank of England (6): Emu may not be dead after all - Martin Wolf discusses the feasibility of stage three of the Maastricht Treaty It has become a commonplace in the UK that economic and monetary union is so distant a possibility as to be irrelevant. Some continental politicians, notably in Germany, seem to agree that the Maastricht timetable is no longer realistic. The main reason people argue that Emu is off the agenda is that member states will not be able to meet the criteria on inflation, interest rates, exchange rates and fiscal policy laid down in the treaty. This judgment is likely to prove quite wrong with a profound effect on the future of the Bank of England. The average of the Commission's forecast 1994 inflation for the three best performers (France, Denmark and the Netherlands) is 2 per cent. Germany, the UK, Belgium, Ireland and Luxembourg all meet the criterion that their inflation be within 1.5 per cent of this level. In early July, the average bond yield of the three lowest inflation countries (which are not the three countries with the lowest bond yields) was around 7.75 per cent. The interest rate criterion - that bond rates be within 2 percentage points of the average for the three lowest inflation countries - was met by Germany, the UK, Belgium, Ireland and Luxembourg (the latter automatically, by virtue of its monetary union with Belgium). In short, eight countries already meet these criteria. The requirement on exchange rates was that 'a member state has respected the normal fluctuation margins provided for by the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System without severe tensions for at least the two years before the examination'. It may have been serendipity, but the wider bands can now be used to define what is normal. Those with an excellent chance of meeting this criterion are Germany, France, the Benelux countries, Denmark and Ireland. At first glance, fiscal policy is the obstacle. The treaty offers two reference values, '3 per cent for the ratio of the planned or actual government deficit to gross domestic product at market prices' and '60 per cent for the ratio of government debt to gross domestic product at market prices'. The Commission forecasts that Luxembourg and Ireland should meet the first criterion this year, though Germany and the Netherlands will be close (at 3.1 and 3.6 per cent, respectively). The public debt criterion should be met this year by Germany, France, Luxembourg, the UK, though Spain (at 64.2 per cent), Denmark (at 68.5 per cent) and Portugal (at 70.6 per cent) come close. If unchanged, the fiscal position would appear to preclude Emu by early 1997, when a majority of the members need to meet the criteria if there is to be a union. Furthermore, if Emu is to start in January 1999, regardless of the number who meet the criteria, as intended in the treaty, there might be few participants. A monetary union between Germany and Luxembourg would seem a definition of futility. This analysis is misleading because the 'excessive deficit' procedure, of which the fiscal reference values are essential components, is highly judgmental. Furthermore, responsibility for monitoring the member states falls on the Commission, a far from disinterested party. It will be quite easy for the Commission to argue that without the recent recession Belgium, France, the UK and Denmark would meet the deficit criterion. All could, in any case, cut their deficits to meet it; most already have plans to do so. These countries can then be added to Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, which already either meet or almost meet the deficit criterion. Furthermore, as recovery proceeds, deficits should shrink. Deficits can be adjusted quite swiftly, if need be. Barring default, ratios of public debt to GDP cannot be adjusted so swiftly. Furthermore, three member states have ratios of above 100 per cent - Greece (110 per cent), Italy (120 per cent) and Belgium (146 per cent). The Netherlands has a ratio of 81 per cent and Ireland one of 88 per cent, both well above the 60 per cent reference point. The question is whether the debt ratio will be judged to be 'sufficiently diminishing'. If a country has a large enough primary budget surplus - a surplus, excluding interest payments - the ratio will at least diminish. Of the relatively high debt countries, Ireland and Belgium both had substantial primary budget surpluses (of close to 4 per cent of GDP) last year, the Netherlands one of 2.3 per cent of GDP and Italy one of 2 per cent. In 1996, the Commission is likely to argue that the eight countries that already meet the inflation and interest rate criteria also meet the fiscal criteria. Admittedly, the point will be stretched for Belgium. But it is already clear that the others are likely to be cleared, since the Commission has proposed that Ireland not be deemed to fail the fiscal tests, despite the country's high indebtedness, because of its low fiscal deficit. The Maastricht treaty offers two dates on the move to the third stage of Emu. The first is not later than December 31, 1996, by when the Council, acting by qualified majority, shall decide 'whether a majority of the member states fulfil the necessary conditions for the adoption of a single currency'. It seems likely that seven members - Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands - will be judged to meet the criteria. The UK may fail the ERM criterion (by virtue of not being a member), but might meet the others. Denmark and the UK also have opt-outs. Opt-out or no opt-out, the Bank of England may be enjoying no more than an Indian summer of semi-independence. It could well find itself locked in the iron embrace of Emu before the end of the decade.</p>

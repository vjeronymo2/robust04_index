			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / Bonn sends warship to monitor UN embargo THE German government yesterday ordered a destroyer and three reconnaissance aircraft to join allied warships monitoring the UN trade embargo of Serbia and Montenegro. Nato and Western European Union ships will begin monitoring the coast of the former Yugoslavia today. It is only the second time since the founding of the Federal Republic of Germany that Bonn has ordered troops to a possible conflict area. The first was during the Gulf war, when a squadron of German aircraft was sent to Turkey to help protect it against Iraq. Bonn avoided an embarrassing summons to the constitutional court by strictly limiting its armed forces' role in the Adriatic to observation and intelligence gathering. The German destroyer Bayern will not be allowed to stop suspect cargo vessels or use force, Mr Klaus Kinkel, foreign minister, and Mr Volker Ruhe, defence minister, stressed yesterday. It will also have to stay in international waters. The German force's task was information-gathering on behalf of the UN, not armed intervention. 'The object is to smother the war in Yugoslavia,' added Mr Ruhe. The cabinet decision, made in the face of opposition threats to challenge the deployment in the constitutional court, marks an important step in the government's plan to play a fuller role in international affairs. Both ministers made clear the constitution, which in effect prevents German troops from taking part in combat missions outside Nato territory, must be altered as soon as possible. The German move came as Serb forces stepped up attacks on the last Moslem stronghold in eastern Bosnia, despite a pledge by the new Yugoslav premier, Mr Milan Panic, to end the war in Bosnia-Hercegovina. Moslem fighters in Gorazde broadcast an appeal for help as Serb forces continued to shell the town, cut off for three months. 'Gorazde will cease to exist without immediate help from outside,' the fighters said. The bombardment of Gorazde appeared to put paid to chances that Mr Radovan Karadzic, head of Bosnia's Serbs, and a close ally of Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic, would support a ceasefire. HINA, the Croatian news agency, said 31 people were killed and 61 wounded in the attack on the town. Some 50,000 people have sought refuge in Gorazde, normally a town of 20,000. The siege has seen all phone and road links to the outside severed. Across the border in Croatia 11 people were killed in a mortar attack on a sports stadium housing refugees in Slavonski Brod. At least 7,500 people have died in four months of fighting since Bosnia gained independence, and some 1.2m people have fled their homes. Mrs Sadako Ogata, UN High Commissioner for Refugees, yesterday called an international conference on refugees as the exodus from Bosnia-Hercegovina looked set to grow. Hungary and Austria, each with 50,000 refugees from the former Yugoslavia, are to seek international backing for a security zone within the former Yugoslav republics to protect victims of the conflict. The two countries plan to put the proposal, whose idea is borrowed from the operation to save the Kurds from the Iraqi regime, before the Hexagonale group of central European countries this weekend. Hungary and Austria will press the issue at the UN Security Council, where they are both members. The International Red Cross has announced a central regional base in Hungary for supplying refugee camps. Mr Peter Tjittes, regional head, said the supply centre in southern Hungary would make costly deliveries of emergency relief unnecessary.</p>

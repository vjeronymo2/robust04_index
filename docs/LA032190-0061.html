			<p><P> March 21, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOVIETS WARNED BY U.S. ON LITHUANIA;  </P> <P> DIPLOMACY: TROOP MOVEMENTS WORRY WASHINGTON. THE WHITE HOUSE URGES MOSCOW TO  USE CAUTION. SHEVARDNADZE RULES OUT THE USE OF FORCE.  </P> <P> The Bush Administration, deeply worried by Soviet troop movements in and around  Lithuania, warned Moscow on Tuesday against creating an "atmosphere of  intimidation and increasing tension" in the Baltic republic.  </P> <P> White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater issued the unusually tough  statement, warning Moscow against using its army to enforce Soviet control of  Lithuania, which declared its independence March 11.  </P> <P> "The activities and statements of the Soviet government over the past few days  are cause for concern," Fitzwater said, noting "troop movements that have been  sighted along the border, around certain institutions (and) public facilities."  </P> <P> "The United States notes that the Lithuanian government has expressed its  readiness to address all legitimate Soviet interests, including economic  interests, through negotiations," Fitzwater said, adding a call for "the Soviet  government to address its concerns and interest through immediate negotiations  with the government of Lithuania."  </P> <P> Despite rumors in Lithuania, Soviet authorities deny that there have been any  extraordinary or unscheduled troop movements in or near the republic. But on  Monday, Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov ordered various government ministries  to take steps to prevent the Lithuanians from disengaging their economy from  that of the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and the Soviet Parliament have declared  the Lithuanian assertion of independence illegal and invalid, and Gorbachev  said that there can be no negotiations over the issue. But Lithuanian President  Vytautas Landsbergis, acknowledging that his republic cannot survive  economically if it wrenches itself away from the SovietUnion, continues to  express confidence that there will be talks.  </P> <P> In Windhoek, Namibia, where he met with Secretary of State James A. Baker III,  Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze sought to reassure the United  States.  </P> <P> "We are against the use of force in any region and particularly against using  force domestically," Shevardnadze told reporters.  </P> <P> Baker said he accepted the Soviet official's words. "The minister made it very  clear to me that they are hopeful that questions involving Lithuania will be  handled through dialogue," Baker said after his four-hour meeting with  Shevardnadze.  </P> <P> "He said that force would not be a solution to the problem," Baker added. "I  thought he was fairly definitive. . . . There is no reason that we know of not  to take him at his word."  </P> <P> In Washington, however, Administration officials were voicing a far more  skeptical line.  </P> <P> Soviet use of force against the Lithuanians would "kill perestroika with the  West" and complicate negotiations on issues from arms control to German  unification, an Administration official said. Perestroika is the term used to  describe the economic and political reform effort under way in the Soviet  Union.  </P> <P> A forcible suppression of the Lithuanian independence movement would raise  again the fears, for now subdued, that the Soviet leadership "is a bear that  really hasn't filed down its fangs," the official added.  </P> <P> As one of the republics that make up the Soviet Union, Lithuania has a separate  government with limited powers. That government is now controlled by  pro-independence forces. Although the United States has not formally recognized  the new government as an independent sovereign state, American officials never  officially accepted Soviet rule over the region, which was taken over by the  Soviet army during World War II after a deal was struck with Nazi Germany.  </P> <P> President Bush, the Administration official said, had specifically raised the  issue of the use of force in the Baltics when he met with Gorbachev in Malta in  December.  </P> <P> "The President raised the issue of self-determination" and "noted the use of  force would be counterproductive," the official said.  </P> <P> Gorbachev, in turn, assured Bush that force would not be used. He and other  Soviet officials have repeated that pledge since then, even after the  Lithuanian assertion of independence.  </P> <P> Bush and Gorbachev have not specifically discussed the situation in Lithuania,  Latvia and Estonia, the three Baltic Republics, since their Malta meeting. But,  said Fitzwater, the Soviets "are aware of our position" through other  diplomatic contacts.  </P> <P> For the last several days, the Administration had been taking a hands-off  stance toward Lithuania, hoping that negotiations leading to a peaceful  settlement would soon begin between Moscow and Landsbergis' pro-independence  regime.  </P> <P> Bush, commenting to reporters before a meeting with congressional leaders  Tuesday morning, repeated that hope.  </P> <P> "They've been very good about it -- the Soviets have -- all through Eastern  Europe," the President said. "That's what everyone wants to see, a peaceful  evolution in Lithuania."  </P> <P> But the Soviet troop deployments around Lithuania have sent a shudder through  the Administration, which has invested substantial political and diplomatic  resources in supporting Gorbachev and his reform efforts.  </P> <P> The United States appears willing in some situations to accept the Kremlin's  use of its armed forces to put down internal unrest. Earlier this year, for  example, Administration officials offered generally supportive statements about  the use of troops to end unrest in Soviet Azerbaijan.  </P> <P> Lithuania, however, is a "different case," the Administration official said.  </P> <P> "We're tied down with the political aspects of 40 years" of U.S. statements  supporting Lithuanian independence, this official said. In addition, the  movements for independence in the Baltic states enjoy considerable support  among their neighbors in Eastern Europe, the official noted.  </P> <P> Widespread violence in Azerbaijan and neighboring Armenia allowed the Soviets  to claim their military presence was needed to restore order in that situation.  In Lithuania, however, the independence movement has been peaceful.  </P> <P> Although partially overshadowed by the concern about Lithuania, the meeting  between Baker and Shevardnadze concentrated on German reunification and Third  World issues.  </P> <P> Officials on both sides said the talks, which took place at the home of the  U.S. ambassador to Namibia on a hill overlooking Windhoek, were part of the  complex process of fixing the agenda for Bush's summit meeting with Gorbachev,  tentatively scheduled for Washington in June.  </P> <P> Shevardnadze said that at least two more such foreign minister-level meetings  will be required, the first scheduled for April 4-6 in Washington and the  second, not yet set, presumably in the Soviet Union. The two men largely left  arms control matters for those later meetings.  </P> <P> Lauter reported from Washington and Kempster from Windhoek.  </P></p>

			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / Teacher redundancies warning TEACHERS face mass redundancies unless ministers intervene to increase local authority budgets, a teachers' union leader claimed yesterday. Mr Peter Smith, general secretary of AMMA - the second largest teachers' union - said: 'unless action is taken at national and local level, teacher redundancies on a scale never experienced before will hit the profession'. The 145,000-strong union was already dealing with 500 threatened redundancies, he told AMMA's annual conference in Birmingham. Other unions also report a sharp rise in redundancy levels. Mr Smith blamed rate-capping, opting-out, and local management of schools for this 'distressing and serious new scenario.' Most local education authorities are spending up to their capping ceiling this year, and many have reduced school budgets - in real terms - in order to meet a teachers' pay award (7.8 per cent) above the expected level. Under local management - in the process of being introduced across England and Wales - schools receive a budget related to their number of pupils: those with small or declining rolls face a sudden loss of funding. 'John Patten (education secretary) must put an urgent review of local management at the top of his agenda,' said Mr Smith. He claimed that the position was no less serious in the independent sector, where up to 180 redundancies had been made or threatened in recent months - in addition to more than 256 job losses caused by the closure of 10 schools (mainly for girls) since the summer. Still in recession and with fee increases far outstripping inflation, matching this year's state-sector pay award is a serious problem for the independent sector. Several schools are known to have offered less.</p>

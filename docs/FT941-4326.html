			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Grasping the challenge of a new culture - Barclays intends to eliminate its defensiveness to outsiders Surrounded by office furniture that he does not like, in a bank that he says can sometimes be 'stuffy, pompous and snobbish', the chief executive of Barclays warms to his theme. 'I think banks have been misreporting profits for years, and what happened in the late 1980s was grotesquely imprudent.' Mr Martin Taylor pauses a split second to reflect, before continuing defiantly with his rapid flow of words. 'You can quote me on that, although the auditors will probably sue me,' he says, looking pleased at the prospect. A new broom has arrived with a flourish at the UK's largest bank. Mr Taylor, who yesterday set out his thoughts at the clearer's results conferences with the media and analysts, left no doubt that he intends to eliminate its caution and defensiveness when dealing with outsiders. He even broke into French when replying to a journalist from a Parisian newspaper. Harder analysis, and better communication of ideas lie at the heart of Mr Taylor's salvo. There were few clear answers to the problems he set out, but he reiterated constantly that the bank had to understand its own policies better, and then make sure that the outside world understood them as well. He also has a few brisk thoughts about flaws in the bank's structure. One is that it has no strong group identity, but is dominated by the high street bank. 'I think my colleagues from BZW (the investment bank) when they come for group meetings feel they are coming to the clearing bank,' he says. The group is not organised simply enough to allow him to 'get closer to' each business. 'I think at the moment we are very inappropriately organised. The problem is that what people are supposed to be doing and what they actually do is not the same thing.' Changing the culture is a longer-term task, although Mr Taylor insists that it is his central challenge. 'That is what management is about: changing the way that people behave over a long period of time. Surgery is not always needed. You may sometimes just want a properly-balanced diet.' Barclays has been accused of being less meritocratic than other banks, because some senior managers are still drawn from the families whose banks formed it in the last century. Mr Taylor says this is a myth, but that it is still 'encrusted' with a bureaucratic management structure. 'There are traditions that are already being abandoned, the stuffy, pompous and snobbish things. The banking side of this business is far too status conscious for my taste,' he says. But unifying the bank's 'old-fashioned military' traditions with the more free-wheeling BZW will be a hard task. Apart from changing its structure, the most concrete idea that Mr Taylor discussed was Barclays' move towards taking a small general provision against each loan. He hopes this would encourage managers to price loans better. Mr Taylor argues that default provisions would link the pricing of loans with credit risk. 'There is a habit here I was not aware of before I came into backing of thinking of the two things with absolutely different parts of the mind. To me they are two sides of the same coin,' he says. This ties in with a scepticism about the value of taking on loans to support the cost base. 'One thing that I have learned from my industrial background is that marginal business is not always profitable, and sometimes the marginal business in the book is not just the last 5 per cent,' he says. Instead of raising new capital to expand lending, Mr Taylor thinks he can recycle existing capital attached to poor assets. 'I think the bank has a lot of capital poorly employed, and there is value to be added over the next 10 years by working it more intelligently.' Mr Taylor says this would be a more precise process than simply shifting capital among categories of lending such as to large companies. 'If you actually go through the book and say where are we getting good returns, and where not, you can make a very considerable value difference' he says. Indeed, Mr Taylor is preoccupied by the issue of how much capital the bank should hold - as well as what it should do with it. He emphasised that it needed to cover its dividend twice over the economic cycle in order to live on its own resources, and not be driven into rights issues. The bank has already achieved a target of 6 per cent ratio of core capital to risk-weighted assets set last year by Mr Andrew Buxton, its chairman. Mr Taylor says he is re-examining this target. 'Six per cent might well be right, but if it is right, you have to understand why it is.' Mr Taylor says he will explain his conclusion carefully to avoid any misunderstanding. Otherwise, 'They may say 'Ah, they want to have a cushion because there is some disaster around the corner' or 'Oh, gosh, they are looking for an adventure and they are building up firepower',' he says. Part of his challenge is not only to identify the things that are wrong with Barclays, but the traditions that are valuable. He talks admiringly of the ability of Marks and Spencer, the UK retailer, to retain the best of its traditions without becoming bogged down by the past. 'They hang on to the golden thread going back through time that does not change. I am sure that in banking there are also golden threads running back through time,' he says.</p>

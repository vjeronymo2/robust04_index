			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 29 (CNS) -- Information on the  general situation of agricultural production across the country  released by the Ministry of Agriculture indicated that the  harvest of summer crops would be promising but problems  regarding land under spring cultivation should not be overlooked.    Surveys on the spring cultivation conducted by six  investigative teams sent by the State Council to 13 provinces,  autonomous regions and municipalities showed that the situation  was generally good with a return to normal of the area for the  growing of early paddy rice and a rise in area of land under the  cultivation of cotton. The summer crops and summer oil-bearing  seeds have taken a turn for the better. So long as there are no  abnormal weather conditions and proper management is in place, a  big harvest of summer crops is expected while production of  summer oil crops is tending to increase.    Problems of the spring cultivation lie mainly in first, too  great a rise in prices for production means for agriculture,  especially quality chemical fertilizer. Second, some  agricultural production means, particularly quality chemical  fertilizer is in rather great demand and its supply is  relatively in a tense state. Third, difficulties are being  found in keeping steady a certain area under grain cultivation  while it is proving difficult to achieve the expected area for  production of cotton. The total area under cultivation of grain  and cotton therefore continues to decline this year. Fourth,  implementation of the loans policy set by the central  authorities for economic development in some major counties  where commodity grain and cotton are produced is proceeding at a  slow pace.</p>

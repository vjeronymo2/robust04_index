			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / Japan plans to link cable TV services Japan's ministry of posts and telecommunications is drawing up a plan to bring together the country's fragmented cable television operations as a nation-wide network which could provide a full range of multimedia services. The move is to help build up an information super-highway and spur the market for multimedia services. 'We believe that building a (nation-wide) cable TV network will enable advanced services to be realised and that this could eventually become a full service network,' an official said. Such a network could also provide significant competition to NTT, the privatised telecommunications company which still has a virtual monopoly of Japanese domestic telecommunications services. The ministry's decision to support the building of more extensive cable TV networks reflects a growing recognition of the role cable TV is likely to play in providing multimedia services, such as video-on-demand. Until recently, ministry regulations had hampered the growth of cable TV in Japan, leaving the country behind the US in building an information super-highway. In particular, a ministry guideline that required cable TV operators to be locally capitalised had left the industry fragmented, under-funded and unprofitable. The latest ministry plan aims to overcome these problems by encouraging operators to co-operate and extend coverage. The ministry would provide support in making standard the systems used by different cable companies so that they could be linked. Last month Tokyo Electric Power, the country's biggest electric utility, Tokyu, a railway company, and two trading companies, all of which have cable TV interests, linked so as to provide multimedia services on cable. Japan's first fast breeder nuclear reactor is due to go critical today - the stage where a nuclear chain reaction becomes self-sustaining, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Monju reactor in Fukui, eastern Japan, has been under development since 1985 at a cost of some Y600bn (Pounds 3.8bn). It is to be one of the main pillars of Japan's plutonium programme. The launch of Monju, named after a Buddhist saint, comes almost 20 years after similar facilities in the UK and France, and as international concern about nuclear proliferation is increasing.</p>

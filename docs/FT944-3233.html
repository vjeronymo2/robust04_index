			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Southern Electric shows 20% advance to Pounds 107m Southern Electric sustained the momentum of strong profit growth in the electricity sector yesterday as rumours swept the stock market of an imminent takeover bid for one of the regional electricity companies. Southern's shares ended with a gain of 6p to 756p. But Northern Electric, SWEB and Seeboard were among the day's strongest performers as they became the focus of bid speculation. Southern's profits were up 20 per cent to Pounds 106.8m pre-tax on the back of strong demand and continuing cost reductions. Turnover was down as regulatory pressures impacted on electricity prices. Earnings per share improved to 29.69p (24.8p). The interim dividend goes up by 24 per cent to 8.3p  - well below increases announced by other recs during the current reporting season. But Southern was one of only two recs which did not make dividend-enhacing share buy-backs this year. Mr Henry Casley, chief executive, said Southern's region 'has performed well', with units distributed up 3.7 per cent. Growth was especially strong in the industrial and residential sectors. The non-electricity businesses lifted profits by 10.7 per cent, reflecting strength in the contracting and cable-laying operations. But retailing lost money, as did the newly formed gas supply business which Southern said it was viewing with caution. Controllable costs were down 5.6 per cent and manpower down 12 per cent. Southern is now ahead of its job reduction target, but still aims to shed 1,200 of its 4,200 jobs by 2000. Southern has already announced a price freeze and rebates which it said yesterday would bring total savings passed on to customers since privatisation to Pounds 112m. COMMENT Insofar as the market was able to concentrate amid the bid excitement, these were seen as a solid set of figures, confirming Southern's position as one of the sector's soundest, if most conservative, members. The relatively low dividend increase is caused partly by Southern's decision not to buy back any shares, at least until the tax uncertainties of the National Grid sale are out of the way. The shares yield about the sector average, which suggests that Southern's performance inspires respect if not excitement. But the appointment of a managing director yesterday with specific responsibility to find a replacement for Grid earnings also suggests welcome long-sightedness.</p>

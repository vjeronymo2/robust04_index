As a general rule, exports of animals and plants listed on Appendix II of CITES may occur only if a Scientific Authority has advised a permit-issuing Management Authority that such exports will not be detrimental to the survival of the species and if the Management Authority is satisfied that the animals or plants were not obtained in violation of laws for their protection. Based on documentation presented for consideration by the CITES Parties in 1983, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) has determined that the American alligator is listed on Appendix II for reasons of similarity in appearance under Article II.2(b) of CITES as well as the potential threat to the species survival under CITES Article II.2(a). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This notice announces proposed findings by the U.S. Scientific Authority and Management Authority on the export of alligators harvested during the 1995&hyph;1997 taking seasons from certain States previously approved for such export for the 1992&hyph;1994 harvest seasons and for the State of Arkansas which was previously approved for the 1994 harvest season. These proposed findings also stipulate that monitoring procedures previously established for this species be continued. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, references in the regulation concerning the manner in which tags are to be attached to American alligator hides at the time of export and the conditions for export of parts and products are being clarified. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service requests comments on these proposed findings and information on the species involved. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  The Service will consider all information and comments received by January 26, 1995 in making its final decision on this proposal.

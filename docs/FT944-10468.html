			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Amersham restricted to Pounds 19.6m - Analysts trim forecasts as 13% profits growth disappoints City A disappointing performance in Japan and continental Europe limited first half profits growth at Amersham International. The health science group lifted pre-tax profits for the six months to September 30 by 13 per cent to Pounds 19.6m (Pounds 17.4m) on sales up 6 per cent at Pounds 163.1m (Pounds 153.7m). Mr Bill Castell, chief executive, acknowledged that the results were at the low end of analysts' expectations. The share price fell 63p to 928p. He said that the sluggishness of life sciences, the company's largest division, had been caused by bureaucratic delays in government funding of research, especially in Japan and France. Research laboratories are among Amersham's best customers. In addition, the dollar's weakness boosted the competitiveness of US rivals. Life sciences' operating profits were Pounds 15.3m (Pounds 15.6m) on turnover of Pounds 74.4m (Pounds 72.4m). The industrial division, involved in industrial quality and safety assurance, also disappointed. A changing product line had added to costs without adding to sales, said Mr Castell. Operating profits dropped from Pounds 2.9m to Pounds 1.3m. The best performing division was healthcare. Operating profits rose to Pounds 5.5m (Pounds 1.5m) thanks to the performance of new products - Metastron, for cancer pain, and Myoview for imaging the heart. Turnover grew from Pounds 54.7m to Pounds 62.3m. Mr Castell said that the healthcare division would remain the 'major profits driver in the near term'. Earnings per share were 12 per cent higher at 20.8p (18.6p) and the interim dividend is raised from 4.4p to 4.9p. COMMENT Amersham had the highest p/e in the UK health sector - 20.8 - until yesterday's results. The rating was based on prospects for Metastron, a drug which promises to take the company beyond medical imaging into the potentially lucrative field of cancer treatment. However, doctors and drug regulators are conservative folk. Approvals are slow in coming and buyers must be persuaded to change their prescribing habits. Add to that uncertainty over research spending in both public and private sectors as costs remain under scrutiny, and it is just as well that analysts' forecasts have now been trimmed. Pre-tax profits for the full year are likely to fall well short of Pounds 50m, with earnings per share just making it to 50p. Profits are forecast to grow at 20 per cent next year, giving roughly Pounds 57m pre-tax and earnings of 60p. The 1995-96 prospective p/e of 15.5 is still close to the top of the sector. Amersham remains a long-term growth stock, but investors should brace themselves for more short-term weakness.</p>

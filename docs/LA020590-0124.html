Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> MISSING ANCHORS RESIGN TV JOBS;  </P> <P> DIRECTOR JUST SAYS NO TO SEQUELS  </P> <P> Jeff Burr is ready to go back to directing his own films, saying he's  discovered the frustrations of working on sequels after directing "The  Stepfather II" and "Leatherface: Texas Chainsaw Massacre III."  </P> <P> "I've discovered that I just don't have the mental stability or the temperament  to let others interfere with my films," the 28-year-old Dalton native said.  "Plus, doing sequels is really an artistic dead end because the producers want  you to continue to emulate the previous films.  </P> <P> "The next film that I'm doing will have as little interference as possible from  other sources," Burr said during a recent visit.  </P></p>

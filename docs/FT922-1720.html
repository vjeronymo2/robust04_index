			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / How To Spend It: Super sales HOLLY Golightly, you will remember, took herself off to Breakfast at Tiffany's whenever the mean reds hit her. For me, N. Bloom &amp; Son, the jewellers at 40 Conduit Street, London, W1 has played much the same role. If ever I win the pools, N. Bloom is going to be where I head first. It has always specialised in exactly the sort of antique pieces that are deliciously pretty and eminently wearable. For a combination of reasons, mostly connected with the fact that the lease is about to expire and, I daresay, not unrelated to it being hard times for one and all, N. Bloom is about to move and it is therefore having a sale. All jewellery is reduced by 40 per cent and all silver by 30 per cent. This means that, for instance, a Cartier diamond, ruby and sapphire arrow and target brooch is down from Pounds 2,400 to Pounds 1,440, a cameo brooch is down from Pounds 1,450 to Pounds 870. Anyone with Pounds 35,000 to hand will be able to save Pounds 23,500 on an enchanting diamond necklace (once priced at Pounds 58,500). Price's Patent Candle Company is one of those old-fashioned companies that most of us know and love. Although in recent years its image has become a little faded, it has been taken over by new owners who intend to breathe fresh life and energy into it. Next weekend, on Saturday June 27 and Sunday June 28 at its factory at 110 York Road, Battersea, London SW11, it will be having a grand clearout of old stock. Prices will start as low as 20p. A wonderful chance to buy some real archive models. On the Saturday only the factory shop (just around the corner) will be selling church candles (more than 40 different sizes), creamy composition candles (from 26p to Pounds 39.50 for the largest size, 3 ins diameter by 36ins high) and hand-made beeswax candles (50p each for  3/4 ins diameter by 6 ins high). Stock up now for Christmas.</p>

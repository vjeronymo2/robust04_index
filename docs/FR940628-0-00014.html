Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> States containing CO nonattainment areas with design values of 12.7 ppm or less were required to submit, among other things, contingency measures to satisfy the provisions under section 172(c)(9). These provisions require contingency measures to be implemented in the event that an area fails to reach attainment by the applicable attainment date, December 31, 1995. Contingency measures were due by November 15, 1993, as set by EPA under section 172(b) of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Contingency measures must be implemented within 12 months after the finding of failure to attain the CO National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). Once triggered they must take effect without further action by the state or EPA, therefore, all contingency measures must be adopted and enforceable prior to submittal to EPA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The CAAA does not specify how many contingency measures are needed or the magnitude of emission reductions they must provide if an area fails to attain the CO NAAQS. EPA believes that one appropriate choice of contingency measures would be to provide for the implementation of sufficient vehicle miles traveled (VMT) reductions or emissions reductions to counteract the effect of one year's growth in VMT while the state revises its SIP to incorporate all of the new requirement of a serious CO area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. This Action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In this action, EPA is approving Oregon's SIP revision submitted to EPA on November 15, 1993 for Grants Pass, Medford, Portland and Klamath Falls, Oregon because it meets the applicable requirements of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The State of Oregon held public hearings in Grants Pass, Medford, Portland and Klamath Falls on August 16, 17, and 18, 1993 respectively to entertain public comment on the CO contingency measure SIP revision. Following the public hearing, the plan was adopted by the Environmental Quality Commission on October 29, 1993, and became effective on November 4, 1993. The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (ODEQ) submitted the plan to EPA on November 15, 1993 as a proposed revision to the SIP. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The SIP revision was reviewed by EPA to determine completeness shortly after its submittal, in accordance with the completeness criteria set out at 40 CFR part 51, appendix V (1991), as amended by 57 FR 42216 (August 26, 1991). The submittal was found to be complete and a letter dated March 8, 1994 was forwarded to ODEQ's Director indicating the completeness of the submittal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Analysis of State Submission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Oregon's CO contingency plan requires oxygenates to be supplied at maximum allowable oxygen contents (e.g. 3.5% ethanol and 2.7% methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE)). A specified minimum average oxygen content level of 2.9% would be required only if, in subsequent control seasons, the projected control area average oxygen content would be less than 3.1%. This projection will be based on reported oxygenate mix information submitted by the regulated community. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If any of Oregon's four CO nonattainment areas fail to meet applicable standards by the December 31, 1995 Clean Air Act (CAA) deadline, or in any subsequent year prior to redesignation to attainment, implementation of the contingency provision will be formally triggered by written notification to ODEQ from the EPA, or by written notification from ODEQ to affected fuel suppliers in order to give as much lead time as possible to implement the CO contingency plan for the 1996&hyph;97 CO season. Oxy-fuel suppliers will be provided at least eight months to implement CO contingency plans from the time notification is received from ODEQ or from EPA, whichever is sooner. ODEQ would expect to notify suppliers no later than March 1 in order to ensure that oxy-fuel is supplied for the entire winter CO season. EPA is legally required to make such notification within six months of the end of calendar year 1995. If a standard violation occurs during 1994, the above implementation time frame could be accelerated by as much as two full years. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After the CO contingency plan is triggered and oxygenates are being supplied at maximum EPA approved levels, ODEQ will assess seasonal oxygenate mix reports to project whether an average control area oxygen content of 3.1% will be reached in subsequent control periods. If ODEQ's projection indicates that the oxygen content will be less than 3.1%, a 2.9% mandatory average oxygen content to be achieved by all Control Area Responsible Parties (CARs) and blender CARs, will be implemented for future control periods. If mandated, a 2.9% oxygen content level could be achieved by: (a) Using only ethanol as an oxygenate; or (b) through an averaging program using MTBE or other oxygenates and ethanol. An averaging program would require that at least 25% of the total volume of fuel supplied to a control area be oxygenated with ethanol to meet an oxygen content of 3.5%. The remaining 75% of total volume could be oxygenated with MTBE or other oxygenates at a 2.7% level to yield an average oxygen content over the control period of 2.9%. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA recently promulgated regulations for reformulated gasoline that control the oxygen content of gasoline under section 211(c)(1) of the Act in certain ozone nonattainment areas, 59 FR 7716 (February 16, 1994). Since the reformulated gasoline program would not apply to the gasoline marketed in the Oregon CO nonattainment areas at issue here, EPA does not believe that Oregon's contingency measures to impose controls on oxygen content beyond those statutorily required under section 211(m) would be preempted under section 211(c)(4) of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to the CO contingency plan, the revision contains housekeeping changes to clarify and improve the organization of the oxy-fuel regulations to minimize misinterpretation. EPA approves of these changes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Administrative Review  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, Part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve requirements that the state is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-state relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The CAA forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Union Electric Co. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> U.SE.P.A. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 427 U.S. 246, 256&hyph;66 (S.Ct. 1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because EPA considers this action noncontroversial and routine, we are approving it without prior proposal. The action will become effective on August 29, 1994 unless adverse comments are received by July 28, 1994. If the EPA receives adverse comments, the direct final rule will be withdrawn and all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on the proposed rule (please see short informational notice published, simultaneously, in the proposal section of this  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nothing is this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future document will inform the general public of these tables. On January 6, 1989 the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for two years. The EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on EPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by August 29, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements.

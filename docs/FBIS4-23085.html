			<p>Scoring   "Phased Solutions," Syria Leaves Slight Wiggle Room                             SUMMARY   Syria's blanket rejections of "phased settlements"--a prominent  theme during Secretary of State Christopher's recent visits--are  in effect conveying to the Syrian public that Damascus will not  accept any peace settlement without prior Israeli commitment to  withdraw fully from the Golan Heights, while leaving open the  possibility of gradual, reciprocal steps to exchange land for  peace if full withdrawal is predetermined.  Maintaining slight  flexibility, Damascus has repeatedly articulated its opposition  to any "phased settlement" by defining it as precluding total  withdrawal and has refrained from publicly demanding a specific  timetable for Israel's return of the Golan.                           END  SUMMARY   Against the background of the Secretary's 29 April-1 May and 15-  18 May shuttle visits between Syria and Israel, Damascus  repeatedly stressed its opposition to the notion of a peace  settlement in stages--a consistent theme in Syrian rhetoric since  September 1992, when it began negotiating with a Labor government  in Israel (see box).  For example, reacting to a plethora of  Israeli media reports on claimed Israeli draft proposals that  were said to involve phased withdrawal from the Golan in exchange  for measures to establish peaceful relations, one Damascus radio  commentary criticized Israel for "talking about testing Syria's  intentions" over "several years" and warned that "Israel wants to  drag the Arab parties participating in the peace process into  partial, phased agreements" (22 April).  Coinciding with the  Secretary's talks in Damascus on 18 May, the daily Al-Thawrah  asserted that "since the beginning Syria has been aware of the  fact that the path of peace does not pass at all through partial  solutions, phased settlements, or individual deals" (Damascus  radio, 8 May).  Syria's closely controlled media have continued  this line since the visits, with a Tishrin editorial on 1 June  citing Israeli offers of "partial solutions and phased  settlements" as evidence "that Israel is the party responsible  for wasting time and for undermining the peace process" (Damascus  radio).    Accordingly, Damascus publicly dismissed the possibility of a  "Majd al-Shams First" arrangement, rumored by Israeli media as a  plan by which Israel would withdraw from four Druze villages in  the Majd al-Shams area of the Golan Heights as an initial step  toward a full peace settlement (Qol Yisra'el, 29 April).  At the  end of the Secretary's first series of talks in Damascus, Foreign  Minister Faruq al-Shar' was quoted by Reuters news agency as  declaring in response to a question on phased withdrawal that "we  will not accept peace in stages" (1 May).  Asked about the "Majd  al-Shams First" idea, he reportedly dismissed it as a "silly  proposal."  That reaction was echoed in somewhat milder but no  less derisive terms in Syrian media, which compared "Majd al-  Shams First" to "Gaza-Jericho First," the Israeli-Palestinian  agreement that Syria regularly vilifies in its media (for  example, Al-Ba'th, as reported by Damascus radio, 4 May).   "Phased Settlement" Means "Partial Withdrawal"   Nevertheless, Syria has tended in its public statements and media  commentary to characterize the notion of "phased settlements" in  such narrow terms as to avoid shutting the door entirely to any  gradual measures to exchange land for peace.  By consistently  portraying "phased settlement" as virtually synonymous with  partial Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights, the Syrian  public line has focused exclusively on the demand for a clear  Israeli commitment to full withdrawal.  For example:   -- During the SMEC's visit to the region last October, an  editorial in the daily Tishrin rejected a phased settlement by  maintaining that "Israel wants to transform the phased settlement  into a permanent settlement; that is, it wants to buy time,  prolong the negotiating process, and manipulate its course to  keep Arab territories" rather than accept a commitment to full  withdrawal (Damascus radio, 20 October 1993).   -- In a joint press conference with visiting Secretary  Christopher last December, al-Shar' was asked about rumors of a  U.S. draft proposal involving a four-stage Israeli withdrawal  from the Golan.  While denying the existence of such a proposal,  he nonetheless declared that "Syria rejects this proposal,"  explaining that "we in Syria will not accept the achievement of  the aspired peace in the region unless there is full withdrawal  from the occupied Syrian Golan" (Damascus TV, 9 December 1993).   -- Following Secretary Christopher's 1 May talks in Damascus, al-  Shar' was quoted by Syrian media as asserting that "Syria rejects  peace in stages with Israel" and that "it insists on total  withdrawal from the Arab occupied territories as a condition for  the establishment of peace in the region" (Al-Bath and Al-  Thawrah, 2 May).  Al-Shar' was subsequently quoted by Damascus  radio as telling a visiting Swiss official that "the Israeli  proposals conveyed by Secretary Christopher during his latest  visit did not help achieve progress because they were based on  premeditated Israeli intentions not to fully withdraw from the  territories that were occupied in 1967" (Damascus radio, 19 May).   Through such rhetoric, Syria, in effect, appears to have limited  the scope of its public rejection of phased settlements to a  rejection of any such solution insofar as it precludes or fails  to guarantee total withdrawal.  The implication was underscored  in Syrian media coverage of al-Shar's remarks to Reuters on 1  May.  Omitting his characterization of the "Majd al-Shams First"  proposal as a "silly idea," the media cited him as addressing the  proposal by saying simply "that Syria's position is the return of  the Golan in full" (Al-Ba'th and Al-Thawrah, 2 May).   Demands on Timetable Vague   Damascus also has continued to avoid wedding itself before the  Syrian public to a specific timeframe for Israeli withdrawal from  the Golan Heights.  In contrast to its consistent calls for  "immediate" withdrawal of Israeli forces from Lebanon, Syria's  demands for Israeli withdrawal from the Golan--since the start of  the current peace talks in October 1991--have almost always  either avoided the question of a timeframe or referred to it in  vague terms.  Accordingly, in December 1992, Syrian media made no  mention of comments at a Washington news conference by Muwaffaq  al-'Allaf, chief Syrian negotiator in the bilateral talks with  Israel, in which he appeared to demand an extremely short  timeframe for Israeli withdrawal (see Note 1).   (Note 1)   Al-'Allaf had stated in response to a question that an  acceptable Israeli withdrawal would involve "not phases in terms  of weeks and months but the necessary thing which is logistically  needed" (Federal News Service transcript, 17 September 1992).   Against the background of the Secretary's recent shuttle  diplomacy, Syrian media stepped up general calls to establish an  Israeli timetable for withdrawal but continued to avoid specifics  other than urging that the timeframe be "quick" (for example,  Damascus radio, 26 and 29 April; Tishrin editorials as reported  by Damascus radio, 4 and 16 May).  Another editorial in Tishrin  used still more general wording, insisting merely that Israel  commit itself to "full withdrawal from the Golan within a  reasonable and acceptable period of time" (Damascus radio, 15  May) (see Note 2).  Since the visit, al-Shar' was reported by  Egypt's official news agency, MENA, to have been asked during a  visit to Cairo whether Syria could accept an Israeli withdrawal  from the Golan over a period of three years.  He responded, "We  will not talk about these details until after Israel agrees to  the principle of full withdrawal" (MENA, 31 May).   (Note 2) Syrian delegation spokeswoman Bushra Kanafani used  similar phrasing two years ago in demanding a timetable for  Israeli withdrawal, but her comments--conveyed in response to a  question at a Washington news conference--were not carried by  Syrian media (Federal News Service, 14 September 1992).   Implications   Through its negative public treatment of "phased settlements,"  Damascus continues, in effect, to prepare the Syrian public for  either a deadlock in the peace process or a peace agreement  involving no less than an explicit Israeli commitment to full  withdrawal from the Golan Heights.  Beyond this public bottom  line, however, Damascus has in effect neither encouraged nor  discouraged Syrian public perceptions that the government would  consider reciprocal phased measures toward normalization of ties  in return for Israeli withdrawal, if the Israelis were to commit  themselves in advance to an eventual full retreat.  In any event,  the vagueness of Syrian demands for a withdrawal timetable likely  reflects the recognition that if such withdrawal is agreed to, it  will be undertaken in stages over a number of years.   Box:  No "Phased Settlements": A Staple of Syrian Rhetoric   Opposition to a "phased settlement" has been a consistent theme  in Syrian media through much of the current peace process.  For  example:   -- In a speech before the United Nations General Assembly in  September 1992, al-Shar' declared that while "the road to a  comprehensive and just peace is clear and well known, . . . any  maneuvers to carry out partial withdrawal or phased steps will  not bring peace to the region or Israel" (Damascus TV, 28  September 1992).   -- Damascus radio asserted in December 1992 that "Syria will  never go along with partial solutions or phased withdrawals" (16  December 1992).   -- At the end of Special Middle East Coordinator (SMEC) Dennis  Ross' visit to the region last July, a Damascus radio commentary  claimed that "the problem is still in Israel," which it said  "insists on a peace by installments and by phased settlements  aimed, as they say, at testing the Arabs' peaceful intentions"  (14 July 1993).

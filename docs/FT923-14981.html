			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading BANK of England moves in the money markets led to suggestions of an impending interest rate cut and prompted a strong advance in stock index futures, writes Joel Kibazo. The September contract on the FT-SE was already strong in early trading. Then, the Bank of England moves in the money markets provided an impetus for the September contract to advance sharply and reach 2,532, the day's high, by mid morning. Thereafter, the contract traded within a narrow range of 2,520 and 2,530 for the rest of the session. With Wall Street closed, the momentum was maintained by the firmness in the fixed income markets. September closed at the session's high of 2,532, up 43 on the previous session and around 18 points above its estimated fair value to cash of about 25. Turnover of 6,366 lots was, however, light. In traded options, turnover was down on the past two sessions reaching 31,570 lots by the close. The FT-SE contract traded 12,845 lots and the Euro FT-SE, 2115 contracts. Asda was the busiest stock option with a day's total of 2,007 lots.</p>

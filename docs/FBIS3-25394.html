These incidents occurred while a  rally for political parties grouped within the Democratic  Coordination [as heard] was taking place. To reestablish and  maintain order and ensure the free movement of persons and the  protection of property, the security forces intervened in  several districts of the department. The demonstrations claimed  victims among the security forces. They are Moustapha Diane  (?guardian) of the peace; Ibrahima Saib, guardian of the peace;  Dauda Ndour, guardian of the peace; and Abou Han, guardian of  the peace. They were all members of a mobile intervention  force. There was a civilian victim among the demonstrators.  Civilians were also seriously wounded. The government [words  indistinct] before the memory of the dead, and presents to their  families its deepest condolences. The government strongly  condemns these acts of vandalism, which can in no way  destabilize the democratic republican institutions that are the  basis of a country that respects the law. It reaffirms its  solemn determination to do everything possible for the law to  prevail, for state authority to be reinforced further every day,  and for the security of the public to be guaranteed efficiently  by the law. The instigators and authors of these acts of  vandalism and destabilization shall be sought, arrested and  punished acording to law. Finally, the government pays tribute  to all the security forces -- police, Gendarmerie, and the  National Army -- for their acts of determination and patriotism.  The government expresses [words indistinct] renews support in  the accomplishment of their noble mission in the service of the  nation.</p>

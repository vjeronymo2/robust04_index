			<p>BFN     [Text] Vienna, May 20 (AFP) -- The International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA) Friday [20 May] rejected a North Korean  proposal to keep fuel rods from a controversial nuclear reactor  in a "safe place under seal" ahead of resumed talks on the  issue, an IAEA spokesman said.    "That won't work. We will no longer be able to verify with  certainty if any of the nuclear material has been diverted,"  from the Yongbyon experimental reactor, he said.    The North Korean ambassador to China, Chu Chang-Jun, told a  Beijing press conference Friday North Korea would keep "the fuel  rods in a safe place, under seal in order that the inspectors  can verify that nuclear material has not been diverted to  non-peaceful ends.    "When the next round of discussions takes place between  North  Korea and the United States and a technical solution is found,  then the agency will be able to take its samples," the  ambassador said.    The IAEA said late Thursday that North Korea has begun  extracting fuel rods from its five-megawatt Yongbyon reactor in  a "serious violation" of IAEA inspection terms and said it would  inform the UN Security Council.    The removal of the rods, if not halted immediately, could  wreck the IAEA's attempts to see if fuel had already been  diverted, the IAEA said.    The agency called on North Korea to allow immediate  inspections and to delay the extraction of fuel rods until  arrangements were in place.    "No North Korean response to our demands has reached us,"  the  IAEA said.    The three agency inspectors in North Korea are attempting to  check whether any of the 8,000 nuclear fuel rods in the reactor  have been diverted and used to nuclear weapons.    The IAEA said it would still be possible to carry out  inspections and offered to send its top officials to discuss how  it could be done.</p>

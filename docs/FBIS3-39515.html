			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Vuk Draskovic, leader of the Serbian Renewal </F> Movement by Paolo Borelli in Rome; date not given--recorded;  Draskovic and Borelli speak in English with voice-over in  Italian paraphrasing their questions and answers]    [Text] Vuk Draskovic, the leader of the opposition in  Belgrade and therefore the main enemy, at least ideologically,  of Serb President Milosevic, is paying a visit to Rome. He will  have meetings with Foreign Minister Andreatta and with Chamber  of Deputies Speaker Giorgio Napolitano and Senate Speaker  Giovanni Spadolini. Draskovic will outline his peace plan for  the former Yugoslavia during his talks with them. Paolo Borelli  reports:    [Borelli] You have opposed the war and Milosevic. Milosevic  sent you to prison last year. Why is it that this same  Milosevic is talking to your movement and saying he is ready for  peace?    [Draskovic] Milosevic, like Tudjman, is being forced by the  facts to make peace. Yes, it is strange that those who started  the war have now become the champions of peace. But this is not  the first time this has happened. In Israel, Menachem Begin,  who had a terrorist, anti-Palestinian guerrilla background,  received a Nobel prize for peace with Egypt.    [Borelli] What will happen when the ultimatum expires on  Sunday night [20 February]?    [Draskovic] The Bosnian Serbs must give up the siege of  Sarajevo completely. I think they will do so. This means that  first they have to place all their arms under the control of the  UN forces in the city and its surrounding area. The second  step, according to my party's plan, calls for Croats and Muslims  to place their weapons under UN control also. The third step  will be the disarming of the three sides and the handing over of  war criminals for trial. The process of disarmament should be  carried out by the soldiers of the four powers: the United  States and British should disarm the Croats and Muslims; Russia  and the French should disarm the Serbs.</p>

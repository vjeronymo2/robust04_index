			<p>BFN     [Text] Dear friends: Australian Prime Minister Paul  Keating will pay his first official friendship to our country at  the invitation of Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet. In today's issue,  NHAN DAN carries an editorial pegged to this event entitled: In  the Interests of the Vietnamese and Australian Peoples and for  the Sake of Peace, Cooperation, and Development. The editorial  reads in part as follows:    Following the first official visit to Australia by our prime  minister in May 1993, the Vietnam visit by Australian Prime  Minister Paul Keating has drawn the attention of broad sections  of public opinion in the region and other parts of the world.  This important event marks a new developmental step in the  friendly and cooperative ties between Vietnam and Australia.    Vietnam and Australia established diplomatic relations in  1973. The friendly and cooperative ties between the two  countries have continued to develop with each passing day since  then based on the principles of mutual respect, mutual  understanding, equality, and mutual benefit. Australia highly  valued Vietnam's renovation achievements in all fields as well  as Vietnam's foreign policy of diversification and  multilateralization and its efforts to improve relations with  many countries in the world, especially in the Asia-Pacific  region.    Australia lifted its trade embargo at an early date and  resumed its development aid for Vietnam. It has also shared its  experiences and stepped up cooperation with Vietnam. The  cooperative ties between the two countries have been improved  step by step. Both sides have worked together toward the goals  of implementing agreements on economic and trade cooperation,  thereby creating favorable conditions for increasing the value  of bilateral trade activities to $70 million in 1991 from $2  million in 1982 and to $252 million in 1992 and then to $366  million in 1993. Australia has become Vietnam's seventh trade  partner and ranks fifth on the list of foreign investors in  Vietnam with 26 projects valued at $776 million.    Australia has also helped our country with the training of  hundreds of specialists; the formulation of laws on mining,  telecommunications, and state management over  telecommunications; and the enhancement of farmland irrigation,  hydrometeorological, public health, and tourist sectors in which  Vietnam has a need and Australia has great potential and high  technologies.    Regarding many regional and international issues, Vietnam  and  Australia have reached more and more consensus on the need for  peace, stability, and development in the Asia-Pacific region  that the two countries have regarded as the top priority  objectives of their foreign policies.    We hope that Prime Minister Paul Keating's official  friendship visit to Vietnam will end in success, help strengthen  mutual understanding, and lead the multifaceted cooperation  between Vietnam and Australia to a higher level, a larger scale,  and a broader scope for the sake of each country's prosperity  and in conformity with the common trends of peace, cooperation,  and development in the Asia-Pacific region.</p>

			<p><P> April 2, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN COURT: A SUMMARY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA-RELATED BUSINESS LITIGATION  DEVELOPMENTS DURING THE WEEK OF MARCH 26:  </P> <P> Law Firm Accused of Wrongful Firing: The prominent Los Angeles law firm of  Latham &amp; Watkins was sued in Los Angeles Superior Thursday by a former  paralegal who claims that she was fired for "blowing the whistle" about the  firm's alleged overbilling.  </P> <P> Robyn R. Devereaux said she was terminated after two years because she told the  firm's clients, opposing attorneys and a federal judge about alleged  overbilling by Latham in litigation over the DuPont Plaza Hotel fire in Puerto  Rico. Steven Stanwyck, the law firm's attorney, said the allegations are  groundless and called Devereaux a convicted felon who has other actions pending  against the firm.

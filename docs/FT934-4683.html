			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / International Capital Markets: Net sales of gilts could be cut to Pounds 26bn in 1994-95 The UK government bond market could be looking at dramatically lower net sales of Pounds 26bn in the forthcoming financial year as a result of the lower Public Sector Borrowing Requirement and the chancellor of the exchequer's Budget decision to 'sell some Pounds 7bn fewer gilts than would otherwise be necessary to fund the PSBR through to the end of 1994 - 95'. The gilt market was clearly delighted with Mr Kenneth Clarke's forecasts for a diminishing PSBR over the next few years, which implies a sharp decline in supply. While there was no official revision for the 1993 - 94 PSBR in Tuesday's Budget, some City economists expect that the original Pounds 50bn forecast may turn out to be too pessimistic. However, the chancellor gave the gilt market two shots of good news for the next financial year (1994 - 95). First, the PSBR is forecast to be Pounds 38bn rather than the Pounds 44bn which Mr Norman Lamont, the previous chancellor, projected in March 1993. Second, Mr Clarke said that Pounds 6.8bn of gilt sales from the 1992 - 93 financial year would be used for funding between now and the end of the 1994  -95 financial year. This follows from a change made to the funding rule in March 1993 whereby gilt sales to the monetary sector (banks and building societies) which in the past had not counted towards funding, would do so in future. Mr Lamont said then that retrospective account would be taken of the Pounds 6.8bn of purchases made in 1992 - 93 'over the next two to three years' but did not specify when. The implications of these two measures are that the Bank of England will not need to issue so heavily in the gilt market. So far this year the Bank has issued about Pounds 43bn of gilts which will fund the estimated Pounds 50bn PSBR, leaving an estimated Pounds 7bn more funding to complete this financial year. The Bank has another Pounds 3bn auction lined up for December 8, and in all likelihood will continue to hold auctions and issue stock through the first three months of 1994 - provided market conditions remain favourable - with the result that it will 'over-fund' for 1993 - 94. Many gilt specialists believe the Bank would be wise to over-fund while conditions are good and there is a bull market for gilts. With a 1994 - 95 PSBR of Pounds 38bn, the Bank may be looking at net gilt issuance of Pounds 26bn (taking into account the Pounds 6.8bn from gilt sales to banks and building societies in 1992 - 93 and estimated National Savings sales of Pounds 5bn). Taking into account gilt redemptions, gross issuance would be around Pounds 34 - Pounds 35bn. The Bank has been very successful in its funding programme in the last two years, during which gilts have rallied strongly. Provided market sentiment remains good and there are expectations of further base rate cuts, the funding task should not prove onerous. Mr John Kendall, economist at Baring Sterling Bonds, says the chancellor should not rush to cut the base rate to 5 per cent, but should keep the gilt market on its toes waiting for the next half-point easing. 'If they cut again too soon, there's a danger the market will think that is it and the next move will be upwards,' he said.</p>

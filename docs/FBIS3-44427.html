It is the first time Taiwan has been chosen to host an APEC  seminar since the regional economic cooperation organization was  formed in 1989, the sources said.    The seminar, to be held February 1-3, will focus on new  energy technologies, energy conservation, more efficient uses of  energy resources, transformation of waste into energy, the  environmental impact of energy resources exploration, and  regional cooperation in energy development.    The government-funded Industrial Technology Research  Institute will organize the seminar with the assistance of  Japan's New Technology Development Organization.    Energy administrators and experts from all APEC member  states  are expected to attend the seminar. APEC groups 17 economies,  including the United States, Canada, Japan, New Zealand,  Australia, South Korea, Taiwan, Mainland China, Hong Kong,  Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia,  Brunei, Papua New Guinea and Mexico.    The Republic of China [ROC] expressed its intention to host  the seminar in October 1992, but the APEC energy working group  did not make a final decision on the site of the meeting until  late last year for fear of offending Beijing.    APEC has in the past organized short-term study tours of  Taiwan, but has never sponsored a formal session here.    APEC has nine working groups. Aside from the energy task  force, it has panels responsible for manpower resources  planning, technology transfer, telecommunications, fishery  resources, transportation, tourism, trade promotion and  investment cooperation.</p>

			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Southnews improves 32% to Pounds 651,000 Pre-tax profits of Southnews, the USM-quoted London regional newspaper publisher, increased by 32 per cent, from Pounds 494,000 to Pounds 651,000, in the six months to September 28. The outcome was achieved on turnover up by just Pounds 41,000 to Pounds 7.19m and was boosted by a reduction in the interest charge from Pounds 157,000 to Pounds 20,000. The directors said that in September the bank balance became positive for the first time since 1988, and would remain so for the foreseeable future. The company also announced the sale of its publishing interests in Worthing, West Sussex, and this marked the completion of the programme of disposals of titles in peripheral geographical areas. The proceeds of the sale would added to existing cash reserves, the directors said, to help fund future expansion. Earnings came out at 2.84p (2.13p) and the interim dividend is increased to 0.7p (0.5p).</p>

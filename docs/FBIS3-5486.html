In a meeting with officials of the Federation of Economic  Organizations (Keidanren), representatives of the Japan Trade  Union Confederation (Rengo) suggested that the proposed agency  should not include retired bureaucrats, so as to remain  independent from the government.    The idea was put forward by the advisory group for economic  structural reform, headed by Keidanren Chairman Gaishi Hiraiwa,  when the government advisory body unveiled a package of measures  to ease state regulations and boost the Japanese economy late  last year.    The Keidanren officials supported the Rengo suggestion and  said the federation will convey the request to Koshiro Ishida,  director general of the Management and Coordination Agency, in  late March.    The bilateral meeting also dealt with tensions in the trade  ties between Japan and the United States, and the domestic  economy.</p>

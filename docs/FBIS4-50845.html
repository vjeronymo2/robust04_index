State Councillors Li Tieying and Peng Peiyun are the  honorary leaders of the Chinese delegation.

It is the largest international  comprehensive games held in China in this century after the 11th  Asian Games and also the first international games for the  disabled hosted by China. Preparations for the games are in  full swing. We warmly welcome disabled athletes from various  countries and areas in this region to gather in Beijing during  the games to talk about their friendship, win good results in  the games, display the special styles of the sports of the  disabled, and, seizing this opportunity, promote the "10-year  Asia-Pacific disabled persons" activities and bring about the  progress and development of the undertakings for the disabled.

At the last two Olympic Games  for the disabled and other important competitions, China's  disabled athletes won 205 gold medals, 102 silver medals, and 45  bronze medals and broke 36 world records. At the Fifth Far East  and South Pacific Games for the Disabled held in Japan's Kobe in  1989, the 56-member Chinese delegation won 99 gold medals,  winning the first place in the total number of gold medals.    Deng Pufang concluded that he was convinced that inspired by  the spirit of "equal participation, friendship, and progress,"  the sixth Far East and south Pacific region games will be a  success.

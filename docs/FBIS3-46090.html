Provincial CPPCC Chairman Long Zhiyi chaired the session.  [passage omitted]    Provincial Party Secretary Liu Fangren made an important  speech at the opening ceremony.    [Begin Liu recording] Today, at a time when people of  various nationalities throughout the province are  comprehensively implementing the instructions of the 14th CPC  National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC  Central Committee and are emancipating their minds, seeking  truth from facts, widening the opening up scope, and seizing the  opportunity to expedite their development, the Second Session of  the Seventh Provincial CPPCC Committee has opened in Guizhou.  On behalf of the Guizhou Provincial CPC Committee, I extend my  warm congratulations to this session and my kind regards to all  CPPCC members and comrades present here.    The year of 1994 will be the first year to comprehensively  implement the decision of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th  CPC Central Committee as well as the first year to  comprehensively implement all the tasks set by the Seventh  Provincial CPC Congress. To fulfill this year's tasks, the  provincial party committee has explicitly proposed that, under  the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic  line, we should implement the instructions of the 14th CPC  National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC  Central Committee, focus on economic construction, further  emancipate our minds, seek truth from facts, expedite reform,  widen opening up, boost our morale, work in a down-to-earth  manner, and promote the province's socialist market economy,  party building, spiritual civilization, and the formation of the  democratic and legal system. [passage omitted]    We should correctly handle the relations between reform,  development, and stability and unite people of all nationalities  throughout the province in preserving and developing the  political situation characterized by stability and unity. To  provide a good social and political environment, we should do  two types of work simultaneously, lay equal stress on both, and  carry forward socialist spiritual civilization. All this has  set higher demands on the provincial CPPCC this year.    In this year, CPPCC organizations at all levels throughout  the province should conscientiously study Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics, profoundly implement the instructions of the  14th CPC National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the  14th CPC Central Committee, conscientiously carry out all the  tasks set by the Seventh Provincial CPC Congress, uphold the  party's basic line, further abide by and improve the CPC-led  multiparty cooperative and political consultative system, and  raise the province's patriotic united front work to a new level.  [passage omitted]    In cooperation with the relevant departments, the CPPCC  organizations at all levels throughout the province should do a  good job in accommodating overseas friends who come to Guizhou  for family visits, sight-seeing, and trade discussions; should  promote scientific, technological, and cultural exchanges with  foreign countries; and should encourage more friends to invest  in Guizhou. They should tell potential investors about the  party's policy of peaceful reunification and one country, two  systems and should describe for them the province's scenic spots  and the people's habits and customs to expand our influence.  [passage omitted]    CPPCC organizations at all levels should conscientiously  study Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng  Xiaoping, should study and implement the party's line,  policies, and principles, should further improve their  ideological and theoretical level, should improve their ability  to participate in the deliberation of state affairs, and should  make greater contributions to the province's two civilizations.    All levels of party committees and governments should  further  improve their understanding of the CPPCC's nature, position, and  mission, should seriously implement the CPC-led multiparty  cooperative and political consultative system, and should  vigorously support and propagate the CPPCC, political  consultative, and democratic supervisory systems. [passage  omitted]    Party committees at all levels should strengthen their  leadership over CPPCC organizations -- first and foremost their  political leadership over CPPCC organizations. CPPCC  organizations at all levels should carry out their work  according to the party's line, principles, and policies by  focusing on economic construction and the work of party's  committees and governments. All levels of party committees and  governments should solicit the opinions of CPPCC organizations,  democratic parties, mass organizations, and nonparty patriotic  individuals. The relevant departments should seriously handle  important suggestions and criticism raised by CPPCC  organizations and nonparty individuals. Difficulties that CPPCC  members encounter in work and life should be resolved with every  possible effort. [end recording]</p>

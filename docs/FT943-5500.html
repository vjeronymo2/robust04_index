			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Bus side fuels strong advance at Henlys Strong demand for buses helped pre-tax profits at Henlys, the motor trading and bus and coach manufacturing and distribution company, jump from Pounds 3.22m to Pounds 8.46m in the six months to June 30. The result included a Pounds 1.9m profit from property sales. Turnover rose from Pounds 188.2m to Pounds 199.5m with the motor division contributing Pounds 159.8m (Pounds 154.5m) and the coach and bus side Pounds 39.7m (Pounds 33.7m). 'Trading conditions remain competitive but we are encouraged by the rate and strength of growth in the bus and coach division,' Mr Robert Wood, chief executive, said. A strong demand for buses helped push vehicle registrations up by 17 per cent in the period. Operating profits in the coach and bus division rose from Pounds 438,000 to Pounds 3.18m contributing to a 69 per cent rise in total operating profits to Pounds 7.24m (Pounds 4.27m). Mr Michael Doherty, chairman, said the order book for this division was at a record high and the company planned to increase production to meet demand. Badgerline recently announced a Pounds 22m order for 836 bus bodies. He said manufacturing output had increased by a quarter in the first half. Flat turnover in the motor division was partly because of the company's reluctance to take on fleet business where margins were very slim, Mr Doherty said. A fall in after-sales profits offset a slight increase in vehicle sales profits. An interim dividend of 2.5p (1.5p) is payable on earnings per share of 14.5p (6.4p). The March rights issue raised Pounds 25.8m, leaving Henlys with net cash of Pounds 8.7m. Last time there were borrowings of Pounds 23.9m representing gearing of 50.7 per cent. Interest charged fell from Pounds 1.33m to Pounds 753,000. COMMENT A sound set of results led by the bus and coach division. Pent up replacement demand from the bus industry which continues to recover and the coach sector which is showing tentative signs of improvement should contribute to further growth. Although turnover in the motor division looks flat, the strategy to steer away from high volume low margin fleet business seems to be paying off. The company's desire to broaden its franchise base and reduce its high volume business through acquisitions makes good sense. The shares remain attractive with profit forecasts of Pounds 13.4m for the full year and a prospective p/e of 15.</p>

			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Calluna seeks USM float via placing Calluna, a Scottish company which designs and manufacturers miniature hard disk drives, is seeking a flotation through a placing on the Unlisted Securities Market later this month. It hopes to raise between Pounds 10m and Pounds 12m mainly to boost working capital and step up production. The placing is sponsored by Albert E Sharp. Calluna makes high capacity 1.8' disk drives - the size of a credit card - which can be inserted into slots conforming to the PCMCIA industry standard in the latest generation of personal computers. The drives enable computer users to expand their storage capacity, transport data and remove large amounts of data from PCs for security reasons. The company was founded in Glenrothes, Fife, in 1991 by six former employees of Rodime, a Glenrothes-based company which produced the world's first 3.5' hard drive in 1983 but later gave up manufacturing. Calluna developed the world's first 1.8' hard disk drive capable of storing more than 80 megabytes of data. It makes 130MB and 170MB drives and will soon launch a 260MB product, all under the Callunacard name. It has arrangements with distribution companies in Europe and the US. Calluna raised Pounds 5m in December 1992 from 3i and other institutions and in March this year Albert E Sharp attracted investors who put in about Pounds 2m. In the year to March 31 1994 Calluna lost Pounds 2.1m on sales of Pounds 300,000. The Scottish company, which employs 40 people, is the only producer of miniature disk drives in Europe, but faces competition from three rivals in the US, the established disk drive maker Maxtor and two recent startups. It believes the market for miniature disk drives is poised for growth and quotes an estimate by an industry analyst that worldwide shipments will rise from 50,000 in 1993 to more than 3m units in 1997.</p>

			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / French regional finance reform French prime minister Edouard Balladur has agreed to early reform of local government finance after his interior minister, Mr Charles Pasqua, threatened to resign if he did not. Mr Balladur had wanted to delay, until after the presidential election in a year's time, action on an issue that divides the two components of his coalition government  - the UDF centre-right, which believes in regional autonomy, and the RPR Gaullists, who believe in a more centralised state. But Mr Pasqua, the RPR interior minister, has championed the need for France's central government to step in to reduce growing regional fiscal disparities over the past decade, and as one of the most popular and populist ministers he was strongly placed to insist.</p>

The political forecast does not predict  any break in the clouds. With two presidents for one office, it  is a real predetermined battle that the two groups of senators,  including those elected on 18 January, are engaged in for  control of the office. Both teams confront each other on the air  with public accusations.    On 9 March, the office of Senator Sansaricq made a point of  bringing the battle into the realm of management by the other  president, Firmin Jean-Louis, and Quaestor Larosiliere.  Referring to some preliminary results of an audit in progress on  Jean-Louis' management, Bernard Sansaricq is already accusing  these colleagues of embezzlement, and is threatening to engage  Justice.    [Begin recording] [Sansaricq in Creole] The former office,  which was acclaimed by Caputo and Despuy, but which was not  constitutionally elected in compliance with the internal rules  and the Constitution, from 10 August to 4 February blocked not  only the Senate of the Republic, but also the country. We have  found corruption in that administration -- what else can I tell  you? I will tell you to wait until the audits are over because  the same thing happened in Brazil, where 20 legislators are in  prison because of corruption. When the audit is over, you never  know what can happen. I am determined to take things all the way.    [Correspondent Jean-Max Blanc in French] Since you compare  the current situation within the Senate with the situation in  Brazil, do you think the Haitian senators will have the same  fate as the Brazilian senators?    [Sansaricq in French] Once we definitively establish proof,  yes. Once we establish proof, contact our lawyers, and meet with  the public prosecutor, definitely yes. I am determined to do  that.

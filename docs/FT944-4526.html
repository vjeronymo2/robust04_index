			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / World Trade News: Taiwan closer to entry agreement If China's negotiations to join the World Trade Organisation became seriously bogged down, it would raise questions about the fate of Taiwan's application to join the organisation. At present there is an informal understanding that China, on its own insistence, will enter first. However, western trade experts say Taiwan has gone much farther to meet the demands of members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 'Taiwan has worked very hard and put together a good package,' said a spokesman at the US's de facto embassy in Taiwan. He said bilateral trade talks in mid-November were 'very successful' although several areas had not yet been finalised. Trade experts say it would be up to Taipei to propose any change in arrangements to allow it to enter the WTO before China. Such a move would risk the wrath of Beijing and would have to be approved by Gatt members. 'Our view has always been that Taiwan and the People's Republic of China must put together good accession packages,' the US spokesman said. 'But the decision is up to all member governments.' Taiwan has made or is negotiating the finer points of concessions on imports for a range of agricultural and industrial products. Taiwanese trade officials say the government is considering imposing non-tariff barriers in place of duties to protect local industries following admission to Gatt. Taipei has largely conceded to US demands to open its market to rice imports, a politically sensitive issue. It is likely to adopt Japan's approach, which allows for a six-year adjustment period. It has also agreed to dismantle its alcohol and tobacco monopoly.</p>

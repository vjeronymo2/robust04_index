			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Hopes for a deal amid the rhetoric: Nancy Dunne reports on the US-Japan trade talks as Washington's deadline looms US and Japanese officials are heading into the final week of trade talks with at least partial agreement in sight after 15 months of fruitless negotiations. With a September 30 deadline for agreement looming, the rhetoric on both sides has been tough. President Bill Clinton last week warned Mr Yohei Kono, Japan's foreign minister, of sanctions. Japanese officials have advised the US not to count on last-minute climb-downs. But an important obstacle to agreement was cleared off the table last week when Tokyo announced a stimulative tax cut package. The US has been pushing for such a move since the signing of a broad trade framework agreement in July 1993 by Mr Clinton and Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa. Agreement is likely on other fronts. In disputes over procurement of telecommunications and medical equipment and on Japan's insurance market, agreement has been close since last February's Washington summit, when Mr Clinton and Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa failed to reach a compromise and the markets reacted violently. There is also hope for agreement on flat glass, a dispute added to the agenda along the way. Japan flew a special negotiator in to work on glass last week, and US officials on Friday gave the Japanese negotiators a proposed draft text to be studied over the weekend. A stumbling block remains in talks covering vehicles and parts. Even though the sector comprises some 60 per cent of the Dollars 60bn (Pounds 38bn) US trade deficit with Japan, the urgency for its resolution has abated. All US car companies are enjoying healthy sales and profits. Exports to Japan are rising rapidly, though starting from a minuscule base. The concern now is vehicle parts, which involves more companies, many of them hit hard by competition from Japanese transplants. US car makers have been lobbying for a tough line, in anticipation of pressure from Wall Street for a deal at any cost. Although these 'results-oriented' trade talks were supposed to show a sharp departure from past efforts to open the Japanese market and sound a tougher note, the similarities are more apparent than the differences, said Mr Fred Bergsten, head of the Institute for International Economics and one of the trade specialists the Clinton administration is consulting as the talks progress. The talks, moving product-by-product, represent 'a hard slog to unearth and deal with specific Japanese practices' which discourage imports, Mr Bergsten said. Although the US has sought benchmarks - 'objective indicators' - to measure progress, it has from the first insisted that failing to meet those targets would not subject Japan to trade retaliation. In the flat glass talks, for example, foreign glass manufacturers have for years sought to break into a market dominated by three Japanese producers, whose market share rarely varies and whose wholesalers are discouraged from buying imports by 'strong-armed pressure tactics', according to the US industry. Mr Steve Farrar, director of international business for Guardian Glass, said the US companies were looking for assurances that the links between suppliers and wholesalers would be broken. 'We are working to get public statements from the wholesalers and manufacturers and a commitment from the ministry of trade and industry that they will monitor the implementation of these statements,' he said. By September 30, the US administration must also decide whether to cite Japan and others for trade practices which raise barriers to exports. Mr Bergsten is counselling against such a move now that strong multilateral trade rules, agreed in the Uruguay Round, offer a viable alternative to unilateral action.</p>

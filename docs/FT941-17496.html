			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / Forecast '94: A rich harvest - The UK economy will continue to grow The UK economy is like the little girl in the nursery rhyme. When conditions are bad, they are horrid; and when they are good, they are very good. The historical record shows that low inflation and interest rates coincide with rapid growth of output and employment; and high inflation and interest rates are associated with slow growth or even falls in output and employment. Good figures for 'real' and 'financial' variables tend to be bunched at the same time - as, too, do poor figures for both types of variable. The latest boom-bust cycle has illustrated the pattern to perfection. In 1987 and 1988 non-oil output grew by more than 4 per cent a year, while the annual rate of retail inflation remained at about 5 per cent until mid-1988. By contrast, in 1990 output went up by  1/2 per cent and in 1991 it fell by more than 2 per cent, but inflation was more than 7 per cent and in late 1990 it peaked at more than 10 per cent. At first glance, this is rather strange. Common sense tells us that inflation ought to be worst when demand is strong, not when the economy is growing at an above-average rate, while inflation ought to be low when demand is depressed. The real variables ought to be good when the financial variables are bad, and vice versa. Does not the actual experience of the economy - that real and financial variables are good and bad together - seem anomalous? Don't the facts contradict common sense? Isn't there a puzzle here? Actually there is no puzzle. The economy's behaviour is fully consistent - with both common sense and economic theory. The vital distinction is between levels and rates of change, and the key to understanding is to recognise that the direction of inflation depends not on the rate of change of output (relative to trend) but on the level of output (also, relative to trend). Consider the economic situation in late 1989. Output had grown continuously since mid-1981 and, for three years - 1986, 1987 and 1988  - it had grown above the long-run sustainable rate. As a result, the level of output was higher than the trend figure, perhaps by as much 4 per cent. The economy was over-stretched. Companies found it difficult to find workers with the right skills at the right price, machinery was being fully utilised and commercial property was in short supply. So pay and price rises were accelerating, and rents soared by 30-40 per cent a year. The government's agenda was plainly to curb demand and to bring the level of output back towards its trend. But one year of slow growth was not sufficient. Although the  1/2 per cent output growth in 1990 was 2 per cent beneath the trend rate of change, it still left the level of output 2 per cent above trend in late 1990. Inflation was therefore still rising at that time. Only with the sharp drop in output in 1991 was enough spare capacity created in the economy for inflation to start falling. The year from mid-1990 to mid-1991 saw the combination of the highest inflation in a decade, a slump in output and a steep climb in unemployment. The economic situation was horrid. What does this analysis imply for 1994 and, by extension, for the mid-1990s? The answer is that 1994 and the mid-1990s should be a complete contrast to the miseries of the recession from which we are now emerging. They could be the best years for the British economy since the 1960s. The rationale for forecasting a benign phase of the cycle is similar to our description of the last recession, except that the argument runs in reverse. Whereas in late 1989 the level of output in the economy was 4 per cent above trend, in early 1993 it was at least 4 per cent beneath trend. Logically the excess of trend output over actual output was associated with strong downward pressure on inflation. By late 1993 the figures for the 12-month change in retail prices were the lowest for 30 years. Demand and output grew in 1993, possibly by more than 2 per cent. But this was not an above-trend figure for the rate of change. So in early 1994 the level of output will still be 4 per cent beneath trend and inflation will continue to decline. Indeed the only way to stop inflation falling yet further is to boost the level of output to the trend figure, which implies that the rate of change of output has for a time to be well above trend. Thus growth in 1994 and 1995 of 4 1/2 per cent in each year (that is, 2 per cent above the 2 1/2 per cent trend for two consecutive years) would eliminate the excess of trend output over actual. If rapid growth persisted in 1996, this might reignite inflationary pressures from early 1996 onwards. However, it is much more plausible that growth in 1994 and 1995 will be only a touch above trend at, say, 3 or 3 1/2 per cent. The level of output would then still be beneath trend in early 1996. Incredible though it may sound, inflationary pressures ought to go on weakening in 1994, 1995 and 1996. The latest news on inflation and growth has, in fact, been much better than generally expected. Not only has inflation tumbled to low levels, but output and employment have made solid gains in recent quarters. The provisional national accounts statistics indicate that gross domestic product rose by a little above  1/2 per cent in the third quarter. But separate data on employment show that the workforce in the service sector soared by the astonishing figure of 149,000, or by 1 per cent (that is, by an annualised 4 per cent). Part of the explanation may be the buoyancy in City financial services, connected with surging turnover in foreign exchange and bond trading, and high prices in bond and equity markets. With the latest surveys from the Confederation of British Industry suggesting that demand and output in manufacturing is satisfactory, the economy as a whole may be expanding at slightly above trend. The year ahead is starting on the right note - in spite of the adverse effect on spending power of the tax increases announced in the two Budgets of 1993, and in spite of the continuing recession on the Continent. The mid-1990s may prove to be not just good, but very good for the UK economy. For the next two or three years inflation comfortably within the official 1-4 per cent range can be reconciled with above-trend growth and falling unemployment.

			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Restrictions on radio licences inequitable Sir, Raymond Snoddy reported in one article on November 17 ('Capital may seek all four regional licences') that Capital Radio 'under the points system for limiting the concentration of radio station ownership, Capital (Radio) has the leeway to buy a number of new licences or even a national commercial station' and that it might bid for all four regional licences that are due to be advertised. In a separate article in the same edition, he reported that GWR Group had been prevented from making an acquisition by The Radio Authority ('GWR acquisition plan is blocked by Radio Authority'). How can it be that Capital Radio, one of the biggest independent radio contractors in the world and four times the size of GWR, can have this leeway when GWR is restricted? Surely the time has come for there to be a level playing field in the radio industry. The subject is presumably on national heritage secretary Stephen Dorrell's agenda, but is probably not very high on the list of priorities: the industry is seen to be a success and not in need of emergency service. The reality is that the industry is a success despite the legislation and that the legislation needs urgent revision. It should be the duty of The Radio Authority and the national heritage secretary to take urgent steps to eliminate such restrictive ownership anomalies.

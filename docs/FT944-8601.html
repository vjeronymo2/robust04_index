			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / How To Spend It: Trooping the colour the glamour-puss is back. Here comes the femme fatale, a dead ringer for Gianni Versace's Cyber Princess, teetering on her vertiginous heels, all dressed up in a languid, bias-cut slip of a dress and an elegant string of pearls. It is a look that only truly comes into its own at night, and it needs the make-up to match. A full, red mouth is the hallmark of this winter's face. lf you buy nothing else, buy a red lipstick. Reds, as every woman knows, come in many shades, and the rule of thumb is to take time and trouble to find the one that suits your mood: rich, vibrant and glossy for when you're feeling vampish; the barest of lip stains for when you want to show some restraint; or a deep vermilion for when you want to throw caution to the wind. For the faint-hearted, deep reds can be diluted with lip balm. For the bold and confident, a lip liner should be used first - to create a perfect lip shape and then the chosen red should be applied with a lip brush. There are shades of red for every skin tone. Go for a dramatic look in the evening. Draw a smoky line inside and outside the edge of the eye. For the really daring, coloured eyeshadow - even bright China blue, until recently a definite no-no - looks new and fresh. Every cosmetic house worth its lip gloss has come up with the foundations, the blushers and the colours that this winter's face requires - at a price. You could spend as little as pounds 29.70 at the least expensive house or as much as pounds 219 on the basic essentials for the new haute chic look. Here, we chart the price of the look from four cosmetic houses.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- THE COST OF LOOKING GOOD  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- MAC Foundation                    pounds 15.50 Sheer Concealer                      pounds 7.00 Medium Blusher                        pounds 8.00 Shy Pink Highlighter                    pounds 7.00 Wisp Mascara                        pounds 8.50 Black Eyeshadow                      pounds 7.00 Cosmic Blue Lipstick                       pounds 8.00 Red Hot Lip pencil                     pounds 6.50 Cherry Lip treatment                  pounds 8.00 Vitamin E Stick/Emollient Powder                         pounds 8.00 Loose  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- TOTAL COST                    pounds 83.50  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- MAC cosmetics are available from 109 King's Road, SW3, and at Harvey Nichols, Knightsbridge, SW1  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- LANCOME  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Foundation                    pounds 16.00 Macquimat Ultra Naturel Concealer                     pounds 12.50 Effacernes Longue Tenue Blusher                       pounds 16.00 Blush Subtil Highlighter                   pounds 16.00 Blush Sculpture Eyeshadow                     pounds 16.00 Ombre Subtile In Bleus d'azur Mascara                       pounds 13.00 Intencils in Black Lipstick                      pounds 11.50 Rouge Essentiel Lip pencil                    pounds 12.00 Stylo Levres In Vermillion Lipstick (semi-transparent)   pounds 11.50 Brilliant Beige Powder                        pounds 19.50 Poudre Majeur in Translucide  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- TOTAL COST                   pounds 144.00  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- COLOURINGS  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Foundation                     pounds 3.25 Extra Cover Concealer                      pounds 3.95 Lightning Touch Blusher                        pounds 2.95 Soft Red Highlighter                    pounds 2.75 Calico Eyeshadow                      pounds 2.75 China Blue Mascara                        pounds 2.75 Black Lipstick                       pounds 2.85 Scarlet Lip pencil                     pounds 2.00 Flame Red Lip tint                       pounds 2.95 Natural Powder                         pounds 3.50 Translucent Loose  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- TOTAL COST                    pounds 29.70  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Colourings is the Body Shop's own range of cosmetics and is available at all of its branches  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- CHANEL  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Foundation                    pounds 25.00 Teint Extreme Lumiere Concealer                     pounds 15.00 Estompe Lumiere Blusher                       pounds 22.00 Joues Contraste Eyeshadow                     pounds 28.00 Sublimes Highlighter                   pounds 28.00 Modeleur Ombre et Lumiere Mascara                       pounds 28.00 Cils Caresse Lipstick                      pounds 12.00 Rouge Coromandel Lip pencil                    pounds 13.00 Rouge Lip gloss                     pounds 24.00 Indice Rouge Powder                        pounds 24.00 Poudre Lumiere  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- TOTAL COST                   pounds 219.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

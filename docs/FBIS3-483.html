The inauguration of the new  ruling body is also to coincide with the disarming of the  various factions by the ECOWAS peace monitoring group, ECOMOG  [ECOWAS Cease-Fire Monitoring Group]. Reports say ECOMOG has  set up six sites around Monrovia where weapons will be  collected. The United Nations is supervising the disarmament  process but reports say that Mr. Taylor's faction is still  uncooperative.    [Begin Taylor recording] We will fight and continue to fight  anyone wanting to subvert the sovereignty of this nation by  trying to take this land. They will have to fight me and  everyone else after me if they intend to stay here forever. [end  recording]    While the ECOMOG troops man checkpoints and ensure general  security of life and property arms are still carried freely by  members of the warring factions. Interim President Amos Sawyer  is wary of this development.    [Begin Sawyer recording] We see that in Somalia; we see that  elsewhere. Why are we immune from that kind of business, and why  do we need anybody to go out there and stir this up? [end  recording] [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Shumeyko, chairman of the Russian </F> Federation Federal Assembly Federation Council, by ITAR-TASS  correspondents Vladimir Korochantsev and Yuriy Pichugin in  Pretoria; date of interview not stated: "Vladimir Shumeyko: We  Support RSA's Desire for Democracy and Are Prepared To  Cooperate"]    [Text] Pretoria -- "Russia and South Africa have much in  common in the present transitional period of their development  and that creates very good preconditions for fruitful  cooperation between them." That was stated by the head of the  Russian delegation, Vladimir Shumeyko, chairman of the Russian  Federation Federal Assembly Federation Council, in a talk with  ITAR-TASS correspondents in Pretoria, where he was attending  Nelson Mandela's inauguration ceremony.    "I formed this impression as a result of meetings with RSA  President Nelson Mandela, First Deputy President Thabo Mbeki,  and Deputy President Frederik de Klerk," he said. "During my  talk with F. de Klerk we reached the common opinion that our  states are sufficiently prepared for the successful continuation  and development of all-around relations, especially as this  cooperation does not have to be begun from nothing.    "For me as head of the Russian parliament's upper chamber  and  chairman of the CIS interparliamentary assembly, it is  particularly important to ensure the development of  interparliamentary ties," the head of the Russian Federation  delegation stressed. "We are now faced with the task of  creating within the framework of the CIS model legislation for  the former republics of the Soviet Union. Its fulfillment could  lead to the point where cooperation between Russia and the RSA  grows into the same kind of cooperation that exists with the  other CIS states.    "Excellent prospects are opened up for collaboration in the  political field in connection with the fact that warm, friendly  relations have formed between Russian Federation President Boris  Yeltsin, RSA President N. Mandela, and Deputy President F. de  Klerk within the framework of a process which today is called  the humanization of politics. We all remember that in the past  Frederik de Klerk, as president of the RSA, at a hard time for  our country in October last year, supported Russia in a speech  he delivered. Such things are not forgotten and they lay the  foundation for the further development of our relations.  Russia's firm support for the present democratic reforms in  South Africa is expressed in President Yeltsin's message which I  presented to RSA President Mandela and in his verbal message to  F. de Klerk.    "In my talk with F. de Klerk I voiced the thought that the  international public does not have the right to leave South  Africa without attention after the victory of the democratic  elections. It is not ruled out that after the voting and the  inauguration everyone will calm down and the RSA will be  abandoned to the tyranny of fate. Nothing like that should  happen. So I allow the possibility of appealing to the  international community to continue to support South Africa and  to display attention toward it and its development.    "In that sense our bilateral economic ties are important  and all necessary conditions exist for their development and  expansion. The RSA has its problems connected with the  emergence of its commodities and technologies onto the world  market after the application of all-embracing and primarily  economic sanctions against it for decades. That country was  obliged to develop its own modern technologies. Now with the  lifting of the boycott South Africa is faced with the task of  ensuring an outlet for these technologies onto the world market.    "Russia is in need of such cooperation and our market is in  a  certain sense boundless with regard to this cooperation just as  the South African market is boundless for many Russian goods,  particularly conversion goods. Simple and cheaper consumer  goods could be suitable on the local market. We can also  discuss military cooperation separately. We discussed all this  at meeting with President Mandela and F. de Klerk.    "During my stay in Pretoria I was convinced that the present  leadership has favorable opportunities for close collaboration.  At least I formed the opinion that the president and his two  deputies have a great personal liking for each other. And that  is already half the battle, or even more than half. If  politicians treat each other in a normal, human way that helps  resolve many complex tasks.    "Many good words can be said about the RSA. Its sincere  desire to ensure successful democratic development gives rise to  the warmest feelings," V.F. Shumeyko stressed. "With its  expanses and wide open spaces and boundless fields that country  reminded me of my Russian home."</p>

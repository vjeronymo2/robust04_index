			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Enterprise/Lasmo The latest exchanges in the Lasmo bid battle have a rather desultory air about them. Lasmo's Colombian find provides a modest boost to its claim that a focused exploration strategy is paying off. Similarly, Enterprise has scored a small victory by forcing Lasmo to modify claims that it had had little international success. But all this is pretty minor stuff. What the market is waiting for is an improvement in Enterprise's all-paper bid. Today's announcement of the level of acceptances at the first closing is expected to confirm that there is little enthusiasm among Lasmo shareholders for the current offer. Given that Enterprise's chairman Mr Graham Hearne is not about to retreat in the same way De La Rue did last week, an enhanced bid is on the cards. But Lasmo shareholders should not count on a dramatic improvement in the offer. There is no sign of any white knight, so Enterprise is not under any competitive pressure to increase its bid. Nor does it have the financial resources to put up large amounts of cash. In fact, Enterprise would probably need underwriting if even a modest portion of the bid were to offered in cash. In the circumstances, it is hardly surprising that some Lasmo shareholders have been taking the cash in the market with the result that the company's share price has taken a slight knock. But it is still comfortably above the value of the Enterprise offer.</p>

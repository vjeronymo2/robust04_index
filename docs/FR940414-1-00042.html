			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA also conducted a study of ultrafiltration (UF) and reverse osmosis (RO) membrane separations technologies. This study tested the effectiveness of ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis to obtain a clean, reusable water stream and to generate a concentrate that could be recovered for its product value. Membrane separation processes utilize a pressure driven, semi-permeable membrane to achieve selective separations. The pore size of the membrane can be relatively large if precipitates or suspended materials are to be removed from a wastewater, or very small for removal of inorganic salts or organic molecules. During operation, the feed solution flows across the surface of the membrane. Water permeates the membrane, and the contaminants remain in the now more concentrated feed solution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An earlier study had shown that reverse osmosis treatment alone was not effective for formulating and packaging wastewater. This was attributed to the presence of emulsifiers and surfactants that are formulation components that subsequently contaminated the wastewater. The surfactants or emulsifiers with a somewhat higher molecular weight than the other components were not only retained by the RO membrane, but also caused fouling and gumming of the membrane, which reduced its effectiveness. Therefore, the EPA studied a treatment train consisting of ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis. The ultrafiltration was added to remove larger molecular constituents such as the emulsifiers and surfactants from the wastewater. A major advantage of the process is that not only can a high quality product water stream (permeate) be produced, the membrane-rejected material can potentially be recycled back into the formulating and packaging process, substantially reducing the amount of material requiring disposal. The concentrates from both the UF and the RO units were evaluated for recoverability.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Bench-scale tests using wastewaters from two PFPR facilities were tested using UF followed by RO. Also, jar tests were performed to evaluate alternative physical/chemical methods of pretreating the wastewater before RO treatment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two separate systems were used for the ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis tests. The bench-scale systems were designed to use commercially available ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis equipment, while keeping the size of the systems as small as possible. This design approach was selected to provide results representative of a full-scale system, while minimizing the amount of wastewater which had to be collected, shipped, and ultimately disposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The results of the UF/RO study show this treatment sequence was effective in removing the nine active ingredients present in the wastewaters taken from the two PFPR facilities. Ultrafiltration pretreatment prevented rapid fouling of the RO membrane. For all but one of nine active ingredients (2, 4&hyph;D, Dicamba, MCPP, Prometon, Bromacil, Benthiocarb, Diuron, Terbufos, and Tebuthiuron) better than 99% removal was accomplished by the treatment sequence. Data for Bromacil indicate it was reduced by 89.3%; however, this percent removal may misrepresent the treatment performance because there is some indication the measurement of Bromacil in the untreated wastewater was affected by analytical interference and thus could have been present at a higher concentration that was measured. The UF/RO treatment sequence appears to be a very effective alternative to the Universal Treatment System, at least for high molecular weight active ingredients, to achieve a treated water that can be reused in the facility. It is less clear whether the concentrated waste created by either of these treatment steps can be recovered for its product value. The samples taken from the concentrate fraction show high concentrations of the active ingredients, however, there are also high concentrations of sodium, calcium and total dissolved solids which could prevent the recoverability of these wastes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A third treatability study was performed to support rulemaking for both the PFPR and pesticide manufacturing. This study examined wastewater containing pyrethrins to determine their treatability by hydrolysis and activated carbon. Wastewater collected from a pyrethrin manufacturer was tested under varying hydrolysis conditions of temperature and pH. Carbon isotherms were also developed for this wastewater.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The combined pyrethrins concentration in the untreated wastewater was initially 110 mg/L. Hydrolysis tests performed at 60  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;C and pH values of 2 and 12 were used to determine the hydrolysis rates (half-life values) of the pyrethrins. Pyrethrins hydrolyzed rapidly at pH 12, exhibiting a half-life of 1.2 hours. Pyrethrins hydrolyses at pH 2 were much slower, with a calculated half-life of 77 hours.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Six carbon dosages were also tested to determine adsorption characteristics of pyrethrins. At a 10 gallon per minute flow rate, the carbon column would have a service life of 11.4 days for combined pyrethrins at 110 mg/L initial concentration indicating that pyrethrins are adsorbed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 6. Data Transfers From Pesticide Manufacturing Subcategories and Other Sources  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Agency has developed an active ingredient treatability dataset, based on full-scale treatment system data, treatability study information, and data transfers, that show that all of the 272 active ingredients included in the survey are amenable to one or more of the treatment technologies that are included in the Universal Treatment System, which EPA is identifying as BAT for purposes of today's proposed pretreatment standards for existing sources (see PSES discussion below).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA transferred the treatability data from the following sources, listed in order of preference.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Pesticides manufacturing active ingredient or active ingredient group BAT limitations development data. The data are transferred from the manufacturing data base to support BAT limitations if the treatment is based on activated carbon adsorption, chemical oxidation, hydrolysis, a combination of these technologies, or precipitation of organo-metallic active ingredients or active ingredient groups.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) EPA bench-scale treatability study reports.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

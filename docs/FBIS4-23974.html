			<p>French   Intervention in Rwanda   <F P=102> AB2006150094 Paris AFP in French 0944 GMT 20 Jun 94 </F> <F P=103> AB2006150094 </F> <F P=104>  Paris AFP </F> <F P=105>  French </F> BFN     [Text] Kinshasa, 20 Jun (AFP) -- The Union for Democracy  and Social Progress [UDPS], the main radical opposition party  led by Etienne Tshisekedi, today strongly criticized any French  intervention in Rwanda. In a communique published by the  radical opposition media, UDPS said the humanitarian reasons put  forward by France are "a mere pretext." "In reality," the  communique said, "the French, after realizing that their  protege, the late President Habyarimana's militia, which was  armed and trained by them, is losing ground, are shamelessly  preparing to give them a hand in order to recapture lost ground  and to counterattack the democratic forces which are progressing  in central Africa."    The UDPS added that France is supporting "dictatorships in  Africa," and declared that it will hold responsible "before  history, any Zairian who helps in undertaking any act of  aggression against Rwanda from Zairian territory."    The UDPS concluded by saying that any French intervention in  Rwanda outside the United Nations "would constitute a deliberate  provocation against the progressive and democratic forces of  central Africa."</p>

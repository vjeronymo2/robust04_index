			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / Pay fall lends hope for training THE PAY of young adults aged between 18 and 20 has fallen sharply as a proportion of adult wages since 1979, according to data collected by the Low Pay Unit, the research group. The fall, from 61 per cent of adult wages to 53 per cent, has been greeted by some economists and employers as an important step towards increasing the number of training places for young people. Ms Vivien Marshall, head of education and training at the Engineering Employers Federation, said: 'This is an encouraging sign, which could lead to more, and better-quality, training places.' She said there was a widely accepted correlation between young people's pay and the training opportunities employers offered. Youth pay in Germany used to be almost half the UK rate, which was one reason for some German employers overtraining, to the benefit of the economy as a whole, she added. The Low Pay Unit, which backs moves to restore income support for people aged 16 to 19, cut in 1988, also found that pay for those aged 16 and 17 had fallen from 43 per cent of adult pay in 1979 to 33 per cent.

			<p><P> February 8, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LULAC DINNER TO HONOR EZELL ANGERS SANTA ANA CHAPTER  </P> <P> Harold Ezell, the top immigration official in the West, may have gained scores  of new Latino friends with his sombrero-toting support of the amnesty program  last year. But he probably could not find too many amigos within the League of  United Latin American Citizens -- or LULAC -- some of whose members have been  calling for Ezell's ouster.  </P> <P> Unless, that is, the western regional commissioner of the U.S. Immigration and  Naturalization Service happens to be in Bellflower, whose local LULAC council  is hosting a reception honoring him for "outstanding service in 'bridging the  gap' between the Hispanic community and the INS," according to a council  statement.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Location Sparks Anger  </P> <P> The Bellflower LULAC council's hosting of the event would be enough to rankle  Orange County LULAC leaders, who are still incensed over the INS's apprehension  last year of several undocumented aliens inside a church in the city of Orange,  and by continued roundups of casual laborers on street corners.  </P> <P> But what has them even more outraged is that the event honoring Ezell will be  held in a restaurant in Costa Mesa, on the fringe of territory covered by the  Santa Ana LULAC council, the most outspokenly hostile to Ezell of the nine  LULAC councils in Orange County.  </P> <P> Zeke Hernandez, president of the Santa Ana council, fired off a letter to state  LULAC leaders, asking that they coordinate action against the reception and the  Bellflower group.  </P> <P> "Our community cannot be led to believe that LULAC has jumped into bed with  Ezell and his 'tigers,' " Hernandez said in the letter. "Have we not learned  our lessons from previous experiences that the INS has mistreated many of our  respectable Hispanic brothers and sisters?"  </P> <P> Margaret Pacheco, president of the Bellflower LULAC council, has a different  view of the group's relationship with Ezell.  </P> <P> "He's been very helpful and instrumental in helping the undocumented to become  legal," Pacheco said. "I believe he's gone beyond the call of duty in  disseminating information and encouraging the people to apply and stay in the  process until they become permanent residents."  </P> <P> Ezell was traveling Tuesday and could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Worked With INS  </P> <P> The Bellflower LULAC council worked with the immigration agency in publicizing  the amnesty program, conducting weekend fairs where applicants could get help  in filling out their papers and receiving low-cost medical examinations,  Pacheco said. And while other LULAC councils may have been critical of the  Bellflower group for cooperating so closely with the INS, Pacheco said, her  group now wants to show its thanks to Ezell and his staff for their help.  </P> <P> "A lot of times, the head man gets bypassed," Pacheco said. "Harold Ezell is  the man who did work with us."  </P> <P> So why not hold the honorary reception in Bellflower and avoid ruffling the  feathers of other LULAC members?  </P> <P> "There is not very much around here where we could hold it," Pacheco said. So  the $25-per-person reception is scheduled for Feb. 16 at the El Torito Grill on  Anton Boulevard in Costa Mesa. Actor John Gavin, former U.S. ambassador to  Mexico, will be guest speaker.  </P> <P> Richard Jacques, a member of the Bellflower council, said the event is  co-sponsored by the LULAC Community Education Group, an organization of LULAC  members statewide that is offering English classes to amnesty applicants under  Phase 2 of the amnesty program.  </P> <P> The group charges $250 for the course, and it obtained certification from the  INS to offer the classes, Jacques said.  </P> <P> "We're doing this to promote a positive working relationship with the INS," he  said. "I would just ask the people in LULAC, those other people out there, what  did they do to . . . bring these people into the mainstream? It's easy to throw  stones."  </P> <P> But Hernandez and other Santa Ana council members are not the only LULAC  members angered by the Bellflower group's initiative.  </P> <P> Anita Del Rio, LULAC's vice president for the Far West region, has recommended  that the group's national leadership expel former national vice president Jose  Pacheco -- Margaret Pacheco's husband and the Bellflower council's liaison to  the INS -- from the League for improper conduct.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Not Sanctioned'  </P> <P> "The function is not a sanctioned league activity," Del Rio said, referring to  the action of the Bellflower council. "It (the invitation) says the league is  honoring him, and it's not."  </P> <P> LULAC's national president, Jose Garcia de Lara, said the executive committee  has not yet formally considered its response to the Bellflower council's  action. But he said: "We have condemned Harold Ezell, and we're asking for him  to be fired, certainly not reappointed. . . . Certainly we don't endorse this  activity."  </P> <P> Rose Jurado, LULAC's Orange County district director, said she sent a letter on  Monday to the Bellflower group, asking them to change their plans. But Margaret  Pacheco said that no other LULAC leaders had contacted her so far about  canceling or moving the event to another location.  </P> <P> "You expect that (opposition) . . . but we haven't heard anything at all," she  said.  </P> <P> Santa Ana council president Hernandez said his group, along with other  community members, would picket the event if it goes ahead as scheduled.  </P> <P> "It's tough to air your laundry out in public, but you've got to air it out if  you want clean laundry," he said.  </P></p>

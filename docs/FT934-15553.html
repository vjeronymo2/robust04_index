			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / Survey of Finland: A hard slog lies ahead - The economy should return to growth next year after a deep depression. But unemployment will stay high for the rest of the decade Weary after three years of deep recession and wary of what may still occur in neighbouring Russia, Finland is looking to the year ahead to establish a recovery in the economy and to plot the political path it will follow in the second half of the decade. Thanks to a resurgence in exports, the economy is set to return to growth in 1994 after a traumatic depression. National output has shrunk by fully 10 per cent since the turn of the decade and unemployment has mounted from below 5 per cent of the workforce to 20 per cent in a country that in the 1980s had become one of Europe's most affluent societies. On the strategic front, Finns watched - with more anxiety than most - the events unfolding across their long border with Russia last week; they will be hoping that 1994 will see President Boris Yeltsin entrench democratic and economic stability in the neighbour that has always loomed ominously over Finland's eastern shoulder. More than that, the governing centre-right coalition of Mr Esko Aho, the prime minister, as well as the Social Democratic opposition, intend that next year will see a successful outcome to Helsinki's negotiations for membership of the European Community, which they regard as an essential economic and political anchor for Finland in the post-cold war world. The beginning of the year will also bring a change of national leadership. Elections in January for a successor to President Mauno Koivisto will for the first time be held by universal suffrage, adding political weight to the office of head of state. The strong favourite is Mr Martti Ahtisaari, candidate of the Social Democrats and prominent United Nations diplomat, who enthusiastically advocates Finnish membership of the EC. But although the outlook is brighter, many obstacles remain which suggest that Finland still faces a hard slog to restore the prosperity and confidence it enjoyed in the 1980s. Already, the government has had to revise downwards its earlier projections of 3 per cent growth next year. The weaker than expected condition of key export markets, particularly Sweden and Germany, and the persistence of low demand and high savings ratios in the domestic economy have combined to push down official growth estimates for 1994 to around 1 per cent, a level which will barely make a dent on unemployment. Mr Aho's government is also constrained by a high budget deficit - running at around 10 per cent of gross domestic product - and a concern to rein in a foreign debt which grew rapidly over the past three years to reach 50 per cent of GDP. Progress has been made, with public spending pegged in real terms at 1991 levels and a current account surplus anticipated next year thanks to the recovery in exports. But the high cost of unemployment payments and the heavy costs of rescuing the loss-ridden banking system from collapse have slowed the process of righting the imbalance in the public finances and squeezed out any possibility of a significant fiscal stimulus for the economy. 'We have a special interest to stimulate the domestic economy,' Mr Aho said in an interview with the FT. 'But the problem is that there are very tight limits for stimulation. The main way to stimulate the economy is to push interest rates downwards and keep them down.' Interest rates are at their lowest level for decades, steadily reduced since the markka was floated in September last year and quickly lost more than 25 per cent of its value. But recovery in investment has been slow to appear as companies and private individuals prefer to play down the debts they still carry from the carefree days of the 1980s. The uncomfortable reality is that, even under the most optimistic projections, unemployment in Finland is set to remain above 10 per cent for the rest of the decade. Mr Aho's Centre party and his conservative coalition partners see more far-reaching structural reforms as a way to engender more long-term growth. But there is still considerable resistance to the notion of wholesale changes in Finland's highly-developed welfare and social systems. Attempts, for example, to lower minimum wages for young workers have been largely blocked by the labour unions. A key element in the government's long-term economic strategy for Finland lies in joining the EC. Helsinki has already signed up to join the European Economic Area, the open market agreement between the Community and the countries of the European Free Trade Association. But, like the governments in neighbouring Norway and Sweden, Finland wants to advance to full membership to bring the economy fully within the EC fortress, not least to ensure that Finnish investment does not migrate, and to help attract inward investment. The desire for EC membership extends well beyond the economic argument, however. It is seen in Helsinki as an important strategic repositioning of the country after the end of the cold war. Throughout the east-west confrontation after the second world war, Finland, which established its independence from Russian rule only in 1917, steered a course of neutrality, which was respected by the US and the Soviet Union alike. Lucrative trade agreements with the latter were the basis for much of Finland's surge to prosperity - and a primary cause of recession when the Soviet Union collapsed. Now relationships with Russia are less certain. Initial fears of chaos across the border and, perhaps, floods of Russian refugees, have subsided, notwithstanding the dramatic events in Moscow this month. Finland has established strong political and trading ties with the newly-independent Baltic states, particularly Estonia, which lies less than 50 miles away across the Gulf of Finland. In a revitalised Baltic region, it sees St Petersburg, with its 9m population, as a lucrative potential market. But Helsinki is nevertheless looking to membership of the EC - and participation in the Community's evolving political and security structures  -as its strategic anchor in the new order and an insurance policy against future instability in Russia. By no means all Finns are enthusiastic about joining the EC, however. Although opinion is more favourable than in Norway and Sweden, polls still show a strong hostile minority. Opposition covers issues from the fear of rural communities that they will lose generous subsidies, to fears of a loss of Finland's freedom. Opinion divides within political parties, with Mr Aho's Centre party, for example, split on the issue. 'Finns are used to the idea that freedom and independence are one and the same thing and that anything which impinges on independence impinges on their freedom,' says Mr Kaakko Iloniemi, director of the Centre for Finnish Business and Policy Studies. The government has promised a referendum on the issue which will be held sometime late next year if the target of joining in 1995 is to be met. Much will depend on achieving an accession agreement in the negotiations now under way with Brussels that the government can 'sell' to the electorate as a good deal for Finland. Hence Mr Aho has adopted a tough negotiating stance, demanding EC subsidies for Finland's farmers and calling on the Community to accept the special needs of the Nordic region. 'They have to accept, in a way, new policies - a new approach - like they did when Portugal and Spain joined,' says Mr Aho. 'Then it was the southern approach. Now it is a question of the northern approach.' The campaign to win support for Finland's EC membership should receive a boost in January when Mr Ahtisaari is expected to win the presidency. He, more than any of his eight opponents for the post, espouses the cause and, indeed, he is a potent symbol of an active Finnish role internationally. Finnish presidents have tended to play a less active political role than the constitutional powers of the office allow, but Mr Ahtisaari has signalled that he intends to take the lead in foreign policy that the constitution affords. His fame is built chiefly on his role as a UN envoy - notably heading the UN's operation overseeing Namibia's transition to independence. His popularity at home has undoubtedly been enhanced by the fact that he is not associated with the disasters that have overtaken the country in the past few years. His voice could be vital in cementing opinion in favour of EC membership.</p>

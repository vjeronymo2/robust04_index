			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Boris Zelada at the Legislative Assembly in San </F> Salvador; from the "YSU Radio News" newscast]    [Text] President Alfredo Cristiani said Wednesday that the  departure of Augusto Ramirez Ocampo as UN Observers for El  Salvador [Onusal] chief scheduled for 31 March is part of the  normal Onusal changeover. Within this context, he ruled out  that the change will in any way affect the mission since someone  else will be named to replace him, as occurred following the  departure of Igbal Riza, the first person to head Onusal when it  began its mission.    [Begin recording] [Cristiani] First, or at least the  information we have is that the contract with Mr. Ocampo was for  one year. He had said earlier he wanted to return to Colombia  to continue to participate in some capacity in Colombia's  political life. In this regard, this is nothing more than an  administrative change, and, in that respect, I do not see that  this is something against Ramirez, since he has chosen not to  remain here for personal reasons.    Second, talking about these changes, one took place already  without affecting the efforts to continue implementing the peace  agreements. That was when Ambassador Igbal Riza was replaced by  Ambassador Ramirez Ocampo. We do not feel this change has an  adverse impact on the implementation of those agreements that  involve processes such as the transfer of land and the lack of  public security. [as heard]    [Unidentified reporter] [Question indistinct]    [Cristiani] Not true. [end recording] Cristiani also flatly  rejected remarks by Francisco Lima, accusing him of being  personally responsible for the corruption in state enterprises.  He said the charges are so groundless that he will not even  file a suit against Lima. To end, the president said he was  satisfied with the development of the electoral process that  will end on 20 March. He added that the elections are  contributing to the overall development of the democratic  process in El Salvador. Cristiani made these remarks after he  presided over a solemn session held this morning in the  Legislative Assembly. During this session the city of Santa Ana  was declared a heroic city owing to the developments that took  place there in 1894 during the revolution that led to the  ousting of General Carlos Erzeta. In addition, David Escobar  Galido was declared El Salvador's most distinguished son.</p>

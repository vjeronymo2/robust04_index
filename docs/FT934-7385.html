			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Prolonged drought delays sowing of Greek winter wheat GREEK FARMERS have had to postpone sowing winter wheat this autumn, because of a severe drought affecting much of the country. The first rainfall in six months in Thessaly, the main grain-producing region, came last week but was not enough to soften the ground for sowing. Hard wheat output in Greece averages about 1.4m tonnes yearly, of which 80 per cent is exported. This year's crop amounted to only 900,000 tonnes, even though farmers in drought-stricken districts resorted to irrigating the wheat crop. Soft wheat output fell to 900,000 tonnes, compared with 1.9m tonnes last year. However, exports have not been affected as durum wheat reserves are high after after a bumper harvest in 1992, amounting to 1.8m tonnes. Production of maize, which relies on intensive irrigation to achieve adequate yields, dropped by 25 per cent to about 1m tonnes this year. 'It's clear that after three dry winters in the past five years, reserves of ground water are getting dangerously low,' said Mr Paris Diamandouros of Diamandouros Brothers, a leading grain exporter. Greece's main winter crops, olives and citrus, will also be affected by the drought. The agriculture ministry's initial estimates suggest that yields will be down by 20 and 25 per cent respectively, unless rainfall is heavy over the next month. The ministry has not yet calculated the cost of the drought, but independent analysts reckon it will amount to at least Dollars 400m in lost production. Citrus output could fall to about 800,000 tonnes, according to early estimates from growers. Production of olive oil is not likely to exceed 220,000 tonnes this season, down from 280,000 tonnes last year. While growers in western Greece, where rainfall has been close to normal levels, forecast an average crop, production is forecast to drop sharply in other olive-growing regions. Among the worst-affected is the island of Mytilene, where output is forecast at 6,000 tonnes, compared with with 30,000 tonnes in the 1992-93 season. On Crete, a 25 per cent drop in precipitation this year, means that farmers in mountainous districts, where trees cannot be irrigated, could lose most of their crop. Mr Stelios Papadakis, whose olive trees are in the foothills of Mount Ida, said: 'The fruit is so shrivelled, it may not be worth paying the cost of picking this winter'. However, olive oil prices, now about Dr750 (Dollars 3) a kilogram, are not likely to not rise sharply. Some 80,000 tonnes of oil is being stored by co-operatives around Greece, while local consumption of olive oil has been declining at a rate of about 4 per cent a year, according to Elaiourgiki, the state-controlled marketing co-operative.</p>

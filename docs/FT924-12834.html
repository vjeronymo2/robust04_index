			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / UK Gilts: Surprise rate cut provides boost across yield curve GILT-edged securities were among the main beneficiaries of the surprise cut in base rates, announced by the UK government on Friday. The reduction in base rates from 9 per cent to 8 per cent led to a rise in prices across the yield curve for most classes of gilts, adding to the momentum that has built up in the market over the past two weeks. In that time, the difference between the yields for 10-year gilts and their equivalent French and German bonds have narrowed considerably, indicating heightened investor interest in the UK securities. That perception has followed from a stream of gloomy news about mounting job losses and stagnant demand and production in the UK, adding to indications that the recession will last until well into 1993. In this environment, the cut in UK interest rates added to demand for gilts at the short end of the yield curve. This was on the grounds that further cuts in borrowing conditions can be expected by the end of the year to get the flat economy moving again. Somewhat more surprising was Friday's half-point increase in prices for long-dated gilts, especially as the pound wobbled after the base rate cut to close on Friday night down 1 1/2 pfennigs on the day at just below DM2.45. The longer-dated instruments were to some degree helped by the extra demand unleashed for the shorter maturing variety. But they also benefited from indications that, even with further cuts in credit rates, inflation pressures will remain weak. Accordingly, the benchmark 8 3/4 per cent Treasury bond due in 1997 gained more than 2 points on the week to close on Friday night at nearly 104 for a yield of 7.76 per cent. This latter figure was about half a percentage point lower than a week previously. At the long end of the yield curve, the 9 per cent stock maturing in 2012 saw an increase in price of nearly 1 1/2 points, closing on Friday at nearly 99 1/2 for a reduction in yield on the week of about 20 basis points - one-fifth of a percentage point. The yield spreads between UK bonds and other countries' have narrowed dramatically. Two weeks ago, the difference between the yields on 10-year gilts and German bunds was 196 basis points while it is now about 140 basis points. Similarly, the difference for UK and 10-year French bonds has come down from 76 basis points to 38 basis points. In both cases, the yield gap is the lowest for several months. On Friday, the Bank of England issued Pounds 400m of index-linked gilts, available from today, which are designed to appeal to investors worried about the onset of inflationary pressures. These bonds are in three tranches: Pounds 100m of 2 1/2 per cent securities due 2001; Pounds 150m of 2 per cent bonds maturing 2006; and Pounds 150m of 2 1/2 per cent stock expiring 2016. The bank set the certified price for the 2 1/2 per cent Treasury stock due 2001 at 155 5/8 , the 2 per cent bond due 2006 at 155 1/2 and the 2 1/2 gilt due in 2016 at 129. However, countering concerns about inflation were government figures last week showing the underlying increase in average earnings in the year to August was 5.75 per cent compared with 6 per cent in the year to July, the lowest rate of increase for 25 years.</p>

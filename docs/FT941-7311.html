			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / People: Private Finance panel Hugh Jenkins, the Prudential's investment supremo, and John Walmsley, the former finance director of Enterprise Oil, have joined Sir Alastair Morton's government-sponsored Private Finance working group set up last year to coax private capital into public sector projects. Jenkins is the latest recruit to Sir Alastair's 15-strong panel of business leaders and senior civil servants and Walmsley, an old friend of Sir Alastair, is in charge of assembling a full-time executive support staff for the Private Finance Panel, as it is now called. The members of the executive, which is working out of Enterprise Oil's Trafalgar Square headquarters, have been mainly drawn from city firms and are as follows: Jason Fox (Herbert Smith), Dominic Hollamby (Arthur Andersen), Douglas Hogg (Eurotunnel), Nigel Middleton (Price Waterhouse), Luke Talbutt (Freshfields) and Barry Williams (Treasury).

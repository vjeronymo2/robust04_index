			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / Russians struggle to control budget deficit RUSSIA'S budget deficit will be around 10 per cent of gross national product in the first quarter of this year, against a government target of 1 per cent, officials have told the cabinet, according to the daily newspaper Izvestia. Efforts by Mr Yegor Gaidar, the deputy prime minister and finance minister, to reduce the deficit have been hampered by demands in parliament for higher welfare spending and lower taxes. However, Mr Gaidar now seems ready to resist pressure from parliament, said Izvestia. The cabinet is said to be about to reinstate full value added tax of 28 per cent on food. Rates had been cut, or abolished, by the Russian parliamentary praesidium. The cabinet is expected to cut defence and capital spending further. It has already been heavily cut from last year's levels. The planned defence spending is expected to be reduced to 6 per cent of GNP - a fall of more than half of the estimated defence spending during Soviet days. A dramatic fall in exports and the loss of export tax revenues was the main reason for the worsening deficit, according to the report of Mr Vassily Barchuk, deputy finance minister, to the cabinet. The forecasts showed no bright spot in any part of the economy, with further rapid falls in all areas of production. Oil output is expected to fall this year by 14 per cent from last year's depleted levels; iron and steel production by 15 per cent; chemicals by 16 per cent and food products by 18 per cent. Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, a bitter opponent of Mr Gaidar, yesterday again called for a new prime minister and a change of government. He mocked the economic reformers, saying they were using the word 'macroeconomy' as a kind of talisman, and were indifferent to the large falls in output. Restructuring of industry to make it more competitive - often the only silver lining in a recession - had failed to materialise, the Izvestia report said. Another official has forecast that Russia will be unable to pay off its external debt, of between Dollars 70bn and Dollars 80bn - because it had been loaded with the debt of former Soviet republics who could not or would not pay their share. Mr Yuri Gromushkin, adviser to the minister of foreign economic relations, added, however, that 'we cannot fully pay off all the external debt even as far as Russia is concerned'.</p>

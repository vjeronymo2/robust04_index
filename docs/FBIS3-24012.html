Who Is Next?"]    [Text] The situation developing in the Crimea puts  the question to Kiev point-blank: What is to be done, since  television remains the last bridge linking Kiev and  Simferopol?    On 18 February the president of Crimea, Yuriy Meshkov,  suggested that the president of the Krym [Crimea] Television and  Radio Company, Valeriy Astakhov, go into "voluntary-compulsory"  resignation, explaining this only by saying that it is unlikely  they can work together successfully. Although Yuriy  Aleksandrovich himself seems to have no complaints against  Valeriy Nikolayevich.    Maybe he does not, but then among those who do are some  people's deputies who hold positions in the RDK [expansion  unknown] and even the chairman of the fairly well known  association "Impeks-55 Krym", Valeriy Averkin himself, who  played a very effective role in shaping Yu. Meshkov as a  politician in the first stages of his giddy career. But today  Mr. Averkin, who has become involved in publishing activity, is  already trying to influence the shaping of public opinion among  all the Crimean petty bourgeoisie. In MESHCHANSKAYA GAZETA,  which he owns, V. Averkin on 16 February advised the government  how to "spank" the president of the television and radio  company, V. Astakhov, whom he has always disliked, you see, and  now, it is becoming clear, simply can no longer stand because of  the pro-Rukh spirit on the screen. "Crimea television," the  chief petty bourgeois of Crimea categorically alleges, "in its  present form is a slap in the face to Russian-speaking Crimeans,  regardless of their nationality... And it will be so until," V.  Averkin stresses, "Mr. Meshkov begins to fulfill his  pre-election promises, including those concerning television."    As is evident, he has already begun. But this "beginning"  immediately raised some questions. First, is it reasonable to  change the leader of the most popular and influential  information medium at the height of the pre-election campaign?  Secondly, how is it that the president of the teleradio company  of Crimea, which is a part of Gosteleradio Ukrainy [State  Television and Radio of Ukraine] and is financed from the state  budget, works under a contract with this organization which will  not terminate for 3 years? Thirdly, is putting the question in  that way proper when today there is no legal mechanism to allow  the president of Crimea to decide it on his own? The Supreme  Soviet now has the deciding word; I hope it will be guided not  by personal sympathies and antipathies, but by the norms of laws.    Valeriy Astakhov refused to accept Yuriy Meshkov's  suggestion  and intends to defend his rights in accordance with the law.    The Crimean branch of the Helsinki Civil Assembly was the  first to defend the rights of the journalist. The Assembly's  announcement says, among other things, that such a development  of events at the height of the election campaign for the  parliaments of Crimea and Ukraine opens up the way for political  censorship in Crimea and to the expulsion from television and  radio of journalists who have an independent opinion.    Out of fairness, I must say that it was precisely when V.  Astakhov became the head of the television and radio company  that it became possible to express various points of view,  including ones which differed from the official point of view.  With Astakhov's support, national editorial desks were set up  and are operating: Crimean-Tatar, Armenian, Greek, and  Bulgarian, plus the Si-Ay interethnic information service which  works in four languages, and the new channels. This enabled  television broadcasting to be increased from 6 hours a week to  36.    Even now the pressure of the Rossiya Bloc is appreciable; it  is not hiding its desire to obtain an absolute majority in the  Crimean parliament and realize its main task--to join the  peninsula to Russia. The arrival of a new leadership in  television will undoubtedly make this majority overwhelming. The  situation taking shape puts this question point-blank to  official Kiev too: Television in Crimea remains essentially the  last bridge linking Kiev and Simferopol, since the Ukrainian  newspapers have been reaching Crimea irregularly and very late  for a long time now. Incidentally, this is unlike the example of  the Russian newspapers, which appear in subscribers' boxes and  at kiosks on the day that the papers come out.</p>

At a conference in Budapest, EU Agriculture Commissioner  Rene  Steichen warned that excessive price subsidies led to expensive  over-production, as it had in West Europe. A text of his speech  was made available here.    Steichen said the Union was ready to support agricultural  reform in East Europe, but also intended to protect EU farmers  against floods of cheap agricultural imports from the region.</p>

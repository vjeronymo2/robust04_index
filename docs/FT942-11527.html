			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / S Africa parties seek votes deal South Africa's main political parties were negotiating a share-out of disputed votes yesterday from the country's first all-race elections, after the Independent Electoral Commission in effect abandoned a conventional tally for political expediency. IEC officials said privately that a deal had been struck at regional level between the African National Congress and the rival Inkatha Freedom party in Natal, the most heavily disputed province, to ensure that Inkatha emerges as the largest party there. But the leadership of the ANC, the second largest party in Natal and overall winner of the general election, had yet to endorse the agreement. The moves came as electoral officials early today ended a temporary halt to the release of results, announcing that the ANC had won 64.9 per cent of the votes with 15m counted out of the total of 23m. This brought the party close to the 66 per cent threshold which would allow it unilaterally to change the constitution. The IEC, charged under the law with conducting elections and pronouncing on their integrity, made clear it would endorse any agreement reached among political parties, irrespective of voting totals. Mr Justice Johann Kriegler, the embattled IEC chairman, said the commission 'would certainly not stand in the way' of parties resolving disputes among themselves. Asked whether the IEC ought not to judge disputes independently in determining whether to endorse the elections, Judge Kriegler replied: 'If the objector and the objectee come to terms, that is universally accepted as legitimate in the political game . . . Let's not get overly squeamish.' Judge Kriegler said he believed the presidential inauguration could take place on schedule next Tuesday.

			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / Menem wins backing for UN force Argentina's proposal to establish a United Nations force to be deployed during natural disasters will be debated in the General Assembly today and should be 'unanimously approved,' according to Mr James Cheek, US ambassador in Buenos Aires. Mr Cheek, speaking after talks between Mr William Perry, US defence secretary, and Mr Oscar Camilion, his Argentine counterpart, said the resolution, strongly supported by the US, already enjoyed the backing of 50 national co-sponsors. Argentina's proposal would direct the General Assembly to study the establishment of a force, to be recognised by its 'white helmets,' and dedicated to alleviating the effects of natural disasters such as famine and floods and to come forward with concrete proposals in the next few months. Mr Perry, on a visit to Brazil and Argentina, said he had discussed the resolution with President Carlos Menem, including a proposal to establish a centre in Argentina to train the force. Acceptance of the initiative would be a public-relations coup for Mr Menem whose administration has done much to re-establish its international credentials and has allied itself more closely with US foreign policy than almost any other Latin American state. Argentina is virtually alone, for example, in supporting the US embargo against Cuba. It also backed the invasion of Haiti and, said Mr Camilion, was willing to send a battalion of 300 peacekeepers to the island in the next few months. Mr Perry praised Argentina for its new approach, which contrasts strongly with its history of non-alignment, especially for its deployment of troops in UN peacekeeping missions in such regions as Cyprus, Mozambique and Croatia. Argentina's immediate reward will be the signing next month of a contract with Lockheed to run the state-owned Aerea Material Cordoba aircraft factory where 18 of the 36 A-4M Skyhawks purchased by Argentina from the US earlier this year will be upgraded. Argentina is expected to pay Dollars 250m-Dollars 400m for the aircraft, including the cost of renovation. Mr Camilion said he hoped that the input of US expertise could transform the Cordoba plant into a regional repair centre for civil and military aircraft.</p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Beirut AL-ANWAR in Arabic on 6 May on  pages 1 and 15 carries a 700-word report which includes the  "text" of a letter allegedly sent to Qatari Amir Khalifah  Bin-Hamad Al Thani by his brother Shaykh Muhammad Bin-Hamad Al  Thani, a former education minister. The letter urges the  dismissal of Qatari Foreign Minister Hamad Bin-Jasim Al Thani  for his "irresponsible" policies.    The letter points to the "negative consequences" of the  foreign minister's meeting with his Israeli counterpart and to  the continuing Arab media criticism of the "sudden change" in  Qatar's foreign policy, "which has always been known for its  courageous support for Arab causes in general and the  Palestinian cause in particular."    Noting in his letter that the amir "always has concern for  the higher interests of the country and the national interests  of the Arab and Islamic nation," Shaykh Al Thani says: "With his  reckless statements and irresponsible acts that demonstrate  great vanity and arrogance, the foreign minister has destroyed  Qatar's foreign policy and been a dismal failure, for which he  deserves questioning and dismissal." The letter also accuses  the minister of destroying the domestic economy as he worked "to  serve his personal interests, disregarding the nation's economic  interests."    The report goes on to say the letter, "which reveals a  serious split in the royal family" is the second of its kind  since the beginning of the year. It was distributed among some  circles in Qatar and the other Gulf Cooperation Council  countries when the country was hosting the multilateral talks on  Middle East disarmament on 2-3 May, in which Israel  participated. It says the first letter, in which Shaykh Al  Thani "condemned the foreign minister's meetings with Israeli  ministers and officials at the United Nations and in London,"  was sent to Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad and to Arab and  foreign embassies in Doha.</p>

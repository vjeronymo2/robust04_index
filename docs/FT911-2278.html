			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / Management: Management abstracts Accounting standards and the judiciary. G W Radcliffe in Accounting and Business Research (UK), Autumn 90 (8 pages) Examines UK legal cases for evidence that the judiciary attaches importance to Standard Statements of Accounting Practice; finds that it pays attention  -rather than attach importance - to SSAPs, but where SSAPs and statute diverge, choose to rely on statute. ***** Contrarian marketing. A J Magrath in Across the Board (US), Oct 90 (5 pages) Defines contrarian marketing as doing the opposite to conventional marketing wisdom, quoting the example of Body Shop International, the UK cosmetics group, which sells only through its own franchise outlets, uses minimal packaging and does not advertise, educating customers rather than persuading them. Offers other examples, mainly from the US, in industries as diverse as window manufacture and theatre ownership, and examines the qualities that contrarian marketers should possess. ***** The new management: institutions for the information age. W E Halal in Business in the Contemporary World (US), Winter 90 (14 pages) Addresses the nature of management as society and business shifts from an industrial to an information age; describes features of 'new management' - smart growth, internal markets, participative leadership, multiple goals, and strategic management. Wonders why, if there are such advantages from new management, so many organisations stick to a traditional, bureaucratic model; sees this lying in obstacles such as managers' unwillingness to yield control (as they perceive it), yet the real situation to aim at is a mix of freedom and control. Considers new management in social institutions - government, medicine, education. ***** Ethical values of individuals at different levels in an organisation. J R Harris in Journal of Business Ethics (Netherlands), Sep 90 (10 pages) Presents a study of individuals in the same firm: the objectives of the study were - inter alia - to determine if significant differences existed at different levels; and whether the organisation's culture affected values. Warns against generalising results, but concludes - inter alia - that top management may be less tolerant of fraudulent behaviour and that the longer an individual is with a company the less tolerant he or she becomes. Appends the business practice questionnaire used in the study; it contains 15 scenarios against which approval or disapproval is ranked. ***** Projects in syndicate. Business Executive (UK), Mar/Apr 90 (2 pages) Presents ideas of how to use syndicate projects to get trainees to draw upon their own experience and knowledge in small groups that report back. These abstracts are condensed from the abstracting journals published by Anbar Management Publications. Licensed copies of the original articles may be obtained at a cost of Pounds 5.75 each (including VAT and p+p; cash with order) from Anbar, 62 Toller Lane, Bradford, West Yorkshire BD8 9BY.</p>

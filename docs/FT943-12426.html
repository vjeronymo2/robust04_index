			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / Emerging Markets: Egyptian market set to expand Egypt's illiquid stock market is in for a relative bonanza, writes Mark Nicholson in Cairo. Some five public sector companies are set to float shares by the end of the year under the government's privatisation programme  -moves which should more than double the number of actively traded stocks on the exchange. Although Cairo's bourse lists 674 companies, only 20 or so trade actively and only two or three, including Suez Cement and Commercial International Bank, resemble anything like 'alpha' stocks. But next month - the launch date remains to be set - Ameriya Cement Company should join this elite. The government Holding Company for Metallurgical Industries is to float 4m of Ameriya's 20m shares in an issue which local brokers say is already oversubscribed by orders from local investors and international emerging market funds. Shares will be floated in two tranches: the first 2m shares, open only to individual investors with a cap of 5,000 shares per applicant; and the second 2m open to institutional investors some six months later. A further 2m shares will be sold to the company's Employee Share Ownership Association. Banque Misr, the bank handling the sale, has not announced a price, but brokers expect EPounds 27 a share (Dollars 8). Management of Ameriya, regarded as one of Egypt's most efficient public sector companies, has already promised to pay a EPounds 3 per share dividend in December based on earnings so far this fiscal year. One of Egypt's newest broking companies says it already has 5m orders for the stock, most from overseas emerging market funds.</p>

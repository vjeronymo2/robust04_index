			<p><P> April 28, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> VICTIM OF GANG ATTACK DEVELOPS PNEUMONIA  </P> <P> The comatose victim of a Central Park attack has developed pneumonia and her  "life hangs by a thread," doctors said Thursday.  </P> <P> "One of the problems we had worried about, a small focus of pneumonia in the  right lower lung, developed," said Dr. Robert Kurtz, assistant chief of surgery  at Metropolitan Hospital.  </P> <P> As a precaution, the woman, a Wall Street investment banker, was put back on a  respirator. She has remained in a coma since she was brought to the hospital  following the savage gang rape involving at least nine attackers in Central  Park last week.  </P></p>

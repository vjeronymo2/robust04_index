			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / International Company News: Preussag holds ground as sales slip PREUSSAG, the German steel, trading, energy and metals group, which took over the Salzgitter state steel company at the end of 1989, continues to confound the sceptics and report 'satisfactory' prospects for the current year. The company intends to maintain its 1990-1991 dividend of DM10 per share this year, in spite of a downturn in sales of some 7 per cent in the first four months, said Mr Ernst Pieper, chairman. Group net profit in the last financial year, to September 30, reached DM425m (Dollars 254m) on sales of DM25.46bn, the company said, in excess of the DM400m forecast last December. Net profits on the first four months of the current financial year stand at DM130m, similar to the level in the same period one year ago. 'Individual units within the group face difficult economic conditions this year, but they have a good competitive position compared to other players in their markets,' according to the annual report. 'That is why we are optimistic about overall developments, and expect to generate another good result for the group and the parent in 1991-1992.' Mr Pieper said the sales figure of DM7.25bn in the first four months reflected lower prices for steel and non-ferrous metals. However, the diversification of the group had contributed to the relatively stable result. Last year the company benefited from the strong growth in the German economy. Badly-hit was the group's 51 per cent-owned subsidiary, Metaleurop SA, which registered a loss thanks to the 29 per cent fall in lead and zinc prices.</p>

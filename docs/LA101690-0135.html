			<p><P> October 16, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON;  </P> <P> VANDALISM AT YMCA ESTIMATED AT $10,000  </P> <P> Vandals broke into the Fullerton YMCA last weekend, smashing windows and  causing an estimated $10,000 in damage, authorities said.  </P> <P> The incident at 2000 Youth Way occurred either late Saturday night or early  Sunday morning, police said.  </P> <P> Vandals used rocks and heavy flower planters to smash windows at the building  and of vans used to pick up children for the Y's day-care program. YMCA sweat  shirts and food were reported stolen.  </P> <P> Police said investigators are treating the incident as a burglary and would not  say whether it was gang-related. The building is closed on the weekend and is  generally used by seniors.  </P> <P> "It was a total mess," said Tony Shuman, executive director of North County  YMCA. "There was so much broken glass that we had to hire a carpet cleaner to  get it all out." Shuman said coffee packets were also opened and scattered all  over the grounds.  </P> <P> Shuman said the YMCA alerted police a month ago about a group of youngsters  that gathers near the facility at night on weekends.  </P> <P> "We were getting a little concerned because when we opened on Monday, we would  find broken beer bottles in the parking lot," Shuman said, adding that the  police had even sent out a patrol car on Friday nights but found nothing.  </P> <P> Shuman said the vandalism will force the YMCA to keep a worker on duty during  weekend nights, and that will burden an already-strained budget.  </P> <P> "I really don't understand why people do things like this," Shuman said. "This  center is for everyone. It doesn't make any sense." ERIK HAMILTON  </P></p>

But before negotiations with Austria, Finland, Norway and  Sweden can be concluded, the Twelve's existing members must  decide how far they are prepared to see the political centre of  gravity shift, too.    The Union's Mediterranean members are worried that embracing  the four rich, and principally Protestant, northern states will  move the political agenda away from their own priorities.    Which gives Malta and Cyprus -- also queuing up for  membership -- an opportunity to argue that making them full  members soon would keep the current north-south balance more or  less intact.    Yet the Mediterraneans -- who count only two large  countries,  Italy and Spain, in their number -- could find the northern  newcomers allies when it comes to deciding the balance of power  between large and small countries.    Large countries have more votes in the Council of Ministers  than small ones -- a legacy of the old European Coal and Steel  Community, in which France, West Germany and Italy were not  prepared to be outvoted by Belgium, the Netherlands and  Luxembourg.    Yet with votes based only roughly on population size, the  minnows look overrepresented in terms of the ratio of votes to  population. Luxembourg's two votes mean one vote for every  200,000 of its citizens. Britain and France's 10 give them  roughly one vote per 5.8 million people.    It's a voting formula which has survived the successive  incorporation of new members and ensures that large countries  can't be outvoted in the Council by a motley alliance of  mini-states.    Even so, the way that votes are evaluated has changed. By  the 1980's, Brussels had almost ground to a halt. The  Community, hit by recession and a decision-making structure  requiring unanimity, was in the grip of Eurosclerosis. The  response was the 1987 Single Act.    This aimed to kick-start the EC by allowing binding  decisions  on a majority vote in a wide range of policy areas. Small  members were protected from intimidation by larger ones by a  system of weighted -- or "qualified" -- majority voting. Under  this procedure, it takes 54 of the Council's 76 votes (a  difference of 22) to get a qualified majority, so small  countries need only pool 23 votes to successfully block a move.    The compromise has worked well. To reach a qualified  majority, the Big Five need at least two small states on their  side. Alternatively, small countries need the support of three  heavyweights. Any combination represents roughly 70 percent of  the Union's population.    Still, each wave of new members into the EU means  readjusting  the balance of power. EU leaders agreed on the number of votes  for new members last month. Sweden and Austria will get four  each, with three apiece for Finland and Norway. But they have  still to agree on the formula for blocking minorities. If the  equation used to decide on votes is extended, eight of the  tiddlers -- representing less than one eighth of the combined  population -- would be able to block decisions affecting the  remaining seven eighths.    Karl Lamers, a German Christian Democrat, has proposed a  complex formula that would ensure decisions are taken by a  majority of member states which among them represent a majority  of the EU's citizens. A new category of "super-qualified"  majority could be introduced in areas now requiring unanimity  such as taxation and foreign policy.    A new formula could be agreed by EU leaders in Corfu in  June,  or at a special summit, possibly in March or April.    And yet any solution will be a stopgap. Germany -- the  biggest member state and, since unification the most grossly  under-represented per head of population -- may push for a  redistribution of votes at the Union's next round of  institutional reform in 1996.    There may be a redistribution of commissioners, too. Today,  the Big Five have two each and the rest -- including the four  new members -- one each. One suggestion is that the Big Five  each have a permanent seat in Brussels, while the minnows rotate  the remaining places.    The issue could be more complex if the Union brings in  micro-states Malta and Cyprus. Maltese diplomats have indicated  privately that their country may not take up its right to hold  the EU's rotating presidency, perhaps missing a turn at the  helm, as Portugal did.    Such a concession might alarm medium-sized members. For them  this would be a slippery slope, dangerously eroding their  comparative power against the big battalions.</p>

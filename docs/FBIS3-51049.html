			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Economic Report" column by Miriam Lage] </F>   [Text] In spite of inflation, 1993 was exceptional for the  Brazilian economy. Beside the increase in the GDP to 4.5  percent -- 10 percent of which corresponds to the industrial  sector -- the trade balance hit record levels. Although the  final figure will remain a little below the $15.5 billion  registered last year, exports and imports continued to increase,  generating a trade volume of over $60 billion.    This is a record figure never before achieved in our trade  balance. Thanks to exports, the unemployment rate is  diminishing in Brazil. Acting Industry, Commerce, and Tourism  Minister Ailton Barcellos Fernandes has said that for every  billion dollars worth of goods Brazil exports, 80,000 jobs are  generated. Given that exports have remained above an average of  $3 billion since last March, one can calculate the job openings  generated by our foreign trade.    The increase in imports, compared with $20.6 billion last  year, is not worrisome because a lot of machinery and equipment  has been purchased to make Brazilian industries more competitive  in the internationalization of the economy: Brazil is preparing  to face the greatest trade liberation in history, which is  scheduled for 1995 through the GATT agreement.    President Itamar Franco thus has something to celebrate: The  trade balance surplus increased by 10 percent. This is  fantastic if compared with the average 4-5 percent increase in  the rest of the world during 1993. Our exchange balance is one  of the four highest in the world, to which we may add our  enviable $26 billion exchange reserves, placing Brazil among the  top 10 hard currency reserves in the world.</p>

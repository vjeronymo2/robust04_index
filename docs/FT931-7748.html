			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Keeping tight hold of your title - In a Nutshell Many companies write a 'retention of title' clause into their terms of trade to allow them to retain ownership of goods even after they have been delivered. The aim is to increase their chance of getting their goods or money back if a customer goes bust. But do these clauses work when the goods are exported to another country? Baker &amp; McKenzie, a firm of solicitors, has produced a guide to the effectiveness of retention of title throughout Europe. Retention of Title in Sales Contracts within Europe explains that in some countries the clause must be registered to be valid while others place restrictions on the goods which can be covered.

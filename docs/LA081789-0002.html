			<p><P> August 17, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE RIGHT MAN FOR THE JOB  </P> <P> The appointment of a career National Park Service official as superintendent of  Yosemite National Park has, happily, squelched for now fears that politics  would be injected into the selection of administrators of the nation's two  oldest and most-revered national parks, Yosemite and Yellowstone. But that does  not mean the job facing 42-year-old Michael V. Finley will not require a leader  with a keen political sense. All of the divergent forces that come to bear on  the operation of the national parks converge on Yosemite, where years of study  and planning have failed to reconcile conflicts that sometimes seem to be  irreconcilable.  </P> <P> If anyone in the National Park Service is up to the job, it should be Finley.  He has gotten rave reviews during his three years as superintendent of  Everglades National Park, which is considered the most threatened in the park  system. "He seems to thrive on tough jobs. He's a real pro," said Paul C.  Pritchard, president of the National Parks and Conservation Assn. Finley may be  just the sort of person who is capable of developing creative methods of  handling the problems of Yosemite, particularly the tremendous visitor  pressures on Yosemite Valley.  </P> <P> Should that be the case, it will be because Finley has come up through the  ranks of the Park Service and is intimately familiar with the conflicts  involved in trying to achieve the park system's congressional mandate: to  preserve the natural features of the parks while also making them available for  the people's enjoyment. He knows how to deal with the concessionaires who run  the hotels and other money-making ventures in the parks, with the  environmentalists, and with the Park Service bureaucracy. And while he has had  a short career with the agency, he also knows the importance of tradition and  morale among the ranger corps.  </P> <P> The new superintendent at Yosemite might not know those things if he or she  instead had been drawn from the senior executive service, a federal management  super-corps that consists of both career federal officers and political  appointees. Such a proposal has been kicking around the past few years in the  Department of the Interior, the Park Service's parent agency. The idea surfaced  at about the same time the department's top-level political appointees began  meddling in personnel affairs of the Park Service in violation of traditional  practice.  </P> <P> Yosemite and Yellowstone apparently were singled out because they are such  visible natural catalysts for political controversy. An example was the intense  criticism unjustly heaped on Yellowstone Supt. Robert Barbee during the 1988  fire season. If the Yellowstone and Yosemite appointees came from outside the  Park Service and did not plan full careers in the parks, they might be more  subject to political manipulation.  </P> <P> Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. apparently has decided this was a bad idea  and has dropped it. Good. There should be no further thought given to political  tinkering with the parks. Superintendents must have the freedom to offend  powerful political groups and economic interests, if necessary, in fulfilling  their responsibility to protect the natural integrity of the park lands. Only  if that independence is maintained will the nation's park system have the  benefit of talented people like Michael Finley.  </P></p>

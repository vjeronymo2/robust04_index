			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Arts: The lighter hearted side of Rouault - William Packer discusses the qualities that make this artist unique Georges Rouault was born in 1871 and died in 1958 at the age of 87, to be honoured in death by a state funeral in the church of St. Germain-des-Pres in Paris. Even so, for an artist who had been so prominent in that heroic period of the School of Paris in the first two decades of this century, he had remained in his work, as in his life, a man apart. If he was seen from the start, along with Matisse, Vlaminck and Derain, as one of the leading fauves - indeed he was shown in the eponymous room at the Salon d'Automne of 1905, la cage aux fauves - his innate distinctiveness was immediately apparent. We all know the image, from countless posters and Christmas cards - the dark yet oddly luminous intensity of the colour and the heavy, black delineation of the image, which together betray Rouault's early training in the disciplines of stained-glass: the lowering mood and heavily symbolic religiosity of the imagery; the mournful heads and desolate figures, no less intense. There is much more to Rouault than that, and it is at once the delight and the achievement of this exhibition to bring back to us the whole artist in all the vigour and authority of his first maturity, fully alive to the spirit of the time and yet always his own man. He had trained as a painter, as had Matisse, in the studio at the Ecole des Beaux Arts of the great symbolist painter, Gustave Moreau, and the show opens with a darkly brooding self-portrait of this time, a large drawing of 1895, sadly damaged in the last war. In 1902, already in his thirties, he suffered a serious mental breakdown. His recovery and return to Paris the following year mark a clear break with the past, at least in his work. He would always remain the symbolist at heart, in the spirit that informs his work, but a symbolist that was now, in the immediacy of the statement and the directness of his method, a fully fledged expressionist - which is where this exhibition starts. What is surprising is not the change itself, the immediate mastery demonstrated by the new approach. Munch and Ensor had been active for 20 years and expressionism was in the air. Of all French painters of his time, Rouault is closest in feeling to what the German expressionists were doing, or about to do - Schmidt-Rotluff, Kirchner and the rest. And yet any such comparison can only confirm the essential singularity of Rouault's achievement. For with all the raw visual force with which the particular subjects are seen and presented, there is also a countervailing technical sophistication that is entirely French - that graphic, realist tradition of Lautrec and Degas, Forain and Daumier. It is the combination that makes Rouault unique. There is, too, a further surprise; for, in qualifying and moderating Rouault's authority, both moral and technical, there is revealed in the work a delicacy and lightness of touch, a quality of graphic knowingness and wit that I, for one, had not expected. Once noticed, it is obvious enough. But his work has for so long been shown in single spies, or small groups at best, that such lightness is all too readily swamped. The works are shown here in groups related by theme, and suddenly how much there is to relish and enjoy in these low-life tableaux, these rows of prostitutes and fairground Aunt Sallys, these clowns and players and lugubrious judges. To go from the Academy to its constituents: two Royal Academicians have shows current, though there is barely space here to do more than recommend them to you. Adrian Berg indeed has two on the go: the larger, at the Barbican, a retrospective tour through the particular landscape subjects that have engaged him these 20 years and more, from Regent's Park to the Lake District; the smaller, at the Piccadilly, of the extended series of water-colour studies of the sea and cliffs between Brighton and Beachy Head that occupied him through the summer of last year. Berg is among the most adventurous and radical of our landscape painters, nothing loath to simplify and abstract the image; to indulge colour for its own sake; to fix upon the particular qualities of the mark to see where that might lead; to shift his point of view within the subject, or even physically to turn the canvas on its side and upside-down. The paradox is that such independence of spirit is the direct function of the close attention he invariably fixes upon his subject, immersing himself in it day by day, even season by season. In the days when he lived high above Regent's Park, his paintings would often follow the cycle of the year; and, the next year, around again. Bernard Dunstan, at Agnew's, is the most accomplished of painters and a master of pastel, which, of all the graphic media, is the most delicately demanding. He is an intimiste, a life-long student of Bonnard and Vuillard, moderated by an Englishman's cooler sympathies for Sickert and Nicholson. His subjects are the interior; the chamber orchestra in concert; the nude caught in the morning light; and the civilised cityscape, most of all of Venice, in all lights and all weathers. He does what he does quite beautifully and suffers thereby in his critical reputation: for how, to the serious-minded, can anything so charming be at all serious?

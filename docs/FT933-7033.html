			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / International Capital Markets: Dutch toughen bourse reforms  -A look at efforts to return trading to Amsterdam THE popularity of Dutch shares among foreign investors is proving to be a curse as well as a blessing for the Amsterdam stock exchange. Strong foreign demand for the likes of Royal Dutch, Philips and Heineken means an alarmingly high percentage of trading in Dutch blue chips is now conducted abroad - mainly on London's Stock Exchange Automated Quotation (Seaq) system - rather than in Amsterdam itself. For years, Amsterdam has tried to ward off London's attractions by undertaking gradual reforms, such as abolishing stamp duty, encouraging direct bloc trading between banks, and automating the flow of orders onto the bourse floor. However, these measures have had such little impact that the Amsterdam stock exchange is now gearing up to push through more radical reforms early next year. According to Baron Boudewijn van Ittersum, the bourse's chairman, the difference between the earlier reforms and those scheduled for next year is that 'this time we are going to tackle the very core of the trading system itself'. Until now, a central role on the Amsterdam exchange has been reserved for hoeklieden, or stock jobbers, who bring together supply and demand by setting prices in the stocks in which they specialise. Often under-capitalised, and frequently criticised for their inability to take large positions, the 'hoekmen' are the linchpins of a bourse which traces its history nearly 400 years to the issue of shares by the Dutch East India Company. Under the proposed reforms, the 23 'hoekmen' firms will go, to be replaced by no more than 10 market 'specialist' firms. At the same time, the market will be divided into retail and wholesale segments. In another departure, foreign brokers will be able to take part in the screen-based wholesale market without being present in Amsterdam. Seven foreign-based houses have already taken out special membership of the exchange to participate in a new inter-professional trading system for Dutch government bonds. The retail market will remain the domain of the specialists. The wholesale market will be based around Asset (Amsterdam Stock Exchange Trading System) screens, Amsterdam's answer to Seaq. Completing the new look will be Aida, an inter-professional dealing system modeled on Frankfurt's Ibes. Although it is partially following Seaq's lead, Amsterdam is consciously stopping short of adopting London's reliance on market-making. 'We think the structure we'll have will be stronger than the one London has at the moment, because they lack a retail side and the role of the specialist,' Mr van Ittersum says. The retail and wholesale sides of trading on the Dutch bourse will be linked. Specialists will have to quote firm prices, a stipulation designed to lend support and direction to the screen-based wholesale market, he says. A crucial test of the new consensus in Amsterdam will come in the autumn, when a committee of 'wise men' is due to make recommendations on buying out the bourse's hoekmen, some of whom will be transformed into better-capitalised specialists. Job losses among the 200-strong staff are inevitable. Members will have to approve the plan before the reforms can go ahead. McKinsey, the consultancy group, published a report on trading in Dutch shares in late 1992. Before then, any talk of doing away with the hoekman was almost taboo. But McKinsey's survey of investors showed that 40 per cent of trading in Dutch shares had leaked abroad, chiefly to London. The situation in Dutch bonds was even bleaker, with just 32 per cent traded at home, though this came as little surprise. Perhaps the most worrying statistic was that just 33 per cent of 'bloc' trades in Dutch shares, worth more than Fl 1m (Dollars 525,000), was conducted in Amsterdam in 1991, against 68 per cent in 1988. McKinsey also showed that investors, including Dutch ones, were unhappy with Dutch banks and brokerages, complaining of uncompetitive rates and an aversion to taking risks in the market. This accounted for the trend towards seeking the services of foreign brokers, who in turn were more likely to use Seaq than Amsterdam. Mr van Ittersum said Dutch banks and brokers had now committed themselves to playing an active part in the new system. They will, in any case, 'need to stick their necks out' more if they want to continue to create a primary market for the larger, internationally-orientated Dutch companies and to serve the Netherlands' powerful institutional investors, he said. He noted that of all Europe's bourses, Amsterdam was the most exposed to competition from London. With a small home market and a preponderance of international companies, it relies on foreign buying of shares and, particularly, of bonds. Because of its greater vulnerability, it is also 'the first bourse on the continent that is ready to put a strategy vis-a-vis London into practice', he said.</p>

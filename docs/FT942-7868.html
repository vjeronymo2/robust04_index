			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Need for Dollars 980bn of new airliners seen Boeing, the world's largest manufacturer of commercial aircraft, yesterday forecast demand for new airliners worth Dollars 980bn (Pounds 650bn) in the next 20 years to meet the growth in air travel and the need by airlines to replace older jets. In its annual civil aircraft market outlook, the US manufacturer said that Dollars 731bn worth of new aircraft would be needed to accommodate future air traffic growth and Dollars 249bn would be required to replace older aircraft. The relatively optimistic forecast also notes that the civil aircraft market is becoming increasingly competitive. 'There are only 600 airlines in the world. Only 125 of those airlines buy new airplanes. And the 20 largest airlines buy 60 per cent of all new commercial airplanes,' said Mr Richard James, Boeing's vice president of marketing. 'In such a concentrated market, you can't afford to miss a single strategic sale.' Although the market continued to suffer from the four - year - long slump in civil aircraft demand caused by airline losses, the recession and the impact of the Gulf war, Mr James said the second half of the 1990s looked more promising for the industry. 'The recovery is already well under way in the US, and the widely held expectation is that Europe is in the road to recovery,' he said. He added that while the Japanese economy was still struggling, the rest of Asia was experiencing robust growth. Boeing expects the biggest growth in air travel to come from the Asian markets during the next 20 years. Overall, Boeing is forecasting passenger air travel growth of around 5.2 per cent a year over the next 20 years. International traffic is also expected to continue providing a greater share of overall world air transport. It accounted for 44 per cent of all revenue passenger miles 20 years ago and the figure now is nearly half. Boeing expects it to account for 54 per cent of all travel in 20 years time, with domestic traffic making up the other 46 per cent. Although Boeing said it was difficult to predict how many older 70- to 170-seat aircraft would be retired in the next two years, it predicted that about 1,200 would have to be retired by 1999 because they would be more than 30 years old. By the year 2000, the number of total replacement aircraft would probably rise to 3,000 because of airlines' need to comply with stricter noise regulations from the beginning of the next century.</p>

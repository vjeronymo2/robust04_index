			<p>BFN     [Text] About 500 Cambodian traders were forced to return  to Poipet township by Thai authorities yesterday after they  tried to get to the Thai market in the Klongluek-Poipet area of  this border town.    Klongluek-Poipet border point, inside Thailand, where  thousands of traders from both countries meet to trade mostly  Thai goods to Cambodia--was closed by Thai authorities two weeks  ago after artillery shells from Cambodia landed on Thai  territory.    None of the Cambodian warring factions has claimed  responsibility or paid damages.    The Cambodian traders told Thai authorities they were  informed by Cambodian officials that the border was open and  they were allowed to trade in Thailand.    They said they had paid a fee of 10 baht each to Cambodian  officials to get a border pass.    The 500 Cambodian traders, after being told of the  situation,  decided to return after two hours, according to the report.    One trader, Linda Ree, 18, who trades in silverware along  the  border, said she had been happy with the news the border was  open.    She has rented a small stall at the border point in Thailand  where Thai people still owe her about 4,000 baht. She wants to  get the money, said Miss Linda.    She said that following the border closure, the Poipet  market  place had been quiet. All kinds of goods from Thailand have  been soaring in price and the people are suffering.    In a related report, the Committee for Controlling Trade  along the Thai-Cambodian border said they would meet on April 25  to discuss the border opening.    Measures to protect Thai people along the border and their  property need to be discussed with the Cambodian Government  before the border is opened, said the report.    There is also a need to discuss the two countries' trading  systems at the local level before the border can be reopened,  expected early next month.</p>

			<p><P> June 2, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LOCAL ELECTIONS / SHERIFF;  </P> <P> CAMPAIGN IS A SHOWDOWN AT THE O.C. CORRAL;  </P> <P> TAKING ON A FORMIDABLE OPPONENT LIKE GATES WITH MODEST FUNDS COULD BE A  CANDIDATE'S NIGHTMARE, BUT BANKHEAD SAYS 'THE CHEAPEST WAY IS SOMETIMES THE  BEST.'  </P> <P> Fullerton City Councilman Don Bankhead says he didn't really want to challenge  Sheriff Brad Gates in the June election.  </P> <P> But when he went to a meeting a few months ago at an Irvine hotel called by  longtime Gates opponents in hope of finding a candidate, the former Fullerton  police captain suddenly found himself on center stage.  </P> <P> "I really came down (to the meeting) with the thought of locating someone and  helping him," Bankhead said. No other candidate surfaced, however, and now the  task of trying to unseat the powerful, four-term sheriff, who has political  connections that most Orange County officeholders can only dream of, fell to  Bankhead.  </P> <P> A 31-year veteran of the Fullerton Police Department, Bankhead has a fraction  of the campaign money that Gates has -- $33,000 to the sheriff's $126,000,  according to the most recent statements -- and a smattering of endorsements.  But he is counting on the negative publicity that Gates has received over the  past several years to put him over the top.  </P> <P> "It's going to be difficult without money," Bankhead said recently. "But the  cheapest way is sometimes the best way. . . . Enough things have occurred over  the past few years that people are kind of ready for a change."  </P> <P> Gates has easily won reelection three times over the past 12 years. But he also  has been repeatedly embroiled in controversy over whether he has abused his  authority. The county has paid out at least $1.5 million to settle lawsuits  with Gates' political and personal rivals -- some of whom are active in  Bankhead's campaign -- who claimed that he used his department to harass them.  </P> <P> "I don't think there is any need for these kinds of suits, not if you treat  people like human beings," Bankhead said. "If he (Gates) violates someone's  rights, why doesn't he pay, instead of the taxpayers? . . . He seems to think  the laws are made for everyone else."  </P> <P> An angry Gates said that Bankhead is singing the same old tired song he has  heard for years and that he will have no more of it.  </P> <P> "I am tired of people picking on me personally," Gates said. "We did our job  fairly. We followed the law and addressed the facts. My department does a great  job, and I am proud of what we do."  </P> <P> Bankhead said he is supportive of most of the Sheriff's Department's programs  and policies, although he thinks that the duties of sheriff and coroner should  be separated, as they are in all other large California counties.  </P> <P> "I'm not running against the working cops on the street," Bankhead said. "I'm  running against Brad Gates. . . . The things the sheriff does, he feels he's  not going to be held responsible for them."  </P> <P> Gates has also come under fire in recent years for mingling the business of  sheriff with personal real estate ventures, which total more than $8 million in  transactions since he took office in 1974. His portfolio has included shopping  centers, custom homes, apartments and what will become the largest equestrian  center in Orange County. Many of his business partners are among the county's  elite, who also serve as board members of the Sheriff's Advisory Council, a  nonprofit group that raises money for Sheriff's Department projects and  equipment.  </P> <P> Gates' wealth and property dealings initially were investigated in 1977 and  1978 by the state Justice Department, the FBI and a federal grand jury. No  criminal charges resulted.  </P> <P> Gates has denied using his office for personal gain. "I am taking the high road  in this race," he said. "The issues in this race are drugs and (overcrowded)  jails. . . . I have the experience to solve those problems. I am not afraid to  get involved in controversy and not afraid to step out on the drug issue."  </P> <P> Gates has made attacking the drug problem the cornerstone of his  administration, and he said that one of his priorities in a fifth term would be  to end drug abuse and jail overcrowding, which he called "the basic core of all  our problems."  </P> <P> Gates' anti-drug efforts are recognized even among federal officials.  </P> <P> Twice in the last two years, Gates invited President Bush to Orange County to  deliver anti-drug messages, and both times the invitation was accepted. On his  most recent visit, Bush helped kick off an anti-drug campaign for  schoolchildren sponsored by the "Drug Use Is Life Abuse" program, which is  funded by business, industry and individual citizens.  </P> <P> Gates was also successful in getting Orange County included in a federal  program that designates certain regions as "high-intensity drug-use areas." The  distinction will mean that the county can share with Los Angeles County about  $5 million in additional federal funds to combat drug use.  </P> <P> And Gates says that the Regional Narcotics Task Force, a group of investigators  from the county's police departments and under command of the Sheriff's  Department, has been rated the most effective unit of its type in the nation by  the FBI.  </P> <P> Another achievement that Gates is proud of is the genetic crime lab that his  department recently opened -- the first operated by a local law enforcement  agency in California.  </P> <P> Comparing his qualifications to those of his opponent, Gates noted that  Bankhead was passed up twice for chief during his tenure at the Fullerton  Police Department.  </P> <P> But Bankhead said he has enough experience to run the Sheriff's Department: He  was in charge of the Fullerton department's uniform division for two years and  then all criminal investigations for eight years, and served as acting chief in  the police chief's absence.  </P> <P> Besides, Bankhead said, Gates' long years in office have removed him from any  sense of accountability to the voters.  </P> <P> "I was always taught that if the wheel doesn't squeak, grease it, and if it  squeaks, fix it," Bankhead said. "The Sheriff's Department has been squeaking  for a long time."  </P> <P> </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY SHERIFF  </P> <P> Brad Gates  </P> <P> Age: 51  </P> <P> Home: San Juan Capistrano  </P> <P> Occupation: Sheriff-coroner  </P> <P> Background: Joined the Sheriff's Department in 1961. Was assigned to guard duty  in the County Jail, rose to the rank of undersheriff and, with the backing of  outgoing Sheriff James A. Musick, ran in 1974 for the office of sheriff. Has  been reelected three times since.  </P> <P> Issues: Supports keeping the offices of sheriff and coroner together; wants to  use Rancho del Rio, a confiscated South County property, for a regional  narcotics training center although the Board of Supervisors has voted to sell  the land; opposes privatization or extensive use of non-sworn personnel in  jails.  </P> <P> Don Bankhead  </P> <P> Age: 57  </P> <P> Home: Fullerton  </P> <P> Occupation: Retired police captain, currently a city councilman  </P> <P> Background: Joined the Fullerton Police Department in 1957. Rose to captain in  1980. Retired in 1988 and was elected to the Fullerton City Council that  November.  </P> <P> Issues: Wants to separate the offices of sheriff and coroner and give the  public more access to coroner's investigations; opposes the idea of Orange  County's opening a narcotics training center on its own, without the help of  cities or the state; would put some non-sworn personnel in jails as a  cost-cutting measure.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] "The outcome of the inter-Tajik talks held in  Moscow can be qualified as "completely satisfactory." The main  thing is that a dialogue began, and that it proceeded  constructively enough. It's also indicative that the launch of  the negotiating mechanism led to lowering the intensity of  violations on the border between Tajikistan and Afghanistan,"  the Director of the 3d Asian Department of Russia's Foreign  Ministry, Yuriy Kotov, told INTERFAX on Wednesday.    According to him, "nothing great" was expected from the  talks  in Moscow. "We did not expect the two sides to reach  comprehensive agreements at once. It's gratifying enough that  they worked out an extensive agenda, adopted a statement on the  need to refrain from any actions conducive to complicating the  process of talks, agreed to form a commission on refugees, and  coordinated a joint communique," the diplomat said.</p>

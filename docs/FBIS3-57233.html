			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Defense Minister Pavel Kozlovskiy at the Supreme </F> Soviet in Minsk on 18 January]    [Text] Esteemed People's Deputies!    We were presented by history with this unique opportunity to  ensure a worthy place for our young independent state on the  European continent at a time when the world has rid itself of  the hostile standoff of military blocs and confrontation between  West and East.    It would be naive to overlook the fact that nowadays, the  world is developing according to laws based on a new reality.  Ever increasing economic, technological, informational, and  cultural relations among states have already prompted us to  redefine the notion of neutrality. Policies of all neutral  European states are definitely shifting toward active  participation in all-European processes sponsored by the United  Nations and CSCE, as well as activation of links with the EC.  The tendency toward the political unification of West Europe is  all the more conspicuous.    The situation east of Belarus is unfolding no less  dynamically. Contrary to predictions, the CIS has not  disintegrated but is developing, despite serious difficulties.    The last year made a substantial impact on CIS member  states,  bringing their positions closer and deepening their all-around  cooperation. Many republics redefined their position in favor  of expanding integration within the CIS, which was evidenced by  the meeting in Ashgabat on 23-24 December 1993. This meeting  was attended by 11 of the 12 CIS defense ministers -- absent was  the Moldovan minister. It was unanimously agreed that the CIS  Allied Armed Forces General Command be replaced with the Staff  for Coordination of Military Cooperation. All the states --  including Ukraine, whose position has until recently been  reduced to observer status -- declared their intent to  participate in its work. All defense ministers concurred in the  opinion that it is easier to resolve problems connected with the  building of military forces in cooperation and conjunction with  one another. The newly created staff is designed to coordinate  this process. I think everyone understands that the elimination  of the CIS General Command put the idea of forming an Allied  Armed Forces out of the question. From now on, issues connected  with operational use of CIS national forces lie exclusively with  the competence of their own governments.    All speculations about the possibility of dispatching troops  to "hot spots" proved unfounded. Not one single serviceman will  ever be sent outside our country without the permission of the  Belarusian Supreme Soviet.    We intend to participate actively in the activities of the  Staff for Coordination of Military Cooperation. It will be  staffed based on the coalition and equal-footing principle. Our  representatives there will seek closer cooperation with other  CIS countries in the military sphere, which is of vital  importance to our Armed Forces at this time. Bilateral contacts  do not offer as many opportunities for cooperation as we would  like.    Although we have concluded bilateral agreements with the  Russian Federation and Ukraine, they do not work stably without  a system of coordination. Everything comes down to financial  relations and the system of licenses and duties. In our  opinion, every concluded agreement must be part of a system of  agreements among states, and the Treaty on Collective Security  is absolutely essential to this system.    The issue of Belarusian entry into the collective security  treaty has been repeatedly debated at different levels. We are  familiar with the opinions of our partners about conditions that  Belarus put forward while joining the treaty. All agree that  you cannot participate in it partially. As for the present  conditions, they simply specify our understanding of Articles 4  and 6 without altering their meaning. I would like you to  examine them once again.    Out of 11 articles of the treaty, none encroaches on our  Republic's sovereignty and its intention to achieve neutrality.  To do this, one should ensure a reliable security for society  and the state, lay the foundation for peaceful relations with  neighbors, and receive security and support guarantees from  friendly states in case of outside aggression.    The idea of neutrality can be actually implemented after  three problems are solved:    In economy -- development of strong basic industries capable  of ensuring the stable and independent operation of the economy;    In politics -- recognition of our neutrality by other states  and their guarantee to respect its existence;    And finally, the third problem is a well-trained Armed  Forces  to protect sovereignty -- if need be, with arms -- and a  comprehensive system of their support. As you can see, these  problems have not been solved yet.    All provisions of the treaty can serve as and are designed  to be a security guarantee for Belarus. For example, the  document's preamble is based on the sovereignty of independent  states. Article 2 provides for the mechanism of joint  consultations in the event of a threat, which also complies with  the proclaimed principles. There are no corrections in the  remaining articles, except for Articles 4 and 6.    In Article 4, we propose to specify the passage "Providing  necessary assistance, including military"; while in Article 6,  we emphasize that the decision to use the Belarusian Armed  Forces lies exclusively with the competence of the Supreme  Soviet, and can only be executed in accordance with Belarusian  law. These reservations do not run counter to the goals and  objectives of the treaty, and I think will raise no doubts on  the part of its participants, the number of which will now rise  to nine.    Close military cooperation with CIS countries will reduce  our  losses while reforming our Armed Forces, secure the civilized  withdrawal of Russian troops from Belarusian territory, help  maintain high combat readiness of the Army that would be  equipped with modern arms, and create favorable internal and  external conditions for establishing the state.    This will also ensure a positive solution of the issue of  Belarus' share of nuclear fuel produced from warhead uranium  processing after the removal of nuclear weapons from Belarusian  territory.    Unfortunately, the need of the Armed Forces for  material-technical supplies (production, repairs, armaments and  equipment regulations, shipments of ZIP, AKB, [expansions  unknown] etc.) and personnel training can only be met through  military cooperation with other CIS countries. The Belarusian  Republic has every right to benefit from the scientific and  technical potential of the Soviet Armed Forces.    Belarusian scientific and military-complex enterprises will  not receive any orders from the CIS countries before we take a  common interest in guaranteeing our own security.    Today, the potential of Air Force equipment is practically  exhausted; due to the lack of repair funds, design bureaus,  etc., other equipment is on the verge of collapse, servicing  equipment of air defense, rocket, and air forces. [sentence as  published]    A question may arise here: Could these three problems  possibly be solved by signing the collective security treaty?  Of course, we will not get anything for free. However, as an  equal partner, we will enjoy privileges and benefits in the  system of joint production, equipment repair and servicing, and  exchanges of technology and military information. Common use of  airspace, communication routes, airfields, and testing grounds  promises substantial economic advantages.    Let me also remind you that we need military cooperation  with  other CIS countries if only to maintain the combat readiness of  the Belarusian Armed Forces at a high level. For us, joining  the collective security treaty is economically justified. For  example, unification of air defense forces, anti-rocket defense  forces, intelligence, and other components would greatly enhance  national security. We see no alternative here.    Following the example of some European states, Belarus can  join the collective security system reserving the right to  participate in peacekeeping operations only in regions  representing a threat to the security of our state.    Germany, one of NATO's most active members, participates in  the collective security system based on such principles.    Besides, without our own military industry and a developed  system of arms purchases, and without having solved all problems  concerning international treaties on conventional arms reduction  in Europe, we are forced to maintain the closest possible  contacts with all CIS states.    All these arguments -- and they can be much more expanded --  underline the need for explicit ratification of the Treaty on  Collective Security that took Belarus so much effort to sign.    Concluding, let me stress again that given the developing  situation and the present economic situation, one should not see  the status of neutrality as a goal in itself. I am confident  that all of our neighbors, which want to see our state as a  thriving and reliable partner, will understand this. It is not  admissible to remain neutral to any integration processes that  are rapidly gathering speed. Today, instead of its classical  form, neutrality can assume a differentiating and selective  nature.    The true condition of the Armed Forces and a search for  anti-  crisis solutions force me to call upon you to ratify the Treaty  on Collective Security.</p>

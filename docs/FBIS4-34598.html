			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Miryam Hazan] </F>   [Text] Pedro Aspe, secretary of finance and public credit  -- without directly mentioning Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho  Solis' resignation -- has said that recently we have been  wrapped up in an unexpected problem that has disheartened many  Mexicans.    Athough domestic as well as foreign events have translated  into uncertainty in domestic markets, we should be conscious of  the temporary nature of these events and not lose sight of the  important economic progress we have achieved, Aspe said.    During yesterday's inauguration of Banco Capital -- a new  institution comprising several banks belonging to the Capital  Financial Group -- Pedro Aspe said the banking sector is moving  toward universal banking. This not only means that a wide range  of financial services will now be offered through bank windows,  but it also implies the creation of special market niches and  increased competitive advantages in a dynamic market. According  to information delivered by Aspe, the new bank will initiate  operations with paid capital of 120 million pesos, and its aim  will be to offer services to small and medium-sized industries,  particularly in Mexico City. Banco Capital now joins the  invoicing, renting, and guarantee companies previously held by  Capital Group.    According to Jaime Weiss, chairman of this financial group's  Board of Directors, capital has grown from 3 million new pesos  at the beginning of 1990 to 420 million new pesos at the end of  last month. The executive said that another division --  institutional investments -- has been added to the existing one  -- which in the coming months will feature 280 million new pesos  to achieve total capital of 700 million new pesos.    Jaime Weiss also indicated that in 1993, Capital Financial  Group placed 723 million new pesos in new credit among 3,563  customers, and, should this trend continue, it has scheduled the  placing of more than 1 billion new pesos among 1,200 new  customers.    The new institution will have a nationwide presence and is  scheduled to open four branches this year. The services offered  will include investment services, consumer credit, contract  loans, bridge loans, and nonrevolving mortgages, along with  trustee services, foreign exchange and credit services via  automatic tellers, as well as others.</p>

			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / Fisons serves up another bitter pill with 27% slide Fisons, the drugs and scientific equipment company, disappointed the market yet again yesterday with interim profits down 27 per cent from Pounds 41.5m to Pounds 30.4m. The dividend was cut almost in half from 3.3p to 1.7p, and the shares fell 15p to 135p. Mr Patrick Egan, chairman, could provide little cheer for the immediate future, warning that 'the trading environment is expected to remain challenging on all fronts and it is unlikely that, for the group as a whole, any marked improvement in profitability levels can occur during the remainder of this year.' Mr Robin Gilbert, analyst at stockbroker Panmure Gordon, said: 'It is disappointing to see yet another set of figures that falls short of expectations'. Since 1991, Fisons has seen the departure of two chief executives and had to issue three profits warnings. Fisons' troubled scientific instruments division saw trading losses increase more than five-fold from Pounds 2.1m to Pounds 11.8m on sales barely changed at Pounds 114m (Pounds 115.5m). Mr Egan said the previous year's loss should have been higher but costs 'had been pushed into the second half.' The company's pharmaceuticals division saw sales rise from Pounds 209.8m to Pounds 240.7m. Trading profits rose from Pounds 28.8m to Pounds 36.3m, an increase exaggerated by the decision taken last December to discontinue 'trade loading' - the oversupply of distributors at relatively low profit margins. On a like-for-like basis, pharmaceuticals sales growth was about 4 per cent. Sales of Fisons' long-established asthma drug Intal rose from Pounds 83m to Pounds 104m. Intal faces a more difficult second half in the US where competition from generic (unbranded) rivals began in earnest in May. The new asthma drug Tilade saw sales jump 41 per cent to Pounds 21m, although Fisons said this had not matched its expectations in the important US market. Trading profits at the laboratory supplies division fell from Pounds 15.3m to Pounds 10.1m on sales up from Pounds 238.6m to Pounds 251.9m. Mr Egan called the result 'a great shame' because the division had performed relatively well during the previous two years. Group turnover fell from Pounds 651.4m to Pounds 640.3m. There was a net cash outflow of Pounds 71.1m, compared with an inflow of Pounds 144.5m, leading to a rise in gearing to 57 per cent from 40 per cent at the end of 1993. Earnings per share fell from 4.1p to 3p. Lex, Page 20</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondent Vladimir Gondusov] </F>   [Text] Sevastopol June 3 TASS -- The Varyag  aircraft-carrying cruiser, whose construction was begun in 1987  in Nikolayev and suspended three years ago, will be scrapped on  decision of the Ukrainian authorities. The metal will be sold  abroad.    The cruiser of over 60,000 tonnes displacement is 340 meters  long and 76 meters wide. Russia has several ships of the type,  including Kiev, Novorossiisk and Minsk.    Kiev has scrapped the almost-built Ulyanov aircraft-carrier,  and sold its metal abroad dirt cheap, Deputy Black Sea Fleet  Commander for Operation and Repairs Rear-Admiral Aleksandr  Aladkin told ITAR- TASS today. The same will be done to the  ships to be received by Kiev as result of the Black Sea Fleet  division.    The Admiral is skeptical about Ukrainian claims the republic  is a major ship-building state. In his words, all the eight  ship- building plants of the republic depend on the delivery of  accessories. "It is half the work to build a ship's hull. It  should be equipped and armed, and Ukraine cannot do this on its  own," said Aladkin.    The Nikolayev plant has almost finalized the construction of  the Admiral Lobov cruiser. But they will still have to buy an  air-defence system which is produced in Russia and costs 65  billion rubles, he added.    Aladkin is sure that the Black Sea Fleet should be divided  as  soon as possible, as this is the only way "to make sure that  Ukraine is unable to maintain even a small part of the fleet".</p>

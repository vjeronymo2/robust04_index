			<p><P> March 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KOHL: DANCING AROUND THE BORDER  </P> <P> The West German government's exercise of damage control on the politically  sensitive issue of Poland's border is welcome and may even soothe Europe's  nerves. But it would be even more soothing if Chancellor Helmut Kohl would  simply say what needs saying.  </P> <P> His hesitation stems from one of democracy's shabbier sights -- a politician  avoiding candor in the hope of appealing to small numbers of voters on the  fringe of an issue. Usually the only casualty is the politician's integrity.  But with Kohl on Poland, that is the least of it.  </P> <P> For political purposes, Kohl still refuses to say that a reunified Germany  would honor the border with Poland that was set -- generally along the Oder and  Neisse rivers -- after World War II. Why? Because a relatively small number of  Germans want the prewar borders restored, a position that drives Poles up the  wall and reminds the rest of Europe and its allies that it was the Third  Reich's craving for land that led to war in 1939.  </P> <P> The United States' position is clear enough. While Kohl kept dancing all around  the issue at Camp David, President Bush said after their recent meetings that  "the U.S. recognizes the current . . . border"; Secretary of State James A.  Baker III said Tuesday that the border is "inviolable."  </P> <P> What Kohl is doing would be bad enough under any circumstances, but the  election for which he is trying to scoop up fringe votes will not take place  until December. The harm he will do to the cause of freedom and peace in Europe  if he plays this game until then cannot be exaggerated. A spokesman in Bonn  says that the parliaments of both Germanys could vote to honor the existing  border after next month's election in East Germany. That is a big help, but  it's not really a substitute for some statesmanlike candor on Kohl's part.  </P></p>

			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Japanese rates Last week's Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development report calling for a cut in Japanese interest rates was out of date. Compiled in the summer, the study argued that although nominal rates were at a historic low, in real terms rates were too high. That was because of Japan's negative inflation, currently running at about minus 1.5 per cent. However, the need for a cut has been obviated by Japan's continuing, if unspectacular, economic growth and the yen's recent depreciation against the dollar following US interest rate rises. Nevertheless, the OECD's argument that the yen's strength is the biggest threat to Japan's tentative recovery remains compelling. While interest rates may not need to be cut again, the Bank of Japan should certainly not increase them. The rise in overnight call rates suggests the Bank is tempted to raise rates in an effort to maintain pressure on the corporate sector. In theory, an increase in the cost of capital and an appreciation of the yen would oblige Japanese companies to address their three surpluses: capacity, stocks and staff. But an increase in rates could damage domestic demand as well as jeopardise the prospects of Japan's exporters. With the yen higher, Japanese exports to the US and Asia could struggle as these economies revert to more normal growth rates next year or in 1996. Guiding Japanese interest rates will not be easy: Mr Yasuo Matsushita, who starts as Bank of Japan governor at the end of this week, has a difficult task before him.</p>

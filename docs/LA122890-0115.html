			<p><P> December 28, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CSUN'S FISHER WAITS, HOPING FOR NEW GRADE  </P> <P> Whether Cal State Northridge basketball center Percy Fisher regains his  eligibility hinges on his efforts to have a D+ grade changed to a C-.  </P> <P> Fisher, who learned late Wednesday that he was 0.01 shy of the cumulative 2.0  grade-point average required, was so shocked by his history grade that he  thought a mistake had been made.  </P> <P> "I hope there was a mistake and I hope there is a change in his favor," CSUN  Coach Pete Cassidy said, noting that it is not uncommon for grades to be  changed for regular students after they are posted.  </P> <P> "(But) coaches can't talk to professors," Cassidy added. "It is a university  rule and it is a good one."  </P> <P> Erik Cooper, who also missed the first semester because of academic  ineligibility, is still waiting for all of his grades to be posted.  </P> <P> Cooper and Fisher have struggled academically despite the efforts of Cassidy  and his staff, which include monitoring classroom attendance.  </P> <P> "We do the best we can," Cassidy said. "Can you wake a kid up in the morning  and walk him around campus? When we find out they are negligent we call them to  task, but there is a time when a man has to stand up and be counted. They know  the importance of this." THERESA MUNOZ  </P></p>

			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / Bosnian Moslem leader agrees to partition plan for republic INTERNATIONAL mediators yesterday achieved a breakthrough in their efforts to bring about a political settlement in Bosnia, when Moslem president Alija Izetbegovic reluctantly agreed to its division into a union of three republics. At the same time military commanders of Bosnia's three warring factions agreed steps to implement an immediate ceasefire in the 16-month war, which has killed tens of thousands and created 2m refugees. But Mr Izetbegovic said his agreement was 'preliminary' and conditional on Bosnian parliament approval. Drawing up precise maps of the proposed Serb, Croat and Moslem-dominated republics over the weekend would be 'the most difficult part of the job', he added. His grudging agreement came on the fourth day of negotiations in Geneva between the Bosnian factions, plus the presidents of Serbia and Croatia. Mr Izetbegovic has long clung to the aim of a federal republic with a strong central government rather than an ethnic carve-up of Bosnia. But with the Moslems battered militarily and bunched into besieged enclaves, he appears to have caved in to domestic and international pressure for a settlement more in line with Serbo-Croat demands for separate ethnic mini-states. Describing the negotiations as 'very hard', Mr Izetbegovic said it was eventually agreed Bosnia would remain one state with its international borders intact rather than an alliance of completely separate states. The UN said the agreement was not substantially different from the proposal submitted by Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, the international mediators. It was reached 'after intensive discussion on a number of drafts, with amendments agreed by all three parties', a UN official said. A weak central government would be given control over foreign affairs and international trade. Serbia's President Slobodan Milosevic welcomed the agreement. 'It completely affirms Srpska Republika,' he said in reference to the self-styled Serbian state, which has militarily extended its sway over 70 per cent of Bosnia. Mr Mirko Pejanovic, a member of the Bosnian leadership, said the map negotiations would be 'difficult'. Asked if the deal meant ethnic division, Mr Pejanovic said: 'It is a heavy price. But it is one we have to pay if there is to be peace.' In Sarajevo, the rival military commanders agreed on details of how to implement the ceasefire at an eight-hour meeting. They agreed to meet daily, along with UN officials, from tomorrow to ensure the ceasefire held. The ceasefire was ordered by Bosnia's political leaders on Thursday. Dozens of previous ceasefire agreements have collapsed but Gen Jean Cot, UN supreme commander in former Yugoslavia, said there were grounds for more hope this time. Earlier, a Spanish soldier was killed and 17 wounded when shells pounded a UN barracks in Jablanica, south-west of Sarajevo.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposal would revise stayed &sect;75.313(c)(2) and (c)(3) which address deenergization of electric power circuits and shutting-off of mechanized equipment not located on working sections. It also would revise paragraph (d)(1)(i) and (ii) and (d)(2) which deal with examination of the mine before miners can return when power is restored. The Agency is not proposing a revision of paragraphs (a), (b), (c)(1), and (e) at this time. These paragraphs of stayed &sect;75.313 would remain unchanged from the stayed provision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under paragraph (c)(2) of the proposal, underground electrical circuits must be deenergized, except those circuits necessary for withdrawal if such circuits are located in areas and haulageways where methane is not likely to migrate into or accumulate. The remaining energized circuits would be deenergized as persons are withdrawn. The Agency recognizes that in a limited number of mines methane may migrate from adjacent areas and enter travelways or haulageways used by miners for withdrawal. Under these conditions, permitting power circuits to remain energized may increase the potential for a methane ignition. The determination of the likelihood of methane migrating into haulageways can be made through underground tests or computer simulations of ventilation systems. It is the intention of the Agency that when it is determined that methane is likely to accumulate or migrate into an area, electrical circuits used for transportation would not be permitted to remain energized and persons would not be permitted to ride out of the mine in the event of a fan stoppage. The Agency would expect the operator to provide the necessary data from which a determination can be made. For the same reasons, paragraph (c)(3) of the proposal would require mechanized equipment not located on working sections to be shut off unless the equipment is necessary to withdraw persons from the mine and is located in areas where methane migration or accumulation is unlikely to occur. The Agency solicits comments on the appropriateness of this type of mine-specific evaluation that balances the expeditious withdrawal of miners against the potential for methane accumulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under paragraphs (d)(1)(i) and (ii) of the proposal, the Agency is clarifying that when ventilation is restored and before electrical circuits are energized or nonpermissible mechanized equipment is started, no one other than designated certified examiners would be permitted to enter or reenter any underground area of the mine until an examination is conducted as described in &sect;75.360(b) through (e) and the area is determined to be safe. This would prohibit nonpermissible mechanized equipment from being started until an examination is completed. However, permissible equipment may be used to facilitate the examination required by the proposal. The Agency recognizes that it may not be possible for examiners to enter the mine without some power being restored in shafts or slopes to power elevators, hoists, or other mechanical facilities operated in the shaft or slope. The Agency does not intend to prohibit these facilities from being energized when used to facilitate the examination, provided they are in intake air and the power is limited to the shaft or slope in which they operate. The Agency solicits comments on this approach to fan stoppages.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This examination would not be equivalent to a full-scale preshift examination in that (1) a preshift is conducted within 3 hours preceding the beginning of the shift, and (2) the recordkeeping requirements of &sect;75.360 would not apply for the examination following a fan stoppage. However, in accordance with proposed &sect;75.363, a record of all hazardous conditions found would be required. This type of examination is an accepted safety practice in the industry. It is a primary means for determining the effectiveness of a mine's ventilation system and of detecting hazards such as methane accumulations that may be present in travelways or other areas where miners may work after an interruption of ventilation. After a fan is restarted, the examination will determine if the air is moving in its proper direction and at its normal volume.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency has reconsidered its position in stayed &sect;75.313(d)(2) and proposed in paragraph (d)(2) to specifically require miners, other than designated certified examiners, to continue to the surface should the fan restart during withdrawal. A commenter has maintained that following a fan stoppage, a hazard could occur due to methane accumulations, and therefore miners should not be permitted to remain underground. MSHA agrees that such methane accumulations could occur, but believes that any risk of ignition would be significantly reduced by the requirement that mechanized equipment be shut off and electrical power circuits deenergized except for equipment and power circuits necessary for withdrawal if located in areas or haulageways where methane is not likely to migrate to or accumulate. Under stayed &sect;75.313, the equipment or circuits used for withdrawal must be shut off or deenergized as persons are withdrawn. However, to provide an added margin of safety, MSHA is proposing withdrawal of all miners to the surface except designated certified examiners who may begin the examination required before miners return to underground areas. The Agency specifically solicits comments on this issue.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This commenter further stated that when a fan is down for an extended period of time, a fan should not be restarted until miners safely reach the surface. However, as stated in the preamble to the existing rule, MSHA believes that the fan should be restarted as soon as possible to reestablish proper ventilation and to remove the potential for methane accumulations. The Agency solicits comments on the pros and cons of reestablishing ventilation by restarting a mine fan during evacuation, and on having miners continue to the surface should a fan restart during withdrawal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

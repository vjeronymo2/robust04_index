			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / Domestic air travel shows increase of 5.5% DOMESTIC AIR travel showed its sharpest rise for more than a year during March, indicating greater confidence among UK businesses which buy most of the tickets for internal flights. The latest traffic figures from BAA, which operates London's airports and three in Scotland, show a 5.5 per cent year-on-year increase in domestic passenger traffic. The last time such a rise was recorded, in February last year, it was attributed to a bounce back from the depressed figures of two years ago in the aftermath of the Gulf war. Without the Gulf war effect, March showed the biggest rise since August 1990. The recovery in traffic echoes mild optimism in some quarters of the airline industry. Many airlines operating across the North Atlantic, for example, have increased capacity by more than 10 per cent for the summer season. BAA's former chairman Sir Norman Payne believes the traffic growth on the busy London-Edinburgh route closely fitted the trend in Britain's gross domestic product. But British Airways damped hopes that domestic traffic was recovering sharply. It said the domestic travel business was 'still broadly depressed'. Traffic from BAA airports to the rest of Europe increased more quickly than domestic traffic, rising 9.6 per cent over March 1992. The upward trend has been established for many months but may also be a reflection of increased business done as a result of the European Community single market which began on January 1. Much of the gain was at the expense of short-haul charter traffic, down 4.2 per cent. This may have been a consequence of the modest fare cuts that some of Europe's scheduled airlines introduced in the wake of the EC's partial liberalisation of air traffic. Stansted, London's loss-making third airport, continued to struggle to establish itself as an alternative to Heathrow and Gatwick. While passenger traffic grew by 5.7 per cent, the number of aircraft take-offs fell 8.3 per cent. Robert Taylor writes: There are no signs of any real recovery in the British printing industry, according to the quarterly survey by the British Printing Industries Federation. Only 10 per cent of its sample of companies enjoyed an improvement in their trading conditions between mid-December and mid-March, compared with 34 per cent who had expected them to be better. The survey says: 'There have been too many false dawns and withered green shoots to allow printers to be positively cheerful. Companies are chary too, simply because they can detect little in the way of real confidence among their customers or in the economy at large.'</p>

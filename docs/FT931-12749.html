			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: London traders sceptical about US merger THE LONDON Metal Exchange might have to change its strategy for the US market if the proposed merger of the Chicago Board of Trade and New York's Commodity Exchange is consummated, said Mr David King, the LME's chief executive, yesterday. 'It would be a very strong partnership because the CBoT already is the most powerful and largest futures exchange. If the merger goes through the goal posts will have been moved in the US and the LME would have to work harder to increase its penetration of the market there.' However, Mr King, like some LME traders, pointed out that Comex previously had merger talks with the New York Metal Exchange, which came to nothing. 'There have been so many false alarms in the past that I will believe it only when they finally sign the merger documents,' said one trader. The LME believes it can look forward to substantial growth in the US because that country accounts for about 25 per cent of the world's non-ferrous base metals activity but only 15 per cent of LME business. 'So, in the absence of other factors, there is obvious scope for business growth,' Mr King pointed out. At present the only competition the LME faces in the US is from the Comex copper contract and, when the first LME-authorised warehouses in the States started operating a year ago, copper was excluded so as not to challenge this contract. Comex's is a dollar contract whereas copper is traded in sterling in the LME 'ring' and the situation occasionally presents arbitrage opportunities to LME traders. However, recent turbulence in the currency markets caused a change of heart among London-based traders so the LME copper contract will next July switch to dollars. This move increased pressure from some members for the LME to establish copper warehouses in the US, which they see as an important step towards winning more North American copper hedging business away from Comex. Mr King was scheduled to outline the LME's reconsidered policy about US copper warehouses when world industry representatives gather at American Metal Market's 'copper week' in New York in mid-February. He may have to rewrite his script.</p>

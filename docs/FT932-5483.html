			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Lower Lloyd's income cuts Sturge to Pounds 0.3m A DECLINE in fee income from its Lloyd's agencies cut interim pre-tax profits at Sturge Holdings from Pounds 2.58m to Pounds 325,000 in the six months to March 31. The fall in fee income was due to a reduction in the amount of insurance capacity managed by Sturge in 1993 and was only partially compensated for by a rise in income at Wise Speke, the stockbroking subsidiary. Fee and commission income from insurance fell to Pounds 7.77m (Pounds 7.85m), producing operating losses of Pounds 1.99m (Pounds 813,000 profit). Income from stockbroking rose to Pounds 6.33m (Pounds 4.36m), leaving an operating profit of Pounds 951,000 (Pounds 11,000). Expenses, however, jumped to Pounds 15.1m (Pounds 11.4m), reflecting the inclusion of start-up costs for Sturge's run-off subsidiary and new European operations, as well as higher expenditure by Wise Speke. Operating losses of Pounds 1.04m (Pounds 802,000 profit) were offset by a fall in interest and other income to Pounds 1.36m against Pounds 1.78m. Earnings per share fell to 0.4p (3.4p) and a reduced dividend of 1p (2.75p) was declared. Mr David Coleridge, chairman, said the group's fortunes reflected the problems of the insurance market, describing recent underwriting losses as 'truly horrific.' Nevertheless, 11 of Sturge's 22 syndicates reported profits in the 1990 year of account, despite projected losses for the market as a whole of between Pounds 2.5bn to Pounds 2.8bn. Profit commission, expected to amount to about Pounds 4m in the second half, will be reflected in the full-year results. Overall, Sturge's syndicates will still lose an amount equivalent to 21 per cent of their stamp capacity, said Mr Terry Hayday, chief executive.</p>

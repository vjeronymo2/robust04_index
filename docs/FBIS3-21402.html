However, in an interview with AL-HAYAH, he  explained that the Palestinian economy is tied in with the  Israeli economy, and they cannot be separated at the present  time. The hope is that the Palestinian economy will become an  independent economy in the future.    Al-Natshah said that Arab economic unity would be encouraged  and not Middle Eastern economic unity, because that would  include Israel and other countries. He mentioned that world  trade and industrial delegations have visited the West Bank and  Gaza Strip to study future investment opportunities in the  autonomous areas. "However, we would prefer future investments  to be Arab." He added that the initial numbers indicate that the  size of investment in the autonomous areas would reach $10  billion. He explained that this figure is not large, in view of  the fact that there is a need for 800,000 housing units in the  Gaza Strip and, possibly, the demand in the West Bank may reach  more than 100,000. With this amount of work, activity will open  up in about 30 professions and will provide jobs for all those  out of work.    Regarding the nature of the investment laws that Arab  investors will be dealing with and whether they will be  Palestinian or Israeli, al-Natshah said: "When autonomy is  applied, Israel will have no connection with these investments.  Laws will be subject to the Palestinian autonomous government."    As to the role of the anticipated normalization process  between the Arab nations and Israel, in places where there are  Arab-Israeli investment agreements coinciding with  Arab-Palestinian agreements, he said that the Palestinian people  are not unanimously agreed regarding the autonomy agreement. "I  am one of those who oppose it, but autonomy will be applied  because it was imposed by the United States. Ideologically, I  would not encourage any form of normalization, because the Jews  dream of reaching all Arab countries on the backs of the  Palestinian people."    He said that, at the present time, the Palestinian people  suffer from economic pressure because the Israeli authorities  have imposed a security cordon around the West Bank and Gaza  Strip since last March, referring to the fact that before work  started on this measure, there were 250,000 Palestinians working  in Israel, including 120,000 who used to work legally. He  explained that Palestinian citizens from the West Bank and Gaza  Strip could only enter Israel with a permit, "but permits have  only been granted to 35,000 workers so far. This means that  there are about 21,000 workers who are mostly unemployed."    Al-Natshah said that industry in Hebron constitutes about 50  percent of West Bank industry, which includes, for example, the  shoe industry. In addition, 90 percent of West Bank production  is in building stone, ceramics, glass, and canned food. "We  expect to give future incentives for the export of products to  Arab nations, since exporting at present is limited to a very  few products to Jordan. We used to export to certain Arab Gulf  states."    Al-Natshah advised that Israeli officials have rejected a  request submitted by a group of businessmen in the West Bank to  provide them with a license to open an Islamic Palestinian bank,  capitalized at $10 million. He added: "We hope that the  Palestinian government will agree to open this bank, since the  Cairo-Amman Bank is now subject to the Jordanian Central Bank,  as well as the Israeli Central Bank. The Bank of Palestine is  subject to the Israeli Central Bank."    He pointed out that the Federation of Palestinian Chambers  of  Commerce is made up of 13 Chambers of Commerce, which meet  periodically. He said that the population of Hebron totals  300,000, with some 3,000 merchants participating in the Chamber  of Commerce.</p>

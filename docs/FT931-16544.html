			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / Seducer eyes a double prize: Boeing's approach to Airbus partners The future of Europe's most successful cross-border industrial partnership is under threat. By luring two of the main partners in the European Airbus consortium to study the joint Dollars 10bn development of a new 550-800 seat super jumbo airliner, Boeing is attempting to consolidate its own global dominance of the civil aircraft market by driving a wedge between the four Airbus shareholders. The US company, which controls a 55-60 per cent share of the world airliner market, yesterday confirmed it was close to signing an agreement with Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa) and possibly also with British Aerospace - two of the four Airbus partners, which also include Aerospatiale of France and Casa of Spain - to study the development of a super jumbo. Although Airbus officials sought to play down the implications of the Boeing move by suggesting discussions with Dasa and BAe were only at an 'exploratory stage', the outcome of any agreement is bound to have a profound impact on the European aircraft industry. It could lead to a radical realignment of the entire commercial aerospace sector. 'Boeing is clearly trying to seduce some of the Airbus partners with strong north American aspirations in an effort to destabilise the consortium which has now become its main competitor,' said an executive of one Airbus partner. Mr John Hayhurst, vice-president of large aircraft development at Boeing, said the Seattle company had initiated discussions with Dasa over the super jumbo last year. Boeing is also discussing future supersonic aircraft development with the German company, part of the Daimler-Benz group, and has already agreed to exchange some engineers with Dasa. Mr Jean Pierson, the Airbus chief executive, is expected to warn his partners today, during his traditional new year presentation of the consortium's prospects, of the risks of undermining Airbus at a particularly delicate stage in its evolution. Over the past 20 years, Airbus has developed a broad family of aircraft, has captured 26 per cent of the world market, and is now starting to make inroads in the big long-distance airliner market, traditionally dominated by the Boeing 747, with its new A330/A340 widebody jets which will be delivered to their first airline customers later this year. But if some of the Airbus partners are tempted into joint development projects with Boeing, it could seriously undermine Airbus's own longer-term aircraft development projects. Airbus, like Boeing, has also been studying the development of a 600-seat jumbo. It has already approached the big three Japanese aerospace manufacturers - Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Fuji Heavy Industries, and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries - to become risk-sharing partners in a super jumbo project. 'The design and development of this giant aircraft represents the next big challenge in commercial aviation,' said Mr Adam Brown, the Airbus director of planning. The biggest demand for such an aircraft will come from the fast-growing Asia-Pacific air transport market, according to Mr Brown, making it all the more attractive for Japanese and other Asian manufacturers to participate in the studies and development of a super jumbo. Both Airbus and Boeing believe such an aircraft could be in regular airline service early next century. The problem for Airbus is not only that it is having to adapt to the recession in the airliner market, scaling back production and rescheduling aircraft deliveries of financially strapped airline and leasing company customers. It is also contending with the conflicting ambitions of its partner companies and their national governments. The current system on which the consortium is based - a French partnership called 'Groupement d'Interest Economique' (GIE) - has also made it more difficult for Airbus to control its own future as all strategic decisions must first be approved by a supervisory board of representatives of the four partner companies. Plans to transform Airbus into a public limited company have been put on ice. But the latest strategic manoeuvres in the industry could now renew the impetus for such a change. Boeing's move is not the first time US manufacturers have sought to unsettle European efforts to establish a strong commercial aerospace industry. Since the 1960s, US companies have regularly offered to co-operate with European manufacturers whenever the Europeans have sought to develop a new aircraft product. When in the 1960s Sud-Aviation, now part of the French Aerospatiale group, was considering developing the Caravelle, McDonnell Douglas discussed co-operation but went on to develop its own, and much more successful DC-9 jet. When Airbus was planning to develop a shorter version of its A300 widebody jet in the 1970s, Boeing tried to persuade British Aerospace to co-operate in development of its 757 twin-engine airliner. Like Airbus, Boeing is not in a position to develop on its own a new double-decker super jumbo aircraft at a cost of Dollars 10bn or more. The US manufacturer is currently in the process of developing a new widebody aircraft, the 777, and is also addressing the issue of renewing other products in its range. These include the smaller 737 narrowbody jet which competes against the newer Airbus A320. Boeing has relied on the big three Japanese manufacturers as important partners on projects such as the 777 and the 767. But Boeing, which has also discussed Japanese participation in its super jumbo feasibility studies, has been reluctant to give the Japanese companies an equity or profit-sharing role in its programmes. Boeing has clearly been unhappy over Airbus attempts to forge a close relationship with the Japanese manufacturers. Boeing's Mr Hayhurst believes there will be room for only one super jumbo programme. By attempting to secure the support of both Dasa and BAe, two companies keen on expanding their presence in the US, Boeing is seeking to steal a march on its European rival. It has timed its move carefully and cunningly, taking advantage of a moment when moves towards greater European political and economic unity are under strain and the European aerospace industry is undergoing a new restructuring phase. The fact that two of the four Airbus partners are even considering collaboration with Boeing is a sign that the Airbus partnership may be starting to waver.</p>

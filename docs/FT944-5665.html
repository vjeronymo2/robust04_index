			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor (1): British Gas salaries defence a bit rich Sir, The chairman of British Gas gives a cogent explanation (Letters, December 1) for the chief executive's pay rise, and in a free society we have to accept that people are paid what they can get - but surely what is unacceptable is the simultaneous squeeze on the lower paid. That is largely the fault of the government's taxation policy which has not only widened the gap between the better off and the worse off, but has also depressed the living standards of the latter. This I believe to be indefensible and I have yet to hear in defence of it a voice even from the brazen Tory right wing.

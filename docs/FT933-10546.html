			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / Early British Coal sell-off planned: DTI wants company split before sale to private sector INDUSTRY ministers want to privatise the bulk of British Coal by as early as next July. The sale is likely to break it up into at least two separate companies. Ministers also prefer 'trade sales' to other existing companies to a flotation on the stock exchange, largely because this would be more likely to lead to the replacement of existing management with private-sector managers. There are also strong doubts about the public's willingness to buy shares in such a controversial privatisation. The industry had expected British Coal to stay in the public sector at least until early 1995. Although ministers have yet to decide finally on a break-up, they are strongly influenced by the privatisations of the gas and electricity generating industries, where the creation of a monopoly and duopoly respectively caused considerable controversy. British Coal will counter that splitting up the industry would weaken its bargaining power with the electricity generators which are its main customers. The Department of Trade and Industry's preferred timetable would entail a bill being presented to the House of Commons shortly after it re-assembles in October and a second reading before Christmas. That would open up the possibility that the bill could be given royal assent and the main parts of British Coal sold next July. The timetable has yet to be accepted by the cabinet. But one argument in favour is that it places as much time as possible between the controversial sale and the next general election. Even if the fast-track timetable is approved, large parts of British Coal would remain in the public sector for months or even years. Ministers have accepted the need for a residual body, possibly retaining the British Coal title. This would run some pits while it was determined whether there was a market for their output. There may be several pits in that category. Most industry analysts expect the decline in the market to leave only about 15 of the 30 remaining pits with a long-term future. But the government could have difficulty closing the other 15 by the middle of next year, given the public outcry its last closure plans created. The residual body would also be in charge of most of the corporation's Pounds 3bn of liabilities, including those for subsidence and concessionary coal for former employees. Ministers' preference for splitting British Coal could allow them to satisfy the demands of Mining Scotland, an influential lobby group which wants all interests of the corporation north of the border to be hived off into a separate company, and has set up a company to buy them. The bulk of the corporation in England and Wales could easily be divided into two organisations, one based in the Midlands and the other in Yorkshire, which the corporation is bringing into being through a restructuring already under way. It is possible, however, that the two organisations could be split further. Isolated mines such as Ellington in Northumberland and Tower in Wales may be sold off separately, although their future seems less secure than the pits in the Midlands and Yorkshire. Mr Robin Cook, the shadow trade and industry secretary, said last night that Labour would fight any plans to privatise the coal industry. Gas stations backed, Page 5 Lex, Page 14</p>

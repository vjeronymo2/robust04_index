			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / International Company News: Kittaka seeks court protection KITTAKA, a Japanese chain store operator, has filed for protection under the bankruptcy law, becoming the second convenience store operator to seek court protection in the past three months. Unlike other retailers, Japan's convenience stores have held up well against a background of sharp falls in consumer spending. However, increasing competition and poor summer weather have started to hurt some convenience store operators. Although not stock market listed, Kittaka's Kei-Mart convenience store chain is one of the large scale national chains, with 1,098 outlets. According to Teikoku Databank, a private credit research agency, the company has liabilities totalling Y33bn (Dollars 317m). Teikoku said Kittaka suffered from intensive competition. In July, Niko Mart, also an unlisted convenience store chain, filed for court protection after expanding its operations too quickly. Meanwhile, two leading supermarkets have revised down their profit estimates following a long rainy season and an unusually cool summer. Ito-Yokado, said annual pre-tax profits would remain flat at Y97.5bn rather than a 2 per cent rise to Y99.5bn, while Nichii expects annual pre-tax profits to fall 17 per cent to Y20bn rather than a 4 per cent increase to Y25.2bn.</p>

			<p><P> June 2, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MOLINA JOINS BERNARDI IN 1-BLOCK WALK OF PRECINCT  </P> <P> Councilwoman Gloria Molina walked a block in a Latino area of Pacoima Thursday,  introducing her colleague Councilman Ernani Bernardi to potential voters.  </P> <P> Switching easily from Spanish to English, Molina -- who represents East Los  Angeles -- urged them to vote for Bernardi, who faces a runoff Tuesday against  Los Angeles city Fire Department Capt. Lyle Hall.  </P> <P> "He is important to our community. He pays attention to the community," Molina  said.  </P> <P> But inhabitants of the seven houses the politicians visited along Mercer Street  needed no convincing. Precinct workers had canvassed the neighborhood earlier  in the day and most of the residents answered their doors wearing Bernardi  T-shirts.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Absentee Ballot  </P> <P> "I already sent my vote yesterday," said John Aguinaga, who completed an  absentee ballot.  </P> <P> "I'm very satisfied with Mr. Bernardi," said his wife, Mary.  </P> <P> One woman asked Molina if Bernardi spoke Spanish too and seemed disappointed to  learn that he did not. But Bernardi, 77, reassured her that he is a fellow  Latin: "Italian," he said, pointing to his chest.  </P> <P> When the television cameras left 15 minutes after the precinct walk began,  Molina and Bernardi called it quits and returned to the Mercer-Haddon  Homeowners Assn. headquarters for punch and cake.  </P> <P> Molina said she backs Bernardi because he is one of the few council members who  understands the issues important to her district, such as low-income housing,  increased police protection and the need to remove abandoned cars and graffiti.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Frequent Allies  </P> <P> Since Molina's election in 1987, the two have often voted together in the  council. "A lot of the others have gotten to where they say, 'Oh, here it comes  again' on certain kinds of issues," Molina said. "I think our districts must be  very much alike."  </P> <P> Molina and Councilman Marvin Braude, who with his wife contributed $1,000 to  Bernardi's reelection campaign, are the only members of the council who have  actively supported the incumbent.  </P> <P> Hall's campaign was preparing Thursday for a precinct walk in the 7th District  on Saturday that is scheduled to include former governor Jerry Brown, now  chairman of the state Democratic Party; Los Angeles City Controller Rick  Tuttle; state Assemblyman Richard Floyd (D-Carson); and state Sen. Art Torres  (D-Los Angeles).  </P> <P> Dolores Huerta, vice president of the United Farm Workers of America, plans to  sponsor a free menudo breakfast in Pacoima for Hall Saturday morning and then  join the precinct walk, organizers said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Latinos' Endorsements  </P> <P> Both candidates have been endorsed by some local Latino leaders and Hall also  won endorsements from state and national Latino politicians, including Torres  and Rep. Matthew Martinez (D-Monterey Park).  </P> <P> Earlier in the day, Bernardi picked up additional Latino backing from a  coalition of six civic groups called the "Latino Justice-Public Safety  Political Endorsing Convention." At a City Hall press conference, group leaders  said they believe Bernardi will be responsive to issues that affect Latinos  such as crime and immigrant rights.  </P> <P> Both Bernardi and Hall were interviewed by representatives of the group May 20.  The same coalition, which represents about 3,000 Los Angeles-area Latinos who  work as attorneys, prison and jail guards and police, had endorsed Irene Tovar  for the April primary race.  </P> <P> The 1,000-member Latino Law Enforcement Assn., of which 800 members are Los  Angeles Police Department officers, are included in the group.  </P> <P> Hall, however -- who is a former president of the firefighters' union and has  strong support among labor unions -- holds the endorsement of the Los Angeles  Police Protective League.  </P></p>

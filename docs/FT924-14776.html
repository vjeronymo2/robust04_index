			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Accountancy Column: Municipal Mutual and the insolvency quagmire THE FINANCIAL troubles of Municipal Mutual, the company which insures nine out of 10 local authorities and many individuals, have once more brought the spotlight on to the need for urgent reform of insolvency legislation. While policyholders - as well the beneficiaries of local government services and poll tax payers around the UK - are watching for the immediate outcome of negotiations with MMI over its future, MMI's problems have emphasised how greater attention should be paid to the wider framework within which the insurance business operates. Every recent case of an insurance company experiencing difficulties has powerfully illustrated the argument for reform. Two issues in particular need to be addressed: the tools used by regulators to scrutinise corporate financial health, and insolvency procedures available when a company is unable to continue operating. One of the most immediate concerns for MMI's creditors - stoked by criticism from the Labour party - is the role of the Department of Trade and Industry. As the regulator of insurance companies, should it have intervened more vigorously when signs of trouble first emerged? MMI's difficulties did not come as a surprise. A heavily qualified audit report in the accounts for the year to December 31 last year, which was issued this July, showed clearly that the company had fallen below the statutory minimum solvency margin. The message resounded among MMI's leading creditors, represented by the Association of Metropolitan Authorities, Association of District Councils, Association of County Councils and the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities. These organisations hired accountants at Touche Ross to investigate. Touche Ross's report issued at the end of September concluded: 'There is a strong possibility that MMI will cease trading in the very near future and be placed in some form of insolvency proceedings  .. We recommend that the associations advise members to seek alternative cover when policies are due for renewal.' The DTI was clearly not in the dark either. It said last week that it had been in discussions with the directors of MMI over the future of the company at least as far back as March. It held back from using its powers to request a winding-up petition. Criteria used by the DTI for assessing viability are somewhat opaque. They include a series of qualitative as well as quantitative measures such as profitability, liquidity and strength of setting aside reserves against future claims. Fundamental and enshrined in law, however, is the solvency margin, which is defined as the ratio of a company's net assets (its capital and free reserves) to the amount of premium income received in a given year. It measures the ability to pay claims. The DTI stresses that there is no single magic figure for the ratio below which it will act. Legislation - notably the 1982 Insurance Act - lays down specific formulas by which it can be calculated for different companies. Officials say they might normally be content if the figure is twice the 16 per cent minimum set down in EC regulations. The solvency ratio is also widely used by brokers and analysts. But many are becoming disillusioned with its effectiveness. It ought to be a proxy for the scale of risk being assumed. The stronger a company's capital base, the less the chance of it being unable to pay claims and the more insurance it can sell. Yet that was no help in assessing Trinity Insurance, for example, which had a very high solvency margin and yet still became insolvent earlier this year. The ratio's limitations include the fact that it does not measure the level and adequacy of claims reserves. It takes no account of the level of risk involved. Paradoxically, increasing premiums could reduce the ratio, while cutting premiums to uneconomic levels would increase it. The ratio does not show the strength of a company's financial base, the details of its reinsurance arrangements, the type of insurance it underwrote, or the size of its management expenses. Finally, assessments of the lowest acceptable level of solvency vary between regulators and the market, as well as over time. As a result, using the ratio is fraught with difficulties. A more fundamental problem is that the DTI's powers as a regulator are limited. If an insurance company breaches its solvency margin, all the department can ultimately do to petition the court via the secretary of state to appoint liquidators. There is little flexibility between that extreme and simply continuing discussions with a stricken company. That raises a wider point about the nature of insolvency proceedings for insurance companies. The existing law is not compatible with the structure of the sector, at least as far as non-life companies with 'long-tail' business are concerned. A whole series of difficulties arise if a insurance company is liquidated. There are legal disputes about whether reinsurers have to pay claims to such a company in full. The insurance market is disrupted. Policyholders experience lengthy, costly and tortuous procedures. Perhaps most important, it takes many years before creditors can be paid. It is impossible to pay out until all liabilities are established. These rise regularly as actuaries adjust future claims each time new legal settlements occur. Meanwhile, insolvency practitioners are reluctant to pay out interim dividends since they are personally liable if they over-estimate the amount to be paid out. There are two intermediate solutions. An informal scheme of arrangement, or a formal scheme under Section 425 of the 1985 Companies Act, would allow a more orderly run-off of existing insurance business with claims being paid as they arise. But such negotiations are extremely delicate and time-consuming. A formal scheme requires support from at least 75 per cent of creditors by value. The first example of such a formal scheme, applied in the case of a small company called Monument Re., has only just been approved after nine months of discussions. Reptition on a larger scale will not prove easy. The directors of Walbrook, the insurance and reinsurance company with gross liabilities of more than Dollars 2bn, attempted to put together an innovative informal scheme in July with its leading creditors. But they refused to co-operate, and the company is now in a formal scheme with liquidators appointed. With MMI, the challenge could be equally great, given that the company will have to cope with claims from more than one million individual and local authority policyholders. The logical alternative - which was made possible under the 1986 insolvency act - is administration, the nearest UK equivalent to Chapter 11 in the USA. That would grant the company protection against its creditors, and give it time to re-organise in an attempt to continue operating. Yet for unknown reasons, the insolvency act specifically excluded insurance companies from eligibility. Administration still has limitations. As currently drafted, only two of its four strategies are feasible for insurers: a formal or an informal scheme of arrangement. Mr Colin Bird, an insolvency partner at Price Waterhouse, has recently been discussing changes to the law with the DTI which would introduce a fifth approach. Mr Bird and a number of his colleagues would like to see the DTI able to impose insolvency proceedings which would allow run-off to take place. That would allow the practitioners taking control of a company to pay at least a proportion of claims as they arise, and give a quicker and less expensive solution for creditors. Without change in legislation, there can be little assurance for creditors to insolvent insurers.</p>

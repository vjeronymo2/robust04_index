			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Luiz Orlando Carneiro] </F>   [Text] Brasilia -- At the end of his five-day visit to the  PRC on 5 April, Foreign Minister Celso Amorim said Brazilian-PRC  relations have reached the dimension of "strategic partnership."  Amorim was received by President Jiang Zemin and vice premier  and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, among several other  high-ranking Chinese officials. He negotiated an agreement on  principles about aerospace cooperation, which will be signed by  President Itamar Franco in May during his official visit to  Beijing.    One of Minister Amorim's most fruitful meetings was the one  with Wang Zhongyu, minister in charge of the state Economic and  Trade Commission. Zhongyu showed special interest in a joint  venture [two preceding words in English] project at Carajas  [Para State]. The project involves the construction of a  deep-water port in the PRC with the capacity to receive large  cargo (300,000 metric tons) vessels. Minister Wang also showed  interest in Minister Amorim's request that special attention be  given to Brazilian companies' desire to participate in PRC  biddings in the areas of infrastructure and telephone systems.    Brazil and the PRC, which are celebrating the 20th  anniversary of their diplomatic relations' resumption, are  intensifying cooperation in the scientific and technological  fields. Brazil proposed the reactivation of the bilateral  agreement for cooperation in the nuclear field, which was signed  in 1984, and reiterated the importance of the project for the  construction of ground observation satellites (CBERS  [China-Brazil Earth Resources Satellite] Program).</p>

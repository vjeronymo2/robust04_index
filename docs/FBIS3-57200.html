Gaydar said the present exchange rate is being artificially  maintained in the country.    "In December the Central Bank of Russia intervened with its  own currency resources to prevent the ruble from plummeting,"  Gaydar said. "The main factor which determined the favourable  dynamics of the ruble exchange rate consisted in a combination  of high interest rates against the low pace of the money mass  growth and relatively low inflationary anticipation," he said.    One component of this situation is no longer there since the  inflation anticipation has skyrocketed. "If the second component  -- the low pace of the money mass growth -- collapses, the  dollar exchange rate will keep jumping from time to time,"  Gaydar said. But if the government departs from a tough credit  and monetary policy, the drop in the ruble exchange rate can  become a dramatic long-term factor of the Russian economy, he  said.    "I think one should be very prudent about attempts at  maintaining the ruble exchange rate by copious currency  interventions," Gaydar said. "It was very hard for us accumulate  official state reserves starting from scratch in 1992 to 4.5  billion dollars. It would be too dangerous and irresponsible to  squander them within a few days," Gaydar warned.</p>

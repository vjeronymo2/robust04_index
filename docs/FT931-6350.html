			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Letter: The dangers of stereotypes Sir, While it may seem mean-spirited, I think you will find that most of your Irish readers would object to your characterisation of Brian Mulroney ('Irish charm turns sour on Mulroney', February 25) as an 'Irish charmer'. Look at it this way - while you would perhaps be comfortable attributing a stereotypically British characteristic (for instance, 'stiff upper lip') to a politician of British origin, you would think again before headlining Jesse Jackson's or Nelson Mandela's 'sense of rhythm'. Innocent as it may seem, your Irish charmer label is in fact a stereotype, with more negative images, such as the usual 'tendency towards exaggeration' (which was included in the same article), never far away. Brian McNamara, Washington DC, US</p>

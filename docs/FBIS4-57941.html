			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Port-au-Prince, 26 May (AFP) -- On Thursday,  President Emile Jonassaint's provisional government, which is  not recognized by the international community, reported that  unidentified foreign diplomats are "interfering" in Haitian  affairs.    Diplomats, posted to Port-au-Prince, "insultingly and  scandalously interfere in the internal affairs of the Haitian  State," according to a Foreign Ministry communique, which  expresses its "bitterness and absolute indignation" at these  "intolerable deviations."    According to observers, the complaint refers in particular  to  U.S. Ambassador William Swing and his spokesman, Stanley  Schrager. On Thursday, the U.S. Embassy in Haiti strongly  condemned the assassination of four opposition members by armed  men between Sunday evening and Monday morning in Cite Soleil,  the largest shantytown in Port-au-Prince.

During two and a half hours of talks, Hata said Japan  welcomes the recent agreement by the North Koreans to allow some  inspections, the official said.    Qian was quoted as saying China also welcomed the new  development, adding China expects the problem to be solved  rapidly in order to keep peace and stability in Northeast Asia,  he said.    Hata, concurrently deputy prime minister, told Qian that  Japan expects more transparency in China's military development  and indicated that human rights improvements in China would be  conducive to better Sino-U.S. relations.    The spokesman said Hata, who arrived earlier in the day for  a  two-day visit, also took a stand on nuclear weapons  proliferation and urged China to abide by the Missile Technology  Control Regime, which aims at preventing proliferation of  ballistic missile technology.    The Chinese side said they would actively participate in a  total ban on nuclear weapons, a nuclear test ban treaty, the  Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and would register their  conventional weapons with the United Nations, he said.    Qian, also vice premier, expressed concerns over recent  relations between Japan and Taiwan.    Hata said there would be no change in Japan's policy toward  Taiwan, and that Japan would continue to abide by the 1972  Japanese- Chinese Joint Communique in which Japan recognized  China as sole legitimate government.    Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry has  recently sent high-level officials to Taiwan in order to service  an expected 13 billion dollar trade surplus with the island  territory in 1993.    Qian said Vice Premier Zhu Rongji, known as China's economic  czar, will visit Japan in February.    An invitation was also extended to President Jiang Zemin,  but  no date was set, the Japanese official said.    Qian strongly requested a visit to China by Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa, with the Japanese side expressing hope that a  visit will be made at an early stage, but no date was fixed, the  spokesman said.    The Japanese side proposed dividing loan periods from five  years to three-year and two-year periods beginning with the 1996  fiscal year, with yearly reviews in accordance with the  principles of the official development assistance, the official  said.    Qian basically accepted the new arrangement, while saying  China appreciated both Japan's contribution to Chinese economic  development as well as the new arrangement for the loans.    Qian also agreed to yearly reviews of projects involving the  Japanese loans, the official said.    Japan has extended yen-denominated loans to China under  five-  and six-year programs since 1979, with 528.2 billion yen loaned  out in the 1990 to 1995 period covering 42 Chinese projects.</p>

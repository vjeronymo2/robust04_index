			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / Hopes for facility to aid reform THE International Monetary Fund will seek approval for two measures to support developing and former communist economies at its annual meeting this month. But it is likely to move forward on only one. The IMF hopes progress will be made towards agreeing the financing of a new 'structural adjustment' facility to help low-income developing countries carry out market-oriented economic reform programmes. But Fund plans for a modest allocation to members of its own reserve asset, the Special Drawing Right, are expected to fall foul of a US veto and opposition from other leading industrial countries, including Germany and possibly Britain. The IMF wants a SDR36bn (Dollars 51bn/Pounds 33bn) allocation that would bolster the international reserves of developing and former communist nations. Officials argue that it would stimulate world trade, restore the share of the SDR in global reserves to the 5.3 per cent average of the years between 1971 and 1991 and remove an inequity: 38 members have joined the Fund since the last allocation of SDRs and so never benefited from such a boost to their financial resources. Both matters are due to be discussed at a meeting of the IMF's policy-making Interim Committee on September 26, ahead of the formal three-day meeting of the IMF and World Bank that begins in Washington two days later. In its annual report, published yesterday, the IMF said its board of directors reached broad agreement that a new structural adjustment facility worth SDR6bn should be provided to replace the existing Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) which expires at the end of November. The ESAF, which has provided funds at subsidised interest rates of 0.5 per cent to 19 poor developing nations, was judged to have been a success. However, with virtually all industrialised countries experiencing budgetary constraint, differences exist on how to finance a successor to the ESAF. A suggestion, put forward by Britain's former chancellor, Mr Norman Lamont, that the IMF should sell some of its gold holdings to finance a new ESAF appears to have been dropped.</p>

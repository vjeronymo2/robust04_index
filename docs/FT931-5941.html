			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / Sweden rules out Ecu peg SWEDEN'S central bank governor yesterday ruled out pegging the krona to the European currency unit in favour of linking it to the D-Mark or entering the European exchange rate mechanism once Sweden became a member of the European Community, writes Karen Fossli in Oslo. Sweden, along with Norway and Finland, has applied to join the EC and hopes to become a member by 1995. Sweden uncoupled the krona from the Ecu on November 19 and the currency has since been devalued by about 20 per cent. The krona was floated after a failed attempt to maintain the Ecu link, including an increase by the central bank in the key overnight lending rate to 500 per cent.</p>

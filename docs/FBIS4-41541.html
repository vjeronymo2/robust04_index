			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Candidate of Juridical Sciences Vladimir Osin, </F> Associate of the Russian Federation Interior Ministry All-Union  Scientific Research Institute, under the "Edict Adopted. What  Next?" rubric: "Emergency Measures Against Bandits"]    [Text] The Russian Federation president's edict "On Urgent  Measures To Protect the Population Against Banditry and Other  Manifestations of Organized Crime" has produced conflicting  assessments among both scientists and practical workers of the  law enforcement agencies. It is perceived by some as a  long-awaited measure which will immediately help to combat  various criminal groups, whereas in others it inspires a fear of  arbitrary rule by the authorities. To arrive at a correct  verdict on the extraordinary measures planned by the president  for combatting manifestations of organized crime it is necessary  to look at the possible consequences, both positive and  negative, of their implementation.    The crime situation in Russia has begun to deteriorate  sharply in recent months. Showdowns among criminals in the big  cities are increasingly resembling military operations.    Meanwhile, the prevailing law enforcement practice and the  conflicting nature of the norms of the existing criminal and  criminal-procedural legislation are not always conducive to  exposing criminal organizations. The many months of work by  operational subunits often end in the conviction only of those  who actually commit a specific offense. The article in our  Criminal Code envisaging liability for banditry (Article 77 of  the Russian Federation Criminal Code) never really did work, and  it is still being applied only in very rare instances.    Furthermore, the Russian Federation Supreme Court's rulings  on the application of this article have simply made it harder to  qualify bandit attacks. That is why the courts are continuing  to qualify an act committed by a gang as an act of theft,  robbery, extortion, or murder by a group.    Nor does the draft law "On the Struggle Against Organized  Crime," which is being prepared by a State Duma committee,  inspire hope. This draft law does not take into account the  existing legal system in Russia or the principles and provisions  characteristic of a rule of law state.    Is this not reason enough to understand the urgent need for  the adoption of emergency legal measures by the Russian  president?    Everyone who speaks out against the edict should note that  it  does not replace the existing legislation but merely gives the  operational services greater scope for gathering information not  about individual crimes but primarily about criminal groups.    The only deviation from the rules laid down by procedural  law  is in regard to those crimes typically committed by gangs or  other forms of organized criminal group suspected of committing  serious crimes.    Prior to the edict the existing law not only did not oblige  but did not even encourage the law enforcement agencies to try  to expose a criminal organization. The edict, however, directs  the operational services precisely toward exposing criminal  organizations. For that purpose alone is it permissible, prior  to the institution of criminal proceedings, to carry out expert  appraisals and hold preliminary investigations into the  financial and economic activity and the property and financial  status not only of suspected persons but also of those close to  them.    Such harsh deviations from citizens' democratic rights and  freedoms enshrined in the Russian Federation Constitution are  dictated by the need to protect Russia's citizens from the orgy  of crime. Such actions, incidentally, are characteristic of any  democratic state which is compelled to fight organized crime.    The edict stipulates the use of the emergency measures  powers  only when there is sufficient evidence of an individual's  involvement in a gang or other organized criminal group which is  justifiably suspected of having committed serious crimes and not  just any crime. The use of the emergency measures on other  grounds must be viewed as an abuse of power or an offense  against justice.    Mistakes are possible, of course, as is the deliberate abuse  of the norms of the edict in a number of cases. But the  institution of prosecutor's oversight exists for that purpose.  The edict clearly prescribes that all emergency measures must  be coordinated with the Prosecutor's Office.    Each instance of an operational investigation into an  individual's involvement in a gang or other organized criminal  group must be recorded and the results of the corresponding work  must be entered in the files of the operational investigation in  question. The materials contained in such files make it  possible to answer the question of whether the implementation of  the emergency measures is legal and necessary.    Every one whose guilt is not proven in the manner prescribed  by law is entitled to receive on demand a report on the nature  of the information pertaining to him. It is possible to appeal  to the court against a refusal to provide such information.  Thus the existing legislation and, in particular, the Law "On  Operational Investigation Activity" provides a guarantee against  excessive use of power by an "overzealous official."    There have been many criticisms of the detention of suspects  and accused persons for a period of up to 30 days. For some  reason, however, people disregard the fact that someone accused  of a serious crime may already be detained in custody for over a  year solely on the grounds of the gravity of the offense  (Article 96 of the Russian Federation Criminal Code). Under the  edict only a suspect's involvement in a gang or other group  suspected of committing a serious offense allows that person to  be kept in custody for up to 30 days.    There is the danger, of course, that these emergency  measures  -- when applied by nonprofessionals, bogus individuals, or  people who like to kick up a fuss about "high-profile cases" --  are a dangerous weapon which could lead to violence on the part  of certain law enforcement agencies, which will undermine still  further the Russian population's faith in them. Thus it would  be advisable to grant such powers only to subunits of the  Federal Counterintelligence Service and the Russian Federation  MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] Main Directorate for  Combatting Organized Crime as the agencies best prepared to  track down and wipe out criminal organizations.    Public opinion would possibly be reassured by being kept  informed about the practical implementation of this edict.    There is one more point which merits the public's attention.  Having been given further scope for combatting manifestations of  organized crime, staffers of the law enforcement agencies must  understand that citizens' patience has already been exhausted.  If those who have been given the task of combatting criminal  organizations cannot make proper use of the emergency powers  granted them by the edict it would be better for them to stand  down. I believe that we will find people who are equal to this  task. So let us assess this work according to its actual  results and not according to some mythical dangers.</p>

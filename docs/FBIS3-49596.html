The restituted land is 5 percent down from  the intended over 50 percent set by the ministry for 1993.    A total of 1,027 land division plans were drawn up by  December 31, 1993. The list of most efficient areas in this  country is headed by northeastern Bulgaria, while southern  Bulgaria ranks last, the deputy agriculture minister said. He  also said that the recent months have witness a speeding up of  this process.    As main stumbling blocks for land restitution the speaker  pinpointed the shortage of jurists and land-use planners in the  land commissions, as well as the belated passage of an act to  regulate the compensation to be granted to the owners who cannot  have back the whole of their land. The land reform cannot be  accomplished unless parliament passes this act, Mr. Stoyanov  stressed.    In case the necessary funds are available, the land reform  can roughly be completed by year's end, Mr. Stoyanov believes.  According to the ministry's estimates, the land reform needs  some 800 million leva, which have been envisaged in the 1994  draft budget. The parliamentary committees are expected to open  the debates on the draft budget as early as this week.</p>

			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Brazilian move reverses coffee rally NEWS THAT Brazil is to sell 600,000 bags of coffee from stock to help finance investment in its industry put this week's rally in coffee prices into reverse. Traders and analysts were sceptical about the announcement as there was no indication of when the sale would take place or at what price. They agreed, however, that it was enough to turn sentiment. London's July robusta contract shed Dollars 19 to close at Dollars 876 a tonne, while in late trading the New York May arabica price was off 1.40 at 58.70 cents a lb. In the first two days of this week the New York May arabica contract rose by more than 6 cents a lb, and touched a high of 61.20 on Wednesday. The London market followed, moving above Dollars 900 a tonne. The main factor behind the move was a fall of 100,000 bags (60 kg each) in US certified stocks - although traders were quick to point out that 5.57m bags of stocks remained. In addition delivery notices against the May contract were well absorbed. As the market rose, fund and commission house buying emerged. Yesterday's reverse followed a Reuter report of a news conference by Mr Celsius Lodder, of the Brazilian Industry Ministry, at which he said the country would invest Dollars 860m in its coffee sector by raising funds through sales from its 17.5m bags of stocks. However, one London analyst said it appeared that Mr Lodder's remarks had been made off the cuff. Such schemes were mentioned every so often as a possibility - 'but I can't see it happening. It would be a bad time to sell off, the harvest is just starting'. Mr Lawrence Eagles of GNI, the London futures brokers, said the quality of the 600,000 bags was unknown. But if they were sold on to Brazil's domestic market, good quality coffee would be released for export. A meeting of the International Coffee Organisation's executive board yesterday was discussing a possible one-year extension to the coffee agreement. A month ago negotations for a new agreement broke down, and members have to decide a future form for the ICO. Several smaller producers are questioning why, with no market support measures in place, the ICO should have a central London office and a staff of about 60.</p>

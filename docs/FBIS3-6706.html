Following the move, the government-backed Housing Loan Corp.  is expected to raise its base housing loan rate from the record  low 3.6 percent per annum to around 4.0 percent, probably  effective late April.    The Fund Management Bureau, which invests public funds from  postal savings and other sources, offers the loans to the  Housing Loan Corp., Japan Road Corp. and other government-backed  organizations.    The base housing loan rate applies to loans for houses with  a  floor space of up to 125 square meters.</p>

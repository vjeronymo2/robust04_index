On the Evening of 16 March, Viktor Cherepkov Was  Relieved of the Position of the Mayor of Vladivostok, and  Konstantin Tolstoshein Was Appointed Acting Mayor"]    [Text] Yesterday's issue of VLADIVOSTOK reported  rumors circulating in the city concerning the inevitable removal  of Viktor Cherepkov on Wednesday, 16 March. Our prediction  turned out to be accurate.    On 16 March, at approximately 1800 hours, Deputy Governors  Igor Lebedinets (the acting supreme official of the kray in view  of Yevgeniy Nazdratenko's attending a meeting of the Federation  Council in Moscow) and Alfred Gartman appeared at the building  of the administration of Vladivostok. They announced the removal  of the mayor of Vladivostok, Viktor Cherepkov, from his position  and the appointment of Konstantin Tolstoshein as the acting head  of the administration of Vladivostok. The latter has previously  held the job of chairman of the committee for industry of the  kray administration, and prior to that--head of the  administration of Pervorechenskiy Rayon of the city.    From this moment on, the events began to develop that were  witnessed by a team of VLADIVOSTOK journalists who worked  between 1800 and 0400 hours in the area of the White and Gray  Houses, as well as Cherepkov's apartment.    Upon returning to his office, Igor Lebedinets informed a  VLADIVOSTOK correspondent that at 1700 hours, Deputy Procurator  of Frunzenskiy Rayon Aleksandr Vysotskiy had signed a decree to  relieve Cherepkov from his position. This document had been  ratified by Kray Procurator Valeriy Vasilenko, as well as  cleared by the kray court. The latter procedure was legally  necessary in view of the fact that Viktor Cherepkov is a  candidate for deputy of the kray duma.    As far as the decree itself is concerned, it said the  following on the basis of the records of criminal case No.  474731 on the charges against V.I. Cherepkov under Article 173,  part 3, of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (taking a  bribe): "V.I. Cherepkov has been charged with accepting from  citizen V.N. Volkov a bribe in a particularly large amount, in  the form of a Swiss-made Omega wristwatch worth 2,762,100 rubles  [R], while working as the head of the Vladivostok  administration, on 6 February 1994, in his official suite No.  1001 at the building of the city administration at 20 Ocean  Avenue, for a positive decision in favor of Volkov concerning  the transfer to him under a lease of premises from the  nonresidential stock of municipal property for an office of the  Vikhr Moscow association of internationalist soldiers. ....On 10  February 1994, V.I. Cherepkov received a bribe in a particularly  large amount from Volkov in the form of R3 million for the  previously rendered service in transferring the office premises  under a lease...."    The document also stresses that it became necessary to  remove  V.I. Cherepkov from his position given that the position held by  him may interfere with establishing the truth in the case.    From 1800 hours on, the building of the city administration  was blockaded by UVD [Internal Affairs Directorate]  functionaries. They began to clear the building of staff  employees and visitors. Some of the latter locked themselves in  their offices, and for this reason some doors were broken down.  The militia also had to break down the door to the mayor's  office, which had prudently been locked from the inside.  Nonetheless, as the spouse of the mayor, Valentina Cherepkova,  and the former city manager Vladimir Gilgenberg testified,  Alfred Gartman, who entered the office first, behaved in an  exceptionally proper manner, stating that he had come there  primarily as a physician.    Between approximately 1800 and 2100 hours, the key  supporters  of Cherepkov--V. Gilgenberg, S. Dolotov, T. Romanenko, S.  Shokolenko, G. Petrachkov, and V. Kalenik--left the building on  a coercively voluntary basis. By this time, no more than 50  people were gathered on the grounds and the steps in front of  the Gray House; half of them were activists of the so-called  "Association of Vladivostok Voters," and half were journalists.  All attempts to break through into the building were stopped by  UVD functionaries who, in the estimation of observers, operated  mainly within the bounds of the law "On the Militia" (including  the use of force to put an end to unlawful actions and actions  interfering with the performance of official duties of the  militia).    At approximately 2130 hours, it became known that the newly  appointed mayor had demanded that V.I. Cherepkov leave the  office and the building by 0030 hours. However, this event  occurred at 0115 hours, when the door swung open, and people in  plainclothes, flanked by a group of baton-wielding militia  functionaries, carried the dismissed mayor out of the building.    The hysterical condition of the elderly admirers of Viktor  Ivanovich, who suspected the worst, rose to its heights. A wild  crush and swarm and shouting ensued--all of this went on for  five to seven minutes, until Cherepkov was placed in an  ambulance, which was immediately cordoned off by a double circle  of OMON [Special Missions Militia Detachment] combatants.  Several minutes later, the wife of the former mayor, who was  holding up quite courageously, got into the car, and the  ambulance moved almost right away in the direction of  Cherepkov's house on Kalinin Street.    Upon arrival at the destination, Galina Gordiyenko, the  physician of the ambulance team who had observed Viktor  Ivanovich for a few of the last hours in the office, stated in a  conversation with a VLADIVOSTOK correspondent that Cherepkov had  a pronounced stress condition and stenocardia. She categorically  denied information disseminated in front of the Gray House  concerning an infarction that the "retiree" had supposedly had.  <H6>  * * * * </H6>   At approximately 2030 on 16 March, City Manager Vladimir  Gilgenberg, by then the former city manager, left the Gray  House. However, he did not do so on his own, but rather with  assistance from militia functionaries. One hour to an hour and a  half later, a VLADIVOSTOK journalist met with Vladimir  Andreyevich among his supporters, next to the building of the  city administration and asked him a few questions.    [Journalist] Has violence been used by the militia against  you?    [Gilgenberg] Of course, I was not beaten up, but I was  driven  out of the office. I was not allowed to remain by the side of  the legitimately elected mayor and was bounced off the premises.    [Journalist] They say that you called Moscow.    [Gilgenberg] Yes. I notified the leadership of the State  Duma; they promised to take up our issue as early as Thursday. I  talked to the leader of one of the factions, but for now I will  not say which one.    [Journalist] Did you foresee the forthcoming events?    [Gilgenberg] Yes, in principle. Backstage scheming had begun  as early as Monday. Incidentally, it was precisely on Monday  that I became acting mayor; after all, Viktor Ivanovich took  sick leave, apparently on account of microfocal myocardial  infarction. The kray administration picked the time quite  fortuitously. Yeltsin was in Sochi, Nazdratenko was in Moscow,  and who was procurator general was altogether unclear.  <H6>  * * * * </H6>   The newspaper VLADIVOSTOK became the first publication to  which the new leader of the city administration, Konstantin  Tolstoshein, gave an interview. This happened at 0300 hours on  17 March.    [Journalist] Konstantin Borisovich, when did you learn about  your appointment?    [Tolstoshein] In all honesty? On Wednesday, at 1730 hours. I  was working at the kray administration (Tolstoshein's previous  position was that of the chairman of the committee for industry  of the kray administration) when it was proposed that I head the  municipality of Vladivostok.    [Journalist] Did you agree right away?    [Tolstoshein] Yes, I did not hesitate any on this point. The  city needs to be rescued. Look what they have done to  Vladivostok-- it is a pain and a shame. There is dirt, lack of  care, the breakdown of the economy and transportation, lack of  social protection for many of the almost 800,000 inhabitants of  the city, and other woes.    [Journalist] What will you work on first of all?    [Tolstoshein] Four areas will have priority: a cleanup in  the  city with the hygiene and disease control service, housing and  communal management, and other subdivisions participating; the  operation of public transportation, especially in conjunction  with the coming of the recreational season; an analysis of the  operation of the committee for property management and  assistance to low- income citizens, families with many children,  veterans of the Great Patriotic War, the war in Afghanistan, and  those in other hot spots. Finally, we should begin preparations  for the forthcoming winter heating season as early as Thursday,  including financing, material and technical supplies, and  solutions to similar problems.    [Journalist] Attention will certainly be paid to personnel  policy, will it not?    [Tolstoshein] It goes without saying. The city  administration  was bloated to an impossible size and, accordingly, wages  claimed a tremendous amount of funds from our budget. We will  emphasize professionals rather than political scientists, disc  jockeys, and historians along with psychics. Some five or six  deputy mayors will remain instead of the current 13, although  nobody intends to make this into a dogma. As early as 2000 hours  on 16 March, I signed a decree on firing the city manager and  similar officials. Knowledgeable people will come to replace  them. For example, Vladimir Terekhov, the chief of the  organization and inspection directorate of the kray  administration, will become a deputy mayor.    The institution of rayons will be restored, with greater  independence being granted to them, but also with greater  requirements. We had to dismiss the old heads appointed by my  predecessor. Viktor Pletnev and Sergey Zhurmilov have returned  to replace them in Pervomayskiy and Leninskiy Rayons. Viktor  Goncharov and Aleksandr Avdeyev have been appointed to  Pervorechenskiy and Frunzenskiy Rayons. For now, Deputy Head of  the Administration Tamara Vadilyeva will discharge the  responsibilities of the head of Sovetskiy Rayon (Sergey Fil is  studying at an academy).    [Journalist] Who put the functionaries of law enforcement  organs at your disposal?    [Tolstoshein] Militia functionaries were provided through  the  channels of the kray and city UVD's. Legality was fully upheld,  especially as far as the removal of the former mayor from his  position is concerned.    [Journalist] Why was City Procurator Vyacheslav Yaroshenko  absent?    [Tolstoshein] I invited him that evening. However, he said  he  was sick and did not show up at the Gray House.    [Journalist] How would you comment on the fact that Viktor  Cherepkov was hand-carried out of the office?    [Tolstoshein] I tried to explain to Viktor Ivanovich and his  wife, Valentina Petrovna, that the office of the head of the  city administration does not belong personally to Cherepkov,  Tolstoshein, Ivanov, or Petrov; it is the place where the mayor  works. If one is sick, he should receive treatment at home or in  the hospital. At first, Valentina Petrovna asked for three  hours, and then until the morning. An ambulance had to be called  three times.    In summation, I would like to say that the time of political  demarches and a confrontation between the city administration  and the kray administration is over. The time of tedious work  has begun.</p>

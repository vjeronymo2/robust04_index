			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Pierre Langereux: "ESA Proposes Compromise"] </F>   [Text] France and Germany will have to make up most of the  budgetary shortfall resulting from currency devaluations in  Spain, Italy, and the United Kingdom. Ministers of the member  states are supposed to announce their decisions between now and  mid-February.    The European Space Agency [ESA] failed to reach agreement,  at  the 31 January meeting of the agency council, on retroactive  adjustments to all mandatory and optional member-state  contributions to the Agency's programs. This annual adjustment  exercise is needed in order to compensate, after the fact, for  the inevitable fluctuation of exchange rates between the time  that contribution levels were established and the date when  member-state payments were actually converted (into ECU, or  European Counting Units). It is precisely the conversion to  European money that poses problems for several member states,  owing to the major devaluation of their currencies last year  against the ECU, ESA's sole currency of reference.    At the earlier council meeting of 18 January, the Agency had  set the end of the month as a deadline for resolving the  question, in order to be able to effectively continue its  general operations and launch the new manned flight programs  (Columbus and MSTP [Manned Space Transport Program], which were  approved after differences between Paris and Bonn were ironed  out (Cf. A&amp;C No. 1456). But on 31 January, the "compromise  package developed by the Agency's governing council to attenuate  the effects of currency exchange variations and the introduction  of the ECU" turned out to have "gone beyond the mandate of  certain delegations," says Roger Elaerts, ESA spokesman.    Council president Pieter-Gael Winters of the Netherlands  therefore decided to "submit the compromise proposal directly to  the ministers of all member states for their approval," asking  them to "respond before mid-February." And so the 13 member  states (plus Finland and Canada, as associated states) were  given further time in which to agree to this compromise, which  requires additional contributions by the "rich countries" to  compensate for the financial constraints weighing on the "poor  countries."    More precisely, France and Germany (which benefited from a  favorable revaluation of their currencies against the devalued  ones) must increase their financial participation in order to  lighten the burden on the disadvantaged countries--that is, the  countries disadvantaged by the devaluation--namely Spain, Italy,  and the United Kingdom.    So much for the short term, i.e., adjustment of this year's  contributions by means of the Agency's compromise, which if  accepted will imply de facto adoption of all the juridical  language authorizing the start-up of the new Columbus and MSTP  programs. These programs, according to R. Elaerts, have already  been almost fully subscribed since the previous ESA council  meeting.    At the same time, the Agency's compromise proposes a new  financial mechanism for resolving the long-term problem of  fluctuations in ECU exchange rates. The basic idea is to scrap  the current system (of payment in national currencies  subsequently converted into ECU at the Agency) in favor of  direct payments to the Agency in ECU, thus shifting to ESA  member states the onerous task of converting their national  currencies into European money.    It would obviously be desirable--now that Germany has agreed  not to insist on equal parity with France in these programs--to  have a quick resolution of the adjustment issue, which for  several months now has impeded Agency operations, especially  start-up of the manned flight programs. France for its part now  plans to pay for one-fourth of the combined cost of the two  programs--100 million UC [Counting Units] towards MSTP and 24  million UC towards Columbus, whose 1994-1995 budgets are 207 and  270 million UC respectively.  <H5>  Ariane Probe </H5>   On 26 January Arianespace, in conjunction with ESA and CNES  [National Center for Space Studies], established a commission of  inquiry to "establish the causes of the failure of flight 63."  The commission is chaired by Jean-Paul Herteman, deputy  technical director of SNECMA [National Company for the Design  and Building of Aircraft Engines] (France). Vice chairman of the  commission will be Eric Slachmuylders of ESA. The other  commission members are Karl-Helmut Dederra of DASA [German  Aerospace] (Germany), Mauro Varetti of Fiat (Italy), Jean-Paul  Bozet of the University of Liege (Belgium), and Michel Pons of  CNES. The secretariat will consist of Messrs. Thevenot and  Lemoigne of SEP [European Propulsion Company] (France). The team  is supposed to "present its initial conclusions in mid-February"  and "recommend measures to be taken to correct the flaws  identified" as responsible for the premature shutdown of SEP's  HM7B engine. Flight 63 was the fourth of six unsuccessful  Arianes in which the cryogenic propulsion system has been  implicated (Cf. A&amp;C No. 1457).</p>

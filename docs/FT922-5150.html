			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Deeper losses and refinancing at Porth Performance at Porth Group, the USM-quoted Christmas decorations manufacturer, continued to decline over 1991, with turnover down from Pounds 21m to Pounds 17.6m and pre-tax losses deepening to Pounds 1.34m against Pounds 1.04m. Losses per share were 9.6p (18.3p), reflecting a consolidation and rights issue. The company has now negotiated the refinancing demanded by its banks. Private and institutional shareholders will subscribe to Pounds 978,000 loan stock, the European Coal and Steel Community will provide a Pounds 250,000 loan, the Welsh Development Agency has agreed to a Pounds 485,000 factory sale and lease-back arrangement, and Rhondda and Mid-Glamorgan local authorities have agreed to provide bank guarantees worth Pounds 350,000. The group also has a cost-cutting programme including redundancies, and is considering mergers or disposals. No improvement in sales is expected until 1993.</p>

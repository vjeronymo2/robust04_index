			<p>930809 FT  09 AUG 93 / People: Resort Hotels checks in a different chairman Resort Hotels, which saw its shares suspended mid July and appointed independent accountants to investigate ' a number of financing and reporting issues', has changed its plans regarding the chairmanship succession. Current chairman Richard Strong has resigned, a few months earlier than planned, while Kleinwort Benson deputy chairman Tim Barker, who was named chairman designate of Resort in February, will not now take up that position, remaining as deputy chairman. Instead, David Tonkinson, who had been deputy chairman until Barker was appointed, now becomes chairman. In February he 'happily stood aside for someone with as much prestige as Tim Barker' as Robert Feld, who resigned as managing director when the shares were suspended, said at the time. Barker explains that Tonkinson has 'got the time available'. He lives fairly near Resort's Brighton office and is 'largely retired', Barker says. Tonkinson is a former managing partner of the Brighton office of Grant Thornton.</p>

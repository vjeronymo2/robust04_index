			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Jaroslav Basta, chairman of the Czech Social </F> Democratic Party Security Commission, by Jaroslav Fiala; place  and date not given: "Law Against Organized Crime Is Necessary"]    [Text] We spoke with Jaroslav Basta, chairman of the Czech  Social Democratic Party Security Commission, about the  development of organized crime in our Republic in connection  with the situation in Russia.    [Fiala] One often speaks about growth of organized crime in  Russia. How strongly is this growth influenced by the political  situation there, in your opinion?    [Basta] The situation in Russia is different and more  serious than it is being presented in our Republic. The  traditional democratic division of power in the form of the  government-president-parliament triangle does not work there.  The government's powers are very small because many of them  have been transferred to the parliament and president. The  president has so many powers, however, that he is unable to  exercise them, and, as a result, these powers are exercised by  people who are not even constitutional officials. A great many  of them come from the "apparatus" and have behind them the  "standard career"--that is, about 20 years in the KGB and its  successor organizations.    [Fiala] Many of these people have left the security forces,  however, to become entrepreneurs, for instance. What role do  they plan in organized crime in Russia? Is the situation in our  Republic similar in any way?    [Basta] Each such operative lived in a certain ghetto and,  the more his activity had to do with the security of the state,  the more secluded he was in this ghetto. His only contacts were  his fellow workers and his clients. When you look at the way  these people run their businesses, you find out that they employ  colleagues from their branch or their former agents in their  firms. When they worked in the past on something pertaining to  the protection of the economy, this becomes extremely dangerous.  Essentially, they have contacts at the Ministry of Interior, in  the KGB successor organizations, and in the underworld. For  example, 10 functionaries of the Ministry of Interior who had  been involved in organized crime were arrested in Russia in  April. Moreover, the Russian secret services have started to  officially promote the possibility of acquiring money outside  the budget. The budget is one of the most important means of  subjecting these services to control. If they are able to  generate resources outside the budget, they become  uncontrollable. Machinations with various technologies--for  example, with radioactive materials--show how they obtain these  resources. All research institutes, factories, and installations  dealing with those materials are under the KGB's permanent  control. Whenever anything gets lost anywhere, it does not  happen without the knowledge of its former staffers. They are  mostly involved in this [cases of disappearance of radioactive  substances]. and I believe they are making use for this purpose  of agents with whom they used to cooperate.    [Fiala] Are the conditions for organized crime any different  in our country and other postcommunist countries than they are  in advanced states?    [Basta] What makes us different from the West is that, for  several decades, we did not live in a state based on the rule of  law. Ethics did not exist here, and, instead of the rule of  ethics and the law, we had the rule of anxiety. This anxiety is  now gone and people behave the way they logically must behave  because the state based on the rule of law is not ingrained in  them and some believe that everything is permitted. This is the  ideal environment for the emergence of organized crime. I am  not afraid of organized crime that comes to our country from the  West because, compared with what is in store for us, this  organized crime is civilized and less dangerous. When someone  who used to work for some security service embarks upon the path  of organized crime, he has a great many advantages, compared  with ordinary criminals. He knows how the police work and what  course the investigation will take, and he is more qualified  than an ordinary criminal. When people who were always  criminals begin to engage in organized crime here, it is far  more dangerous than in the West. The local brand [of organized  crime] will have communist roots because it will be organized by  people who were working in criminal organizations such as the  StB [State Security Corps]. The combination of the underworld  and people who worked at the Federal Ministry of Interior, for  example, is immensely dangerous. Those who used to organize  crime legally, under the cover of the communist regime, will now  organize it illegally. For this reason, I assess negatively the  Interior Ministry's claim that there is no need for laws against  organized crime in our country.    [Fiala] Wherein lies a solution to the situation, in your  opinion?    [Basta] We have only one chance--to join the coordinated  struggle against organized crime, alongside other states. For  this to happen, we must, first and foremost, make our laws  compatible with the legislative norms adopted by the European  Union [EU]. This concerns, for example, the convention on the  laundering of dirty money, which the European Union adopted in  1988. Our Republic has not adopted this convention, and it  seems that it will not adopt it, either. The longer we are a  laundry for dirty money, the worse our situation in the security  sphere and the worse our international position will become. We  should build without delay a state based on the rule of law,  complete with all the legislation this entails, including a law  against organized crime.</p>

			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei average dips below 17,000 on profit-taking SHARE PRICES lost ground on profit-taking and arbitrage selling and the Nikkei average closed below the 17,000 level, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue average lost 201.67 to end at the day's low of 16,916.32, having risen to a high of 17,172.37 in the morning session, before falling in the afternoon on heavy selling by investment trusts and tokkin, or specified money trusts. Volume was virtually unchanged at 220m shares, against 214m. Declines led rises by 585 to 330, with 200 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks shed 8.43 to 1,292.33, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 1.29 to 1,039.97. Investment trusts and corporate tokkin funds which were liquidated ahead of the March book closing depressed shares, but buying at lower levels by public funds gave support. Many investors remained absent ahead of an economic statement from Mr Bill Clinton, the US president, while others were concerned about the implications of a court trial linking Mr Noboru Takeshita, the former prime minister, to dealings involving art transactions. Electronic issues were lower on profit-taking by foreigners and corporations. European investors were seen taking advantage of the higher yen against European currencies, while tokkin liquidations also depressed high-technology blue chips. Hitachi relinquished Y10 to Y685 and NEC receded Y13 to Y637. Isuzu Motors, the most active issue of the day, lost Y3 to Y375 on trading by dealers. Other car makers were also weak, with Toyota Motor down Y30 to Y1,350 and Nissan Motor falling Y13 to Y632. Housing-related shares, which were higher on hopes of a recovery in the condominium market, lost ground on profit-taking. Daikyo, the leading condominium builder, slipped Y4 to Y855 and Mitsui Fudosan retreated Y7 to Y978. Vending machine manufacturers firmed on increased demand for smaller vending machines: Fuji Deniki Reiki put on Y10 at Y1,820 and Sanden gained Y12 at Y562. In Osaka, the OSE average eased 4.17 to 18,405.85 in volume of 110m shares. Joshin Denki, an electric appliance retailer, dropped Y110 to Y900 after investigators raided the company's headquarters on allegations that company officials had enlisted gangsters to oust the former president. Roundup THERE WERE some impressive performances in the region yesterday. HONG KONG saw a 75-point gain eroded as investors took profits after the market's recent strong performance on reports of an easing of political tensions between China and Britain. The Hang Seng index closed a net 16.18 up on the day at 6,065.62 in good turnover of HKDollars 4.3bn. HSBC Holdings again led the actives, but finished flat at HKDollars 63, while Cheung Kong advanced 40 cents to HKDollars 21.40 and Jardine Matheson firmed 75 cents to HKDollars 46.75. AUSTRALIA began to take the view that the conservative opposition coalition might win next month's federal election and the All Ordinaries index rose 15.6 to 1,612.1 in turnover of some ADollars 309m. Banks led the way, ANZ gaining 6 cents at ADollars 3.30 and Commonwealth Bank 10 cents at ADollars 6.54. News Corp and TNT rose after denying reports that they were seeking an ADollars 500m loan to fund the international expansion of their jointly owned airline, Ansett Transport Industries. News Corp added 36 cents at ADollars 30.44 and TNT 2 cents at 78 cents. NEW ZEALAND registered its biggest one-day advance in 19 months, as Telecom climbed 29 cents to NZDollars 2.83 after announcing that it is to reduce its workforce by some 40 per cent over the next four years. The NZSE-40 index put on 48.95 at 1,621.65, its highest close since August 1990. SINGAPORE improved on institutional buying of blue chips, the Straits Times Industrial index rising 10.79 to 1,629.36 in turnover of SDollars 217m. Some shipyard stocks were stronger on reports of new repair contracts, with Far East Levingston Shipbuilding gaining 26 cents at SDollars 3.94. SEOUL saw a morning rise fail to follow through and the composite index finished a net 5.30 off at 672.22 in turnover of Won361bn. Many analysts expect the market to remain flat until the new government is sworn in on February 25. TAIWAN declined on profit-taking, with Taiwan Cement easing TDollars 1.50 to TDollars 57, although the financial sector remained firm. The weighted index lost 2.03 to 3,874.73. MANILA advanced on optimism about oil drilling tests taking place off the south-western island of Palawan. The composite index rose 6.99 to 1,413.08 in combined turnover of 470.5m pesos. BANGKOK saw weakness in the financial sector as the SET index fell 11.68 to 986.65 in turnover of Bt8.4bn. Financial First City Investments, suspended from trading since Monday, said it was deferring the repayment of matured deposits. Bangkok Bank, which has said it might help to rescue First City, declined Bt3 to Bt137. KUALA LUMPUR was lifted by bargain hunting in the afternoon session but the composite index managed a gain of just 0.10 at 635.01. BOMBAY fell for the fourth trading session, ahead of India's national budget in 10 days' time. The BSE index shed 32.69 to 2,607.51. Selling pressure in KARACHI was fuelled by a proposal to ban insider trading. The KSE 100 index slipped 14.36 to 1,185.20.</p>

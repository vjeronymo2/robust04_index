			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Srpska republic president Radovan Karadzic has held  a news conference. He said that the Serbian side had a  legitimate right to defend itself by all means. If we are  attacked from the air, we would not suffer the strikes with our  arms crossed, said Radovan Karadzic, who demanded a thorough  investigation of the Sarajevo tragedy:    [Begin Karadzic recording] The reaction of the [UN]  secretary general and the entire international community to the  tragic massacre in the Sarajevo market is precisely the way the  Muslims expected it to be. Such a reaction particularly  encourages the Muslims to repeat this massacre, which is not the  first in a series of massacres that have occurred with the aim  of compromising the Serbs.    We fully understand the emotional side of all this. We are  disgusted by this crime and condemn it most adamantly, calling  resolutely for an international commission consisting of the  experts from countries that are in no way interested in the  outcome of the entire crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina, for example,  the Russians, the Japanese, the Indians, and the Chinese, with  one Muslim and one Serbian representative. We not only demand a  ballistic analysis, we also demand a forensic analysis, that is  to say, that an international and objective commission of  forensic experts determines the reasons and the time of death of  all these victims. Namely, we have had some indications that all  in all this has been staged to disrupt the international  community. Not merely this incident, but any further incidents  must, in our opinion, be investigated thoroughly by an objective  commission, which will naturally also comprise one Serb and one  Muslim. Only in such a way will the international community not  stumble in the dark in search of the culprit.    Regarding the attack, even if the Muslim side is responsible  for it, that is, if the UN firmly establishes that the Muslim  side is responsible, it is perfectly clear to us that the Muslim  side has done it, I do not know what good air strikes would do.  I think that it is much better to have a commission and  international pressure exerted on those who avoid a political  solution and, on the eve of each conference, commit great crimes  in order to sabotage the peace conference.    We shall not make the political negotiations more difficult  in any way. We are interested in accomplishing peace as soon as  possible. We have had some indications so far that a bomb could  have been thrown from a nearby building, that this bomb alone  was not of 120-mm caliber, but was wrapped in a great quantity  of plastic explosive and, as such, thrown from the 21 Decembar  building nearby. Naturally, we must work further on the proof,  and it would be the best if the expert group consisting of  ballistics and forensic experts concentrates on an examination  of the reasons and circumstances of this massacre, which we  highly praise, be correctly informed. [sentence as heard]    We shall do our best to inform them correctly of everything  that is happening. The Serbian side has a legitimate right to  defend itself by all means. If we are attacked from the air, we  will defend ourselves by all means and would not tolerate  strikes without defense. [end recording]</p>

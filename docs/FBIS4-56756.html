			<p>BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on economic activities monitored through 5 May.    According to information published by the DIARIO OFICIAL,  Central Bank profits reached $20.1 billion in 1993. According  to Getulio Vargas Foundation economist Rubens Cysne, real  profits amount to $4 billion, as the so-called inflationary tax  of $16 billion, which the productive sector transfers to the  banks because of inflation, must be deducted from the original  figure. (Rio de Janeiro JORNAL DO BRASIL in Portuguese 2 May 94  p 11)    After registering record sales in March, when 118,000 units  were sold, the Brazilian automobile industry registered a 25  percent drop in April, when 94,000 vehicles were sold. This  number includes imported cars. In April, Volkswagen sold 33,000  units, Fiat 25,000, General Motors 21,000, and Ford 13,000.

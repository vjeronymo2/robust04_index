			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Druck declines 27% but orders increase Druck Holdings, the Leicester-based manufacturer of electronic pressure measuring devices, yesterday reported lower first-half sales and profits but said orders were up, writes Paul Taylor. Pre-tax profits in the six months to September 30 fell by 27 per cent from Pounds 2.41m to Pounds 1.75m on turnover which slipped by 6 per cent to Pounds 12.7m (Pounds 13.5m). Earnings per share fell to 18p (23.3p), however the interim dividend is being maintained at 3.4p. Mr John Salmon, chairman, said: 'Due to a number of factors the first half results are down on the same period last year, but I am confident that this deficit will be partially, if not wholly, reversed by the end of the full year.' He said orders were 6 per cent ahead for the first six months and had moved further ahead since September. Orders from Germany, which had lagged other markets, had increased considerably, as had export orders.</p>

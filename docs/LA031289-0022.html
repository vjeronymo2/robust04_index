			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MODERN MATURITY;  </P> <P> THE DINING IS CIVILIZED -- AND SO ARE THE PRICES -- AT VICTOR HUGO'S  </P> <P> Victor Hugo's, 235 N. Beverly Drive, Beverly Hills. (213) 858-7292. Open for  lunch Monday-Friday, for dinner Monday-Saturday. Full bar. Valet parking. All  major credit cards accepted. Dinner for two, food only, $50-$80.  </P> <P> When was the last time you went to a really grown-up restaurant? It's probably  been so long that you hardly remember what it was like.  </P> <P> Los Angeles restaurants have been going through a phase of adolescent  rebellion, and most of us have become so accustomed to their tantrums that  we've come to accept them as the norm.  </P> <P> But there really was a time when you could make a reservation at a restaurant  and know that a table would be waiting when you walked in the door. You could  sit down at that table with the reasonable expectation that your seat would be  comfortable enough to harbor you for a few hours without demanding the services  of a chiropractor the next day. You could even talk all evening, hear what was  being said, and not wake up hoarse the next morning. Best of all, when the  waiter came to take your order, that is all he would do. There would be no  jokes, no small talk, no introductions.  </P> <P> We still have a few restaurants like that, of course. Unfortunately, most of  them are very old (and stodgy), very expensive (and formal), or both. And that  is why the opening of Victor Hugo's, a very grown-up restaurant that is very  new and not outrageously expensive, is such a pleasant surprise.  </P> <P> What further distinguishes Victor Hugo's from the other grown-up restaurants in  town is the sleek modern look of the room. This is a stunning place -- pale,  cool and up to date with artistic accents everywhere you look. The major work  of art is the exhibition kitchen, dramatically framed so that it is the focus  of the room. But unlike most open kitchens, this one is glassed in so that you  can watch the chefs perform without listening to the whir of fans, the buzz of  mixers and the clank of pots.  </P> <P> But despite its trendy touches, this room manages to be both elegant and  extremely comfortable. The upholstered chairs are gorgeous and very cozy, the  booths along the walls make intimacy easy, and no matter where you are sitting,  noise is never a problem. It's a very civilized room.  </P> <P> And the service lives up to the ambiance. It's so professional that you hardly  even notice it.  </P> <P> All this is what took us out to eat in the days before we all started going to  restaurants just to see what new sort of morsel would appear on our plates. For  although the adolescent restaurants may not be reliable, comfortable or cozy,  many of them make up for it with fabulously enticing food. And while some of  the food at Victor Hugo's is very good, much of the time you find yourself  wishing that the kitchen had a little of that adolescent energy.  </P> <P> With the exception of the specials, most of the food is not very high on the  excitement quotient.  </P> <P> Clearly the kitchen is capable of more. The specials have been spectacular: One  day there was a heap of mussels topped with a julienne of vegetables in a rich,  buttery saffron sauce of incredible intensity. Lying across the top was a  whimsical banner of pasta -- a thin sheet in ribbons of color. The dish was  fabulous.  </P> <P> Another night the special appetizer was taramasalata, the Greek speciality made  of fish roe whipped into a creamy paste. Chef Yves Buso (who once worked at the  Regency Club) elevated this simple dish into a tour de force: The taramasalata  itself was wrapped up in smoked salmon, appearing on the plate as a bright  orange disk. Surrounding it was a creamy cucumber sauce shot through with  ribbons of green chile puree. The green pattern added both visual appeal and a  small jolt of flavor. The dollop of caviar on top of the salmon did much the  same.  </P> <P> But few of the dishes on the menu are this inviting. Appetizers include a range  of choices from the seafood bar prominently displayed in the kitchen; the  shrimp, clams, oysters, etc. are all fresh and fine, but you hardly need a  great chef to prepare them. The salmon tartar, on the other hand, was a bit  bland. It needed more ginger -- or maybe some lemon, anything, to give it  pizazz.  </P> <P> There are some nice salads, but with one exception, none are remarkable. The  spinach salad, however, is a new take on an old theme: the spinach is finely  shredded, mixed with bacon and then topped with a perfectly poached egg and a  dab of vinaigrette that has some corn whipped into the blend. The dish is also  on the luncheon menu, and it makes a perfect light lunch.  </P> <P> The pasta dishes (carefully listed as "appetizer pastas" lest you be tempted to  order them as main courses) did not impress me. Rigatoni with tomato, basil,  jalapeno and pepperoni somehow managed to be bland. And the creamy risotto with  fresh porcini mushrooms was odd -- the rice, cooked until it had started to  fall apart, was served in a circle around a stew of rather rubbery mushrooms  cooked in red wine.  </P> <P> Entrees aren't always successful either. Steamed striped bass served on a bed  of oyster mushrooms was mostly bland -- and the rather tough little  broccoli-filled ravioli that came with it weren't much help. I thought the  venison was not very happily paired with a sweet raspberry vinegar sauce  (although I did like the accompanying celery root puree, cunningly wrapped up  in a leaf). And the "scaloppini" of chicken -- a breast that had been pounded  flat and filled with a layer of olive paste -- was served in a creamy sauce  that totally masked the flavor of the chicken. A very bitter garlic mousse  didn't help. As for the beef tenderloin, the large serving of very tender meat  was absolutely overwhelmed by a bordelaise sauce tasting strongly of bacon. And  the potato ravioli that came with it were no more successful than the broccoli  ravioli served with the striped bass.  </P> <P> For the most part, this menu plays it safe. There really is something for  everybody. People who like plain food will find that they can have a shrimp  cocktail, a salad and top it off with a simply grilled piece of protein. The  grilled dishes have been generally successful: One night I had a beautiful  piece of tuna, another a large and very respectable veal chop.  </P> <P> Those who are looking for more exotic eating can find that too. I found the  best of the dishes to be tournedos of salmon -- little rounds of fish served on  a bed of cabbage with a robust onion and black pepper sauce. Another satisfying  dish was loin of lamb, served in beautiful rare slices draped across little  logs of spinach and accented by the seductive potato tuiles that the kitchen  serves with many of the dishes. These large, crisp, round disks of potatoes are  so delicious that you may find yourself asking if you can have an order on the  side.  </P> <P> Desserts are not one of Victor Hugo's strong suits. A warm apple tart came in  an apricot sauce that tasted mainly of honey. A lemon tart was overwhelmed by  an unnecessary pina colada sauce. Peanut butter pie will be horrible to those  who hate peanut butter -- and disappointing to those who don't. It was thin and  airy, served in a graham cracker crust with a very unassertive chocolate sauce.  </P> <P> The chocolate-raspberry cake, on the other hand, was delicious. I suggest that  you finish your meal with that. As you eat it the waiter will arrive again and  again to offer more coffee, more water -- anything that will make your meal  more pleasant. In the face of such service, you may find yourself thinking how  happy you are to be here. The adolescent restaurants may serve more interesting  food -- but the grown-ups really know how to take care of you.  </P> <P> Recommended dishes: Spinach salad, $7; taramasalata, $8.75; tournedos of  salmon, $17.50; loin of lamb, $16.75; veal chop, $23.50; chocolate raspberry  cake, $5.50.  </P></p>

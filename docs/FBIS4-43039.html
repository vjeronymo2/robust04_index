			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Teilo Colley, PRESS ASSOCIATION] </F>   [Text] Fighting Irish terrorism is now the main task of  MI5, the head of the security service said tonight.    In an unprecedented television appearance, MI5 director  general Stella Rimington revealed that almost half the service's  resources are now devoted to combatting the activities of the  IRA and other Irish paramilitaries.    But MI5 must also contend with foreign extremists from the  Middle East and elsewhere active in the UK, Mrs Rimington added.    "The service's overwhelming focus today -- three-quarters of  our work -- is concentrated on terrorism. But the service's  most important task -- and one which takes up nearly half our  resources -- is mounting intelligence operations to counter the  threat from Irish terrorism."    The revelation follows the decision in 1992 to give MI5 the  lead over Special Branch in countering Irish paramilitaries on  the mainland. Since then, the service is thought to have been  instrumental in securing the arrest of several IRA bombers.    Referring to the risks faced by MI5 staff and their  informants, Mrs Rimington said: "Intelligence gathering against  terrorists is difficult and dangerous. Some of my staff and  many others who work closely with us risk their lives to do it."    Mrs Rimington's comments on the role of MI5, the first to be  uttered publicly by a head of the Security Service, came as she  presented the Dimbleby Lecture tonight on BBC1.    In the lecture, entitled "Security and Democracy -- Is there  a Conflict," she links the work of MI5 with the defence of  democracy. This link has been questioned in the past amid  allegations that the service showed bias in monitoring the  activities of trade unionists and left-wing politicians.    Mrs Rimington, who became the first woman to head MI5 when  she was appointed in 1991, said MI5 staff and their contacts are  motivated by a desire to defend democracy. She also referred to  the helicopter crash on the Mull of Kintyre in which 29 people  died, including a number of MI5 staff prominent in the fight  against terrorism in Northern Ireland. "They do it from a sense  of public service and a firm belief in the rule of law and the  democratic system. It is an anxious life for their families,  who support them because they too believe in the importance of  their work. When tragedy strikes -- as it did on such a scale  with the helicopter crash on June 2 -- they suffer their losses  silently and with dignity. We have much cause to be grateful to  them all."    Explaining why counter-terrorism is now the service's main  role, Mrs Rimington said "the collapse of Soviet communism had  reduced the need for MI5 to concentrate resources on thwarting  the activities of foreign spies in the UK -- one of its main  roles for much of the Cold War. Countering espionage now takes  up less than a quarter of our resources," she said.    Turning to MI5's work against foreign extremists, she said  the service had scored several successes in combatting foreign  terrorist groups and even other intelligence services who were  trying to assassinate opponents living in the UK and elsewhere.    "As one example, we have helped to prevent the intelligence  services of a number of Middle East states from carrying out  sustained campaigns of murder against their opponents in this  country and elsewhere. Members of Islamic extremist terrorist  groups and terrorists from the Indian sub-continent have been  identified and their plans disrupted."    The threat from international terrorism had declined from  its  peak in the 1980's, when Middle Eastern nations such as Iran and  Libya were apparently sponsoring various terrorist groups,  including the IRA.    But she added: ``In the foreseeable future I expect there to  remain a significant threat to British interests, although the  sources of it will vary from time to time. For example, the  determined efforts to locate and kill the author Salman Rushdie  seem likely to go on.    ``Extremists from parts of North Africa and also Kurdish  groups pose an increasing threat of violence, including to  British tourists.    ``And the conflict in former Yugoslavia could well spill  over  into acts of terrorism in Europe and elsewhere.''</p>

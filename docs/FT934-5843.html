			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Finance and the Family: Deal that turned sour To Iain Armstrong, it sounded like a good deal: a 50 per cent return in one year, writes Scheherazade Daneshkhu. But the biology teacher now seems to have lost the Pounds 5,000 he invested in a scheme from a man he says he believed was acting as an agent of City Financial Partners, even though the agreement was on unheaded paper and referred to the contract as a private transaction. Eighteen months later, the money has not been repaid, the man - Alistair Fairweather - cannot be contacted and City Financial says the deal was a private agreement between two people which has nothing to do with the company. Armstrong's predicament serves as a cautionary tale to others offered returns that seem too good to be true. He was, naturally, interested when he received a call from Fairweather, his financial adviser of four years' standing, to tell him of an exciting investment opportunity. 'He talked at length about unsecured loans and how they command very high interest rates. He also talked about the success of his business and his plans to expand it,' said Armstrong. The agreement was that Armstrong would pay Fairweather Pounds 5,000 and that the latter would repay him Pounds 7,500 one year later. Alarm bells should have been set off in Armstrong's mind at the high rate of interest but the signed agreement also referred to the loan as an 'investment in his (Fairweather's) business expansion.' Armstrong said: 'When you go to a financial adviser, they say they are a member of Lautro and are backed by this and that. I thought he was acting in his capacity as financial adviser at the company and that the company would eventually back him up.' City Financial has terminated Fairweather's contract as a result of the debt but says that, since the contract was a private one, Fairweather was not acting on its behalf. Lautro, the self-regulatory body for the insurance industry, is investigating the case. The conduct of appointed representatives - self-employed salesmen selling the products of a single life office - in the life insurance industry has been the main focus of efforts by Lautro to curb sales of unsuitable products to investors. The issue of the degree to which a Lautro member is responsible for the actions of its agents was highlighted a year ago when Guardian Royal Exchange was fined Pounds 100,000 by Lautro for failing to monitor adequately two of its appointed representatives.</p>

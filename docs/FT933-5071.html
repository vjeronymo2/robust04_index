			<p>930906 FT  06 SEP 93 / Monks looks across the pond: New chief draws on US experience MR JOHN MONKS, who this week becomes TUC general secretary, wants to draw on lessons from the US labour movement in his efforts to reverse the trend of declining union membership. 'I admire the toughness and professionalism of the American unions,' he said yesterday. 'They have to live and work within a difficult business environment in the face of large, heavily anti-union multinational companies.' The 48-year-old Mancunian, who takes over from Mr Norman Willis at the end of the week as general secretary after 23 years in the organisation's bureaucracy, is particularly keen to emulate US labour recruitment campaigns that use computer co-ordination and seek broader alliances in the community. The TUC plans to take the initiative by launching campaigns to publicise the relevance of trade unionism to the estimated 66 per cent of workers no longer in unions. A test campaign will be held in Bristol, where a number of unions intend to launch a co-ordinated recruitment drive soon. Local union activists will be mobilised to try to persuade workers who do not belong to unions to join them. If the Bristol campaign succeeds then the TUC will shift its efforts to other cities. Immediately after this week's congress the TUC will prepare its campaign to reach each of the 6m trade unionists estimated to have their membership subscriptions paid out of their pay by their employer under the so-called check-off system. Under the new Trade Union Reform and Employment Rights Act every trade unionist has to agree to union check-off within the next 12 months. Many union officials fear this could produce a dramatic fall in membership as workers decide not to renew their subscriptions. Unions will be encouraged to move their members to the direct debit system of payment as a way of protecting their finances. 'Our check-off campaign will be a good test of what we can do,' Mr Monks said. The TUC plans to concentrate its campaigning efforts in four priority areas  -health and safety, pensions, vocational and trade union training, and equal rights. It wants to co-operate with other organisations at regional and local level. 'We want to make the TUC the kind of organisation that people admire and respect, talking good sense and saying things that chime in with their experience,' Mr Monks said.

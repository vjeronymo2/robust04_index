			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / World Trade News: Malaysia in Dollars 700m purchase of jets Malaysia yesterday signed letters of acceptance with McDonnell Douglas to buy eight F/A-18 fighter jets in a deal Malaysia says is worth about MDollars 1.8bn (Dollars 700m), writes Kieran Cooke in Kuala Lumpur. The signing, during an international air show on the Malaysian island of Langkawi, is the last stage in protracted negotiations Malaysia has held with the US manufacturer. Malaysia is involved in a multi-million-dollar programme to modernise its armed forces. Malaysia is also buying 18 Mig-29s from Russia for which payment will be made both in cash and in palm oil as part of a countertrade arrangement. Among other deals announced at the air show was the sale by British Aerospace of its vertical-launch Sea Wolf surface-to-air missile system to the Malaysian navy. The missiles will be fitted to two frigates being built for the Malaysian navy at Yarrow Shipbuilding in Britain.</p>

			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Kwik-Fit to acquire Superdrive Kwik-Fit Holdings, the Edinburgh-based tyres, exhausts and brakes fitter, has agreed to buy the Superdrive chain of 125 tyre and exhaust centres from Shell UK. The deal, worth Pounds 21.5m, will increase Kwik-Fit's number of outlets to almost 800 and boost its presence in the south of England, where it has been under-represented. The Superdrive chain, launched in 1982, made operating losses of Pounds 3.4m on sales of Pounds 41.7m last year. Shell said it had decided to sell in order to focus on its core oil businesses. Mr Tom Farmer, chairman and chief executive of Kwik-Fit, estimated that it would take six to nine months to overhaul the Superdrive outlets, although they would benefit immediately from a less onerous cost structure. He said: 'The combination of Superdrive and Kwik-Fit gives us a tremendous opportunity to create an even stronger group, attract more customers and increase income.' Kwik-Fit has paid Pounds 9.5m in cash from its own resources for the chain and will assume Pounds 12m of debt on completion. The Superdrive fast-fit outlets are located in the Midlands, London and the south of England, supplying and fitting motor vehicle parts including exhausts, tyres, brakes, vehicle servicing and MOT testing. A particular attraction of Superdrive was that it offered sites in southern towns such as Tunbridge Wells and Windsor, where there were significant planning obstacles to entry. Mr Farmer said that consolidating the two chains would probably lead to the closure of about 25 outlets, although in some cases of overlap the new Superdrive outlet would be preferred to the existing Kwik-Fit site. He was keeping an open mind about the future of Superdrive's MOT testing operations, which Kwik-Fit does not currently offer.</p>

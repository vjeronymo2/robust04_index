			<p><P> June 25, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN COURT: A SUMMARY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA-RELATED BUSINESS LITIGATION  DEVELOPMENTS DURING THE PAST WEEK.  </P> <P> Conair Wins Court Ruling: A Los Angeles Superior Court judge refused to order  Conair Corp. to turn over molds and tools to manufacture curling irons.  </P> <P> The ruling came in a Los Angeles Superior Court suit by Styling Research Co. of  Canoga Park, which claims that Conair agreed to make and deliver the products  that Styling says it needs to fill its wholesale orders and continue in  business. Styling's lawyer, Andrew Hunter, said the company will pursue the  case in Hong Kong, where the equipment is located. Conair has declined to turn  over the tools until Styling pays "a few thousand dollars" of overdue shipping  costs, Hunter said. (Filed June 18, 1990. Case No. BC003704.)  </P></p>

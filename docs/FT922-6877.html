			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / World Trade News: New HK trade commissioner BRITAIN'S new trade commissioner in Hong Kong - equivalent to Britain's ambassador to the territory - is to be Mr Stephen Day, a career diplomat who has for the past five years been ambassador in Tunisia, writes David Dodwell. Hong Kong's anomalous colonial status, under which the governor is the queen's representative in the territory, but at the same time speaks for Hong Kong rather than Britain, makes Mr Day the UK's top spokesman for British interests - particularly those of business. Hong Kong is the UK's 15th largest export market and an important springboard for business in the region. UK visible exports to Hong Kong in 1991 were Pounds 1.38bn. The value of the market would be even greater if invisibles, and goods transiting Hong Kong for China, were included.</p>

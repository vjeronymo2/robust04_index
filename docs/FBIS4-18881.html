			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- According to Free Democratic Party of  Germany [FDP] chairman and Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, there  is "no disagreement" within the government on the deportation of  violent Kurds to their homeland. The latest differences are  "unnecessary," Kinkel said before journalists on Monday [11  April] in connection with criticism of FRG Justice Minister  Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger (FDP) voiced by Chancellor  Helmut Kohl and the Christian Social Union. Meanwhile, Interior  Minister Manfred Kanther (Christian Democratic Union) confirmed  that he wants to conclude an agreement with Turkey immediately  on the deportation of violent criminals. The talks between the  two countries have "progressed" on the level of state  secretaries, Kanther said.    Kinkel also stressed that expulsions and deportations are  legally possible. In the first place, however, Kurdish violent  criminals are to be brought to trial, sentenced, and serve their  time in Germany. But every Kurd in the FRG should be aware that  he will be in danger of being deported if he violates law and  order. However, according to Kinkel, the prerequisite is a  "clean" examination of each individual case, which is to be  dealt with with "extreme caution."    "Unfortunately, human rights are still violated in Turkey,"  the foreign minister said. The FRG deduces the right and the  commitment to call for the observation of human rights precisely  from its "friendly attitude" toward Turkey and its important  role as a NATO and economic partner. According to Kinkel, his  ministry is carefully examining information on the use of arms  supplied from Germany in Kurdistan. Therefore, the last partial  delivery of German armament goods was temporarily stopped. The  Turkish Government is to combat the terrorism initiated by the  Workers Party of Kurdistan, PKK, "but with means of the  rule-of-law state."    Interior Minister Kanther commented optimistically on the  chances of a deportation agreement with Ankara. The interest of  the two countries in the prevention of extremist actions of  Kurds is great. Therefore, he also expects Turkey to be  accommodating as far as promises concerning the possible  observation of lawsuits and "regulations of access" to the  deported persons are concerned, Kanther stated.    In his opinion, "only few" Kurds to be deported are in  danger  in their homeland. Therefore, "with the discussion being  restricted to capital punishment and torture, one loses sight of  the iceberg under water," the minister said. Many participants  in violent acts in Germany are "not threatened as Kurds in  Turkey, not even by criminal proceedings." More consistent  action than before has to be taken above all against these  perpetrators, he said.</p>

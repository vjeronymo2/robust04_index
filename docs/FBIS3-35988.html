			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Mikhail Dolidze report: "Georgia: Tbilisi Awaits Boris </F> Yeltsin"]    [Text] Tbilisi -- The final round of Russian-Georgian  talks, where the treaty on friendship, good-neighborliness, and  cooperation between the two countries and a package of other  documents are being prepared for signing, began Monday. Boris  Yeltsin and Eduard Shevardnadze are to sign them 3 February.    On the eve of Boris Yeltsin's visit to Tbilisi Shevardnadze  has advocated launching new relations with Russia designed to  help settle the Abkhazian and South Ossetian crises and overcome  economic difficulties. The Georgian leader stressed that the  documents which will be signed meet Russia's strategic  interests. On the subject of the imminent return 10 February of  the Georgian refugees to Abkhazia, Shevardnadze announced the  prospect of a Russian peacekeeping mission in the conflict zone  in collaboration with the UN endeavors.    Rumors are rife about Georgia's also joining the ruble zone.  Parliamentary discussion of issues which have generated the  inflation of the coupon has been put back to 10 February. The  Cabinet of Ministers said it was not ready to issue an analysis  of the problem. This situation was assessed thus: Yeltsin will  come, Georgia will enter the ruble zone, and there will be no  need to discuss the coupon problem, since the coupon itself will  no longer exist.    "The question of the possibility of Georgia's joining the  ruble zone may really be on the agenda at the talks," Tengiz  Sigua, retired head of the Cabinet of Ministers and one of the  leaders of the opposition, agreed. "But I doubt that we will  return to the ruble. We have not asked Russia whether it needs  such a burden. Those who claim that if Georgia joins the ruble  zone it will receive products and energy sources at the wave of  a magic wand are bluffing. We will not see those so easily.  But the fact that we need to build good-neighborly relations  both politically and economically -- that I agree with."    Irakliy Tsereteli, chairman of the National Independence  Party, wants to gain an advantage for himself from Yeltsin's  visit -- to restore the prestige of the street platform. He  came to the parliament from street rallies, and he wants to go  back to them. This young radical is promising to gather an  audience on the days of Yeltsin's visit and hold a rally outside  the Russian Embassy building.    "Russia should know that not everyone in Georgia is  satisfied  with its imperial attitude toward us," Tsereteli told  journalists.    Tsereteli will hold a rally if he can assemble an audience,  which people here doubt. But B. Kakubava, head of the Abkhazia  liberation organization and a deputy in the Georgian parliament,  does not have to go out of his way to gain an audience. There  are thousands of refugees from Abkhazia in Tbilisi today. In  the next few days Kakubava is planning to bring them out onto  the streets, and these will be the first "meeting groups" the  Russian president will see, he stated; they will sit down at the  airport and the Russian Embassy and declare a hunger strike,  demanding a meeting with Yeltsin.    "Yeltsin will hear us," Kakubava said. "We will tell him how  guilty Russia and Russian citizens are for the fact that 250,000  refugees now find themselves displaced from their homes."    Another person who comes from Abkhazia is more pragmatic --  Vice Premier Tomaz Nadareishvili, who once headed the government  of the autonomous formation. Nadareishvili believes that  rallies are not compulsory. You simply have to ask the specific  questions.    And as for the official authorities, they are waiting  impatiently for the Russian president's first visit. A  commission to meet B. Yeltsin has been set up. Georgia, which  suffered during the years of ersatz independence, thirsts first  and foremost for serious political and economic cooperation.</p>

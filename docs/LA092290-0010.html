			<p><P> September 22, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATIONALISTIC DREAMS OF UNITY IN MIDDLE EAST  </P> <P> In response to your editorial "Why Scapegoat Germany, Japan?"  </P> <P> Yes, I have to repeat this question.  </P> <P> Did President Bush ask the agreement of the European countries and Japan for  his military dispositions in the gulf region? No, he didn't. He also didn't ask  the American people.  </P> <P> And the bill should naturally be paid by others. Especially Germany and Japan.  We didn't order this military demonstration of power. Without it, there  wouldn't be so many hostages. And it would have been better to do what Henry  Kissinger said years ago: Let them kill each other.  </P> <P> FRIEDA HOFFMANN  </P> <P> Frankfurt, W.

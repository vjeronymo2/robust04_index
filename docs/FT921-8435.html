			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / Row looms over control of HK media A ROW between China and Britain over control of the media after 1997 has grown more likely with Beijing making it known through the Hong Kong press that it opposes plans to change the status of Radio Television Hongkong (RTHK), the colony's English-language broadcaster. The plans, which if enacted would change RTHK from a government department to a statutory corporation, are the subject of negotiations between Britain and China in the Joint Liaison Group. Britain tabled the plans in December, but Beijing has not yet given a formal response. However, Wen Wei Po, a Beijing mouthpiece, has accused the British government of seeking to make RTHK independent so the network could continue to serve British interests after 1997. 'In the past the (Hong Kong) government has always recognised the need to keep RTHK as the official broadcaster . . . What is the motive behind the plan to hive off the station and deprive the future government of its services?' Beijing has often used sympathetic Hong Kong newspapers to ventilate its views on Sino-British relations. The tone of the article is in keeping with the conspiratorial gloss Beijing often applies to bilateral Hong Kong issues. Plans to change RTHK's status date back to just after Britain and China signed the 1984 Joint Declaration, the basis for China's resumption of sovereignty in Hong Kong, but the Hong Kong government has dragged its feet. A government inquiry in 1985 recommended that RTHK should become independent of direct government control. In 1987, the government accepted the committee's advice and plans were laid for RTHK to be run by a board of governors. The government returned to the decision in 1989, deciding that RTHK needed to be more independent and should be changed into a public corporation.</p>

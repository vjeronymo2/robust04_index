			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Lilium occidentale <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  grows at the edges of sphagnum bogs and in forest or thicket openings along the margins of ephemeral ponds and small channels. It also grows in coastal prairie and scrub near the ocean where fog is common. Herb and grass associates include  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Calamagrostis nutkaensis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (Pacific reedgrass),  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Carex <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  sp.

Tree associates include  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Pinus contorta <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (coast pine),  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Picea sitchensis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (sitka spruce),  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Chamaecyparis lawsonia <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (Port Orford cedar), and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Salix <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  sp. (willow) (Schultz 1989).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Lilium occidentale <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  has not been widespread in recent times. Historical records indicate that it was once more common than it is today. After the ice age, rising sea levels flooded marine benches where bogs and coastal scrub would have been more extensive than today. That may account for the patchiness of its current habitat distribution. It is known or assumed to be extirpated in at least nine historical sites, due to forest succession, cranberry farm development, livestock grazing, highway construction, and other development. Its status is uncertain in at least seven other historical sites (Schultz 1989). These factors continue to threaten the lily, with development taking a primary role. Two known populations near Brookings, Oregon were partially or totally destroyed by unpermitted development-related wetland fill activity in 1991. The largest known population and three smaller populations near Crescent City, California are currently threatened by housing and recreation development (Dave Imper, pers. comm. 1991).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Previous Federal Action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Federal action on this plant began as a result of section 12 of the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), which directed the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution to prepare a report on plants considered to be endangered, threatened, or extinct in the United States. This report, designated as House Document No. 94&hyph;51, was presented to Congress on January 9, 1975. In that document,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Lilium occidentale <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  was considered to be endangered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On July 1, 1975, the Service published a notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (40 FR 27823) accepting the report as a petition to list the species within the context of section 4(c)(2) (now section 4(b)(3)(A)) of the Act), and giving notice of its intention to review the status of the plant taxa named therein. In this and subsequent notices,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Lilium occidentale <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  was treated as under petition for listing as endangered. As a result of that review, on June 16, 1976, the Service published a proposed rule in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (41 FR 24523) to determine endangered status pursuant to section 4 of the Act for approximately 1,700 vascular plant species, including  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> L. occidentale. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The list of 1,700 plant species was assembled on the basis of comments and data received by the Smithsonian Institution and the Service in response to House Document No. 94&hyph;51 and the July 1, 1975,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  publication.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 1978, amendments to the Act required that all proposals over 2 years old be withdrawn. A 1-year grace period was given to proposals already over 2-years old. On December 10, 1979, the Service published a notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (44 FR 70796) withdrawing the portion of the June 16, 1976, proposal that had not been made final, including  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Lilium occidentale, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  along with four other proposals that had expired.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service published an updated Notice of Review for plants on December 15, 1980 (50 FR 82480) including  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Lilium occidentale <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  as a category 1 species, meaning that the Service had sufficient information to support a proposal for listing. A review of the information available on this species in 1985 indicated that category 2 status was more appropriate, and the plant was included as such in the September 27, 1985 (50 FR 39526) Notice of Review for plants. Category 2 species are taxa for which the Service has some information indicating that listing may be warranted, but additional information on biological vulnerability and threats is needed to support a proposal for listing as threatened or endangered. In 1989, a status review of the species was completed (Schultz 1989). This report provided the additional information necessary to elevate the species to a category 1 candidate; it was included as such in the February 21, 1990, Plant Notice of Review (55 FR 6184).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Act requires the Secretary to make findings on pending petitions within 12 months of their receipt. Section 2(b)(1) of the 1982 amendments further requires all petitions pending on October 13, 1982, be treated as having been newly submitted on that date. On October 13, 1983, the Service found that the petitioned listing of this species was warranted, but precluded by other pending listing actions, in accordance with section 4(b)(3)(B)(iii) of the Act; notice of this finding was published on January 20, 1984 (49 FR 2485). Such a finding requires the petition to be recycled yearly pursuant to section 4(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Act. The finding was reviewed each year from 1984 through 1991. A proposal to list  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Lilium occidentale <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  as endangered was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on October 26, 1992 (57 FR 48495). The Service now determines  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> L. occidentale <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  to be endangered with the publication of this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

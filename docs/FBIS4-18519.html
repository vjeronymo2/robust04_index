			<p>BFN     [Text] Under the leadership of President Martti Ahtisaari,  the government's Foreign Affairs Committee has discussed NATO's  Partnership for Peace [PFP] initiative. Participation in the  PFP program would, in line with earlier plans, concentrate on  peacekeeping activities. Finland could offer peacekeeping  training to those countries that want to take part in the UN's  or the CSCE's peacekeeping operations. Finland is also prepared  to take part in cooperation in the planning of peacekeeping  operations.    The government stresses once again that Finland does not  seek  new defense solutions from the PFP and reiterates its doctrine  of Finland's military nonalliance and an independent defense.  In the government's view, NATO's PFP serves the stability of  our continent and does not create new boundary lines.</p>

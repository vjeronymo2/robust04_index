			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / Lean times for a man with a taste for the grand style: The insouciant Christian Lacroix, one of the last of a dying breed of couturiers, speaks to Alice Rawsthorn CHRISTIAN Lacroix is clever, courteous, cultivated and charming, but also one of the last of a dying breed. Lacroix is a fashion designer, not just any old designer, but a Paris couturier in the grand style with an opulent hotel particulier on the rue Faubourg Saint Honore where an atelier of skilled seamstresses pore painstakingly over the designs he unveiled at his haute couture show last Sunday. Five years ago when Lacroix set up his couture house, the first to open in Paris for over a decade, he was hailed as the bright young designer who was going to breathe new life into high fashion. Today he is still in business and last Sunday's show was a critical triumph. But it is almost inconceivable that another new designer would be launched today in the same grand style as Christian Lacroix. 'Times change,' he says serenely from the leafy garden of his hotel a few doors away from the Elysee Palace. 'Five years ago we were living in an era of luxury, Dallas, Dynasty and easy money. Fashion designers were style dictators telling people what to wear. Today things are different. People are less materialistic, more introspective. Designers must find a new role.' Lacroix, 41, fell into fashion by accident. He was born in Arles in southern France. His father was an engineer from protestant stock in the mountainous Cevennes region, 'very strict, very sober, very moral', his mother's family was Provencal, 'warm, exuberant, theatrical'. He studied art history at university with the vague idea of becoming a curator in the costume department of a museum. Design did not appeal at the time. 'This was the early 1970s. My own style was a combination of Katmandu hippy and Bloomsbury Bohemian. Designers did not seem relevant and I was never interested in becoming an old-style couturier, a technician like Balenciaga or Christian Dior.' But by the mid-1970s a new group of young designers, led by Claude Montana and Thierry Mugler, was emerging in Paris. A friend took him to see a Mugler show. 'It was wonderful - like a 1940s movie. Mugler treated his collection as a form of theatre to express his ideas. I had found what I wanted.' Like most young designers he started off as a freelance. He had one contract in Italy to make shoes for high class hookers and another in Japan designing dresses for the princesses at the Imperial Palace. 'I was a mercenary. I loved it.' He made his name in the early 1980s through his funky couture collections for Jean Patou, one of the more obscure Paris houses. In 1987 he was introduced to Bernard Arnault, now chairman of LVMH, the global luxury goods group, then a very ambitious young French businessman. Arnault saw Lacroix as someone who could attain the same stature as the great French fashion designers, Christian Dior and Coco Chanel. The pay-back, or so he calculated, would come from the string of licensed products, the scents, cosmetics and sunglasses, bearing the Lacroix name and the cachet of his fashion collections. At the time it all seemed to make sense. The luxury goods business was booming. Lacroix looked like a role model for the modern fashion house with Arnault taking care of the finances. He paid for everything from the seamstresses' wages to the Garouste and Bonetti bill for the pink and orange interior of the hotel. All Lacroix had to do was to deliver his collections  -and lots of glossy photographs of his haut Bohemian lifestyle in the fashion magazines - so that Arnault could market his elan. Christian Lacroix kicked off with couture and then launched pret a porter. He has since opened shops: the next opens on Monday on London's Sloane Street. He has signed licences for everything from men's ties to women's tights. Two years ago he, or rather Dior Parfums, another part of the Arnault empire, launched C'est La Vie], the perfume with which his backer hoped to recoup his Pounds 18m investment in the couture house. In retrospect Arnault's timing could scarcely have been worse. Lacroix staged his first couture collection in Paris to rave reviews in July 1987. Three months later he took it to New York arriving on the eve of the stock market collapse. 'We held the show in the Wall Street district. It was terrible. There had been three suicides already that day. No-one was in the mood for Parisian frivolity.' Bernard Arnault has yet to see a single cent back from his investment. The couture collection is still losing money and pret a porter has been fraught with production problems. Most worrying of all, C'est La Vie], which has cost LVMH Pounds 17.5m, is not a success. 'It's the recession,' says Lacroix. 'People talk about our losses, but Bernard Arnault sees us as an investment, a long term investment. We always knew we would lose money for the first five years. If it wasn't for the recession we would be making money next year. Now, who knows?' Beneath the veneer of insouciance he must be worried that Arnault could decide to cut his losses and close the house of Lacroix. From time to time the Paris fashion world ripples with rumours that Arnault is about to do just that and to dispatch Lacroix to Christian Dior, another of his fashion houses. So far the rumours have proved unfounded. Arnault can have few complaints on the creative front. Lacroix has his critics in the fashion press, but they are easily outnumbered by his fans led by the redoubtable Suzy Menkes, fashion editor of the International Herald Tribune, who faithfully flaunts his gaudy suits from the front row of every show. Moreover, as Arnault must be well aware, Lacroix is seen as an institution in France, where fashion designers are feted as national treasures. Any attempt at closing the house could be catastrophic for Arnault's public image. He made a rare appearance at last Sunday's couture show as if to signal his support for his designer. 'So far Bernard Arnault has had the courage and vision to support us,' says Lacroix. 'Let's hope he continues.' In the meantime, Lacroix is left to fulfil his side of the bargain, by concentrating on design. This is a turbulent time for the fashion world. The 1980s was an era when everything, not only the economic environment, but also the cultural climate of conspicuous consumption, seemed favourable to fashion designers. The climate has changed. Conspicuous consumption has faded, as much because of environmental concerns as recession. The elitism of designer clothes is as alien to today's 20 year-olds, the 'rave' generation, as it was to their hippy predecessors, like Lacroix himself, in the early 1970s. 'There has been a return to the values of the early 1970s,' says Lacroix. 'People are no longer interested in clothes as status symbols, to show how much money they have. Instead they see them as a form of self-expression. As designers we have to use our instincts to interpret the new mood.' So far the designers' response seems to have been to panic and to fling themselves to ever-greater extremes of opulence. Fashion today is polarised between basics, the functional jeans and T-shirts sold by The Gap, and the fin de siecle excesses of designers such as Gianni Versace, Karl Lagerfeld and, some say, Lacroix. 'People say it's immoral to make such expensive clothes at a terrible time of recession, ecological catastrophes and war in Yugoslavia. But that's not a valid issue. The reason my clothes cost so much is because they use beautiful materials, velvets and silks, and are made by hand with great skill. Those are timeless values, part of the French artisan tradition.' It is this craftsmanship, he believes, that will enable the designers to define a new direction. 'This is an era when people are concerned with internal values and the quality of life. Couture is all about quality. I would never claim that fashion is a form of art. It isn't. But I do believe that you can get as much aesthetic pleasure from a beautiful piece of couture embroidery as a fine painting or a piece of sculpture. Fashion's role in the 1990s is to explore those rituals.' He may be right. But even if he is, fashion designers seem destined to play a more marginal role in the 1990s, than in the 1980s, with less influence over fashion trends and less appeal to investors. If Lacroix was starting off today he would find it very difficult to persuade anyone to set him up in his own house, run in the grand style. For all his talent, he would be more likely to be struggling as an independent, or to be designing under someone else's name as he did at Patou. Christian Lacroix was lucky in meeting the right man, Bernard Arnault, at the right time, just before the recession. 'I need the grand style. Some designers can work from tiny rooms running up dresses in cheap fabric and showing them in disused metro stations. Not me. It's the rituals and the tradition of a big house that inspires me. And fashion is the only thing I can do. I don't have the talent for anything else.'</p>

			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Foreign investors 'ignore' EU issue Ninety-one per cent of foreign-owned companies would not change their attitude to the UK if the government reduced its commitment to the European Union, a survey has found. The size of the UK market is the main attraction for foreign investors, according to a survey of 800 executives of foreign-owned companies, conducted for the accountants and management consultants KPMG Peat Marwick. Only 3 per cent of foreign companies cited cheap labour as an investment reason in contrast to 58 per cent who said the UK was a valued market. Most executives praised the UK's workforce, industrial relations, training and productivity as better than expected, while infrastructure and transport also exceeded expectations. The UK is the leading choice for European headquarters for non-European companies, with 56 per cent of US and 32 per cent of Japanese concerns choosing Britain. Foreign-owned Companies in the UK.

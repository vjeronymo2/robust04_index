			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by G. P. Kostikova, D. V. Korolkov, and Yu. P. </F> Kostikov; St. Petersburg State University; presented by  Academician Yu. A. Buslayevyy; UDC 541.67:541.451]    [Text] In our previous article [1], we proposed that a  periodic redox reaction is the basis of high temperature  conductivity in oxides. It was shown that a system in which such  a reaction proceeds exhibits all the properties of high  temperature superconductors (HTSC), and in a number of cases  (isotope effect, effect of paramagnetic impurities or ionizing  radiation), the explanation of HTSC properties derived from the  developed model appears to be more natural than those derived  from classical positions. In this work, a comparison of  experimental data on HTSC concentration characteristics with  results of a thermodynamic analysis of the possibility of the  occurrence of a periodic redox reaction in an oxide, depending  on its composition, was conducted in support of this model.  Required thermodynamic data were taken from [2], and  calculations of missing values were conducted according to well  known laws of thermodynamics [3].    The central question consists of whether, on the basis of  the  thermodynamic values that characterize a periodic redox  reaction, one can determine the composition of superconductors  at which a mamimum effect would be observed. For  YBa[.sub]2[/]Cu[.sub]3[/]O[.sub]7-[/], the  composition parameter is the oxygen index; for  BaPb[.sub]1-x[/]Bi[.sub]x[/]O[.sub]3[/], it is the  bismuth index.    The condition at which the periodic reaction occurs is,  naturally, where the change in the Gibbs free energy is equal to  zero [4]. The actual process in  YBa[.sub]2[/]Cu[.sub]3[/]O[.sub]7-[/] is modelled,  obviously, by the reaction  Cu[.sub]2[/]O + BaO[.sub]2[/] &lt;--&gt;  2CuO + BaO.    The free energy of this reaction oscillates about zero in  the  bulk structures of BaO[.sub]1.52[/] and CuO[.sub]0.74[/]  oxides. When translated to the superconductor formula, this  yields an oxygen index of 6.76, i.e., superconducting properties  should appear in the composition  YBa[.sub]2[/]Cu[.sub]3[/]O[.sub]6.76[/]. The  superconducting property dependence of this compound has been  studied in many works. According to data in [5], superconducting  properties appear in the composition interval 6.5 - 6.98 (in  oxygen index values). Later studies [6] have narrowed this  interval to 6.8 - 7.0 for T[.sub]c[/] = 90 K and 6.6 - 6.75  for T[.sub]c[/] = 60 K.    In the BaPb[.sub]1-x[/]Bi[.sub]x[/]O[.sub]3[/]  superconductor, where, according to RFE-spectroscopic data,  Pb[.sup]II[/], Pb[.sup]IV[/], and Bi[.sup]III[/],  Bi[.sup]V[/] are present, the primary process through which  electrical current transmission is made possible is the reaction  PbO + Bi[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]4[/] &lt;--&gt;  PbO[.sub]2[/]  + Bi[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/].    The free energy of formation of Bi[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]4[/]  is in the interval 130-150 kcal/mol. Taking this value into  account, the free energy of this reaction oscillates about zero  for the composition  BaPb[.sub]1-x[/]Bi[.sub]x[/]O[.sub]3[/] at x =  0.16-0.34. Actually, the maximum superconducting properties of  this compound are observed at x is approximately equal to 0.25  [7]. It should be noted that these were evaluated for a  temperature of 298 K. The transition to temperatures  characteristic for superconductors introduces only insignificant  corrections.    Free energy values were calculated for reactions that model  processes in more complex systems. The formation of a complex  oxide, in which the discussed redox reactions occur, uniformly  affects the thermodynamic properties of all components  participating in the reaction without affecting their ratio. The  role of atoms of elements contained in the structure of the  compounds but that do not participate in the redox reaction (Y  in the first case, Ba in the second) apparently leads to the  establishment of a unit cell metric and a temperature dependence  of the metric that also governs the electron tunneling potential.    The developed model allows one to predict combinations of  elements and the valent forms of their oxides where the periodic  redox reaction will probably occur. In this regard, S. A.  Shukarev's hypotheses about how the relative stability of  various valent forms of a single element depend on  ``isometalloid'' values, which are the free energy of formation  of the oxide divided by the number of oxygen atoms in the oxide  [8], are useful. Values of the Gibbs free energy for oxides with  varying degrees of metal oxidation are presented in table 1. A  convenient parameter for matching redox pairs is the  isometalloid difference _D_. Oxides that are either contained  in  superconductor structures or are used as alloying dopants and  for which reliable data on the free energy of formation are  available are presented in table 1.  &lt;graphic&gt;   <FIG ID=JPRS-UST-005L-10A>      Table 1. Thermodynamic characteristics of oxides. </FIG>     If one were to start from the premise that a superconductor  is a system with periodic redox reactions, then it is clear that  the appearance of superconducting properties may be expected for  redox pairs whose _D_ values agree in sign and are close in  magnitude. In this case, the free energy of the reaction will be  equal to zero for equimolar ratios of oxidized and reduced  forms. The maximum electron tunneling potential should be at  precisely these concentrations. Based on this, one may conclude  that for the pair Cu[.sup]I[/]-Cu[.sup]II[/] (a required  component for all superconductors with maximum T[.sub]c[/]),  favorable partners for occurrence of the periodic redox reaction  will be the VO-V[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/],  V[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]-V[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]5[/], and  CoO-Co[.sub]3[/]O[.sub]4[/] pairs. In the case of chromium  oxide, equilibrium would be strongly shifted from the equimolar  ratio; therefore, the probability of occurrence of the redox  reaction in mixed oxides of copper and chromium would be  significantly lower. In mixed oxides of iron and copper, the  type of periodic reaction discussed here is generally impossible.    Let us turn our attention to the system of mixed oxides of  iron and tin. Based on our hypotheses, one would expect the  appearance of superconducting properties in the system  FeO-Fe[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]-SnO-SnO[.sub]2[/] or in  more complex systems with the participation of components that  are inert with respect to the redox reaction, e.g., yttrium in  YBa[.sub]2[/]Cu[.sub]3[/]O[.sub]7-[/].    In such a manner, the thermodynamics of possible redox  reactions in the discussed compounds within the framework of  hypotheses about the periodic reaction allow one not only to  calculate experimentally confirmed compositions of already known  superconducting oxides, but also to predict new oxide systems  with high temperature superconductivity.

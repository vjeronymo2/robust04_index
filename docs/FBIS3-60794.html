A Hamas representative in Amman, Muhammad Nazzal, told AFP:  "The ceasefire announcement is not true, and the proof is the  killing on Friday of an Israeli colonel."    Israeli army officials said Lieutenant-Colonel Meir Mintz,  gunned down in the occupied Gaza Strip on Friday, was the most  senior officer ever killed by Hamas.    The military wing of Hamas in the occupied territories,  'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam, claimed responsibility for the attack, in  which a Palestinian passerby was also killed and three soldiers  were wounded.    In a statement which appeared in the Gaza Strip on Thursday,  Hamas announced for the first time a three-day halt to attacks  on Jewish settlers, to give Israel a chance to reciprocate.    However, it said the struggle against the Israeli Army would  continue.    Nazzal said Israelis hatched the ceasefire statement in a  bid  to "create chaos and uncertainty among Hamas fighters in the  occupied territories."    Meanwhile, another Hamas spokesman in Amman, Ibrahim  Ghawshah, said Hamas was seeking to clinch 40 percent of the  leadership of the "Palestinian Forces Alliance," grouping 10  factions opposed to the Israel-PLO autonomy deal.    "Our draft formula favors a 50-member central leadership: 40  percent for Hamas, 40 percent for the other nine factions and 20  percent for independents," Ghawshah told AFP.    He said it was the same ratio as that demanded by Hamas  three  years ago as a condition for joining the Palestine National  Council (PNC), the Palestinian parliament-in-exile.    Other opposition groups, including the Democratic Front for  the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP) and the Popular Front for the  Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), favored a 30-member central  leadership, consisting of two representatives from each of the  10 factions and 10 independents, said Ghawshah.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Sao Paulo, 13 Jun (AE) -- Presidential candidate  Luis Inacio Lula da Silva (PT) [Workers Party] today said that  if he is elected president he could allocate 10 percent of the  federal budget to his jobs program. He did not say how he would  be able to do this, as most of the budget funds are allocated to  expenditures contemplated in laws. "The budget funds have not  been allocated, particularly as the budget has not even been  approved. This is a shame. It should have been approved in  December. It is a shame to see that the government has no  power, not even to approve the budget," he said, changing the  subject. This morning Lula recorded the program for small  businessmen linked to Sebrae [Service for Support to Small and  Micro Firms], which will be broadcast by TV Executive in 28  auditoriums in the state capitals.    According to Lula, it is possible to create the 8 million  jobs envisioned in his program by channeling to this goal  resources that are currently "being thrown away." In Lula's  opinion the federal government has money, and only lacks the  political will to use it well. According to him, the public  funds required for the jobs will be withdrawn from funds such as  the FGTS [Severance Pay Fund] and those contemplated by the  Constitution, such as official banks and pension funds. Lula  does not believe that the government has no money for  investment. "Government officials have little creativity. With  a little more creativity, resourcefulness, and simplicity there  would be a possibility to do more with the same money," he said,  mentioning Ciacs [Integrated Centers for Assistance to  Children]. "If there are no funds to do things such as Ciacs, I  will build meeting places and ask the Church and the labor  unions to lend their facilities for reading and writing classes."    Lula discredited the Vox Populi Institute, which reported on  12 June the results of a poll indicating that support for him  had decreased from 41 percent to 36 percent. "There are other  institutes with more credibility. This one used to serve  Collor, and met with Fernando Henrique Cardoso (PSDB) [Brazilian  Social Democracy Party) on his campaign." Lula attacked the  PSDB candidate, and said that the economic program had caused  losses to the workers. He said that even after the new currency  is implemented the workers will continue without purchasing  power. He asserted that the PT is not negotiating any agreement  with former President Jose Sarney and Senator Pedro Simon, both  from the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party]. "There is  no possibility of reaching an agreement with Sarney. That was  made up," he said. He added that he would like to talk to Simon,  because he likes him. "But he is participating in the electoral  campaign of a candidate who is disputing with ours the  governorship of Rio Grande do Sul State," he said.</p>

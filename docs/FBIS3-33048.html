In Mato Grosso do Sul,  where the Guarani-Caiova and Guarani-Nhandeva subgroups are  concentrated, their lands have been taken over by large  landowners. Upon being evicted, the Indians congregate in a few  areas such as Dourados and Amambai, where they are left to  endure growing poverty. Sometimes they submit to the semislavery  of working in the alcohol factories that have been set up in the  area. In other cases they wander around and get drunk. And the  number of Guarani suicides remains a sad constant.    Between 1986 and now, 116 Indians of all ages, but most of  them young, have sought death by throwing themselves into  rivers, taking poison, hanging themselves from trees, or killing  themselves with knives. In 1987, the leader of Sete Cerros,  Silvano Valiente, wrote a letter to the authorities asking that  land be demarcated for his people. And he hanged himself. The  situation grew worse in 1990, when 20 Indians committed suicide  in Dourados alone. A total of 34 suicides were recorded that  year. A report by the Funai [National Indian Foundation] office  in Amambai shows that the figure was 23 the following year.  There were another 21 suicides in 1992, and 17 Caiova and  Nhandeva Indians killed themselves last year.    The explanation for so many deaths can be found in the  Guarani belief that land is a divine gift to certain communities  and that it therefore must not be exchanged or transferred to  others. According to anthropologist Celso Shitosshi Aoki of the  Caiova/Nhandeva Project, which has now been merged with the  Center for Indian Work (CTI), the Guarani religion is complex  and very strong, giving its adherents a holistic view of the  world. "They do not understand, for example, why the whites  cause them so much trouble, since they believe that it is the  Guaranis who sustain life on earth through their prayers," the  anthropologist explained.    Celso Shitosshi believes that the compulsory integration of  the Guarani communities into the village of Dourados and other  villages may be one factor explaining the suicides, but that  liquor and the Pentecostal churches existing in the area are not  preponderant factors. "I believe that the suicides have to do  with the very way in which the Guarani must look at life from  the standpoint of his religiousness," says Shitosshi, who  disagrees with Funai's psychologist, Maria Aparecida da Costa  Pereira, who stated in a report in April 1991 that the Guaranis  were experiencing an identity crisis or losing their identity  and that that was why they were committing suicide.    In that report, Maria Aparecida points out that the  situation  of the Guarani-Caiovas--who constitute the largest of the  Guarani subgroups--is disastrous. "It is a society experiencing  economic, political, and social crisis--engendering in turn a  moral crisis--with juxtapositions and contradictions." She says  that the solutions to the Guaranis' problems are to be found  primarily in the "magico-religious" field and that at present,  being faced with the imposition of "a non-Indian ethic on their  magico-religious universe, particularly by the Pentecostal  sects," they have had two alternatives: either reinvent  themselves to fit a Western Christian concept or commit suicide  as an alternative to living.  <H5>  Suicide a Way of Asking for Help </H5>   For the Guaranis, according to psychologist Maria Aparecida  da Costa, planting and religion go together. Because of that,  leasing land to non-Indians is also a factor in  self-destruction. In the village of Dourados, where more than  7,000 Indians are rubbing elbows with no room to live or plant,  the Pentecostal sects are finding what Maria Aparecida calls "an  anchorage.... given the fragile state of collective and  interpersonal relations existing there." According to her, the  Indians themselves admit that they are sick and disoriented  psychologically. She sees the suicides as "messages of extreme  supplication" by young people who have no strength left.    Aparecida recalled that at one big meeting, a young Caiova  man said: "If they are not going to do anything for us, it is  better to turn off the sun"--a metaphorical reference, the  psychologist feels, to collective suicide. She emphasized that  in view of the entire atmosphere of suicide in Dourados,  measures must be taken to guarantee the minimum conditions in  which the Guaranis can exercise their right to collective life.  Anthropologist Celso Aoki goes further, saying that the Guaranis  will not be able to reestablish the sociopolitical pattern for  maintaining their ethnic identity until their lands are returned  to them. "It is in the space defined by place that Guaranis  fulfill their way of being and living and their traditions and  customs: their `tecoha.'"    Cases--Helio Bonito was 66 years old, Marcinei Souza only  11.  Last year, they and 15 other Guarani Indians found in suicide  the solution to the pain they were feeling. Helio Bonito threw  himself into the river and drowned, while the Caiova youngster,  who also lived in the turbulent village of Dourados 4 kilometers  from the town of the same name, hanged himself from a tree. Two  other members of a single family also killed themselves. A young  girl named Neide Peixoto hanged herself early in October, also  in Dourados. On the following day, her father took poison. Still  in October, Ramon Garcia, 48, and Aparecido Barbosa, 40, hanged  themselves in Amambai. The attempts at suicide are many and  frightening.    Of the 21 suicides recorded by the Native Missionary Council  (Cimi) and Funai in 1992, 20 were Guaranis. The other was  13-year-old Janevan Rosa of the Tereno tribe, who also lived in  Dourados. She hanged herself. Besides those cases, three deaths  by poisoning among the Yanomami Indians seem to have been  intentional. In one of those cases, 10 Indians ate marine toad  eggs, which are known to be poisonous. Two died. And 24-year-old  Piaba, whose family was decimated, ate nettle spurge.    The hope of the Center for Indian Rights, the Public  Prosecutor's Office in Mato Grosso do Sul, and other  institutions and agencies concerned with the problems of the  Guaranis in Mato Grosso do Sul is that it will be possible to  persuade the STF [Federal Supreme Court] to overturn the  injunctions obtained by ranchers. If that happens, the  ratification decrees will have more force.  <H5>  Land Remains With Ranchers </H5>   The struggle by the Guaranis for their land has ended up in  court. Although most of the areas have already been demarcated  and ratified, the big ranchers occupying them--with land titles  to back them up--are not returning what has traditionally  belonged to the Caiova and Nhandeva groups. The Constitution  clearly states (Article 231, Paragraph 6) that acts having as  their object the occupation, control, and possession of Indian  lands are null and void, but the ranchers, claiming that the  land in question does not belong to the Guaranis, are trying to  invalidate even the decrees ratifying those areas and signed by  the president of the republic.    The Center for Indian Rights (NDI), in an alliance with the  Public Prosecutor's Office in Mato Grosso do Sul, is defending  the Guaranis in at least 10 cases now before the courts.  According to NDI attorney Ana Valeria Araujo, a few communities  have been able to hold out and remain in their original areas,  but other thousands of Indians have been crowded into Dourados,  Amambai, Caarapo, Sassoro, Takoapiry, and other places, where  they live in a situation of growing poverty and despair. "They  cannot live on the land that the government has taken so long to  demarcate, and now it appears that the courts do not want to  acknowledge their title to that land," said Ana Valeria.    According to her, when Funai began its process of  identifying  areas, the ranchers went to court, claiming that the land was  theirs. The Indians came to be considered invaders. Beginning in  1992, Judge Susana Gomes of Federal Court No. 2 in Mato Grosso  do Sul granted all the petitions by the ranchers to halt Funai's  actions even though the Indian Statute stipulates that a  preliminary injunction halting demarcation proceedings cannot be  granted.  <H5>  Judge Fears for Property Improvements </H5>   The Center for Indian Rights appealed those rulings to the  Regional Federal Court for the Third Region in Sao Paulo, but  there again, "the judges invented a way out by upholding only  part of the appeal," says Ana Valeria. "Funai could put the  markers in place, but it could not put the Indians on that land."    According to Ana Valeria, the Sao Paulo judge felt that if  the Indians returned to their land, they might damage the  improvements which the ranchers had made there in good faith and  which are governed by the right to indemnification. Other  actions still pending before the Federal Supreme Court challenge  the decrees ratifying Indian areas. "The tendency is to reject  them, since complex cases like these should not be debated in  the form of injunctions, which are temporary and prove nothing,"  Valeria points out.  <H5>  Communities Stand Pat </H5>   The process of demarcating Indian lands in Mato Grosso do  Sul  began with the establishment of the Indian Protection Service  (SPI) at the beginning of this century. Areas totaling 19,845  hectares had been demarcated by 1935. Despite that, ranches  continued to be established there, the ranchers obtained title  to the land, and the problem has grown worse over the past two  decades because of the continuing intention to settle the  Indians in villages.    Six communities are holding on to their land, while families  in other areas have been evicted or moved. New areas have been  demarcated over the past two years, but they are occupied by few  Indians.    The Guaranis are traditionally farmers, but they also engage  in mining to a lesser extent. They live in groups of  approximately 100 individuals in an area that they call  "tecoha." According to Cimi's report, which is based on  Montoia's dictionary, "tecoha" means "the place where one can  find a way to exist."  <H5>  People at the Mercy of the Courts </H5>   Until the situation is resolved by the withdrawal of the  ranchers, the Indians will be living in desperation. One of the  situations causing the most concern is that of the Jaguapire  community in the municipality of Tacuru. The area in question,  measuring 2,089 hectares, is now being used by two big ranchers:  Jose Fuentes Romero and Otavio Junqueira de Morais. In 1984, the  nearly 200 Indians living there were dispossessed by court  order. In 1992, Minister Celio Borja recognized the land as  belonging to the Indians, and the Guarani families who had been  settled in Amambai decided to return, occupy a piece of land  along the southern border of Romero's ranch, and resume their  traditional activities.    They began planting the cleared land, sowed crops, and  gradually reacquired their former autonomy. When their  activities took them close to Otavio Junqueira's ranch, he  obtained an order in the Iguatemi District Court prohibiting the  Indians from occupying his part of it. The Military Police were  called in. Meanwhile, rancher Romero, who was already involved  in legal action in the federal courts in Campo Grande, asked for  a restraining order to make the Indians withdraw. At the end of  last November, the case was heard, and the judge upheld the  rancher. The public prosecutor in Mato Grosso do Sul, Joao  Heliofar de Jesus Villar, and the NDI attorney asked for a  60-day delay.    "That time is about to expire--on 29 January--and we have  now  appealed to the Regional Federal Court in Sao Paulo, but the  trouble is that Judge Pedro Rotta of Section 2 of that court is  not hearing the case," the prosecutor said, pointing out that  the problem in the Guarani areas will not be solved until the  Union takes real responsibility for demarcation. "It demarcates  the land and then turns the matter over to Funai, which is  helpless because it lacks the resources for enforcing any ban;  all it can do is play a bureaucratic role, without taking  political responsibility for the decision." Heliofar feels that  if the problem is left solely in the hands of the courts, it  will be five years before there is a solution.  <H5>  Indians Number Nearly 30,000 </H5>   The Guarani Indians are subdivided into three groups: the  Caiovas or Pai-Taviteraos (which is what they call themselves in  Paraguay), the Nhandevas, who also live in Mato Grosso do Sul,  and the Mbi'as, who live in the states of Sao Paulo, Parana,  Santa Catarina, and Rio Grande do Sul. Funai data show an  estimated population of 30,000, making the Guaranis the largest  Indian nation in Brazil. In second place are the Ticunas in the  Amazon Region, who number about 23,000. In Mato Grosso do Sul  alone, where the Caiovas are the majority, there are 24,400  Guarani Indians, according to a survey conducted in April of  last year. That includes about 2,000 Indians scattered around in  the various regions.    In an analysis made two years ago by the Native Missionary  Council, experts collected historical data concerning the  Guaranis, especially the Guarani-Caiovas, who descend from the  Guarani-Itatims, to explain that group's current context of  resistance and [word missing]. It is pointed out that their  traditional territory was situated between the Paraguay,  Mbotetei, and Pira'i Aquidaban Rivers and the Xerez lands and  that at the end of the last century, they were living in the  same region where they live now--the extreme southern part of  the state from the Apa River to the Paraguayan border.    The etymological meaning of the name Caiova, according to  Cimi's anthropologists, is "inhabitant of the jungle"--that is,  the rain forest. They emphasize that this anthropological  component of the Caiovas "needs to be thoroughly understood,  since it is the establishment of ranches and the consequent  deforestation that lead to the discovery of Caiova Indian  villages." At the end of the last century, that group's  territory was the scene of many battles in the Paraguayan War.  The border divides the Caiova communities on the Brazilian side  from those living on the Paraguayan side.</p>

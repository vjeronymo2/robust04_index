			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Rank Organisation The decision by Xerox to move out of financial services raises questions about its joint venture with the Rank Organisation. Mr Paul Allaire, Xerox chairman, came from Rank Xerox, and is anxious to focus his company's business on its traditional document processing strength. He would have a natural interest in buying out his UK partner in Rank Xerox. As for Rank, this would be one way of reducing its Pounds 999m debt without affecting the strategic direction of its managed businesses. If Rank's share price has risen only modestly, it must be because the market is aware of the formidable obstacles to such a convenient arrangement. Xerox is carrying around Dollars 2.5bn of debt. Until it has disposed of its financial services businesses, it could not afford the price, probably in excess of Pounds 1bn, the Rank Xerox stake would command. So far it has announced little more than a statement of intent. The whole process may take a couple of years. Rank needs to make inroads into its debt rather sooner. But the transfer of the stake does not need to take place all at once. Perhaps the two companies should consider a piece-meal approach. Xerox could either absorb parts of Rank Xerox business with Rank receiving a special dividend in return. Or the stake could be transferred in more formal tranches. Either approach would reassure investors worried that Rank's debt will fall only slowly when trading profits start to improve. Were Xerox to express an interest, Rank would not need the non-refundable deposit it has promised to exact from the consortium that has been threatening to bid for its film and television interests.</p>

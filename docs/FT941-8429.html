			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Fowler stance on European federalists irks Tory factions Sir Norman Fowler, the Conservative party chairman, came under attack from pro- and anti-European Tories yesterday after distancing the party from its federalist allies in the European parliament, the European People's party. In a speech in his Sutton Coldfield constituency, Sir Norman said Conservative members of the European parliament 'will not be bound by, nor will they stand upon' the manifesto prepared by the European People's party for June's European Parliament elections. Sir Norman said the MEPs expected to disagree with the EPP over its support for the Social Chapter and a single currency within Europe. But instead of appeasing leading Tory Eurosceptics such as Mr Bill Cash and Sir Teddy Taylor, Sir Norman's speech provoked criticism within party ranks. Sir Teddy said: 'Sir Norman should explain why our MEPs are allied with the EPP if it has such shocking opinions. The tragedy of this whole business is that the Conservative party has grown apart from the people.' Mr Cash called on the party chairman to repudiate the EPP's call for a common immigration policy, a separate European Union defence policy and a European central bank. 'If Sir Norman wants to distance himself from some of the policies of the EPP, he should distance himself from all of their polices. Let's be clear where we stand so we do not deceive the voters,' Mr Cash said. Tory officials had hoped that Sir Norman's speech would avert a split on federalism in advance of the publication of the EPP's manifesto next week. Leading MEPs said they had been reassured by Conservative Central Office that it supported their attempts to make concessions to their federalist allies. One said: 'Sir Norman's speech is an attempt to prevent an election split that occurred in the 1989 European elections, with disastrous consequences.' But pro-European Conservative MPs made it clear they were as disappointed with Sir Norman's speech as were the Eurosceptics. One prominent pro-European Tory MP accused Sir Norman of 'mishandling the situation badly' by 'pandering to the Eurosceptics'. He said unless the party put forward a more positive view on Europe several of his colleagues would not bother to campaign in the elections. Sir Christopher Prout, leader of the Conservative MEPs, told Ludlow Conservatives the EPP parliamentary alliance was designed to build a centre-right Europe. 'It enables us to work together where we agree, and diverge amicably on points where people differ.' He is known to be angry with attempts by the Tory Eurosceptics to portray Conservative MEPs as federalist.</p>

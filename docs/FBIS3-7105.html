"It is time for Thailand to have an embassy there as the  peace process is underway. It would be a lot easier to think  about it now than in two or three years," the official said.    He said Israel had developed technologies in various fields  including medicine and agriculture, which Thailand could make  use of.    Thailand's embassy in Rome presently oversees Israel, while  Israel has had an embassy in Bangkok since 1957.    The official also said the Palestine Liberation  Organization's (PLO) official presence in Thailand would  initially be in the form of a representative's office.    "The PLO at this time cannot have an embassy as it does not  have statehood yet," the official said. A final decision on the  matter rests with the minister.    In this way Thailand will "show its political support for  the  Middle East peace process now underway," he said.    The establishment of the PLO's representative office was  decided on three years ago but was put on hold because of the  Gulf War.    In addition to an embassy in Israel's Tel Aviv, the Foreign  Ministry is also considering setting up consulates in China's  Shanghai, Cambodia's Battambang, and Laos' Savannakhet.    Thailand last year approved the establishment of a Laotian  consulate in the Northeast. While Laos is considering setting  it up in Udon Thani, Khon Kaen or Nong Khai, the Thai Foreign  Ministry has expressed its preference for Nong Khai.</p>

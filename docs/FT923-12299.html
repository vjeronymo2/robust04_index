			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / International Company News: UK bank named manager of Japanese pension fund SCHRODER Investment Management, the fund management arm of the UK merchant banking group, has become the latest overseas firm to win pension fund management business in Japan. The firm has been appointed to manage Y3bn (Dollars 24m) by Japan's third largest pension fund, the Public School Teachers Mutual Aid Association. It becomes the third overseas manager to manage assets for the teachers' fund, joining Jardine Fleming and Merrill Lynch. Although the three overseas firms manage only a small portion of the fund's Dollars 41bn assets, the appointment of Schroders underlines the gradual progress being made by overseas managers in Japan. However, despite the partial deregulation of the pension fund management business, overseas managers can only be alloted new money flowing into pension funds. Existing assets must remain in the hands of the trust banks and insurance companies which dominate the industry. Moreover, while public sector funds are slowly opening up to foreign investment managers, private sector companies have been more conservative. Earlier this year, Nagasakiya, the retailer, became the first private sector company to appoint a foreign-based fund manager, allotting Y1bn of its Y23.7bn pension fund to Invesco MIM. In June, Hitachi, the electronics group, followed suit, appointing Invesco MIM and Mercury Asset Management.</p>

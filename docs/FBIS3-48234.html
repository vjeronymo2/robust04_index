			<p>Language: <F P=105> Cambodian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Reply from Sam Rangsi, state minister and minister of </F> economy and finance of the Royal Government of Cambodia, to  Theng Bun Ma, chairman of the Thai Boon Rong Company; issued in  Phnom Penh on 17 January]    [Text] I, Sam Rangsi, would like to inform Theng Bun Ma,  chairman of the Thai Boon Rong Company    I have read the "clarification" that you had your paper  REAKSMEI KAMPUCHEA publish in the issue No. 238 dated 16 January  1994. I would like to comment only on the following points:    1. In all my statements, I have never put the blame fully on  "former state officials" and said that "everybody else was  always wrong; no one was right" as you wrote. You have made  these statements up entirely because I clearly understand that  among the previous and current administrators there are good and  bad persons. I have a large number of colleagues in whom I fully  have consideration and trust; all of them served the nation in  the previous administration of the "State of Cambodia."    2. The luck I have to "step on Cambodian soil" again did not  come from the deed of the "former government" as you said; it  was due to the clear-sighted national reconciliation initiative  of His Majesty [H.M.] the King, combined with the struggle of an  overwhelming number of nationalists inside and outside the  country, and because of the will of the entire Cambodian people  who have voted for a change of regime in the country in May  1993. Despite this, I am a genuine Cambodian, born in Cambodia  of Cambodian parents and as such I have the right to come back  and live in my ancestors' land.    3. I would like to thank you for clearly showing your  conscience and the degree of your cultural knowledge in accusing  me of being a person who does not know how to "think ahead and  in reverse" and for being a "half-wit." Furthermore, you called  me "minister of economic and financial destruction."    I would like to inform you that:    -- The positions and honors that I have received so far came  from H.M. the King and from the confidence in me of the  Cambodian people who are Cambodia's sole owners.    -- Recently, I was appointed by H.M. the King, with the  consent of all political parties, member of Cambodia's Supreme  National Council which represents Cambodia's sovereignty.    -- Furthermore, I was elected people's representative in  Siem Reap constituency.    -- Lastly, I have been appointed by H.M. the King state  minister and minister of economy and finance in the royal  government that was set up in accordance with a royal decree  dated 1 November 1993.    -- You can despise me, but you should not express this  through the use of improper words against the king and the  Cambodian people who have made their judgment, selected, and  appointed me to my current position. Therefore, according to  what you said, this means that in your opinion the king of  Cambodia and the Cambodian people lack correct judgment in  electing their representatives and leaders. It also means that  only Theng Bun Ma knows how to assess the qualities of the  country's leaders.    -- Perhaps the fact that you do not have Cambodian blood  explains why you do not know how to respect Cambodia's king,  people, and customs.    4. You wrote that I "malign the former government" with  which I am "currently in cooperation" and that I want to "cause  division in the Royal Government." Who appointed you lawyer of  the "former government"? What right do you have to appoint  yourself spokesman of the new government? Let the people judge  your character as "lawyer" and "spokesman."    5. I would like to thank your company for allowing me and  for being "always prepared" to let me "inspect its books."  Regardless of this, in my position as the one responsible for  managing the national economy, particularly in the fields of  taxes and customs duties, I have full right to inspect all  companies that I suspect or about which I have sufficient  evidence that these companies have not correctly abided by the  law.    I have the honor to inform you that your company is among  the  above category of companies that are improper or would-be  improper. Therefore, I will send a number of economic and  financial officials to check your company in the near future.    6. Concerning the economy and investment, I have lived and  studied and have been an investor myself for a fair number of  years in liberal and developed countries in which there are  proper laws and good order, which is an important factor  enabling their economies to develop.    It is my view that such conditions do not yet exist in  Cambodia. This has led to the fact that a number of  "investments" made in the past three or four years have not  really promoted Cambodia's economy and society toward genuine  progress. On the contrary, a number of illegal "investments,"  not in conformity with the nation's interest and with the  people's will, have created a troubled atmosphere, corruption,  embezzlement, and injustice toward a large number of poor and  innocent people.    In my view, as long as Cambodia does not have proper law  and order and a number of leaders still do as they please,  Cambodia cannot attract proper investors with good conduct to  contribute to the country's progress in the long run. On the  contrary, in the troubled atmosphere that has prevailed over the  past three or four years, a large number of "investors" doing  business in Cambodia tended to be bad foreigners who came to rob  or destroy property and interests to pilfer and to serve their  own interests with the support of some corrupt leaders as their  partners.    This type of investor and bad businessman has infiltrated  and  taken over many exclusive rights in the national economy.  Investors and proper and legal businessmen (those who have paid  taxes and customs duties and who refused or did not know how to  bribe) cannot do business to compete with the bad guys. So, as  long as I am in the current position, I will do my best to  enable the country to have proper law and to get everyone, be  they small or big, poor or rich, to abide by law and to respect  national interest. Only in such condition can Cambodia attract  good investors to do business in the country to make the  national economy genuinely prosper and at the same time raise  social justice. I am convinced that before too long good and  law-abiding investors with respect for Cambodian interest and  customs and traditions will replace bad investors, the ones we  have so far encountered.    In economic science, there is a law, which in English is  called The Gresham Law [preceding three words in English],  saying that "The bad money drives out the good." [preceding  sentence in English] It means that "spoiled bank notes drive  out the good ones from the market." This is the same in  business in general. In other words, in a troubled atmosphere  bad investors and traders drive out good investors and proper  traders from the market.    However, with all nationalists, I will strive to do my best  to reverse this tragic and unjust current soon, namely to  attract and encourage world-renowed investors with formidable  means who are willing to abide by law and respect the nation's  interest, to replace and drive out bad investors from the  Cambodian market "The good investors will drive out the bad."  [preceding sentence in in English]    7. After the election, the Cambodian people in general, like  myself, rejoiced because we had put an and to a heavy foreign  colonial yoke. However, the Cambodian people, like myself, have  suffered and realized that our country is under the colonial  economic yoke of the "Thai Boon Rong" company with a number of  foreign criminal traders (mafia) [preceding word in English]  behind it. Everyone knows that the "Thai Boon Rong" company is  the real manager of our national economy because it has immense  resources acquired through the Cambodian people's sweat and  blood. It has used dollars to buy the conscience of some of our  national leaders, enabling it to do as it pleases. We cannot  count the number of plots of land, buildings, factories, houses,  farms, forest, coastal stretches that Theng Bun Ma has embezzled  and made his own with the collusion of a small number of old  leaders who were corrupt and who have sold off the nation.  Earlier, the question we should have asked those around us was:  "What does Thai Boon Rong own?" because of Thai Boon Rong's  already extensive ownership. Now the question we should ask is  this: "What does not belong to Thai Boon Rong?" This is because  almost the whole of our Cambodia in under Thai Boon Rong's  influence.    8. I still remember that at the end of December 1991  following a brutal repression of students who demonstrated  against corruption, I dared to openly and officially express my  support for nationalists who dared to stage demonstrations  against the old government for which Theng Bun Ma is now acting  as "lawyer."    My statement and message of support for compatriot  demonstrators at that time was carried by a number of  international newspapers worldwide. Now I have no fear  whatsoever in expressing my nationalist sentiments which have  forced me to expose and heavily stress on the colonial economy  Thai Boon Rong is practicing in my revered motherland.    Until the last drop of my blood I will show that I remain  loyal always to the nation, religion, and the king. Phnom Penh  17 January 1994 Sam Rangsi</p>

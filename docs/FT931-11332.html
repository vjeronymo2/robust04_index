			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / Letter: A more realistic view of attitudes among long-term unemployed Sir, Mr Peter Ashby's letter ('Recruitment subsidies likely to have only a marginal impact', January 26) claims an insight into the minds of (long-term) unemployed people. Being a long-term unemployed person myself (whose one luxury is your newspaper), and having done temporary work under the Community Project Scheme and some social research interviewing, which included long-term unemployed people, I feel that I can offer a rather different and, dare I say, more realistic, view of the attitudes of unemployed people. First, it is hard to believe that temporary work schemes can offer any hope to unemployed people for the obvious reason that the job would offer no security and the participant would enter the scheme with the knowledge that they will be back at square one at the end of their contract. One can say that such a scheme could re-instil the discipline of work that is destroyed by unemployment, and can give something to the person to write in their CV. But if there are no jobs out there what is the point of raising people's hopes? Mr Ashby voices the same old prejudice about the unemployed that the media and politicians have been peddling throughout the 1980s: we are a bunch of scroungers who should be forced to work for our pathetic 'income from society'. Well, no new ideas there. He then goes on to claim that this has some support among long-term unemployed people. Of course Mr Ashby and I may move in different social circles, but I think that the majority of long-term unemployed people would agree that what they need is work. And not for the notion of having pride in having a job, but simply to have a part-decent standard of living. Perhaps Mr Ashby could take this into consideration when he next descends from his castle in the sky, and come up with some real recommendations for solving the plight of so many people.

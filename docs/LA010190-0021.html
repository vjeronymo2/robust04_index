			<p><P> January 1, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> GROWTH HORMONES;  </P> <P> USE OF THESE EXPENSIVE AND EXPERIMENTAL HORMONES PRESENTS AN ETHICAL DILEMMA IN  A SOCIETY THAT OFTEN MEASURES A PERSON'S WORTH BY HIS HEIGHT.;  </P> <P> HORMONES: PRESSURE TO HELP CHILDREN GROW TALLER IS STRONG. BUT MANY EXPERTS ARE  UNCERTAIN ABOUT THE LONG-TERM RISKS AND EFFECTS.  </P> <P> Imagine a world in which short children are treated with a drug to make them  taller. Although it borders on the Brave New World -- depicted in the 1930s  novel by Aldous Huxley in which human embryos were tampered with so that they  developed standard traits -- the technology necessary to turn this science  fiction into fact is already being explored.  </P> <P> For decades, physicians have been treating some midget children with growth  hormone extracted from human cadavers to boost their height by the time they  reach adulthood. (Unlike dwarfs, who have disproportionately large heads in  relation to their limbs and torso, midgets are proportionately short).  </P> <P> But only since 1985 has genetic engineering made it possible to generate the  hormone in large enough quantities to be used for short children who are  growing so slowly that they are not expected to reach more than 5 feet, 3  inches if they are boys or 4 feet, 10 inches if girls.  </P> <P> The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development in Bethesda, Md.,  is currently conducting clinical tests to assess the effectiveness of growth  hormone in these "normal" children, who, unlike midgets, do not have a classic  growth hormone deficiency. The results will not be in for at least 10 years,  but that has not stopped some doctors from using the therapy on such children.  </P> <P> The use of growth hormone is presenting an ethical dilemma in a society that  often measures the worth of people by their height. Others argue that no  substance, regardless of one's ethical point of view, should be used widely  until it is proven safe and effective.  </P> <P> At a recent state-of-the-art conference on growth hormone therapy sponsored by  the Swedish Medical Research Council in Stockholm, about the only point 15  experts on the therapy could agree on was that tests used to detect a growth  hormone deficiency are not reliable, said Louis Underwood, a University of  North Carolina pediatric endocrinologist who attended the conference.  </P> <P> Without dependable tests, physicians cannot separate children who are growing  slowly because of a medical condition that is stemming their growth hormone  production from children who are merely following a family tradition of being  short. While it makes sense that physicians should correct the former, treating  genetically short children with the hormone raises thorny ethical issues.  </P> <P> Short stature is not necessarily a disease, points out Leona Cuttler, a  University of Chicago pediatric endocrinologist in an article in the Journal of  the American Medical Assn. last year, but part of the normal variation in human  appearance. Physicians who try to boost a normal short child's height with  growth hormone may be likened to plastic surgeons who try to improve appearance  with nose jobs and tummy tucks.  </P> <P> But consenting adults submit to these cosmetic procedures, not children.  Because growth hormone therapy is only thought to be effective in children and  not full-grown adults, a child's parents and physician must decide if he should  be treated.  </P> <P> "We have to be very careful when deciding whom to treat," says pediatric  endocrinologist Gilbert August of George Washington University. "Often it isn't  the kids who are worried about being short, but their parents.  </P> <P> "These parents, who are short themselves, vicariously relive through the child  their own failures in high school about not being able to make the team, etc.  I've often joked that if you could just do a 'parentectomy' these kids would be  fine."  </P> <P> But even without parental pressures, short stature can be emotionally costly in  our society, which values height. "The money you save by not giving growth  hormone," says August, "you may as well give to a psychiatrist."  </P> <P> Some scientists cite studies showing success is tied to height, with taller  people making more money or having more prestigious jobs on the average than  shorter individuals. The midgets who portrayed the munchkins in the movie "The  Wizard of Oz," for example, earned less money than the dog Toto.  </P> <P> Short height, however, is a relative term that is dependent on the range of  height in a population. When August told a group of dwarfs, for example, about  the possibility of using growth hormone to boost a normal but short boy's final  adult height from 5 feet, 1 inch to 5 feet, 3 inches, they were horrified.  "People 5 feet tall are like giants to dwarfs who typically aren't taller than  4 feet, 3 inches," he explained.  </P> <P> By definition, a child is short if he is in the lowest 5% of height in a normal  population. But if doctors were able to effectively treat all these children  with growth hormone, they would not eliminate short stature but rather create a  new crop of short kids -- there will always be someone in the short range of  normal.  </P> <P> "Where to draw the line and decide whom to treat with growth hormone is a  dilemma we're struggling with right now," says pediatric endocrinologist Susan  Rose of the University of New Mexico Medical Center in Albuquerque.  </P> <P> The high cost of growth hormone therapy is also an issue. "We're talking  $60,000 to $70,000 per inch," says pediatric endocrinologist Melvin Grumbach of  UC San Francisco. "Is a few inches worth the equivalent of what it costs to  send a kid to college?"  </P> <P> Another reason not to treat a normal short child with growth hormone, Grumbach  added, is that "the jury is still out" on the effectiveness and long-term  safety of the therapy used on these children. "If you know a therapy is  effective and has no risk tied to it, you do it," says endocrinologist Gordon  Cutler of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. "But if  both the risk and the effectiveness are uncertain, you should do nothing and  let nature take its course, or you should enroll the patient in a clinical  trial so we can learn what the risks and benefits are."  </P> <P> There are no clear-cut health risks associated with growth hormone therapy, but  there are some unconfirmed findings that indicate the therapy -- which usually  consists of three injections of the hormone per week for several years -- might  boost a person's chances of developing diabetes, hypothyroidism or leukemia.  </P> <P> "If we knew the therapy would give a person a four-inch gain in their final  adult height rather than just a two-inch gain, the risks are probably worth  taking," says Cutler, "but we don't know that yet."  </P> <P> Since most normal children who have been tested with growth hormone therapy  have not reached adulthood yet, their final gain in height is not known.  </P> <P> In the meantime, the parental pressure on pediatricians to treat more short  children with growth hormone is building. "Unfortunately, everybody imbues  growth hormone with magical qualities because we value growth so much," says  Rose.  </P> <P> What decisions pediatricians make on whom to treat with growth hormone will  have bearing on the use of future therapies likely to be developed to boost the  appearance rather than the health of children. "If pediatricians do not respond  to these dilemmas thoughtfully, carefully and forcefully," Cuttler wrote in her  article, "other decision makers, whose decisions may reflect political, social  or market forces, may then respond in ways that do not reflect the best  interests of children."  </P></p>

			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: India's policy right for monetary growth Sir, Martin Wolf's report on India ('India resists IMF pressure over currency', May 26) illustrates the type of dilemma which liberalising economies face in the management of exchange rate policy. India's exchange reserves accumulated to present levels mainly on account of portfolio flows, which can easily flow out again should the foreign investors reassess the relative attraction of India as a market. Adjusting exchange rates to the size of reserves could thus run the risk of introducing a degree of exchange rate volatility which could undermine investor confidence. Surely, what the government of India is doing is right: to try to sterilise foreign exchange reserves to ensure that monetary growth is stable. India's fiscal deficit had been high partly because of reduced revenues from customs duties which was in turn due to reduced tariffs combined with low level of imports and investment. The trick is to find ways of promoting investment. Under the present conditions, by throwing open infrastructure projects (communications, power, etc) to private sector investment in a much more vigorous fashion, it might be possible to induce a revival of private sector investment, including foreign. Investment in infrastructure is import-intensive and the present reserves should provide the cushion needed for it. Improving incentives for investment, rather than adjusting exchange rates, will be the key for improving growth, fiscal balance and reserve management.

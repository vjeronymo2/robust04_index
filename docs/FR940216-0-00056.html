This baseline was developed in the regulatory negotiation and was at the time the best estimate of the in-use emission performance of 1990 vehicles from which to ensure that the minimum performance standards required by section 211(k) of the Clean Air Act would be achieved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since that time the Agency has developed a new version of the MOBILE model, MOBILE5a, for use by the states in demonstrating compliance with the national ambient air quality standard for ozone. As proposed in the February 26, 1993 proposal, EPA will use MOBILE5a in conjunction with an enhanced I/M program to establish the emission baseline for Phase II of the reformulated gasoline program beginning in the year 2000. EPA, however, has decided to retain the MOBILE4.1 and basic I/M baseline assumption for the simple model during Phase I of the RFG program. Switching to a MOBILE5a baseline for Phase I would have required reformulated fuels to meet a slightly more stringent RVP standard to maintain the minimum VOC emissions performance required by the Act. The majority of the VOC emission reductions achieved by RFG are from nonexhaust emissions; under MOBILE5a, nonexhaust VOC emission reductions are less effective in reducing overall VOC emissions than are exhaust VOC reductions, while the opposite is true under MOBILE4.1. Thus, in order to provide refiners with sufficient leadtime to complete the investments needed to meet the requirements of the program, the baseline for the Simple Model is determined using MOBILE4.1.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> When replacement of the Simple Model with the Complex Model is required in 1998, the issue again arises as to whether a more stringent standard should be required by shifting to use of MOBILE5a in determining the baseline. MOBILE5a clearly provides a more recent estimate of the mobile source VOC inventory than does MOBILE4.1. However, many of the changes made in MOBILE5a were intended to significantly increase the accuracy of the exhaust emission estimates while similar changes which would have increased the accuracy of the nonexhaust VOC emission estimate were not incorporated for various reasons, including the limited time available to revise the MOBILE model. As a result, the proportional contribution of exhaust and nonexhaust VOC emissions to the in-use VOC inventory may not be any more accurate in MOBILE5a than in MOBILE4.1 even though MOBILE5a provides a more accurate assessment of the total contribution of mobile sources to the entire VOC inventory by virtue of its greater accuracy in estimating exhaust VOC emissions. Since it is the relative proportions of exhaust and nonexhaust VOC emissions and not the overall magnitude of the mobile source VOC inventory which determines how difficult it will be for refiners to meet the overall VOC standard in 1998, it is unclear whether MOBILE5a would be more appropriate to use in 1998 than MOBILE4.1.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A simple model fuel evaluated using the complex model achieves more than the minimum 15% requirement of the Act using the MOBILE4.1 baseline exhaust/nonexhaust ratio but less than the 15% requirement using the MOBILE5a baseline exhaust/nonexhaust ratio. Given the uncertainty in the actual in-use exhaust/nonexhaust ratio during this interim period, it is difficult to know whether or not the 15% actually would be achieved in-use by a fuel meeting the requirements of the Simple Model. Using MOBILE4.1 to determine the baseline in 1998 would introduce some risk that the 15% minimum performance requirement of the Act would not be met in-use by a fuel meeting the requirements of the Simple Model. However, this risk is relatively small in magnitude (less than three percentage points of emission reduction are at stake) and duration (the risk exists for only two years). On the other hand, using MOBILE5a to determine the 1998 baseline would result in some risk that refiners would be required to incur greater costs to achieve a more stringent standard than the minimum required by the Act. This greater stringency would have the effect of creating a third interim phase to the RFG program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> January 29, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DEUKMEJIAN'S SUMMIT MEETING ON HIGHWAY FINANCING  </P> <P> What Gov. George Deukmejian has done is call a summit meeting of some 26  persons to discuss a state gas tax and financing highway construction (Times,  Jan. 23). While it's useful to involve leaders in such matters, the summit  seems seriously twice flawed: appointees and the agenda itself.  </P> <P> It's all right, I suppose, for Republicans to appoint Republicans, and  Democrats, Democrats. (Especially when this promises a public good). But  there's more to this summit than simply picking friends to run it. Or people of  same politics, bad as that is. Master politicians are usually concerned with  more than their image. They frequently look at the public good. Not this time,  it appears.  </P> <P> Here's where the summit fails. The agenda is antediluvian. The inevitable  Orange County traffic reliever -- built now or later -- is of course mass  transit, elevated rails. But here comes the governor muddling away. A summit  with heads turned backwards, women and men muttering about financing highway  construction. A flapping of tongues of people programmed to look only into the  past; a wasteful, futile and certainly anachronistic exercise. Some might not  agree. Like those eyeing profits from "new highway construction" (new freeways  to serve new tract developments).  </P> <P> The summit is further doomed, it seems. Look who Deukmejian invited to the  summit from Orange County. Supervisor Thomas F. Riley. Despite his record for  new freeways and more development, nothing wrong with that appointment. He's a  county supervisor and chairman of the Orange County Transportation Commission.  </P> <P> But Deukmejian really tells us where he's coming from in the appointment of  Irvine Co. Vice Chairman and arch-developer Thomas Nielson. Nielson comes  representing the "Orange County Roundtable business organization." One whose  legitimate objective, and job description, is to ensure that future residents  of the Irvine Co.'s projected tract developments have access (roads) to their  homes. (You can't sell houses if you can't get to them, can you?) Summit  panelist Nielson a summit man? Yes. But a professional traffic planner? A  financier? A tax expert?  </P> <P> It's natural for a political party to crony up with fellows who think their  way. And these summit gentlemen are certainly honorable people. And fit the  litmus test. All Republicans.  </P> <P> No. The fault lies with a governor of a great state who seemingly fails to rise  above mean-spirited political counterproductive behavior in order to advance  his own agenda, not the public good. He arranges an activity that not only  seems to pander to cronies but ignores the potential values of a balanced  panel. Where's the environmentalist? Or even, God love us, a Democrat? He  apparently has structured the committee with those whose principal aim is  transportation, not for itself but to serve new housing development.  </P> <P> TOM ALEXANDER  </P> <P> Laguna Beach  </P></p>

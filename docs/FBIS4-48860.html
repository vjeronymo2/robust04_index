			<p>BFN     [Text] A plot to launch a Muslim holy war in Liberia has  been uncovered. A report from the Liberian capital Monrovia  said Alhaji Koromah of the Mandingo faction of the ULIMO [United  Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia] is planning to  launch a Muslim holy war in Liberia and turn the country into an  Islamic state.    The report said Koromah has mandated a delegation of the  Mandingo faction currently touring Islamic states in the West  African subregion to seek support for the venture. Koromah's  delegation has already met Nigerian authorities on the  replacement of ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States  Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] field commander, General Inienger,  with a Muslim. ULIMO's representative to the Transitional  Legislative Assembly, Mr. Morris Dukuly, is heading the  delegation which is lobbying for the waging of the Jihad War in  Liberia.    At the same time, the Liberia Council of Churches has called  on an emergency meeting of its members to discuss the Alhaji  Koromah's faction plan in Monrovia. The Liberia Council of  Churches has condemned such an intent by the Koromah Mandingo  faction and called for strong resistance to it.</p>

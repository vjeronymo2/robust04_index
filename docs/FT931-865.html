			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Securities boost Commerzbank SECURITIES trading helped total operating profits at Commerzbank, Germany's third largest bank, climb by 10.2 per cent during the first two months of the year, Mr Martin Kohlhaussen, the bank's chief executive said yesterday. Partial operating profits - which do not include any contribution from trading - were at the same level as last year. Net interest income rose 8.6 per cent in January and February, while fee income rose 14.8 per cent. The growth in profits in the early part of the year shows that Commerzbank, like other large German banks, is still maintaining some immunity to the worsening economic environment in Germany. For last year as a whole, Commerzbank posted operating profits up 20.7 per cent to DM2.2bn (Dollars 1.34bn), as disclosed in January when the bank announced a DM500m rights issue. Despite what Mr Kohlhaussen called an 'encouraging' start to 1993, he refused to be drawn on the outlook for the bank during the rest of the year. He confined himself to the remark that German banks as whole were concerned about the future in the light of German economic downturn, and that there had been a deterioration in the 'morale' of borrowers. The bank's caution was shown by its decision not to increase its 1992 dividend beyond the DM10 per share paid in 1991, and in sharply increased provisions against poor quality sovereign loans and bad and doubtful commercial debts. The bank has provided against its overseas exposure to the Olympia &amp; York property group and Hafnia, the Danish insurer, which totals DM830m. Total provisions against sovereign debt rose to more than 75 per cent of the total DM5.9bn, whilst provisions were raised to cover more than 90 per cent of ex-Soviet debt. Total provisions, together with write-downs on securities, rose from DM1.05bn in 1991 to DM2.09bn last year. As re-vealed last week, net earnings for the year rose 53 per cent to DM838m, the surge reflecting the impact of the consolidation of the bank's Berlin subsidiary into the parent bank. The bank has seen its share price increase 20 per cent this year, outperforming the market as a whole by 11 per cent.</p>

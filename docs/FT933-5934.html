			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / Link of jobs to growth queried POLICIES DESIGNED to increase the rate of economic growth in Europe will do very little to cut unemployment, a former economics director of the Henley Centre for Forecasting argues today. Mr Paul Ormerod, a visiting professor at Manchester University, says the problem of unemployment is a question 'not of economics, but of social values and social relationships'. The employed have operated in the European Community 'in an effective cartel' against the unemployed. In a paper prepared for a seminar on full employment in Europe to be held this week in Sussex, Mr Ormerod says societies with low unemployment are characterised by high levels of 'social cohesion'. He pinpoints work-sharing as one valid 'technical' solution to high unemployment, but says this would require the agreement of many people to receive less income in exchange for more leisure. In a challenge to 'orthodox' economic analysis - embraced by all main political parties - which emphasises the need to generate economic growth to bring unemployment down, Mr Ormerod argues that there is no such connection between job creation and growth. The US and the European Community have grown by 'almost identical' amounts in the past 20 years, yet employment in the US is up by 45 per cent, against only 7 per cent in Europe, he says. The seminar - to be chaired by Mr Frank Field, Labour chairman of the Commons social security committee - comes about a month after Mr David Hunt, the employment secretary, called for a national consensus between the main political parties on a strategy for tackling long-term unemployment. The event will be attended both by Mr Hunt and Mr John Monks, the TUC general secretary.</p>

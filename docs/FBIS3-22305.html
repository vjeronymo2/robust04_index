Two 40-foot container vans, each containing 22 tons  of dangerous computer scraps [preceding two words in English]  from Australia, were discovered inside the Russian ship Gamzat  Tsadasa. A Greenpeace patrol group was able to follow the ship  all the way from its port of origin in Australia.    According to Greenpeace, these computer scraps [preceding  two  words in English] can cause health problems, specifically  respiratory ailments. The computer scraps [preceding two words  in English] are mixed with asbestos and other toxic materials.    [Hong Kong AFP in English at 0728 GMT on 2 March in a  similar  report adds: "A Philippine senator and the environmental  activist group Greenpeace protested the delivery of two  containers Wednesday allegedly carrying Australian `computer  scrap' to be dumped in this country. However, the Russian ship  that brought the containers resisted calls to take back the  shipment, which Greenpeace claimed included hazardous materials  like asbestos and harmful plastics, back to Australia.]    ["Senator Orlando Mercado, a vocal advocate of environmental  measures, accompanied by journalists, located the two containers  at Manila's port and ordered them loaded back on the ship  `Gamzat Tsadasa.' Cranes were used to bring the containers  alongside the ship but crew members told Mercado that their  captain refused to take them on. Mercado was later joined by  local environmentalists and members of Greenpeace who visited  the Philippines on the last leg of a Southeast Asian tour to  protest developed nations' dumping of hazardous waste in  developing countries. They hoisted a huge banner over the two  containers, saying `Australia, stop wasting Asia.' Greenpeace  members said very little of the computer scrap could be  recycled, saying the rest would be dumped. They added that this  violated a Philippine law banning the shipping of toxic  materials to this country.]    ["Leigh Sarinas, terminal manager of Filipino-Soviet  Shipping  Company, a Philippine-Russian joint venture that owns the ship,  confirmed its docking at Manila before dawn Wednesday had been  delayed by Greenpeace attempts to intercept the ship.  Greenpeace said the shipment had been 'impounded' but Customs  officials could not confirm this."]</p>

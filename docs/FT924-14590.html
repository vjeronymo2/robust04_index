			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Brussels talks on mollifying France WITH three days remaining until crucial EC-US talks on a trade liberalisation agreement in the Uruguay Round under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, officials in Brussels are focusing on how to overcome French opposition to potential European concessions on agriculture. French government spokesman, Mr Louis Mermaz, said the new agriculture minister, Mr Jean-Pierre Soisson, had firm instructions to defend French trade interests. Mr Soisson left last night for Brussels, to meet EC Commission President Jacques Delors. 'He has gone with extremely firm instructions concerning the defence of France trade interests,' Mr Mermaz said after a cabinet meeting. Mr Soisson's talks are seen as an attempt to co-ordinate a clear EC bargaining position before the weekend talks. One tactic gaining high-level support in the Commission is to stress the huge benefits for France in the services sector if a Gatt deal was reached. Mr Frans Andriessen, EC external affairs commissioner and one of the EC's lead negotiators in the talks, said yesterday France was 'very competitive' in services. The weekend talks in Brussels will cover all disputed areas, including farm exports, services and market access. An outline deal would have to embrace a 'set of elements' which could be wrapped into a single package to be negotiated in detail by the end of the year, EC officials said. The talks, which begin on Sunday and may stretch into Monday, include Mr Andriessen, Mrs Carla Hills, US trade representative, Mr Ray MacSharry, EC farm commissioner, and Mr Ed Madigan, US agriculture secretary. The biggest obstacles are how far payments to EC farmers in compensation for big price cuts agreed in the recent Common Agricultural Policy reform should be exempt from cuts under the Uruguay Round 'final act'; how far the EC must cut its subsidised farm exports, and the amount of subsidy; and how to ensure a 'peace accord', whereby the US agrees to forgo future retaliation against what it considers unfair competition. Mr Andriessen said yesterday he had a clear mandate from the Council of Ministers meeting this week in Luxembourg to negotiate, even if it meant taking some risks.</p>

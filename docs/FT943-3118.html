			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Holiday Inn hotels brand change Holiday Inn is to remove its name from its luxury Crowne Plaza hotels which will now be marketed as a separate brand. The change will apply initially to Crowne Plaza hotels in the Americas only. However, Mr Bryan Langton, Holiday Inn chairman, said he expects the change to be extended to the rest of the world eventually. This would follow consultation with hotel owners in Europe and Asia, he said. Mr Langton said the decision followed market research which indicated that the Holiday Inn brand should not be extended to top-range hotels. The company, which is owned by Bass, the UK brewing and leisure group, is also introducing two new hotel brands in the Americas. The first is Holiday Inn Select, which will consist of business hotels in cities and suburban areas. The second will be Holiday Inn Hotel and Suites which will cater for longer-stay guests. Mount Charlotte Thistle, the UK hotel company which is majority owned by Brierley Investments of New Zealand, is to market its Thistle and Mount Charlotte hotels as two separate groups. The holding companies for the hotels will be Thistle Hotels and Mount Charlotte Hotels and the holding company for both will be Mount Charlotte Investments.</p>

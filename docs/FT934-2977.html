			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / International Company News: Hughes Aircraft to build Dollars 660m satellite system Hughes Aircraft, the General Motors aerospace subsidiary which is the world's largest owner and operator of satellites, is to build a Dollars 660m satellite system to provide specialised telecommunications services in the US market. The company said it has applied to the Federal Communications Commission for permission to launch and operate two satellites in 1998. The satellites will service a system called Spaceway, which will provide residential and business subscribers with specialised services such as two-way video telephones and interactive computer transmissions. Although Spaceway is intended to supplement terrestrial telecommunication, Hughes said it could eventually compete directly with ground-based telephone line and cable systems. Mr Steven Dorfman, senior vice-president of Hughes' space and telecommunications division, said Spaceway would send its signal to subscribers via satellite dishes that will be smaller and cheaper than existing dishes. Hardware that now costs between Dollars 5,000 and Dollars 10,000, could cost as little as Dollars 1,000 with Spaceway.</p>

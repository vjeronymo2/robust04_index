			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Cecilia Pachano from "The News" newscast] </F>   [Text] The Council of Ministers approved in its session  this afternoon the three first decrees contemplated in the  Special Powers Act. These decrees allowed the Council of  Ministers to promulgate the Law on Bank Debits, Law on  Concessions for Construction and Maintenance of Public Works,  and Law on Reforms of the Public Budget Law.    Regarding the Law on Bank Debits, the only modification made  to the original draft bill was that stock market operations will  only be taxed for first operations and will maintain the 0.75  percent profitability rate. This law will go into effect on 2  May. The government hopes to collect 100 billion bolivares with  its implementation.    Regarding the Law on Concessions for Construction and  Maintenance of Public Works, it is estimated its passage will  promote the construction of public works, benefiting the  community which will receive these new works and the state,  which will not disburse any money for their construction.    [Begin Guillermo Alvarez, Central Information Office  minister, recording] The profit margins offered by the past law  ranged from 40 to 45 percent of the investment, which was  evidently not attractive for investors. Now we have placed the  profit margin at 75 percent. It may even reach 90 percent  eventually with the authorization of Congress.    This is very important because it permits us to undertake  works the government would have otherwise been unable to take  on. [end recording]    As was known previously, the Law on Reforms of the Public  Budget Law only contemplates the modification in the  presentation date, which for the first quarter of the year was  moved to the first 15 days of the month of June.</p>

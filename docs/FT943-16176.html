			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / US sends Marines to Haiti waters Four US naval amphibious assault ships will sail for Haiti today, carrying 2,000 US Marines, the defence department announced yesterday. The ships are being sent to help in any evacuation of US citizens and 'designated foreign individuals' from Haiti, the department said. The amphibious assault group will join eight US warships patrolling the waters off the Caribbean nation to enforce UN sanctions against Haiti's military regime. A ninth ship - the helicopter-carrier Wasp - is also in the area for training exercises with 650 Marines aboard. A naval spokesman refused to comment on whether the ships could be used to land troops on Haitian soil. President Bill Clinton has refused to rule out the possibility of an invasion to reinstate President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, exiled after a military coup in September 1991. After Mr Clinton's decision to end all commercial air traffic between the US and Haiti, refugees have fled the nation in record numbers, often putting to sea in overcrowded and unsafe open vessels in the hope of political asylum in the US. The flood of asylum-seekers - who have left Haiti at rates sometimes reaching 1,000 per day - has forced the Clinton administration to reopen its refugee centre at Guantanamo Bay in south-eastern Cuba. The refugees - those picked at sea up by the US Coast Guard - are also being brought to naval ships serving in the Caribbean as floating processing centres, and to refugee camps on the British-owned Turks and Caicos Islands. Under current US policy, refugees are being given brief asylum hearings and those not given asylum are returned to Haiti. Panama said yesterday it would be willing to accept up to 10,000 refugees.</p>

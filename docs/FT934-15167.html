			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / Absolut loss for GrandMet in US GRAND Metropolitan is to lose US distribution rights to Absolut vodka, the Swedish-owned premium brand, which has become one of the world's best-selling spirits over the past 13 years. Vin &amp; Sprit, the Swedish wine and spirits company, yesterday announced that Seagram, the North American drinks group, would take over distribution of Absolut in the US. It would also take over distribution in other world markets as soon as contracts allowed. The reason for the switch appears to have been growing doubts at V &amp; S about the future development of Absolut alongside GrandMet's own Smirnoff and Popov brands. The decision shocked GrandMet's IDV drinks division. It was informed only 24 hours earlier. Up to then, it had been engaged in the usual review of its US distribution arrangements with V &amp; S which were due for renewal next September. Mr John McGrath, chairman and chief executive of IDV, said that the company, in 'an excellent and mutually beneficial partnership' with V &amp; S, had developed Absolut in the US from negligible sales in 1980 to almost 3m cases a year. 'Given this impressive track record, and the successful co-existence and compatibility of Absolut alongside IDV's portfolio of other US brands, including Smirnoff and Popov, it is all the more surprising that V &amp; S should take this decision.' Absolut is ranked 17th in the world's best-selling spirits and is the fifth largest brand in GrandMet's portfolio. Analysts estimate it was worth about Pounds 25m a year in profits. Its loss hit GrandMet's shares which fell 15p to close at 403p. Seagram shares rose Dollars 1/4 to Dollars 26 1/4 at midday. Mr Claes Dahlback, V &amp; S chairman, said: 'The potential for Absolut vodka and the resources of Seagram make a perfect business match: a worldwide premium brand and a worldwide premium brand marketer and distributor.' For Seagram, which does not have an international vodka brand in its portfolio, the capture of Absolut is a coup. Mr Edgar Bronfman, Seagram's president, said: 'We are very excited to have the opportunity and responsibility to join forces with V &amp; S to develop further and realise the full potential of Absolut.'

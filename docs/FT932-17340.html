			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Personal View: Budget makes waves in the North Sea In the Budget, the chancellor revealed plans to make changes to the North Sea tax system, changes which are fundamental and came without warning. The question that has to be asked is, are these proposed tax changes bad for the nation which, after all, owns the oil and gas reserves? The answer is yes, if they remain unmodified, although not necessarily for the reasons that some oil companies have been giving. The most aired argument has been that the proposed abolition of petroleum revenue tax (PRT) relief for exploration will significantly reduce drilling activity. This is undeniable, but is it bad for the nation? No. Over the past few years the likely return on total exploration expenditures, pre-tax, will prove to be negative. What has saved those more technically lax companies has been the fact that the government has been paying between 75p and 83p in the pound for most of their drilling through tax reliefs. The change in the rules should force some of the companies to become more technically focused, and appreciate more fully high-quality acreage and explorations. If the industry really wishes to argue the point about drilling, it should concentrate on the unemployment that will be created by the fall in activity. For if the abolition of the tax relief on drilling occurs as suddenly as is currently proposed, the loss of jobs within a year could be measured in thousands. For their part, some politicians might argue that the reduction in the rate of PRT on existing fields will give the oil companies a windfall profit. It is true to say that the income to companies from PRT-paying fields will increase, but this is generally no bad thing. It should ensure that many fields are kept in production for longer than they might have been previously. Equally importantly, the government's share of the cost of abandoning fields will fall as a result of the rate reduction. Why, then, are these changes bad for the nation? Simply put, they introduce considerable uncertainty to an industry which is characterised by lead times that can be measured in numbers of government life-times. Inevitably, this will reduce the attractiveness of the North Sea compared with a growing list of countries elsewhere that compete for the industry's money. One specific concern is obligation wells. When a company is awarded a licence by the government, it agrees to drill a certain number of wells in order to test the prospectiveness of that acreage. Implicitly, such an agreement is made under the assumption that tax laws of the time will remain unchanged. To change the laws after the licence award, but before such wells are drilled, is an effective breach of the underlying terms of contract. Unless the government redresses this position, it runs the serious risk of the companies paying less attention to the licensing authorities in the future. Given the increase of opportunities elsewhere, the government should realise that, longer term, it will need the companies more than they will need it. While one solution might be for the government to waive all current obligation wells, another would be to allow companies to relieve the cost of obligation wells against PRT, provided such costs are spent within two years. This is in line with government treatment for wells that are are already contracted. It would also ensure the wells are drilled and allow the unemployment that will be linked to the slowdown in exploration to be phased in over a longer period. Another concern is the abolition of PRT on new fields. While the great majority of new fields would not have paid PRT, one has to wonder whether a later government will allow those companies lucky enough to develop large fields to take home the operating income net only of corporation tax, the full rate of which is currently 33 per cent. From my perspective I would have to say that there is no chance of this happening. The real danger is that PRT will be reintroduced, or that royalty will no longer be waived or that some new form of tax will be designed. The government should, therefore, keep PRT alive for these new fields. It is a flexible, fair and known tax system. With the North Sea now well into maturity, it is right for the government to consider making some changes to the fiscal regime, and the direction that it is now proposing is the correct one. It should, however, be more ethical in the phasing-in of the abolition of the exploration relief, and should reconsider the idea of abolishing PRT for new fields. Failure to make these changes will result in a gradual run-down of this important domestic industry.

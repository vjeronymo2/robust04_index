			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / International Company News: CBoT trading offer rivals NY The Chicago Board of Trade and Bloomberg, the financial information group, are to join forces to provide the CBoT with an electronic foothold in the huge cash market for US government securities. The CBoT has highly successful futures and options contracts on US Treasury bonds and notes, and for the past two years has sought to augment this with a move into the underlying cash markets. It has attempted to launch Chicago Board Brokerages, an electronic exchange for cash instruments. But the venture has yet to receive approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The CBoT now hopes to team up with New York-based Bloomberg to offer electronic government securities trading to its members and member firms on Bloomberg terminals around the world. Trades would be cleared by another CBoT subsidiary, the Clearing Corporation for Options and Securities. The venture would compete directly with New York's established government securities broker-dealer industry. Before the venture can proceed, the exchange must first gain status as a registered broker-dealer from the National Association of Securities Dealers and its securities clearing arm must also gain SEC approval. Mr Patrick Arbor, CBoT chairman, met SEC chairman Mr Arthur Levitt last week and described the meeting as encouraging.</p>

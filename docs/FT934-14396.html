			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Travel Focus - Caribbean &amp; South America: Pirates of pleasure in pursuit of Virgins - James Henderson cruises the British Virgin Islands in search of beaches, beer, and blondes IT WAS as though the yachts in the Sir Francis Drake Channel were choreographed. Suddenly, from their haphazard headings, they all went about and converged on Cooper Island, a scrubby spit of land where there is nothing but a trendy beach bar. Word had just gone out on the VHF that the yacht Sea Breeze was putting in at Cooper Island for lunch. Supposedly on board there was the Swedish women's volleyball team, enjoying a bit of R&amp;R in the British Virgin Islands. The idea of 10 sleek 6ft blondes had sent the hot-blooded boys of the BVI yachting fraternity into a frenzy. A friend had brought me along for the ride and I was enjoying every priceless minute of it. We waited in vain. But Cooper Island is no bad place to pass a couple of lazy hours when the sun is at its height. It has a palm-fronted strand and a bar, peopled by straw-haired yachties and nut-brown beach-goers. The only unsettling thing about Cooper Island is Jazz, a despotic dog who roams self-importantly over his territory. The rumours shifted with the wind. It was not a volleyball squad after all, but a team of models - even better - on a photographic shoot. Crest-fallen heads perked up and moments later the yachts were off again, this time seeking a catamaran, the name of which none of them knew. They had no luck on that score, either. Late in the day they all headed for the good ship William Thornton. The William Thornton stands in the Bight off Norman Island, a popular overnight anchorage. The ship is an elegant old Baltic trader, built in Denmark in 1915. Despite its curious-looking superstructure, its graceful wooden lines are still visible in the hull. Its days of hauling coal are long gone; instead the William Thornton does a roaring trade as a floating bar and restaurant. We ate on board, at hatch covers turned into tables. Pirates do not carouse in the Virgin Islands any longer, but the Willy T, as it is familiarly known, sells itself as a bit of a pirate ship. The bar in the poop deck (which takes its name from the early Spanish habit of lining the deck with puppet-like models of saints) has pictures of pirates and their flags. Things soon began to liven up. Noise travels well over water, and soon the yachtsmen came beetling across in their dinghies, attracted by the sound of a party. There were no Swedish girls on board, real or imitation, but there was a crowd of mad Californians around the deck (no saints these, either). As the evening progressed, and the gentle swaying of the ship began to compensate for my irregular movements, so it all became more and more boisterous. A 'bodyshot' is a rude version of a tequila shot, in which the salt, lemon and tequila are located in different places on a Californian girl, supine on the bar. There are more beach bars in the BVIs than anywhere else in the Caribbean and they have a life of their own, spontaneously bursting into activity as yachts materialise. Some have musical instruments lying around; people pick them up and play. But life, even in the BVIs, is not only beach bars, so next day I left the yachties scouring the waterways for their flock of Amazons - no mean search because there are 50-odd islands, rocks and cays in the BVIs, with scores of isolated coves where you can hide yourself away. If it is peaceful land-bound isolation that you prefer, then there are plenty of hotels and villas in which to maroon yourself. Many offer top-notch comfort; some are islands given over to a single resort. Guana Island is little-known by British visitors: it takes just 30 guests in deceptively simple rooms built of stone and scattered across the breezy hillside, all with superb views. In a typically easy Caribbean manner, the guests gather for drinks after a day on the beach and then eat with one another at dinner. Richard Branson's Necker Island can also be hired by parties of up to 20. It has a huge open-sided main house built in Balinese style, decorated with palms, oriental and Amerindian statues, an outsize snooker table and an excellent selection of CDs. The 20-seat dining table weighs three tons. Perhaps the best-known hotel among British visitors is Biras Creek, which stands at the head of the North Sound in Virgin Gorda. Here, rooms are ranged on the ocean-front. There is a rarified and elegant air about the place. As I stumbled off the launch I realised that it was time to be on my best behaviour. Easier said than done. Three days on a yacht had played havoc with my middle ear, and around me the land was rising and falling as though I was in a 3ft swell. Conversation was confusing. Anyone sitting opposite me would rock and sway as they spoke, pause, tilt and then sweep off as though in a boatswain's chair. Cycling around the grounds was little more than a joke. Presumably I gave an impression of being slightly adrift. As soon as the dizzy swell subsided it was time to get back on to the water. The Virgin Islands offer the best sailing holiday in the Caribbean. The sailing is relatively easy, the winds constant and there are isolated coves, elegant restaurants and endless beach bars, all within a couple of hours' sail of one another. The islands are not that cheap and they have lost almost any natural West Indian feel, but there is an easy mix of locals and visitors. I find that I am struck by the physical beauty of so many places in the world, but islands have a special attraction. There are places in the BVIs where the views carry over 20 or 30 miles and the islands, jumbled on one another, fade to grey in the haze. The distant peaks are no more than a faint outline scratched on the horizon. One of the beauties of sailing in the BVIs is to be completely surrounded by islands. They lie like animals around you, some curled asleep, others tense, ready to pounce. Cooper Island and Norman Island are two small islands in a line of peaks buried to their necks in water. They stand opposite Tortola, the capital island, across the Sir Francis Drake Channel, where most of the sailing takes place. But there are other areas to explore, so I headed for the other side of Tortola, to Jost van Dyke, perhaps the most natural of the main Virgin Islands. Electricity has just reached the place and the only visible industry is the mining of sand, of which there is plenty. True to form, it has its fair share of beach bars. On one beach, the mile-long stretch of Great Harbour, there are six. The proprietors lie in the sun waiting for custom. Jost van Dyke is so laid back that it can properly be described as comatose. Except at New Year, that is, when it collects as many as 2,500 sailors for a huge beach party. People come from all over the world. They drink, dance, nail their business cards to the rafters and, by midday next day, are gone; so the island returns to its slumber. White Bay, the next bay along, is a perfect Caribbean beach. The fluorescence of the windsurfers is matched by the intense turquoise of the water; the sand is so bright it hurts your eyes. It is also a good anchorage and so we hove to, ordered dinner over the VHF - 'That'll be two lobsters, a shrimp and a swordfish, please, over' - and slithered off into the sea to wallow in the shallow water. I don't know if the yachties ever did run their blonde quarry to ground, whatever it turned out to be. But it made me laugh when I came across a fearsome game of beach volleyball taking place at an out-of-the-way beach bar. I was roaring past on a motorboat, but I could see that the players were all blonde females. I nearly put it out over the VHF, but the sailors would never have got there in time. Sunsail (tel: 0705-219848) charters skippered yachts and bare boats, singly and in flotillas, for two to 10 people, in the British Virgin Islands and other Caribbean centres. In London, the BVI Tourist Board is on 071-240 4259. James Henderson is author of the Cadogan Guide to the Caribbean.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Tlie Stefan: "A Catastrophic Year is Expected </F> for Romanian  Agriculture"]    [Text] Recent data from the National Statistics Commission  on the development of the Romanian economy during the month of  February and during the first two months of the year are  extremely somber on the current situation in agriculture. The  year 1994 is expected to be the most dismal year for Romanian  agriculture which continues to suffer a real tragedy.    The situation is alarming in the vegetable sector. According  to statistical data, as of 21 March, 469,000 hectares still had  to be plowed--remember, this is plowing for spring planting!.  Only 415,000 hectares had been sown -- only 7 percent of the  planned area. The situation of the sugarbeets is the most  serious one: Only 16,000 hectares, 6 percent of the planned  area, have been sown.    Of course, some plowing and sowing has been done since 21  March so the present figure is 10 percent. But the situation in  agriculture gets worse with each passing day. This is all the  more serious since no one, neither the government nor the  Ministry of Agriculture, wants to take this year's special  weather conditions into consideration. We are referring, in  particular, to the drought which has persisted for more than 100  days throughout the country, which has reduced the water  reserves in the soil to zero. It is a very unusual situation  which required immediate measures to ensure that the irrigation  system would begin operating a month earlier than in previous  years. According to our information, if it does not rain more  regularly, in the plains, for at least two weeks, the grains,  the wheat and the barley will be completely lost and will be  dried up.    Last year 2 million hectares of crops were lost because of  lack of water. This year, if there is no intervention at the  twelfth hour to provide irrigation, it will be even worse. Faced  with this state of affairs, the ministers of agriculture plead  lack of money but, as spokesmen of the government, they continue  to promise that they will provide the necessary funds for  irrigation. When? No one knows, as long as the 1994 budget has  not been approved yet. At present, only 10 billion lei have been  allocated of the 25 billion lei which are absolutely necessary  for putting into operation the irrigation systems promised for  the first quarter. In television broadcasts, the ministers of  agriculture say that this year's drought took them by surprise.  However, we do not know the official viewpoint of the government  or its intentions. It would be normal, at least, for the  government to openly admit: "We do not have any money for  irrigation, we are hiring rainmakers."    Meanwhile, it is highly likely that Romania will import not  only wheat and sugar this year, like it has been doing up to  now, but also the entire range of agricultural products, imports  which will fatten up the ticks which are on the backs of the  governing officials and ruin Romanian agriculture.</p>

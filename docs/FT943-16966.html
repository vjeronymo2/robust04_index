			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / Hard work to be free and single: A look at the opportunities and constraints of a single European market in insurance Buy a simple 10-year-term life insurance policy in Portugal and you can expect to pay more than three times what you would spend on exactly the same contract in France. The difference demonstrates clearly the case for a single European market in insurance. From today, such big price discrepancies may begin to fade as a result of new rules freeing up restrictions on cross-border trade in the European market. But the continent's 320m consumers will not see benefits overnight. Experts inside and outside the insurance industry expect change to be slow. The European Union expects that five of its 12 member states will implement the so-called 'framework directives' by today's deadline. All but two countries - Spain and Greece - should have done so by the end of the year. The directives mark the final stage in a programme to liberalise the Dollars 470bn (Pounds 309.2bn) a year life and general insurance industry, extending changes introduced in the commercial market in 1990. The directives do two things: First, they make genuine 'cross-border' trade possible by allowing insurance companies to sell their products anywhere in the EU on the basis of regulations in their home state, the so-called 'single licence' or 'single passport'; Second, insurers throughout the EU will be allowed to set their own rates for all classes of insurance policy. They will no longer need to submit policy wordings to local officials for approval, thus effectively dismantling the highly regulated, protectionist regime behind which much of the industry has sheltered. National regulators will focus their attention on the underlying financial health of companies, following the practice already well established in the UK, the Netherlands and Ireland. 'Supervision will be based on the undertaking itself, its solvency, its shareholders, its management - and no longer on its products or its rates,' says Mr Francis Loheac, secretary general of the Comite Europeen des Assurances, the European industry association. Today's directives are the culmination of legislation started in the 1970s, which gave European companies the right to set up subsidiaries throughout the Common Market. An initiative approved last year, the insurance accounts directive, should make it easier for investors to compare the financial strengths of competing companies. Although many countries - notably France and Belgium - have liberalised regulations well in advance of today's changes, the rules will have an immediate impact elsewhere in the EU. The changes will lead to what Mr Loheac calls a 'veritable revolution' in Italy and Germany, the two countries slowest to adapt to a deregulated environment. For example, the two countries will be required to remove controls on their motor liability insurance rates - the sector where minimum rates still apply. The overall effect of the changes in regulatory approach will further increase competition, eroding the cartel-like arrangements through which large national companies - such as Allianz of Germany, Union des Assurances de Paris of France and Generali of Italy - have long dominated their local markets. In more regulated markets such as Germany, companies are being forced to underwrite more selectively, varying premiums in areas such as home and motor insurance according to the risk and the likelihood of a claim. New products such as unit-linked life insurance contracts, which offer consumers potentially greater returns on their investment, are being introduced. 'Our companies are now competitors. Before, it wasn't seen as gentlemanly to be envious of the market share of a rival,' says Mr Wautier Robyns de Schneidauer, an adviser to the Belgian Union of Insurers, which introduced new rules in 1991. Nevertheless, despite the injection of greater competition into the industry, price differentials are likely to stay in place for the immediate future. Mr Jean-Paul Coteur, a legal adviser for Test-Achats, the Belgian consumers' association, says he has had to disappoint dozens of recent callers anxious to benefit from lower prices. 'I have to tell them that it won't be possible to go abroad,' he says. 'They know they can get it cheaper but it won't be possible. We've had a dozen people a week ringing us over the last six months.' Factors ranging from price, to local tax and legal conditions and consumer buying patterns will conspire to hold up implementation of a true single market. First, the incidence of claims varies widely across the EU. For instance, motor insurers must take into account varying degrees of road safety and different levels of court awards to accident victims across member states. Second, the level of service offered by insurers can differ. 'Belgian consumers expect their brokers to drive to their homes at all hours of the day to settle claims. I don't know whether that makes economic sense or not but that is what people have come to expect,' Mr Robyns explains. Third, despite the common regulatory framework of today's directive, legal disparities remain. Some classes of insurance - kidnap and ransom policies in Italy, for example - are illegal in parts of the EU. There are fears that interpretations by national regulators of the 'general good' - a Europe-wide legal principle could restrict the commercial freedom of companies despite the provisions of the single licence. Moves to vary premium rates for certain classes of customer could be seen as discriminating against groups such as ethnic minorities. Fourth, variations in tax regimes will have an impact on life insurance business because sales are often driven by tax advantages. While restrictions to cross-border sales have been lifted by the new directive, a European Court ruling of 1992 keeps others in place. Individual member states can still limit the scope of tax advantages to some life insurers. Mr Jean-Pierre Fevre, director of financial institutions at the European Commission, says 'it will take a long time to deal with the tax differences. We have to reach a compromise between people's freedom to contract services and the rights of tax authorities to collect money.' Fifth, cultural factors will also inhibit cross-border trade. Most continental insurers market home, life and motor insurance through networks of exclusive local agents, who enjoy long-term and loyal relationships with customers. Many people are thus unlikely to switch companies on price alone. Mr Tony Baker, deputy director-general of the Association of British Insurers, expects inter-EU trade to be restricted to specialised niches, such as sophisticated investment policies for wealthy individuals. Despite all these constraints the directive opens up long-term opportunities for insurance companies to penetrate each other's national markets. But to do so, they are likely to be forced to set up operations elsewhere rather than to rely on cross-border trade. In particular, control of retail outlets will be essential if products are to be sold successfully. Thus mergers and acquisitions are gathering pace. EU reports on competition policy show a constant 20 per cent annual growth in the number of insurance company mergers as the pace of takeover activity in the sector picks up. A flurry of recent purchases, which has seen Union des Assurances de Paris, France's biggest insurer, buy Germany's Colonia for about FFr20bn (Pounds 2.36bn) and Switzerland's Winterthur buy DBV of Germany for an estimated DM900m, culminated in early June with the announcement by Commercial Union of the UK that it proposed to pay Fr12.5bn for France's Victoire. Mergers are not the only strategy, however. Recently, in a bid to enter the German market, companies such as Zurich of Switzerland and Axa of France have started to focus on forming direct telephone sales offshoots, following the success of similar methods developed in the UK by Direct Line and others. Ultimately, these strategies are likely to spur the development of a single market. But it will not depend for success on customers' response to the cheaper and more attractive products on offer. Rather, the pace of change will depend on the level of corporate activity and the ability and willingness of individual companies to take risks in exploiting a more open environment.  ------------------------------------------- EUROPE'S INSURANCE MARKET: HARD TO HARMONISE  ------------------------------------------- Average premiums (Ecu)  -------------------------------------------         Experienced driver      Young driver         with a good record,   Seat Ibiza 1.2         Peugeot 405 1.6 (Ecu)  ------------------------------------------- Ireland           585                  1,821 Belgium           394                    480 Luxembourg        367                    372 Germany           304                    957 France            237                    806 Italy             219                    375 Spain             212                    718 Denmark           192                    446 Netherlands       159                    473 Portugal          157                    287 Great Britain     135                    667 Greece            127                    155  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Bureau European des Unions de Consommateurs; 1992 figures  ----------------------------------------------------------------</p>

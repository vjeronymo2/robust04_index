			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / Letter: Engineers' low status key factor behind UK industry's problems Sir, Your article on the state of UK engineering ('Machines in need of maintenance', April 14) omits one of the major reasons for the problem: the status, and indeed identity, of British engineers. Whereas our colleagues in the US, Japan and the rest of Europe have the professional standing and wages at least equal to doctors and accountants, most British people associate the word 'engineer' with someone who works in a garage. Engineering salaries, meanwhile, are far lower than in other countries or in other professions in the UK. It is thus no surprise that so many British engineering graduates go into the financial sector, a move that would be unthinkable here in France. Applications for engineering courses are also falling, against the national trend. Will this change? When an unskilled worker is dissatisfied, he or she can take industrial action. An engineer, however, can easily swap either profession or country. The current changes in Europe make the latter option increasingly attractive. There is no easy solution. But without engineers to design new products, no amount of help from Mr Heseltine will save our industry. J Ledger, ESIEE Grande Ecole, BP 99, 93162 Noisy-le-Grand, France</p>

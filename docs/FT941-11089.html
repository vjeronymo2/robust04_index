			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / Cigarette plant to close Philip Morris, the US company that makes Marlboro, the world's biggest-selling cigarette, is to close its cigarette factory in the Ixelles area of Brussels because of the decline of smoking in the European Union, Richard Tomkins writes from New York. The closure will cost 275 jobs, but will not affect the distribution of Marlboro and other Philip Morris brands in the EU. The company said it would continue to supply the market from its other EU factories. Philip Morris Belgium, the group's Belgian subsidiary, said EU consumption of cigarettes fell 7 per cent between 1990 and 1993, and a further decline was expected this year.</p>

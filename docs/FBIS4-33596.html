			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle by </F> correspondent Raquel Correa; place and date not given --  passages between italics are editorial commentary]    [Text] President Frei says he is "at easy and  relaxed" despite his turbulent first two months in government.  He was even accused of being "frivolous," something no one  would have ever thought of him.    [Frei] If I go out, people say I am "marketing." If I do not  go out, they will say I am living in a capsule.    [Correa] Which of these two evils do you prefer?    [Frei] I prefer frivolity to isolation. He smiles    He looks very young in the solemn halls of La Moneda  Palace, but he has the dignity proper of a head of state. The  difference begins with his formal treatment of people. The Frei  of "the new times" little resembles the old Frei. He  stresses:    [Frei] I am the same person I have always been.    Some people criticize him because he goes to see his  soccer team (The "U" Universidad de Chile) play, and he  answers:    [Frei] What do they expect? I have gone to watch soccer  matches all my life. Why would I stop now?    He was also criticized while being treated at a clinic,  while he was president-elect, for coming to the window wearing  pajamas with his wife.    [Frei] Had I been operated on four years ago, nobody would  have cared. But I was president-elect and a lot of reporters  started gathering in the street outside. I came out to greet  them so they could see that I was alright, that I did not have  cancer or anything else serious.    [Correa] And the controversial picture of a shoe-polisher at  your feet?    [Frei] I have had my shoes polished in the streets my entire  life. The only difference is that this time they took a  picture. Frei says with the logic of the civil engineer he  is. I do not prepare shows. The shoe-polisher event  happened because it was a day of public audiences and there were  photographers around.    He says nothing has really bothered him since he came  to power. He sleeps seven or eight hours every night and half an  hour after lunch in the bedroom beside his office. Then he  walks out renewed.    [Correa] Did the Stange [Carabineros Chief Rodolfo Stange]  affair disturb your sleep?    [Frei] Not at all.    The teachers' strike did not keep him awake either.    [Correa] Are you annoyed by criticism? What about the  criticism from the opposition and from the coalition? Do you  dismiss it or do you study it?    [Frei] It depends. If it is made in good faith, I receive it  well. I do not like negative criticism. I do not even consider  it. I think about criticism based on a valid point. I ponder  and analyze myself a lot.    [Correa] Do you think your popularity has increased or  decreased since you came to power?    [Frei] I do not know. All I know is that I have been warmly  received everywhere I go.    [Correa] Are you getting used to being president?    [Frei] It is a lot of work he replies with grace  but I enjoy working.    [Correa] Did you say working with former President Augusto  Pinochet?    [Frei] No. He understands the joke immediately and  smiles.    [Correa] What is the best thing about being president?    [Frei] First, I have the opportunity to do things, solve  problems; second, I enjoy people's support. In a more personal  area, I like to rest at the Vina del Mar presidential residence.  Besides, the palace brings to my mind many memories. Memories  of my father when he was president, when I was dating Martita.    [Correa] What do you resent the most?    [Frei] The lack of time for myself. I must work 12, 14, 16  hours.    [Correa] Are you paid well?    [Frei] It would embarrass me to show you my paycheck. If I  tell you how much I make people will say I am "marketing."    [Correa] How much?    [Frei] Seven hundred forty eight thousand pesos, after  deductions. Grade one level.    [Correa] You also receive expenses and representation  allowances...    [Frei] Yes. Here all expenditures are considered expenses.  We have a budget for the presidency and all expenditures are  considered expenses. This should be changed and we should have  a current account. This matter of expenses is absurd.    [Correa] Some people have compared your wife to Hillary  Clinton. How do you think Martita Frei is doing as the first  lady?    [Frei] She is a very dedicated worker, she is working hard  with new ideas, new projects. I believe the people value her  contribution at the institutions over which she presides?    [Correa] Have you felt the loneliness that comes with power?    [Frei] Very little. In my position one has to deal with  sudden developments all the time. My intercom is always open  and the ministers all call me at any time. In the beginning,  one tends to get too involved in the details but soon enough one  realizes that one must focus on the essence. I hardly have any  time to be alone and sometimes one needs some quiet time alone  to read, to think, to ponder, to rest.    [Correa] Would you say that this administration is still  going through a break-in period?    [Frei] A very important goal was reached on 21 May. From the  very beginning we set ourselves very specific objectives, among  them poverty as our first priority. We now have a well  coordinated inter-ministerial team.    [Correa] Was that the job of the Planning and Coordination  Ministry?    [Frei] Poverty is a multisector issue. This week, we started  the National Poverty Commission. We also assumed a firm  position regarding ethical standards and honesty, so this  commission is working very effectively.    [Correa] Do you believe commissions guarantee honesty?    [Frei] No... Honesty can be guaranteed through a set of  proposals which the commission is preparing. These proposals  call for legal and administrative changes. The commission will  establish regulations on incompatible activities and  disqualifying circumstances. The commission has representatives  from all branches of government: the chairman of the Senate, the  chairman of the Supreme Court, the comptroller general, the  State Defense Council. This issue has received international  support and we have been asked to bring it up at the  Ibero-American Summit which will take place in Miami in December.    [Correa] So the break-in period is over?    [Frei] That is up to the people to judge. We have set our  priorities and have done so considering historical  circumstances. Our actions have been well received by the people.    [Correa] Members of the Coalition of Parties for Democracy  [CPPD] have been complaining that your message to Congress, your  so-called "navigation chart" was better received by the  opposition than by your own supporters.    [Frei] This is a groundless complaint. The presidential  message to Congress outlined at least 16 bills already being  processed and some 50 other initiatives that will be launched  over the next 18 months. I would say that the break-in period  is over. But the period was necessary. In any human endeavor,  one must get the team together, get the people involved,  establish trust and loyalty.    [Correa] Is the CPPD loyal to you?    [Frei] It has to be. During my electoral campaign I talked a  great deal about the lack of loyalty my father had to endure.  Perhaps the enormous number of votes I received was due to my  steadfast loyalty to President Aylwin's administration.    [Correa] Your father tried to carry out a "revolution in  freedom;" while your predecessor Patricio Aylwin proposed a  government for "national reconciliation." What is the slogan of  your administration?    [Frei] I would like my administration to be remembered for  its struggle against poverty and marginalization. On a broader  scale, I would like to take advantage of this historic  opportunity Chile has to further its development.    [Correa] Critics from within the administration and the  opposition have been saying that your administration has no set  course of action, nor leadership. They say it is obvious that  you have no political experience. What is your answer?    [Frei] What is the point of defending myself? Let the people  be the judges. We have established certain goals and deadlines  for the 70 days prior to our message to Congress which contains  a set of definitions.    [Correa] Do you think your government has wasted 70 days...?    [Frei] I do not think the country has lost 70 days. We  could review each sector separately... For example, Codelco  [Copper Corporation]. In what state was it when we came to  government? What is its situation now?    We submitted a draft bill to Congress to modernize the most  important Chilean enterprise, to make it more efficient. By  eliminating the operations management in Santiago, Codelco has  already changed radically. The mining district managers are now  the top managers of the respective enterprises. In less than 70  days, we submitted to Congress a draft bill heading in the right  direction.    This week he continues we closed a deal that will  entail an investment of more than $1 million. In the public  works sector, we have called for bids for two or three  significant projects and other important ones will be called  soon. We progressed in the fields of poverty, health, and  regionalization. We will double regional investments. We have  tackled the vital Arica and Magallanes problems because we do  not avoid our problems... We have decidedly progressed in the  privatization project.    [Correa] Are you talking about LAN [Chilean National  Airline], and the electricity company...?    [Frei] Obviously. The problems affecting LAN, Northern  Electricity Company, and State Maritime Enterprise have been  solved. We will continue on this path.    [Copper] Everything except the privatization of Codelco?    [Frei] We believe Codelco's four most important mining  districts should remain in the state's hands.    [Correa] What about Colbun-Machicura?    [Frei] We might privatize it. Enterprises that are not  monopolies and which need great investments, which the state  cannot afford, might be privatized. For example, in the health  sector, Chile currently spends 4 or 5 percent of its GDP but, do  you know how much we invest in the health sector? Eighty million  dollars. Should I invest $40 million to get Empremar on its  feet again? No. The private sector must do that.    But he continues, drinking a glass of mineral  water no one should expect the government to solve in just  70 days problems that have existed for more than 70 years, like  the coal mining sector. No one can expect us to solve the health  and education problems in 70 days. We are identifying the great  problems that need to be solved. It would have been very easy  for us to say: In the education field let us submit a draft bill  to Congress referring to subsidies and easy problems, without  tackling the core of the problem. We must tackle the core of  the problem in the education field or we will remain an  underdeveloped country. We must increase teaching hours.    [Correa] Will the reform of the Teachers Statutes include  the  elimination of the clause by which teachers cannot be replaced?    [Frei] We do not want to dismiss teachers. We want to  expand the teaching hours, which means we need more teachers.  But they must be redistributed. Changes are feasible through  dialogue.    [Correa] The teachers maintain the government did not  consult  them before submitting the draft bill to Congress...    [Frei] They wanted a private dialogue first and this is what  we did. We never interrupted the dialogue. But, definitely, no  one can say that in these 70 past days, we have not tackled  crucial problems.    [Correa] People believe you are distant regarding important  problems. You never publicly stated your opinion regarding  Stange, the teachers problem, the negotiations over the minimum  salary...    [Frei] We work as a team and are constantly evaluating. The  president makes the decisions and this is what I have been  doing. If I had not been involved in the important issues, I  would have not signed the draft bill regarding the Teacher's  Statutes. I have been involved in the main decisions. As for  publicly disclosing decisions, I am not the government  spokesman. I am here to work and make decisions with a true  national meaning.    What did I do on my first visit to Concepcion? I  acknowledged the coal miners' problem. Do not tell me I have  been aloof. We are negotiating, working on the subject and will  make a series of proposals. The same goes for Arica.  Obviously, economic issues are dealt with through permanent  contact with the finance minister.    [Correa] You said you would assess the public servants 180  days after you came to power. Will you change any ministers?    [Frei] When I said that I referred to all public servants,  so  why should some ministers not be replaced?    [Correa] And will they be removed?    [Frei] I have been putting together an excellent team. I am  very pleased with it, but it goes without saying that the post  of minister entails the president of the Republic's trust.  Ministers stay in their posts as long as they have the  president's confidence.    [Correa] Your political team has come under fire on charges  that it is not a real team, that it is not well-structured, that  there are internal struggles. Do you believe it is a matter of  time or is there a problem of incompatibility of temperaments?    [Frei] Whenever there is a new administration, there is  obviously a period of adjustment. So far, we have been engaged  in that. The important thing is that there is loyalty,  coherence, and respect. We have had to confront difficult  situations, but I am convinced the people will become aware of  the political team's worth.    [Correa] Who is your "right-hand man"?    [Frei] Right-hand man? he asks, somewhat surprised.    [Correa] The interior minister, the minister secretary  general of the Presidency, or the defense minister ...?    [Frei] It is said that I am closer to this one or that one  ... I have been a friend of Defense Minister Edmundo Perez since  I was seven ... When one is president, the relationship with  one's aides goes beyond the realm of personal friendships. I  get on well with all of them ... There is no "right-hand man,"  rather a working team ... Each ministry has its specific  function. People are always willing to create differences ...  In the beginning, it was said: "The president makes mistakes."  It was then said: "It is not the president, it is his aides who  make mistakes." I do not believe in those things. We are  working as a team, which was reflected in the 21 May state of  the nation address. Obviously one can make mistakes.    [Correa] And yet, what mistakes are you willing to  acknowledge? The "Stange Case" for example?    [Frei] In that case, I made a decision, period. I assume my  responsibility as chief of the team, as president of the  Republic.    [Correa] Would you have acted the same way if Pinochet had  been the affected party?    [Frei] I do not work on hypotheses.    [Correa] When Aylwin assumed office as president, he  requested Pinochet's resignation, why did you not do the same?  Are you pleased with having him as the commander in chief?    [Frei] I reiterate that this is not a personal issue. Power  has an impersonal stamp. I swore allegiance to the Constitution  and the law and I shall abide by them. We do not have the  necessary quorum to change that situation and we have an  excellent relationship with the commanders in chief. We are  currently working on major definitions for the future that will  benefit the country.    [Correa] And yet, would you rather Gen. Pinochet went?    [Frei] This is not a matter of indulging oneself to  something  one wants. I am here to command the nation.    [Correa] Why was the issue of human rights conspicuously  absent from the state of the union address?    [Frei] I mentioned it twice during my speech.    [Correa] Do you believe, as Aylwin said at La Sorbonne  University, that what happened concerning human rights under the  military regime was the worst tragedy that this country had ever  had to endure?    [Frei] Before becoming president, I said I would not comment  on what others said. Least of all will I comment on what former  President Aylwin said now that I am in the driver's seat.  Everyone may voice his own personal views.    [Correa] And yet, from a personal standpoint, do you not  believe this was Chile's worst tragedy ...?    [Frei] I was elected president to govern the country with my  eyes set on the 21st century. My political and historical  judgment on those events are public knowledge. I have voiced  them on many occasions. The issue of human rights is not  closed. Great strides were made under the previous  administration. The courts are at present dealing with those  lawsuits and we will endorse their judgment on those cases.    [Correa] Would you propose that the country forgets about it  once and for all?    [Frei] We have never talked about closing the issue.    [Correa] Do you believe that only one person is responsible  for Codelco's [Copper Corporation's] loss of $270 million?    [Frei] I believe no one can be solely responsible for  anything in a company as large as Codelco. Right now, we are  doing everything possible to make sure it does not happen again.    [Correa] What do you think about the constitutional charges  against former Finance Minister Alejandro Foxley?    [Frei] I believe the charges against Foxley and against  Hales  [Alejandro Hales, mining minister under the Aylwin  administration], are essentially political. It is not my place  to pass judgment on the powers of other branches of government.  I can say, however, that I know them both, and they are very  honest and committed to public service.    [Correa] Is Foxley your candidate for president of the  Christian Democratic Party [PDC]?    [Frei] I have no candidates.    [Correa] You have not, however, ceased to be an active PDC  member. Are you going to vote?    [Frei] I have said that I was not prepared to comply with  the  responsibilities and duties of active members. It is not my  place to do so. Most probably, I will not vote at all. I am  interested only in the unity of the party. I would not he  smiles do anything at all that could hurt the party. All I  want is for the party electoral process to develop  democratically, so that we can have a strong party loyal to the  administration.    [Correa] How would you explain to a foreigner that the  Chilean president is unable to dismiss the chief of police?    [Frei] This is how things are. In 1988, we accepted the fact  that we would be returning to democracy within a legal framework  in order to make whatever constitutional changes necessary once  we took over. In any democratic country in the world, the  president has the power to appoint or replace the chief of  police. This issue has not been resolved yet. We did, however,  swear to obey the Constitution and the laws.    [Correa] How can you explain to any human being the fact  that  you are not even trying to change these laws that you believe to  be undemocratic?    [Frei] We do not have the majority in Congress to do so. To  send a bill to this effect would be, at this stage, a formal  gesture. Not even in the Chamber of Deputies do we have the  majority necessary to make this constitutional amendment. At  this stage we have decided to aim at two large reforms:  modernizing Congress, and reorganizing municipalities nationwide.    [Correa] As president of the nation, what is your position  on  the inability to remove the commanders in chief of the Armed  Forces services?    [Frei] I believe it to be essential for a democratic  president to have the power to appoint and remove the commanders  in chief of the Armed Forces services.    [Correa] Do you mean to say that if during your term in  office you never obtain the required congressional majority in  Congress, you will not send the bills to reform the Constitution  to Congress?    [Frei] These issues will undergo substantial changes in  1997.  I believe they should be debated calmly. As of that date, the  commanders in chief will stay in office four years.    [Correa] What about the designated senators?    [Frei] This issue is part of the modernization of Congress.  Let us discuss this issue now, not in 1997 when many people will  want the president to appoint the senators he is entitled to by  law. Is that what we want? It is neither proper nor democratic.    [Frei] If no amendment eliminating designated senators is  passed, will you appoint the ones you are entitled to?    [Correa] If I am faced with this situation, yes, I will. I  do not believe, however, that it would be the right thing to do.    [Correa] Does this mean, Mr. President, that you want to do  away with the positions of designated senators before 1997?    [Frei] No. I want the positions eliminated in 1997. It will  take time, however, to get the electoral reform approved. It is  better to begin now and do things calmly.    [Correa] Under these circumstances, would you say that Chile  is enjoying full democracy, or is it still in transition?    [Frei] We are obviously enjoying full democracy, even though  there are some constitutional issues, like the ones I mentioned,  that need to be resolved. Our main issue nowadays is something  else: How can we improve the democratic system for the future?    [Correa] Would you contend that the president of the  Republic is the highest authority in Chile when he cannot remove  the Armed Forces commanders in chief?    [Frei] The Armed Forces are carrying out an absolutely  professional task, which is respectful of the sovereign power  that has been legitimately established. I have an excellent and  very smooth relationship with the Armed Forces. For us, to put  an end to the irremovability of the commanders in chief is a  matter of principle, but given the present state of affairs the  current situation is absolutely normal.    [Correa] What is your opinion of the fact that Army officers  who are facing charges of human rights violations are still on  active duty?    [Frei] Legal actions are bound to conclude, and one has to  respect the courts' judgment. That is the role of the courts.    [Correa] And yet what is your opinion of the fact that  officers who are being prosecuted are still on active duty?    [Frei] It is always difficult to prejudge if one does not  have a thorough knowledge of the lawsuits. The important thing  is that those legal actions take place, and that a sentence be  passed, and that the people realize that there is an independent  branch of government (the judiciary) and an administration that  respects it.    [Correa] It has been said that you left the Stange issue in  the hands of the defense minister, your fellow party member  Edmundo Perez Yoma, because you do not trust Interior Minister  German Correa because he is a Socialist, and this something the  Armed Forces abhors.    [Frei] Look, when I decided to appoint German Correa I was  perfectly aware that I was going to endure difficulties and  complications.    [Correa] Do you believe it was a mistake to appoint him?    [Frei] No, quite the contrary. As time goes by, I am more  and more convinced that it was not a mistake. No one is banned  from any posts in Chile. We are talking about the future, not  the past. I give German Correa my wholehearted support for his  loyalty and his work as interior minister. I am very happy with  him, and if I had to appoint a cabinet, I would designate him  again to the Interior Ministry.    [Correa] Why are you hiding him, then?    [Frei] I am not hiding him at all. Quite the contrary, he  enjoys my full support. He has worked very effectively  regarding Carabineros operations... It seems that the issue of  the security of citizens, an issue that was so much discussed,  has been forgotten in the country, whereas previously it was  insistently demanded... It is obvious that there are people that  are shooting on both sides of the line. This is like a  political terrorism based on rumors. This is bad for the country  and for democracy. I am very happy with the work German Correa  is doing.    [Correa] Based on analyses and opinions on the issue, we can  deduce there is widespread consensus that the government  mishandled the Stange situation. Do you believe this criticism  is correct?    [Frei] Let us review the situation. sighs First  of all, the situation concerning Gen. Stange is not the  responsibility of this administration. It is a process that  started in 1985 when three professionals were slain. The entire  country is aware of how the incidents developed. The court case  is over; Carabineros members have been sentenced by the courts.    Second, we uphold the Constitution and the law. The  president is not empowered to change the Carabineros commander.  Third, there is the organizational issue. We believe the  Carabineros are not part of the Armed Forces; and therefore they  should not be under Defense Ministry jurisdiction. In fact,  operationally the Carabineros today fall under Interior Ministry  jurisdiction. The Interior Ministry is in charge of  safeguarding the citizens' security; and therefore everything  concerning the Carabineros should be handled by the Interior  Ministry. Everything pertaining to security lies with the  Interior Ministry, but with no authority because  administratively the Carabineros fall under the jurisdiction of  the Defense Ministry. That is how the situation stands.    [Correa] If you could turn the clock back, would you again  ask Gen. Stange to retire despite the fact that the law does not  empower you to force him to go?    [Frei] I asked him to make a gesture, and I would do it  again.    [Correa] Don't you think it was a mistake to make such a  request if it depended solely on his willingness?    [Frei] When you occupy the president's chair, you have to  make decisions. Gestures are also very important.    [Correa] Who advised you to make this request?    [Frei] I assume full responsibility in this regard. I am the  president of the Republic, and I discussed the issue directly  with Gen. Stange. The easiest thing to do would have been to  entrust this task to someone else, but as a government leader I  assume full responsibility.    [Correa] You mentioned moral reasons. Do you feel your  authority as a ruler has been undermined?    [Frei] Absolutely not. I am not empowered to do this, but  for the sake of the integrity of institutions and for the good  of the government, I did the proper thing.    [Correa] Honestly speaking, do you trust Stange?    [Frei] This is not a personal problem. I am fulfilling my  role as president of the Republic, and he as done the same as  Carabineros director general. Each one, in compliance with the  responsibilities established in the Constitution and the law,  makes his own decisions.    [Correa] My question was whether or not you trust Stange?    [Frei] I refer to the official government statements.    [Correa] Do you think he seriously failed in his military  duties?    [Frei] That has to be determined by the courts.    [Correa] If this has to be determined by the courts, why  then  was Stange asked to resign before the courts issued a verdict?    [Frei] Because it entailed a court case that has lasted nine  years; for the sake of good government; for the sake of the  integrity of the Carabineros.    [Correa] Based on these words, we can conclude that Stange  does not enjoy your trust and that he seriously failed in his  duties.    [Frei] I did not say that. Everything is stated clearly in  the official government statement.    [Correa] If the courts declare him innocent, do you still  think he should retire?    [Frei] I cannot comment on a theory, only on facts. What has  been said suffices. The entire country is well aware of my  position on this issue. There are no more comments to make on  the issue.    [Correa] Specifically, how will this issue be resolved? Will  it be indefinitely postponed?    [Frei] We will try to reach a consensus.    [Correa] Why did you leave out the paragraph on Gen. Stange  from your 21 May address?    [Frei] Because it was 80 pages long and I only read 40. I  decided which paragraphs were worthy of reading.    [Correa] Have you decided on a solution to this problem or  will you continue to improvise?    [Frei] No, everything regarding the Carabineros has already  been said.    [Correa] What has your administration decided regarding  Chile  joining Mercosur [Common Market of the South]    [Frei] Our international economic policy is based on an open  regionalism. We are interested in achieving Latin American  integration. This is why in the past few years we have  concentrated our efforts on achieving bilateral agreements, but  in today's world there are other realities, such as NAFTA, APEC  [Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation], and the European Union.  Today, Mercosur is one of the most dynamic groups in Latin  America. Chile has sharply increased its exports to Latin  America; almost two-thirds of our manufactured export goods go  to the Latin American market. Within this context, Argentina  and Brazil are our main partners. Trade between Chile and  Mercosur members has increased more than five-fold in the last  six or seven years. Moreover, Mercosur is negotiating with the  EU; therefore, we cannot be left out of this market.    [Correa] Mr. President, what is the meaning of all this?  That Chile will join Mercosur?    [Frei] We have not proposed joining Mercosur. We will  propose the establishment of free trade zone within the  framework of this regionalization opened between Chile and  Mercosur. We are very interested in this, and we believe it is  an issue of utmost importance. We are drafting a proposal to be  submitted at the Cartagena de Indias Ibero-American Summit to be  held next month, based on these terms. I will attend the Rio  Group meeting that will be held in September, and in December we  will be meeting with President Clinton at the Summit of the  Americas. Moreover, there is also the trip to Jakarta, where  Chile will be admitted to APEC. We obviously want to play a  preponderant role at the regional level. Latin American  integration plays a fundamental part in Chilean foreign policy.    [Correa] Is joining NAFTA a government priority?    [Frei] Chile exports almost one-third of its GDP; it cannot  be absent from big markets. Our presence in APEC; the start of  formal negotiations with the United States to achieve a free  trade agreement; and our relation with the EU and regional  markets are the guidelines of our foreign economic policy.  Within this framework, we believe it is essential to  consolidate our integrationist position in Latin America. We  are part of this region; they are our neighbors. It is our  culture. They receive two-thirds of our manufactured exports.  Individually, our countries have little to say before large  economic groups -- APEC, EU, and NAFTA -- therefore inasmuch as  we can consolidate a free trade region and all the multinational  initiatives in which Chile takes part, I believe we are treading  on the right path.    [Correa] Does the government plan to achieve bilateral  agreements with those Latin American countries with which there  are not any, such as Ecuador and Brazil?    [Frei] This is very important. Our experiences with those  countries with which we have signed bilateral agreements have  been extraordinarily successful. We can cite Mexico, and  particularly Argentina, where Chilean investments total $1  billion; there are also binational undertakings such as the oil  pipeline dedicated by President Menem and President Aylwin; and  a gas pipeline project that will demand a significant  investment. We have just undertaken studies to build a tunnel  that will demand significant investment from our two countries.  All this goes to prove that bilateral agreements work. This  does not mean we are overlooking multilateral agreements. This  is why we are members of the Rio Group; why we want to establish  a free trade region within the framework of Mercosur; and why we  are members of Latin American Integration Association.    [Correa] Chilean agriculture is worried about Chile's  possible membership in NAFTA.    [Frei] A country like ours cannot be absent from these great  opportunities. We will achieve this safeguarding national  interests; we will see whether we will only join a free trade  agreement or also join NAFTA. This will be decided in the next  stage. Negotiations are just starting. I believe this will be  very beneficial for Chile in the long term, as we are an  exporting country. President Clinton will be announcing within  the next three or four months what countries the United States  can achieve these kind of agreements with. Only then will  negotiations be undertaken prior to congressional approval. All  interested parties -- and of course agriculture -- will be  represented in these negotiations.    [Correa] You hope to lower the inflation rate to one digit.  On a scale of one to nine, which digit? Frei laughs.    [Frei] As we engineers like to say: leaning more toward zero  and he draws a descending arrow on a pad of paper.  In view of the current national economic situation, we are  interested in basically maintaining a macroeconomic balance.  Everything that has been achieved, with so much effort, will be  safeguarded fiercely. There are corporate interests. It is our  duty to maintain this balance. Inflation, among them, is an  important factor because it has a great impact on wage and  salary earners. The country can be certain that we will be  inflexible in this regard.    [Correa] In your message, you estimated an 11 percent  inflation rate for 1994. Do you believe it is necessary to  extend the economic adjustment process?    [Frei] I believe that the economic adjustment process is  almost completed. This is why we hope to achieve an average  annual economic growth of 5.5 percent during my administration.    [Correa] It will be 3.4 percent this year.    [Frei] Four to 4.5 percent. We will be quite inflexible  regarding fiscal expenses. We will not be pressured by any  national group. Balances will be maintained; we will struggle  to achieve a low inflation rate. To overcome poverty, we must  develop and grow. There is no other way. The entire country is  aware of the economic conditions in which we inherited the  country; that an economic adjustment was implemented; and that  all the figures are showing that the economic adjustment period  is ending. We have been extremely careful regarding government  spending, and we will continue to be so.    [Correa] Mr. President, the only way to curb inflation is to  lower fiscal spending, which in the previous administration  totaled an average of 7.5 percent while economic growth totalled  6.5 percent.    [Frei] We will be inflexible regarding taxes, monetary  matters, inflation, and fiscal spending,, too. The country  cannot spend more than the GDP. We will maintain a fiscal  balance; there will be no deficit.    [Correa] What measures will be implemented if inflation is  not curbed?    [Frei] All the ones that are necessary to achieve a  one-digit  inflation rate within a prudent period of time.</p>

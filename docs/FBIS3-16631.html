			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vyacheslav Yelagin and Valentin Ovsyannikov: </F> "`Synchronizing Watches' in the Skyscraper on Smolensk Square"]    [Text] The enlarged session of the Russian Federation  Foreign Ministry Foreign Policy Council involving eminent  Russian political scientists and parliamentarians has rapidly  become a feature of the Russian diplomatic department's  activity. This shows that it is not screened off from its  opponents by an "iron curtain of secrecy" even if they do say  unpleasant things to the occupants of the "Smolensk Square  skyscraper [Russian Foreign Ministry Building]." On this  occasion the session was dedicated to the topical theme of  "Problems of the formation of a Pan-European security system and  relations between Russia and NATO."    The posing of this problem by the Russian Foreign Ministry,  it seems, is due to the existence of different conceptual  approaches both in the East and the West to the formation of a  pan-European security system in the context of the possible  expansion of the North Atlantic Alliance. Russian international  affairs experts, like their Western counterparts, have differing  approaches to the problem of mutual relations between Russia and  NATO. Thus the Foreign Ministry, it seems, has decided to  "synchronize watches" and listen to the informed opinion of  leading representatives of Russian political science and  well-known Russian deputies engaged on foreign policy questions.    As usual the council session was addressed by A. Kozyrev, a  fact which undoubtedly lent significance to the theme under  discussion. In particular, the foreign minister advocated that  the military, military-political, and military-industrial  machines created in the period of confrontation be reformed into  instruments of stability, security, and even cooperation between  East and West. This is viewed as a real and practical path  toward ensuring that the former enemies not only see one another  as friends and allies but also arrive at the idea of the  deepening and institutionalization of cooperation with NATO,  which has been embodied in the concept "Partnership for Peace."  Today, Russia is close to signing the corresponding agreements  but, as the head of the Russian foreign policy department  hinted, that will take at least 2-3 years.    It emerges from the minister's speech that both he and his  colleagues have not lost faith in the qualitative strengthening  of the CSCE during the new all-European summit in December this  year. But that will require resolute actions in the security  sphere within the framework of NATO, the EU, the Western  European Union, and the CIS. Such an approach is most unlike  Russia's diktat or veto toward the states of central and Eastern  Europe and NATO.    It is also symptomatic that the head of Russian diplomacy  could not ignore the "Zhirinovskiy factor." He uncompromisingly  rejected the attempts by certain circles in the West and in  central and Eastern Europe to exploit that factor and also the  intentions to attribute an enemy image to Russia because the  artificially created thesis of the Russian threat prevents  people from seeing the real security problems.    It was stressed in particular that "Partnership for Peace"  is  not the finished article but merely a pattern for  military-political cooperation. Victory in the Cold War, the  minister stated, went not to NATO's military machine but to the  democratic principles of the CSCE. This assessment of the  CSCE's role deserves the utmost attention although different  opinions exist in certain circles in the West, as is well known.  Clearly, the different approaches should not lead to the  division of Europe into opposing alliances and spheres of  influence.    This speech was marked by its straightforwardness. A.  Kozyrev did not resort to trickery and honestly set out the  Russian position on the formation of a security system in  Europe. But Moscow's efforts alone will clearly not be enough.  There must be a cooperative approach from other states and the  world community. A. Kozyrev's frank discussion with W.  Christopher, his U.S. counterpart, in Vladivostok will make it  clear whether such an approach is forthcoming.    Predictably enough, the minister's speech provoked a keen  debate, which revealed quite a wide spread of opinions, ranging  from agreement to accept the invitation to share NATO's  "Partnership for Peace" concept and work with NATO on parallel  courses, on the one hand, to pessimistic predictions on the idea  of deepening cooperation with NATO on the other. But even the  supporters of the first approach, and they formed the majority,  had to acknowledge that although the North Atlantic bloc remains  an important factor in the preservation of military-political  stability in Europe it is nevertheless a rudiment of the Cold  War and thus needs to be transformed itself.    One path for the alliance's evolution is to merge into the  pan-European security structure, first and foremost under the  auspices of the CSCE and the United Nations. But even here the  viewpoints differed. Some political scientists did not rate  highly the potential of the CSCE as a universal pan-European  forum. The UN's rating was higher. There were also appeals to  revive the UN military staff committee for the leadership of  international peacemaking operations.    On the whole there were quite a few well argued appeals to  the effect that broader account should be taken of the opinion  of the people's masses when carrying out various foreign policy  actions. For example, a warning was expressed that the  unification of the central and East European countries and NATO  will upset the existing balance of security and lead to a growth  in nationalist feelings within Russian society. The reasons:  The old stereotyped perceptions of the West and NATO are still  strong in Russia.    It was also noted that Russia must reinforce its image as a  democratic state which enjoys the reputation of being a reliable  partner and must destroy the anti-Russian psychological complex  which is entrenched in Eastern Europe by means of establishing  relations of a new type based on trust and good-neighborliness.    A special place in the discussion was occupied by questions  of defining the optimum forms of combining national priorities  and collective principles in the formation of the pan-European  security system which takes into account Russia's specific  interests in European affairs. It was pointed out that  cooperation between Russia and NATO must be carried out on a  mutually beneficial and equitable basis and the Russian  "Partnership" program must correspond as much as possible to the  vital interests of our national security. It was proposed that  contacts with NATO be strengthened by the signing of agreements  on various aspects of international security, as happened in the  days of the former USSR, and by building up bilateral  cooperation with leading Western states.    Considerable attention was paid to the problems of involving  our CIS partners in the efforts aimed at forming a European  security system and to the effect that Russia's involvement in  the "Partnership" program would have on centripetal processes  within the Commonwealth itself. The idea was expressed that by  joining NATO Russia will not lose its leading role in the CIS.  Thus, prior to unification there should be a preliminary  consultation with the CIS members. It was also said that Russia  must take a more active part in resolving CIS problems, which  would strengthen its role as guarantor on the territory of the  CIS. But for that, as one speaker figuratively put it, it is  necessary "not to bark but to bite." In other words, less talk,  more action.    Individual political scientists put forward highly  disturbing  predictions about the future character of the development of our  relations with China and other eastern neighbors after Russia  affiliates to the "Partnership" concept.    It was also said that people should "come back down to  earth"  and see that the development of events in Europe is being formed  under the influence of geopolitical interests which do not  presuppose Russia's smooth entry into Europe. Moreover, there  is a clear tendency toward "forcing" Russian out of the European  area. NATO's expansion by means of the countries of central and  Eastern Europe will inevitably lead to the isolation and  weakening of Russia.    There were proposals on measures to curb the process of the  admission of the central and Eastern European countries into  NATO. For that, it was said, Russia should constantly remind  people of its desire to become a full-fledged member of NATO.  But since that is hardly likely to happen the Eastward  expansion of the alliance will automatically stop.    Some of the political scientists tended to the view that  Russia's affiliation to the "Partnership for Peace" concept must  be carried out circumspectly because this could harm the Russian  military-industrial complex and lead to the loss of arms sales  markets. They spoke skeptically about Russia's participation in  the transformation of the North Atlantic alliance because "we  are the guests there, not the hosts." On the whole the Foreign  Policy Council session confirmed the importance of a joint and  constructive exchange of opinions among diplomats, scientists,  parliamentarians, and other representatives of political and  public circles on the most topical problems of Russian foreign  policy. It may be said without exaggeration that the discussion  was extraordinarily useful and was directly conducive to  achieving a democratic consensus on approaches to current  international problems.</p>

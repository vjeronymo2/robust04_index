			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Brighter tone at Argos SUGGESTIONS from Argos, the catalogue showroom retailer, that the recession may be over the worst and sales are beginning to show signs of recovery added gloss to interim results at the top end of market expectations. The shares advanced 15 to 219p in healthy volume of 1.6m. However, the company's warning that second-half trading will continue to be tough was not lost on market analysts and most kept their full-year forecasts unchanged at between Pounds 60m to Pounds 65m. Mr Andy Hughes at Nomura, keeping the shares on hold, commented: 'While Argos may have passed its low point in terms of sales, it will not be returning to the sales growth levels of recent years because volumes are so low.' County NatWest's Mr John Richards rates the shares a short-term buy, mainly because, in his opinion, the worst appears to be over. 'The group has battened down the hatches and got its costs under control. Although trading will continue tough, we think the shares should hold up and outperform the market.' Siebe squeeze Engineering group Siebe was one of the best performing FT-SE stocks yesterday as the shares jumped 27 to 631p. However, turnover of 658,000 shares was thin, indicating that the renewed confidence which has sent the market higher has failed to prise institutions away from the sidelines. Yesterday's rise was attributed mainly to demand from UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, which led to a squeeze. Yet, only last week the shares fell because the same house was said to have had a large seller. Sentiment was also boosted by a recommendation from Merrill Lynch. The US securities house has moved the stock from a hold to a buy. Explaining the move, Merrill analyst Mrs Jenny Tora said: 'The recent falls have been overdone, but in addition, we favour the stock because of its early cycle exposure to the appliance and automobile sector in the US which is showing hesitant signs of recovery.' Health products and services group London International moved ahead 10 to 199p, helped by a recommendation from SG Warburg. The house advised clients to buy the stock on a view that it was oversold and the market has become too pessimistic on prospects for its photo-processing operations. Pharmaceutical issues benefited from the strength on Wall Street. Glaxo, which has full-year results due on September 10, picked up 12 to 724p as US selling subsided and buying in London continued. Environmental services group Rentokil rose 7 to 154p ahead of Thursday's interim results, which are expected to show a near 20 per cent rise. Analysts forecast profits of Pounds 49.5m to Pounds 51m for the group versus a previous Pounds 42.3m. Cost-cutting, small acquisitions and some margin growth will offset adverse currency movements in driving profits higher. After registering some of the biggest falls at the end of last week, the building materials sector was the subject of bargain hunting yesterday, but turnover was thin. RMC rallied 24 to 484p, Redland 15 to 424p and Rugby 12 to 193p. Among construction issues, Berkeley Group gained 6 to 210p and Persimmon 12 to 202p. British Gas saw good two-way business on a dull day and closed a halfpenny firmer at 241 1/2 p with 11m traded. Insurance broker Sedgwick slipped a further 3 to 144p on worries that it might cut its dividend payout when it announces first-half profits today. The fears arose from a Sunday newspaper article which said Sedgwick may reduce its dividend by as much as half to 2p a share in the face of serious trading problems, particularly in the US. Analysts expect the group to post profits of between Pounds 54m and Pounds 63m, against Pounds 65.3m in the first half of 1991. Midland Bank owner HSBC fell 7 1/2 to 327 1/2 p, reflecting weakness in the Hong Kong market. Tobacco and insurance conglomerate BAT Industries climbed 23 to 746p, responding to the better results than expected disclosed last week by leading insurance groups. Results from General Accident and Commercial Union highlighted prospects for Eagle Star, BAT's insurance subsidiary, said analysts. A rash of buy recommendations following third-quarter results on Friday failed to lift Hanson and the shares closed 2 lower at 193 1/2 p. Selling in New York was said to be keeping them under pressure. Most analysts are looking for full-year profits of between Pounds 1bn and Pounds 1.05bn and argue that the shares are cheap. Nevertheless, the stock is virtually unchanged against the FT-Actuaries All-Share Index over the past year and some 12 per cent higher than just after the crash of October 1987. Last week's falls in Guinness were deemed to be overdone at the start of trading yesterday and the shares bounced 16 to 523p. Grand Metropolitan, which had benefited from switching out of Guinness, lost 5 to 420p. Downgrading in the food manufacturing sector - a constant feature in recent weeks as analysts have responded to poor trading reports - continued yesterday. Hoare Govett cut its profits estimate for United Biscuits by Pounds 10m to Pounds 185m for this year, and by Pounds 12m to Pounds 200m for 1993. The shares eased 2 to 292p. Rumours of downgrades in Unigate and Cadbury Schweppes could not be confirmed, but did undermine the shares. Unigate lost 8 to 275p, while the latter shed 4 to 437p. In stores, the Argos results proved a tonic for Kingfisher, and combined with a squeeze the shares were lifted 14 to 453p. Adverse comment in the weekend press on Thorn EMI undermined the shares, which declined 11 to 693p. Rank Organisation was also dragged lower, dipping 4 to 538p on paltry volume. Hints that price discounting on holiday packages may not be as bad as feared pushed Airtours forward 11 to 227p. Rival Owners Abroad edged up a penny to 68p. The announcement of a new finance director at Lucas Industries was greeted nervously and the shares eased a penny to 99p. Publication of the annual UK engineering directory from Albert E. Sharp, the Midlands-based broker close to the sector, boosted several stocks. These included IMI, 9 higher at 237p, and Vickers, which firmed 3 to 123p. Gains following Saatchi &amp; Saatchi's positive results last week began to appear overdone and the shares lost 6 to 152p. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992 NEW HIGHS (6).

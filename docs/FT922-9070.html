			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / Briefcase, Q &amp; A: A loan to daughter but not her boyfriend YOU recently mentioned the advisability of some form of agreement where one member of a family makes a loan to another. I am faced with a similar problem, but with a variation. My daughter has asked for assistance in finding a substantial deposit to buy a house. The mortgage will be in her name as the owner, and she will be responsible for repayments. She intends to take in her current boyfriend as a paying guest. I have read that if the relationship splits up, her friend could make a claim for a share of the property. Under these circumstances, would it be better for me to take part ownership in the property in order to protect my investment? She is of the opinion that in order to protect her ownership of the property all she has to do is to get her boyfriend to sign a document to the effect that he is only a tenant and has no claim on the property. To this end, would it be adviseable for her to issue the boyfriend with a rent book? What your daughter proposes will not be effective unless she enters into a proper lease, eg a shorthold tenancy, with her boyfriend. It is important to ensure that the lease is in a form which will not give the tenant security of tenure. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

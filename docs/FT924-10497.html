			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei average declines in index-linked trading TOKYO shares eased in index-linked trading, pushing the Nikkei average below the 17,000 support level, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue index lost 130.70 to 16,937.71 at the close, having opened at the day's high of 17,069.21 before breaking below 17,000 by mid-morning. The index fell to the day's low of 16,927.38 in the afternoon on index-linked selling. Volume fell to 160m shares from 209m, as investors remained sidelined amid interim earnings announcements. Losers led gainers by 648 to 275 with 163 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 5.26 to 1,287.13 and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 0.32 to 1033.20. Apart from a few individual theme stocks, share price movements were dominated by small-lot, index-linked trading. While some traders hope that lower interest rates will encourage institutional investors to shift funds from bonds and money markets into the equity market, most investors regard current share prices as too high. One fund manager said that the Nikkei average, trading at a price-earnings ratio of 46.8, would have to fall further before he could start buying. Dealers dabbled in speculative theme stocks. Aisin Seiki, the most active issue of the day, gained Y40 to Y1,190 on the nuclear fusion theme. Mitsubishi Materials gained Y13 to Y440 and Nippon Mining advanced Y16 to Y488. Both companies are producers of palladium, necessary for room-temperature nuclear fusion experiments. Ito-Yokado, the leading supermarket chain, rose Y40 to Y3,680 on bargain hunting after the company's president announced his resignation. The company had been hit by a wave of selling after its officials were arrested last week for alleged gangster links. Ms Setsu Yamazaki, retail analyst at James Capel, said that the resignation news had prevented further damage to Ito-Yokado's image. High-technology issues were lower on foreign selling. NEC lost Y14 to Y670 and Fujitsu fell Y4 to Y560. Traders said that some foreign investors were shuffling their portfolios, liquidating electronics issues with weak earnings forecasts. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 129.44 to 18,641.99 in volume of 14.5m shares. Roundup KUALA LUMPUR, which closed at an all-time high yesterday, and Seoul were the strongest gainers in the region. HONG KONG closed slightly weaker after a day of moderate fluctuations, but the market largely shrugged off the latest Sino-British dispute over the colony's future. The Hang Seng index closed down 9.48 at 6,117.50 as turnover fell to HKDollars 2.1bn from HKDollars 2.5bn. Bank of East Asia, suspended yesterday after a HKDollars 1.9bn placement to foreign institutions, resumed trading and closed down HKDollars 1.50 at HKDollars 36.0, the same as the placement price. KUALA LUMPUR surged in the afternoon, with strong gains in major stocks pushing the composite index up 3.82 to 637.13. Brokers said that sentiment had been encouraged in anticipation of a positive budget statement today. SEOUL advanced for the fourth consecutive session, on news that Daewoo Group chairman Kim Woo-choong would not stand for president. The composite index added 20.44 to 605.78. All Daewoo shares, which hit their lower limits in the morning session, reversed to close limit-up. Both Daewoo Corp and Daewoo Heavy Industries gained Won400 to Won9,100 and Won9,400. TAIWAN reversed early gains to close lower on profit-taking. The weighted index, which was more than 30 points higher in early trade, ended 30 down at 3,640.90 on turnover of TDollars 10.4bn after TDollars 7.8bn. A vote by the finance committee of parliament late on Wednesday to cut the stock transaction tax encouraged some early buying. But brokers do not expect the motion to pass the full parliament because it is opposed by the finance ministry and ruling Nationalist Party. BANGKOK broke above 920 with strong gains in large-capitalisation issues. The SET index rose 13.47 to 931.36 in turnover of Bt15.12bn. Thai Farmers Bank rose Bt44 to Bt688 and Siam Commercial Bank gained Bt24 to Bt996. MANILA rallied with interest in Meralco and Philippine National Bank. The composite index gained 25.46 to 1,357.01 with Meralco B shares up 7.50 pesos at 262.50 pesos and PNB rising 8 pesos to 246 pesos. NEW ZEALAND fell as Fletcher Challenge dropped 10 cents to NZDollars 1.63. The NZSE-40 lost 11.45 to 1,369.34.</p>

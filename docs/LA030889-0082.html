			<p><P> March 8, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE : BANKING/FINANCE;  </P> <P> ERNST &amp; WHINNEY ACCOUNTING FIRM SEEKS CLIENTS AMONG CALIFORNIA BANKS  </P> <P> Ernst &amp; Whinney, one of the nation's Big 8 accounting firms, is casting for  clients among West Coast banks.  </P> <P> A few of the firm's partners were hobnobbing with California bankers at the  Independent Bankers Assn. of America national convention in Anaheim last week.  The firm bought dinner for the California delegation at the pricey White House  Restaurant in Anaheim.  </P> <P> "We're looking to expand our banking practice in California," said Jerry A.  Felts, an accounting partner who recently moved to Los Angeles from Houston.  </P> <P> Ernst &amp; Whinney has only two banking clients in California, but they're two  of the biggest -- Bank of America and First Interstate Bank.  </P> <P> Felts, who is in charge of the First Interstate account, said a number of  partners and associates with experience in auditing banks and savings and loans  have moved into Ernst &amp; Whinney offices in Northern and Southern California  in recent months.  </P> <P> "Right now, we're coming out of the audit season and moving into the marketing  season, a time when people start thinking of changing accounting firms," he  said. "For the first time, we're going to put on a full-court press to see if  we can unearth some prospects."  </P> <P> The firm's marketing plan isn't complete yet, he said, but community banks and  healthy S&amp;Ls will be the primary targets. Ernst &amp; Whinney has about 50  partners and associates working in Orange County, mainly on real estate  accounts.  </P></p>

			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / Letter: Government failing to convince on CrossRail Sir, To achieve its target of attracting 30 per cent of the funding needed for CrossRail from the private sector ('Private cash sought for 30 per cent of CrossRail', July 8), the government has got to give private investors the confidence they need to commit the very large sums of funding required. The government is failing to do this at present. The case for CrossRail is unassailable. Probably the best conceived transport project to be undertaken in such a complex city setting, it will reduce congestion, bring environmental benefits and help to guarantee London's position as the world's leading international business centre. The government is right to look for input from the private sector. Governments worldwide are finding that they do not have the funds required to finance all the public services and infrastructure they would like to provide. CrossRail is a prime example of a project that would benefit from the commitment, management and market experience that the private sector can bring. If it is to win private sector backing, however, the government must now give an unequivocal commitment that the project will go ahead as soon as the legislation is enacted. It must also set out clear guidance on the level of funding and the sharing of risk. CrossRail will be a significant test of the feasibility of public/private sector partnership. The government must show full commitment in pushing it forward if it is to pave the way for private investment in other infrastructure projects needed for the 21st century.

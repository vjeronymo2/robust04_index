			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / Survey of Egypt (3): Disciplines in a crowded marketplace - A tighter credit regime is exposing several banks' inherent weaknesses EGYPT'S bankers have experienced a tough year with the government tightening credit restrictions and introducing new IMF-inspired prudential requirements that are tending to expose the inherent weakness of a number of banks. The successful introduction of a treasury bill auction system last January has squeezed liquidity in the market. Life has been made more difficult for banks with small deposit bases and thus over-dependent on what has proved an extremely tight interbank market. The latter part of 1992 has been marked by debate about a new law, aimed at strengthening Central Bank control over the financial sector which has long required more sophisticated monitoring. Influential figures in Egypt's financial circles have criticised sharply provisions in the proposed new law that would give the Central Bank the power to order the liquidation or merger of banks under its jurisdiction. Other provisions that would effectively invest the Central Bank with veto power over board members and managers of banks have also been attacked by those who claim that such measures run counter to the spirit of liberalisation that the government claims to have embraced. Representatives of some 18 foreign currency branch banks - those that are empowered to deal only in foreign currency - were especially disappointed that the new banking law did not contain provisions that would allow them to trade in local currency. These banks, most of which were established in the 1970s, have been agitating for years for their charters to be broadened, but in spite of repeated undertakings to look favourably on their requests, the government seems reluctant to redefine the role of institutions in an already crowded marketplace. Foreign branches, which had sought to develop a niche for themselves by pioneering debt swaps, have been frustrated in recent months by delays in official approvals. Officials say they have been seeking to ensure that new business does not contradict the spirit of the May, 1991 Paris club agreement under which a substantial portion of Egypt's official debt was rescheduled on extremely favourable terms. Egypt's banking system, which includes about 38 commercial banks, is dominated by the 'big four' public sector banks - National Bank of Egypt (NBE), Banque Misr, Banque du Caire and Bank of Alexandria. With their vast branch networks these dwarf the rest of the banking sector, accounting for more than two thirds of total bank deposits. After many years of prevarication, the government has at last acted to strengthen the balance sheets of these state-controlled banking giants to bring their operations into line with Bank of International Settlements criteria. Not least of steps adopted is the injection of new capital into each of the 'big four' with increases of LE1bn apiece for NBE and Banque Misr, and LE750 million for Banque du Caire and Bank of Alexandria. All banks in Egypt, and most particularly the four 'core' institutions, are also being obliged to meet BIS criteria for doubtful and non-performing loans. Previously, extremely lax definitions applied. At this stage there is no talk of privatising the financial sector, but in time, assuming that Egypt's stuttering liberalisation process proceeds, there is an increasing likelihood of calls for divestiture of state-controlled financial institutions. Government efforts, under IMF pressure, to bring capital adequacy requirements into line with international standards plus the enforcement of much tougher provisioning requirements will make these debt-laden institutions more appealing to investors. Most active in new private sector business are the bigger joint venture banks led by Misr International Bank (MIBank) in which First National Bank of Chicago has an interest. Other market leaders include Egyptian American Bank, 49 per cent owned by American Express, and the NBE-owned Commercial International Bank. For much of the year, the banking sector has been overshadowed by the Bank of Commerce and Credit International scandal which has had a direct fallout in Cairo where the joint venture BCCMisr (BCCI's stake in BCCM is 49 per cent) had placed 80 per cent or Dollars 466m of its hard currency deposits with its parent. The authorities appointed an administrator in an effort to salvage something from the wreckage. Hopes of recouping lost funds depend partly on the importance Abu Dhabi's ruling family - the owners of BCCI  - attach to fraternal relations with Egypt. President Mubarak has, more than once, appealed to Abu Dhabi's Sheikh Zayed to make good the losses. Among local banks, the Saudi-owned Faisal Islamic Bank was also particularly hard-hit by the BCCI disaster. Faisal Islamic lost millions in the 1980s due to failed BCCI-managed operations in the Cayman Islands. Faisal Islamic managers insist losses were much less than the Dollars 360m reported. IMF officials monitoring Egypt's introduction of financial sector reforms say they are well-satisfied with developments. They are especially pleased with the operations of the treasury-bill auction system. By the end of the year there was some LE7bn of stock outstanding with interest rates around 20 per cent. The new system is credited with achieving its aim of soaking up liquidity, and together with the introduction of tight credit ceilings had helped somewhat to counter inflation. Businessmen have complained long and loud about the IMF-inspired credit squeeze, but the tight money policy appears to be achieving one of the IMF's principal aims: encouraging local investors to repatriate funds lodged abroad. While evidence at this stage is largely anecdotal there are positive indications that capital flight is at last being reversed. Central Bank figures indicate one other promising trend: the beginning of a process of a 'de-dollarisation' in response to the liberalisation of interest rates. The latest CBE report noted that in 1990-91, savings in local currency increased by 20.7 per cent compared with 19.8 per cent the previous year. Growth in deposits in foreign currency was down to 9.5 per cent against 16 per cent in 1989-90. Perhaps the most striking reform of the past year has been the floating of the Egyptian pound well ahead of the February, 1992 deadline agreed with the IMF. Surprisingly, and certainly not altogether to the IMF's liking, the pound has remained remarkably stable in the past year, trading at around LE3.30 to the dollar. This is attributable to Egypt's much improved reserve position, to the liberalisation of interest rates and to the government's tight money policy. The IMF and World Bank had been calculating that the pound would drift lower against foreign currencies, thus improving Egyptian competitiveness. The new year may produced greater fluctuations as the new exchange system settles down. The introduction of official money changers may also enliven things. The banks themselves will be looking to a further easing of credit restrictions.</p>

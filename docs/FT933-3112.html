			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / International Company News: VW agrees rescue package for Seat SEAT, the Spanish subsidiary of the Volkswagen group, warned yesterday that it expected to suffer a loss of around Pta100bn (Dollars 784m) this year. The announcement followed a crisis meeting of the Seat board, which agreed a Pta120bn (Dollars 941m) financial rescue package. The meeting was called to discuss the company's deteriorating financial position, which is likely to be a significant factor in ensuring that the Volkswagen group will report a loss for the full year. Mr Ferdinand Piech, the embattled chairman of the VW management board, had insisted earlier this year that the group would succeed in breaking even for the full year, despite suffering a DM1.6bn loss in the first six months. The VW supervisory board was forced to admit earlier this month, however, that the group's financial performance was being burdened by worsening problems at Seat as well as in North America and in the Asia-Pacific region. It forecast a profit for the full year only for the VW parent company. Volkswagen agreed a financial rescue package for Seat yesterday centred on its takeover of some of the main assets of the Spanish subsidiary. In deals worth around Pta120bn (Dollars 941m), Volkswagen is taking over directly Seat's plant at Pamplona in northern Spain, which manufactures the VW Polo small car range, as well as Seat's Spanish finance company, Fiseat. At the same time Seat management has been ordered to draw up an emergency plan for returning the company to profit 'by all necessary measures, including cuts in the workforce'. Seat said its financial performance had been hit by a series of factors, including the sharp devaluation of the peseta, a heavy debt burden and a steep decline in new car sales.</p>

			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / Observer: Pressing affairs Besides thoughts of 'there but for the grace of God . . .', the Paddy Ashdown affair raises questions about the governance of Britain's newspapers. After all, we've been on probation since the replacement of the old Press Council by the Press Complaints Commission as the final trial of self-regulation in the industry. Set up a year ago, it was recommended by a committee led by Takeover Panel chief Sir David Calcutt which stipulated that if the press did not put its own house in order soon, it should be statutorily compelled to. The trouble is that the committee had in mind statutory measures covering privacy and the right to reply - notions hard to define, at least in ways compatible with public freedom of speech. In the industry itself, the general view is that since the commission was set up the tabloids have mended their ways. In particular they have tended, at any rate until very recently, to lay off the Royals (though some have it that orders handed down to the younger generations to behave themselves in public have simply resulted in fewer splashable stories). While electioneering politicians may be a more tempting target - as Ashdown's example suggests - newspapers still need to think carefully.</p>

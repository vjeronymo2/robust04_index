			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Arts: London Sinfonietta tours its musical high spots - Concerts on the South Bank In this 25th anniversary season, the London Sinfonietta is making a special point of re-visiting some of the 100-or-more works commissioned during its years of existence. The current series is, indeed, a succession of carefully timed self-back-pats - an entirely forgivable practice, after all, on the part of a musical ensemble whose record in stimulating lively, enjoyable new music has been so matchlessly crowded with success. In the case of Tuesday's Queen Elizabeth Hall concert, conducted by Diego Masson, it also resulted in a programme full of bounty. The act of reviving past commissions from Simon Bainbridge (the limpid, witty 1983 Concertante in moto perpetuo), Jonathan Lloyd (the zany yet richly substantial 1981 Waiting for Gozo), Mark-Anthony Turnage (the punchy, sweet-sour 1985 On All Fours), Boulez (the luminous 1984 Derive 1) and Xenakis (the highly coloured and exotic 1984 Thallein) amounted to more than just a tour of Sinfonietta high-spots. It afforded an apt and refreshing reminder that the British modern-music scene of the 1980s was neither monolithic, exclusive, nor riven with doctrinal hostilities, and that it was capable of elating variety. But the encouragement of the new is not being neglected: the anniversary series is dotted with premieres. On Tuesday it was Colin Matthews's Contraflow for 14 players, 12 tightly packed minutes in this composer's exhilarating new vein of hard-edged discourse. The title Matthews used for his BBC commission earlier this year, Broken Symmetry, could sensibly have been used again to suggest the rhythmically pugnacious patterns set up, the cross-currents of 'voice' and timbre. Different solo instruments emerge above the fray at different points in the unfolding to act as a form of traffic-signalling. The personality of the Sinfonietta - both in its individual talents and their corporate combination  -seems to have directly impinged on the bracing yet engaging character of the argument, not to mention the beautifully achieved climactic slowing toward reconciliation and repose.

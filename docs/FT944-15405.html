			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / Murdoch hopes BSkyB float will net Dollars 1bn for News Corp Mr Rupert Murdoch, chairman of News Corporation, said yesterday he hoped that the flotation of British Sky Broadcasting could lead to an early cash injection of Dollars 1bn (Pounds 625m) into News Corp. The remark at the company's annual meeting in Adelaide suggested that Mr Murdoch thinks the flotation could value the satellite broadcaster at Dollars 10bn or Pounds 6.25bn - the highest figure so far suggested publicly. Most analysts expected the sell-off to value the company at Pounds 4bn-Pounds 5bn. News Corp at present owns 50 per cent of BSkyB. In remarks made from notes rather than a prepared text, Mr Murdoch said: 'If one is to believe the expectations of the analysts and the valuations that have been put on the proposed reduction from 50 per cent to 40 per cent of our shareholding, it will see a strengthening (that is contingent on a lot of issues and if forecasts are correct) of the News Corporation balance sheet by the injection of another USDollars 1bn in cash.' A pathfinder document preparing the way for the flotation is expected next month, with mid-December the likely date for the flotation of BSkyB, in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a 17.5 per cent stake. Mr Murdoch said he very much hoped, markets permitting, that the sale could take place within the next few weeks or by January 1995 at the latest. Analysts believe that if a December deadline is missed the next realistic date would be March. The News Corp chairman conceded that most of his established businesses, although extremely active, had not increased profits in the past 12 months. The big growth had come from investments in two partnership companies - BSkyB, which recorded a 170 per cent rise in operating profits in the year to the end of June, and Ansett airlines of Australia. Together, the two associated companies contributed a combined ADollars 394m to boost News Corp's 1993-94 net profit to ADollars 1.2bn (Pounds 550m). Mr Murdoch also spelled out how he sees the development of the organisation  -vertical integration 'from top to bottom ' in the media business. He added that the company intended 'to expand and double and then redouble our production of electronically filmed entertainment'. As part of the plan, the company was establishing a ADollars 20m film production centre in Sydney which would produce at least three international feature movies a year. Shareholders were also given new details about News International's newspaper price-cutting wars in the UK. Mr Murdoch, who admitted that at one stage selling The Sun at 20p had cost the company Pounds 1m a week, said the price of the paper, now 22p, would gradually rise. 'We expect to hold the majority of our (circulation) gain as we go back up in price slowly,' he said. With The Times still selling at 20p, Mr Murdoch promised: 'We will keep that pressure on there and keep going.' He also said he was in no hurry to issue new limited-voting preference shares in News Corp and had no plans for big acquisitions at the moment. TVB wins go-ahead for satellite service, Page 31</p>

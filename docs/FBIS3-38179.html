They added that an economic crisis might occur in the coming  years as a result of monetary and fiscal imbalances. "Things  have turned sour. I am afraid difficult times are ahead of us,"  one senior government economist told a TURKISH DAILY NEWS editor.    The same official, one of Prime Minister Tansu Ciller's  closest economic aides, said that economic conditions have  deteriorated so rapidly that the political authorities might  soon be deadlocked. He spoke on condition of strict anonymity.  In a related development, one senior monetary authority  confirmed to the TURKISH DAILY NEWS that Turkey had no foreign  currency shortages at the moment. However, he warned that if the  present trend continues for another two years, the economy will  have to confront a foreign currency crisis.    "The prime minister is right when she says there is no  currency shortage in the economy. Yet the Turkish economy won't  endure today's growing foreign account deficits for another two  years," he said. He also asked not to be named.    The Turkish foreign trade gap climbed to an all-time high of  $11.3 billion in the first 10 months of 1993, compared with the  original program target of only $8.8 billion.    The current account deficit soared to $4.8 billion in the  January-October period, making the prospect for the balance of  payments a bleak one.    Prime Minister Tansu Ciller denies that Turkey has foreign  currency problems.    She claimed that the economic management of the coalition  government will start bearing fruit in 1995.</p>

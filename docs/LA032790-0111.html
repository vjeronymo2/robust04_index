			<p><P> March 27, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHANCE HELD 'SLIM' FOR L.A. CLUB FIRE  </P> <P> Calling members of the Los Angeles City Fire Department "the toughest doormen  in town," Fire Chief Donald O. Manning said Monday that the city is in no  danger of a fire disaster like the one in New York over the weekend in which 87  people died because of stiff regulations and constant inspections of all public  places.  </P> <P> "It could happen here, but the likelihood is very, very slim," Manning said.  </P> <P> "We have some very effective tools in dealing with these problems."  </P> <P> The chief added that Los Angeles apparently has fewer illegal nightclubs than  New York.  </P> <P> So far this year, the Los Angeles Fire Department has shut down 18 nightclubs  for overcrowding -- four of which were operating illegally, Manning said. The  last time a fire killed people at a local nightclub was in 1975, when five  people were killed in a blaze at the Mecca Club in South Los Angeles, Manning  said.  </P></p>

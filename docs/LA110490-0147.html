			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN MARCOS' PATH  </P> <P> San Marcos is at a crossroads, and the election Nov. 6 may well determine which  direction it will take.  </P> <P> The city can either continue on its pell-mell growth pattern, with no concern  about the pleas of residents for reasonable, lower-density development. Or it  can respect the wishes of residents by choosing the path that retains many of  the characteristics that have made San Marcos unique.  </P> <P> The only City Council member who has been dedicated to protecting residents'  rights and quality of life is Pia Harris. I have known Pia for 21 years, and  she keeps her word to voters. She cares about people and about San Marcos.  </P> <P> MIA URBACH, San Marcos  </P></p>

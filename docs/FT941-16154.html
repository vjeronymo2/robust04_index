			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / European carmakers' sales hopes collapse European carmakers yesterday downgraded their forecasts for sales growth in 1994, and called on Japanese exporters to freeze their share of the European Union market. Mr Giorgio Garuzzo, new president of the European automobile manufacturers' association (ACEA), warned that sales growth in the UK and perhaps in France, would not compensate for a continued decline in the rest of the EU. He said sales across the EU would grow by between 1 and 2 per cent. In October, ACEA forecast 2.9 per cent growth for 1994. The 1991 EU-Japan agreement on Japanese exports of cars and light vehicles foresees a gradual opening of the EU market, with the abolition of national quotas by the end of the decade. When the EU market is growing, Japan is allowed to increase its market share. But Mr Garuzzo, who is chief operating officer of Fiat of Italy, said yesterday that the Japanese had already pushed up their slice of the market from 11.3 per cent in 1992 to around 12 per cent in 1993, while new car passenger registrations in the EU fell 15.3 per cent. 'We believe that the spirit of the agreement would require ..a temporary freeze of (Japanese) market share, (while) such an ice-age continues in Europe,' Mr Garuzzo told a press conference at the opening of the Brussels motor show. Last year, the European Commission underestimated the downturn in the EU market, and had to press for revision of the original Japanese export target. The Japanese authorities eventually agreed in September to limit vehicles entering the EU to 980,000 units, down 17.6 per cent on 1992. Commission and Japanese officials will meet next month for their first serious discussion of 1994 forecasts. ACEA took the opportunity to launch a paper on industrial restructuring of the motor industry, which calls on the Commission and national governments to support the manufacturers as they adapt to greater Japanese competition. For example, ACEA is calling for particular efforts to complete the single market - by harmonising tax systems which distort car prices - focus certain research programmes on industrial technologies to help the industry, and support training and retraining of car workers. However, Mr Garuzzo said the European industry was quietly adapting to competition, and there was 'no reason to think that we shall be weaker than the Japanese in the next century.'</p>

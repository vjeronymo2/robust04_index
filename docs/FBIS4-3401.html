			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by (Feng Qi) and (Zhang Xiaochun); from the </F> "Provincial Hookup" program]    [Text] On 17 April the Ministry of Public Security sent a  congratulatory message to the Anhui Provincial Public Security  Department, extending congratulations and solicitude to our  public security cadres and policemen who assisted Zhejiang  Province in cracking the exceptionally serious case of robbery,  arson, and killing aboard the tour boat Hairui on Qiandao Lake;  and expressing the hope our public security organs would  continue to cooperate with their Zhejiang counterparts in  carrying out follow-up work.

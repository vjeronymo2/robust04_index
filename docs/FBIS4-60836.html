			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Olga Semenova] </F>   [Text] Moscow 29 April TASS -- The Russian Foreign  Intelligence Service believes that a life sentence which ex-CIA  officer Aldrich Ames got for spying for the USSR and Russia is a  very severe punishment.    "No matter for who Ames worked, we believe the punishment to  be too harsh," Tatyana Samolis, spokeswoman of the director of  the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service, told TASS on Friday.    "I believe that after the end of the `Cold War' and with the  general warming of the world political climate, as well as from  purely humane considerations, he should not have been sentenced  for life," Samolis said.    She added that most of her colleagues regard the ballyhoo  around the so-called "major spy case in the history of the  United States" as hypocrisy.    Addressing Russian intelligence officers on Wednesday,  President Boris Yeltsin said that the "true reasons of this  anti-Russian (Ames) affair have a purely political tint" and  added that the United States is "mounting efforts to recruit  spies in Russia."</p>

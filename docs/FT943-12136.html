			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / Washington tries to salvage crime bill The White House and Congress are working feverishly to salvage the crime bill, which is stalled amid bitter disputes over race, the death penalty and a proposed ban on assault weapons. The proposed, multi-faceted law passed the Senate and House in varying forms last spring but has been held up for weeks in a joint House-Senate conference committee. After a week's postponement, the committee was due to meet yesterday for what could be final negotiations. If the committee does not this week release a bill which both chambers of Congress can pass, it is unlikely to be enacted this year, dealing a big blow to the Clinton administration. President Bill Clinton met leaders of the influential congressional Black Caucus yesterday to try to work out a compromise on a provision in the House version that would allow defendants to use statistics to challenge the death penalty as racially biased. Backers of the provision say the death penalty is applied disproportionately to black people. The Senate version of the bill does not contain this provision, and Senate Republicans have threatened a filibuster to kill any crime bill that includes 'racial justice' provisions. The White House initially favoured the so-called Racial Justice Act but has since retreated in the face of fierce Senate opposition, outraging the Black Caucus, whose votes may be essential to passing the crime bill in the House.</p>

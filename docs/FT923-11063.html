			<p>920727 FT  27 JUL 92 / Bush in quandary over Baghdad THE past week's confrontation between Iraq and the United Nations placed the US administration in a quandary: if President Saddam Hussein did not learn his lesson in the destruction wrought on his army and his nation by Operation Desert Storm, what kind of action would be likely now to force him to comply with the ceasefire terms he grudgingly accepted a year and half ago? Yesterday's apparent climbdown by Iraq averted any immediate need for military action, but US officials feared that the stand-off at the agriculture ministry in Baghdad - where UN inspectors had been stopped from entering in pursuit of their quest for details of Iraq's programme to build nuclear and chemical weapons - was just one facet of a much broader pattern of Iraqi defiance in recent weeks. The regime has been razing rebellious Shi'ite villages in the south of the country, damming up the waterways that feed the southern marshes, bombing UN and humanitarian organisations in the north-east, and refusing to co-operate with the UN commission drawing the boundary between Iraq and Kuwait. 'What may be most disturbing is that it seems in the last several weeks there's begun to be a pattern of Iraqi rhetoric reasserting their claim to Kuwait as the 19th province of Iraq, going right back to the original cause of the conflict,' said Mr Paul Wolfowitz, defence under-secretary. Although this broader pattern makes Iraq's defiance harder to ignore, it also widened the range of threats that the US and its coalition partners could plausibly use. Possible targets for bombing raids range from surviving military factories and communications facilities to the airfields Mr Saddam is using to attack the Shi'ites. US senators have suggested targeting the national electricity grid or Mr Saddam himself. US officials believe that they will have to keep their target list close to hand, for there are few in Washington who believe that President Saddam will not try his luck again. Officials fear, moreover, that while limited military action could well force an Iraqi retreat in any particular confrontation, nothing short of the removal of Mr Saddam is likely to bring Baghdad permanently into line. Pentagon planners have warned President George Bush that they cannot guarantee President Saddam's death or removal without a ground invasion of Iraq in even greater force than that brought to bear for Desert Storm - an option that appears unlikely to be acceptable either internationally or domestically. Mr Dick Cheney, the defence secretary, said yesterday that Mr Saddam was a legitimate though incidental target as part of the Iraqi chain of command, but that the only way to ensure his capture would be 'to send a lot of American troops to downtown Baghdad.' He defended, however, last year's decision not to pursue the Desert Storm campaign all the way to the Iraqi capital. 'The question is how many additional American casualties would you have been willing to accept to get Saddam Hussein? And my answer was then and is now, not very damn many,' Mr Cheney said. With Mr Saddam still in power, Iraq remains a political albatross around President Bush's neck. Governor Bill Clinton, the Democratic presidential candidate, has affirmed his complete backing for the president in the confrontation, but misses no opportunity to remind his listeners of the Bush administration's cosy relationship with Mr Saddam right up to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. More damaging than these questions about Mr Bush's pre-war Iraqi policy, however, is the image of a president as baffled and powerless as President Jimmy Carter in the face of the Iranian hostage crisis in 1980.</p>

			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / Party exchanges passion for the new pragmatism: The choice of leader offers few surprises THERE is no longer room for the politics of revolution in the dour 1990s. The departure two years ago of the then Mrs Margaret Thatcher marked the triumph of Tory pragmatism over ideology. Labour's overwhelming endorsement this weekend of Mr John Smith gave the opposition a leader who, like Mr John Major, thrives on cautious consensus rather than charisma. The mood among the 1,000 or so delegates - MPs, trade unionists and constituency activists - who crowded London's Royal Horticultural Hall was curiously sanguine. The shock of the election was behind them. There were no recriminations. They were there to start again. The only reminder of what might have been came from remaindered copies of the glossy pre-election policy documents at the bookstall. Nor were there any surprises. Even the extraordinary 91 per cent of the vote secured by Mr Smith had been predicted in advance. Mr Kinnock, never a great friend of his successor, won warm and genuine applause on his last appearance as leader. But the quiet, sometimes timid, demeanour of the delegates as the votes were counted provided ample testimony to the party's desire to replace passion with respectability. Mrs Margaret Beckett, who secured victory in the deputy leadership contest without setting out more than the roughest outline of her personal political agenda, responded to the mood. Her acceptance speech promised a recasting of Labour's vision but said nothing of how it might be achieved. Mr Smith, looking every bit the confident Scottish barrister that Labour believes it needs to reassure the voters, went further. He will never be a platform speaker. He prefers precision to rhetorical flourishes. But he struck the chords that most of delegates wanted to hear. Labour was the party of change, so it must be ready to change itself. It had to build into its belief in the virtue of community an exposition of how the individual would profit from a fairer society. It had to strengthen its message on the need for democracy and devolution; it had to reinforce its appeal by modernising its relationship with the trade unions. Shadow cabinet colleagues welcomed the agenda as a signal that Mr Smith would press ahead with the reforms of the Kinnock years. All but the union delegates cheered when the new leader stated the obvious: the block vote at party conferences and in the choice of leader cannot survive. But anyone expecting Mr Smith to lead a rush during the next 12 months for Labour to redefine its policies and its constitution will be disappointed. If the first thread through his speech was change, the second was gradualism. Some of his colleagues share the judgment. Mr Kinnock, the argument runs, had no choice but to grab his party by the scruff of the neck if the extremists were to be shaken out and the ideological baggage dumped. Mr Smith now has time to build a consensus before reshaping the party's constitution or delivering new policy blueprints on which to fight the next election. Other shadow cabinet members view delay as fatal, providing the opportunity for the union leaders to come up with self-serving fudges that disguise the exercise of their power while preserving its reality. The balance that Mr Smith strikes between those two approaches will be crucial to the party's electoral fortunes. But for now Labour seems content to lick its wounds. A new leader is change enough.</p>

			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / International Company News: Swedish forestry group down sharply SCA, Sweden's second-largest forestry company, yesterday announced a sharp drop in profits (after financial items) for the first four months of the year, to SKr204m (Dollars 35.47m) from SKr1.10bn for the same period of 1991. Net sales dropped to SKr10.60bn from SKr11.52bn. Mr Martin Lof, chief executive, forecast profit (after financial items) for the whole of 1992 would be between SKr400m and SKr500m. This compares with a profit of SKr1.22bn for last year. SCA has been able to cushion the full impact of the recession in the pulp and paper industry through its extensive restructuring programme, designed to produce savings of SKr1bn. The company estimated that there had been savings of SKr365m in the first four months of this year. The company has a much more diversified range of products than other Swedish forestry groups. This, however, has not stopped the fierce price war in the industry and the continuing weak demand from affecting its sales of paper and pulp products. Operating profit for the packaging business fell in the first four months by 21 per cent, to SKr161m from SKr203m. It made an actual loss of SKr94m in its graphic paper division compared with a SKr106m profit last time. SCA's operating profit in forest and timber activities dropped 27 per cent, to SKr100m from SKr159m. By contrast, there was a 7 per cent improvement in its operating profit for hygiene products, to SKr252m from SKr235m, due to higher volumes and improved production efficiency. Mr Lof said SCA's recovery depended on the pace of the business revival in the US and Europe. He said there were some welcome signs of an upturn in the US packaging industry, with a particularly sharp improvement in volume in the corrugated liner sector.</p>

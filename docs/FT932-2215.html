			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family: Unit trusts win tax concession - At a Glance The unit trust industry scored a success this week after intensive lobbying. Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the treasury, committed the government to introduce legislation in the next Finance Bill to allow unit trusts to pay income gross to non-UK residents. This would allow onshore UK trusts to compete with other collective funds, based in Luxembourg and Dublin. The government also decided to remove an anomaly, relating to the change in advance corporation tax in this year's Budget, which might have led to the sale of substantial unit trust holdings by UK life companies.</p>

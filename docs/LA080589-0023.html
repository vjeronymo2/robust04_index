			<p><P> August 5, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ASTRO PITCHER GETS OFF SCOTT FREE IN EYES OF HERSHISER, DODGERS  </P> <P> Every time Mike Scott of the Houston Astros plays the Dodgers, the Dodgers give  him a bad time and it just isn't fair.  </P> <P> I heard that Orel Hershiser said Scott cheats. Hershiser has no right to malign  Scott. Scott is a nice guy, but he doesn't flaunt it like Hershiser.  </P> <P> MARY H. BURKE  </P> <P> Glendale  </P></p>

			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Signs of an end to merger wave: Brussels will this week decide on the Dollars 3bn Shell-Montedison venture On Wednesday, a meeting of European commissioners is scheduled to decide whether to allow a Dollars 3bn (Pounds 2bn) plastics joint venture to be created by Royal Dutch/Shell and Montedison, the industrial arm of Italy's troubled Feruzzi empire. To try to secure approval, the companies are prepared to offer concessions that will limit the strength of the joint venture. But if the deal is blocked, it could signal an end to the round of chemicals industry restructuring that dominated the early 1990s. Called Montell, the joint venture would plug gaps in each company's strategy. Both are strong in polypropylene, a material with annual global sales of about Dollars 10bn. Montell would have a global market share of about 19 per cent, four times its nearest competitor, and a European share of 24 per cent. Montedison's forerunner, Montecatini, pioneered the development of polypropylene in the 1950s and the company's plastics subsidiary Himont remains a world leader with a technology licensed to companies in North America and Asia. But Montedison is hampered by a debt mountain of L13,600bn (Pounds 5.6bn) - even after a L5,177bn rights issue in January - and by the high cost of buying in feedstocks. Shell has financial strength and petrochemical feedstocks. It is strong in markets such as northern Europe and Australasia, but weak in southern Europe and east Asia where Montedison is well placed. Montell would also be a strong player in the Dollars 25bn-a-year market for polyethylene, best known for plastic bags and film. Himont has developed a technique for making linear low density polyethylene, or LLDPE, which has some advantages over older methods. The proposed Shell-Himont venture is just the latest in Europe's industry-wide restructuring. The biggest moves in the past two years include Hoechst's merger of its PVC and plant protection businesses with those of Wacker-Chemie and Schering, in Germany; Snia of Italy's fibres deals with France's Rhone Poulenc and with Courtaulds of the UK; and ICI of the UK's nylon-for-acrylics swap with Du Pont of the US. Such deals have been a response not only to recession but to the rise of three groups of global competitors: Eastern European manufacturers are exporting cheap commodity chemicals to western Europe, taking advantage of low labour costs, weak currencies and lax environmental controls. The Middle East is now a source of petrochemicals and plastics with the advantage of abundant local feedstocks. East Asia has emerged as a force in chemicals as exports from Europe and the US have been displaced by local plants large enough to supply customers in Europe and North America. The strength of these competitors is reflected in the relatively slow growth of western European chemicals exports: from 1985 to 1992 exports rose 13 per cent to Ecu 48.9bn (Pounds 38bn), but imports climbed 29 per cent to Ecu 24.3bn, according to the European Chemical Industry Council. Rationalisation of the western European industry may or may not reverse this trend, but it has at least helped to rescue corporate earnings. First-quarter pre-tax profits at Germany's BASF, a big polypropylene producer, rose 46.6 per cent to DM349m (Pounds 140m). Strong performances were also revealed by Hoechst and Bayer, another German company. There was optimism too from Akzo Nobel, created by the Dutch group Akzo's takeover of Sweden's Nobel Industries. Shell acknowledges that the industry's emergence from recession may slow the restructuring drive. Companies and politicians are more amenable to cost-cutting ventures when profits are under pressure. 'It's easier to put together a deal when times are brutal than when they are not,' says one Shell executive. This week's Commission decision could confirm that time is indeed running out for industry mergers. A committee of national competition experts has recommended that the joint venture be vetoed. Shell says the main issue is control over polypropylene technology and, as a result, the past few days have seen last-minute concessions by both parties. 'There is a point at which the price of concessions makes the fundamental synergies not beneficial enough,' says Shell. But failure would be hard to swallow. 'We have invested three years in coming to this point. We faced a lot of naysayers inside and outside the organisation, arguing that it would be too complex to get done. But strategically it is a beautiful fit.' Lex, Page 24</p>

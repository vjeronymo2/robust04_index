			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / Company News (This Week): Analysts focus on state of play more than profits - ICI ICI reports its first set of full-year figures since the demerger of Zeneca last summer on Thursday. Thanks largely to cost-cutting and currency gains profits before exceptionals are expected to have doubled to between Pounds 270m and Pounds 300m. Analysts' estimates for 1993 are in a tight range and attention will focus on the company's comments about the state of its major markets. It is expected to be quite positive about the US and UK but to report that continental Europe remains very tough both in terms of volumes and prices. Even if German interest rate cuts continue few observers expect much recovery this year and a stronger pound would make ICI's life more difficult. The recent failure of European manufacturers to agree on a restructuring of ethylene production underlined the deep-rooted problems of an industry dogged by overcapacity. Analysts will be expecting an update on ICI's own restructuring programme, which has meant hefty rationalisation costs over the past three years. In 1992 the combined group reported a loss of Pounds 384m after exceptionals of Pounds 949m. There are expected to have been further provisions last year including a Pounds 100m charge associated with the proposed disposal of its American composite materials business and Pounds 30m for the closure of Electrochlor, its indirectly owned PVC manufacturer in Argentina. Analyst Ian John at NatWest Securities predicts FRS3 pre-tax profits of Pounds 107m after exceptionals. Analysts have been downgrading their forecasts for the current year and, unless ICI is more bullish than expected, most are likely to maintain their view that the shares are now discounting its medium-term recovery potential. The City is expecting unchanged dividends of 27.5p compared with underlying earnings of about 22.5p.</p>

			<p><P> August 18, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: OPERATION RESCUE TO HOLD PRAYER VIGIL AT  CLINIC  </P> <P> The anti-abortion group Operation Rescue, cheered by Catholic Archbishop Roger  Mahony's comparison of them to formerly oppressed Eastern European Christians,  announced plans Friday to protest at a Los Angeles women's clinic today.  </P> <P> To avoid risking arrest, the protesters will not block entrances at the Women's  Health Clinic on Spring Street, but will stand in prayer at an 8 a.m. vigil,  then march to City Hall, officials of the group said.  </P> <P> Organizers said they will object to what they consider unjust jail sentences  given to hundreds of protesters who attempted to block doors at clinics.  </P> <P> A national organizer for Operation Rescue said the action is a tactical  maneuver that has been used elsewhere.  </P> <P> Mahony spoke to about 200 Operation Rescue stalwarts at a conference at  Catholic-run Loyola Marymount University. He urged patience with what he called  the "ignorance" of abortion rights advocates.  </P></p>

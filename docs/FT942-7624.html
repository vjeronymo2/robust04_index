			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / EU auditing 'unintelligible' The Court of Auditors, the European Union's main financial watchdog, suffers from 'top heavy' senior management and is not professional enough in fighting fraud in the EU budget, Mr Jo Carey, a former UK Treasury official and expert on EU finances, said yesterday.

Many experts believe waste totals at least 5 per cent of EU spending, with much of the fraud due to abuse of farm subsidies. Mr Carey said the court's efforts to pinpoint fraud ranged from reports akin to 'slightly haphazard investigative journalism' to documents which were rigorously argued and 'objective and relevant to policy'.</p>

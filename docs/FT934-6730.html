			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: London stocks fall sharply with global trend Gloomy trends in world stock markets took their toll of UK equities yesterday, and although business volume was not heavy, share prices fell across a wide range. UK traders rightly sensed that London would be unable to resist the heavy fall in Tokyo and the signs of a renewed side in US Federal bonds, and prices were marked lower from the opening. A very slight attempt to rally was quickly halted when Wall Street opened the new session with a fall of 35 Dow points in London hours, and the FT-SE Index closed virtually at the day's low, a fall of 37.4 bringing a reading of 3,070.6. The negative influences from other global centres had to be digested by a stock market already inclined to take cover after UK analysts had suggested that the base rate cut so keenly expected on Budget Day, a week today, might be postponed for a while. The setback in equities in London, which saw the Footsie 3,100 mark abandoned, was emphasised by significant losses in government bonds and by a setback in bourses across Europe, with Germany hit by disappointing money supply figures. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index abruptly reversed the recovery of the past week, sliding 19.9 to 3,435.4. But traders' conviction that genuine trading volume had been relatively unexciting was borne out by a Seaq total of only 455.4m shares against 514.4m on Friday. Yesterday's trading session appeared to reflect the host of bearish factors which have been leaning on the London stock market for the past two weeks. The renewed weakness in US Federal bonds reminded UK dealers of the reasons behind the tremor suffered towards during the previous equity account. Moreover, weakness in Tokyo underlined the implications of last week's decision by a US investment bank to lighten holdings in the Japanese equity market. Near-term confidence was running low at the London close, when traders were bracing themselves for a difficult opening to trading today if the Dow Industrial Average continues to fall. Some stock was sold yesterday but most of the big institutions have largely closed down trading positions ahead of next week's Budget speech - a process hastened by Friday's problems with the Seaq electronic system. Particularly unsettling was the setback in UK government bond prices which undermined confidence in prospects for Budget rate cut as well as bringing into close focus the market's apprehension that the turn to higher rates may come sooner than expected. US-influenced stocks suffered the most in the shakeout, although dealers said that share prices had been marked down too quickly for sellers to unload stock. The problems may come later in the week, if fund managers seize opportunities to sell if the market shows signs of recovery. Bank shares were among the most hard hit, hit both by weakness in the financial sectors on Wall Street and by fear that and pressure towards higher interest rates at home will revive all the problems of bank loan books. The sector has stronmgly outperformed the market in recent weeks and traders were quick to take profits yesterday. Consumer and retail stocks ended with modest losses ahead of a week which wil bring important trading results from the sector and test confidence in the prospects for a consumer-led recovery in the domestic economy. While these sectors are closely linked to base rate hopes, investors have been cautious during the run-up to the Budget and marketmakers have avoided taking large positions.</p>

			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / GDP up 0.7% in quarter: Imports recalculation boosts growth figure for 1993 to 2% The UK's gross domestic product grew by 0.7 per cent in real terms in the first quarter of 1994, confirming earlier estimates, the Central Statistical Office reported yesterday. However, a CSO review of trade statistics, which reduced the volume (although not the value) of imports last year, has resulted in estimates of 1993's GDP growth being revised upwards from 1.9 to 2 per cent. A rise in export volumes also helped boost GDP in the first quarter of 1994. The latest GDP figures from the CSO use three methods to calculate economic growth: output, income and expenditure. The expenditure measure appears to show that growth accelerated sharply in the second half of 1993. However, that effect is smoothed out when the three calculation methods are combined. GDP in the first quarter was 2.6 per cent higher, at constant prices, than in the first quarter of 1993. If oil and gas are excluded, GDP rose 0.6 per cent in the first quarter and was 2 per cent higher than in the same period a year earlier. The opening of new oilfields in the North Sea has caused a sharp rise in UK oil production over the past year although the growth rate appears to be slowing. The GDP deflator, which measures the average prices of the components of GDP and is an indicator of inflation, rose 0.6 per cent in the first quarter of 1994 and was 3.1 per cent higher than in the first quarter of 1993. Consumer expenditure rose 0.7 per cent in the first quarter, and was 3.4 per cent higher than in the first quarter of 1993. Spending increased in most areas except energy, which was affected by the mild temperatures (pre-payment of fuel bills was not taken into account in the figures). Income from employment in the first quarter was 4 per cent higher than a year earlier, in line with Department of Employment estimates of the annual growth in average earnings. Gross domestic fixed capital formation, or fixed investment, rose 2.2 per cent on the previous quarter and was 3.4 per cent higher than in the first quarter of 1993. 'These are encouraging figures in terms of hopes of an export and investment-led recovery,' said Mr Mark Reckless, UK economist at SG Warburg Securities. However, capital expenditure by manufacturing industry was 1 per cent lower in the first quarter than in the fourth quarter of 1993. The value of stocks and work in progress fell by Pounds 244m in the first quarter, having risen by Pounds 99m in the last quarter of 1993.</p>

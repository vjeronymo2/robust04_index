			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / World Trade News: Russians win first satellite contract RUSSIA won its first commercial contract yesterday to launch a western-built satellite into orbit. The Dollars 36m (Pounds 23.2m) deal opens the way for Russia to undercut its three western rivals in the Dollars 2bn-a-year commercial launch market. It is also likely to trigger calls for steps to protect the US launch industry. Vice-President-elect Al Gore and other senior Democratic politicians have recently demanded action to stop predatory pricing of launches by Russia and China. The contract was placed by Inmarsat, a 65-nation international co-operative of nations and the world's second biggest independent operator of commercial satellites. At the same time, it awarded a Dollars 62m contract to launch a similar satellite on the Ariane rocket built by Arianespace, the French-led European consortium controlling half the market. The loser at yesterday's Inmarsat council meeting was General Dynamics of the US, which won in the previous round of Inmarsat contracts. 'This mix of launchers minimises risk,' Mr Olof Lundberg, Inmarsat director-general, said. He described the choice of the Russian Proton rocket as 'pioneering', while conceding it was 'commercially unknown'. The decision is likely to generate a strong reaction from the new administration in Washington. Last week Senator John D Rockefeller said that allowing launch business to go to Russia and China 'could jeopardise the US space launch industry.' The US might have to change its trade policy to protect US interests, he added. Russia may get its second contract within weeks. Intelsat, a co-operative of more than 120 nations and the biggest independent satellite owner, is to choose between Russia, China, Japan, Arianespace and General Dynamics for a series of launches, in December.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Nairobi, 9 May (AFP) -- Sporadic gunfire continued  in Rwanda's capital Kigali on Monday [9 May] despite two  ceasefire offers, one by government forces and the other by  rebels, a United Nations spokesman said. But the fighting has  slackened off considerably from last week, when the  corpse-littered city shook with the boom of mortar explosions as  the belligerents shelled each other mercilessly. "It's been  relatively quiet since Saturday," said spokesman Abdul Kabia  contacted by telephone in Kigali. "We don't know whether the  ceasefires are having any effect, but they have more or less  stopped fighting for a while."    One ceasefire that was to have started at midnight Saturday  was signed by Rwanda's interim government last week. The rebel  Rwanda Patriotic Front then signed another, supposed to have  taken effect at midnight Sunday. But Western diplomats and  relief officials in the region expressed doubt that either would  staunch Rwanda's month-old bloodbath in which some 100,000  people have reportedly been killed.    Diplomats said reports indicated that pro-government  militias  only loosely under the control of the government were  responsible for most of the slaughter, targeting members of the  minority Tutsi tribe that forms the backbone of the rebel  movement and Hutu opposition supporters. The militias would not  feel bound by a ceasefire, and would continue clubbing and  hacking their victims to death, the diplomats said.</p>

Speaking first, Lithuanian president A. Brazauskas specified  what he believes are the three highest priority directions for  foreign policy: closer cooperation with the Baltic nations and  the countries of Northern Europe, further integration of  Lithuania into Europe's economic, political, cultural and  security systems, as well as the improvement of relations with  neighboring countries.    Developing the idea of closer cooperation with the Baltic  countries, the president talked broadly about the problem  concerning the construction of an oil terminal. He thought it  entirely natural-- in the wake of the Latvian government  proposal to do so--that the possibilities of constructing a  terminal in Liepaja were being considered. "It is regrettable  that some perceive this as politically motivated", Brazauskas  said.    On the subject of relations with Russia, and specifically  regarding military transport to the Kaliningrad region, the  president noted that there will be consultations with foreign  experts on this issue. The president also spoke out in favor of  the demilitarization of the Kaliningrad region and of having it  become a free economic zone.    The president of Lithuania specified the signing of a free  trade agreement with the European Union as one of the most  important tasks on the road into Europe. He said that  heretofore, insufficient attention had been paid to economic  relations with western countries, because greater attention had  been paid to the normalization of relations with the East,  which, in the opinion of the president, Lithuania has basically  succeeded in achieving. According to Brazauskas, there needs to  be a greater focus on the economic aspect of foreign policy and  he encouraged the government to be more active in this area.    Continuing on the topic of Lithuania's journey into Europe,  Brazauskas expressed regret that the Lithuanian constitution  does not allow for the establishment of the position of a  minister for Western European affairs, which Brazauskas believes  would greatly facilitate Lithuania's integration into the West.  He proposed that the Seimas consider the possibility of  establishing such a ministerial position, and in the meantime  assign these duties to the deputy foreign minister.    Having pointed out that of late there has been an increase  in  Lithuania of discussions and statements regarding the necessity  of joining NATO, the president stated that "there is sufficient  desire and determination." Furthermore, according to Brazauskas,  Lithuania has more arguments for drawing closer to this  organization than do its neighbors Latvia and Estonia. He also  asserted that in the aforementioned countries, the discussions  about joining NATO are not as emotional as in Lithuania.  According to the president, a serious discussion of this issue  has not even started yet in Estonia.    Brazauskas rejected accusations regarding the secrecy of  foreign policy. "There is no secret or two-faced foreign policy,  everything is open and straightforward," the president said. In  his opinion, the current foreign policy is calm and appropriate;  perhaps what was still needed was to provide information on it  to a wider audience.    According to Brazauskas, relations with Russia are not  tense;  however, it is difficult to guess what they will be in the  future. The president maintained that as Russian policy changed,  Lithuanian policy would also be reviewed, but in either case,  the issue of compensation for damages would continue to remain  one of the most important topics of negotiation.    "We ought to be courageous, intelligent, and moderate,"  Brazauskas said in concluding his address.    Speaking next, foreign minister P. Gylys first listed many  treaties that had been signed and the dates of many visits that  had taken place. He acknowledged that "the lack of conceptual  efforts was noticeable," but went on to remark that the  government's program as well as the President's conceptual  addresses served as a substitute for a conceptual framework for  foreign policy.    The minister emphasized the geopolitical aspect of foreign  policy and maintained that Lithuania could regard itself as a  Central European country. This was the reason, in his opinion,  that Lithuania should move into Europe subject to the same  conditions that are applicable to the Visegrad countries. Gylys  believes that Lithuania is rapidly pursuing these countries and  will draw even with them in the near future.    In response to questions by Seimas members, Gylys asserted  that there is no one directly responsible for the construction  of the oil terminal, because a final decision on this issue has  not yet been made. Gylys also indicated that NATO should not be  turned into an idol before which Lithuania should be made to  kneel.    Commenting on the free trade agreements with the CIS  countries, the minister said that the treaties exist, but that  because of the situations in these countries they are not being  well implemented. Free trade is going on with the Kaliningrad  region, according to the minister, it just has to be made  official.    When asked by G. Vagnorius to answer straight out whether  Lithuania intends to join NATO, Gylys said, "We aren't going  anywhere, we are where we are, however, we are going towards  NATO."    In the discussion that took place after the intermission, V.  Pleckaitis proposed that the Seimas recommend that the President  make an official application for relations with NATO, and,  having drawn attention to the fact that Germany and Russia were  drawing closer together, he asserted that Lithuania's political  leaders sometimes participate in scenarios set up by Bonn and  Moscow.    Stating that Gylys should comprehend that the pro-Russian  policy which Gylys and J. Paleckis were implementing was a  fiasco, V. Landsbergis urged that a more persistent effort be  made to seek membership in NATO. He suggested that new elements  be brought into the treaty discussions with Poland, namely, to  talk of mutual interests, as well as of security issues relating  to the Kaliningrad region.    A. Saudargas, who spoke on behalf of the  christian-democratic  faction, maintained that recently, the government had begun to  proclaim what was, in effect, a new foreign policy. What  supported such a conclusion was that the Lithuanian leadership  had, in his opinion, "clearly and categorically forbidden  Lithuania to join NATO by itself," (such a determination was  expressed at the meeting Tuesday with diplomats accredited  abroad), and "had expressed the intention to build an oil  terminal in a neighboring country, which is in substantially  greater direct danger than Lithuania."    The statement made by LDDP representative A. Tauras stood  out  from those made by most of the speakers. In his opinion,  Lithuania should be a neutral, peaceful, and demilitarized  country, and he again cited the seeking of neutrality and the  guarantee of economic development as the fundamental purposes of  foreign policy.    Seimas members L. Andrikiene and R. Ozolas found the  statements they heard lacking in conceptual terms, in terms of  foreign policy goals, and in terms of strategy. Ozolas blamed  all members of Seimas for the lack of a conceptual framework,  because in his opinion, there can be no foreign policy concept  if there is no conceptual framework for the country. Ozolas also  proposed creation by Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia of a plan  for comprehensive defense against a possible threat.    Characterizing in general terms the discussion that had  taken  place, the foreign minister asserted that it had been useful. He  proposed to the opposition that it formulate a conceptual  framework for foreign policy and guaranteed that no one will  need to go underground in the wake of this discussion. In  concluding, the minister said, "Let the people discharge the  responsibility that they are assuming."</p>

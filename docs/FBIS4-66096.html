			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Andrew Marr article: "Nice Package, Shame About the Sales </F> Pitch"]    [Text] A little while ago, I was talking with a minister  about the standing of Michael Heseltine. What had Michael  actually done, asked the minister derisively. I listed some  things and added that there was the big competitiveness White  Paper coming. Long pause, stony stare. "I've seen it. You  haven't," he said.    It wasn't so bad. "Competitiveness" is just a long word for  hacking it. Along with "community" it has become one of those  polysyllables no well-dressed politician can be seen without.  But it matters more than most of what the Commons talks about.  In their announcements, Mr Heseltine and David Hunt, the  Employment Secretary, unveiled a series of useful proposals.  But their political impact was minimal, bathos by the  bucketful. It is worth asking why.    The recent Commons Trade and Industry Select Committee  report  on British manufacturing did a good job in clearing the  intellectual ground: its recommendations were rather more  radical than the Government could accept. Among the basic,  simple points it made are that the old national-industrial  strategies are futile in a world where so many companies are  international: "Decisions concerning UK manufacturing will  increasingly be determined by global economic forces, rather  than UK considerations...."    That is, if you like, a point against the left. But the  committee also demolished the idea that the solution for Britain  lies in wagecutting: "The industries and firms at most immediate  risk are lowskill, low-quality ones, including sections of UK  manufacturing." With the extremes of picking winners and  simplistic labour-market deregulation tossed aside, what remains  is a relatively small area of policy, on to which politicians  are now crowding. The heroic era in which enthusiasts for  corporatism and ministries of technology clashed thunderously  with privatisers and union-bashers has long passed. The debate  has moved on. Among the remedies most frequently mentioned now  are the need for better vocational training; "one-stop shops"  for small exporters and small companies generally; action to  stop business-killing late payments; and a serious look at the  role of the financial institutions in providing support for  manufacturing.    These familiar ideas formed the core of yesterday's White  Paper. It had the air of cabinet committee battles lost, of  grand projects overruled. But there were decent educational  proposals -- the new general diploma to help employers to  discover which schoolleavers have good basic skills will be  something teachers and parents will quickly focus on. The  recruitment of technology specialists and export counsellors to  staff 200 offices that are planned to help small businesses  echoes Labour manifestos but is none the worse for that In the  detail, there is plenty of sense.    Rather grandly, the President of the Board of Trade chided  Labour for not being more impressed. But the only way to make  an impact in an area where the parties are converging is to  surprise the country with the boldness of how you have grasped  the agenda. And whatever yesterday's White Paper may have been,  bold it wasn't. There was precious little new money. That does  not necessarily translate into Kenneth Clarke stuffing his  potential leadership rival Mr Heseltine, though such a thought  appeals to political romantics. But the lack of funding made it  more important for the measures to be sold with some panache.    Oddly, given Mr Heseltine's reputation, this modest and  evolutionary package was woodenly undersold. There were plenty  of "wide-ranging reviews," promises to develop this proposal  further and earnest offers to reconsider that one. "We will be  announcing later in the year ... We will be publishing a  consultative document . . . Work is in hand . . ."    The president solemnly revealed: "We will work with the  British Standards Institution and industry to develop BS5750 and  product certification standards further to promote continuous  improvement." Pericles it wasn't. After a few more minutes of  this, the opposition benches were roaring with relieved laughter  and a Labour spokesman was confidentially informing the press:  "That's it. Hezza's finished."    He is far from finished; and this was a serious, if  compromised and low-volume message. It had the feel of an  interventionist surge, broken on the rocks of the Treasury, yet  foaming still into a few crannies and rock pools. Given the  size of the deficit, could more have been said? It would have  been nice to see Mr Heseltine tackling with more gusto some of  the political and cultural issues surrounding competitiveness  policy. The importance of British commitment to the European  Union and past failures in education are among the issues he  would have found irresistible a few years ago.    Our culture is badly attuned to a world where jobs depend on  thousands of risk-taking small businesses, many of which  inevitably fail. We must get away from regarding bankruptcy as  an invariable stigma: sanctimonious MPs could have done with a  few robust home truths on those lines, too.    But the language of business and the language of politics  mix  badly. The age of grand pronouncements from government  ministries about the future of this industry or that is over:  bitter experience and the global market have rendered them  redundant, even absurd. Perhaps the most important lesson is  that industrial policy, having subsided to the level of detail  and fine print, is no longer something that can rouse the House  of Commons. Given its record, that may be the best news we've  had for some time.</p>

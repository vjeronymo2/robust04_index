			<p>BFN     [Text] There are adverse environment conditions over as  much as 20 percent of Russian territory, Environment Minister  Danilov-Danilyan said in Moscow on Wednesday. He said his  ministry demanded a special resolution to prevent Russia from  further dumping of liquid nuclear waste into the Sea of Japan.    He said the Ministry for Foreign Economic Relations was not  entitled to issue licences for imports of nuclear waste from  other countries until after the go-ahead from environmental  experts. However, the minister said that much too often, nuclear  waste was imported into Russia under the guise of materials  intended for reprocessing as evidenced by a recent incident in  Orenburg.    The minister denied media accusations that Prime Minister  Viktor Chernomyrdin signed a deal on imports of liquid nuclear  waste from Hungary for reprocessing in Russia. He blamed Atomic  Energy Minister Viktor Mikhaylov for signing this deal instead.    The minister said the agreement did not go through an  ecological safety study and "is therefore illegal."    Danilov-Danilyan called for a review of all previous  international agreements on nuclear waste disposal in Russia to  be followed by parliamentary ratification.</p>

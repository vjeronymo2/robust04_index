			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / 'Bolshevik' leads capitalist revolution: 'Let them eat cake' becomes rallying cry of Russia's privatisation A PASTRY-MAKING company called 'Bolshevik' will be among the first to point the way to the privatised economy, Russian officials said yesterday. It will be one of six large companies to be put on the market this month to provide an example to citizens of how to use their Rbs10,000 privatisation vouchers, expected to be distributed to all by the end of the year. Some 5,000 big enterprises, worth an estimated Rbs1,500bn are to be sold off from January 1, according to Mr Anatoly Chubais, the deputy prime minister in charge of privatisation. Mr Dmitri Vasiliev, deputy head of the privatisation committee, said yesterday that 'it's hard to tell whether the (enterprises) are future giants or if they're bankrupt, because of the unstable situation in the market'. However, the first large enterprises will come to the market within two weeks in Moscow, St Petersburg, Vladivostok in the Far East and Perm in the Urals. They have been carefully prepared by the government and foreign advisers. The most famous, for Russians, is Bolshevik, a 2,200-employee cake-maker which makes some of the sweetest products on the market. Mr Oleg Shumanov, Bolshevik's managing director, said the workers and management had chosen to privatise their company by taking 51 per cent of the shares - with the remainder being offered for auction to citizens for their vouchers. The company has been working with Credit Suisse First Boston on a system which will allow voucher holders to come to a Moscow sales centre from December 9 to apply for shares - the price of which will be set by demand. Mr Boris Jordan, a CSFB executive in Moscow, said Bolshevik had been chosen for its brand recognition, its size, the fact that it was in Moscow and its enthusiasm to be privatised. Together with the other plants, the experience of the sale of Bolshevik will be analysed for use in the mass privatisations by the government in consultation with its financial advisers.</p>

			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Australia plea to Chinese over wool AUSTRALIA'S prime minister urged China yesterday to lower tariffs and reduce quotas on wool imports as a further step towards satisfying requirements for membership of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, Tony Walker reports from Beijing. Mr Paul Keating, on a two-day visit to Beijing, also held out the prospect of a closer partnership between the two countries in the production of woollen items. China imports about 66 per cent of its raw wool needs. Australia is sitting on a huge stockpile of wool which has depressed the market to its lowest level in years.</p>

He said that if the Court of  Constitutional Guarantees determines the measures are  unconstitutional, the government will appeal the decision to the  Supreme Court of Justice, which will have the final word. The  Court of Constitutional Guarantees will submit a final report on  the demands presented by three political parties regarding the  unconstitutionality of the economic measures adopted by the  government.

Speaking to the  press in Bonn on Friday [7 January], Vogel rejected a report in  the HANNOVERSCHE ALLGEMEINE ZEITUNG that Ruehe is opposed to  Kohl in this matter.    According to Vogel, the minister telephoned the chancellor  on  Friday to assure him that he agreed with him and Foreign  Minister Klaus Kinkel that Hungary, Poland, and the Czech and  Slovak Republics should be the first to be offered the U.S.  Partnership for Peace proposal at the NATO summit in Brussels  next Monday. The Defense Ministry said that Ruehe takes the view  that the NATO expansion should be shaped "as a process which  should be initiated at the NATO summit." The minister sees the  Partnership for Peace initiative as an important stage in this  process, but not as a substitute for the expansion of NATO.  [Passage omitted]</p>

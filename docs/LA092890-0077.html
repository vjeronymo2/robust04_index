			<p><P> September 28, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DAVID NELSON ON RESTAURANTS: SPAGHETTI AND MEATBALLS HAVE THE STARRING ROLES AT  LA SCALA  </P> <P> It has become so common to open an Italian menu and find a listing for angel  hair pasta with sun-dried tomatoes, virgin olive oil and fresh basil that it  comes almost as a shock to scan a list and read a mention of spaghetti with  meatballs.  </P> <P> Dishes of that sort used to supply the raison d'etre of most local Italian  restaurants -- and not so very long ago at that. In the San Diego of 1980,  pasta almost invariably arrived in red sauce, except at the "Continental"  eateries that made a production of tossing fettuccine Alfredo at table as a  costly first course "prepared for a minimum of two," as the menus always noted.  Any restaurant-goers who can't remember those days moved here after the Padres  took the pennant.  </P> <P> Spaghetti with meatballs can be a lyrical dish, especially on a moody day, but  only if the sauce shows a modicum of finesse and only if the hands that shaped  the meatballs molded them lightly, so that they seem airy and insubstantial and  almost like dumplings. Meatballs whose heft and texture suggests that they  might be miniature cannon balls most emphatically do not make the grade.  </P> <P> All of which brings us to La Scala, a long-running Point Loma favorite whose  kitchen has yet to acknowledge the existence of sun-dried tomatoes, radicchio  lettuce or buckwheat pasta adorned with flash-grilled baby vegetables. The menu  instead is the sort that ran for decades as the definitive list, back in the  days when the vernacular described basic Italian restaurants as spaghetti  houses.  </P> <P> Spaghetti in several simple presentations does play a central role at La Scala.  Also of some importance are mostaciolli baked with layerings of mozzarella  cheese (the relatively austere forebear of America's macaroni and cheese),  cannelloni and lasagna. Veal and chicken appear in all the usual guises -- alla  Marsala, piccata, parmigiana -- and a fairly extensive seafood list offers a  good selection of shrimp, squid, clam and mussel preparations. Like most of San  Diego's old-style Italian houses with pizza ovens, La Scala also offers  calzone, in this case stuffed simply with ricotta and mozzarella.  </P> <P> The appetizer list does go so far as a dish of mussels and clams steamed in  seasoned white wine, but otherwise contents itself with a plate of prosciutto,  Provolone and roasted peppers, and a more elaborate appetizer of cheeses,  salami, olives, lettuce and the pungent, salty, pickled vegetable mix called  giardiniera. This platter is portioned so generously that a small order will  more than satisfy three guests and quite possibly overwhelm a party of two.  </P> <P> Formal entrees include a dinner salad -- redundant at tables that have indulged  in an antipasto -- that is so basic in its components as to seem the definition  of ordinariness.  </P> <P> Slightly unusual pasta offerings include baked gnocchi in meat sauce and  shell-shaped macaroni with broccoli, a dish that, whatever its merits, has  little chance of being served to the current occupants of the White House.  Otherwise, the list is quite in the mainstream, and the tomato sauce that  washes across much of it has the fragrance and flavor that, no matter what  length of time has intervened since one's last acquaintance, always seem  instantly familiar. A guest who ordered this sauce enriched with fresh  mushrooms and poured over an immense platter of spaghetti pronounced himself  thoroughly pleased. On a different occasion, the tomato sauce was equally happy  over rigatoni, but the meatballs ordered as garnish belonged to the cannonball  school. These tough little orbs had been packed, squashed, man-handled and  cooked until they were dry, hard and mean, which is not much of a  recommendation for a meatball.  </P> <P> Many of the descriptions tacked on to the entree listings mention "spices"  among the ingredients. This term, usually used in tandem with herbs on both  menus and packaged food labels, typically means black pepper, with the herb in  question normally nothing fancier than parsley. A server was incapable of  defining just what the spices involved in the veal piccata might be, but there  did seem some curious undertones of flavor in this likable presentation. It  also varied from the norm in including egg yolk in the sauce, so that it seemed  a sort of light but unctuous Italian hollandaise.  </P> <P> The menu also specifies fresh oregano for the veal pizzaiola, a seasoning not  employed everywhere but one that certainly would give the dish a new life. A  more generous inclusion of meat in the veal and eggplant Sorrentino, meanwhile,  might have added a little life to this sorry preparation, which consisted  mostly of soggy, heavily breaded eggplant slices stewing under pools of tomato  sauce and melted cheese.  </P> <P> There are flashes of originality on the chicken list; one dish tucks a boneless  breast and several shrimp under a coverlet of white sauce. The most unusual may  be the saltimbocca Riccardo, a most unusual variation on the veal saltimbocca  theme that teams baked chicken and prosciutto with tortellini in cheese sauce.  </P> <P> The menu also mentions calamari parmigiana for those who like this style of  preparation but shun meat (or really like squid), and the rather more dressy  squid steak alla nunzia, which is sauteed with garlic and mushrooms and  finished with a deglazing sauce of sherry and lemon juice. The frutti di mare  alla Luigi combines various shellfish with marinara sauce and more of those  mysterious spices, while the scampi pesto contents itself with the pungent,  familiar basil sauce, in this case tossed with angel hair pasta. La Scala  recently made a good pesto, but the shrimp seemed a little long in the tooth.  </P> <P> The choice of desserts includes a fairly stiff zabaglione, or egg-Marsala  custard, and rather nice cannoli in which the identity of the spice is by no  means a mystery. The ricotta cheese filling is highly seasoned with cinnamon  and very pleasing because of it.  </P> <P> This casual but comfortable eatery is far from new, and moved to its present  premises at Scott and Canon streets some five years ago. The restaurant's  nearness to Shelter Island and the yacht basins ensures that on many nights the  clientele will be a lively mix of neighborhood residents and boating  enthusiasts.  </P> <P> </P> <P> LA SCALA  </P> <P> 1101 Scott St.  </P> <P> 224-2272  </P> <P> Lunch and dinner daily.  </P> <P> Credit cards accepted.  </P> <P> Dinner for two, including a glass of wine each, tax and tip, $25 to $50.  </P></p>

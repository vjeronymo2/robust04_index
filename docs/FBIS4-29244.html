			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 15 (KCNA) -- Foreign newspapers  strongly urged the United States and the South Korean  authorities to pull down the concrete wall built by them in the  area South of the Military Demarcation Line.    The Ghanaian paper GHANA TIMES said that the United States  and the South Korean authorities have built the concrete wall  for the purpose of perpetuating the division of Korea and  blocking the people's movement for reunification.    The Dutch paper MANIFEST said that the South Korean  authorities, instigated by the United States, have built the  concrete wall under the pretext of preventing a fictitious  "invasion from the North" and committed an anti-national crime  to keep divided forever the Korean people who have lived as a  homogeneous nation, boasting of the 5,000-year long history and  brilliant culture.    The Indian magazine STUDENTS' FORUM said that with the  concrete wall built the fellow countrymen in the North and the  South are unable to freely come and go and inquire after the  health of their families and relatives and overall opening in  all realms of politics, the economy and culture between the  North and the South is blocked.    The Peruvian paper LA REPUBLICA said that there is no wall  in  the area north of the Military Demarcation Line but wire  entanglements marking the boundary line. It said that to pull  down the concrete wall is the will of the Korean people and the  requirement of the times and the preservation of the concrete  wall is a shame of the nation.</p>

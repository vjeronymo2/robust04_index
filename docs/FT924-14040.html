			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / Siemens plans to cut workforce by a further 2,300 TWO of Germany's leading multinationals yesterday blamed falling demand and prices in markets for electronics for the planned loss of almost 3,000 jobs. Siemens, the electrical and electronics engineering giant, said it had been forced to speed up rationalisation of its loss-making semiconductor business. The division, which has already shed almost 2,000 jobs this year, plans to reduce its international workforce by a further 2,300 to 11,000 by the time restructuring is complete in 1995, Mr Jurgen Knorr, managing director, said yesterday. Timing of the cuts would depend on market developments, he said, painting a gloomy picture of current prospects. Meanwhile, BASF unveiled plans to close two audio and video cassette factories by the end of next year and reduce its payroll by 570. The announcements add to a rapidly growing tally of job losses among leading German manufacturers, which are now feeling the full effects of international recession coupled with a rapid slowdown in the domestic economy. Other recent cuts include the loss of 7,500 jobs at Deutsche Aerospace, the aircraft and space division of Daimler-Benz. Earlier this year the group said it was to reduce the payroll at its Mercedes-Benz vehicles subsidiary by 20,000. Mr Knorr said prices for semiconductors had fallen 20 per cent and sales to important customers such as television, audio and engineering companies were down 25 per cent. While the division had managed to maintain total turnover at around last year's DM2bn (Pounds 800m) by stepping up volume sales by 10 per cent, there had been no significant impact on losses. The Siemens semiconductor business lost DM500m last year. However, Mr Knorr claimed, markets were expected to improve next year thanks to increased demand from mobile telephone manufacturers, the conventional telecommunications industry, and the motor industry. BASF Magnetics, a subsidiary of the BASF chemicals group, which lost DM234m last year on sales of DM2bn, said its tape factory in Ettenheim, Germany, would close by the middle of next year and a works in Gien, France, would be shut by the end of 1993. The company, which first announced plans to close the Ettenheim works last year, and then shelved them following protests from the workforce, does not expect to return to profit until 1994. Eastern Germany imported DM5.18bn from western Germany in July, up 25 per cent from a year ago, the Federal Statistics Office reported yesterday, AP-DJ reports from Wiesbaden. Goods flowing to western Germany from eastern Germany in July amounted to DM736m, 12 per cent less than in July 1991, the agency added. In the first seven months of July, eastern Germany imported DM34.17bn from the 11 western states, 42 per cent more than the same period a year earlier. Exports to western Germany rose 10 per cent to DM5.79bn. Olivetti, the Italian conglomerate, is to close its Triumph-Adler computer factory in Nuremberg at the cost of about 1,000 jobs.</p>

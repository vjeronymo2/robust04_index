This was reported by company exports manager Rubem  Faggiano. The .12-gauge Pomba-230 shotguns will be inspected on  21 March by the Royal Thai Army-Bangkok, and will be shipped  immediately from the Port of Rio Grande. The payment will be  made in cash through a letter of credit, Faggiano reported.    This is the first sale Rossi has made to Thailand after  winning an international bid last October. Rossi Inc.  manufactures nearly 20,000 Pomba-230 shotguns per year, 7,000 of  which are exported to Argentina. "New markets for this kind of  weapon are opening in Africa and the Middle East," Faggiano  said. Five hundred shotguns, which will be shipped in April,  were sold to Papua New Guinea for $30,000, Faggiano said.    Long-barrel weapons are responsible for less than 20 percent  of Rossi's sales. About 3,500 of these weapons are manufactured  per month. The $30 million sales Rossi made in 1993 were  principally obtained through the sale of handguns, of which  Rossi manufactures 20,000 to 22,000 per month.    Handgun exports amounted to $18 million last year in  comparison with $14 million in 1992 and $9 million in 1991. From  40 to 45 percent of the export production is sold in the U.S.  market. Last January, the special Rossi 720 .44-caliber with a  four-inch barrel for five shots, received an award as "the best  imported handgun" from the American Fire Arms Institute  [preceding four words in English] made up of U.S. weapons  manufacturers.    This year, Rossi will launch a .22-caliber Magnum revolver  and the entire .357-caliber Magnum line with ventilated ribs and  stainless steel parts. Rossi also will launch the six-bullet  Snubby revolver, a .38-caliber special (SPL) small gun that  weighs nearly 700 grams and which is being manufactured for five  bullets so far.</p>

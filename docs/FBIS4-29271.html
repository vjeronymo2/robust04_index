			<p>BFN     [Text] The Democratic Liberal Party [DLP] urged the  government to reconsider [chaegomto] the Joint Declaration on  the Denuclearization of the Korean peninsula if  non-implementation continues.    Some 250 lawmakers of the DLP and of district party chapters  held a series of meetings today in presence of Foreign Minister  Han Sung- chu and Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae to seek measures  to actively cope with [nungdongjoguro taechohanun panganul  mosaek] the North Korean nuclear issue that is becoming  increasingly strained with each day [nallo kinbakhaejyo kago  innun].    While reading a report entitled "Our Party's Basic Position  on the North Korean Nuclear Issue," the DLP lawmakers and  chairmen of party chapters said that the North Korea's ambition  [yayok] to develop nuclear weapons is a serious challenge  [chungdaehan tojon] that threatens the peace and security of the  Korean peninsula, and stressed that it can never be allowed.</p>

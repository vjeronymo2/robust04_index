			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / International Company News: Higher exports lift Trans-Natal INCREASED exports higher rand prices and improved productivity helped Trans-Natal, the coal arm of Gencor, the South African industrial group, to lift attributable profits by 4 per cent for the year to June. The improved export climate helped boost sales to R1.56bn (Dollars 563m) from R1.43bn a year earlier, while the cost of sales rose by only 7 per cent to R1.34bn from R1.25bn. Operating income was therefore 25 per cent higher at R226.2m compared with R180.4m. Attributable profits rose by only 4 per cent to R143.6m from R138.1m after the tax charge rose 125 per cent. The dividend is being lifted to 80 cents a share from 75 cents. Mr Mike Salamon, managing director, cautioned that the downturn in the world economy and severely depressed spot prices, because of large amounts of low cost coal from Russia and Indonesia, meant that earnings would not be maintained in the current year. Increased demand and market share in Spain, Germany and Japan lifted exports sales to 11.3m tonnes from 10.6m tonnes in 1991. Sales to the inland market were 5.3 per cent lower, at 5.4m tonnes due to lower demand for metallurgical coal. Sun International Bophutatswana (Sunbop), the South African casino resort group, overcame a proliferation of unregulated gaming operations and difficult operating conditions to increase earnings by 13 per cent for the year to June. Turnover rose 30 per cent to reach R1bn from R772.5m, Margins were lower so operating profits rose by 17 per cent to R269.2m from R229.5m. Mr Sol Kerzner, chairman, said the opening of the rival Carousel resort in November hit revenues of his group's Marula Sun and Sun City. Interest income also fell to R1m from R27m following the use of cash to develop Carousel and the R750m Lost City project at Sun City, a Disneyland-type scheme scheduled to open in December. Attributable earnings rose 13 per cent to R216m from R191.8m, but earnings per share were only 8 per cent higher at 191 cents, against 177 cents, following a rights issue and two scrip dividends. The dividend is being maintained at 132 cents a share. Mr Kerzner predicted earnings for the current financial year would 'at least approximate those of the past year.'</p>

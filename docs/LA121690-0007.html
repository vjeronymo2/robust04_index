			<p><P> December 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> I was appalled to turn on my favorite late night news program "Nightline" (ABC,  Dec. 3) and find Madonna and her video the evening's topic.  </P> <P> I called KABC to complain and was further shocked when I was told my opinion  was "a refreshing change" from the other calls the station was receiving.  </P> <P> My complaint was simple. I objected to Channel 7's use of precious airtime of  Madonna and her hardly news-worthy video. I was told most calls were complaints  about morality.  </P> <P> Why don't the news programs just keep us up to date on current crises and leave  the trash to trash TV?  </P> <P> Leslie Myrick, Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [The following item did not appear in the 22 April Morning </F> Edition of MAINICHI SHIMBUN]    [Text] Because of the situation on the Korean peninsula,  Ichiro Ozawa, Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] secretary general,  and other lawmakers are talking about "emergency defense  legislation" at the ruling parties' policy meeting. In this  regard, Shigeru Hatakeyama, administrative vice minister of the  Defense Agency [DA], said at a news conference on 20 April that  "The emergency defense legislation that Mr. Ozawa is talking  about is different from the general emergency legislation that  we studied before in terms of its characteristics and range of  influence." He explained his opinion that Ozawa's "emergency  defense legislation" is not general legislation but rather a  concept designed to deal with the DPRK's suspected nuclear  weapons development program.    Hatakeyama first said that "the general emergency  legislation  deals with various peacetime regulations regarding movements of  the Self-Defense Forces [SDF] during emergencies." He then  explained his view, saying, "I think that lawmakers, when they  talk about the emergency defense legislation, must keep in mind  the cooperation that Japan can give to the international  community, as well as the support that Japan can provide to the  U.S. military, when the UN Security Council adopts a resolution  to deal with an emergency situation on the Korean peninsula."    As for "collective security," Hatakeyama said that "the DA  does not have a particular definition concerning actions for  collective security." However, on the question of whether the  SDF can cooperate with the international community in the area  of logistics to deal with an emergency on the Korean peninsula  within the scope of the current laws, Hatakeyama explained his  understanding that "there are many things we cannot do unless we  give power to the SDF by revising the current laws or by  introducing new laws."</p>

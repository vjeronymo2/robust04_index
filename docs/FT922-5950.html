			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / Business Law: Database copyright raises dilemma The legal tensions resulting from the European single market are highlighted in the current proposal to introduce a uniform protection for databases. National laws are particularly discordant on this issue, with copyright denied by some and given generously by others. Predictably, the industry has developed most strongly where the protection is greatest - the UK. Comparable, preferably identical, legal treatment in all the countries of the single market is desirable, especially in view of the ease of access provided by telecommunications in this market. Distortions will inevitably emerge if users have to pay fees for access to a database in one country, while in another they can copy it with impunity. Yet any uniform legal treatment must be acceptable in all member countries. If some are to gain, any loss to the others must be perceived as necessary and manageable. The solution proposed by the EC Commission might improve the protection of databases in some places, but it would seriously limit the protection already available in the UK (and also in Ireland). The draft directive would provide two distinct sorts of protection. First, a specific 10-year protection would give the database owner an exclusive right not to have data unfairly extracted from the database. The public interest in having access to the information would be balanced by, for example, compulsory licensing of the extraction and reuse for commercial purposes of the material on the database if this was not available elsewhere. Second, the draft would extend regular copyright to databases on the analogy of collected works (such as anthologies), provided that the selection and arrangement of the collection were the original 'intellectual creation' of its author. This was inspired by the protection of collected works under article 2(5) of the Berne Copyright Convention, which all EC countries have ratified. That formula was agreed long before the invention of computers and, although it might allow an unobjectionable extension of non-UK concepts of copyright, is not appropriate for this purpose. The requirement of original selection or arrangement is problematic where the selection is exhaustive or where the arrangement is commonplace: arrangement of material in alphabetical order would not be regarded as an intellectually creative process anywhere except the British Isles. Even if the database were created by original selection and arrangement, the proposed copyright would not cover the materials contained in the database. However, the 'reproduction' of the database, in full or in part, would be restricted by copyright. This is rather difficult to understand; it suggests that use of material from the database would be restricted only if it replicated the selection and arrangement. In cases other than outright piracy, it would surely be the material contained in the database that people would want to copy. A database is simply a collection of information which, for present purposes, is electronically managed. It may be about anything at all - from telephone numbers to share prices, from racehorses to law - and may well be a collection of facts. The assembly of information almost always has a commercial value; the work of assembling it invariably involves a labour cost. A database normally includes all the information on a given subject. This feature often gives the database its peculiar value: selectivity of the contents would make it less valuable in the hands of the users, whose needs may be diverse. The database owner indexes the information so that the user can readily gain access to certain items. The user, rather than the owner, makes the selection. This comprehensive quality distinguishes UK law which, almost alone in the world, is willing to protect a mere assembly of facts with the full majesty of copyright. Most other copyright laws only protect the product of personal creativity, while unfair competition law protects the product of hard work from being purloined by other people. The difference between UK and continental copyright is embedded even in the terminology: copyright means the right in a text, while continental laws refer to the 'right of the author' (droit d'auteur, Urheberrecht). US law limits copyright in collections of facts to those which have some element of originality in their selection, co-ordination or arrangement. Although UK law does not protect a fact itself with copyright, it protects the expression of several facts in one place. For example, BT does not have copyright in my telephone number, so I am free to publish it and, moreover, to publish other telephone numbers I know personally. But I need BT's permission to publish names and numbers lifted in bulk from its own directory. The draft directive would lay down not only the minimum protection EC countries would have to give databases, but also the maximum. If EC law said that there would be no copyright in compilations of facts, UK law could not give any. The resulting loss of protection under UK copyright law would deal a body blow to the information industry. Hamish Sandison of Linklaters &amp; Paines, who has made a study of database protection in the EC, US and UK, takes the view that any meaningful protection for computerised databases under copyright law must cover the product of hard work, as well as of more intellectually creative activities. Although it raises a number of questions, the proposed 10-year protection is fundamentally less controversial than the copyright proposals. But simply leaving copyright to national law, apart from failing to help the single market, would have drawbacks. One is the rather awkward case law of the European Court of First Instance in the Magill litigation, now on appeal to the European Court of Justice: an exclusive right must not be exercised in such a way that it impedes development of competition in the market. Leaving copyright law alone would probably lead many commercial databases to set up in the UK or Ireland. They could then make their contracts with users subject to English or Irish law, including copyright law. Even if the advantage to the UK and Ireland were swallowed by other EC countries, this solution might not work: enforcing the contract against a user in another country might be challenged on the basis that it offended local notions of public policy (ordre public), and problems might arise where the database passed out of the contracted user's hands, for example on a compact disc. UK copyright is admittedly something of a sledgehammer: the owner has exclusive rights over the compilation for at least 50 years. The courts extended copyright in lists of facts to fill the gap left by the absence of unfair competition law. Droit d'auteur lawyers would object to this, because the compiler could exclude others from access to facts which should be in the public domain. UK lawyers, however, already have to live with the EC concept of abuse in the exercise of an exclusive right. A possible solution would be to extend UK copyright throughout the EC for electronic databases. The 10-year protection would then be redundant, and the licensing provisions would have to be attached to the new copyright. But this would discriminate between computer-based and other compilations, and a conflict would arise where the database was not wholly electronic ('arranged, stored and accessed by electronic means', in the words of the draft). UK business might be willing to accept a curtailment of copyright if UK law  -including any EC directive - embodied a good general protection against unfair competition. The Commission's present draft misses the point. An extension of the droit d'auteur to cover compilations concentrating on selection would normally be useless because any selection process contradicts the purpose of most databases. Worse, it would destroy the existing protection provided by UK law. Unless a better Europe-wide system can be devised, the UK model gives the young European database industry a benign helping hand in international competition.

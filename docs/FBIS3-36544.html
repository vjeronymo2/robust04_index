Ibragim Sulaymenov, one of the opposition leaders, demanded  on Monday that Dudayev step down as the republic's president,  "make public his accounts in western banks for one billion U.S.  dollars and choose which court -- secular or sheriat -- he wants  to be tried by."    Apparently, Chechen leaders do not consider Sulaymenov's  ultimatum carried by some mass media worth their attention.  According to reports from Grozny, the capital of the Chechen  Republic, the situation in the republic is "surprisingly calm"  and is under the president's control.</p>

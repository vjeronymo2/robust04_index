Khasbulatov, who was recently  regarded as persona non grata in the republic.    Surrounded by bodyguards, the former Lefortovo prisoner is  traveling around Groznyy accompanied by a motorcade of foreign  cars to be welcomed by machine-gun and assault-rifle salutes  from his fellow tribesmen. There was an enthusiastic welcome in  his native village, where horse races involving the most  daredevil and skillful horsemen were timed specially for his  arrival. Reporters from local, Russian, and international news  agencies were present in abundance.    Khasbulatov's trip to his homeland with the avowed aim of  visiting his elderly mother took on major political significance  for the republic the moment his aircraft touched down at Groznyy  airport. The guest was met at the ramp not just by his  brothers, close relatives, and representatives of the Kharachoy  clan, which, incidentally, is one of the many distinguished  clans in Chechnya. (A village bearing this name survives to this  day in the mountainous area of the republic. One representative  of this clan -- the bandit avenger Zelimkhan Kharacheyevskiy,  who devoted his life to struggling against the czarist forces --  was well known in prerevolutionary Russia). Many inhabitants of  Chechnya considered it their duty to meet with their  distinguished compatriot.    However, the present enthusiasm in the republic is not quite  as instinctive as it was two-and-a-half years ago, when Ruslan  Imranovich assumed the office of chairman of the Russian Supreme  Soviet. At that time he was the republic's national hero. But  his neutrality over attempting to impose order in Chechnya by  strong-arm methods came as an unpleasant surprise to his  enraptured fellow citizens. So the current rejoicing is mingled  with wariness: What plans does this man have in Chechnya? His  possible opposition to the present regime in Groznyy and the  possibility of his making a bid for power in the republic would,  by the admission of a staffer at the Chechen Republic Department  for Information and the Press who wished to remain anonymous in  the newspaper, constitute an extremely dangerous threat to  Dudayev.    This is apparently why official Groznyy is trying to be  markedly attentive to its distinguished guest, who has regained  the sympathy of thousands of his compatriots during his period  of disfavor. President Dudayev took the first steps towards  reconciliation with his arch-opponent in good time: He returned  to Khasbulatov the Chechen citizenship of which he had been  stripped, and immediately before his release from Lefortovo he  stated his belief that the Chechen prisoner was innocent. He  attempted to display honor befitting this lofty statesman at  Groznyy airport as well, where the president's secretary of  state and aide greeted the guest. But the exultant crowd pushed  aside the senior officials and prevented them from getting close  to their idol, whom they mobbed in a fit of enthusiasm.    On the third day of his stay in Chechnya, Khasbulatov  visited  the memorial built to honor the victims of the deportation of  the Chechen people, whom the president's supporters call  "Dzhokhar's children," and spoke at a small rally there.    Whatever happens in Chechnya, official Groznyy is currently  hoping for something else -- that the Chechen celebrity, whose  popularity at a time when the republic is in a state of collapse  represents a real danger for President Dudayev, will depart as  soon as possible for the Russian capital.</p>

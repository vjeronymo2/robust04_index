			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Labour of gastronomic love - A very individual food guide I SAT opposite my guest at a booth in Bentley's in the west end of London and for the next two hours we talked restaurants. There was no overt criticism of any particular establishment as there might have been if my guest had been a restaurateur, nor were there any of the guarded comments that can often be exchanged by two restaurant writers keen to protect information and sources of gossip. But, in spite of my own enthusiasm and knowledge of restaurants, after our talk I knew that I had met my match. My guest, Thomas Henkel, a 44-year-old senior manager with Conoco, who manages its 270-strong fleet of chemical tankers from the gastronomic wasteland of Wilmington, Delaware, had been to more restaurants, hotels and bars than most people in the food business. And he had catalogued them all. Since he took up this hobby in the mid-1980s he had compiled a computer list, based on visits to more than 500 American eateries. Then, in late 1987, in a move which he described as one of the greatest pieces of good fortune in his life, he had been transferred to London when the American dollar was strong. He was quick to take advantage of all that Britain could offer and then, when his job expanded, he travelled widely abroad. After 4 1/2 -years his word processor contained 1,789 entries including 1,001 on the UK, 62 on Germany, 39 on Spain and 57 on China and 19 on Tibet, part of a holiday Henkel organised with the proviso that he organise all the meals personally. Since his return to the US Henkel has put together another list containing more than 500 American entries so that his total now stands at just under 3,000. Each entry gives all the usual particulars, the bill's total, a recommended table or room a short, descriptive note and a rating out of 10. His rating philosophy is based on an amalgamation of food, service, ambience and, most importantly, he believes, an appreciation of what the restaurant is trying to be. This allows him to rate a good local bistro on the same basis as a fine restaurant. Top marks go to Comme chez Soi, Brussels, Im Schiffchen, Dusseldorf, and L'Arlequin in London. Bottom of the class is a pub in London's West End and a bar in Texas. Finally, there are four graphs highlighting restaurant costs, cuisine types, number of visits per week and restaurant locations. Although Henkel is aware of the commercial possibilities of his guide he is reluctant to pursue them at present. He enjoys his job with Conoco but says compiling the guide is a hobby which has made him a worldwide network of friends. For a copy of Thomas Henkel's Guide send a self-addressed envelope to 16 Fox Hill Lane, Greenville, Delaware 19807, USA.</p>

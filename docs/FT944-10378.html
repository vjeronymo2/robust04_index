			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / International Company News: Hagemeyer raises Fl 90m in placement Hagemeyer, the Dutch products and food trading group, has raised Fl 90m (Dollars 52.9m) of new capital in a private placement of 677,617 ordinary shares, AP-DJ reports. The issue, announced earlier this year, will increase the total number of shares outstanding by 4.7 per cent. The Naarden-based group also announced it had placed a Dollars 45m, five-year, floating-rate exchangeable subordinated note issue with Dutch institutional investors. The notes, designed to improve the structure of debt rather than increase the burden, are exchangeable into minority equity at the option of Hagemeyer. 'Both transactions fit Hagemeyer's financial aim to keep its shareholders' equity at a level of between 25 and 30 per cent of balance sheet total,' Hagemeyer said. Its Hong Kong parent company, First Pacific, participated in the share offering to hold its stake unchanged at 50.04 per cent. The remainder of the newly-issued common shares have been placed with a small number of foreign and domestic investors, who paid a price at market average. Hagemeyer, which has expanded this year through the takeover of UK electro-technical wholesaler Newey &amp; Eyre and a joint venture in Asia, said it expected earnings per share to rise in 1994, from last year's Fl 11.37.</p>

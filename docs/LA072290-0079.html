			<p><P> July 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRESERVATION AND PROPERTY RIGHTS  </P> <P> I've maintained my home in Hollywood for 40 years, still enjoy it despite many  changes it has undergone over that span of four decades.  </P> <P> I read with interest of the efforts of the city's Cultural Heritage Commission  to "save" the building at 1717 Vine St. that housed the Ontra Cafeteria (Times  Westside, Sunday, July 1).  </P> <P> That building, the home of Hollywood's first post office, was destroyed by fire  a few months ago. The city has demanded of the building's owner, who already  has a considerable investment in the property, that he invest still more to pay  for earthquake reinforcement. The owner has decided instead to level the  structure and put a parking lot there. Incredibly, the commission forced the  owner to secure a court order to make that use of his own property. Superior  Court Judge William Masterson reached the sound and correct conclusion that the  commission had, indeed, abused its authority in declaring that the structure is  a historic monument, thus shielded from destruction by its owner.  </P> <P> Displeased with the only logical and lawful decision the court could make, the  commission's chairman complained that "The judge has made the wrong decision,  without (even) looking at the building." Had His Honor looked at the building,  he'd have been all the more certain that its owner should not be restrained  from leveling it to make way for a parking lot.  </P> <P> I don't know the commission chairman or the property owner. My concern is the  commission's utter disregard for the latter's rights and for inexcusable waste  of taxpayer monies to defend the commission's groundless actions. To me, it is  clear that the commission needs some personnel changes.  </P> <P> MARCUS M. HOOD  </P> <P> Hollywood  </P></p>

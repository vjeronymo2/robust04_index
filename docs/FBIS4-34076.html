			<p>BFN     [Text] Our government will begin to receive about $100  million per year in revenues from the Salto Grande hydroelectric  dam project following the signing by Uruguayan Foreign Minister  Sergio Abreu and Argentine Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella  yesterday in Buenos Aires of an agreement on the exchange of  notes on financial streamlining, a new rate system, and a future  reorganization of the Salto Grande Joint Technical Commission.    This agreement marks the completion of one stage of this  joint hydroelectric project, which began on 1 April 1974, and  the opening of a promising cooperation stage in the field of  electric power interconnection as it follows existing efforts  toward full electric power integration between Argentina and  Uruguay.    The agreement complements an act signed a few days ago  within  the framework of an agreement on electric power interconnection.  Under this act, Argentina will purchase Uruguay's surplus  electricity from its Salto Grande dam at 80 percent of the  Argentine spot [preceding word in English] market prices.    The financial streamlining of the Salto Grande Joint  Technical Commission is the main outcome of the agreement.  Thanks to the compensation [not further specified] on its loans  and debts, the Salto Grande Joint Technical Commission will have  no liability whatsoever.    The agreement also provides for the payment of a debt  arising  from compensation that Uruguay had to honor, involving unpaid  dam construction loans and UTE [General Administration of State  Electric Power and Telephones] bills totaling about $380  million. These bills will be paid directly by UTE to the  Argentine Republic, which has granted an 11-year deadline.    This financial streamlining paves the way for the  hydroelectric project to immediately yield about $100 million  per year in revenues for our government.    This agreement also opens a negotiations stage for  reorganizing the Salto Grande Joint Technical Commission. The  negotiations will seek to reorganize the commission's  jurisdiction, concentrating its activities in electric power  output and distribution and the adjustment of its operation  costs.    The agreement establishes the formation of a working group,  coordinated by the two Foreign Ministries, to submit within 60  days a report on the binational agency's institutional  reorganization.</p>

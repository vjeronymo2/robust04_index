			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Hangzhou, March 10 (XINHUA) -- East China's  Zhejiang Province is encouraging scientific workers to set up  more nongovernmental hi-tech enterprises to boost the local  high-tech industry.    According to the latest statistics, the province has about  4,000 such enterprises, employing 110,000 people.    These enterprises are involved in the fields of machinery  and  electronics, gauges and meters, bio-chemicals, genetic  engineering, medicine and the combination of machinery and  electrical appliances.    Many of them generate an annual output value of at least ten  million yuan each a year.    Under the centrally planned economy, research institutions  used to undertake projects assigned by the government, which  allocated limited funds and took charge of the findings.    Such a system could hardly arouse the enthusiasm of  scientific workers for research work, a provincial government  official explained.    During the current reform of the management of science and  technology, research institutions have more say in their work,  and scientific workers are encouraged to set up independent  hi-tech industrial enterprises at their own expense, at the same  time assuming sole responsibility for their profits and losses.  They are also encouraged to apply their research findings to  production.    One example is the Hangzhou General Electrical Appliance  Company, a nongovernmental enterprise specializing in  telecommunications.    Founded in 1990 with self-raised funds of more than 100,000  yuan, the company generates an annual output value exceeding 100  million yuan and profits climbing to 10 million yuan a year.    The company has 140 employees, including 30 people with  doctor's and master's degrees.    The company has developed a series of advanced  program-controlled telephone exchanges to meet the needs of the  market.    Another example is the Hangzhou Organic Silicon New Material  Development and Application Company, a nongovernmental  enterprise combining science and industry with trade.    Many of the products, including HS-900 seal mat coat  material, SI building waterproofing agent and HS-T-3 silicon  resin, developed by the company have filled the gaps in China's  science and technology.    The company has just transferred 15 research findings to a  Singapore company, and is using the money earned therefrom to  build new workshops and other production facilities.    The Hangzhou Feishida Computer Technology Company has been  paying close attention to employing scientists and technicians,  and offering better working and living conditions for them ever  since its founding five years ago.    With 20 research workers, the company has developed FGC  color  high-resolution video control boards and other computer software  series.    After inspecting the company, Song Jian, minister in charge  of the State Science and Technology Commission, highly praised  it for making great contributions to the computer industry.    An official of the Zhejiang provincial society for  nongovernmental industrialists specializing in science and  technology said that the rise of nongovernmental enterprises in  science has paved the way for transforming scientific findings  to productivity, and enabled more and more people to see clearly  the functions and value of scientists and technicians in the  country's economic development.</p>

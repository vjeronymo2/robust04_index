			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / International Company News: New World Development profits rise 24% to HKDollars 4.3bn for year New World Development, the Hong Kong property, hotels and infrastructure group, yesterday reported a 24 per cent rise in net profits to HKDollars 4.3bn (USDollars 558m), from HKDollars 3.5bn, for the year to June 30. The results were broadly in line with market forecasts. Gross income from property sales last year totalled HKDollars 6.3bn, a 31 per cent improvement over the previous year. However, rental income edged up 8.5 per cent to HKDollars 1.4bn from HKDollars 1.3bn. On a fully diluted basis, earnings per share rose 18 per cent to HKDollars 2.57 from HKDollars 2.17 the previous year. The directors are recommending a final dividend of 78 cents, up from 62 cents the previous year, to be paid in scrip or cash. The group has 17 projects in the pipeline, which will provide New World with a total entitlement of about 572,997 sq metres upon completion with about 92,350sq m to be completed before the end of the financial year. New World boasts one of the biggest landbanks in China among the Hong Kong property developers, and believes this will allow it to benefit from reforms and economic development across the border. In Hong Kong, where government measures and bank curbs on mortgage lending have depressed property prices, the group is equally confident of its prospects. Mr Henry Cheng, managing director, said consolidations would nurture a healthier and more stable environment for future property development. 'The fundamental factor supporting long-term growth in property value has remained unchanged with the facts that the demand far exceeds supply,' he said.</p>

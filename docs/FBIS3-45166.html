			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Y.C. Tsai] </F>   [Text] Taipei, Jan. 13 (CNA) -- The government is  promoting the "Southern Strategy" to cut Taiwan's investment  risk in Mainland China, Economic Affairs Minister P.K. Chiang  said Thursday [13 January].    The strategy encourages Taiwan manufacturers to invest more  in Vietnam and member countries of the Association of Southeast  Asian Nations (ASEAN), which groups Indonesia, Singapore,  Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Brunei.    Chiang made the remark in a nationwide radio program aired  by  the Broadcasting Corporation of China (BCC) in the morning.    Although the new investment drive is a "win-win" policy for  both Taiwan and Southeast Asian countries, the government will  respect whatever decisions domestic investors make, he noted.    The minister, however, cited active participation in the new  investment strategy as the best policy, saying traders should  follow business benefits.    Under the "Southern Strategy," which is also touted as the  "Guidelines for the Strengthening of Trade Ties With Southeast  Asia," the government will take the initiative to deal with  various governments to help promote the interests of Taiwan  investors, he elaborated.    If Taiwan investors don't go to Southeast Asia now, their  counterparts in other countries such as Japan, South Korea, and  the United States will, he warned.    In the initial stage, he added, the strategy will target  Vietnam, the Philippines, and Indonesia.    The three countries boast rich natural resources and an  abundant labor force, he said, suggesting that Taiwan investors  invest in agriculture, forestry, fishery, petrochemicals, and  labor-intensive industries.    Moreover, he revealed, the government is also pondering  cooperation with Indonesia on aerospace industry development.  The aerospace development package is still in the planning  stages, he added.    Chiang stressed that the "Southern Strategy" will produce  reciprocal benefits, saying increased Taiwan investments will  help boost the economies and upgrade the living standards in the  Southeast Asian countries, whose peoples in turn will have more  purchasing power to buy Taiwan-made products.</p>

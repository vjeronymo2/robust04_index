			<p><P> June 16, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: THOUSAND OAKS;  </P> <P> 2 FLEE IN STOLEN CAR AFTER JEWELRY THEFT  </P> <P> Two men robbed a Thousand Oaks jewelry store at gunpoint Friday, escaping in a  stolen car with $50,000 worth of jewelry, said a spokesman for the Ventura  County Sheriff's Department.  </P> <P> Lt. Bill Montigo said one man entered Emperor Jewelry at 140 W. Hillcrest Drive  about 1:40 p.m. brandishing a pistol and yelling at a female employee to flee.  </P> <P> Store owner Calvin Lau, 52, triggered the store's silent alarm and fled the  store with the unidentified employee, Montigo said. Neither worker was injured,  he said.  </P> <P> A second man joined the gunman in the store, witnesses told police.  </P> <P> The men took the custom-made jewelry and escaped in a late-'80s Oldsmobile,  witnesses said.  </P> <P> Police found the car a block away and learned that its owner had reported it  stolen in Los Angeles earlier in the day. Police searched the area around the  store in patrol cars and helicopters but did not find the suspects, Montigo  said.  </P> <P> Lt. Tony Ditzhazy said the robbery was not related to a similar holdup in  Thousand Oaks on April 28, when two men took $100,000 in jewelry at gunpoint  from Best Products in Thousand Oaks.  </P> <P> However, Ditzhazy said police have not ruled out a connection to a May 26  robbery during which five men armed with a handgun took $100,000 in jewelry  from Zales Jewelers in Simi Valley.  </P></p>

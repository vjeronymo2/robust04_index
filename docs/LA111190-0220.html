			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST : SOUTH PASADENA;  </P> <P> NEWSLETTER TO CEASE PUBLICATION  </P> <P> The City Council agreed Wednesday to shut down the production of the city's  newsletter, The South Pasadena Quarterly, after next year's summer issue, but  promised to explore other methods of providing information to residents.  </P> <P> City Manager John Bernardi said the newsletter, which is written by city staff  members, has grown "dry" over the years, with oft-repeated articles and stories  that have lost their timeliness by the time they are published.  </P> <P> Mayor Evelyn Fierro suggested that the quarterly could be replaced by a shorter  monthly newsletter produced by professional journalists hired by the city. The  council said the quarterly newsletter could be revived if no other substitutes  are found by next June.  </P></p>

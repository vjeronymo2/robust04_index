			<p><P> September 3, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DAN QUAYLE  </P> <P> I'm not a big fan of Quayle, but I do feel that Conrad's cartoon (Quayle under  his desk on the phone saying, "Dad, they're calling up the reserves!" Aug. 23)  was repulsive. For many, many years I have read editorial cartoons, liked some,  disliked others, but this is the first one that has turned my stomach.  </P> <P> ROBERT F.

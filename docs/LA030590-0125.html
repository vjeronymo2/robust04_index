			<p><P> March 5, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> KEATING CUTS HIS SALARY TO $1 IN BANKRUPTCY  </P> <P> Developer Charles H. Keating Jr., head of the bankrupt American Continental  Corp. and the subject of numerous lawsuits and criminal probes, has cut his  salary to $1 a year, the Arizona Republic reported today.  </P> <P> Records filed last week in the company's Chapter 11 bankruptcy case showed that  Keating carried through with a promise made last year to reduce his $400,000  annual salary to a token $1, the newspaper said.  </P> <P> Keating had claimed in a national television broadcast in January that he and  his family were "flat broke." He said his family had been ruined, in part,  because of heavy investments in the company.  </P> <P> Federal officials and investors in American Continental have filed fraud and  racketeering suits totaling more than $1.3 billion against Keating and other  American Continental officials.  </P> <P> Keating and other company officers reduced their salaries at the request of the  committee of unsecured creditors in the American Continental bankruptcy.  </P> <P> Along with Keating's pay cut, the bankruptcy records also showed that Keating's  son, Charles H. Keating III, and his son-in-law, Robert Hubbard Jr., have been  taken off the payroll. The younger Keating, an executive vice president, and  Butler, a vice president, both had been receiving $250,000 annually as of last  April.  </P> <P> The Republic said federal investigators are trying to determine if Charles  Keating Jr. and other company executives may be drawing salaries from at least  eight American Continental subsidiaries that are not covered by the bankruptcy  proceedings.  </P> <P> Ronald Warnicke, a court-appointed examiner in the bankruptcy case, was  expected to submit a report about the finances of the subsidiaries March 21 to  U.S. District Judge Richard Bilby.  </P></p>

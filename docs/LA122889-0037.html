			<p><P> December 28, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: ART  </P> <P> Sly Sues: Sylvester Stallone has sued an art broker for $5 million, claiming  she led him to pay millions of dollars more than he should have for several  artworks. The fraud and breach-of-contract suit, filed Tuesday in Los Angeles  Superior Court, charges that New York-based art consultant Barbara Guggenheim  persuaded Stallone to pay $1.8 million for a painting she told him was an  excellent investment. After buying it sight unseen, the star of the "Rocky" and  "Rambo" movies said he discovered that it was damaged, 25% to 30% of it had  been restored or retouched and that its previous owner had tried for some time  to sell it. The suit also charges that Stallone believes he paid too much for  several other works bought through Guggenheim. CLAUDIA PUIG  </P></p>

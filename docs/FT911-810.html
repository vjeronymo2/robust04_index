			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / Indian parties fear prospect of hung parliament INDIAN politicians increasingly accept that the formation of a new government after the election could be a difficult and protracted affair. India needs to get a new government into place as rapidly as possible after polling, which takes place from May 20-26, to prepare a new budget and negotiate an estimated Dollars 5bn loan from the International Monetary Fund. The postponement of the budget in February resulted in a sharp drop in India's creditworthiness abroad and the risk of a default on its debt. However, all political parties now accept that the election is likely to result in a hung parliament with no party obtaining an absolute majority. The two significant trends to have emerged so far in the campaign are that the Hindu radical BJP party is gaining ground in the north while the Congress party is slipping. The Janata Dal party of the former prime minister, Mr V P Singh, has dropped badly behind - though the regional partners in his National Front coalition and the Marxist parties with which he is allied are helping to bolster his strength. A further trend that has emerged is the widespread disenchantment with political parties. More than 30 per cent of a recent sample survey in the north said they did not know how they would vote or that they would abstain. According to unofficial forecasts here, Mr Rajiv Gandhi's Congress party could obtain about 220 seats of the 520 contested. This is more than the 197 seats Congress won in the present parliament, but below the 270 many in the party hoped for at the beginning of the campaign. If present trends continue the Congress score could fall lower. With 220 seats, Congress would need to join forces with the Marxists or factions within the National Front in a coalition whose main area of agreement would be to deny power to the Hindu nationalists. The Marxists, led by Mr Jyoti Basu, the chief minister of West Bengal, have said that they could not accept the conditions that would accompany a substantial IMF borrowing. All other parties accept the principle that India has no alternative but to borrow. If the Congress score fell below 200 then Mr Gandhi's own future would be in doubt. Mr Chandra Shekhar, the prime minister, and a former leader of both the Congress and the Janata Dal, clearly hopes that in such a situation he would be able to achieve a political realignment and his own reappointment. Much hinges on the performance in the final stages of the campaign of the BJP. The party reckons it can win about 140 seats. However, its standing in the opinion polls could frighten floating Moslem voters into the arms of the Congress.</p>

			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: Permanent interest-bearing shares Prices of permanent interest-bearing shares have not differed substantially since the table was published on April 16. But movement has not been uniform, with most prices weakening, some improving and others static, writes Scheherazade Daneshkhu. Pibs are issued by building societies to raise capital; they pay a fixed income indefinitely but, since they have no redemption date, investors can get back their capital only by selling them in the stock market. There was excitement in the Pibs market when the proposed takeover of Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester by Lloyds bank was announced last month and, soon after, by the news that North of England would merge with Northern Rock. Those holding C&amp;G Pibs on or before March 31 1994 will be entitled to Pounds 500 (if they are a voting member) as well as 10 per cent of their holding, to a maximum of Pounds 10,000, when the takeover is completed. North of England has not announced a similar benefit for its clients but there has much speculative buying of Pibs issues from societies considered likely takeover candidates. These include the Newcastle, Cheshire, Bristol &amp; West, and the Leeds Permanent. David Barker, director of Hoare Govett, says: 'Activity levels have picked up substantially in recent weeks and the market generally has strongly outperformed the gilt-edged market, which has been quite weak over the past month. 'The reasons are twofold - investors believe the high real yields offered by Pibs are attractive in a low-inflation environment, and many investors were lucky enough to own Pibs issued by C&amp;G and North of England. Both Pibs saw strong gains.'  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                  PERMANENT INTEREST-BEARING SHARES  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Stock                 Coupon  Minimum  Issue    Issue  Price*  Yield*                       (gross  (pounds)  date    price (pence) (gross,                         %)                     (pence)            %)  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Birmingham Midshires   9.38    1,000  16/12/93  100.17   91.50  10.25 Bradford &amp; Bingley    13.00   10,000   30/9/91  100.20  128.50  10.12 Bradford &amp; Bingley    11.63   10,000   29/6/92  100.13  117.00   9.94 Bristol &amp; West        13.38    1,000  11/12/91  101.79  126.00  10.62 Bristol &amp; West        13.38    1,000  31/10/91  100.34  126.00  10.62 Britannia (1st)       13.00    1,000   13/1/92  100.42  125.75  10.34 Britannia (2nd)       13.00    1,000   8/10/92  107.13  125.75  10.34 Cheltenham &amp; Gloucs   11.75   50,000  21/10/92  100.96  119.50   9.83 Coventry**            12.13    1,000   28/5/92  100.75  115.75  10.48 First National        11.75   10,000    4/5/93  100.25  103.50  11.35 Halifax               12.00   50,000   23/1/92  100.28  122.75   9.76 Halifax                8.75   50,000    7/9/93  100.62   91.50   9.56 Leeds Permanent       13.63   50,000    3/6/91  100.00  135.25  10.07 Leeds &amp; Holbeck       13.38    1,000   31/3/92  100.23  125.25  10.68 Newcastle             12.63    1,000    8/9/92  100.45  116.75  10.81 Newcastle             10.75    1,000   15/6/93  100.32  101.63  10.58 North of England      12.63    1,000   23/6/92  100.14  119.50  10.56 Skipton               12.88    1,000   27/2/92  100.48  120.25  10.71  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Hoare Govett. *Purchase price as at opening May 19; excludes accrued interest **includes stamp duty payable on Coventry pibs only  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

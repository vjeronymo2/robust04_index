			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / Business and the Law: Limits on postal monopoly - European Court Legal monopolies given exclusive rights by national laws will be open to competition in areas which do not threaten their core traditional business or their economic viability following a ruling by the European Court of Justice last week. The court clarified the position of legal monopolies under EC competition law in a case involving the Belgian postal service. It said that a business which held a dominant position because it was granted exclusive rights under national law did not automatically breach EC competition rules. Member states, however, were under a duty not to adopt or maintain measures which weakened EC competition rules. In the context of businesses entrusted with services of general economic interest, EC competition rules still apply so long as they do not interfere with the provision of such services. Belgium's postal monopoly law gave exclusive right to the Belgian postal authority to collect, transport and deliver post in Belgium. Criminal proceedings were brought against a Mr Corbeau for providing a service in Liege. The Liege court sought guidance from the European Court on the compatibility of the postal monopoly with the Rome treaty's prohibition of abuse of a dominant position and the rules dealing with the application of competition law to the public sector. The court ruled that the core service provided by the postal authority was a service of general economic interest and thus EC competition rules would not apply to the extent necessary for the achievement of the core postal service. However, it was necessary to establish to what extent the competition rules must be excluded for that purpose of general economic interest to be achieved. Because the Belgian postal monopoly needed to remain economically viable - by cross-subsidising unprofitable with profitable sectors - it was justifiable to prevent outside competition from those who only sought to provide a competing service in profitable sectors of the market. Competition could be permitted when competing services were specific, such as meeting particular requirements and therefore distinguishable from the core postal service. Supplementary or improved services, such as home collection or greater reliability within limited areas, would not threaten the economic viability of the service. Nevertheless the ECJ left it to the national court to apply these criteria to the particular facts. C-320/91: Paul Corbeau, ECJ FC, 19 May 1993. Spanish aid decision overturned William Cook, a UK steel castings group, has won its appeal against the European Commission's rejection of a complaint about state aid granted to a Spanish competitor. The Spanish government granted a subsidy to Piezas y Rodajes SA for a foundry investment programme in Teruel province. Further subsidies were granted by various local authorities. William Cook complained to the Commission that the additional aid was unlawful. The court declared the appeal admissible as William Cook was a party concerned by the procedure which the Commission should have initiated, even though the Commission denied there were any big distortions of competition resulting from the contested aid. The court repeated its definition of parties concerned in this context as persons, undertakings or associations whose interests might be affected by the provision of the aid. The court overturned the Commission decision because it had not initiated the procedure provided for by the treaty when it had difficulties in assessing the compatibility of aid. The court said the Commission may restrict itself to a preliminary examination when taking a decision to allow aid, only if it can satisfy itself from this that the aid is compatible. Otherwise, it is duty bound to obtain all opinions and initiate the full procedure. C-198/91: William Cook Plc v Commission, ECJ FC, 19 May 1993. BRICK COURT CHAMBERS, BRUSSELS</p>

			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / International Company News: Price fall hits Siam Cement figures A 15 per cent fall in domestic wholesale cement prices has hurt profits at Siam Cement, Thailand's largest conglomerate and building materials supplier. Unconsolidated third-quarter net earnings slid 28 per cent to Bt694m (Dollars 27m). Net profits for the first nine months were 38 per cent lower at Bt2.22bn. Many stockbrokers now think full-year consolidated earnings will dip to Bt3bn from 1992's Bt3.98bn. Mr Hayden Meadows, of Baring Research in Bangkok, said the company's aggressive depreciation policy - capital values over five years - along with heavy interest charges distorted the figures. 'Operational results have been better than expected because the demand for cement has picked up,' he said. Two-thirds of Siam Cement's revenue comes from cement and construction material sales. Good returns from steel and machinery and electricals subsidiaries boosted Siam Cement's consolidated third-quarter earnings by 2 per cent to Bt1.03bn from Bt1.011bn. The nine-month consolidated profit was down 29 per cent to Bt2.58bn. Siam City Cement, Thailand's second-largest cement company, reported consolidated net earnings for the first time at Bt364m, a 2 per cent rise over last year's parent company only figures. Nine-month consolidated profits were Bt1.38bn. Analysts are forecasting full-year earnings of Bt1.6bn, compared with Bt1.24bn in 1992.</p>

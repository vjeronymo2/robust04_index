			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / Britannia to shed jobs and buy aircraft BRITANNIA Airways, Britain's biggest charter airline, is to spend Pounds 250m on new aircraft and shed 560 jobs in an efficiency drive. The aircraft order includes a Pounds 40m engine contract with Rolls-Royce. Britannia, subsidiary of Thomson Holidays, Britain's biggest package tour operator, will cut 290 jobs in its engineering division and 160 pilots. Mr Roger Burnell, managing director of Britannia, said some compulsory redundancies would be inevitable. The cuts come largely because the company's new fleet will consist of fewer, larger aircraft. Mr Burnell said: 'By summer 1994 we will have 29 aircraft compared with 38 in summer 1992. The new aircraft will need less maintenance, so we will need fewer pilots and engineers.' Pilots will spend more time flying as a result of a new rostering system and changes to employment contracts. Extra cabin crew will be taken on. Britannia, based in Luton, Bedfordshire, is buying five new Boeing 757s from Boeing in a deal worth Dollars 275m (Pounds 181m). Another two will come from Los Angeles based International Lease Finance Corporation. Each 757 will carry up to 235 passengers in an all-economy seating configuration. By the summer of 1994, Britannia's fleet will consist entirely of Boeing 757s and the larger, wide-bodied 767s. Both models are capable of flying across the Atlantic, unlike the shorter-range 737s. Mr Burnell said the fleet modernisation would increase the capacity of the airline by about 5 per cent, even though fewer aircraft would be operated. He said the holiday industry had been little affected by the economic recession. Britannia's sales last year amounted to about Pounds 550m, 14 per cent higher than in 1991. Sales this year would be about the same as last year. Britannia also announced yesterday that its ground handling operation at Luton would be taken over by Serviceair. About 35 research jobs in Dorset will be reprieved in a review of government plans for cutting more than 2,000 staff at the restructured Defence Research Agency. Closure plans for 15 sites were confirmed in a written Commons reply by Mr Jonathan Aitken, defence procurement minister. The cuts, which involve abandoning almost a third of the DRA's sites, are aimed at saving Pounds 90m a year.</p>

			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Management: Personnel values - Does the human resource department have a future? If the late spaghetti western producer Sergio Leone had made a feature film about personnel management - and the likelihood of that was about as remote as the planet Pluto - he would probably have billed it The Job With No Name. Its sheer fuzziness and lack of hard performance measures are a constant source of frustration in management circles, as well as provoking suspicions among employees and scepticism among academics. The Trades Union Congress, for instance, recently wrestled with the meaning of human resource management - as personnel is sometimes called - describing it as a 'slippery concept' and questioning the motive behind some HRM practices. The formation earlier this year of the Institute of Personnel and Development - the professional body combining the old Institute of Personnel Management and the Institute of Training and Development - came at a time when some companies were dispensing with their personnel departments completely, choosing to assign the responsibility to line managers. Indeed at this week's annual conference of the IPD in Harrogate, which finishes today, Sir Brian Pitman, the chief executive of Lloyds Bank, told delegates that removing the central personnel department at Lloyds was one of the most effective changes the bank had made. He said: 'Line managers now understand the pains of some of the decisions that personnel has to take.' However, in spite of this, there seems a sense among delegates that their time has finally come. Mike Bett, the IPD president, summed it up by pointing to a growing recognition that the survival and success of organisations will increasingly depend on their ability to build highly skilled workforces and to release the full potential of employees. 'There should be a professional personnel and development specialist on all top management teams: in the boardroom and on the executive committees,' he suggested, adding that personnel should be involved in developing front-line boardroom strategy. Bett's confidence in a rosy future, however, is not universally shared. Earlier in the year a team headed by David Metcalf at the London School of Economics described personnel specialists as 'big hat, no cattle' with lots of pretentions and few results. Its research suggested that the presence of a personnel manager was associated with poorer employee relations. Drawing from the same body of research as that used by the LSE team - the third Workplace Industrial Relations Survey - but taking a different definition of personnel, David Guest, of Birkbeck College in London, and Kim Hoque, a researcher at the LSE, presented a more positive picture. Their study concluded that HRM was producing superior performances in the workplace. The contribution of personnel specialists, said Guest and Hoque, had been difficult to identify because they often worked by exercising influence in partnership with line managers. This sometimes created ambiguity about personnel responsibilities so that when things went wrong it proved expedient to blame the personnel specialist. Personnel's influence on strategy is equally a subject of debate and contradictory research. Guest and Hoque quote earlier research which suggests that personnel departments often have insufficient responsibility to influence human resource strategy. They noted another study, however, by Cranfield School of Management and Price Waterhouse International, which found that 43 per cent of personnel directors claim to be involved in the formulation of corporate strategy from the outset. The IPD's response to personnel's uncertain role has been to place a strong emphasis on sifting good practice from bad in an effort to position itself in Bett's words, as 'the pre-eminent professional body influencing and improving the quality, thinking and practice of people management and development'. On the one hand the IPD is promising to extend training and support for often hard-pressed personnel professionals, on the other it is wedging open the door, making itself accessible as a consultancy service and provider of books, reports, seminars and conferences. Conscious of the jargon, Geoff Armstrong, the IPD's director general, has also committed the institute to encouraging greater clarity of the personnel role. 'By removing jargon and barriers to understanding, we must spread the message that the development and management of people is much more than a series of fashionable programmes,' he said shortly after the formation of the institute. He believes personnel is 'a systematically learnable discipline, with a wide range of explicit competencies which need to be applied appropriately by everyone who has responsibility for other people'. The IPD has warned against what Armstrong calls the promotion by gurus of 'the wonders of human resource management' at the expense of collectivism, industrial relations and some personnel procedures. 'Performance management, single status and individually tailored payment packages are presented as the new snake oil which can achieve miracles anywhere', he says. 'Such dogma is misleading and dangerous. 'Useful tools have been packaged up under the banner of human resource management and sold as panaceas, to be applied at any time and place. Without proper regard for the organisation's established culture and particular needs, most such flavours of the month prove deeply disappointing.' The role of the personnel officer or manager, argues Armstrong, is to apply new practices where they are helpful and where they can be adapted to the specific needs of organisations. 'We have seen recently the immense problems which arise when performance-related pay, decentralised bargaining and commercial imperatives are imposed as though they, in isolation, can provide all the answers in our schools and hospitals,' he said. He is distancing the IPD from the concept that HRM should be used as an exploitative tool of management. What lessons can be drawn from human resource management? Will it be a distinct learnable discipline at the cutting edge of organisational and employee development in the 21st century or will it fade away, remembered only as a brave attempt to bag up an elusive set of ideas? The challenge for personnel is to maintain its separate identity in the shifting emphasis within rapidly changing organisations. Leading that shift could ensure that it has a bright future.</p>

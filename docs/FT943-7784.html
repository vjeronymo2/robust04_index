			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / Sport: Time to cash in the goal futures - Football / Peter Berlin asks economists about transfer fees' logic This afternoon the big spenders of the English Premier League briefly put their cheque books away and pull their boots on for the first match of the new season. The summer brought the usual riotous behaviour in the transfer bazaar. Blackburn Rovers broke the British record when they bought Chris Sutton from Norwich City. Sutton should play at Southampton today giving fans a chance to assess where balance sheet and team sheet meet. But what do economists make of the transfer market? Kenny Dalglish, Blackburn's manager, paid Pounds 5m to Norwich City for Sutton, a converted centre-half. He has played just one season at forward and scored 35 league goals. A few weeks later Tottenham Hotspur paid Pounds 2m, 40 per cent of the Sutton price, for German striker Jurgen Klinsmann. Sutton's salary is between Pounds 12,000 and Pounds 15,000 a week, plus bonuses. Klinsmann is reported to be earning at least Pounds 15,000 a week. Sutton has not played for England; Klinsmann has played more than 60 games for Germany, has scored eight goals in the last two World Cups and collected a winners medal in 1990. Spurs paid for Klinsmann by selling Vinny Samways, a limited mid-field playmaker, to Everton for Pounds 2.2m. Does this make financial sense? Dr Stefan Szymanski, lecturer in economics at Imperial College management school says football has an unusually efficient labour market. 'When you hire executives, you have very little opportunity to observe them working on a day-to-day basis and see the effort they put in,' says Szymanski. 'In the executive labour market there is very little correlation between pay and performance. 'But every week 20,000 people see players work. The price they attract is a pretty good reflection of the contribution they make. Players who command high salaries are recognised as great players.' The evidence, says Szymanski, is that spending money works. Clubs can buy success. 'Position in the league is related to expenditure on wages and transfers: 88 per cent of variation in position in the league is explained by expenditure.' 'Of course you can make mistakes,' says Szymanski. 'Managers lose money when they think they can beat the market, when they think they can spot a bargain. When you spend intelligently you will do well. Dalglish was not taking a risk when he bought Shearer (for Pounds 3.3m in 1992). He should win the league on the basis of expenditure.' There are other considerations, too. Age for example: Sutton is 21, Klinsmann is 30. 'You have to say age comes into it,' says Dan Corry, senior economist at the Institute of Public Policy Research. 'Turnover of players is still quite low,' says Szymanski. 'If all goes reasonably well, you might expect Sutton to stay at Blackburn, whereas Klinsmann's contract is unlikely to be renewed.' Even if Sutton does not stay, he represents a sound investment, says Prof Tom Cannon, of Manchester University and Manchester Business School. Sutton is a goalscorer, like Shearer and is one of the few English players with the potential to interest Italian clubs. If he were to go to Italy near the end of his contract Blackburn could expect to reap a handsome profit. There may be other costs for the clubs, says Kevin Gardner, UK economist at Morgan Stanley. 'The cost of finance to clubs will vary. If you are a quoted company like Tottenham there is an external discipline on you. With Jack Walker (the club's owner) behind Blackburn there are lower implicit financing costs.' When playing in Europe, as Blackburn will be this season, there are limits on the number of non-English players in a side. Buying Klinsmann would have complicated matters for Blackburn, but not for Tottenham, who are not in Europe. Furthermore, Manchester United, the only team to finish above Blackburn last season, have seven non-English first-team regulars. They must buy Englishmen. Dalglish would have known that Sutton was one of the few players United could pursue this summer. Alex Ferguson, manager of Manchester United, had opened the transfer battles by luring David May, an English defender, from Blackburn. Could Dalglish have been aiming to hurt United and his other rivals with his cheque book? For Pounds 5m he has got two players: the one who will play for him and the one who will not play for United. But, says Corry, that works both ways: 'Then he could have wasted money twice: if he is useless you have wasted money and United would have had a useless player.' Pushing up the market makes sense, says Corry: 'If you have the cash why not use it? You force the market up for everyone else.' This increases the pressure on other clubs. As Simon Briscoe, economist at Warburg Securities, says: 'Sooner or later there will be a British or European super league. There is a desperate fear among clubs that they will be left out.' Cannon says football is unusual because many of its clubs, notably Blackburn, Manchester United and Newcastle, are highly liquid. He says that since Tottenham's disastrous attempt to diversify in the 1980s, clubs are wary of straying from football. So transfers and wages soak up most of the spare cash and the result is 'hyperinflation in the domestic market and clubs look abroad'. This is not a uniquely English problem. 'The prices move around the world,' says Cannon. Three years ago, he says, the Italian league transfer fees leapt up. Before that it was France, led by Marseilles and before that Spain. The only option for clubs who want to compete with Manchester United and Blackburn is to match their level of spending. 'When you spend enough you should win the league,' says Szymanski. 'In theory you should be able to calculate what it takes to buy the championship.' Football transfers, says Szymanski, work 'like a perfect capital market. All the information is in the current price. That does not mean bad things, such as injuries, will not happen.' Briscoe disagrees. 'Perfect market theory does not help you understand why Sutton is worth double the next person - there must be some imperfection in the system. You cannot give these players points. Athletics is the exact opposite - it is very clear who is the best in the world and who is the fifth best. 'It is not clear what the secret of success is - and if someone found the secret, football would cease to be interesting.'</p>

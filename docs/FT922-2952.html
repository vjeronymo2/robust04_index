			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / Japanese business confidence slumps HOPES FOR an early recovery of the Japanese economy were dashed yesterday when the Bank of Japan reported that business confidence in May had plunged to the lowest level in five years. The results of the quarterly Tankan, or short-term economic survey, showed an unexpectedly pessimistic outlook and contributed to a decline yesterday on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The Nikkei Average closed down 325.37 points at 17,383,68. The closely-watched index of business conditions for manufacturing industries plunged from minus 5 per cent in February to minus 24 per cent, compared to a forecast in February of minus 12 per cent. Non-manufacturing fell from 17 per cent in February to 1 per cent in May, compared to a forecast of 5 per cent. The Bank of Japan nonetheless said the economy had hit bottom and manufacturers were expecting a modest improvement in the months ahead, with the index rising to minus 20 per cent in September. Manufacturing profits are expected to be down by 4.8 per cent in fiscal 1992, which began in April, after falling 23.4 per cent in 1991. Profits in the first half of the year are projected to be off 22.5 per cent, although the second half of the year will see a 17 per cent rise compared to the same period of 1991. The survey confirmed earlier statistics indicating that the overhang of unsold goods which has depressed the manufacturing sector has not eased. The index of product inventory levels rose from 31 per cent in February to 32 per cent in May, compared to earlier forecasts of a decline to 18 per cent. The Bank of Japan said the survey would not cause it to ease monetary policy further. The official discount rate, at which the central banks lends money to commercial banks, was last reduced by 0.75 per cent to 3.75 per cent in early April. Economists believe the central bank may be forced to reduce interest rates again in the autumn. The Tankan survey showed a continuing modest easing in conditions in the labour market with the index moving from minus 15 per cent in February to minus 7 per cent in May.</p>

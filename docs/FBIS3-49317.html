There are various stories  about it, and the Belgian police is carrying out an intensive  search for a possible murderer. VJESNIK was informed of a series  of details in connection with this crime from reliable  intelligence sources. It can be concluded that Juka Prazina was  the victim of a well-conceived plan made at the Supreme Command  Headquarters of the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Prazina's murder resulted from the fact that this Muslim --  who distinguished himself as one of the organizers of the  defense of Sarajevo during the first days of war in  Bosnia-Herzegovina -- did not accept Izetbegovic's  fundamentalist politics; moreover he and a group of his soldiers  joined the Croatian Defense Council. There were many rumors  about Juka Prazina even while he was alive. People know that he  had his headquarters on the Jahorina Mountain near Sarajevo  during the first days of the war. The name of this mountain was  taken by Juka's murderers as the name of the action of his  assassination.  <H5>  Cover-up of Crime </H5>   The murder was carried out by five members of the "Delta"  unit. It is a unit for special purposes at the Army of  Bosnia-Herzegovina Supreme Command Headquarters. The commander  of the unit is Mr. Ismet Bajramovic, known as Celo, who  personally led the action against Juka Prazina. The money for  the logistical support was provided by Bakir Izetbegovic, the  son of Alija Izetbegovic, who has been out of Sarajevo for six  months already. He often travels between Brussels, Paris,  Frankfurt, Baghdad, Teheran and Ankara using Pakistani and Iraqi  passports.    The "Delta" unit consists of 270 persons, the majority of  whom come from Sandzak. They were selected by Mr. Ejup Ganic  personally. For some time "Delta" was under the direct command  of Mr. Sefer Halilovic, the former commander in chief of the  Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Recently it has been noticed that  the "Delta" has been performing its actions together with the  "Laste" unit. The latter is the sabotage unit of the Ministry  of Internal Affairs of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Its commander is Mr.  Bakir Alispahic, the minister of internal affairs of  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    It is worth mentioning that some actions of the "Delta" and  "Laste" units were performed in cooperation with some sections  of the later dissolved 10th Mountain Brigade of the Army of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, as for example the action in the village of  Grbavica, close to Kojic, in which 28 Croats were brutally  killed. The commander of this action was the notorious Zulfikar  Alispaga, called Zuk. Mustafa Topalovic-Caco, the commander of  the 10th Mountain Brigade at that time, also participated in the  action.    Several months later Caco was killed in one of the internal  clashes among members of the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina in  Sarajevo. This was explained to the public as an action  organized by the military and civilian authorities of  Bosnia-Herzegovina against war profiteers, but it was  established later on that the persons removed were witnesses of  the crimes committed in Grbavica. Nine soldiers of the 10th  Mountain Brigade who, together with Caco, participated in the  massacre of innocent Croats were killed, too.  <H5>  "Logistics Expert" Fled to Khartoum </H5>   The information that reached VJESNIK from intelligence  services claim that the notorious Hasan Cengic is involved in  the murder of Juka Prazina. He is the man whose name was  mentioned in connection with the scandal that broke out at  Maribor Airport after smuggled weapons had been discovered.  There is evidence that he fled from Slovenia via Vienna to  Khartoum after large quantities of weapons had been revealed.    In the government of Bosnia-Herzegovina Hasan Cengic  performs  the function of head of logistics for the Army of  Bosnia-Herzegovina. Many foreign analysts think that he,  together with Rusmir Muhmudcehaic, is the man who has the  biggest political influence on Alija Izetbegovic, who was long  ago his prison companion in Zenica.    The "Jahorina" action was already planned in October 1993,  and Juka Prazina's travels around Europe were followed by three  "Laste" members and three Palestinians, members of the  pro-Syrian Al Saqe group. The cooperation between the "Laste"  and this Palestinian group dates back to the time when the  unsuccessful "Efendija" action, in which Fikret Abdic was to  have been murdered, was carried out. VJESNIK wrote about this  action in detail, Abdic also spoke about it in an interview  given to a Croatian daily.    When the commanders of the "Jahorina" action realized that  Juka Prazina would stay in Belgium for a longer period of time,  Ismet Bajramovic-Celo gave the sign for the final stage of the  plan to start. Bakir Izetbegovic and Hasan Cengic, who arrived  in Belgium for this purpose with a Pakistani passport, supplied  the five members of the "Delta" unit with weapons, rented cars  and false documents. Two "Saab" cars and a "Peugeot" were used  in the action. According to information that reached VJESNIK  from intelligence sources, some of these details are already  known to the Belgian police.  <H5>  Hit Lists </H5>   One of the Al Saqe members who followed Juka Prazina made an  appointment with him at a highway car park, after introducing  himself as a weapons dealer. The assassins waited for Prazina,  who came to the meeting in a "Golf." When he got out of the  car, he was shot dead by the assassins. His body was left in a  canal close to the highway, and his car was removed to avoid the  attention of other drivers and the police. That is why  Prazina's body was only discovered by pure coincidence 10 days  after the murder.    The following day the assassins left for Khartoum via  Brussels, Paris, and Cairo. Bakir Izetbegovic returned to  Baghdad, and Hasan Cengic flew to Islamabad with a false  Pakistani passport. The three members of the "Laste" unit left  for Frankfurt the day before the assassination took place, and  the Palestinians from the Al Saqe group are probably still in  Belgium.    Reliable sources claim that the "Jahorina" action is yet  another of the actions planned by the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina  Supreme Command against those Muslims who do not accept Alija  Izetbegovic's politics. According to well-informed sources, a  large number of respected Muslim intellectuals who live in  Croatia and Europe are on the list of persons to be removed.</p>

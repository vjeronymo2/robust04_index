			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / Chance to avert currency crisis 'missed': Italian central banker claims Bonn and Rome proposed general currency alignment last month THE crisis on European foreign exchanges could have been avoided if EC members had accepted a German-Italian proposal for a general currency realignment last month, according to Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, governor of the Bank of Italy. Mr Ciampi's comments, in an interview with the Financial Times, seem likely to spark fresh controversy over the circumstances surrounding the lira's devaluation on the weekend of September 12/13. In particular, the statement may raise questions about Britain's refusal to devalue sterling that weekend. The line was upheld by Mr Norman Lamont, UK chancellor of the exchequer, at a secret 7.30am meeting at the Treasury with his top monetary officials on Sunday, September 13. Three days later, on 'Black Wednesday' - September 16 - Britain was forced to suspend its membership of the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) after heavy international selling forced sterling below its D-Mark floor. Mr Ciampi made clear that he was not directing his remarks against any particular EC member. But he implied that Britain, as well as other weaker currency countries, should have joined in the Italian devaluation a month ago, as a means of defusing tension in the ERM. He suggested that, if other countries had devalued along with the lira, the Bundesbank would have increased the scale of its interest rate cuts  - decided in principle on Saturday, September 12 and publicly announced after a meeting of the Bundesbank council on September 14. 'The crisis which emerged last month could have been avoided if the member states had grasped the opportunity provided by the German and Italian proposal of September 12 for a general realignment, within the bounds set by an appreciation of the D-Mark and an equal depreciation of the lira, coupled with a decrease in interest rates in Germany,' Mr Ciampi said. 'Unfortunately, the realignment was limited to the lira/D-Mark exchange rate, so that the accompanying reduction in German rates was only small. This left plenty of scope for the market to mount further speculative attacks against other currencies.' The British government has denied receiving a request to join in any devaluation as part of the ERM realignment deal worked out by Italy and Germany. British officials reject the view that an Italian-German 'proposal' for a wider realignment was on offer that weekend. However, it has emerged that, during the September 13 meeting at the UK Treasury, British officials briefly broached the possibility that sterling could join in the Italian devaluation. The issue was raised at the meeting by Sir Terry Burns, permanent secretary at the Treasury, as an option, according to UK officials. Any likelihood that sterling would follow the lira by devaluing was, however, immediately scotched by Mr Lamont. The Treasury meeting came about 12 hours after the British government had first heard of the Italian-German plan, in a series of telephone calls from the continent. Mr Ciampi felt this was probably not the best way to persuade other ERM members of the merits of a general realignment. UK officials say the lira devaluation, including the accompanying Bundesbank interest rate cuts, was presented as a fait accompli on Saturday evening. Significantly, details of the Bundesbank's cuts - a 1/4 point reduction in the Lombard rate, and  1/2 point declines in the Bundesbank's discount rate and the key money market dealing rate - were communicated to Britain and other EC partners that evening. The interest rate moves were not formally decided by the Bundesbank council until the morning of September 14. One senior UK official said the Italian-German deal was 'stitched up before anyone else was given information about it'. Monday Interview, Page 30</p>

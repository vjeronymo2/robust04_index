			<p><P> April 7, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VERNAL EQUINOX  </P> <P> As I drove down Magnolia Boulevard in Sherman Oaks the other day, I observed a  very comforting sight even though it nearly blinded me. The time was 6:03 p.m.  and I was driving due west as the sun was just sinking below the horizon.  </P> <P> The awe I felt was in part due to the recognition of the event that I observed.  It was nature proclaiming the Vernal Equinox as it has recurred for the  umpteenth time with precision and beauty.  </P> <P> In the scheme of things, this event appeared to have gone unnoticed. I did not  see it noted in newspaper editorials or in TV or radio commentary, but in this  world of ours with its arbitrary standards and relative criteria there is a  certain joy to behold in the simple truths of nature. It is an event that  demonstrates order in an often chaotic surrounding. It is a discovery that  belongs to children, or perhaps the child within us.  </P> <P> ALLEN HANS  </P> <P> Van Nuys  </P></p>

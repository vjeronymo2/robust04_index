			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / Free-marketeer enters interventionist ranks: But help does not mean handouts, Tim Eggar tells David Lascelles Mr Tim Eggar has become an unlikely flag-waver for the cause of intervention in business. The trade and industry minister has had his brief at the department widened recently to include industrial matters. As energy minister, he made a point of pursuing free-market policies whenever possible. Mr Eggar took over the responsibilities of Mr Tim Sainsbury, the industry minister who left in the midsummer reshuffle. Mr Eggar, formerly identified with the more free-market wing of the Tory party, is keen to stress the positive role that government can play in helping business to become more effective in the international marketplace. He said: 'The government has to play a role if private-sector companies are going to be able to compete. People who think that the government should just stand around and let the private sector 'win' are not in the real world. No other country that we compete with takes that view.' But Mr Eggar is also careful to define the kind of intervention he has in mind. There will be 'no state direction or state handouts'. His aim is to help create an international competitive business environment. 'I see myself working with industrial sectors in partnership.' He cited as an example last week's council of industry ministers in Brussels. One of the issues discussed was the biotechnology industry where, in Mr Eggar's view, EU directives have hindered companies' ability to compete. 'We have to reduce that.' Another issue was steel. Mr Eggar was the only minister at the meeting representing a government without a shareholding in a national steel company. He said: 'Does that mean we have no interest in steel? Actually, because we have a successful private-sector steel industry, we need to work even more to ensure that other countries don't squeeze it.' Mr Eggar intends to analyse all the main industrial sectors over the next couple of months to identify their strengths and weaknesses, and then discuss with them what the government should do. He added: 'We will work out a joint programme of action that is appropriate. We are not imposing anything. We want industry to have ownership.' He has already met representatives from the footwear industry where, he believes, the government can act as an honest broker to improve links between equipment suppliers, manufacturers and customers. 'They talk more bluntly to us than to each other. That means we can play a facilitating role.' Because of this, Mr Eggar believes that the sectors that could benefit most from more contact with government are those which have so far had the least contact. He cites the process plant industry as an example. He wants to persuade the European Commission to concentrate more directly on the competitiveness aspect of its policies and regulations. 'Everything they do should have a Euro-competitiveness impact statement. We face a very severe threat to our standard of living.' One of his particular aims is to advance the liberalisation of the European energy market where proposals for free trade of electricity and gas across borders have been stalled for several years. Although Mr Eggar sees his approach going more deeply into industrial sectors than before, he stresses that it still conforms to the policy of Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade secretary, of raising competitiveness - as evidenced by the DTI's white paper on the subject earlier this year. Mr Charles Wardle, the new junior minister, will handle some energy matters but Mr Eggar will continue to be responsible for the main policy issues in the energy sector. Over the coming months he must settle the sale of British Coal and the deregulation of the domestic gas market, and decide what to do about the nuclear power industry. He also has responsibility for the privatisation of the Post Office.</p>

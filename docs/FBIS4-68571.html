			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report by Kheber-Servis: "Declaration by Political </F> Organizations"]    [Text] Six political parties in the  republic -- the Azerbaijan People's Front, the ADP [Azerbaijan  Democratic Party], Musavat, Yurddash, the People's Democratic  Party, and the Independent Democratic Party -- have disseminated  a joint declaration. The reason for issuing the declaration was  the arrest on 19 February of opposition representatives in  Khachmaz Rayon. In the document it states that the arrest for  political motives of members of opposition organizations in  Baku, Nakhchyvan, Beylegan, Goranboy and now Khachmaz, and  illegal actions against people's representatives proves the  strengthening of the reactionary regime in Azerbaijan. The  government is trying to exclude opposition forces from the  country's political life.    In the declaration it notes that official circles within the  government are blatantly violating human rights. The opposition  parties are demanding to put an end to the imprisonments and set  the political prisoners free.</p>

			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / Russia's 'economic calm' set to end: Pressures are building that political will alone cannot withstand The second half of the year is always the worst for the Russian economy, says Mr Boris Fyodorov who, as former deputy prime minister for finance, should know. It is the time when the lobbies step up their demands and all the signs are that the period of calm is coming to an end. At root, the problem is simple: sharply rising demands on spending, especially from the military and agriculture, sharply falling tax revenue and very high real interest rates. They add up to pressures that political will alone can probably no longer withstand. 'The situation is not sustainable,' says Professor Charles Wyplosz of France's Insead business school, an expert on the Russian economy. 'Something has to give.' An impasse, though perilous, does not necessarily mean disaster, western experts and Russian economists say. Perversely, it may point to Russia becoming 'normal'. Not in the sense of an advanced market economy for which the Russian reformist governments were striving, but of a politically and economically precarious developing country. 'Russia is now likely entering the so-called Romanian or Latin American way  -with periods of high inflation and attempts at financial stabilisation following each other,' says Mr Andrei Illarionov, deputy head of the Economic Reform Centre. 'We could see a market emerging which is rather monopolistic with huge government intervention, massive state regulation, depressed and fragmentary market competition, highly protectionist economic policy, very efficient production and high prices. We already have an example - Moscow's real estate market - heavily regulated, protected and corrupt.' The implicitly comforting message in this, that Russia can 'muddle through' peacefully if bumpily, is increasingly believed in Russia and elsewhere. But not by all, especially not by Professor Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard University, the highest profile former adviser to the Russian government, who gave a passionate address to a conference of reformers and experts in Stockholm last week. 'This is a country with 2.1m men under arms; it has 30,000 nuclear weapons. We can't afford to sit and wait for it all to go wrong,' he says. It could indeed go wrong, poised as it is on the knife edge of a 'slow reform' which many economists thought (and still think) impossible. Some things are going right: inflation is down from nearly 30 per cent a month at the end of last year to around 8 per cent last month; very high real interest rates are keeping credit tight; and credits which once flowed freely to the other former Soviet republics are largely stopped. 'The end of the rouble zone last autumn is one of the main reasons for the drop in inflation,' argues Ms Brigitte Granville, senior research fellow at the Royal Institute of International Affairs and a Moscow resident. However, the costs of these and other policies are growing fast. The budget for 1994, still being tossed about between the two houses of parliament and the government, is way out of line. Mr Illarionov reckons that, in the first three months of this year, less than half of budget revenues were collected. Mr Wyplosz's figures (see graph) are less dramatic, but still show a serious shortfall in the first quarter. Industrial production has plunged to little more than half its early 1992 level, and, though that misses out the private sector, it still means a disaster for the dominant state economy: closed plants, idle workers, regional and city budgets starved of revenue. The industrial directors, as usual, blame the government. Mr Vladimir Shcherbakov, head of the Interprivitizatsia industrial investment fund (and a former Soviet first deputy premier) says that without urgent action, the government and society are at risk. 'We know what is happening to companies,' he says. They cannot get credit at the price it is. They have no money, no supplies, no modern management expertise, often no modern technology. They are usually not restructuring: the management has simply withdrawn from activity and waits - for something. 'Most of them are technically bankrupt. In the refinery and the petrochemical sector, most work at 30-40 per cent capacity. And I don't believe, like the prime minister, that this is the bottom of the crisis. I think that in the autumn there will be a further deep fall as these plants which are working part-time close because they lack customers and lack supplies.' This has stimulated the opposition to call for changed policies, though with much less vehemence than in the early part of the reform, when Mr Yegor Gaidar was in charge. Earlier this month, a flurry of decrees came out from government under the prompting of President Boris Yeltsin, aimed at stimulating investment through tax cuts and other measures. Mr Yeltsin has harshly criticised acting finance minister Mr Sergei Dubynin and, by implication, prime minister Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, for inaction, reflecting the tension that exists over the economy. Privatisation, the only active economic reform still being undertaken, has produced a new class of owners. Mr Anatoly Chubais, the deputy prime minister for privatisation, takes pride in the 1m proprietors of the shops and restaurants he has helped conjure into being in the past two years. But entrepreneurs in today's Russia must cope with a lot - huge taxes which must be evaded to exist, contradictory laws and regulations, terrible communications and organised crime working without much hindrance and becoming increasingly violent. Mr Wyplosz says 'there has been a clear shift in Russia from extreme laxity to extreme tightness in monetary policy'. Though this produces 'good' figures for inflation, it means Russia plays a high price: indeed, Mr Wyplosz has constructed a 'misery index' which shows how far production falls for every one percentage point reduction in inflation. Russia, argues Mr Sachs and others, would not be suffering so much had it really instituted shock therapy rather than the appearance of it two years ago: now, stuck in a trough between reform and retreat, it is in the worst of all worlds.</p>

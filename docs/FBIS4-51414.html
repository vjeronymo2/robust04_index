			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Flor Wang] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 26 (CNA) -- Premier Lien Chan will make  a stopover in the United States en route to Central America at  the end of the month, Foreign Affairs Minister Chien Fu said  Thursday [26 May].    Chien made the remarks when answering questions from  legislator Chen Chien-jen at a Legislative Yuan committee  meeting.    The United States has promised to make arrangements for  Lien's stay in the U.S., Chien said, adding that he personally  hopes that bilateral relations between Taipei and Washington  will be further boosted after June 3, when the U.S. has to make  a final decision on whether to renew the most-favored-nation  trade status of Beijing. Washington has been very cautious in  handling matters concerning Taiwan and Mainland China, he noted.    Lien, scheduled to leave Taipei for El Salvador and  Guatemala  on May 30 for an eight-day trip, will attend the inauguration of  newly elected Salvadoran President Armando Calderon Sol on June  1 in San Salvador and begin a four-day visit in Guatemala City  starting June 2.</p>

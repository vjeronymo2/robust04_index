			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Travel industry fears package holiday blow - Airport excise duty The introduction of a new excise duty on passengers departing from UK airports angered airlines and the package travel industry and led to fears that British tourism would be damaged. The chancellor announced that from October 1 next year, air passengers from the UK will be charged Pounds 5 for flights to British and European Union destinations and Pounds 10 to go elsewhere. The only travellers exempted from the tax will be children aged under two travelling free, passengers on aircraft with fewer than 20 seats, transit passengers and those making a return journey on a return ticket within the UK. Sir Michael Bishop, chairman of British Midland, objected to air travellers being singled out. He said: 'Why should road, rail and sea travellers be exempt? This decision makes air travel less competitive against other forms of transport. Britain's airlines form a world-beating industry. They deserve better, as do the millions of business and leisure travellers who now face higher fares.' Sir Colin Marshall, chairman of British Airways, said: 'It will mean higher fares for everyone at a time when UK airlines have been working hard to keep fares down.' The British Tourist Authority said that overseas and domestic travellers were already paying Pounds 2bn in value added tax and customs and excise duty. 'Anything that puts the price of travel up will make us less competitive.' The package-tour industry said their business would be badly affected by the tax. Mr Wesley Pentland, president of the Association of British Travel Agents, said: 'The demand for package holidays is very elastic and experience has shown that a small increase in price can cause a fall in demand three time larger.' Abta said it was relieved, however, that the duty would not take effect until next October. This meant most of next summer's programme would be unaffected. The industry will not have to make a decision on whether to absorb or pass on the cost to travellers until they come to sell holidays for winter 1994-95 and summer 1995. Thomas Cook, the travel agents' chain, said the level of holiday prices in summer 1995 would depend as much on the level of competition in the package holiday industry at that time as on the new tax. The Tour Operators' Study Group, which represents 80 per cent of the package tour operators, said it would be attempting to get the government to withdraw the duty, which, it said, had been introduced without consultation. There was anger too that the duty, to be collected by Customs and Excise, will apparently go into general government coffers and will not be used specifically to improve travel facilities. While the precise form of the duty surprised the travel industry, many were expecting some new form of tax on travel. Some thought the government would introduce value added tax on all domestic travel, but wondered how this would affect the rail privatisation programme. Few believed that value added tax would be imposed on airline fares only. Although Sir Colin and Sir Michael warned against VAT on air travel, Mr Richard Branson, chairman of Virgin Atlantic, conceded the industry should have lobbied harder to avoid a new tax. He said: 'Since the long-haul carriers never even conceived the government would tax tourism we never campaigned to stop it.'</p>

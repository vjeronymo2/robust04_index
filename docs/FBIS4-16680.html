			<p>BFN     [Text] Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev emphasized  the necessity for a comprehensive settlement in Bosnia. "We  cannot keep going from crisis to crisis," he pointed out at a  meeting with journalists today.    "We knew even earlier that Serb words and actions did not  always mean the same. Within the context of the present  situation it is necessary to take steps to diminish rather than  increase this difference," Kozyrev remarked when commenting on  the developments in Bosnia. He said contradictory information  was coming from there which hampered the decision-making.    Kozyrev admitted that Russia had influence on Serbs.  However, he stressed pressure must also be exerted on other  parties, including the Moslems.    Kozyrev suggested that Moslems had considered the NATO air  attacks on the Serb positions as a carte blanche. "They  continue to provoke Serbs and show no interest in an agreement  on settlement of the conflict," Kozyrev said.    Kozyrev believes that the situation must not be simplified  and it was not reasonable to mark everybody as "good and bad  guys" as in a Western. "It is not a Western but an  ethnically-colored civil war with no right no wrong, no angels  no devils," he said.    Kozyrev called on Russia's Western partners to exercise  pressure on Moslems in order to conclude a peace agreement.  Kozyrev confirmed that the Russian position remained the same  stating that any means could be used for defense of the  peacekeeping forces, including the military ones.    "The problem is that there has been no such need in Gorazde.  The further confrontation between Moslems and Serbs and the  blockade of a part of the peacekeeping forces in Bosnia and  Herzegovina were the consequences, not the reason for the NATO  air attacks which had not been coordinated with Russia although  their results could have been predicted," Kozyrev said.    Kozyrev believes that now there are three possible ways of  developing the situation. "The first one is to lose patience  and to resort to air attacks. This will result in a full-scale  war as occurred in Vietnam and Afghanistan. However, in this  case, infantry forces and an expedition corps must be brought to  Bosnia and Herzegovina with an order to kill if necessary.  Otherwise, this will remain vain words. The second option is  to leave Bosnia and Herzegovina completely as it now happens in  Somalia. The third option, the final one, is to try to  negotiate and to proceed to a peace agreement on settlement of  the conflict," Kozyrev clarified.    He said he supported the third option. Kozyrev stressed that  Serbs must be sure that their positive steps would be  appreciated. "These steps must be conditioned with lessening and  later with lifting of the sanctions against Belgrade," he  pointed out.    Kozyrev spoke in favor of giving a real sense to the NATO  program Partnership for Peace.    "They propose us just a flirt but we want a firm marriage in  order to prevent such situations when nobody consults us while  making important decisions, as occurred in Bosnia and  Herzegovina," Kozyrev said.    Asked by Interfax whether it was certain that NATO would not  deal a third strike against the Serbs without consulting Russia,  Kozyrev said is was not reasonable to anticipate the  developments.</p>

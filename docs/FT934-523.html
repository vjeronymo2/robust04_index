			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Rights need safeguarding Sir, Mr Iain Saville (Letters, December 17) misses the point in his reply to Mr J D Whittle (Letters, December 11/12) with regard to the impact of the proposed Crest share settlement system. Most of us would welcome the chance to get rid of all those bits of paper that are processed in the City and at registrars, provided that our rights as shareholders were safeguarded. We are now being asked to surrender these rights or pay extra, and have to keep certificates as well. Crest is protecting the position of redundant registrars and operators of nominee accounts at the expense of private shareholders. Why?

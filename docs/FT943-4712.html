			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / International Company News: Generale de Banque up 8% halfway Generale de Banque, Belgium's biggest bank, yesterday announced net profits 8.6 per cent higher at BFr6.3bn (Dollars 197m) for the first half of 1994. The rise compared with BFr5.8bn in the first six months of last year. However, the 1993 half-year results included an exceptional gain of about BFr2bn, following the sale of shares in ABN Amro, the big Dutch bank. As a result, Generale de Banque said that the improvement in 1994 was significant. Gross profit was BFr21.25 bn, a decline of 7.7 per cent. Analysts interpreted the fall to the failure to repeat the strong capital gains achieved on government bonds in 1993, as well as the exceptional capital gain on the ABN Amro shares. However, write-downs and provisions were down by 31 per cent to BFr8.7bn. Total assets were up 8.8 per cent to BFr3.939bn.</p>

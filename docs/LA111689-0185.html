			<p><P> November 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MACK TRUCKS MUST BORROW AFTER ITS WORST LOSS EVER  </P> <P> Hit by a record $87.5-million loss in the third quarter, Mack Trucks Inc. must  borrow money from Renault and extend its bank loans "to continue as a going  concern," the company says.  </P> <P> Rather than filing for bankruptcy, Mack is seeking additional funds from the  Renault Vehicules Industriels division of the French auto maker, which owns 45%  of Mack's stock, as well as renegotiating credit agreements with its banks.  </P> <P> The third-quarter loss reported Tuesday was the worst in Mack's history, as was  the loss for the first three quarters. The company was in the red $105.9  million for the nine months, contrasted with a profit of $17.9 million for the  same period of last year.  </P></p>

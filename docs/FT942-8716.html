			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / People: Hughes promoted to Mothercare Storehouse is filling the gap left by the departure of Mothercare chief executive Ann Iverson with Simon Hughes, presently logistics director at BHS. Iverson, recruited to Storehouse by former group chief executive David Dworkin, is leaving next month to join Melville, one of the largest diversified retailers in the US, as head of Kay-Bee, Melville's toys division. Hughes, 45, beat other internal as well as external candidates to the post. Storehouse said it felt an internal appointment was appropriate in order to promote stability and continuity in a company which has seen a string of departures by senior executives in recent years. He is already known inside Mothercare, as he is heading a project looking at whether to integrate its distribution chain with that of BHS, which he reorganised. Hughes, a father of two teenage daughters, says his style may be different from that of his predecessor, although the 'open' culture will not change. 'Ann went to Mothercare when it needed to be turned round,' he says. 'I am going when the need is to build on the work that has been done. My job is to get all the parts working together.' Hughes adds that a priority is to ensure the sales staff are 'emotionally involved' in their jobs, and in the Mothercare brand. 'The service and emotion has to be there. That's when the brand comes to life.' Otherwise, his main tasks will be to complete the conversion of the stores to a new design, and overhauling the supply chain. Hughes graduated from London University and worked for British Rail before joining shoe retailers C &amp; J Clark, and then Chaussures Ravel. He joined BHS in 1985 as a merchandise controller and was appointed to the board in 1990. His existing responsibilities will be divided between other BHS directors when he moves to Mothercare.</p>

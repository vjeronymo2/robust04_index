The khaki clad and heavily armed rightists had camped  at the Bophuthatswana Defence Force [BDF] air strip for most of  the day.    Shortly before 4.30pm, there were up to 400 vehicles filled  with the right wingers at the air strip and they finally formed  a long convoy heading towards the South African border and the  Western Transvaal. The rightists were all gone by shrtly before  6pm, according to reports.    The rightists had made it difficult for journalists covering  the crisis in Bophuthatswana to interview them -- or even  approach the BDF air strip. It was not immediately clear what  prompted the final departure -- but there was speculation in  Mmabatho the retreat was prompted by the arrival of SA Defence  Force troops whose task, in conjunction with the Bophuthatswana  Defence Force, is to restore order in the strife-torn territory.    At least three of the invadors were killed execution style  after being ambushed by Bophuhatswana security force members.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Wio Joustra: "Greeks Will Allow No Delays in </F> Succession to Delors"]    [Text] Greece, which is currently assuming the presidency  of the European Union (EU), wants the succession to Jacques  Delors as president of the European Commission (EC) to be  settled at the European summit in Corfu on 24 and 25 June. The  Greeks are not expecting any postponement in the appointment or  a veto from one or more countries against specific candidacies.    Pangalos, Greek minister for European affairs, spoke of  Greece's position in The Hague on Wednesday [15 June], after a  discussion with outgoing Prime Minister Lubbers and other  cabinet members. Pangalos said that "the decision could not be  postponed because of agreements with the European Parliament  (EP), which has to ratify the European Council's choice." He  added that "a long discussion about individuals would be  fruitless and would have a negative effect on public opinion."    Pangalos said nothing about any Greek preference for one of  the candidates. In any case, Greece will not put anyone forward  at Corfu. Pangalos, who is traveling round the EU capitals in  preparation of the EU summit, admitted there was a problem for  the council of government leaders. "We do not know which is the  best choice among three excellent possibilities," he said.    He referred to the candidacies of Lubbers, British European  Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan and Belgian Prime Minister  Jean-Luc Dehaene. Although the latter has not put himself  forward as a candidate, he can count on the support of Bonn and  Paris. In The Hague, Pangalos emphasized the neutrality of the  presidency, which will be taken over by Germany on 1 July. For  now, there is no consensus among members states on who should  succeed Delors. There is little chance that the Christian  Democrats, whose "turn" it now is, will make a choice between  Lubbers and Dehaene before Corfu.    An attempt to mediate at the Benelux level by Martens,  Belgian president of the European People's Party (EPP), seems  doomed to failure at present. The EPP, which gathers together  the European Christian Democrats, will meet in Brussels next  Wednesday. Unless Lubbers or Dehaene withdraws, then the battle  between the Netherlands and Belgian candidates will be decided  at Corfu.    Despite the Greek aversion to any postponement, diplomatic  circles in The Hague are taking real account of this  possibility. In their opinion, postponement would become  virtually inevitable if the Lubbers-Dehaene duel were to end in  a narrow victory for one of them. To avoid loss of face for  either camp, Germany, which will assume the presidency, could  then decide to hold an extra summit in September.    Pangalos said that Greece and the Netherlands agreed that  the  decision of the EC presidency was not linked with "other  international institutions or activities." But it was on  Wednesday that rumors about the European jobs issue increased.    The names of former Netherlands Finance Minister Ruding and  Van Rooy, Netherlands state secretary for economic affairs,  suddenly appeared in the rumor mill. They were said to be  candidates respectively for the secretary general position of  the OECD and the WTO [World Trade Organization], which on 1  January 1995 will take over from GATT.    The rumors are strongly denied in government circles. Ruding  reportedly refuses to give up his job as second in command at  the powerful American Bank Citycorp in New York. Van Rooy, who  was second on the CDA [Christian Democratic Appeal] list of  candidates in the parliamentary elections on 3 May, wants to  deepen her experience in national politics.    The Netherlands supports Lawson, former British chancellor  of  the exchequer, for the OECD position and Mexican President  Salinas for the WTO position. But The Hague is putting forward  a top civil servant for a second-rank position in the WTO:  Engering, director general of the Foreign Economic Relations  Department of the Economic Affairs Ministry.</p>

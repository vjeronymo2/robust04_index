			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / Club Med sails close to the red THE SUMMER holidays have come to an abrupt end for Club Mediterranee, one of France's largest leisure and travel groups. Club Med warned yesterday that the effects of recession and political problems in some of its resorts could cause a pre-tax loss in the second half, which started at the end of April. The share price fell FFr31 to close at FFr405.10. 'They are in a risky business,' said one Paris-based industry analyst. 'It is not just the economic environment they have to contend with but the threats of civil war, terrorism and political turmoil too.' He forecast the group would now incur a loss for the full year of about FFr50m (Pounds 5.75m) before exceptional items. Club Med blamed the downturn in business prospects on several factors. Recession in Europe had prompted severe competition and a price war between tour operators, which had cut profit margins. Some important destinations had to be closed, and others suffered a sharp reduction in bookings. A holiday village in Israel, near the Lebanese border, was closed temporarily as a result of conflict in the region. Two resorts in Senegal had not been opened because of political unrest. In Turkey and Egypt, two of the company's most sought-after destinations, bookings had been disappointing. Kidnapping of western tourists in the former and terrorist attacks by Islamic fundamentalists in the latter led to a big fall in reservations. Yesterday's warning was made in a statement to Balo, an official publication which records quarterly results of French companies. The statement outlined the group's performance in the first half of its financial year, confirming that net profits had fallen to FFr2.15m from FFr20.3m in the same period of 1992. Industry analysts said first-half results had been buoyed by an accounting change which extended the depreciation of group assets and had a favourable impact of about FFr49m. The results also benefited from a strong contribution from the group's US and Asian operations, which made a pre-tax profit of about Dollars 32m (Pounds 22m) during the period. But the group's activities in these regions are traditionally much stronger in the first half and are unlikely to compensate for problems in Europe, the Middle East and Africa in the second six months. 'The problem they face is that they have a high level of fixed costs and a low level of revenues,' said one analyst in Paris. 'This will create strong pressure on their finances in the remainder of the year.' Club Med said it would maintain its investment plans at a level 'necessary to ensure clients a good level of service', but that the difficult environment meant it would have to make economies and reduce costs. But the company said that planned projects, such as a 700-bed holiday village on the Chinese island of Hainan, due to open in 1995, would not be affected.</p>

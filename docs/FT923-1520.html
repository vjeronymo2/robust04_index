			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Arts: 'Christophe Colomb', 'Mignon' - Opera The splendid royal palace of Compiegne, about one hour north of Paris, on the edge of the forest of the same name, now has an Imperial Theatre to add to its attractions. That 'now' points to a strange history. Napoleon III and his Empress, Eugenie, who both loved Compiegne and entertained there lavishly, found the existing theatre too small and commissioned a larger one, still incomplete when the Second Empire collapsed in 1870. Quite recently private sponsors banded together to restore the theatre and entrusted it to Pierre Jourdan's Theatre Francais de la Musique, an opera company formed to explore and revive forgotten corners of the rich French repertory. And so the Imperial Theatre finally opened its doors last autumn, about 120 years late. This year's operas are Christophe Colomb and Mignon. They are followed through the winter by a series of weekend concerts of French music. Compiegne being easy of access, the enterprise is an acquisition for Paris as well as for the neighbourhood. The theatre is large for even the grandest palace. The present capacity is 770 - about the same as the Glyndebourne we used to know but vastly different in shape and appearance - a wide, semi-circular auditorium with raked stalls, three balconies and side boxes. Those expecting a profusion of Second Empire gilt may be disappointed. Apart from plasterwork there is little decoration - plain greyish-white surfaces. But the architect Ancelet's strong, simple lines are as harmonious as they are imposing. The restoration was the work of Renaud Bardon, architect of the Musee d'Orsay. Milhaud and Claudel's Christophe Colomb, a monument of modern music and theatre in the 1920s, imposed itself this year, celebrating both the composer's centenary and the quincentenary of Columbus. Concert performances apart, this dauntingly demanding work has still not been given in Paris or the surrounding region. Nevertheless, since the Compiegne stage is by no means large as opera houses go, it was a brave decision. A crucial factor was the generous offer of the Gulbenkian Foundation in Lisbon to lend not only chorus, orchestra and ballet for the performances but to ensure adequate rehearsal time for preparation of the complicated score. The solo singers were French and mostly young. The conductor, Michel Swierczewski, is a Frenchman who has studied with Mackerras in Vienna and who is a regular visitor to Lisbon. Claude Lule produced, in designs by Jean-Yves Legavre and Juan Stoppani. One thing the venture did prove. Colomb, though no walkover, is not after all such an immense undertaking - it can be done, and worthily, on a fairly modest scale. Not that total success was won in this turbulent work in which episodes from the life of Columbus (rarely given in chronological order) are separated by spoken narrations and by comments and reactions from the chorus, all in Claudel's torrential language. Lule decided not to use film as specified by Claudel as an auxiliary means and substituted dancers. In the storm scene he even fell back on our old friend, dry ice (surely due for retirement). On the other hand the balletic treatment of the strange episode where Mexican gods unavailingly churn up the waters to repel the advancing caravels, was a great success - here as elsewhere the choreography of Olga Roriz was better than one usually finds in opera. The orchestra pit was covered, no doubt a wise precaution in view of the exuberance of much of Milhaud music. The result, with obviously careful preparation, was perfectly clear. Remembering its past excellence in Lisbon I was a little disappointed with the chorus. Perhaps there were too few voices in that gallant group. Milhaud wrote expertly for voices but he expects endless stamina over long stretches. There was some flagging, some sour intonation, and too few audible words - the simple, all-important phrases greeting the moment of discovery were mumbled. The Columbus, Laurent Naouri, is a most promising, musical baritone with a strong, tireless voice - the role is long and demanding. He has a good presence, but his white, centrally parted wig, aquiline features and long cassock reminded me fatally of a later and different kind of explorer - the Abbe Liszt. Naouri's jerky movements contrasted with the remarkable physical control of the narrator, Michel Hermon, an accomplished actor-singer who also (rather confusingly) sang the role of Columbus's alter ego. Mary Saint-Palais, a useful high soprano, had her moments as Queen Isabella but the right degree of limpidity for her rapt phrases was not always forthcoming. Pascal Mesle dealt ably with a number of tenor character roles. The fine passage describing 'the eye of the storm' lay low for him. It was unwise to have big, floppy programmes that they could hardly be opened without damaging the coiffure in front. Even then there was too little light to read them comfortably. A worth-while event in spite of minor flaws - and a shame there were only two public performances.</p>

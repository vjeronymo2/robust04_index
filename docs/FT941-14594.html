			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / International Company News: La Generale sells 4.1m shares in Suez Societe Generale de Belgique, the diversified Belgian holding company, appeared yesterday to have added to its war chest for possible acquisitions by disclosing the sale of 4.1m of its shares in its French parent, Compagnie Financiere de Suez. The Suez group said 3.2m of the shares had been bought at around the stock market price by Goldman Sachs and Banque Indosuez for sale to international investors. At yesterday's Paris close of FFr 345.30, this sale in Suez would give the Belgian holding company about FFr1.4bn (Dollars 237.2m). SGB has brought its cross-holding stake in Suez down to 1.5 per cent from 4.5 per cent, a level which it said it did not intend to change in the coming months. With its recent sales of shares in CBR, the Belgian cement company, and in Union Miniere, SGB has lifted liquidity to make possible purchases.</p>

			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: The value of valid tests Sir, I read with great interest your Recruitment article, 'Laying down the laws of selection' (May 4). There are three kinds of psychological tests that should not be used by industry for selecting new personnel or evaluating existing employees. These are tests that have been constructed to appear psychological, but have no validity; computer-produced tests that have no relevance to job functions; and tests developed for clinical use. None of these has real value in predicting job performance. There are, on the other hand, good psychological tests that have proven ability in predicting performance. Such tests will have a sound theoretical basis, have developed a valid database over the long term, and will have been periodically adjusted to account for changing business cultures. Also, they will be evaluated by professional occupational psychologists matching the test results to the functional requirements of the specific job. It is management's responsibility to invest extra effort to select only the valid tests. Not using scientifically proven and valid psychological tests to help make those all-important hiring, promotion or job-shift decisions is like refusing to use a word processor in favour of the traditional quill pen.

			<p><P> February 15, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PREP WEDNESDAY;  </P> <P> SOUTHERN SECTION BASKETBALL PLAYOFFS PREVIEWS;  </P> <P> 5-A;  </P> <P> TRYING TO BREAK THROUGH, AGAIN;  </P> <P> CAPISTRANO VALLEY HAS BEEN CLOSE, BUT HASN'T WON A TITLE  </P> <P> Will Capistrano Valley High School finally win that elusive Southern Section  basketball title in 1989? Or will Pasadena return to its glory days of the  1970s when it advanced to four large-school championship games in seven years?  </P> <P> Capistrano Valley has advanced to the semifinals five times in seven seasons  under Coach Mark Thornton. The Cougars have played in two championship games,  losing to Simi Valley in overtime, 70-64, for the 4-A title last year and to  Ridgecrest Burroughs, 66-55, in the 2-A title game in 1982.  </P> <P> Will the third time be a charm? Several coaches in the 5-A division think so.  Capistrano Valley (20-4) is seeded second behind Pasadena (22-2).  </P> <P> "I scouted Capistrano Valley last Wednesday, and I'd have to say they're the  class of the 5-A division," said John Dahl, veteran coach at Moreno Valley.  "They've got everything . . . a solid point guard, good height, excellent  shooting and a great player in (Scott) McCorkle."  </P> <P> McCorkle averages 24.1 points per game for Capistrano Valley, which has won 11  consecutive games since losing to Saddleback, 57-53, in the semifinals of the  Orange Holiday tournament.  </P> <P> But it was the improved play of point guard Chris Kostoff that carried the  Cougars to 10 consecutive victories in the South Coast League. Kostoff made 36  of 62 attempts from three-point range and boosted his scoring average to 15  points per game.  </P> <P> "Kostoff has made them a better team," said Rich Skelton, the Dana Hills coach.  "It's difficult to imagine anyone better than Capistrano Valley or Irvine in  the division."  </P> <P> Thornton, who cringed when Capistrano Valley was made the preseason choice as  Orange County's top-ranked team ahead of Mater Dei, isn't discounting his  team's chances.  </P> <P> "We've been a really good playoff team in the past, and I feel we're just  starting to hit our stride," he said.  </P> <P> Irvine (21-5) is seeded fourth. Second-year Coach Steve Keith is aiming for his  third Southern Section championship, having won the 4-A title in 1985 and the  2-A title in 1981, both while at Glendale.  </P> <P> Irvine has stumbled recently, losing two of its past three games. Not exactly  the type of momentum a coach wants going into the tournament.  </P> <P> "I wish there was something tangible I could point to, like an injury or  sickness to explain the way we finished the season," Keith said. "We had a  taxing preseason, but I thought it was important for our program to win those  tournaments. (Irvine won the Irvine World News and Coast Christmas  tournaments.)  </P> <P> "We came up short on the gas tank at the end of the season, but with a week  off, we'll have time to recharge our batteries."  </P> <P> Keith, who had some memorable games against Pasadena for the Pacific League  title while at Glendale, expects Pasadena to be a strong challenger for the 5-A  title.  </P> <P> "They were down a few years and took a back seat to Muir, but this year marked  a return to their glory years," Keith said. "They're athletic and quick."  Pasadena guard Idris Jones, who averages 20.7 points, 5 rebounds, 4 steals and  3 assists per game, has signed to attend UC Santa Barbara.  </P> <P> Buena (19-4) is seeded third and was the runner-up to Rio Mesa in the Channel  League. Buena advanced to the 4-A quarterfinals last year before being  eliminated by Santa Ana.  </P> <P> Buena is one of the best three-point shooting teams in Southern California.  Junior guard Jeff Oliver averages 18 points per game but 6-foot-5 center Adan  Valencia is the only player with good size on the team.  </P> <P> Among the unseeded teams, Ocean View (17-8) is the strongest entry. Ocean  View's record is deceiving, with six of its losses coming against Mater Dei  (twice), Fountain Valley, St. Paul, Huntington Beach and Edison, all playoff  entries.  </P> <P> "The first thing I noticed when I picked up the playoff sheet was that Ocean  View was in our bracket, and I didn't like that," Capistrano Valley's Thornton  said. "I've always thought they were the best team we've played all year."  </P> <P> Ocean View defeated Capistrano Valley, 72-62, in the semifinals of the  Tournament of Champions, despite a 35-point performance by McCorkle.  </P> <P> Looking for a sleeper? Edison (14-12) is the only team to beat 2-A powerhouse  Santa Clara, and Coach Jon Borchert's teams have a habit of disrupting favored  opponents with strong defensive play.  </P> <P> But Edison won't be playing its second-round game on its home court Friday  night. School officials discounted the team's chances of making the playoffs  before the season. They scheduled a divisional championship wrestling match in  the school's gymnasium.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 5-A IN A BOX  </P> <P> Teams to beat: Pasadena (22-2), Capistrano Valley (20-4), Ocean View (17-8) and  Irvine (21-5).  </P> <P> Dark horse: Edison (14-12).  </P> <P> Players to watch: Bryan Allred (Irvine), Idris Jones (Pasadena), Scott McCorkle  (Capistrano Val- ley), Todd Norman (Ocean View), Jeff Oliver (Buena).  </P> <P> Best first-round game: El Toro (13-12) at Los Alamitos (11-14).  </P> <P> Final Four prediction: Pasadena vs. Irvine, Ocean View vs. Capistrano Valley.  </P></p>

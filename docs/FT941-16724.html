			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Outlook brightens for Maxwell pensioners: The quest to replace lost fund assets Bank of America's surprise announcement earlier this week that it would pay Pounds 25m to the Mirror Group Newspapers pension scheme is the first good news in months for some 20,000 pensioners. It has raised hopes that financial institutions, professional advisers and insurance companies, all of which had dealings with Robert Maxwell, may be preparing to make significant contributions to the pension schemes that were depleted in the Maxwell era. 'I think 1994 is going to be a good year for us,' said an adviser to one former Maxwell company pension scheme whose members are still seeking nearly half their assets. Trustees and advisers to the schemes point to two factors which have made them more hopeful than at any time since more than Pounds 440m was discovered missing in December 1991. First, the efforts of Sir Peter Webster, the former High Court judge appointed to help find a 'global solution', are said to be quietly making progress. Sir Peter is said to have met with all the banks and financial institutions holding assets which are also claimed by the pension schemes. 'One problem has been that some banks wanted not just a global solution but an inter-galactic solution,' said one adviser to the pension schemes. In short, they had hoped that a payment to the pension scheme would cause all claims against them from shareholders or other parts of the Maxwell empire to be dropped. Since last autumn, Sir Peter is said to have persuaded them that the inter-galactic solution is not practicable. But the chief difficulty he has encountered was predictable. According to sources familiar with the talks, each bank wishes to minimise the amount of cash it must ultimately return to the pensioners. For many assets there are several possible financial institutions from which the schemes could demand restitution, so each bank has been reluctant even to discuss how much it is prepared to concede lest it let one of its competitors off the hook. Sir Peter has managed to persuade the reluctant banks that any conversation he has is confidential. One scheme adviser said: 'He sends you a note inviting you to ring for an appointment to see him. It's all very informal.' He is so concerned about confidentiality that notes of each meeting refer only to the individuals and their bank in a code 'so that if the notes fall into the wrong hands, no one will understand them', one adviser explained. Also, Sir Peter has apparently been willing to think broadly about solutions for financing the Maxwell pensioners, and is not insisting that each institution simply pay a single lump sum into the pot. Insurance companies which provided director's liability policies, now refusing to pay hundreds of millions of pounds in claims, have been told it may be possible for them to spread their contributions over a long period because pension liabilities will come due over a period perhaps as long as the next 20 to 40 years. Sir Peter is said to be working to a timetable which contemplates completion of an agreement by the middle of next summer. Another significant new factor is a recent High Court judgment. At face value, the case was a victory for the defendants, Lehman Brothers, the investment bank, Credit Suisse, Swiss Volksbank and Morgan Stanley, who were being challenged by Macmillan over the ownership of shares in Berlitz International. Although Macmillan lost the case, in a 31-page summary Mr Justice Millett said it might have won against Lehman Brothers in particular had its lawyers argued that Lehman Brothers knew or ought to have known that the Berlitz shares in question belonged to pension fund trustees; that stock borrowing activities which Lehman was party to were inappropriate for a pension fund; and that Lehman should never have taken possession of the shares in the first place. In a series of writs filed against Lehman Brothers and others, trustees for the pension schemes are making precisely the argument that Mr Justice Millett concluded might have succeeded in court. In a 158-page writ served last autumn, liquidators to the Maxwell-controlled fund manager Bishopsgate Investment Management detailed conversations and correspondence over a two-year period which aim to demonstrate precisely that point. For its part, Lehman Brothers says it believes it has a strong case and that it is prepared to go to court. However, the investment bank said it had spoken to Sir Peter and would consider some sort of global solution in an effort to rid itself of a lengthy, expensive and embarrassing legal battle.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Kost Chavaha: "Dollars in a Zinc Coffin"] </F>   [Text] Trains loaded with military equipment painted in  white crossed the state border yesterday at the city of Chop.  The second battalion from the Ciscarpathian Military District  is rushing to reinforce UN peacekeeping forces in Bosnia, more  precisely, in the hottest spot there -- the Muslim enclave of  Gorazhde. Our young compatriots, who have given their consent  to don "blue helmets," have already begun to count the "bucks"  they will be paid for each day of service. Some of them will  get $600 per month, while others will be paid $900. For this  money, not even an unemployed American black man would agree to  stick his neck out and risk being shot. The current misery and  willingness to honestly, though with a great deal of risk,  improve their family's financial situation without resorting to  criminal activities, have forced the boys and men of Galicia to  go to the Balkans. Watching the picturesque beaches of Balaton  Lake roll past as they ride in the railroad cars, they do not  yet suspect that UN technical services have already taken care  of their front service and possible dark days await them.    According to Zagreb radio, additional zinc coffins have  recently been stockpiled in military warehouses. It is no  secret that the subsequent truce may prove unstable. Even  though the Serbs have been forced to agree on a cease-fire and  their cannons have been temporarily silenced, they have  frequently violated previous agreements and shown an arrogant  attitude toward peacekeepers. It was enough for Moscow to  beckon Belgrade with its finger and the Serbian separatists  recaptured the cannons seized by the Russian "blue" troopers on  a previous day. In the vicinity of Gorazhde, Russian soldiers  have also ended up among the UN hostages.    What can be said about the exceptionally obedient Ukrainian  soldiers? By the way, they will be exposed to great military  pressures in Bosnia. On the one hand, they will have to bend to  the Kiev leadership, which continues to tailgate its "elder  brother" in formulating foreign policy, while on the other hand,  the Serbs are angry at Ukraine because it does not exhibit an  openly pro-Russian attitude and has certain relations with  Croatia. In addition, the Croatian Ruthenians and Ukrainians,  as well as official Zagreb, have not abandoned their intentions  to recapture Vukovar and other territories occupied by the Serbs.    Thus, the Ukrainian peacekeepers will not have to only carry  out the instructions of the UN secretary general, but also  permanently watch the behavior of their "elder brothers" -- the  Russians and the Serbs. Otherwise, the Serbian cutthroats will  not pay attention to the fact that our boys are wearing "blue  helmets." Speaking in a generally calm manner during a meeting  marking the anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster, Ukrainian  President Leonid Kravchuk nervously reacted to a banner carried  by Ukrainian "Greenpeace" activists -- who demanded that all the  lethal Chernobyl reactors be closed down -- explaining that  there are no ways to raise money for energy resources, without  which Ukraine will choke. This is an open lie however, and so  are the statements that there is no money for essential  medicines, raw materials, and spare parts for industrial  enterprises, which have already put workers and engineers into  despair and made them ready to take any steps. The high  leadership, however, has managed to shake out huge amounts of  hard currency from the state coffers to finance the UN  peacekeeping battalions in former Yugoslavia.    Of course, nobody is against additional ways of earning  money, even if they are dangerous, but, I repeat, they must be  decent. Why, however, should this generate further  impoverishment among a huge part of society? It is  understandable that officials in the capital on the Dnepr are  trying to look honorable before the world, especially the United  Nations, and in this way pay for the debts of the Ukrainian SSR  to this international organization. Ukraine has already lost  its stake in the foreign property of the former USSR to Russia.  Since Yeltsin's Russia has pronounced itself the inheritor to  the Bolshevik empire, why would official Kiev not ask Moscow to  pay the United Nations for the bills of KGB agents who were  exclusively performing assignments for the Kremlin, hiding  behind the USSR banner?    Yet another question arises: Did anybody consult leaders of  the oblasts comprising the Ciscarpathian Military District, when  the issue of the second peacekeeping battalion first arose?  Were the deaths of our sons and daughters in Afghanistan and  Chernobyl not enough? Do we have to send them to the Balkan  slaughterhouse as well? One can only hope that in the new  parliament there will be deputies who will address this issue  directly to Ukraine's highest authorities.</p>

			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / Observer: Sound sleepers but only to those who voted Conservative in last week's UK election. David Malloch, proprietor of the Lathones Manor Hotel, says that two nights' dinner, bed and breakfast in a twin or double room would normally cost Pounds 88 per person. But he is offering it at Pounds 53 if you can name the Tory candidate in your constituency and swear, at check-in, that you voted Tory. He says he doesn't expect widespread abuse, though 'anyone who appears very unconvincing may have to explain the benefits of Tory policies'.</p>

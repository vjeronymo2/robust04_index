			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Capital seeks fresh adventure - Scarcity of deals for the UK houses means that something must give A year ago UK venture capitalists were somewhat apprehensive. They were celebrating an extremely good year during which many companies they backed had floated. But there were serious doubts whether all the venture capital houses seeking to replenish their funds would be able to do so. Talk of venture capital groups being forced to merge was rife. Quite separately, there was concern whether there were enough financeable deals about. A year later most of these fears have come to nothing. Even venture capitalists demonstrating weaker track records have successfully raised funds, although they have had to scour the US to raise the money. And with one notable exception, there have been few forced mergers. Much of the consolidation has brought new commitment to the development capital industry. But there is a problem with deal flow. Particularly at the larger end of the market, there are too many venture capitalists chasing too few deals. According to a report from the management buy-out group of accountants Ernst &amp; Young, this is the single biggest issue the UK venture capital industry must confront in the coming years. Ernst &amp; Young's research is based on an independent study of UK venture capitalists, fund investors on both sides of the Atlantic, corporations that have been or are likely to sell subsidiaries, and venture-backed companies.* Many of the UK's larger development capitalists made net divestments from their portfolios in 1993 and are continuing to do so this year. The good news for venture capitalists, the survey says, is that vendors are not preparing to curtail their divestment activities at all. Such optimism should be tempered by the fact that the relatively low level of mergers and acquisitions activity in the last two years will have reduced the number of opportunities for MBOs and management buy-ins. Ironically, the successful year of fundraising exacerbates the problem. There are not enough deals to go round. Something has to give. Ernst &amp; Young believes venture capitalists might react in the following ways: Lowering returns. Nearly two thirds of the venture capitalists surveyed expected no change to their own internal rate of return requirement during the next two years. Of the remainder, three quarters expected downward pressure on returns. Venture capitalists have lowered their targets for IRRs from above 30 per cent, where they have been for years, to the mid- to high-20s, says Martyn Aguss, part of Ernst &amp; Young's MBO team. More debt in deals. Since many banks withdrew from the market in 1990 - after their unhappy involvement in very highly leveraged deals in the late 1980s - there has been a shortage of senior debt providers. That is now changing. Banks are increasingly willing to provide debt and are prepared to see gearing ratios rise quite sharply from the one-to-one level that has prevailed for the last few years. That is likely to allow vendors to ask purchasers for higher prices and for venture capitalists to be able to fund them without undermining their returns. Venture capitalists will increasingly bid as principal on the larger deals, competing directly with trade buyers. To a lesser extent, the venture capitalists will also be bidding against management buy-out teams, Ernst &amp; Young says. Backing quality management remained a priority but the incidence of financial bids, as they are called, was likely to increase. Gone are the days when an MBO team ran an auction between equity suppliers and chose the venture capitalist that offered the best deal to management, not to the vendor. * Development Capital in the UK - Responding to Changing Demands.

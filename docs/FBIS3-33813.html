			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Shaykh 'Abdallah al-Ahmar, speaker of the </F> Yemeni House of Representatives, by Salih al-Qallab in Sanaa;  date not given]    [Text] [Al-Qallab] We have heard that you have reservations  on some points in the document of understanding. Which are  these points?    [Al-Ahmar] In the first place, I want to say that our  acceptance of the dialogue that led to this document was based  on our eagerness to maintain the Yemeni unity. Our acceptance  of most of what the document contains was based on the desire to  satisfy the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] because it hinted at  separation, and we do not want separation.    [Al-Qallab] But what are your reservations?    [Al-Ahmar] We have reservations, and the team that  represented us in the dialogue registered these reservations in  the minutes of the meetings.    [Al-Qallab] Are your reservations on the point concerning  local government, or are there other issues?    [Al-Ahmar] We have reservations on more than one issue, but  as I said we accepted dialogue in the first place for the sake  of unity, and we offered several concessions to the YSP since  the beginning of unity and until today for the sake of unity.    [Al-Qallab] Do your reservations mean that you do not accept  this document?    [Al-Ahmar] No, we accept the document, but we have  reservations on some of its points.    [Al-Qallab] What is one of these points?    [Al-Ahmar] One of these points is that we reject the  division  of Yemen into regions or semi-states. Yemen should be divided  into administrative units, which are the governorates.    [Al-Qallab] We heard that you insist that the document  should  be worked out by the House of Representatives and not by the  dialogue committee that represents the main parties. Is that  true?    [Al-Ahmar] This is untrue. The dialogue committee is not a  constitutional establishment. The House of Representatives is  the legislative establishment. The document includes some  procedural points that do not need parliamentary approval, and  includes other topics that should be presented to the House of  Representatives because they conflict with the constitution.    [Al-Qallab] President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih received an  invitation from His Majesty King Husayn to meet in Jordan. Do  you think this meeting will end the crisis?    [Al-Ahmar] If, after the signing of the document in Jordan,  the brothers in the YSP return to Sanaa to carry out their  duties, then this will be the beginning of resolving the crisis,  but if after the signing everyone returns to his present  position and to where he is now, then nothing will change and  the crisis will continue.    [Al-Qallab] Did you settle this issue with the YSP?    [Al-Ahmar] The dialogue committee is continuing its efforts,  and it is the party that can answer your question.    [Al-Qallab] Does this mean that you want the president and  the vice president to return to Sanaa aboard the same plane  after they sign the agreement in Amman?    [Al-Ahmar] Yes. This is a natural thing if we want the  crisis to end and the document to be implemented.    [Al-Qallab] But the brothers in the YSP say that there have  to be security measures before they return to Sanaa so they can  resume their normal duties.    [Al-Ahmar] This is a pretext. Since unity was achieved,  they have been safe among us. Their brothers in the north  received them with open arms.    [Al-Qallab] But if you remember the famous incident when  Prime Minister al-'Attas's motorcade was stopped at a checkpoint  and was about to be prevented from entering Sanaa?    [Al-Ahmar] This is not true. What happened is that when a  large motorcade arrived at that checkpoint, the policemen only  wanted to check the identity of the official who was escorted by  this large motorcade. When they found out who he was they  saluted him and let the motorcade proceed.    [Al-Qallab] The brothers in the YSP say they have lost  around 152 officials in explosions and assassinations and that  their houses and families were constantly harassed.    [Al-Ahmar] This is a big lie, and if we wanted to escalate  things, we would sue them for such claims.    [Al-Qallab] What is the case, then?    [Al-Ahmar] All these figures are incorrect, except for one  or two. They know who did the killings.    [Al-Qallab] The YSP says its leaders will not go back to  Sanaa before the suspects in the assassinations and explosions  are tried and military troops are withdrawn from the cities?    [Al-Ahmar] The first demand is approved by everybody. Yes,  we insist that the criminals be tried and security be achieved.  We are against sheltering or abetting criminals.    [Al-Qallab] What about withdrawing the army from the cities?    [Al-Ahmar] We in Sanaa regard the Armed Forces as the  protectors of the homeland and of Sanaa. The Army of the Yemeni  Arab Republic has never gone on a rampage in Sanaa as the YSP  Army did in Aden.    [Al-Qallab] It is said that Yemeni authorities have managed  to seize some lists of the names of the "Jihad" group that is  behind the incidents in Yemen and some incidents in Egypt. Is  this true?    [Al-Ahmar] Investigations have proven that all those  elements and their camps are in the southern and eastern  governorates. None of them is in the north.    [Al-Qallab] But the lists Egypt handed over to the Yemeni  envoys speak differently.    [Al-Ahmar] No such lists have been handed over. The  Egyptians say it was Aden Governor Salih Munassar al-Siyali who  informed them about the presence of extremists' camps in the  north during a secret visit to Egypt. This is an unfounded  falsehood.    [Al-Qallab] But, Shaykh 'Abdallah, foreign oil experts  continue to be kidnapped in the north and this harms the  reputation of Yemen.    [Al-Ahmar] These kidnappings are directed by the YSP in  order  to underscore the impression that the security situation in the  north is unstable and that there are terrorist acts and  kidnappings. All elements undertaking these vile operations are  supported by the YSP.    [Al-Qallab] Reports say the three tourists whose release is  now being negotiated were kidnapped by the Hashid tribe.    [Al-Ahmar] They belong to the al-Ahfum tribe, which  sometimes  says it is from Hashid and other times from Bakil. It is a  small tribe, but the ones who kidnapped them are from the YSP,  from Sufyan. They did so in return for 100,000 riyals.    [Al-Qallab] Apparently, the gap between the three coalition  parties--the YSP, the General People's Congress [GPC], and the  Reform Grouping--is still very big. What step do you think is  necessary to end the present crisis?    [Al-Ahmar] The first step is to unify the army. Unifying the  army is the beginning of the unification of the state. We want  the army to be an army for the whole country and not for  parties. There is now an army for 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and  another for 'Ali Salim al-Bid.    [Al-Qallab] Some say there are four armies in Yemen: An army  for 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, an army for 'Ali Salim al-Bid, an army  for 'Ali Nasir Muhammad, and an army for the Reform Grouping.  What is your opinion?    [Al-Ahmar] This is not true. There are only two armies.  They are the army of the south, which is 'Ali Salim al-Bid's  army, and the army of the north, which is 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's  army.    [Al-Qallab] It is noted that following the recent crisis the  state of affairs has reverted to the pre-unity stage. Has  division become a fait accompli?    [Al-Ahmar] For your information, the situation now is much  worse than it was before the unity. The bitterness existing now  as a result of lack of confidence is much greater than that  which existed four years ago.    [Al-Qallab] Why?    [Al-Ahmar] Because of lack of confidence and because unity  was based on power sharing between the YSP and the GPC. I can  frankly tell you that unity as well as pluralism and democracy  have not entered the southern and eastern governorates.</p>

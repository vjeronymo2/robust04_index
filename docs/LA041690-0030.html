On Saturday, John  Paul cabled Lithuania's Cardinal Vicentas Sladkevicius expressing support in  "these hours of trepidation and hope."  </P> <P> For the polyglot ceremony marking the Resurrection of Jesus, the holiest feast  day for the world's 850 million Roman Catholics, the 69-year-old Pope preached  from the Gospel of St. John (16:33): "I have overcome the world!"  </P> <P> "Only the risen Christ can fully satisfy your irrepressible yearning for  freedom," John Paul said, addressing people "of our time."  </P> <P> As fat, cold drops of rain began to sprinkle the crowd, the Pope applauded  progress of human beings toward burying their violent past.  </P> <P> "After the horrors of two world wars and all the (other) wars which in these  last 60 years, often in the name of godless ideologies, have reaped the harvest  of victims and sewn hatred in so many nations . . . the true dimensions of the  spirit have been discovered anew," the Pope said.  </P> <P> "Today as well," John Paul continued, "the awakening of many democracies is  leading to dialogue and trust between peoples; and the world is coming to  understand once again that man cannot live without God."  </P> <P> Stressing the internationality of John Paul's concerns, participants in his  Easter Mass addressed the giant crowd in Italian, Spanish, English, Albanian,  Polish, Portuguese, German and French. After his address, the Pope delivered  his customary Easter greetings in all of those languages and more than two  dozen others, ranging from Croatian to Thai, from Hebrew to Mandarin.  </P> <P> "A blessed Easter in the joy of Jesus Christ, the risen Lord and Savior of the  world," he said in English.  </P> <P> Respectful pilgrims from Poland and other Eastern European countries mixed in  the giant plaza before St. Peter's with richer West Europeans and the African  and Filipino residents who give a Third World flavor to many corners of Rome.  </P> <P> John Paul recalled his exhausting January trip to five of the poorest nations  on earth, in Africa's Sahel region.  </P> <P> "I have been in the Sahel, and I have seen the sand burying villages, drying up  wells, burning the eyes, turning children into skeletons . . . as it brings  desperation, starvation, sickness and death -- death from hunger and thirst,"  the Pope said.  </P> <P> Again and again in his African trip, John Paul urged that Third World needs not  be overlooked in the rush to aid emerging democracies in Eastern Europe.  </P> <P> Sunday, with the graphic account of the suffering he had witnessed in Africa,  John Paul spoke directly once again to "wealthy nations of the civilization of  opulence."  </P> <P> "Do not be indifferent to this great tragedy," he pleaded. "Let human and  Christian solidarity be the challenge that provokes your conscience. . ."  </P> <P> John Paul's twin concerns for the development of democracy in Eastern Europe  and the fight against hunger in poor southern nations will be reflected in his  remaining trips this year. On Saturday, he leaves for a two-day visit to  Czechoslovakia. On May 6, he goes to Mexico, and in the fall he returns to  Africa.  </P> <P> Easter IN JERUSALEM: Thousands of Christians join observance in Jerusalem. A11  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two commenters object to statements in the background and discussion of the NPRM that new generation systems and airframes are more vulnerable to the indirect effects of lightning than previous designs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA agrees that new generation systems are not necessarily more vulnerable to the indirect effects of lightning if proper design, shielding, and grounding techniques are used. However, the use of sensitive electronics that respond to low level voltage commands makes these systems potentially more vulnerable if they are not properly designed and shielded. Reduced electromagnetic shielding provided by nonmetallic airframe materials also raises the potential for system interference from lightning. The intent of these new lightning protection requirements is to maintain the level of safety that is inherent in the older airplane designs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two commenters point out that preamble statements are vital to defining logical, usable, and economically feasible rules, and suggest that specific technologies, system architectures, and function susceptibility criteria must be provided instead of generalities if the FAA desires to justify the rule on a sound technical basis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA does not concur. In order to avoid stifling innovation, the FAA specifies the required safety objective in a regulation rather than dictating specific design details, whenever possible. In accordance with long-standing certification practice, system technologies and architectures are proposed by the applicant, allowable function susceptibility is determined on a case-by-case basis by the local cognizant FAA certification office using published FAA policy and engineering judgment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter expresses concern that application of the proposed rule to existing airplanes could present problems for supplemental type certification (STC) applicants when new systems are installed. Many airlines, for example, do not have the capability to demonstrate compliance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA considers lightning to be an environmental condition that must be taken into consideration to assure confidence of safe operation when a new system is installed in an airplane. Equipment manufacturers have historically used the test procedures in RTCA Document DO&hyph;160 to qualify their equipment to environmental conditions. The capability of the equipment to meet the tests described in this document establishes a minimum level of protection for system components. Additional protection may be provided by the airframe materials, shielding of wire bundles, proper equipment grounding, etc. In addition to bench tests, a determination should be made that systems that perform critical and essential functions, as installed in a given airplane, are provided with adequate protection, including margins, and that installation level testing and/or verified analysis is adequate. This determination is made by the cognizant FAA Aircraft Certification Office, based on guidance contained in AC 20&hyph;136, and sound engineering judgment. In addition, the FAA has issued special conditions for new systems in existing airplanes under the provisions of &sect;21.101(b)(2). The extent of review required for a system installed in existing airplanes will depend on the type of system, installation considerations such as type of airplane, airframe materials (metallic or composite), service experience in ``similar'' airplanes, and other factors. These evaluations should be reviewed with the cognizant FAA Aircraft Certification Office so that the FAA and the applicant can agree on a certification plan. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter states that the proposed requirement for lightning protection of essential systems is not justified and should not be adopted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA disagrees with this comment. Lightning encounters, even though infrequent , do occur. Therefore, a degree of protection is required commensurate with the criticalness of the function that the system performs. Protection requirements are much less stringent for systems that perform essential functions than for those that perform critical functions. System components may be damaged as long as the function can be recovered after the lightning encounter. The justification for imposing requirements for systems that perform essential functions is that loss of function would unacceptably decrease the inherent level of safety of the airplane. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter questions whether manufacturers would be responsible for testing and recertifying critical electronic control systems now in service. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The new lightning protection requirements apply to systems that perform critical and essential functions of which design approval is sought after the effective date of the rule. Recertificating in-service units is not required. If an in-service problem that affects the safety of the airplane were discovered, an airworthiness directive would be issued requiring corrective action. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter does not consider that the imposition of additional lightning protection requirements on systems of conventional design is justified if service history has shown that they are insensitive to lightning transients. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA does not intend to impose additional lightning protections requirements on systems using standard designs and installation that can be shown to have an inherent history of acceptability. It is FAA policy to accept similarity with previously proven installation designs, simulated lightning tests, or acceptable analysis. Individual designs should be reviewed by the cognizant FAA Aircraft Certification Office. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters disagree that the incremental cost of implementing the new rule will be zero. These comments and the FAA's response are addressed in the Regulatory Evaluation discussion that follows. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Notice 89&hyph;15 proposed that the lightning protection standard be adopted as &sect;25.1315 of the FAR. The paragraph used for the final rule was changed to &sect;25.1316 so that a future conflict could be avoided in the event the FAA determines that JAR 25.1315, ``Negative Acceleration,'' should be adopted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> January 10, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CAN'T ANYONE IN L.A. HOLD CHIEF GATES ACCOUNTABLE?  </P> <P> There is, unfortunately, precedent for the Los Angeles City Council's decision  to use the taxpayers' money to pay for a jury judgment of punitive damages  against Police Chief Daryl F. Gates. The city's Mexican community still has  painful memories of a similar council action in 1970. The reprise should raise  concerns about our city government's attitude toward police officers'  accountability for their actions and, ultimately, about the power of the police  Establishment in Los Angeles politics.  </P> <P> In the 1970 case, heavily armed Los Angeles Police Department officers  searching for a murder suspect stormed the wrong Skid Row hotel room. They shot  all its occupants -- unarmed, innocent Mexican immigrants. Two of the men ("the  Sanchez cousins," as they have become known) were killed and three wounded.  Later the police said that the man being sought was no longer a suspect in the  murder.  </P> <P> An outraged Latino community demanded that the officers be held accountable for  their actions, calling for their prosecution and removal from the force. The  district attorney's office filed criminal charges against the officers, and the  FBI announced that it also would prosecute them under federal civil-rights  statutes. But, under intense pressure from the police Establishment, the City  Council voted to pay for the officers' defense.  </P> <P> Eventually the criminal charges against the officers were dismissed and they  were acquitted of the federal charges. The department took no disciplinary  measures against them.  </P> <P> The current case involving Gates stems from a federal jury's finding that  several LAPD officers had, by using excessive force in a search, violated the  civil rights of a low-income Latino family named Larez. The jury also found  that Gates had condoned the officers' unlawful behavior, and it ordered him to  pay $170,000 in punitive damages.  </P> <P> The key to that finding lay in contemptuous and arguably racist remarks that  Gates had made outside the courtroom. As widely reported in the media, Gates  suggested that the Larezes were lucky that their beatings had not been worse,  that their injuries were not worth the amount awarded, and that they had been  "cleaned up" for their court appearances.  </P> <P> What followed was a fascinating demonstration of the police Establishment's  power with the city's political Establishment. Shortly after the jury verdict  was announced, Gates met in secret with City Council members and pressured them  into an immediate, unanimous and uncritical resolution to pay for the judgment  against him. By then Mayor Tom Bradley (himself a former LAPD officer) had  announced his support for Gates.  </P> <P> There was no need for the City Council to make its decision at this time. The  city is not required to pay for punitive damages imposed on its employees for  actions that they took in the course of city business. The city attorney's  office had already announced plans to appeal the verdict against Gates. The  council could have simply waited for the years of appeals to run their course  and then make the decision, if it was necessary.  </P> <P> Apparently the council felt compelled to send the community an immediate  political message of support for Gates. And, apparently, the council did so  without considering -- or, worse, with callous disregard for -- how that  message would be heard in the Latino community.  </P> <P> The most disturbing fact is that all this transpired without anyone in city  government daring to criticize Gates for his intemperate remarks. The message  is clear, and ominous: When the chips are down, holding police officers  accountable for unlawful actions is not a political priority.  </P> <P> The council's attitude in this matter adds mistrust of elected officials to the  damage that Gates has done to relations between the police and the community.  </P> <P> With many of our people locked in the inner city, the Latino community places  great value on good police protection. However, we also want protection from  officers who would misuse their authority. We therefore place equal value on  effective disciplinary policies and practices that ensure accountability of  police officers for their actions.  </P> <P> What's more, such policies must have the full, public support of the police  chief and his division commanders if they are to prevent intentional and  reckless conduct that violates peoples' human and civil rights.  </P> <P> Some things have changed since 1970. We even have Latinos on the City Council.  But apparently the police Establishment is still the most powerful political  force in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Some of the latest damage to community trust might still be repaired. For  starters, if it is not too much to ask, Gates should apologize for his  statements. If he does not, the mayor and the City Council should press him to  do so. And the council should reconsider, in public debate, its decision to pay  for the judgment. Then they all should re-examine and adjust the inadequate  policies, practices and attitudes toward police-officer accountability. Concern  for protecting the public's human and civil rights should override the powerful  political hand of the police.  </P></p>

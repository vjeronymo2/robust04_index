			<p><P> July 31, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PEOPLE: AT 4, SHE'D ALREADY FINGERED HER CAREER  </P> <P> It didn't take long for Harriet Wood to find her musical niche in life.  </P> <P> "I heard a harp record when I was 4 years old and told my parents that was the  music I wanted to play," said Wood, who now plays engagements all over the  area.  </P> <P> Wood first started playing piano, though, because her mother was a pianist. But  when she was 7, she rented a harp with money saved from her allowance.  </P> <P> "My mother decided if I was that determined, she would get me a harp, and I've  been playing one ever since." Wood went on to study music at the University of  Oregon and at the Juilliard School of Music, and she has taught harp at  Fullerton College and Cal State Fullerton.  </P> <P> Wood, who lives in Long Beach, has for 11 years been playing for the Sunday  brunch crowd on the Queen Mary. She has been a member of the Disneyland  Orchestra; played three years at the Crystal Cathedral in Garden Grove, often  as a soloist, and performed at the Westin South Coast Plaza hotel in Costa Mesa  for 10 years.  </P> <P> During those years, Wood was one of a number of musicians who visited Orange  County elementary schools to show and play their instruments to the children.  </P> <P> "Some of those years I would visit 60 schools," she said. "It was an  educational program that gave the students an up-close look at various  instruments."  </P> <P> Her interest in the harp has never waned.  </P> <P> "I love to play it,"she said. "Having the sound around me is just as pleasing  to me as it has ever been."  </P> <P> She apparently has passed on her enthusiasm to her daughter, Marsha, 30, who  plays harp at the Westgate Hotel in San Diego.  </P> <P> The harp sound is becoming more popular, Wood says. She performs at receptions  for women's clubs, weddings, bar mitzvahs and in theme programs for Valentine's  Day, Easter and Halloween. Recently, Wood played at the reception of the  Radiation and Health Fair at the Anaheim Hilton Hotel.  </P> <P> "It's fun doing programs," she said. "Sometimes I pick up ideas for the theme  by reading the newspaper."  </P> <P> One of her themes, for example, revolved around wigs -- Wood played music from  countries where wigs were developed.  </P> <P> The harp is popular for such events, she says, because "people find it is nice  background for dinner music because they can talk over it, even in groups" and  the flavor of the harp sound won't be affected.  </P> <P> Even with her playing schedule, Wood still practices every day.  </P> <P> "You never get so good you know everything," she says. Besides, "it's a lot of  work to keep my fingers calloused so they don't hurt when I play. You do that  by practicing."  </P> <P> Wood said she doesn't get much attention from the audience when she's providing  the background music, but "that doesn't bother me a bit. I'm usually wrapped up  in the sound of what I'm doing." She noted, though, that there are people who  do pay attention to the music, much of which she arranges herself.  </P> <P> The songs range from classical to popular. She says she likes all music  equally.  </P> <P> "I try to make everything I play as orchestral as possible."  </P> <P> Buoyed by the success of their own fund-raising and some help from parents, 14  members of the Huntington Beach Junior Lifeguard Team will compete in the World  Lifesaving Championships in Lubeck, Germany, next month.  </P> <P> That event, which takes place Aug. 11 through 15, will have teams from 30  countries. To make sure they're tuned up for it, the Huntington Beach group  will be competing in another meet in Wales this Saturday and Sunday.  </P> <P> The students who are participating are between 14 and 18 years old and were  chosen from among 700 swimmers in the program. They are Julie Jackle, Louis  Lopez, Amy Martin, Juli Anna Matto, Keith Metzger, Wendy Monahan, Jeffery  Moohr, Kellie Ortega, Chad A. Prior, David J. Prior, Kelli Quinn, Greg Reddish,  Erin Staunton and Bryan Walker.  </P></p>

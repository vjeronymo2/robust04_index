			<p>Language: <F P=105> Zulu </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Comment and Opinion" page] </F>   [Text] ILANGA recently learnt that ANC [African National  Congress] intelligence supremo Moe Shaik is a man on the move.    Some time ago, as part of a campaign against MK [Spear of  the  Nation; ANC military wing] murders, the IFP [Inkatha Freedom  Party] staged a protest outside Shaik's house. It also  announced that Mr. Shaik was the Natal director of the ANC's  sinister Department of Intelligence and Security (DIS).    Because of his position the IFP alleged that he must at  least  bear knowledge of MK's involvement in the serial murder of IFP  leaders.    The ANC's Southern Natal regional executive committee (REC)  then issued a statement admitting that Shaik was an ordinary  member of the ANC but denying he was a member of DIS or involved  in MK.    Shaik then shot to prominence during February 1993 when he  was included in an ANC team tasked to investigate the Golela  arms-smuggling incident, implicating several senior members of  MK and the ANC. The ANC investigation team included MK Chief of  Staff Siphiwe Nyanda and NEC [National Executive Committee]  member Mathew Phosa.    If the earlier Southern Natal REC statement is to be  believed  Shaik's rise through the ranks of the ANC was astounding.  However the rise of the Secret Shaik does not end there.    Moe Shaik has been appointed to the TEC's [Transitional  Executive Committee] intelligence subcouncil but not as an ANC  representative. The ANC representative is Alfred Nzo, one of  Shaik's colleagues in DIS. Mr. Shaik is actually the SACP  [South African Communist] representative on the subcouncil.    ILANGA recently obtained a top secret National Intelligence  Service (NIS) report which touted members for the proposed  cabinet of a government of national unity. Imagine our surprise  when one Riaz Moe Shaik was named as Minister of Intelligence  Services.    ILANGA soon received a further shock when it studied another  top secret report, this time an ANC document entitled "ANC  Proposals for a Government of National Unity Cabinet." Shaik  was again punted for Minister of Intelligence Services.    One doubts whether this is simply a coincidence. Instead it  may be the result of what is known in the SACP as collective  decisionmaking. What is new is that the South African  Government has become part of the collective. One thing is  clear though: a lot of people are clearly rewarding Moe Shaik  for something.</p>

			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Taiwan's China negotiator quits TAIWAN'S chief negotiator with China said yesterday he would resign after bitter disputes within the Taiwan government over policy towards Beijing, Reuter reports from Taipei. 'If I cannot make use of my ability under this environment, it will be a waste of my time and have a negative impact on improving relations between the two sides,' said Mr Cheyne Chiu, secretary general of Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation. Local media quoted Mr Chiu as saying that he would quit at a foundation board meeting in November. The foundation handles talks with China in the absence of formal diplomatic contact. Mr Chiu, who became secretary general in March, handled intensive negotiations at a meeting between China and Taiwan in Singapore in April, the highest-level contact between the two old rivals since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949. He was known for a liberal attitude towards China, pledging to 'tear down the psychological Berlin Wall' and suggesting Taiwan consider lifting its ban on official contact. Taiwan's Securities and Exchange Commission, seeking to slow a flood of investment into China, yesterday formally banned companies from using issues of stock and convertible bonds to fund mainland projects.</p>

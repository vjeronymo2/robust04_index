			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Annual water bills to rise by 9.5% FROM today the average annual water and sewerage bill will be Pounds 185, a rise of 9.5 per cent on last year's Pounds 169. Bills in households with meters, which are on average about 10 per cent higher than bills in unmetered households, are expected to rise more slowly, by between 3 per cent and 4 per cent. Ofwat, the water regulator, is investigating whether metered households are being charged more than unmetered ones for the same amount of water, or whether they use more water or are located in areas with generally high water charges.</p>

			<p><P> April 21, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EXTENDING HEALTH COVERAGE  </P> <P> The column by Brown describes his bill that would mandate that every employer  provide health insurance for all employees who work more than "half time."  Incredible! As a small businessman, I request equal time.  </P> <P> Do Brown or any other legislator supping at the public trough have any concept  of the amount of income small business owners have? Don't any of those  "protectors of the commonweal" do any kind of research before proposing such  enormous economic burdens upon the populace? Consider the following:  </P> <P> California law currently requires that all businesses in the state provide  workers' compensation insurance for all their employees. The law mandates that  all businesses support state unemployment insurance. Laws are, in effect,  requiring that businesses pay an "employee training tax." There are mandatory  liability insurance laws; there are mandatory automobile insurance laws; there  are reams and reams of records that must be kept for years under threat of  prosecution should they be lost or incorrect. And now Brown has devised yet  another plan that "will keep government out of the insurance business."  Baloney! The very contemplation of the law puts government squarely in the  insurance business.  </P> <P> I cannot think of any governmentally mandated insurance program that is  two-ended. Speaker Brown would require health insurance, but would not mandate  lower insurance rates. "The market will determine the rates." Sure it will. The  reasons given for not regulating rates are mostly that government should not  become involved in the prices a business could charge for its  services/products. But Brown does not hesitate to force higher expenditures on  small businesses. Health insurance would cost about $150 to $250 per employee  per month, depending upon age. That translates to about $12,000 per year for a  5-employee business like mine. Where does Brown suggest that money come from?  Higher product prices? Still smaller profits (so that the proprietors earn less  than the employees?) Most small businesses (5 to 7 employees) are not making  anywhere near an income commensurate with the risks involved and the demands of  the marketplace. Add the cost of health insurance to workers' comp, SDI, and  all the others, and you have to wonder if it's worth staying in business at  all.  </P> <P> It's time for the California Legislature and Willie Brown to bite the bitter  pill of economic reality and recognize that if they want to make it mandatory  for us to buy a service or product, then they also must make that  service/product affordable. If they cannot guarantee that equality, then they  must leave us alone.  </P> <P> TOM FLANAGAN  </P> <P> Los Alamitos  </P></p>

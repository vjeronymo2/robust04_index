			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / BMW sales up 30% in first quarter BMW, the German carmaker, achieved a rise of nearly 30 per cent in sales during the first quarter of 1992, but Mr Eberhard von Kuenheim, chief executive, said the company would certainly not keep this up over the whole year. He also added some stern words to the warnings by German executives about the country's decreasing attraction as a production location, mentioning high costs, over-regulation, and bureaucratic inflexibility, especially in BMW's home city of Munich. But he declined to be drawn further on the possibility of BMW producing cars in the US, as reported this week. 'This is wholly in the stars,' he said. BMW had been considering whether to produce abroad, but had no preference for any particular location. BMW had looked at sites in the US - the one referred to this week was in South Carolina - and obviously had to think whether it should continue supplying North America from Germany. 'This is a theoretical question at the moment, but it could become very acute tomorrow.' He said the growth rate experienced in the first quarter could not be applied to the full year, as the results in January-March, 1991, had been held back by production changes caused by the introduction of the new 3-series, its smallest and most popular model. Total world sales in the first quarter of this year rose 29 per cent to 141,000 cars, with double-digit percentage rises in Germany, the US, the UK, France, and Italy. Turnover was 24 per cent higher at DM7.8bn. Barring unforeseen events, 'we assume that 1992 will be another successful year'. Production and sales should show a further rise from 1991, when group turnover rose by 10 per cent to DM29.8bn (Pounds 10.4bn), car output by 6.5 per cent to 553,000 units and net profits by 12.5 per cent to DM783m. Earnings per share were DM55, up from DM51. Like other car companies, BMW is reducing its labour force to curb costs. 'We have to consider what we can afford and what we cannot,' he said. 'It is a question of how much customers are prepared to pay.' This year's reduction, not involving redundancies, will be around 3,000 out of its workforce of 74,000.</p>

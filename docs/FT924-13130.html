			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / Du Pont and Mitsui to form alliance in Asian markets DU PONT Japan, the Japanese arm of the US chemical maker, and Mitsui, the Japanese trading house, yesterday announced plans to establish a joint venture company to increase both partners' penetration of Asian-Pacific markets. The new company, to be formed next month, will attempt to match Du Pont's product development skills with Mitsui's extensive regional branch network, as well as considering new product areas for both companies. Mitsui said the agreement followed an approach by Du Pont. It is a sign of Japanese companies' willingness to form strategic partnerships with foreign producers to take advantage of growing demand in Asian markets. The trading house has close ties to Mitsui Toatsu Chemicals, the country's third largest chemical manufacturer, and to Mitsui Petrochemical Industries, which are both members of the Mitsui keiretsu, or family of companies. Mitsui said the agreement with Du Pont would not compromise existing partnerships that the two have with other companies, nor would it disrupt their existing business networks in Asia. The new company, to be called Du Pont MBK Alliance, is likely to have a capital of Y100m (Pounds 467,000).</p>

			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRISIS IN THE PERSIAN GULF;  </P> <P> U.S. FIRMS TAKE STEPS TO PROTECT THEIR EMPLOYEES IN SAUDI ARABIA  </P> <P> The possible outbreak of hostilities prompted many American companies to make  hasty contingency plans for evacuating U.S. employees and dependents from Saudi  Arabia, and a number of firms began bringing employees' family members back  Wednesday.  </P> <P> The action followed a State Department travel advisory issued late Tuesday  night, which said the department was allowing dependents of U.S. government  personnel on a voluntary basis to leave the Eastern part of Saudi Arabia, as  well as the countries of Qatar, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates. The  advisory also recommended that private American citizens consider leaving as  well.  </P> <P> San Francisco-based Bechtel, an international engineering and construction  firm, said Wednesday that it was offering flights from the country to employees  working on non-essential projects and their families. Bechtel declined to  disclose the number of employees eligible, but about 900 staff and family  members live and work in Saudi Arabia, a spokesman said. The company will  continue to staff normal operations in the country, he said. However, most of  the dozens of companies contacted Wednesday said they didn't have immediate  plans to bring employees back. Companies said they were monitoring events  closely.  </P> <P> "Every hour is a different situation," said Herb Ryan, a spokesman for Dresser  Industries in Dallas, which has employees in Saudi Arabia working in oil and  gas exploration. "If they start shooting you have a whole different ballgame."  </P> <P> Mobil Corp., which has extensive interests in Saudi Arabia as well as 220  employees and 144 employees' dependents, said the dependents were being  evacuated. A Mobil spokesman in New York said they would be brought to Western  Europe on regularly scheduled flights as well as special charters. However,  Mobil said that unless the situation deteriorates further employees will  remain.  </P> <P> Other companies that began flying out dependents included Hughes Aircraft Co.  and the big engineering concern Fluor Corp. in Irvine.  </P> <P> Chevron Corp. of San Francisco said it had advised about 80 dependents of  employees -- who are on loan to the Saudi oil company, Saudi Aramco -- that  Chevron is ready to evacuate them.  </P> <P> Ray Silvius, a spokesman for Hughes in Los Angeles, said his company has fewer  than a dozen employees in Saudi Arabia, who advise the Saudi military. Family  members were being urged to leave because "what you don't want to do is take  chances."  </P> <P> A number of companies also said they were leaving it up to employees and family  members to decide whether to leave Saudi Arabia. Texaco, which has about 50  employees on loan to Saudi Aramco, said it was helping to make travel  arrangements for dependents wishing to leave. A Texaco spokesman said that  although employees weren't being ordered out of the country, "They have been  told that if they desire, they are free to leave." Dresser, too, said it left  the decision up to employees.  </P> <P> Ryan said Dresser employees had been notified that "if they think their safety  is at risk they are to exit as fast as they can by the best means they can."  </P> <P> The Associated Press reported that airports in Saudi Arabia appeared crowded  with foreigners attempting to leave the country.  </P> <P> Many American companies interviewed Wednesday cited concerns for the safety of  their employees and refused to provide details of the number working in Saudi  Arabia and neighboring countries or contingency plans to evacuate them.  </P> <P> Boeing Co., involved with a consortium of companies in maintaining the Saudi  "Peace Shield" AWACS early warning aircraft fleet, said employees and family  members based in Saudi Arabia but who were out of the country were advised not  to return. However, a Boeing spokesman in Seattle refused to say if an  evacuation is contemplated.  </P> <P> Other American firms with significant numbers of employees in Saudi Arabia but  which declined to discuss contingency plans Wednesday included Procter &amp;  Gamble, General Electric, Westinghouse Electric and Halliburton.  </P> <P> A General Electric spokesman said, "We are working closely with the State  Department to assure security, but to avoid compromising the safety of our  employees we are not commenting further."  </P> <P> Guy Marcus, a spokesman for Halliburton, an oil services company based in  Dallas, stressed that his company isn't contemplating a withdrawal from Saudi  Arabia. "We're not closing down operations," he said.  </P> <P> A State Department official said the number of U.S. citizens in Saudi Arabia is  about 24,000, not counting military personnel sent in over the past few days.  Of the 24,000, about 650 are U.S. government personnel and family members.  </P> <P> Unlike in Iraq and Kuwait, U.S. companies have heavy investments in Saudi  Arabia, and assets as well as employees may be threatened if war erupts. Most  U.S. assets in the country are in the form of joint ventures with Saudi  partners, in which U.S. companies own 50% or less. A large portion of U.S.  investment in Saudi Arabia is in processing plants and equipment related to  petroleum and petrochemicals.  </P> <P> Mobil, for example, has a 50% interest in a recently completed refinery, as  well as a petrochemical plant and a plant that blends motor lubricants. The  refinery, Yanbu Refinery on the Red Sea, north of Jidda, processes 125,000  barrels of oil per day.  </P> <P> A Commerce Department spokeswoman said that at the end of 1989, the total value  of U.S. direct investment in Saudi Arabia was $1.81 billion.  </P> <P> Saudi Arabia has also been an important destination for U.S. exports. Commerce  Department figures show that the United States has been Saudi Arabia's biggest  supplier of imports, with U.S. companies sending considerable quantities of  agricultural equipment, as well as air conditioning and refrigeration  machinery.  </P> <P> Scot J.

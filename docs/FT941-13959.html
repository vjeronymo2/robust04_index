			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Standard surges The upsurge in Standard Chartered shares continued unabated, with many brokers, but few marketmakers, taken aback by the speed of the latest upsurge. 'The marketmakers remain acutely short of stock and until this is unwound and the mistaken bid stories dissipate, the shares will continue to move up,' said one long-standing observer of the company. Standard is due to report preliminary results on March 9 and is expected by shrewd market observers to achieve pre-tax profits close to the top of the range, said to be between Pounds 360m and Pounds 450m. Talk of stakebuilding and bid stories are still regarded by the leading marketmakers as wide of the mark. Lloyds Bank, which retains a near 5 per cent from its mid-1980's tilt at the Standard, and at least one of the big Swiss banks, are said to have taken a hard and long look at Standard, who's Pacific Rim and African interests are the envy of the international banking community. Standard shares rocketed to a record 1360p, up 44 on the day and a massive 198 higher on the week. Turnover yesterday reached 1.5m shares. NatWest Securities was a strong supporter of Standard yesterday; 'Standard has underperformed by 3 per cent over the month, is trading on less than 10 times 1994 earnings and will see a sharp rise in both dividend cover and balance sheet ratios,' the broker said yesterday.</p>

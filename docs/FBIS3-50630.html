			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] San Cristobal de las Casas (Mexico), 4 Jan (DPA) --  The Mexican "zapatist" guerrillas who spectacularly began a  conflict in the southern State of Chiapas on 1 January plan a  long-term war to "exterminate capitalism and institute  socialism."    "We do not just want a change of government, we want to  exterminate the capitalist system and establish socialism as  many other countries have. We will not lay down our weapons for  any reason," said one of the commanders near the occupied area  of Ocosingo and Altamirano.    The so-called "Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN),"  which took its name from the legendary peasant guerrilla leader  Emiliano Zapata of the armed revolution of 1910-17, began on 1  January by occupying four important municipal capitals of  Chiapas State, one of Mexico's poorest and most underdeveloped  states. "We had waited many years for solutions to our  problems, many years of poverty and ignorance, and that is why  we decided to go to war," said the rebel commander who  identified himself simply as "Captain" of the EZLN, during a  conversation with journalists at one of the rebel road blocks on  the San Cristobal-Ocosingo road.    The insurgents first occupied San Cristobal de las Casas,  Las  Margaritas, Ocosingo, and Altamirano, but later left the first  two towns and fell back to the mountains of the so-called  chiapan highlands [altos chiapanecos], near the border with  Guatemala. The first clashes have left an unofficial tally of  100 dead and several dozen wounded. Even though when they left  San Cristobal De Las Casas they attacked an Army garrison near  the town, their initial tactic seemed to be to fall back from  the occupied areas without offering resistance to the Army in  order to strike other points in the region.    Another rebel commander, who identified himself with his nom  de guerre, "Lieutenant [teniente] Jesus," said that "the armed  struggle is the only path for changing the situation of  oppression and marginalization in which the indigenous persons  and peasants have been kept for 500 years." "For the poor, all  the legal paths have been closed for years," added "Lieutenant  Jesus, "a young man of 18 years of age who was in command of a  roadblock approximately 25 km from San Cristobal.    The insurgent group, whose existence was reported -- and  officially denied -- last May, has apparently existed for  several years. "On 1 January the war started, we declared war  on the enemy, but our organization had existed for many years,"  said the guerrilla "Captain." "At first there were the  guerrillas that only operated in the mountains, later it grew  and extended its field of operation. Peasants, teachers, and  workers joined the movement and that is how we formed the  Zapatist National Liberation Army," he said. Now -- he added --  "we are structured like an army, we have military ranks, as the  federal Army does, but we are different, we are an army of the  people, not of the bourgeoisie."    Witnesses said at lease 500 guerrillas participated in the  occupation of the four towns. They were armed with rifles,  handguns, knives, machetes, and automatic weapons such as  AK-47's and Mini-14s. Wearing military uniforms and with their  faces covered with ski caps or red handkerchiefs, they still  occupied on Monday night the towns of Ocosingo and Altamirano,  less than 100 km east of San Cristobal de las Casas. At Least  four roadblocks, placed by the rebels on the road, block the  access routes to Ocosingo and Altamirano.    "Lieutenant Jesus" said the EZLN is prepared for a long war.  "We will accept many casualties, but will never surrender our  weapons. We will continue the revolution until we win it with  the weapons in our hands. That is our objective," he stressed.</p>

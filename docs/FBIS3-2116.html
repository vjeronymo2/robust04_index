On behalf of  the regional party committee, people's congress standing  committee, people's government, and committee of the Chinese  People's Political Consultative Conference, I extend my  heartfelt regards and holiday greetings to the peasants,  herdsmen, workers, intellectuals, and comrades of all  nationalities across Tibet; PLA commanders and fighters  stationed in Tibet; officers and men as well as political and  law officers of Tibet People's Armed Police Corps; patriots from  of all nationalities and circles; and all of you here!  Meanwhile, I would like to express my warm greetings to Tibetan  people outside Tibet and my heartfelt gratitude and best wishes  to people at home and abroad who have shown their concern,  support, and offered assistance in Tibet's socialist  modernization drive!    Under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's  basic line in 1993, Tibet earnestly followed the guidelines of  the 14th CPC Congress and the fourth enlarged plenary session of  the fourth regional party committee and always made economic  construction its central task to launch a profound  antiseparatist struggle and the work for a stable situation.  Tibet closely adhered to the goal of establishing a socialist  market economic structure and seized the opportunity to deepen  reform and open wider to the outside world. With a united  struggle and the unremitting efforts of the party, government,  army, police, people, all nationalities, and all walks of life  in the region, Tibet has further developed the economy,  stablized its social situation, unified all nationalities, and  made new progress in various social undertakings. Tibet's  economy has particularly displayed a momentum for sustained,  rapid, and healthy development: Tibet achieved 3.65 billion  yuan in total output value of goods and services, up 8.1 percent  over the previous year in terms of comparable prices; this  includes 1.77 billion yuan achieved by primary industry, up 4.9  percent; 530 million yuan by secondary industry, up 16.6  percent; and 1.35 billion yuan by tertiary industry, up 9.5  percent. Tibet saw its sixth bumper harvest in agriculture and  steady economic growth in agricultural and pastoral areas, with  per capita net income of 515 yuan for peasants and herdsmen.  Industrial and transport enterprises improved their efficiency  and basically achieved simultaneous growth in production, sales,  and economic returns. Tibet's foreign trade thrived and tourism  maintained good momentun for development -- a substantial step  forward in opening up. The construction of infrastructure,  focusing on energy resources, transportation, and  telecommunications, proceeded smoothly. Localities improved  their economic strengthen and collected 149 million yuan in  revenue. Urban and rural markets were brisk, commodity prices  were basically stable, and people continued to improve their  living standards. New progress was also made in science,  technology, education, culture, public health, sports, and other  social undertakings. All of these encourages us to march  forward in the new year with full confidence.    The year 1994 is a crucial year for Tibet to continue the  establishment of a socialist market economy as well as an  important year to maintain good momentum for economic  development. This year, Tibet should make reform, development,  and stability its main theme in various kinds of work and  comprehensively implement the guidelines of the Third Plenary  Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, the fifth enlarged  plenary session of the 4th regional party committee, and the  regional economic work conference. Tibet should firmly adhere  to the central work of economic construction and strive to  advance the establishment of a socialist market economy, the  work of stabilizing the situation, and the construction of  socialist spiritual civilization.    Reform is the driving force of economic development. In  reforming Tibet's economic system, we should adhere to the  criterion of whether it will develop productive forces, seize  the opportune time, promote reform as a whole, stress the main  points, and keep our reform framework and structure in line with  those of the state. Taking Tibet's actual situation into  consideration, we should be firm in action, flexible in  policies, and stable in process. This year, Tibet's reform is  arduous because it requires greater efforts, wider range, and  better quality. Therefore, we must adhere to investigation and  study, extensively solicit opinions, and seek perfection through  scientific ways in making reform policies and make sure that we  have well-conceived plans, meticulous organization, and earnest  practice. Reform measures involving the immediate interests of  the people must go through assessment, coordination,  experimentation, and other effective ways. Reform will surely  touch or break old systems, economic relations, and the  structure of interests, and will produce new contradictions,  problems, and difficulties. Party committees and people's  governments at various levels should work diligently and  initiate and implement various important reform measures in a  down-to-earth manner on the one hand; people of all  nationalities and circles should, one the other hand, attach  importance to the overall situation, take overall and long-term  interests into consideration, consciously support and engage in  the cause of reform, and make sure that Tibet will make  breakthrough progress in various reforms this year through the  concerted efforts of all sectors and all walks of life across  the region.    Development is the last word. It is the common aspiration of  all nationalities as well as our central work for maintaining  sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development and developin  Tibet's economy as soon as possible. Therefore, we should  continue to broaden our minds for economic development,  strengthen and improve macroeconomic regulation and control,  make greater efforts to restructure the economy, and achieve the  integration of rapid development and higher economic efficiency.  This year's economic work should center on increasing the  income of peasants and herdsmen and vigorously developing the  economy in the agricultural and pastoral areas, while stepping  up the pace of reform; increase enterprises' economic returns as  a whole with the focus on further changing state enterprises'  operating mechanisms; actively create new factors for economic  growth under the guidance of industrial policies; and continue  to implement the strategy of revitalizing Tibet with science and  education with a view to improving labor quality and the level  of productive forces. We should concentrate our efforts on  economic development and make sure that Tibet's economy grows at  a rate of 8 percent this year.    The maintenance of social stability is the prerequisite for  smooth progress in reform, opening up, and economic development.  We must bear in mind Comrade Deng Xiaoping's dictum that  "stability is of overriding importance;" correctly understand  and handle the relationship between reform, development, and  stability; and correctly understand and handle contradictions of  the two different natures. Splittist activities are the major  factor undermining Tibet's social and political situation; and  they pose the gravest obstacle to the region's reform and  development. Therefore, we must always adhere to the principle  of grasping two links at the same time, resolutely cracking  down, according to the law, on hostile elements who try to split  the motherland and stir up trouble to the detriment of  stability, while continuing to strike swiftly and severely in  accordance with the law, at serious criminal offenders and  economic criminals who disrupt and interfere with reform,  development, and social stability. Meanwhile, under the  circumstances of expediting reform and opening up and of  changing to the new system from the old, and in the process of  establishing a socialist market economy, there will certainly be  changes cropping up in social contradictions and new features in  the contradictions among the people. We must pay strict  attention to contradictions among the people in the new era, and  familiarize ourselves with the policy, strategy, and correct  methods for handling contradictions among them. Leading cadres  at all levels should set a good example in intensifying  investigation and study, improving work style, putting the  interests of the people above anything else, and overcoming  bureaucratism, formalism, and other unhealthy practices. They  should go down to the grass roots, mingle with the masses, and  work on the frontline of production to solve problems on the  spot. They should visit problem spots to understand public  feelings, localities with newly emerging things and changes to  sum up experiences, and backward areas to open up a new  situation in work. In a nutshell, they should deliver the kind  concern of the party and the government to every household. At  present, particular attention must be paid to helping  poverty-stricken peasants and herdsmen, workers of  deficit-ridden enterprises, retirees, and various categories of  recipients of government aid solve practical problems and do  everything possible to provide arrangements for their production  and everyday life. Only by so doing will the people support the  policies of the party and the government even more, give us  greater trust, and take the initiative to help and coordinate  with us in handling various social contradictions and problems  and will they join us in consolidating and developing the  excellent situation characterized by stability and unity in  Tibet.    Comrades, friends: Accelerating reform, promoting reform,  and ensuring stability are the three major tasks of Tibet's work  in 1994, whose accomplishment is dependent upon joint struggle  by all party, government, army, and armed police organizations  and the people of all nationalities and in all circles  throughout the region. We must rally more closely around the  party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the nucleur,  grasp the overall situation in the light of the theory of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's  basic line, seize the historic opportunity, heighten our spirit,  and advance courageously in unity to greet the 30th anniversary  of the establishment of the autonomous region with outstanding  achievements.    In conclusion, once again may all of you as well as the  people of all nationalities and in all circles across Tibet have  a happy new year!</p>

Grigory Karasin, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman,  said at a Moscow briefing Thursday that armed terror had been  and would be dealt with resolutely.    He said that the recent killings of Russian servicemen and  ethnic Russians in Tajikistan was the work of those who did not  want peace and stability in that country.    Karasin also said that at its emergency meeting the Tajik  government had decided to take up numerous steps to protect the  Russians and the residents of the Tajik capital. Round the  clock patrolling had been introduced in areas inhabited by  Russians. Investigation teams in which military prosecutors are  represented have been set up.</p>

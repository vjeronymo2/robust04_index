			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: BBC maintained links with Tom Thumb film Sir, Nigel Andrews's review of the film The Secret Adventures of Tom Thumb (December 9) contains an allegation against the BBC which has no basis in fact. 'Having funded the project,' says Mr Andrews, 'Auntie then shelved it in horror until the film got loose and started to win festival prizes.' I commissioned The Secret Adventures as a development of a 10-minute pilot film made in-house at BBC Bristol, and I maintained a close relationship with it through script development, production and post-production. In June, I accompanied the production team to the film's premiere at the Annecy Animation Festival and shared their pleasure at its enthusiastic reception. We are very pleased with the film and at no point has it been 'shelved'. It was always intended for a prominent transmission placing, and, having waited just six months for an appropriate slot in the schedules, it will be broadcast on BBC 2 at 9.30pm on December 23.

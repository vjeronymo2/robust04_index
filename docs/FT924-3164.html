			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Eurocopy falls 76% to Pounds 1.7m PRE-TAX PROFITS at Eurocopy fell 76 per cent to Pounds 1.7m in the year to end-September, as the office equipment distributor struggled to repair the damage resulting from adverse publicity over sales practices at a Scottish subsidiary. For the first four months Eurocopy had been under investigation by the Office of Fair Trading - it was eventually cleared - and the remaining eight months were 'perhaps the worst in living memory,' Mr Michael Armitage, finance director, said. Efforts to rebuild sales, which melted largely due to the inquiry, had been thwarted by recession. Turnover for the 12 months to September 30 declined by 22 per cent to Pounds 34.2m. Hardest hit had been the machine sales division, which accounted for some Pounds 5m of the decline in group turnover. This business incurred a loss of Pounds 4.5m. The group's struggling furniture business suffered a loss of Pounds 1m during the year. Eurocopy is reviewing several options for this operation and a decision is expected soon. Eurocopy's servicing operations suffered from a decline in copy volumes. The company had taken action to cut costs, including a 19 per cent reduction in employee numbers. It was estimated that annual savings would be about Pounds 1m. The dividend was cut by 2.4p to 0.5p for a total of 1.6p (4p). Earnings per share tumbled from 9.49p to 2.32p. COMMENT Eurocopy has truly had an 'annus horribilis'. Yet with this set of results, one might hope that things can only get better. Still, it will be a long, hard slog to rebuild business, particularly in Scotland where the losses ran to Pounds 1m. This is a group which truly needs economic recovery. Short of that, Eurocopy should benefit from cost cutting. Analysts are forecasting about Pounds 2.5m for this year, based on flat servicing profits and reduced losses in machine sales. If the company does something about the furniture division, then profits could be as much as Pounds 500,000 better. The prospective p/e of 11 leaves the shares fairly valued in the short-term. However, economic recovery could change the whole ballgame on a longer-term basis.</p>

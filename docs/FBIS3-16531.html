Simonenko; from the "Vesti" newscast] </F>   [Text] Staff at Kursk nuclear power station are threatening  to go on hunger strike, boycott the oblast Duma elections, and  cut off the current to the power lines and so cause problems in  the unified power grid unless debts are paid off. The nuclear  power industry workers are demanding that around 86 billion  rubles owed for electricity already supplied and three-month  wage arrears are paid. These demands have been sent to the  Russian Government by a joint decision of the station's  management board and labor collective councils. The deadline  set for meeting these demands is 10 March. But even right now  the total capacity of the station's four power units is down by  50 percent. Nuclear fuel reserves at the Kursk nuclear power  station are running out. Suppliers are unwilling to deliver  without payment. For the time being Kursk power station workers  are working without pay. The station's safe and reliable  operation is nonetheless guaranteed. Nuclear energy, even when  used for peaceful purposes, must not be tinkered with. But  staff are ready to shut down the station.</p>

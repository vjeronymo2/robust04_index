			<p>920324 FT  24 MAR 92 / The FT Review of Business Books (4): The changing world of competition RIVAL STATES, RIVAL FIRMS: COMPETTION FOR WORLD MARKET SHARES by John Stopford and Susan Strange Cambridge, 321 pages THIS BOOK is the result of an unusual collaboration by two eminent specialists. Stopford is a leading business school researcher, while Strange is well known for her publications on international relations. They have taken on the subject of the relations between multinationals and governments in developing countries, covering under this heading the gamut of topics from technical change and development strategy to the nitty gritty of decision making in business and bargaining with officials. The setting is apt. World flows of foreign direct investment (FDI)are booming. After a slackening of activity in the early 1980s, a sustained burst of energy and optimism has seized the multinationals. Their international activity is now spreading faster than world trade or production. The increasing share of global industry and services accounted for by MNCs is regarded with welcome rather than resentment or fear by most governments in the developing countries. The growing pace of technical change, along with revolutionary improvements in transport, communications and financial markets, binds all countries closer together in a web of competition and cooperation, with MNCs among the leading players, While these are not new trends, the current boom in FDI differs in several ways from that in the 60s and 70s. The US, once the largest net exporter of capital, is now the largest recipient. There are several major new players in the world league, from Japan, Europe and even the developing countries. However, the share of FDl going to developing countries, once rising, is now declining, and the real value of flows to them in 1989-90 was lower than a dozen years previously The flows have also changed direction and become more concentrated. Just when governments are clamouring for more FDI, the investors, driven by the needs of global competition and the search for efficient locations (with skilled labour, good infrastructure,reliable local suppliers and conducive legal environments), are focusing on the relatively advanced countries in East and South-east Asia. Success in attracting FDl is, in other words, directly linked with success in industrial strategy more generally, one reinforcing the other. What then accounts for the success of East Asia, in particular for the historically unprecedented growth and Industrial prowess of Korea and Taiwan? A common perception is that they developed' by pursuing liberal market-oriented policies and relying heavily on MNCs. This simple view is unrealistic and misleading. Markets are never as efficient as theories make out, and in developing countries they are very prone to 'failure'. The success of Korea and Taiwan is due to the pervasive and prolonged interventions they undertook to remedy such failures, by building up education, protecting infant industries, fostering indigenous technological activity, setting up numerous institutions, and promoting local enterprise by restricting foreign entry. They were certainly export oriented,and the pattern oftheir interventions differed radically from that in most other developing countries- but they intervened nonetheless. If they are the role models, governments retain the central role in development. They can still be the guardians of national interest rather than a collection of bumbling, corrupt bureaucrats. This is the view taken by the authors of this book. They debunk many of the simplistic notions that seem to pervade much of development thinking. They survey evidence from a range of firms and from three countries (Brazil, Kenya and Malaysia) to illustrate how complex,even bewildering, is the real world of decision making in politics and business, and how difficult it is to define ideal strategies. They stress the fundamentals of economic progress (the chapter by Henley is very good) and emphasise how technological change calls for human resource development and astute, flexible policy responses by governments. They do not directly address the issue of optimal interventions, but that may be because they do not see a generalisable pattern of policies for diverse countries. In their view, governments and MNCs have much to gain from each other. However, their relations are not always complementary. It is inherent in the nature of the phenomenon that conflicts of interest can arise between MNCs and developing countries, and it is only governments that can resolve them. In the past the resolution has often been biased and harmful, and better understanding of technological realities and business can help to improve policy making in the future. The book closes with many sensible suggestions for both parties.</p>

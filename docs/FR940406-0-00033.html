In the absence of a position at the same grade level, an offer of reassignment to a vacant position at the highest available grade level below the employee's current grade level shall be made, but availability of such a vacancy shall not affect the employee's entitlement, if any, to disability retirement pursuant to any retirement plan in which the employee is enrolled. If the Board has already posted a notice or announcement seeking applications for a specific vacant position at the time the Board has determined that the nonprobationary employee is unable to perform the essential functions of his or her position even with reasonable accommodation, then the Board does not have an obligation under this section to offer to reassign the individual to that position, but the Board shall consider the individual on an equal basis with those who applied for the position.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Exclusion from definition of ``individual with a disability'' <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _(1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Illegal use of drugs. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (i) The term ``individual with a disability'' shall not include an individual who is currently engaging in the illegal use of drugs, when the Board acts on the basis of such use.

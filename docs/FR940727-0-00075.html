A military member authorized to appear as a witness for the United States, including those authorized to appear under &sect;516.55(d), will be placed on temporary duty. If USAR or NG personnel are requested as witnesses for the United States, and if their testimony arises from their active duty service, they should be placed on active duty to testify. The status of a civilian employee will be determined under Federal Personnel Manual 630, subchapter 10. DA personnel who appear as necessary witnesses for a party asserting the government's claim for medical care expenses are witnesses for the United States. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Travel arrangements. Travel arrangements for witnesses for the United States normally are made by DOJ through Litigation Division for other than local travel. Litigation Division will issue instructions for this travel, including fund citation, to the appropriate commander. A U.S. Attorney, or an attorney asserting the government's medical care claim under Subpart E, may make arrangements for local travel through the SJA or legal adviser for attendance of a witness who is stationed at an installation within the same judicial district, or not more than 100 miles from the place where testifying. Other requests, including those under &sect;516.55(d), will be referred to Litigation Division. The instructions from Litigation Division, or the request from the U.S. Attorney or the attorney asserting the government's claim, will serve as a basis for the issuance of appropriate travel orders by the local commander. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Travel and per diem expenses. The witness' commander or supervisor should ensure the witness has sufficient funds to defray expenses. The SJA or legal adviser will provide assistance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Where local travel is performed at the request of a U.S. Attorney and the testimony does not involve information acquired in the performance of duties, transportation arrangements and any per diem expenses are the responsibility of the U.S. Attorney. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) An attorney asserting the government's medical care or property claim may be required to advance local travel expense money to the witness requested and to include these in recoverable costs where the government's claim is not large enough to justify expenditures of government travel funds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Other local travel and per diem expense for cases involving Army activities or claims are proper expenses of the command issuing the orders. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Litigation Division will furnish travel expense and per diem funds for other than local travel and will receive reimbursement from DOJ or other government agencies as appropriate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;516.55 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 -->  Witnesses for a state or private litigant. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Status of witness. If authorized to appear as a witness for a state or private litigant, and the testimony to be given relates to information obtained in the performance of official duties, a military member will attend in a permissive TDY status. If authorized to appear as a witness, but the testimony does not relate to information obtained in the performance of official duties, a military member may be granted a pass or permissive TDY under AR 630&hyph;5, or be required to take ordinary leave. The status of a civilian employee will be determined under 5 CFR Chapter I. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Travel arrangements. The requesting party or state agency will make all travel arrangements for attendance of DA personnel authorized to appear as witnesses for a state or private litigant. The local commander may issue appropriate orders when necessary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Travel expenses. The United States may not pay travel, meals, and lodging expenses of the witness, other than normal allowances for subsistence pursuant to the DOD Military Pay and Allowances Entitlements Manual. These expenses are solely a matter between the witness and the party seeking his appearance. Witnesses ordinarily should be advised to require advance payment of such expenses. Military personnel authorized to appear in a pass or permissive TDY status are not entitled to receive witness attendance fees, but may accept travel, meals, and lodging expense money from the requesting litigant. All witness fees tendered the military member, to the extent they exceed such actual expenses of the member, will be remitted to the Treasurer of the United States. A civilian employee authorized to appear in his or her official capacity will accept the authorized witness fees, in addition to the allowance for travel and subsistence, and make disposition of the witness fees as instructed by his or her personnel office. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

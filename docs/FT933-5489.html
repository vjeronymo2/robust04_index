			<p>930903 FT  03 SEP 93 / China crows over 'poison cargo' China yesterday claimed victory over the US following a bitter argument about the cargo on board a Chinese ship bound for the Middle East. Washington had alleged that the vessel was transporting chemicals to Iran for weapons production, Tony Walker reports from Beijing. Wu Jianmin, foreign ministry spokesman, told reporters that a team, including Chinese and Saudi technical experts had conducted an inspection and found no evidence of the chemicals on board - thiodyglycol and thionyl chloride. The US, whose naval vessels had interrupted the Yin He's passage through the Gulf, had claimed the Chinese ship was transporting chemical 'precursors' to the Iranian port of Bandar Abbas for use in the manufacture of mustard and nerve gas. Wu said the inspection was conducted at Dammam in Saudi Arabia in the presence of 'personnel dispatched by the United States' who served as 'technical advisers' to the Saudis.</p>

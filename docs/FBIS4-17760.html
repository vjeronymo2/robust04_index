			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Tatyana Morozova report: "Another Center. A Right-Wing </F> One This Time"]    [Text] Another sociopolitical patriotic movement has  appeared in Russia, the "All-Russia National Right-Wing Center."    Orthodox people and nonbelievers, monarchists and supporters  of other social systems, and politicians and representatives of  social thought have gathered together, turning aside from  private political tasks and personal interests.    "We have united with the aim of overcoming the idea  instilled  in the public awareness as to the apparent incompatibility of  the revival of Russian national values based on Orthodox ethics  and the idea of the legal and social development of society,"  Mikhail Astafyev, chairman of the new movement, said.    At a press conference it was noted that the demographic  disaster which the Russian people are now experiencing means  that within 50 years the country's population will be halved,  and we will be able to talk of the historical end of Russia and  an imminent geopolitical repartition of an enormous part of the  world.    The center's tasks include striving to end the insulting  plundering of national resources under the guise of monstrous,  thieving forms of privatization. Crime, which is eating away at  the economy, state structures, and the law enforcement organs,  can be rooted out only by means of uncompromising emergency  legislation.</p>

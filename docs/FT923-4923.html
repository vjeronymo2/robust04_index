			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / Survey of Distribution Services (10): Drive for greater efficiency - look at new challenges facing companies in Europe EFFORTS by European producers of industrial and consumer goods to rationalise manufacturing strategies and to increase competitiveness are presenting logistics and distribution providers with new domestic and international challenges. British Steel is aware of the stiff competition it faces in its planned assault on European mainland markets. Physical distribution is an important plank in its campaign and the costs and efficiency of the service will help determine the success or failure of the venture. The company is engaged in a far-reaching review of its transportation and delivery operations. High on the agenda for discussion is the setting up of regional distribution centres closer to customers and the development of world class information technology (IT) links between production plants, distribution operators and customers. Meanwhile, the company spends some Pounds 375m a year on shipping products to mainland Europe and tends to deal direct with transport operators and suppliers rather than go through forwarding agents. Its sales in Europe represent about 2.5 per cent of the total European market and the objective is to achieve significant increases. Its main European destinations are Italy, Germany and Spain, followed by France, Greece and the Netherlands. Short sea vessels under 4,000 tonnes dwt are the main mode British Steel uses to ship products to the mainland, some 64 per cent of the total. Last year the vessels carried 1.8m tonnes. The use of sea vessels able to negotiate river and canal systems allows British Steel to deliver direct to Duisburg, Paris, Lyons and Bonn without the need for transhipment and double handling. Mr Patrick Doolan, British Steel director for supplies and transport, a confirmed ship user, concedes the mode faces strong competition from rail. It depends on whether investment occurs in rolling stock and systems on the same scale as for ships. At present 11 per cent of British Steel's European deliveries are by rail and 4 per cent by combined transport. All British Steel's main works are rail connected as are most of its large customers. It uses Railfreight Distribution's (RfD) conventional wagon train ferry service to France, and, to a limited degree, United Transport's (UT) lift-on/lift-off intermodal units which sail between Hull and Tilbury and Rotterdam on UT ships. Mr Doolan is unhappy with uncompetitive railway rates, the critical shortage of rail wagons and British Rail's inability to come up with a design for a single wagon to carry the 24 metre beams which British Steel wants to market to the continental construction industry. He has a limited degree of interest in the Channel Tunnel, arguing that much of its business is not sufficiently time-sensitive to warrant it. Twenty-one per cent of British Steel's deliveries to Europe go by road. P &amp; O Ferrymasters is British Steel's main supplier of roll-on/roll-off trailers services to the continent. Hauliers have to meet stiff equipment specifications - coil-carrying trailers must have air suspension, rubber-lined wells and a protective tarpaulin covering. Mr Doolan recognises the importance of a partnership between British Steel and its suppliers but insists on maintaining competition between contractors by sharing cargo between different routes. TNT Contract Logistics is developing a special trailer to make its distribution of car parts to General Motors' assembly plant at Uusikaupunki, Finland, more cost-effective. Using a combination of covered trailers and rail, TNT delivers 400 tonnes of parts a day from Frankfurt. For the back load only 40 per cent of space is filled with returning empty packaging. TNT has to turn to the open market to fill the rest. The new trailer has been designed with an hydraulic scissor platform which allows TNT to convert it into a double-deck transporter that can be used on the return journey to carry finished cars. German forwarder Kuhne &amp; Nagel (K &amp; N) first became involved in distribution 25 years ago when its client, Tschi Bo, asked it to organise the distribution of coffee beans whose import it had arranged. Now K &amp; N organises the roasting of the beans in Berlin and the delivery by road to 5,000 specialist retail outlets throughout Germany. Today, the company also carries out European distribution for Gillette and Phillip Morris. K &amp; N, an established international forwarder with 350 offices in more than 60 countries, recognised the logistics opportunities emerging in Europe and set up a specialist logistics department in Switzerland. It acquired companies in Holland and Italy, countries which it identified as offering areas of opportunity. These acquisitions, together with its 12 existing common-user warehouses in Germany, give the company a strong base for domestic and intra-European services, said Mr Peter Dohne, head of European logistics. Alert to the re-emergence of rail as a significant freight transport mode, a main board member has now been given responsibility for developing rail services. The company's Paris office regularly uses the SNCF high-speed temperature-controlled rail service for perishable goods between Paris and Marseilles. Distribution has become a critical factor in Europe's paper industry. Manufacturers, suffering from a decline in demand and the dumping from overseas of cut-price products, look to logistics to reduce costs and to increase efficiency. It is a buyer's market where the manufacturers expect their distribution specialists to develop supply systems that result in zero damage and avoid customers the penalty of holding costly a inventory. St Regis, a leading UK producer of paper for packaging, exports some 140,000 tonnes a year to Europe. Its customers in the Benelux countries and northern France expect orders to be delivered within 24 hours. To meet this demand the company is setting up down-the-line warehouses to hold stock closer to the customers and thus speed up delivery reaction time. Third party contractors will be asked to provide and manage the warehouses. In an enterprising attempt to further develop the European market, logistics contractor, TDG, has launched a company providing would-be exporters from the US and the Far East with a start-up service for entering Europe As well as providing normal distribution services, the market development and management services offered by Prism include business planning, customs, tax handling, sales management, marketing and credit control. Commented John Cole, head of TDG's distribution division; 'The service helps potential exporters avoid any heavy investment risk. It provides us with the chance to create a partnership with a new client.'</p>

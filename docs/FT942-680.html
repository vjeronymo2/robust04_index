			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Coffee price soars after Brazil frost Coffee futures prices soared by nearly 40 per cent to a 7 1/2 -year high in London yesterday following reports that frost and cold winds had damaged about a quarter of the coffee trees in Brazil, the world's largest producer. Manufacturers warned that consumers faced further price rises in the autumn if the surge in the coffee market, up 140 per cent so far this year, continued. 'This current situation of prices going up and up and up cannot prevail for ever without us having to consider when we pass that on to the consumer,' said Mr Mick Casey of Nestle. The price of Nescafe, which has 40 per cent of the UK instant coffee market, rose 12 1/2 per cent in January, its first increase in four years, but consumption was not affected, Mr Casey said. 'The price of green beans takes four to five months to filter through to supermarket prices,' he added. The weekend frost damage in Brazil, coupled with forecasts of more to come, sent London robusta futures prices into one of their biggest single-day rises. The contract for coffee for delivery in September rose to a peak of Dollars 3,150 a tonne, up 39.7 per cent on Friday's close. The cold snap, which comes at the start of a six-week period when Brazilian crops are vulnerable to frost, gave fresh impetus to a bullish market. Prices have been lifted from last year's low of about Dollars 800 a tonne by a producers' agreement to withhold exports, which has coincided with a shortage of coffee supplies and falling consumer stocks. Yesterday's gains were trimmed by profit-taking, but the contract still ended Dollars 593 higher at Dollars 2,848 a tonne. The surge was mirrored in arabica coffee futures in New York where the September contract closed up 33.5 cents a pound at 161.6 cents a pound. Most of the frost damage was in the Brazil's southern state of Parana, where up to 70 per cent of coffee trees were affected. Commodities, Page 30</p>

			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / Selling bottled dreams at a discount: An unpleasant fragrance in the perfume industry An unseemly outbreak of bargain basement competition in Britain's Pounds 600m-a-year fragrance market is sending ripples of apprehension through the rarefied world of the luxury perfume industry. Leading perfume houses have long commanded sky-high prices for products which cost almost nothing to make by spending lavishly on marketing and promotion calculated to create an aura of glamour and exclusivity. As one industry executive candidly admits, the business is about selling dreams in a bottle. However, the highly profitable industry is increasingly threatened by heavy discounting in the UK, where unauthorised distributors are selling top brands such as Anais Anais, Chanel No. 5 and Opium for as much as 60 per cent less than the recommended price. Price-cutting was initiated by two small retail chains, the Glasgow-based What Everyone Wants and Eau Zone, which operates eight outlets. It has now been joined by three heavyweight store groups, Littlewoods, the Superdrug chemists chain, and Tesco. Most of the companies - except Tesco, which declines to comment - report strong sales. Their success has compelled some authorised distributors, which have all previously charged similar prices for perfumes, to respond. For instance, the John Lewis Partnership is matching discount prices at selected stores. The discounters are coy about their supply sources but are believed to buy from middlemen on the international 'grey' market. The big perfume houses are seeking strenuously to trace and plug the leaks. 'We are concerned. We have spent a lot of time trying to minimise the grey market, but we have not been able to police it completely,' says a spokesman for L'Oreal, the French cosmetics company which is the UK perfume market leader. Some manufacturers are now said to be experimenting with invisible package markings which would identify the source of illicit supplies. Critics argue that the perfume industry is out to protect immoderate profit margins. 'At the end of the day there is a cartel, and it is looking to control retail prices,' says Mr Philip Green, chairman of Amber Day, which owns What Everyone Wants. The manufacturers vehemently deny such accusations, insisting they only want to ensure that retailers meet specified standards. 'In marketing up-market products, we provide support and services which obviously cost a lot of money,' says L'Oreal. 'If the products are sold in a non-quality environment, over a period of time there is a cheapening effect.' A new front in the skirmishing has recently been opened up by Kingfisher, Superdrug's parent company, which also owns the Woolworth and B&amp;Q chains. It is threatening to involve UK and European Community competition authorities in an attempt to force manufacturers to supply it directly. Superdrug currently sells perfumes, at discounts of up to 30 per cent, at two outlets in Newcastle and Epsom, Surrey. It believes that by expanding distribution to its 650 chemists' stores nationwide, it could quickly capture 10-20 per cent of the market. That compares with the 35 per cent held by Boots, the market leader. Mr Tim Clement-Jones, Kingfisher's company secretary, says direct supply would be both cheaper and more reliable than buying on the grey market, enabling Superdrug to raise its margins on perfume lines to 37 per cent from 27 per cent. The company is basing its campaign on new distribution agreements negotiated recently by the European Commission with Givenchy and Yves Saint Laurent. The agreements, expected to become a model for the industry, allow perfume houses to limit distribution to outlets which offer satisfactory service and quality standards, but require that retailers be left free to set their own prices. Kingfisher, which claims its two Superdrug outlets meet the EC criteria, has set out to test the regulations by inviting 25 leading perfume houses to supply it. So far only one, unnamed, manufacturer has offered to do so. Still, the campaign has won a small moral victory. Superdrug says Givenchy has agreed to inspect its Newcastle and Epsom stores with a view to considering them as authorised distributors. As Superdrug points out with some relish, that marks an apparent volte-face by the French company. Only last year Mr Peter Norman, its UK managing director was reported to have said that it would be 'appalling' if Givenchy perfumes were sold by the chain. Kingfisher has been working closely for some time with the Office of Fair Trading and has also been in touch with the Brussels Commission. Last week, the company turned over copies of its correspondence with the perfume houses to the OFT, which has agreed to look into the matter. If the campaign develops into a legal battle, much will hinge on the interpretation of the EC agreements, which have yet to be tested in the courts. But there is little doubt that if Kingfisher won, the price-cutting door would be opened wide to others, in Britain and elsewhere in Europe. Mr Green says that What Everything Wants plans to seek direct supplies shortly, while Kingfisher's campaign is also being followed closely by several large continental retailers, including Tengelmann of Germany and Ahold of the Netherlands. The stakes for the perfume houses are high. Mr Peter McDougall, an analyst at BZW, the London securities house, argues that the spread of discounting threatens to plunge the industry into a vicious circle from which it would be difficult to escape. 'The more expensive a perfume is, the more exclusive it becomes, and the more it attracts discounting, which erodes the exclusive image,' he says. 'The impact will be to shorten products' life cycles. 'That would mean the death of eternal brands like Chanel No. 5, which have been around for decades.'</p>

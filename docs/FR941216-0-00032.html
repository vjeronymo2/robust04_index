			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Previous Federal Action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The arroyo toad was first included by the Service as a category 2  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> candidate species in the September 18, 1985, Notice of Review of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Vertebrate Wildlife (50 FR 37958). Category 2 applies to taxa for which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information now in the possession of the Service indicates that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposing to list as endangered or threatened is possibly appropriate,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> but for which conclusive data on biological vulnerability and threat are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not currently available to support proposed rules. The subspecies also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was included as a category 2 candidate in the January 6, 1989, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> November 21, 1991, Animal Notices of Review (54 FR 554 and 56 FR 58804,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respectively). After publication of the most recent Notice of Review,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Service obtained substantial information on the biological  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vulnerability and the environmental threats to elevate this species to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> category 1. Category 1 species are those for which the Service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possesses sufficient data to support proposals for listing. Most of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> new information and analyses came from Dr. Samuel Sweet, University of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> California, Santa Barbara; Dr. Mark Jennings, California Academy of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sciences; and staff of the Los Padres National Forest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On December 30, 1992, (not January 12, 1993, as indicated in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed rule (58 FR 41232)) the Service received a petition from Dr.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sweet and Dr. Mark Jennings to list the arroyo toad as endangered (Sweet  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and Jennings 1992). Section 4(b)(3)(A) of the Endangered Species Act of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1973 (Act), as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), requires to the maximum  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extent practicable, that the Secretary make a finding within 90 days of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receipt of a petition, as to whether or not substantial information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicates the requested action may be warranted. If such a finding is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> made, the Service is directed to commence a review of the status of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> species. Within 12 months of receipt of a petition found to present  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substantial information, the Secretary is further directed to make a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> finding that the petitioned action is warranted, not warranted, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> warranted but precluded. In this instance, the preparation of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed rule was nearly complete at the time the petition was received,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> thus alleviating the need to commence the status review that the Service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would typically start in response to a petition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On August 3, 1993, the Service published a proposed rule in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (58 FR 41231) to list the arroyo toad as endangered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> That proposal was based primarily on information provided by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> petitioners, published literature, and contacts with various  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> herpetologists.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Summary of Comments and Recommendations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the August 3, 1993, proposed rule and associated notifications  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all interested parties were requested to submit factual reports or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information relevant to a final decision on the listing proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appropriate state agencies, county governments, Federal agencies,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scientific organizations, and other interested parties were contacted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and requested to comment. Notice of the publication of the proposal was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Santa Barbara News Press <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Los Angeles Times <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , and the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> San Diego Union Tribune <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Requests for a public hearing were received  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from four parties: the California Cattlemen's Association, the Newhall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Land and Farming Company, Public Lands for the People, and United Water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Conservation District. On September 9, 1993, the Service published a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  announcing the hearing and extending the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comment period until October 15, 1993 (58 FR 47428). The Service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conducted a hearing on October 4, 1993, at the Minerals Management  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Service in Camarillo, California. Thirteen parties presented testimony.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During the comment period, the Service received written and oral  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments from 27 parties, including those of three Federal agencies,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> three State agencies, and 19 individuals or groups. The Santa Monica  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mountains National Recreation Area (National Park Service), U.S. Forest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Service, the U.S. National Biological Survey's National Ecology Research  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Center, Southwestern Herpetologists Society, Keep the Sespe Wild  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Committee, and the Environmental Defense Center were some of the eight  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters expressing support for the listing proposal. Sixteen  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters opposed the listing of the arroyo toad. Eight were neutral  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the proposal but offered clarification or additional information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Written and oral statements obtained during the public hearing and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comment period are combined in the following discussion. In addition,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information submitted by the commenters, including updated locality and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> population data from the Cleveland, San Bernardino, and Los Padres  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> National Forests, has been incorporated into this final rule. Opposing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments and other comments questioning the rule have been organized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> into specific issues. These issues and the Service's response to each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are summarized as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Issue 1:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One of the petitioners noted that the common name for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> species,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Bufo microscaphus <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , is southwestern toad, whereas the common  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> name of the subspecies,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> B. microscaphus californicus <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , is arroyo toad.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the proposed rule the Service referred to  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> B. microscaphus  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> californicus <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  as the arroyo southwestern toad.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service acknowledges the nomenclatural  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> confusion in the proposed rule. The Service prefers to utilize common  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> names of subspecies that also reflect the species to which it is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> presently assigned; such usage allows the general public to find  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information on both the full species and the listed subspecies. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> common name of the subspecies appears as the ``arroyo southwestern  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> toad'' in the rule but is usually referred to as the ``arroyo toad'' in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the preamble text.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Issue 2:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters believed that there was insufficient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scientific evidence to list the arroyo toad; that all the data on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> species came from a single ``biased'' source; and that more studies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be conducted before a final decision on listing could be made.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

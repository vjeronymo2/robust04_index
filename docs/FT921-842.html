			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / Election 1992: CBI speaks out against Labour THE Confederation of British Industry abandoned any pretence of political neutrality yesterday by claiming that a Labour government would damage confidence, deepen recession and lead many big employers to postpone investment plans. In an open letter to its member companies, the organisation said that 'in the clamour of the election campaign' there was a danger that the electorate would overlook the huge improvement in the performance of British business under the Conservative party. The letter listed several policies - all of them Labour's - which the CBI said would jeopardise further improvement for business. They included: the national minimum wage, which the CBI says would cost 150,000 jobs; increasing tax on middle managers; and the renationalising of companies now in the private sector. At a press conference, Sir John Banham, CBI director general, said: 'Confidence is the key for the economy and there are proposals on the table (from Labour), including increasing tax on middle managers, that would have an adverse effect on confidence and house values.' CBI officials were also highly critical of the Labour party's election brochure on manufacturing industry which, they said, did not mention exports or productivity. Professor Doug MacWilliams, a CBI economic adviser, said that many CBI members had been reporting that a Labour victory would lead to the postponement or abandonment of investment plans because of the uncertain impact on demand of a sharp increase in taxation for upper income groups. Sir Brian Corby, CBI president, admitted that Labour's policy on capital allowances for industry was better than no policy on capital allowances - which is the Conservative position. The CBI is also closer to the Labour party on plans to strengthen the Department of Trade and Industry. The CBI expressed some criticism of the Conservative record, especially in education, transport, and public borrowing. However, Sir John said that Labour had no better solutions in transport because it was opposed to new road building.</p>

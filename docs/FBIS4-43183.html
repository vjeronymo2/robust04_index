			<p>BFN     [Text] A short time ago, a Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation  correspondent reported from Luxembourg that the European Union  [EU] Council of Foreign Ministers has approved a joint statement  on the Cyprus issue. In their statement the 12 ministers blame  the Turkish Cypriot side for the failure of the talks and plan  to discuss the Cyprus issue at the EU summit in Corfu.

Denisenko and O.A. Stetsenko; UDC </F> 621.391.81]    [Abstract] Both spectral and correlation characteristics of  nonlinearly frequency-modulated pulse signals are  comprehensively examined, nonlinear rather than linear frequency  modulation being necessary for perfect shaping of compressed  signals. For specificity are considered a pulse signal u(t)= Re  [U(t)exp(j_o_[.sub]0[/]t)] and power-law frequency modulation  _o_(t)=  _o_[.sub]d[/](2|t|/_t_[.sub][/])[.sup]p[/]sign(t): t-  time, |t|  _t_[.sub]i[/]/2, _o_(0)- carrier frequency,  _t_[.sub]i[/]- pulse duration, U(t)=  U[.sub]0[/]exp(j_ps_t)- complex envelope with amplitude  U[.sub]0[/] and phase _ps_(t), _o_[.sub]d[/]- frequency  deviation, p- power exponent, sign(t)- sign function. Analytical  expressions are derived for the spectral density S(_o_) and  the  correlation function R(_t_) of such signals. The continuous  phase _ps_(t) in the expression for the spectral density is  approximated is approximated with a piecewise-constant function  coinciding at discrete time intervals _D_t= |g[.sub]i[/]/2N  and the phase difference _ps_(t)- _ps_(t- _t_) in the  expression  for the correlation function is made approximately equal to  _t__o_(t). For a numerical analysis, S(_o_) and R(_t_)  are  normalized to S(0) and R(0) respectively. Calculation for p &lt;  1  and for p &gt;  1 including p= 1 confirm that within the _o_    |g[.sub]d[/] frequency range the signal spectrum is almost  uniform when p= 1 (linear frequency modulation) and nonuniform  when p &lt; 1 or p &gt;  1, with the maximum spectral density S at  frequencies near _o_[.sub]d[/] when p &lt; 1 and near _o_= 0  when p &gt;  1. The farther p is from 1, moreover, the higher and  narrower is the S(_o_)/S(0) peak. Figures 5.</p>

			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: British guns target Germany THE quintessentially British Noel Coward once wrote a celebrated satirical song, Don't Let's Be Beastly to the Germans. Published in the second world war, his sense of humour was, for once, judged a joke too far by the Blitzkrieged British public. In thoroughly different circumstances just two years ago, comments by Mr Nicholas (now Lord) Ridley, a cabinet minister, that Germany was 'already running most of the Community' were deemed too intemperate to allow him to stay in the government. Today, however, beleaguered Britain appears to have lost its inhibitions and declared an open season of vituperation on the awesome might of Teuton power  -mainly on that of the boys from the Bundesbank. Yesterday, Downing street officials refused through clenched teeth to make critical comments on Germany's role in the sterling crisis. The Treasury also followed Frankfurt's lead by insisting that newspaper reports saying Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank president, was again hinting at the need for a further ERM realignment were a misinterpretation. But there is no doubt that several senior British government officials, ministers, and MPs would have little argument with the headline in one mid-market tabloid newspaper yesterday morning: 'Sabotage by the Germans.' The view, as one Tory MP put it, that 'we are paying for East German reconstruction and the industrial expansion of Germany into Eastern Europe' also has widespread resonance nightly in public houses across Britain. In the last three weeks, comments by Bundesbank officials have appeared to have come close to direct political interference in the UK economy. On August 26 Mr Reimut Jochimsen, a member of the Bundesbank's policymaking council, sent tremors through the markets by suggesting that an ERM shake-up could be in the offing. Evidence that his words had niggled came 10 days ago when Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor of the exchequer, seemed almost triumphalist in his summing-up of the Bath EC finance minister's meeting which arm-twisted the Bundesbank into ruling out higher German interest rates. But far from concluding the matter, continuing leaks from Bonn and Frankfurt continued to undermine London's attempts to convey a rosy scenario for interest rates and the pound. Reports citing senior German figures as saying they had offered to cut rates substantially for a general ERM realignment was quoted by the markets as an important influence in the crash in confidence in the pound. Denials by the UK government and the Bundesbank that any such offer had been made were deemed less credible than the original story, a City forex dealer said. Arguably, of course, Britain's dire economic outlook could be blamed, in part, on the traditional enemy - France. If President Mitterrand had not chosen to try to bolster his ailing Socialist party by calling Sunday's plebiscite, it is widely believed, the markets would be in a much more tranquil mood. Yet to many Britons, the current perception is that Germany has laid out a metaphorical beach towel which is engulfing the City of London and Whitehall.</p>

			<p><P> August 9, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SOUTHLAND;  </P> <P> PRO-CHOICE GOP CANDIDATE HOLDS LEAD IN 76TH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT VOTE  </P> <P> The only pro-choice candidate in a field of six Republicans held a 212-vote  lead today with 700 absentee ballots yet to be counted in a special primary  election to fill an Assembly seat in a conservative Southern California  district.  </P> <P> If Tricia Hunter, a registered nurse from Bonita, holds onto her lead after the  absentee ballots are counted, she will face pro-choice Democrat Jeannine  Correia of Poway in an Oct. 3 runoff in the heavily Republican 76th District  that covers arid sections of San Diego and Riverside counties.  </P> <P> The campaign attracted national attention as the first test of strength for  pro-choice and anti-abortion forces since a U.S. Supreme Court ruling July 3  giving state legislatures more power to regulate abortion.  </P></p>

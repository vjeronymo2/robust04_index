			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / French output forecast worsens: Insee statistics institute expects 0.7% decline this year FRANCE'S national output will fall by 0.7 per cent this year and its unemployment rate will rise a further percentage point to hit a level of 12.5 per cent by December, according to a forecast released today by Insee, the official statistics agency. This estimate is gloomier than that of the government, which earlier this month predicted a 0.4 per cent drop in gross domestic product. Insee also forecast that traded goods and services (excluding state-provided services) would contract by 1.2 per cent this year, whereas the government expected only 0.8 per cent. According to Insee, the traded portion of GDP fell by 0.5 per cent in the last three months of 1992, by 0.6 per cent in the first quarter of 1993 and by 0.2 per cent in the second quarter. It predicts a return to stability in the third quarter and growth of 0.2 per cent in the final three months. The sombre prediction about unemployment has been amply borne out this week by announcements of large scale redundancies at state-controlled companies which are trying to cut losses before eventual privatisation. Trade unions at Aerospatiale, the aicraft and defence company, have called a two-hour strike today in protest at a plan to cut up to 1,500 jobs next year following 1,145 redundancies this year. Mr Bernard Attali, president of Air France, said yesterday the airline might have to increase the scope of the 4,500 redundancies it had already planned for 1991-93. Thomson-CSF, the defence electronics group, said it too was looking at various forms of part-time work, paid leave and early retirement schemes in order to avoid redundancies. At the same time, Credit Lyonnais yesterday cast doubt on official estimates of the degree to which the economy will bounce back next year. The bank forecast growth of 1 per cent in 1994, compared to the 1.4-1.5 per cent estimate from the government and the Organisation for Econonmic Co-operation and Development.</p>

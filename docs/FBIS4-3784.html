			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Linxiang (1728 2651 4382) and </F> correspondent Guang Hua (0342 5478) and Zhong He (6988 7729):  "Try by All Possible Means To Promote Economic Development and  Spare No Efforts To Improve People's Living"]    [Excerpts] Under the new situation in which the whole  region is conscientiously implementing the 20-character policy  of the central authorities and the eighth enlarged plenary  session of fifth regional party committee, Wang Qun, secretary  of the regional party committee, travelled a long way to Baotou  city, Bayannur League, and Ih Ju League to conduct investigation  and study and to jointly discuss ways to promote the region's  reform, development, and stability along with the masses of  local cadres at all levels. [passage omitted]    While touching on how to explore ways to promote Inner  Mongolia region's economic development and to resolve financial  difficulties, Comrade Wang Qun pointed out: The broad masses of  cadres have created many good ways and methods in the course of  practice, playing an exemplary role in promoting great  development in all localities across the region. He stressed:  In developing agriculture and animal husbandry, it is necessary  to resolutely manage things in line with the market economic  law, serve the market, readjust the structure in line with local  conditions, and actively develop good quality grain, oil-bearing  crops, sugar, fruits, livestock, poultry, aquatic products, and  other brand-name, special, and quality products. After  analyzing the present situation and potential for developing  Inner Mongolia's agricultural and animal husbandry, Comrade Wang  Qun said: Agriculture and animal husbandry are our region's  basic industries and the best and most important industries  among all. In agriculture and animal husbandry, we should seek  extraordinary development and advance by leaps and bounds. This  conforms to the policy stressed repeatedly by the party Central  Committee on stabilizing and promoting agriculture and is the  fundamental way for making the people rich and the banners and  counties prosperous, as well as the reliable guarantee for  resolving financial difficulties. Our region is rich in land  resources with great potential for development. We still have  30 million mu of cultivated land awaiting development. The  existing cultivated lands and the unreclaimed lands all have  great potentials for increasing production. Our region has 1.35  billion mu of grassland, but each mu of grassland can only  produce one jin of meat, showing that the potential for  development is very great. Our region has a very good  foundation for agricultural and animal husbandry development and  high quality scientific and technical workers and managerial  personnel. With these land and water resources, as well as the  technology and labor forces, it is absolutely possible for us to  realize an extraordinary development in agriculture and animal  husbandry. [passage omitted]    In studying ways to resolve the current financial  difficulties along with grass-roots cadres, Comrade Wang Qun  believed that the financial issue is actually an economic  development issue. It is necessary to resolve it by using the  new ideas of reform and development and by broadening the  sources of income and reducing expenditures. [passage omitted]    On the issue of strengthening tax revenue collection and  management, Comrade Wang Qun stressed: At present, the masses  of cadres at all levels, the party and government organs at all  levels, and the tax departments should strengthen propaganda on  the new tax system, make the broad masses of cadres clearly  understand the new tax system of our country and the relevant  stipulations of the autonomous region, and strengthen the sense  of responsibility and enthusiasm in tax revenue collection and  management. Government leaders at all levels should personally  attend to tax revenue and successfully carry out tax collection  and management. It is necessary to increase the number of  temporary tax collectors in an effort to strengthen the tax  collection force and to guarantee that all sorts of taxes are  collected in full and in a timely manner.    Comrade Wang Qun also put forward specific demands on  maintaining stability, doing a good job in pricing,  nationalities, and religious work, and strengthening party  building and spiritual civilization. He expressed hope that  party committees and governments at all levels and all party  leading cadres at all levels would always keep a sober mind,  carry out these aspects of work in a down-to-earth manner, and  further consolidate and develop a political situation of  stability and unity in Inner Mongolia.</p>

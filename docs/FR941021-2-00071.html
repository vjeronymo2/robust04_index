			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Overall Budget Considerations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It should be noted that limitations on the FY 1995 budget could require across-the-board cost cutting measures. In that case, each RO will determine the amount of budget reduction for its contractors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> IV. FY 1995 National Medicare Contractor Budget: Data, Standards, and Methodology  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Since the submission of the President's FY 1995 Medicare contractor budget request to the Congress in February 1994, we have been developing BPRs to be issued to the contractors. These requirements outline the statement of work and level of effort that fiscal intermediaries and carriers are expected to perform during the upcoming FY in each of the functional areas for which they are responsible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The draft BPRs were released to the ROs in May, and the final BPRs scheduled for release in June 1994. Each fiscal intermediary and carrier will have been given its individual requirements to be used in preparing its FY 1995 budget request in June 1994. The ROs will send any additional information that is pertinent to the fiscal intermediaries and carriers within their region. Fiscal intermediaries and carriers are to submit their budget requests to HCFA no later than 6 weeks after the issuance of the BPRs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After the fiscal intermediaries and carriers review the BPRs, they prepare their budget requests. The central office and RO staff review the fiscal intermediary and carrier budget requests as they are submitted. The RO staff negotiates a final and mutually acceptable budget, within the limits of the funding available to HCFA, with each fiscal intermediary and carrier. The central office prepares a financial operating plan for each RO that provides total regional funding authority for each functional area. The ROs, in turn, prepare a Notice of Budget Approval (NOBA) for each fiscal intermediary and carrier that provides a full year budget plan subject to quarterly cash draw limitations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The basic statement of work, along with new and special activities that fiscal intermediaries and carriers are expected to perform, is described in the BPR package. Fiscal intermediaries and carriers are expected to perform the work as described in the BPR package and in accordance with the standards included in the Contractor Performance Evaluation Program (CPEP) for FY 1995. For consideration in developing their initial budget requests, a copy of the draft CPEP standards will be sent to contractors. Final FY 1995 CPEP standards are published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The following sources of data that contain various workload volumes, functional costs, and manpower information are used in developing the individual fiscal intermediary and carrier budgets for FY 1995:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Forms HCFA&hyph;1523/1524 (a multipurpose form that serves as the Budget Request, Notice of Budget Approval, and Interim Expenditure Report);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Forms HCFA&hyph;1523A/1524A (Schedule of Productivity Investments and Other);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Forms HCFA&hyph;1523B/1524B (Schedule of Credits, EDP, and Overhead);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Forms HCFA&hyph;1523C/1524C (Schedule of Appeals);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Forms HCFA&hyph;1523D/1524D (Schedule of MSP Costs);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Forms HCFA&hyph;1523E/1524E (Schedule of MR Costs);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Forms HCFA&hyph;1523G/1524G (Schedule of Fraud and Abuse);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Form HCFA&hyph;1525A (Contractor Auditing and Settlement Report (CASR));  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Schedules A, B, &amp; C;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Provider Reimbursement Profile;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Schedule of Providers Serviced;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;MSP Savings Report;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Medical Review/Utilization Review Savings Report;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Form HCFA&hyph;2580 (Cost Classification Report);  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

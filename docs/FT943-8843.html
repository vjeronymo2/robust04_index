			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / Companies will live with derivative risk Just over half of finance directors at the UK's top companies regard derivatives as a possible systemic risk to financial systems while 16 per cent see them as a definite risk, according to a survey conducted by Record Treasury Management, the Windsor-based currency hedging specialists. However most believe that derivatives play an important, even essential role in the management of risk, says the survey which drew responses from 81 companies with a total market capitalisation of Pounds 182bn. A vast majority - 93 per cent - expect their use of interest rate derivatives to rise or stay the same and 84 per cent also expect their use of currency derivatives to stay the same or increase. The dominant types of derivative products are swaps and forwards or futures, although 18 per cent of respondents use specially designed derivatives. Almost all respondents believe that disclosure is relevant but only 27 per cent believe that this should be extended to detailed reporting. Two-thirds favour reporting their use of derivatives in strategic terms only. But respondents said derivatives should be used only as a tool to manage a real business risk and never as a means of speculation. They add that while the instruments are not a problem in themselves, they can give rise to problems when they are insufficiently understood or when their associated risks are inadequately communicated. In the view of finance directors, the principal concerns in using derivatives are control of risk and the complexity of many derivative contracts. As a result, 89 per cent of respondents use their own treasury teams to determine the suitability of the products and 45 per cent do their own research. A central bank watchdog is the preferred way to supervise the use of derivatives (55 per cent), followed by self-regulation (34 per cent). But only 6 per cent are in favour of specific legislation.

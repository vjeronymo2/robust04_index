			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / First group of lecturers agrees flexible contracts Further-education employers yesterday agreed with one lecturers' union on the introduction of new employment contracts. They also told other unions in the sector that they would receive no pay rise this year unless they also accepted the contracts. The deal with the Association of Teachers and Lecturers follows last week's intervention in the dispute by Mr Tim Boswell, the further-education minister. He said Pounds 50m would be withheld from colleges' budgets unless more 'flexible' contracts were introduced. But the largest union in the sector, the National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education, refused to sign the deal yesterday. It described the proposals as 'wholly unacceptable', and announced a one-day strike on March 1. The Colleges' Employers' Forum has been in dispute with unions since further-education colleges were taken out of local authority control last April. The new contracts involved halving holiday allowances, adding an hour to the working day, and cutting redundancy notice periods. Mr Gerald Imion, assistant general secretary of the ATL, said the union had felt it was necessary to negotiate unilaterally. He said: 'Our members were telling us they didn't want strike action. They didn't think it was relevant.' The ATL claims about 4,000 members in further-education colleges. They will receive a pay rise of 2.9 per cent, plus a discretionary rise of up to two points in the lecturers' pay-scale (which would allow further increases of Pounds 730 per year for those at the top)and discretionary one-off payments of up to Pounds 500. Mr Roger Ward, chief executive of the forum, described the settlement as 'extraordinarily generous'. He said: 'There can be no prospect of a salary increase for those who do not sign the new contract.' Ms Sue Berryman, Natfhe's negotiating secretary, said that the government and employers had found in the ATL 'a tame union with no base in further education through which to foment division amongst lecturers.'</p>

			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MIXED MEDIA;  </P> <P> ** "EYE OF THE STORM" BILLY JOEL CMV VIDEOCASSETTE ($16.98): ITEMS IN THIS  SURVEY OF POP-RELATED VIDEOS, BOOKS AND LASER DISCS ARE RATED ON A SCALE OF ONE  STAR (POOR) TO FIVE (A CLASSIC).  </P> <P> Joel is at his worst when he's on a social-consciousness kick.  </P> <P> On four of the five videos in this 25-minute collection, including "Leningrad,"  "We Didn't Start the Fire" and two versions of "The Downeaster," he's raising  our consciousness about something or other. Joel comes across as very  in-sincere -- just another millionaire rock star on a crusade. Like these songs  -- from his recent hit album "Storm Front" -- the videos are saturated with  sentimentality and melodramatic excesses. Only the joyous "I Go to Extremes"  isn't tainted by a social message. Joel's music and videos are more likeable  when he's just having fun, crooning about nothing deeper than the trials of  romance and everyday life. DENNIS HUNT  </P></p>

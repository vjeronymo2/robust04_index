			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by V. S. Koltunov, S. M. Baranov, and T. P. </F> Zharova; UDC 545.799.3]    [Abstract] The reactivity of organic hydrazine derivatives  is determined by two factors, viz. the induction effect of the  substituent radical and the basicity of the substituted  hydrazine. The basicity constant of phenylhydrazine is 5.4 X  10[.sup]-6[/], i.e. three orders higher than the basicity  constant for hydrazine. This should lead to an acceleration in  the reduction of Np(VI). Also, the phenyl group has a negative  induction effect and its introduction to the hydrazine molecule  results in a decrease in electron density at the nitrogen atom  and a deceleration in the reduction reaction. In the present  work the rate constant for reduction of Np(VI) with  phenylhydrazine in nitric acid was determined to be 1620  liter[.sup]0.6[/]/mole[.sup]0.6[/]min. Activation energy  and entropy are 31.4 kJ/mole and 83 J/mole, respectively. The  change in reaction rate of Np(VI) reduction when changing from  an alkyl substituted hydrazine derivative to that of  phenylhydrazine may be explained as a confluence of two factors  - the induction effect of the radical-substituent and the  basicity of the substituted hydrazine.

			<p><P> April 21, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BUILDER OF CONTROVERSIAL PROJECT HIRES CITY  PLANNER  </P> <P> Lancaster's planning director has taken a job as a vice president of an  Encino-based development company whose controversial 2,400-home development  proposal in semi-rural western Lancaster was approved by the city last month.  </P> <P> Community Development Director Steve Harding said Friday he will leave his  $72,500 post May 7 for a substantially better-paid post as vice president and  project manager with The Larwin Co., developer of the 885-acre Del Sur Ranch  project that received final council approval March 5.  </P> <P> Harding said the change has nothing to do with the Del Sur project and that his  discussions with Larwin began only after the development was approved.  </P> <P> The switch, which comes 14 months after Harding took the city job, drew  criticism from a leading Lancaster slow-growth activist and prompted one City  Council member to say the council should discuss the move.  </P></p>

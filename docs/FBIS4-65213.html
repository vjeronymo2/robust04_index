			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Massimo D'Alema, deputy secretary of the </F> Democratic Party of the Left, PDS, by Federico Orlando; place  and date not given: "An Alarm Without Precedents" -- first two  paragraphs are LA VOCE introduction]    [Text] "The exchange of letters between [President]  Scalfaro and [Prime Minister-Designate] Berlusconi a few hours  before the presentation of the government to the Quirinale  [office of the president] is without precedent in Italy. The  fact that the head of state has to call upon the prime  minister-designate to abide by the cardinal principles of the  Constitution of the Republic in itself highlights how acute the  issue of democracy is in Italy."    This is how Massimo D'Alema, the conventional "number two"  at  Botteghe Oscure [PDS headquarters], addressed LA VOCE, which  pressed for his judgement as the opposition.    [Orlando] Are you happy with the list of ministers?    [D'Alema] Of course. They are all servants of the old and  new regimes.    [Orlando] And what about the method used to form the new  government?    [D'Alema] This is a complete regression with respect to the  retreat from party politics that began under the Ciampi  government. Here we have replunged into the old private, party,  and prevailing way of thinking. Unfortunately with the addition  of more serious aspects.    [Orlando] Which serious aspects?    [D'Alema] Something that is almost congenial because of its  coarse arrogance; something else that is very serious because of  the deep mystery that surrounds it.    [Orlando] Let us proceed in steps: What is the serious  matter that is almost congenial?    [D'Alema] It is the rise of the audacious arrogance of a new  political class from the hypocrisy of the old DC [Christian  Democratic Party] regime that follows the same itinerary as the  old but with the light-hearted impudence and ferocity of a  neophyte. You can do anything for heaven's sake, but the idea of  nominating your family attorney as justice minister is like  having a monarchy, as royal absolutism was defined before the  constitutional monarchy.    [Orlando] And the other matter, the serious and even  mysterious one?    [D'Alema] I am referring to the appalling lack of openness  during all these negotiations. There were turbid rather than  mysterious elements onn both sides of the clash between  Berlusconi and [Northern League Secretary] Bossi over the  Viminale [Interior Ministry].    [Orlando] Are you alluding to "the reasons that could not be  reported" under which Berlusconi first refused the Viminale to  the League?    [D'Alema] Certainly. Which are the reasons that cannot be  reported and for which a League party member cannot go to the  Viminale? And how is it possible that the League party member  was later considered fit for the Viminale? Do the reasons that  could not be reported no longer exist? Or do they remain and  was it Berlusconi who had to yield after having been given no  option by the League? However, this is not sufficient. What is  just as serious and turbid is the reason the League used to  justify its request to have the Viminale: It said that it  wanted the Interior Ministry to guarantee a democratic  government. In conclusion Bossi says to Berlusconi: "I want  the Viminale because I do not trust your democratic loyalty";  and Berlusconi answers: "I cannot give it to you for reasons  that I cannot even state in public."    [Orlando] And the head of state?    [D'Alema] The head of state is obliged to make continued  calls for obeying rules that should apply to everybody.    [Orlando] In practice he is reminding that he is the one who  nominates the ministers upon the proposal of the prime  minister-designate.    [D'Alema] Yes, but I do not know what kind of equilibrium  can  be formed under these conditions. I only know that there is  reason for concern. Can one imagine a government exposed to  this type of influence at every crossroads? To blackmail? And  how will it behave? Are we moving toward Europe or toward a  world without rules?    [Orlando] Do you think that the lessons of the bribery  scandals were not sufficient to induce all the old and new  parties to respect the rules?    [D'Alema] But the rules are not only those that call for  administrative honesty. Within a month we will be voting in the  European elections, and our prime minister will be presenting  himself as a candidate in all the Italian electoral  constituencies. Can you imagine Major or Kohl presenting  themselves to the British or German people knowing that they  cannot go to Strasbourg? Berlusconi, the prime minister, cannot  be a representative at Strasbourg. Or rather he can, but must  resign as prime minister. Why is he campaigning himself then?  He is misleading the voters, he is making improper use of his  institutional role, he is showing contempt for the European  institutions. He is campaigning for the sole purpose of  channeling votes toward Forza Italia candidates by exploiting  his own person and his own role. All this had never been seen  before in Europe.    [Orlando] Perhaps these are the mistakes of the first steps.    [D'Alema] Let us speak clearly. If the infringements made to  date are taken one by one, none of these are dramatic: neither  the Fininvest-party management at Arcore [Berlusconi's  residence], nor the family attorneys as candidates for the  parliamentary speakerships, or as ministers, nor the exorbitant  financial resources. But all together they can be one dramatic  infringement. Let us take the resources: There is an enormous  disproportion with respect to the other political alignments.  The Center has even been reduced to silence. Forza Italia  instead is everywhere, with posters on city walls and on  Fininvest television stations. If an equal confrontation among  the parties is not reconstructed, democracy will end.    [Orlando] I know that the Center does not have the  resources.  But Center and Left are both sleeping. Is the opposition sure  that it is doing all its duty.    [D'Alema] We have our faults. We have not yet brought to the  attention of the voters what the risks are in a new governing  group that disdains the rules and is full of subversive ends.  There is no doubt that the parliamentary opposition forces must  stay close to the head of state in his role as a guarantor,  otherwise he cannot do this alone.    [Orlando] Is the idea of a common opposition front  reemerging?    [D'Alema] No, also because there are already people who are  making the right moves. I must acknowledge the fact that Pact  for Italy leader Mario Segni rigorously and energetically  presented the problem of incompatibility between the public  function that Berlusconi is getting ready to exercise and his  private interests. But then it is a good thing that Center and  Left are moving independently of each other, also to prevent the  Right from moving into the Center. If the Right moves into the  Center, the risks for democracy increase.    [Orlando] Will we finally have an opposition that is worthy  of the fundamental role that it deserves in democracy?    [D'Alema] There is a fundamental new fact in the Italian  political scene. Not only does the opposition, the great  majority of the opposition, no longer refer to antisystem  models, it is linked, with all its three great components --  Socialist, lay, Catholic -- to the democratic cultures of the  West. We are members of the Socialist International, others of  the Liberals, others of the Christian Democrats. The opposition  parties will not be the ones to make Europe worry about Italy.</p>

			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Franco-German plan to end Bosnia conflict FRANCE and Germany yesterday launched a fresh diplomatic initiative to end the civil war in Bosnia with a plan to lift sanctions gradually against Serbia in return for extra land for Bosnian Moslems. The Franco-German plan marks the first evidence of a shift in European tactics away from total isolation of Serbia and more toward incentives for President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia to end the war. The proposal was given a guarded reception at a meeting of European foreign ministers who remained torn between the need to take action to head off a humanitarian disaster, and the danger of becoming embroiled in the civil war. Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, said it was important to keep as many aid routes open as possible, but 'not by rocketing aid through, and not by using force'. Britain has around 3,000 troops in Bosnia, second in number only to France. Though Mr Hurd predicted that more United Nations forces could be sent in the coming months, Britain would stick to its present contingent, he indicated. At Mr Hurd's suggestion, ministers agreed to consider the plan at a meeting of the Western European Union on November 22 in Luxembourg. British officials said senior military experts would be present. 'We think this is a good context to discuss the real issues and difficulties,' said one. A copy of the Franco-German letter, obtained by Reuters news agency, suggested the creation of UN-protected 'aid corridors' and the reopening of the vital airport of Tuzla to fly in relief this winter. It also proposes that Serbs should cede a further 3 per cent of territory they control in Bosnia, which the Moslems have been claiming and which led to the collapse of the most recent peace plan. In return, the international community should offer Belgrade the promise that UN sanctions would be lifted gradually. Laura Silber in Belgrade adds: Moslem forces yesterday fired two shells on a Croat-held munitions factory in Vitez, central Bosnia, as Croat officials warned the attacks could prompt 'a catastrophe'. In Sarajevo, UN soldiers yesterday escorted the first of 1,500 Serbs, Croats and Moslems to be evacuated from the besieged Bosnian capital as part of an agreement postponed for nearly one year.</p>

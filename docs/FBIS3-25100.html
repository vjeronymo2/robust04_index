			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ya-qub Sibindy, president of the Mozambique </F> Independent Party, Pimo, by Domingos Alberto; place and date not  given]    [Text] [Alberto] The Mozambique Independent Party, Pimo,  was founded on 23 March 1993 and presented itself to the public  in August 1993. Mr. President, in general terms, could you  describe Pimo and what are its political and philosophical  foundations?    [Sibindy] Pimo is an emergent political force based on  democratic principles. It guarantees an ample participation and  its members can freely and critically express their diverse  opinions. It is an independent political party because it does  not accept influence from any other party, the state,  government, any social or professional organization, or any  philosophical association.    Pimo believes that the pursuance of its goals will allow us  to identify the behavior and characteristics of the various  social stratum in our country. To that end, our party has a  research office whose task it is to to carry out studies,  survey, identify problems, carry out inquiries, and listen to  people.    It is on this basis that Pimo believes the fatherland can be  rebuilt from the devastating 16-year war. To that end, our  party relies on three watchwords: peace, moral values, and  progress. Pimo believes that the process of research, as well as  the identification of the behavior and characteristics of each  section of society, must not ignore the aforementioned  watchwords. On the basis of those findings, Pimo wants to  obtain the natural concept of the definition of man, taking into  account the diversity factor.    This is how Pimo believes it can achieve its desired goal of  serving all people. Pimo believes this is the only way to  respond to the concerns and needs of all sections of society, on  the basis of consensus. Pimo also defends the preservation of  the cultural values of the various ethnic and social groups that  make up the Mozambican people. It believes that reconciliation  and harmony are the solutions to political differences. It  seeks general well- being, social justice, and a pluralist  democracy. Pimo believes in a legal state where universal human  rights principles are respected.    [Alberto] It is said that Mozambican citizens of Islamic  origin and "well off" people make up the majority of your  party's mambership. Is that unintended or planned?    [Sibindy] I think it is unintended because, when the party  was formed, it was not our intention to make our politics on the  basis of religion. It is quite possible that there are muslims  or christians within Pimo, but its guidelines include nothing  definite concerning the use of religious "slogans" [preceding  word in English].    [Alberto] One of the great revelations made during your  party's constitutional conference was that you would be a  candidate in the presidential elections, when the first  multiparty elections are held. Do you think you might win?    [Sibindy] I would perhaps like to correct your question  before giving you an answer. When the party held its  constitutional conference, there was no point on our agenda  pertaining to presidential candidacies. We dealt with  everything except what you are saying. To answer your question,  replacing presidential with legislative elections, I must tell  you that Pimo believes it will participate in the legislative  elections and that it will do well.    [Alberto] Seeing that we are discussing this matter, would  you care to advance your predictions concerning the presidential  elections?    [Sibindy] Pimo's answer is the same, concerning the  presidential elections. It is interested in competing in the  presidential elections, but it is up to party structures to  decide who will be candidate.    [Alberto] What is your party doing to achieve that much  desired goal?    [Sibindy] Being a journalist, you will know that Pimo has  not  been much in the press and that we have not talked about our  moves. On the contrary, the first time we appeared in the press  was on MEDIAFAX. Pimo has not wanted to appear in the press for  the simple reason that it believes politics is not made by  constantly doing so but, rather, by working with the grass  roots, directly with the citizens. For instance, Pimo has  branches operating in just about all provinces and districts of  the country and it now wants to expand into the smaller areas.  Pimo prefers to go about its work quietly so it can reap its  fruits -- that it, to increase its membership. To give you an  example, we work quietly and then we make a public announcement  when we feel we have attained the goals we had sought. Our  party's constitutional conference was proof of that. I toured  northern Mozambique to do work with the grass roots and I found  that the Mozambique Liberation Front [Frelimo] and the  Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] are dominant. However,  when an unarmed opposition party comes along to do political  work with the people, it is prevented by Renamo militants in  government-administered areas. Just to give you an example, we  were surprised when we were stoned by Renamo supporters or  sympathizers. How can people say they have fought for democracy  when they break democratic norms just as the results of their  struggle begin to emerge? Difficulties in gaining access to  Renamo or government-controlled areas in Angoche and Nacala  confirm that Renamo is hostile. I can even add that we would  have been shot at, had we insisted on forcibly entering those  areas....    [Alberto] Given the situation the country is in, what would  you do were you to win the country's first free and democratic  elections?    [Sibindy] Pimo believes that it should strengthen the  country's pacification process. The government should not be  made up of Pimo members alone, just because Pimo won the  elections. There is the need to pacify all political forces in  this country so that both those who have weapons and those who  do not have them feel responsibile for being part of the new  government. Pimo has a research office that talks to workers,  Mozambican businessmen, religious figures, traditional chiefs,  other traditional figures, people of other perceptions, and  civilian society at large to obtain their opinions regarding  what they would like to see in certain areas. Pimo would like  to institute a unitary state where there is decentralization and  a separation of powers. Governors and administrators must be  appointed locally. Resources must be used, taking into account  the development of each area, after consulting with the people.    To Pimo, moral values are one of the most important of its  watchwords. It is a priority that people recover their moral  values. The individual's participation in society has to do  with that individual's moral values. That is an indispensable  element to add to the qualities a human being should possess.  The regime instituted by the ruling party has been the catalyst  of the destruction of Mozambican society's moral values, thereby  disrupting the social fabric. Many of the irregularities  reported today arise from a lack of moral values in all areas.    With regard to progress, Pimo believes that the Mozambican  man is central to this country's development. Within this  framework, Pimo also intends to implement plans concerning work  to integrate citizens through the relevant religious and other  civilian institutions. So, Pimo's links with religion aim at an  effective implementation of its programs. Within an economic  context, Pimo intends to open the necessary space for  competition to occur, thereby stimulating development. Pimo  supports privatization, the creation of joint enterprises, and a  fiscal policy that will serve the interests of national  businessmen.    [Alberto] In addition to what you have just said, does Pimo  have other projects and, if so, in what areas?    [Sibindy] The Pimo leadership has devised and drawn up many  plans. In the area of construction, Pimo plans to erect a  10-story building where its premises are at this stage. That is  to store all the party's bureaucratic machinery at the national  level. Some of the flats will be used to provide accommodation  for members coming from the provinces. In the transportation  sector, Pimo defends the creation of collective transportation  companies to minimize the shortages we see today....    [Alberto] For instance, do you not have plans for the  agricultural sector? After all, the 16-year war did much to  devastate that sector and needs urgent rehabilitation because  agriculture is the basis for development in a country such as  ours, which is not producing enough at this point.    [Sibindy] Pimo has a program for the agricultural sector  but,  as I have said, I do not think it is opportune to talk about  that because work is under way to consult with various sections  of civilian society so we get an idea about what they would like  our agricultural policy to be.    [Alberto] What backing does Pimo have to implement those  plans?    [Sibindy] In addition to contributions by its members and  the  funds made available to the political parties by the government,  Pimo enjoys the support of the Mozambican and international  communities to implement those plans.    [Alberto] What social and economic system would Pimo  envisage  for this country?    [Sibindy] Pimo defends a free market economy where the state  only has the role of controller. The state's intervention must  not be negative. It must let people work as they please, on the  basis of mutual trust, because for a person to become a  businessman he must be worthy of some trust. There must also be  a clear fiscal policy that will not contravene existing norms.    [Alberto] What is Pimo's ideological line and what type of  state does it stand for?    [Sibindy] Ideologically, Pimo pursues a social democratic  line. It supports a unitary state with decentralized and  separate powers. It is important to note here that provinces and  districts must be given the right to decide on certain local  matters. For instance, if a district has the means to build a  health post, it should do so without having to wait for the red  tape of provincial or national structures.    [Alberto] When you talk about decentralization, are you  thinking about possible federalism?    [Sibindy] Well, I am not talking about federalism. As I have  pointed out earlier, I am talking about a unitary state. I am  talking about decentralizing powers. Autonomy is not in  territorial terms in previously established areas. In doing so,  Pimo wants to avoid bureaucracy and give responsibilities to the  people of each given area. They must take the initiative into  their own hands, instead of waiting for decisions to be made for  them by the central authorities.    [Alberto] Is it in Pimo's plans to accept coalition with  other political parties?    [Sibindy] Pimo will agree to coalition with other parties to  safeguard peace and to strengthen reconciliation. Pimo can form  a coalition on the basis of equal treatment and will open the  possibility of debate to see to what extent the idea can be  implemented.    [Alberto] What do you think about the process of confining  soldiers that began recently?    [Sibindy] Pimo believes the people who are being confined  are  human beings, so the United Nations must do its best to provide  them reasonable logistical cond?tions.    [Alberto] What do you think about this process. at least up  to this stage?    [Sibindy] I believe the process is running smoothly. The  steps being taken are encouraging, and with some arrangements  the expected results could be achieved.    [Alberto] What system among parliamentary,  semipresidentialist, and presidentialist democracies would you  like to see implemented after the elections?    [Sibindy] Pimo would prefer a parliamentary democracy.    [Alberto] Why?    [Sibindy] Because that system confers strong powers on  parliament. In that system the government is appointed by  parliament, and it is answerable to parliament. There are  constitutional and administrative courts, which are independent  organs that intervene on any problem that may emerge.    [Alberto] What do you think about reports that the Malawian  "Young Pioneers" entered Mozambican territory, and what  implications may that have for our country?    [Sibindy] If it is true that the Malawi youths are among us,  it is an issue that the government has undertaken to solve in  good faith, and I must say that I encourage the government to  continue working on it using all diplomatic and peaceful means  until the problem is solved. This problem threatens peace at a  time when we are doing away with the war machine. No one wants  a foreign armed force violating our border. Pimo believes the  government is in a transitional stage and no one is interested  in conflicts. It appeals to the Malawian Government to be  understanding and to cooperate with the Mozambican Government.    [Alberto] What is your comment on the controversy that  emerged in the election of the three members who will represent  the unarmed opposition in the National Elections Commission?    [Sibindy] I believe Dr. Jose Mayopue's case is unique. I  should simply congratulate the unarmed opposition for the  position it took. If he feels he is still obligated to the  Frelimo and wants to serve it, he cannot possibly render  services to other parties. If he left Frelimo, then his case may  be an exception. In this case he is the one to choose. We of  the opposition should ask Dr. Jose Mayopue what he prefers.    [Alberto] Imagine that your party wins elections: Do you  already have plans for a foreign policy?    [Sibindy] Pimo intends to maintain good diplomatic relations  with all countries of the world, giving priority to the  development of cooperation among peoples, promotion of the  defense and territorial integrity of the country, and peaceful  coexistence without interference in domestic affairs of other  countries, with reciprocal benefits, equality, friendship,  solidarity, and cooperation among peoples.    Pimo also intends to have foreign relations that result in  mutual benefits. Pimo does not agree with relations based on  "priorities." In 1977 Frelimo diverted from its aims, surprising  its militants with the announcement that it was a  Marxist-Leninist oriented party. I believe this decision was  made due to reasons of military cooperation, the supply of  weapons, and as a reward for favors. Obviously, the model had to  be imposed. Pimo hopes that what happened with Frelimo will not  happen with the Renamo; otherwise, we shall have to pay in kind  in the years to come for the military undertakings.    Pimo is independent because it has not made this kind of  undertaking, and when it approaches the international community  in line with its foreign policy, it will do so freely without  influences such as I have just mentioned. That is why Pimo  fears for the victory of one the former warring factions and  appeals to the opposition to unite as an independent party.    [Alberto] You have previously stated that you had served  another party. I would like to know what you think about being  a politician.    [Sibindy] It is difficult to be a politician, if one's  movement is formed under pressure or guided by foreign interests  or influences. That is difficult. Pimo favors the formation of  a force or political movement that does not depend on external  political influence. Even if it is an armed movement, the  criteria has to be the same. We should not satisfy the  interests of outside blocs in the name of national interests.  We believe that a nationalist is the one who, of his free will,  strives to serve the nation. Politics is easy if one follows  that pattern. It is more difficult to be a politician when  there is a tendency to serve foreign interests.    [Alberto] Is this why you left the party you belonged to  join  the one that emerged recently?    [Sibindy] Yes, that is the reason. Otherwise I would still  belong to Frelimo. As soon as I realized that Frelimo was  identifying with interests that did not correspond to  Mozambique's, I realized that it was no longer a party whose aim  was to serve the people. It was then that I began thinking of  leaving it.</p>

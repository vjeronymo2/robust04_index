			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / Leading Article: Competitiveness Much as the US and Europe worry about their ability to compete, they lead the world in the business of studying competitiveness. Indeed, the issue has been so extensively analysed recently that there might seem little left to say. To its credit, yesterday's report on the subject by Unice, the European employers' federation, manages usefully to advance the frontiers of the debate. As well as making predictable calls for more flexible labour markets, lower social costs and action to help small business, Unice embraces a more radical idea. It is that the governments to which the report is addressed are mainly responsible for the problems they are being called on to solve. The only way out, it suggests, is to reduce permanently their traditional roles, particularly in respect of public expenditure. Unice's argument is not just that public spending is becoming increasingly difficult to finance, but that much of it retards, rather than enhances, productive economic enterprise. It urges more ambitious privatisation and rigorous appraisal of future government investment, to ensure that it contributes to economic welfare and does not squander resources on activities which could be performed more efficiently by a competitive private sector. Such notions, though dear to British ministers, are far less widely shared elsewhere in Europe. Among many continental governments, EU policymakers and left-of-centre politicians generally, there remains a strong conviction that increases in public expenditure are self-evidently a good thing, while cuts are almost always economically and socially regressive. They would do well to read the World Bank's latest World Development Report, published this week. It mounts a devastating case against governments' record as investors, citing widespread evidence of waste and economic distortion, particularly in infrastructure projects. True, Europe's performance has been superior to that of most developing countries. However, that makes no less valid the Bank's central argument that public investment focuses too much on increasing the stock of infrastructure for its own sake, and far too little on the quality of services delivered. The unambiguous message is that if the investment is to serve productive ends, the state must make way for market forces. That conclusion will not be easy to sell politically in Europe, nor to implement. Unice's report, at least, offers a starting point. It also provides timely support to Mr Gunter Rexrodt, Germany's economics minister, who says he wants to use his government's EU presidency in the second half of this year to lead a crusade in favour of deregulation.</p>

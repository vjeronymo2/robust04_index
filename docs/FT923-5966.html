			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / Advance of 26% to Pounds 113m at WH Smith: Chairman attributes result to wide diversity of group's activities WH SMITH Group, the retailer and distributor which grew from a newsagent's shop opened 200 years ago this year, was glad of its wide range of activities in its latest financial year. Sir Simon Hornby, chairman, said that the breadth gave strength which helped the group increase pre-tax profits by 26.6 per cent to Pounds 112.7m in the year to end May. Smith's A shares rose 15p to 376p yesterday as the profit rise exceeded expectations. The rise was on sales of Pounds 2.13bn, up 8 per cent. Trading profits rose 7.8 per cent to Pounds 120.9m, and interest charges fell from Pounds 28.2m to Pounds 3.4m, partly because of the Pounds 148m rights issue at the end of the previous financial year. Sir Simon said that gross margins had been maintained in spite of competitive pressures. Productivity had increased. Profits benefited from the closure last year of its travel business and the sale of television interests for Pounds 45m. Both operations had been loss-making. However, Smith's joint venture in do-it-yourself retailing lost the group Pounds 2.7m, compared with a profit of Pounds 10.4m. Sir Malcolm Field, group managing director, said that progress had been made in developing a new format for the stores. Smith had been forced to join the 'insane' price cutting in the sector to protect market share, he said. Aside from DIY, Smith's retailing activities, which include the WH Smith chain, Our Price music and video shops, Waterstones book shops, and a 50 per cent stake in Virgin Retail, increased trading profits from Pounds 87.8m to Pounds 89.8m. Sir Simon said the market for recorded music fell 5 per cent, but Smith had held its market share. He was sure the market would recover. The group's US retailing activities were 'beginning to go forward very well', Sir Simon said. Trading profits from the US were Pounds 6.5m, up from Pounds 4m. The distribution activities, including newspaper and book wholesaling and office supplies, lifted trading profits from Pounds 24.3m to Pounds 29m. A sharp fall in the rate of tax offset the increase in shares in issue to push earnings per share up 11.7 per cent to 31.5p. A proposed final dividend of 9.1p (up from 8.5p) will give a total of 13.4p (against 12.5p last time) up 7.2 per cent. Lex, Page 16; Details, Page 18</p>

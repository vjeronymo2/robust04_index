			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / Bowater expects further recovery: Raw material price rises passed on to customers Bowater, the packaging and printing group, yesterday reported a recovery in important markets and said higher raw materials prices were largely being passed on to customers. Pre-tax profits for the six months to June 30 rose 2 per cent from Pounds 103m to Pounds 105m - at the top end of expectations. Excluding exceptional gains of Pounds 8m last year, and a loss on disposals of Pounds 4m this year, the underlying increase was from Pounds 95m to Pounds 109m, a rise of 15 per cent. Mr David Lyon, chief executive, said an upturn in demand in the US, UK and some continental European markets had led to price rises for Bowater's main raw materials - paper, and resin for plastics - of about 20 per cent between April and June. 'We have generally been able to pass these increases on to customers, although there are some timing delays,' Mr Lyon said. He said raw materials prices were expected to increase by up to another 10 per cent by December, with shortages of some commodities forecast, although prices remained about 25 per cent below their peak in the late 1980s. This was likely to lead to a further year-on-year improvement in the second half. The positive outlook - which contrasted strongly with Bowater's downbeat assessment of future trends after last year's strong results - lifted Bowater's shares 19p to 492p. Mr Lyon said Bowater's acquisition of healthcare packaging manufacturers DRG and Cope Allman in 1992, and of Specialty Coatings International last year, had given it critical mass in several target markets with strong growth opportunities. Group turnover rose 14 per cent from Pounds 1.02bn to Pounds 1.16bn, with the group operating margin up from 8.8 per cent to a record 9.2 per cent. After a difficult second half last year, the packaging and print businesses staged a recovery with sales up 3 per cent to Pounds 580.7m, and operating profits of Pounds 49.8m against last year's Pounds 50.9m. Cosmetic packaging performed well in the UK and continental Europe, but food packaging prices remained under pressure from price competition among food retailers. Healthcare packaging enjoyed 'buoyant' demand. The acquisition of SCI greatly increased the contribution from Bowater's coated products division, with sales up from Pounds 194.2m to Pounds 280.3m, and operating profits from Pounds 22.5m to Pounds 32.7m. Both sales and profits also increased in Bowater's building and engineering businesses, and its tissue business in Australia. Earnings per share, including exceptional items, increased from 12.3p to 14.2p, and the interim dividend is raised by 9 per cent from 5.3p to 5.8p. Lex, Page 22</p>

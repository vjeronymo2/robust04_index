			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Punt returns to ERM bands THE DOLLAR was more than a pfennig weaker against the D-Mark at one stage in European trading yesterday as currency dealers continued to respond to last Friday's disappointing employment report in the US, writes James Blitz. The US currency's weakness yesterday was not the product of D-Mark strength. The German currency was virtually unmoved against the French franc in quiet markets. Indeed, the Irish punt, which is still seen by some dealers as a devaluation candidate, enjoyed some firmness in Europe's exchange rate mechanism against the D-Mark bloc of currencies. Instead, last Friday's US non-farm payroll report, which rose by 64,000 in December when the market had been expecting a 100,000 increase, continued to cast a shadow over the dollar. The market is more confident about the prospects for US economic recovery. But the dollar has risen by around 10 pfennigs since December 18, when it was around DM1.55, and such a rise needs to be accompanied by very strong data if it is to be sustained. 'A period of profit-taking after such a rise was inevitable,' said Mr Steve Hannah, head of research at IBJ International in London. The dollar ended in London at DM1.6305, down from a previous close of DM1.6375. But in New York it later improved to finish at DM1.6340. In Europe, the main focus continued to be on the Irish punt, which traded below its ERM floors against two currencies last week. For most of yesterday, the Irish currency was back inside its ERM bands against the Belgian franc and Dutch guilder. Having avoided a devaluation at the weekend, as many had feared, the currency enjoyed some renewed confidence. Any speculator borrowing punts overnight at the current rate of 100 per cent must hope for an imminent devaluation if a profit is to be made. The punt appreciated to about BFr54.30 to the Belgian franc and NFl 2.9595 to the Dutch guilder towards the end of European trading. Rates for lending overnight money softened a little from the heights of 100 per cent seen last Friday. Attention was also focused on the Italian lira, which continued to appreciate strongly against most other currencies. At one point yesterday it was trading at L907 to the D-Mark, some 4.8 per cent higher than its level of L950 last Tuesday. The Italian government's DM4bn bond issue had a good response, as did statements that the lira could re-enter the ERM this year. Mr Avinash Persaud, a currency economist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, pointed out that the net yield on Italian bonds is currently running at 13 1/2 per cent. 'The high yields on Italian paper go some way to explaining this recent appreciation in the currency,' he said. The French franc enjoyed another quiet day against the D-Mark, ending at FFr3.400 to the German unit after a previous close of FFr3.402.</p>

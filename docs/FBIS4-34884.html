			<p>BFN     [Text] Tegucigalpa, 26 Jun (ACAN-EFE) -- The Honduran  Government is prepared to send military forces to maintain peace  in Haiti, Foreign Minister Ernesto Paz Aguilar said today,  although he does not agree with a military invasion of that  Caribbean nation.    The diplomat said his country is prepared to join a  multinational peacekeeping force in Haiti, as it does in Western  Sahara, where it has a small military contingent.    The situation in Haiti was one of the topics the foreign  minister discussed on 25 June with U.S. Secretary of Defense  William Perry, who is wrapping up in Puerto Rico today a visit  that included Panama and Honduras.    Paz Aguilar reiterated Honduras will not accept a massive  inflow of Haitian refugees, because it did that two years ago  with 250 Haitians who were taken to the Bonito Oriental sector  in the Caribbean region of this country. There are still  approximately 26 Haitians in that area who would like to go to  the United States or Canada. The refugees sparked certain  disturbances in the Bonito Oriental sector. Honduras would like  the situation to return to normal in Haiti, where the military  toppled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide two years ago, the  foreign minister said.</p>

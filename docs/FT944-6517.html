			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Kalamazoo rises 19% to Pounds 3m Kalamazoo, the computer services and printed systems group, continued its profits growth with a 19 per cent rise in pre-tax figures in the six months to September 30. Pre-tax profits were Pounds 3m, against Pounds 2.53m in the same period last year. This turned into earnings per share of 4.98p (4.2p), and prompted an interim dividend increase from 0.85p to 1p. Group turnover, however, was slightly lower at Pounds 28.26m (Pounds 29.56m). However, Mr Mike Langmore, chief executive, explained that in the computer services division, new products had been introduced which had led to Pounds 3m of firm orders with a further Pounds 3m under negotiation. The results would come through in the second half. In the printed systems division - lossmaking in 1992-93 but profitable after restructuring - Kalamazoo has been cutting back the range of products and moving into higher value new lines like security printing. During the second half, Kalamazoo expects a contribution from its newly acquired ET Hi-Tec and WIS Computer Systems, both bought to expand the computer services division. During the first half, new acquisitions accounted for Pounds 13,000 of operating profit of Pounds 2.77m (Pounds 2.52m). The group holds net cash of Pounds 7.4m. 'We can do small acquisitions without going to the market for cash,' said Mr Langmore.</p>

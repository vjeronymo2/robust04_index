			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Managua BARRICADA in Spanish published a  report on 17 May 94 pp 1, 7 that says the economic cabinet on 16  May formally asked the diplomatic representatives of donor  countries for $180 million in additional aid for the next three  years. Presidency Minister Antonio Lacayo said the additional  funds would result in higher economic growth rates. In the  meeting, the government presented to the community of donors a  report on progress made toward the democratization and  macroeconomic stabilization process. It highlighted the  demobilization of the 3-80 Northern Front, the constitutional  reform process, and the conclusion of the Enhanced Structural  Adjustment Facility, ESAF, negotiations. Lacayo said Nicaragua  is requesting additional resources, not in donations but in  credit lines in the medium and long term to help the country's  financial system.</p>

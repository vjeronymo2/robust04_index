			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Group Dev plans wind down Group Development Capital Trust yesterday announced net asset value per share of 55.3p at the end of the half-year to March 31, against 54.3p in the previous first half. Directors also recommended a scheme intended to wind down the company within two years. The intention is to enable investors to 'realise their investment for a sum approximating to asset value'. As investments have reached maturity in recent months the board has realised them and proceeds have been reinvested in gilt-edged securities. Directors aim to make a progressive return of capital to shareholders. Approval for the plan will be sought at an extraordinary meeting. The company hopes to return about 25p per share to investors by September 30, with one or more further payments to come. The board would, however, still consider any other proposals it received. Gross revenue in the half-year increased to Pounds 266,200 (Pounds 137,800) and a pre-tax profit of Pounds 115,200 compared with a Pounds 4,100 deficit previously. Earnings per share amounted to 0.41p against losses of 0.05p. There is no interim dividend, but the company hopes to make a substantial increase in the dividend for the year.</p>

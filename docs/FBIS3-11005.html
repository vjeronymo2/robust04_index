			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] At a strictly confidential academic conference  yesterday, high-ranking officials of the Prosecutor General's  Office and representatives of the Criminal Bar Association  discussed the problems that plague the Prosecutor General's  Office.    With regard to operations and administration, the analysis  was conclusive: Proceedings for taking witness testimony are  handled inadequately, there is no proper training in questioning  techniques, there are not enough investigators to back up  prosecuting attorneys, there is a lack of timely information on  prosecutions, and serious deficiencies in the preliminary  investigation units mean that cases may remain in the initial  inquiry stage for months.    In a conciliatory tone, Deputy Prosecutor General Francisco  Sintura, Bogota Regional Prosecutor's Office Director Jorge  Enrique Bautista, Bogota Sectional Prosecutor's Office Director  Jose Haxel de la Pava, Bogota Technical Corps Director Luis  Fernando Velez, and trial attorneys studied the problems and  pledged to seek solutions.    First, the prosecution officials gathered at the Educational  Extension Center of Colombia heard complaints aired by the  attorneys, led by criminal law specialist Antonio Cancino. They  acknowledged that the problems stem from the lack of trained  personnel and the failure to realize that there is a new  accusatory system in place in Colombia.    These were the main topics of discussion yesterday.  <H5>  Questioning Witnesses </H5>   The trial attorneys claimed that the proceedings for taking  witness testimony are almost never conducted by a prosecuting  attorney, and they complained that even though the proceedings  should be regarded as a single process, each session is  conducted by a different clerk.    Thus, if five witnesses are to testify in a case, each one  is  heard by a different official, and often that official does not  know the background of the case. As a result, according to the  trial attorneys, some incongruous decisions can be made.    In some cases, the attorneys alleged, the person who is  supposed to do the questioning ends up asking the witness to  give a narrative of the case. "Many officials say to the  witness, `Tell me something about the case so I can ask you  questions,' and consequently, when the prosecuting attorney  reads the transcript, he finds holes and anomalies that he must  clear up by calling in the witness again and taking his  testimony personally."  <H5>  Preliminary Proceedings </H5>   "With the advent of the Prosecutor General's Office,  everything became a preliminary proceeding. Now, even when there  is a known suspect, the prosecutors begin the process as if they  were still in the inquiry stage, with no suspects. They take up  to six months to go through preliminary proceedings before they  finally decide that there is enough evidence to file charges  against the suspect."    This assertion by a criminal attorney reveals that there is  a  crisis in the operation of the Preliminary and Permanent  Investigation Units. According to the attorneys, many  investigations are carried out almost entirely in these units,  and then by the time charges are filed and an attempt is made to  find the suspect, he has already fled.    A prosecutor in the Bogota special unit acknowledged that he  has discovered a very common error in this preliminary  investigation unit, and that is the opening of an investigation  without sufficient evidence against the accused.    "In this case, the opposite of what the attorneys are  complaining about occurs," he said. "Sometimes the prosecuting  attorneys in the preliminary investigation unit decide that  because the victim was able to name the suspect, he has to be  called in for questioning, and of course formal charges have to  be filed, when in fact they have not checked to see if this is  an unfounded accusation."  <H5>  Clerks </H5>   The trial attorneys revealed that a high percentage of the  1,030 attorneys surveyed by the Bar Association believe that the  new Common Clerk's Office is a failure.    These clerk's offices, which are part of the new structure  of  the Prosecutor General's Office, consist of an executive clerk  and several deputy clerks whose job is to handle the  administration of case files: filings, notices, etc.    These offices, complain the attorneys, have turned the  prosecuting attorneys into "faceless bureaucrats," because  everything related to a prosecution is discussed with the  clerks, who are generally not familiar with the facts of the  case.    The attorneys also complained about problems created by the  inadequate organization of cases. Thus, they explained, to find  a case file at a Common Clerk's Office, it is necessary to have  three numbers: the internal reference number, the unit case  number, and the assignment office intake number.    In addition, the attorneys say, some employees at the  clerk's  office are very rude at times. "The issue of the clerk's  offices," said spokesmen for the trial attorneys, "is the  sticking point in the Prosecutor General's Office. And we are  the only ones who are aware of that, since we are on the other  side of the railing."    As for the Regional Prosecutor's Offices, which are  responsible for drug trafficking and terrorism cases, the  criticism focused on poor initial processing of cases. According  to the attorneys--and this was acknowledged by the Prosecutor  General's Office--many cases are poorly identified in the  system. Sometimes, only the first defendant's name appears, and  codefendants are listed as "others" in the files. As a result,  trying to find the case file for one of those "others" can be a  Herculean task.  <H5>  The Technical Investigation Corps </H5>   With regard to the Technical Investigation Corps (CTI), the  attorneys noted that it is a subdivision of the Prosecutor  General's Office that has very limited technical, human, and  financial resources to meet the needs of the prosecutors and of  the investigations that are carried out all over the country.    The trial attorneys complained that the Prosecutor General's  Office has issued a directive instructing prosecutors to use  only the services of CTI agents whenever possible.    Nevertheless, the shortage of personnel makes this almost  impossible. In Bogota, for example, there are 59 investigators  working on all the prosecution cases under way in the 317  Departmental Prosecutor's Offices.  <H5>  [Box, p 11A] </H5> <H5>  Prosecutor General's Office Responds </H5>   The representatives of the Prosecutor General's Office who  participated in the debate welcomed the criminal attorneys'  proposals and admitted that there are errors that must be  corrected immediately.    Deputy Prosecutor General Francisco Jose Sintura stated that  there is a great shortage of Judicial Police investigators, not  only in the CTI, but also in the National Police and the  Administrative Department of Security (DAS). For now, however,  the government has said that no new positions can be created  until 1995.    The official admitted that there are very few employees  trained in the techniques of questioning witnesses. "Sometimes,"  he said, "the questioner asks the witness two or three very  simple questions and then asks him if he has anything more to  add, just because he has to close the proceeding."    He went on to say that total quality courses have already  been implemented so that employees of the Prosecutor General's  Office can begin training.    As for the problems in the Common Clerk's Offices, the  deputy  prosecutor general stated that in the next few days, a pilot  program will begin in the clerk's offices. This program, called  Plan Chrysalis, includes the completion of a data processing  system, as the current system is inadequate.    In this regard, the director of the Regional Prosecutor's  Office of Bogota, Jorge Enrique Bautista, said that there have  been data processing problems in the regional prosecutor's  offices since the beginning, and as a result, it is often  difficult to find case files or to determine the status of a  case. He noted, however, that a new system is being devised  under the auspices of the Social Studies Front (FES).    Referring to the problems of incompetence or irregularities  committed by employees, Sintura urged the trial attorneys to  file complaints with the Treasury Inspector's Office so that  those responsible can be identified and punished.</p>

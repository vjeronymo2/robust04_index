			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / International Company News: Black &amp; Decker shows big gain in final quarter BLACK &amp; Decker, the US household equipment-maker and information services provider, yesterday unveiled a fourth-quarter profit of Dollars 31.9m, thanks primarily to lower interest expenses and a turnround in earnings from its Brazilian operations. In the same quarter of 1990, the company earned just Dollars 6.8m. For the full-year, Black &amp; Decker made a net profit of Dollars 53m, a modest improvement on the Dollars 51.1m earned a year earlier. Revenues for the year fell slightly to Dollars 4.6bn, due mostly to recessions in three big markets - the US, the UK and Australia. The company was encouraged by stronger-than-expected domestic fourth-quarter sales, particularly of its power tools, household products and Kwikset locks, and by its low inventories. Black &amp; Decker's figures were well received on Wall Street, and the shares rose Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 24 5/8 on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>

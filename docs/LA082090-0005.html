			<p><P> August 20, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. POLICY ON TEXTILES  </P> <P> In response to "U.S. Textile Policy Is No Bargain," editorial, Aug. 6:  </P> <P> As a domestic manufacturer of women's dresses and sleep wear, we have no  problem competing in the world marketplace so long as we are faced "with a fair  competitive environment." We employ over a hundred sewing machine operators,  cutters and other related textile professionals in our plants in Southern  California.  </P> <P> The problem is that we along with hundreds of other manufacturers who strive to  make high-quality products which offer value to the consumer are facing an  unfair competitive environment. Why? Because California just increased the  minimum wage to $4.25 and because of other benefits which we must provide for  employees such as Social Security and disability along with a myriad of other  regulations which we must follow in addition to the non-regulatory but humane  benefits such as vacation and health care.  </P> <P> This is why we support the textile bill which is currently before the House  which would restrict imports of textiles, apparel and footwear. The bill serves  simply to make the competitive environment fair and equal because by limiting  imports, it will help domestic manufacturers to pay for the regulatory burden  which our overseas counterparts do not face. Overseas factories in Hong Kong,  Singapore, India and other Third World countries do not have to provide the  same wages, benefits nor comply with the myriad of labor, health and  environmental regulations which California manufacturers are faced with.  </P> <P> We pride ourselves on the "Made in the U.S.A. with love" label which is in all  garments which we manufacture, and the fact that we recycle most material waste  in order to be "environmentally responsible."  </P> <P> However, in today's current California regulatory environment if the bill  before the House on restricting imports is not passed, then the incentive will  be for manufacturers like ourselves to shut down our domestic factories, lay  off hundreds of workers and begin manufacturing overseas where we can employ  "cheap foreign fingers."  </P> <P> The textile bill plainly provides incentive for manufacturing jobs to stay  within the United States and provides workers with a job and their dignity.  Failure to pass the textile bill will continue the long-term incentive for  apparel manufacturers to lay off their workers and shift apparel production  overseas. The result will be placing of thousands of people on welfare.  </P> <P> The editorial characterizes U.S. textile apparel makers as "fat, happy and  complacent." We are "lean, mean and socially and environmentally responsible"  and fighting for survival in a very competitive and tough economic environment.  </P> <P> PETER SCHARFF  </P> <P> President  </P> <P> Blue Bay Inc.  </P> <P> Culver City  </P></p>

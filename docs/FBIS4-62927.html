Heard: on the results of the secret ballot for the election  of the chairman of the Supreme Council of Ukraine.    People's deputies of Ukraine Vasyl Vasylyovych Durdynets,  Oleksandr Mykolayovych Karpov, Oleksandr Oleksandrovych Moroz,  and Yuriy Kazymyrovych Tyma were entered in the secret ballot  paper for the election of the chairman of the Supreme Council of  Ukraine.    Proceeding from the results of the secret ballot the  Counting  Commission has determined the following: the overall number of  people's deputies of Ukraine elected by the time of holding the  session is 338. The number of people's deputies of Ukraine  whose plenary powers have been recognized by the Supreme Council  of Ukraine is 336. The number of the people's deputies of  Ukraine who received the secret ballot papers is 326. The  number of the people's deputies of Ukraine who took part in the  ballot is 322.    The results of the ballot are as follows:    Vasyl Vasyloyvych Durdynets: 103 votes in favor of the  candidate and 219 votes against.    Oleksandr Mykolayovych Karpov: 14 votes in favor of the  candidate and 308 votes against.    Oleksandr Oleksandrovych Moroz: 171 votes in favor of the  candidate and 151 votes against.    Yuriy Kazymyrovych Tyma: nine votes in favor of the  candidate  and 313 votes against.    The number of ballot papers recognized as invalid: none.    In compliance with Article 97 of the Constitution of  Ukraine,  [word indistinct] 22/6 of the temporary time-table of the  sittings of the Supreme Council of Ukraine, the Counting  Commission has decided to consider Oleksandr Oleksandrovych  Moroz elected chairman of the Supreme Council of Ukraine.    Chairman of the counting commission: Syrota.    Deputy chairman of the counting commission: Pavlovskyy.    Secretary of the counting commission: Stretovych.    The protocol was not signed by one member of the Counting  Commission, Ratushnyy -- I do not remember his initials. He  expressed his personal opinion which I will read out, if you do  not mind. This is the personal opinion of member of the Counting  Commission, deputy Mykhaylo Ratushnyy. Due to the fact that I  was forwarding a proposal that the chairman of the Supreme  Council of Ukraine should be elected by two thirds of votes and  this proposal was turned down, I refuse to sign the protocol.  This does not mean that I consider that the Counting Commission  made any violations during the counting of votes.    Such is the protocol.    [Symoneko] Esteemed people's deputies. We must approve the  protocol of the counting commission for the election of the  Supreme Council chairman. I am putting it to the vote: Those  who are in favor of approving the protocol of the counting  commission for the election of the Supreme Council chairman,  please vote.    The decision is made.    Esteemed people's deputies. We must pass a resolution on the  election of the Supreme Council chairman. If you let me, I will  offer it to you. Any objections?    Resolution by the Supreme Council of Ukraine on the chairman  of the Supreme Council of Ukraine -- the Supreme Council of  Ukraine resolves to elect people's deputy of Ukraine Oleksandr  Oleksandrovych Moroz chairman of the Supreme Council of Ukraine.    I am putting this to the vote. Who is in favor of adopting  this resolution?    The decision is made.</p>

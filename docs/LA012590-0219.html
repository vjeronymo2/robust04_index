			<p><P> January 25, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TONIGHT'S MEDFLY SPRAYING  </P> <P> About 9 p.m., state helicopters will begin spraying hundreds of gallons of a  malathion-bait mixture over 36 square miles in nine North County cities,  including virtually all of Garden Grove, half of Westminster and parts of  Huntington Beach, Los Alamitos, Cypress, Stanton, Anaheim, Orange and Santa  Ana. Two Mediterranean fruit flies have been found in the region.  </P> <P> Local residents concerned about the safety of the spraying are planning a 4:30  p.m. protest today at Garden Grove and Harbor boulevards in Garden Grove.  </P> <P> The next spraying for the area is scheduled Feb. 15. No further dates have been  set, but state officials say they may spray the area up to a dozen times by  summer, beginning every three weeks.  </P> <P>  State guidelines require door-to-door notification of malathion spraying in  English and Spanish, but do not provide for other languages. Community leaders  say that as a result, many Vietnamese residents in Garden Grove and Westminster  are ill-informed about tonight's spraying. The Times has translated into  Vietnamese the details of the spraying and what to do before, during and  afterward.  </P> <P> Los Angeles Times  </P> <P> BEFORE AND DURING THE SPRAYING:  </P> <P> Stay indoors if possible. Officials say the amount of pesticide used in the  spray is small enough that contact with it will not cause any long-term health  effects. It can be an irritant to the eyes, but no other short-term effect is  likely. The semisweet mixture of malathion and corn syrup is released in  droplets too large to inhale. Its toxicity is equivalent to that of laundry  detergent, officials say.  </P> <P> Cover cars parked outside. The mixture may cause blemishes or discoloration to  the finish or paint of some cars.  </P> <P> Keep dogs, cats, or other pets in garages or under cover.  </P> <P> Shallow back-yard fish ponds should be covered. Officials say pool owners  should not worry because the pesticide will not affect the water quality in a  standard size pool.  </P> <P> ABOUT THE SPRAYING:  </P> <P> The droplets to be sprayed are from a mixture that is about three-quarters  protein-corn syrup bait, to lure the fruit flies, and one-quarter malathion,  the pesticide being used to kill them. About 12 ounces per square mile were  scheduled to be applied over the target area.  </P> <P> Although the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has ordered new tests of  malathion, to try to resolve questions about its effect on human health, state  officials assert that it is "one of the safest insecticides in use today."  State officials say that the low doses used in aerial spraying pose no health  threat to anyone, including pregnant women, infants, children, the elderly and  the chronically ill. They also say that no one should have any reservations  about going outside after the spraying is completed. Animals with the exception  of fish, which are considered very susceptible should not be affected either,  officials say.  </P> <P> AFTER THE SPRAYING:  </P> <P> Friday morning, all patio furniture, play equipment, tools and household items  left outdoors during the spraying should be hosed down. If a car has been  sprayed, it should be washed with soap and water.  </P> <P> Source: State and Orange County agriculture officials.  </P> <P> Translation by Times staff member Thuha Tran  </P> <P> (Note: Vietnamese text not included)  </P></p>

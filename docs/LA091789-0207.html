			<p><P> September 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE ORCHESTRA'S SUBSCRIBERS: FIERCELY LOYAL, FINANCIALLY ESSENTIAL AND  SOMETIMES FICKLE;  </P> <P> PASADENA SYMPHONY;  </P> <P> SHE'S IN TUNE WITH PASADENA  </P> <P> They are the backbone of arts organizations, providing up to 90% of the  audiences and of the revenues. Most are fiercely loyal and willing to volunteer  their support, such as subscriber Betty Rockwell has done for years at the  Pasadena Symphony. But some are fickle, as the Master Chorale of Orange County  is discovering as the novelty of its new home at the Performing Arts Center  wears off. Even the mighty Los Angeles Philharmonic has a 25% annual subscriber  turnover rate. At the Pacific Symphony in Orange County, the goal is to retain  75% to 80% of all subscribers, and at 65% renewals this year it will be a  struggle. Why are subscribers so imporant? Single-ticket sales are "scary,"  says Deborah Rutter of the L.A. Chamber Orchestra, "because you never know how  you're doing until the last minute." As the 1989-90 music season begins, here  are five portraits of these key people, the subscribers themselves.  </P> <P> Betty Rockwell, a lifelong supporter of the Pasadena Symphony, grew up hearing  the orchestra and has followed its fortunes since she was a music and art  student at Occidental College in the 1930s.  </P> <P> A fifth-generation Californian with a longtime passion for music (she collects  musical instruments), Rockwell remembers how American women, as volunteers,  often ran their symphonic organizations in the days before professional  managers.  </P> <P> In those years, volunteer labor, sometimes even from orchestra members,  characterized U.S. symphonic life outside the largest cities.  </P> <P> Rockwell says that at one time -- around 1970 -- before Civic Auditorium went  all union, she arranged the subscriber seating in the auditorium. "I did that  for two years, usually working night and day," she recalls of the era before  computers when chores like seat-assignment were complicated manual jobs. Today,  thanks to electronics, seats are allotted in microseconds for the Pasadena  Symphony's nearly 2,000 subscribers.  </P> <P> Rockwell also served on the finance committee of the orchestra for 13 years,  was president of the women's committee for two, and treasurer of the finance  committee for four years.  </P> <P> "At the end of every season, we would get on the phone and try to convince  people to renew their subscriptions. Sometimes we had to do quite a selling job  -- people always had so many other choices, it seemed."  </P> <P> She has lived in Pasadena with her husband Bill since 1957. They have also been  subscribers to the L.A. Philharmonic -- where they have been Wednesday-night  subscribers for 25 years -- and L.A. Civic Opera, among other producing  performance organizations.  </P> <P> "I go to the opera and ballet, but my husband doesn't," says Rockwell, seated  in the quiet living room of her comfortable, Spanish-style home, not far from  the Rose Bowl.  </P> <P> "He loves the symphony, and grew up with it, but wasn't exposed to opera and  ballet."  </P> <P> From its inception in 1928, the Pasadena Symphony has drawn an audience made up  mostly of residents of the San Gabriel Valley. Even today, according to manager  Robert McMullin, "we have very few subscribers from the Westside, and not many  more from the San Fernando Valley. Our audience comes from Pasadena, South  Pasadena, Arcadia, Altadena and other nearby communities, like Glendale and  Burbank."  </P> <P> But that audience is loyal. When subscribers do not renew, says McMullin, "It's  almost never because of anything as controversial as programming. It's because  they move away, or find they buy a series of five concerts and are too busy to  attend more than one or two. Or because, as they grow older, some people choose  not to go out in the evening." Nevertheless, "This year our renewal rate is  about 80%." The cost of five concerts ranges from $50 to $110.  </P> <P> Over the years, the Rockwells have been close, Mrs. Rockwell says, to the  musical leaders of the orchestra, as well as to players in the ensemble. When  Richard Lert retired in 1972, the couple hosted the post-concert party honoring  him.  </P> <P> And she is still a close friend of former Pasadena music director Daniel Lewis,  as well as a great admirer of the current conductor, Jorge Mester. Rockwell  says she is proud of the orchestra's long tradition of bringing new and  contemporary music, as well as standard works, to its subscribers.  </P> <P> "I have a friend in Chicago who is well over 80. About listening to new music,  he says, 'I don't like it, but I want to know what's going on.' "  </P> <P> That's close to what Rockwell says about her own tolerance for contemporary  compositions.  </P> <P> "There are two things about new pieces. First, I want to learn. Then, I like to  stay young."  </P></p>

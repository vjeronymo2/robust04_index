			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Nancy Zamora] </F>   [Text] Madrid, 24 Mar (PL) -- Carlos Lage, vice president  of the Cuban Council of State, has described as positive his  working visit that concluded today in this capital city. During  the visit he met with Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez and other  high-ranking members of the Spanish Government.    Likewise, in exclusive statements to PRENSA LATINA, Lage  expressed his satisfaction with the current state of relations  between Cuba and Spain.    The high-ranking Cuban official explained the meeting with  Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez, which lasted an hour and  a half, allowed him to provide an in-depth depiction of Cuba's  current situation and the measures implemented on the island as  well as to analyze bilateral relations.    It was also an opportunity to evaluate Spanish investment  opportunities and perspectives in Cuba and the possibility of  expanding bilateral cooperation in various fields.    During his four-day stay, Lage carried out a very tight  agenda, which included meetings with Foreign Minister Javier  Solana, Economy and Finance Minister Pedro Solbes, and Commerce  and Tourism Minister Javier Gomez Navarro, as well as with Jose  Luis Dicenta, secretary of state for cooperation.    Lage also met with Carlos Solchaga, president of the Spanish  Socialist Workers Party parliamentary bloc and former economy  minister. The Cuban official also met with Rafael Portaencasa,  rector of the Madrid Polytechnic University.    We appreciate these meetings and working sessions giving us  the opportunity to explain the our efforts and how difficult it  is for us to progress amid U.S. pressures against other  governments and investors, Lage stated.    Likewise, these contacts, he added, allow us to enlighten  Spanish authorities on the expected Cuban successes in the near  future in certain fields.    According to Lage, this exchange of ideas and opinions is  also useful, because it offers the opportunity to provide more  information abroad about the country's progression.    Lage explained his visit to Madrid follows a visit by Jose  Luis Rodriguez, Cuban minister president of the State Committee  for Finance, who met with representatives of Spain's financial  institutions last week to discuss technical issues.    He said talks with financial institutions from Spain and  other nations have been taking place for several months now,  because Cuba is confronting a totally new situation in which it  must adopt economic measures. In this respect, Cuba is ready to  assimilate experiences and knowledge from other nations.    We are aware conditions are different, because, first of  all,  in our case they are occurring within a socialist context;  second, because Cuba's economic adaptation is taking place amid  the U.S. economic blockade, the Council of State vice president  explained.    In expressing an opinion on the results of his agenda during  the past days, Lage said it allowed an interesting exchange of  ideas with the leaders of the Spanish Government, which, in his  opinion, is important in many ways.    In this respect, he cited, among other aspects, the  magnitude  of economic exchange, bilateral cooperation, the possibility of  expanding the historic closeness between Cuba and Spain, and the  affinity as well as affection between both countries.    Finally, Lage said this contact with the Madrid Government  is  not an isolated occurrence, rather, something that will continue  to ensure greater dialogue and economic exchange between Cuba  and Spain.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Washington, D.C., 27 Mar (DPA) -- Costa Rican  Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus today angrily condemned the OAS  members who reneged on their promise to back his bid for  election as new OAS secretary general. Colombian President  Cesar Gaviria won the election.    Niehaus said: Costa Rica "views as very worrisome the little  respect that certain member states have demonstrated in these  elections to acquired commitments."    He said: "Costa Rica on several opportunities listed the  expressed backing it had, backing which was formalized in line  with the most strict norms of diplomacy. At the polls there  were some who simply discarded their word and honor, however,  without showing Costa Rica the most elemental consideration of  saying they were going to withdraw their support."    In leaving OAS Headquarters, Niehaus said until the last  minute he had written promises of support from 21 countries, but  received the votes of only 14. The original coalition included  the six Central American countries, the 13 Caribbean  English-speaking countries, and four South American countries.    Ecuador and Antigua and Barbuda, which had promised to  support Niehaus, publicly announced before the voting they were  going to back Gaviria, but because the voting was secret it was  not possible to establish what other countries concealingly  changed their votes at the moment of voting.    Niehaus accused the United States, not mentioning the  country  by name, due to its pro-Gaviria campaign. Niehaus accused it of  "exerting pressure and resorting to all sorts of mechanisms and  antics to force others into changing their votes."    He complained: "If this continues to be the OAS norm, it  seems it would be better to forget formalisms and just allow the  country at issue to continue to directly appoint the heads of  all the posts. At least in this way we would be saving time,  effort, rhetoric, and poetry about the respect accorded to  states' sovereignty."    Niehaus said reproachingly: "We must always remember,  however, a colony-type attitude by the weak is worse than an  imperialist attitude by the powerful."</p>

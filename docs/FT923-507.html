			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Europe's new horizons The 5 per cent fall in the German equity market last week owed as much to reduced expectations of corporate earnings as to the gyrations of the foreign exchanges. Recently estimates for next year's earnings growth have been reduced to around 5 per cent. Germany's GNP is now expected to rise only 1 per cent in 1993. The revaluation of the D-Mark against trading partners such as Italy and the UK may lead to these figures being revised down once more. Worries about an erosion of Germany's competitive position provide another explanation of its vigorous defence of the franc. While any benefit of devaluation has often been squandered by countries with poor inflation records, France has better anti-inflation credentials than Germany. It might be expected to exploit any price advantage. Indeed, France has already enhanced its competitive position over Germany since the last ERM realignment in 1987. Suggestions that the two countries are considering early monetary union thus make commercial as well as, arguably, political sense. France wants to protect its painfully-acquired credibility with the markets, Germany to prevent a franc devaluation eroding its competitive position. But should there be early currency union, German reunification costs may make the experience painful. Annual government payments to the east could be as high as DM170bn this year and may run on at a high level until the end of the decade. With high money supply growth and lax fiscal control the fall in German interest rates will be slow. Clearly the French government bond market would benefit from moves towards monetary union as convergence arguments reasserted themselves. Overall, yields in the DM bloc might fall as investors moved into a large liquid market with proven low inflation. But the equity markets would not fare so well. The German market has a heavy weighting in capital goods companies which would suffer in a prolonged downturn. And while France currently has an inflation advantage, it is not yet clear that its economy is strong enough for companies to take the strain in the longer term.</p>

			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / International Company News: Pfizer claims success for rheumatoid arthritis drug The first significant successes in slowing the progression of rheumatoid arthritis were claimed yesterday by Pfizer, the US drugs group. The company said that clinical tests of Enablex, a drug currently awaiting approval from the US Food and Drug Administration, showed it had achieved 'a statistically significant decrease' in the rate of joint deterioration in patients. The results of the tests 'presage a major therapeutic advance in the management of the crippling disease of arthritis,' claimed Dr John Niblack, the company's head of research and development. Full results of the trial will be presented at the annual meeting of the American College of Rheumatology this week. Pfizer also yesterday said that it expected to have 14 different drugs in late-stage trials by next year, setting the stage for a series of drug launches that would stretch beyond the end of the decade. Dr Niblack warned that some products might prove disappointments, but added: 'With this many shots, there are going to be a few goals.' The up-beat news, made at an analysts' meeting in New York, lifted Pfizer's share price by Dollars 1 1/4 during morning trading, to Dollars 74 3/4 . The company already trades at a higher price/earnings multiple than most competitors, reflecting its strong pipeline of potential new drugs and a series of successful product launches in recent years. In the latest quarter, to the end of September, more than half Pfizer's sales came from drugs launched this decade. Among other products with good potential singled out by Pfizer yesterday were Zithromax, an antibiotic whose approval the company is seeking to extend for paediatric use. Clinical trials had shown 'outstanding efficacy and safety data superior to competing products,' Dr Niblack said.</p>

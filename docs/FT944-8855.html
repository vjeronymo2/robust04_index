			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / Swedish Yes vote boosts Norway's pro-EU campaign: The referendum on entry to the European Union promises to be very close Ms Anne Enger Lahnstein, the popular leader of Norway's anti-European Union campaign, makes light of the Swedish 'slip-stream effect' on the referendum on Norwegian EU membership on November 28. 'I've heard that if Norway stays out, we will be left with Iceland, Liechtenstein and Lahnstein,' the leader of the main opposition Centre party told a crowded rally in an Oslo suburb this week. The embattled Yes camp is hoping that the Swedish vote last Sunday to join the EU will exert a strong pull, persuading many Norwegians to swing in favour of membership to avoid the risk of leaving the country isolated outside the Union. This much-talked-about pull effect on Norway goes by the somewhat risque term Svenskesuget, literally 'Swedish suck'. Beneath the veneer of confidence and the jokes, however, there are now clear signs that the Norwegian No campaign, which has held a commanding lead in the opinion polls for the last two years, is nervous that the tide has indeed begun to turn since the Swedish vote. In her appeal to 300 No supporters in the working-class district of Romsas, Ms Lahnstein acknowledged that the No campaign faced a tough battle. 'We have to mobilise our forces. The Yes side has decided not to lose this time. It is going to be one hell of a fight,' she said. Since the Swedish vote on Sunday, the Yes campaign has advanced significantly in the opinion polls, gaining up to six points to narrow the gap to around 55-45, with one poll showing the Yes vote rising to as high as 48 per cent. The No campaign, which fears loss of sovereignty and loss of control over Norway's oil and fishing resources in the EU, brings together the rurally-based Centre party, left-wing and environment groups, fishing communities and farmers. It hopes that most of the 'Swedish suck' effect has already played itself out. But the No campaigners recognise that the pro-EU forces, led by Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland's Labour government, have saved most of their resources until after the Swedish vote and are now pounding home their message that Norway must not be left behind as both Sweden and Finland go into the EU. 'We don't take anything for granted,' said Mr Hallvard Bakke, a dissident former Labour minister prominent in the No campaign. 'They may still win.' The government and its allies in the Yes camp - which include the opposition Conservative party and the vast majority of Norway's business and industrial leaders - believe the EU debate is shifting at last onto the ground upon which they all along wanted to fight. Instead of getting bogged down in detailed arguments about issues such as the effect of membership on Norway's influential fishing and farming sectors, increasingly the debate is focusing on Norway's political, strategic and economic role in Europe, and the potential loss of influence and investment it faces if it votes to stay outside - as it did in 1972 in an earlier referendum. Mr Inge Lonning, leader of Norway's European Movement, says he believes many Norwegians are uncomfortable with the notion that the country - a founder member of Nato - might take a clear step away from its central role in European security issues just as neutral Sweden and Finland move towards European security co-operation. 'Our task in the last 10 days is to get people to understand the political consequences of a No vote - Norway will take over a somewhat neutral position while our Nordic neighbours will move the other way,' he said. In these 10 days, the Yes campaign will be dominated by senior government figures such as Mrs Brundtland attempting to use the authority of office to swing the many undecided voters - just as Mr Ingvar Carlsson, the Swedish prime minister, succeeded in doing in Sweden. With the rural and remote northern areas clearly set to vote heavily No, the campaign will be won and lost - as it was in Sweden and Finland - in the urban areas and among the divided supporters of the Labour party, easily the country's biggest political movement. Both Yes and No campaigns are pouring resources into the greater Oslo area, which has more than one third of the 4.3m population, and the other big cities of Bergen, Stavanger and Trondheim. 'Both sides are frantic now because they know it is going to be very close,' said Mr John Harbo, one of Norway's most experienced political commentators. An against-the-odds victory in the referendum may yet be possible for Mrs Brundtland. But agonisingly for her, a win on November 28 may not settle the issue. Ratification of membership requires a three-quarters parliamentary majority. If the vote is a narrow yes, the Centre party is likely to seek to block accession. With 32 MPs of its own, the party could well gather enough support from leftist and other anti-EU members to win the 42 votes needed for a blocking minority. 'If we get a narrow Yes vote, the campaign is not over,' said Mr Lonning. 'We will face a tremendous fight to win in parliament.'</p>

Mr.  Krzhanitskiy, Ukraine's ambassador to Russia, will represent  Ukraine, which is participating in the conference as an observer.    As Ukraine's Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported, our state  is not taking part in creating, and will not join the system of  collective security. Ukraine's position is caused by its  legislation:    It does not join military and political unions, blocs, or  groupings. It was stressed during the Ministry of Foreign  Affairs' briefing that the creation of a system of security  parallel to NATO is dangerous and inexpedient. Ukraine is in  favor of global collective security on the territory of Europe.</p>

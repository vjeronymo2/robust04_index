			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 18 May (PL) -- The Higher Institute of  Sciences and Technology [Instituto Superior de Ciencias y  Tecnologia] today established an environment department,  dedicated to the use of nuclear techniques to preserve and  protect the environment.    Headed by Francisco Martinez Luzardo, a forestry expert and  chemist by profession who holds a doctorate degree in the  sciences of the use of residues, the department groups  radiochemists, nuclear physicists, and technologists whose  interests and research findings are related to the idea of  sustainable development.    Martinez Luzardo told PRENSA LATINA that the department will  promote environmental projects with stress placed on their  economic feasibility.    In addition to conducting a nuclear analysis of the  industrial waste and atmospheric pollution, the department seeks  to develop and apply technologies to treat residual and natural  waters and waters muddied with the waste of contaminating  metals, as well as to lower the risks of human error in  operating industrial processes, he explained.    The researchers discussed the main achievements in using the  residues of salt plants, sawmills, and nickel factories and  referred to the virtues of the products obtained: additives for  fuel, anticorrosive products, purifying resins, and others.    At present, the department is conducting a joint program  with  Rio de Janeiro and Roraima Universities in Brazil on the  protection of the environment, specifically on the use of  radiotracers [radiotrazadores] to analyze residuals polluted by  mercury.</p>

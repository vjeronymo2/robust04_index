			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report]  <H6>  SUNDAY TIMES </H6>   More of the Same--"The Transitional Executive Council [TEC]  is giving South Africans an unpleasant foretaste of what to  expect from a government of national unity if it is dominated  politically by the ANC [African National Congress] and the  National Party, and administratively by the existing civil  service," an editorial in the Johannesburg SUNDAY TIMES in  English on 30 January on page 18 notes. "In its brief existence,  the TEC has wrapped itself in secrecy" and not "proved immune to  other unsavoury habits of the Nationalist elites" such as  "currency fiddles," avoiding import duties and "the far-flung  pleasures of office"--foreign junkets. "As for the character of  the new democracy, the instincts of the TEC are less than  reassuring: much of its effort seems to have gone into  surpressing Radio Pretoria," the editorial notes. "Fortunately,  this phase of the transition is brief and, when the government  of national unity comes into power, the protections of the  interim constitution also comes into play." "But for the  constitutional safeguards to be fully effective, we need in  parliament as many people as possible who do not belong to the  cosy alliance that now dominates the TEC." "If the TEC is any  guide, the next five years will be similiar in many respects to  the past five, only more so."  <H6>  SUNDAY NATION </H6>   Talks Boycotters--"South Africa stands on the threshold of  what could be a major disaster as the constitutional settlement  reached at the multiparty talks is regarded as not being  inclusive by players within the Freedom Alliance (FA)," an  editorial in the Johannesburg SUNDAY NATION in English on 30  January on page 10 states. "FA groupings are demanding more  powers for the provinces and the abolition of a single ballot  system" in the forthcoming elections. "However, some parties who  oppose the one ballot system are either behaving hypocritically  or have themselves to blame." "Inkatha chose the old-fashioned  politics of boycott. It does not help the process of change when  we behave like spoilt babies and later cry crocodile tears when  our actions fail to derail negotiations." "If the IFP decides  not to contest the elections, what will be the purpose of  changing the one ballot system or even continuing to negotiate  with it?"    ANC Manifesto--The second editortial of the SUNDAY NATION  notes that the ANC's manifesto "looks like what the majority of  South Africans may have been looking forward to," but the  manifesto "is just a commitment and not the practical action."  The manifesto concentrates on "the improvement of the delivery  system" rather than "the availability of more resources. We  therefore believe that, if this is the case, there is nothing  unrealistic about ANC promises." "The manifesto sets a very high  standard for other parties that are still to unveil theirs. We  can only hope for better commitments which would make the lives  of our countryfolk better than the old days of apartheid."  <H6>  BEELD </H6>   ANC-Farmers' Agreement Welcomed -- "Pragmatism was in  evidence in the exploratory talks which took place this week  between the Orange Free State Agricultural Union and the African  National Congress [ANC]," notes an editorial on page 8 of the  Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans of 26 January. "While several  problems still remain to be resolved, according to the two  parties, the meeting has already produced positive results, the  most important being the undertaking by the ANC, under the  leadership of Mr. Patrick Lekota, to do everything possible both  before and after the election to ensure the safety of farmers  and their right to property." "Just like the ANC, the farming  community is a real part of the real South Africa. Both already  play an important role in the country, and can continue to do so  in the future." "Just as the ANC has recognized the rights of  the farmers to their land, and does not intend to drive them off  their land, so too the farmers must recognize the fundamental  rights of their laborers and other black and brown fellow  countrymen. For the Free State farmers it means that their  province, in which blacks form the great majority, cannot become  a white homeland." "Time and time again it has been shown that  negotiations between parties which are serious, and are prepared  to make pragmatic compromises, can succeed. The Free State  farmers can show their colleagues in other parts of the country  just what is possible."    "Enormous" Upliftment Task in East Rand -- A second  editorial  on page 8 of BEELD says: "What takes place in the war zones of  the East Rand goes largely unnoticed by whites. But this does  not mean that they or anyone else will not be touched by it. On  the contrary. The extent of the upliftment task waiting, both  social and political, is enourmous." "No normal society can be  created before the culture of violence has been defeated. No  political, economic, or social structure can remain in place  while there are people who feel that peace is a joke when they  have to live with murder." "We must remember that those are  human beings living in the East Rand, people who also desire  protection and a good life. No one can sleep peacefully while  they have such restless neighbors."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Yuriy Luzhkov, Mayor of Moscow, by Anatoliy </F> Pankov; place and date not given: "Yuriy Luzhkov: `I Have My Own  Addiction....'"]    [Text] Muscovites, of course, are interested in  knowing what awaits us in the near future, what the city  authorities are promising us, and how these authorities reacted  to the recent elections to the state and city dumas. And then it  turned out that this interview with the mayor of the capital  came about just in time probably for our happy holiday, to a  holiday of hopes and expectations of better days....    [Pankov] As we sum up the results of the passing year in  this pre-New Year interview, we cannot help but touch upon one  of the most influential events of recent days--the elections.  How do you assess the results of the elections to the State  Duma: as a defeat of democratic forces, as a recoil from the  reforms that are being conducted, or is everything proceeding  normally?    [Luzhkov] There is no simple answer. Indeed, a number of  parties with a centrist and democratic orientation did not  receive that number of votes that they were counting on.  Especially Russia's Choice. And it is necessary to talk about  the defeat of deputies of a democratic bent.    But Zhirinovskiy and his party unexpectedly received very  heavy support. Can this be called a victory? Yes, this is a  victory in the elections. What does it indicate? First of all,  the fact that the people are dissatisfied with shock methods of  reform, inflation, impoverishment, Gaydar's antisocial policy,  and the weak policy in this direction of Chernomyrdin's  government.    But the conclusions should be businesslike, and not like  Yaroslavna's complaining lament. I think that Chernomyrdin's  government can still be trusted, but it is necessary  fundamentally to change the team. To make not a shock policy,  but to move toward stabilization. To abandon the course toward  bad privatization, which will lead to a squandering of the  national wealth. And then the people will vote for democracy.    [Pankov] As the mayor, what are you troubled by most of all,  and with what kind of package of urgent questions do you intend  to submit to the city duma?    [Luzhkov] I would like to find out the opinion of the duma  and develop joint actions on questions of property in Moscow,  and its redistribution between the capital and Russia. We are  conducting a difficult and exhausting campaign for the right to  own and dispose of city property.    In the course of the last two years, numerous efforts were  undertaken to take property away from the city. The Government  of the Russian Federation proceeded on the basis of one of its  incorrect and insufficiently considered ideas that everything  located on the territory of the Russian Federation is the  property of Russia.    Policy in the sphere of privatization is still one of the  most important questions for the duma. I have already repeatedly  expressed my point of view: That which is being done in Russia  today in the privatization of property is a violation of an  owner's rights. There is no possibility here for compromise, and  for some kind of polishing corrections. We do not agree with the  basic principles in the evaluation of property, for the reason  that the capital is being put in a position without rights. The  year 1917 is being repeated, only the other way around. At that  time, property was taken away from the private owner and made  general state property, but now a real property owner has  appeared--this is the city residents and those organs that  represent the population, but Goskomimushchestvo [the State  Committee for the Administration of State Property] says: You  have no right to determine whether to privatize or not, it is  incumbent upon you--and that is all.    This is not only my point of view, but that of the whole  government of Moscow as well. And if the city duma supports us,  then I will be satisfied. It is necessary for the duma to  determine its own privatization policy in Moscow.    The normative base associated with the residence permit must  also be changed. We resolutely rejected the law that canceled  the residence permit in Moscow. And Muscovites supported us in  this. Although it would seem that now it is better for everyone  to look like a democrat, but we understand that nothing good  will come of it if we do not start to coordinate principles with  the realities of life.    [Pankov] Do you want to use the city duma in opposition to  the current staff of the Russian Government?    [Luzhkov] The city duma is 35 specialists of a rather high  potential (it is just that maybe not everyone understands the  city economy well, but there are those who do). And it must  independently determine its attitude toward one or another  problem of interaction of the state structures of Moscow and  Russia. I do not intend to impose my own point of view or, what  is more, to use the city duma to resolve these questions. I am  convinced that it will have its own position.    Now, your question already implies a certain confrontation  between the governments of Moscow and Russia. This is not so. I  repeat: The Government of Russia, especially after the arrival  of Chernomyrdin, is doing quite a lot to resolve Moscow's  problems. But every period requires its own resolutions.    [Pankov] In his postelection speech, Boris Yeltsin declared  that Gaydar would remain in the government, and this means that  the adopted policy on reform remains. Indeed, Chubays, "the  father of Russian privatization," is also one of the leaders of  Russia's Choice, and this bloc has a majority in the city duma.  Will it not happen that....    [Luzhkov] That does not bother me. Yes, Russia's Choice can  conduct its own political line in the duma. But I am convinced  that the deputies who are elected from various blocs must  conduct a policy to improve the life of Muscovites, and they  must make correct administrative, public, and social decisions.  And then it will make sense. But if we transform the duma into a  political discussion club, then we will repeat the principal  error of the Mossovet [Moscow Soviet of People's Deputies],  which occupied itself with Karabakh, the Dniester region,  Abkhazia, Sevastopol, and the Black Sea Fleet, but almost did  not work on questions of the life of the city.    [Pankov] It turns out that the mayor's office prepared the  statute on the duma elections, that the mayor's office financed  the elections, and that it organized and conducted them. Now the  executive authority is readying a building and arranging  maintenance; it has established salaries, assigned motor  vehicles, and developed regulations. And the reception was also  at the expense of the mayor's office. Well, will this kind of an  initial emergence of the city duma, seemingly from the recesses  of executive power, not have the effect that the deputies will  consider themselves beholden to you during a review of your  documents?    [Luzhkov] I am confident that it will not. You say that we  conducted the elections, but I would put it this way: We were  guaranteeing an administrative basis for the conduct of the  elections. But who else was supposed to do this? And note: The  mayor's office and the government of Moscow did not take part in  one or another candidacy for the city duma. We made an  announcement about our depoliticized position in this area, and  we conducted ourselves cleanly, without interfering in the  process of the elections. Now the duma is starting to work, and  it will make decisions by itself.    As for the questions that we proposed that the duma  consider--it does not have to accept them. Everything depends on  the objectives that the deputy corps sets for itself. But we are  not imposing them--let the deputies decide for themselves.    We are not at all striving to have a weak duma. The creation  has begun of an organ of authority that is absolutely  independent, with its own budget and with its own procedure for  putting its policy into effect.    [Pankov] How do you intend to build your relations with the  duma organizationally?    [Luzhkov] I want there to be regular meetings (once in two  or  three months) of the deputies with the government of Moscow to  consider the general situation in the city, or individual  problems. So that members of the government and the mayor should  participate in the work of the duma as competent representatives  of the executive authority. So that each member of the  government should set aside a day to meet with deputies. So that  workers of the executive authority should provide any  information, reference, analytical materials requested by  deputies....    [Pankov] One more year is coming to an end. Was it easier or  more difficult for you as the mayor than last year?    [Luzhkov] There are no easy years now. Each is difficult in  its own way. The tension is colossal....    [Pankov] But are you satisfied with the results of the year?    [Luzhkov] This is what I am not satisfied with. It was  expected that 1993 would become the year of stabilization. But  stabilization did not come about in industry (especially defense  industry), science, the VUZ (higher educational institution)  system, health services, and public education. We hope that we  will achieve this in 1994.    I am generally satisfied with respect to the city  administration. The promises that we made to Muscovites have  been fulfilled. We promised to introduce 3 million square meters  of housing, and we did. One million square meters of housing is  for those on the waiting list, and 700,000 is being sold at  auctions. The rest will go at normal prices to enterprises.    The construction complex has been maintained and even  strengthened, and it is planned next year to expand work on the  development of the municipal system. Everything will depend on  financing.    The tension with foodstuffs remains, but nonetheless, it is  not that acute. There are no more tobacco and other riots. But  the calm here is deceiving. The Russian Government planned to  take dangerous measures. For example, to increase customs duties  for imported foodstuffs by 30 percent. This is being done  supposedly to support domestic producers. But our agrarians  reacted instantly: They raised their prices by the same 30  percent.    There was a favorable extension of credit to Moscow for  purchases of foodstuffs. It, incidentally, did not resolve the  task of maintaining moderate prices in the city (Moscow is in  fifth place in the level of prices and yields only to several  northern cities). However, Moscow was deprived of favorable  credits in September, and this will make the situation worse.    Given all of the expenses and failures (in the work of  yardmen, for example), the city is provided with electric power  and heat, especially after the introduction of the Northern TETs  [thermal electric power station], work on the repair of roads  has improved (in three years the volume increased by a factor of  more than four!)....    As never before, a lot was done to strengthen the  material-technical base of the law enforcement organs. Now it is  only necessary to require the appropriate efficiency from them.    One of the most dangerous questions for us is rent. It is  necessary to resolve it to support a balance of financial  resources. It is an unpleasant question. But it is necessary to  act more quickly....    [Pankov] The year was also difficult for you personally: You  were ill, it seems seriously.... Do you not regret that you are  in the post of mayor as before?    [Luzhkov] I do not regret it. However, I have already said  that I am not clinging to this position, but I value the work.    [Pankov] But would you not like to transfer to the  Government  of Russia?    [Luzhkov] Categorically not! I will work here as long as the  Muscovites put up with me. It is better to do something useful  in Moscow than to fail in Russia.    [Pankov] But if you are not elected mayor the next time,  where will you go?    [Luzhkov] I will become a normal Muscovite, but I will work  in the same sphere that I have worked in all of my life. I will  continue to work on the introduction of new equipment.    [Pankov] The supposition has already been heard that you  might become a candidate for president of Russia. How do you  react to this idea?    [Luzhkov] Absolutely indifferently. And I emphasize: When I  talk about the need to renew the Government of Russia, I do not  have my own candidacy in mind. I do not want to go anywhere for  a promotion. I feel that I am needed in Moscow. Something  positive has begun to develop here. And I absolutely do not have  elements of unhealthy ambition. Well, everyone should have a  sense of personal dignity: A desire to work in such a way that  you are spoken of well. Therefore, I did not run for the State  Duma or the Federation Council. I am absolutely not interested  in this; I have my own addiction--Moscow.    [Pankov] But if Zhirinovskiy becomes president in the next  election? This will have an immediate effect on Moscow affairs.  Who will stop Zhirinovskiy?    [Luzhkov] If things will happen normally in each city, in  each oblast, and in each republic, then Zhirinovskiy will burst  like a soap bubble. And so it is necessary to work, to make  people richer, and to make Russians more worthy from the  standpoint of their position in the world. Then there will be no  place for any kind of Zhirinovskiys here. And there will be no  need for a superman to defeat the dragon.    [Pankov] What are your wishes for Muscovites for the New  Year? It will be the Year of the Dog. What, in your opinion,  does this mean--a dog's loyalty or.... a dog's life?    [Luzhkov] The Year of the Snake, the Year of the Monkey, the  Year of the Dog.... Why can we not live according to Orthodox,  and not Indochinese, principles? I am not going to associate my  desires with themes of a dog's plan.    I want Muscovites to be happy. I want it to be easier for  Muscovites to live and for them not to be burdened at least by  those troubles that our still unsettled city administration  presents them. Happy New Year!    [Pankov] And to you and to your family, good health and  prosperity and a good New Year's celebration!    [Luzhkov] Thank you.</p>

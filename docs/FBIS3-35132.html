			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Tehran Voice of the Islamic Republic of  Iran First Program Network in Persian at 1600 GMT on 16 February  broadcasts a 30-minute weekly news review program entitled  "Seven Days, The World." This week's program includes a  six-minute section on the 14 February anniversary of Ayatollah  Khomeyni's fatwa calling for Salman Rushdie's death for writing  the book The Satanic Verses.    After reviewing the reasons and results of the fatwa, the  announcer states: "A coordinated endeavor by the Western media  focuses on the revival of a current, a current which has been  practically buried since the issuance of the fatwa. Now, from  that defeated ploy, only a plaything is left which every now and  then comes out of its hiding-place, for a few moments, to create  propaganda fodder for the Western propaganda horns.    "In any case the conspiracy of the insulting book, The  Satanic Verses, was an insult against the beliefs and  sanctities of more than one billion Muslims which can never be  explained within the limits of freedom of thought and freedom of  the pen. The least punishment for a mercenary who carried out  that plot, is the irrevocable decree for his execution."</p>

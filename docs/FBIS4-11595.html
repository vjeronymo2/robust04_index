			<p>BFN     [Text] La Paz, 28 Apr (DPA) -- While the Bolivian  Government ruled out the possibility of decreeing the use of  force to neutralize the growing wave of protests by workers, who  are demanding wage raises, opposition congressmen today  interpreted the movement of military troops as a "virtual state  of siege."    Hugo Carvajal, deputy and leader of the Movement of the  Revolutionary Left (MIR), said the troop movement is a measure  "to intimidate citizens and prevent democratic demonstrations  against the government's economic programs. He said that the  government is desperate to apply measures such as the  capitalization and popular participation plan, which together  with the general budget, are not to the citizens' liking.  Carvajal maintains that the government is wrong to think that  it should apply the parliamentary-majority steamroller, without  reaching a minimum of consensus or engaging in constructive  dialogue.    On his part, Eduardo Paz, a Conscience of the Fatherland  (Condepa) congressman, said that Sanchez de Lozada is governing  with a stick in his hand, not only "hitting at the stomachs of  the poor," but also "repressing their democracy." He said that  the government is attempting to scare the people, making  military troops go out on the streets to face workers and  provoke "hours and days of bloodshed and mourning."    Meanwhile, Fernando Kieffer, a Nationalist Democratic Action  (ADN) Party deputy, said the government of President Gonzalo  Sanchez de Lozada "adopted the easiest way to intimidate union  leaders and repress workers." He noted that the Executive  Branch "is acting illegally in dispersing workers, who were on a  peaceful hunger strike, and ordering military troops to go out  on the streets without declaring a state of siege."</p>

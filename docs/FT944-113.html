			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / International Company News: UBS denies it offered deal to win 'shares' vote Union Bank of Switzerland has rejected 'unfounded rumours' that it offered a special deal to a large shareholder to win his votes at last month's shareholders meeting. UBS confirmed reports in the Swiss media that it had purchased a 1.45m block of registered shares, worth some SFr450m (Dollars 344m) at the time, apparently from a retired German billionaire. The UBS board sparked off a bitter proxy battle in September by proposing to convert the bank's registered shares into bearer shares on terms that would undermine the premium value of the registered shares. The two-thirds majority needed at the shareholders' meeting to approve its proposal was exceeded by only 65,500 votes, about 0.2 per cent of the 31.6m voted. Shortly before the vote, rumours spread of UBS buying a large block of its own shares under a forward contract. Swiss law prohibits a company from voting shares that it holds in its treasury. Under a forward purchase arrangement with the bank, the vendor could retain and vote the shares, but would no longer be exposed to any price risk. UBS said the majority of the block was committed to cover warrants and so could only be purchased on a forward basis. The terms were set 'in conformity with market conditions', apparently at about SFr310 per share, the price prevailing in mid October. However, the transactions were not reported to the stock exchange until October 28 when the spot price had fallen below SFr280. This has led to accusations that the deal was backdated in return for the vendor's voting support. UBS said 'no voting right agreements were negotiated'. It said the deal's terms were agreed on October 18, but settlement was delayed until October 28 because of the need to ensure that the transactions 'were properly executed'. It also said that it did not vote any of the shares it purchased on a spot basis. Mr Martin Ebner's BK Vision, which is taking UBS to court over its conversion motion, questioned again the use of shareholders' money to buy large volumes of registered shares when the directors knew that the price would decline. UBS said that, as a market maker in its own shares, it tried to smooth the fall of the registered share price. The appearance of a 1.45m block on the market threatened to have a very negative effect.</p>

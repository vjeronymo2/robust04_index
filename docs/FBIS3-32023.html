Department stores and  institutions in the capital are respecting the Chamber of  Commerce and Industry's call to shut down business from 28  January to 9 February in order to demand the lifting of the  embargo and compel the protagonists to find a quick solution to  the political crisis. However, the paralysis will not be total.  Capital supermarkets will be open to customers on Saturdays,  Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. Meanwhile, the employer  sector issued a statement encouraging the business people to  remain mobilized and united in order to thwart the embargo. Here  is the business sector statement:    [Begin unidentified speaker recording] The times are grave.  Our country is facing the most painful moment of its history.  The imposed embargo is proving to be an inadequate measure  doomed to failure. It is leading to total ruin, dividing the  nation and is not offering any solution to the crisis.  Twenty-eight months are too many. When, then, will a total,  general embargo take place? What would happen to our children?  What would happen to our environment? What would happen to our  economy?    As a first step, let us close our firms and let us stand as  one man to demand loudly and strongly the definitive lifting of  this destroying embargo. Through this ultimate sacrifice, let us  jolt national and international awareness. Let us continue to  unite ourselves in this movement of protest. Employees, workers,  state employees, professionals, you are a party to it. Your jobs  are threatened. Together, let us raise our voices of protest.  Join the groups and associations which have already shown their  solidarity. Together let us save our country, Haiti. [end  recording]</p>

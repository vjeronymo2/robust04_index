			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Rover 'committed serious breach' of EC rules ROVER, the motor vehicles subsidiary of British Aerospace, committed 'a serious breach' of European competition regulations by limiting its dealers' ability to offer discounts, the European Commission said yesterday. Rover made arrangements with its UK dealers that sought to limit discounts offered by the dealers on its Rover 200, 400 and 800 car ranges and on sales of Land Rover products. The arrangements, which were in breach of Treaty of Rome competition rules, were in place between about May 1986 and October 1990. The commission said yesterday that the dealer agreements were terminated when they came to the notice of Rover's senior management. The carmaker had voluntarily notified the Office of Fair Trading and subsequently the commission. Rover said that it believed that the restrictive practices had little commercial effect, but it had taken several steps to remedy the position including the provision of finance to start an impartial direct advice service for car buyers. It has agreed to implement an anti-trust compliance programme, is donating Pounds 1m to fund the two projects to benefit UK car buyers, has made a full and voluntary disclosure of the arrangements to the competition authorities and has agreed to reimburse dealers for any discounts which were withheld. It has also written to its dealers saying that it 'will not and cannot legally' discriminate against any dealer that 'has discounted list prices or has discounted them beyond any particular level'. Rover said yesterday it had agreed to fund two projects to be run by the Association for Consumer Research, the parent body of the Consumers' Association, and by the Research Institute for Consumer Affairs, an allied organisation. In the first project a database will be created to help consumers get better value for money, incorporating the latest information on dealer margins - and hence the potential for gaining discounts - EC car price comparisons and insurance and other running costs. The second project will provide new car assessments for people with special needs, in particular the elderly and those with disabilities. Rover is voluntarily funding these two schemes because it has been unable to identify either individual consumers who may have suffered financial loss as a result of its price discounting practices or to quantify the level of such a loss. Individual customers can still claim compensation against Rover or any Rover dealer, however, and it is still open to the UK competition authorities to take legal action against Rover. The commission has decided not to take legal action, however, because of the voluntary steps already taken by the company.</p>

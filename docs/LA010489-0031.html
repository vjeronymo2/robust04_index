			<p><P> January 4, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: CREST  </P> <P> A Crest man was booked early Tuesday morning in the slaying of his 67-year-old  mother, whose body was buried in her yard.  </P> <P> Ashley Victor Demers, 26, was arrested after the body of his mother, Anna Adele  Demers, was found in a shallow grave just 75 feet from the mobile home where  she lived, in the 2000 block of Old Bend Road. The body was so decomposed that  officials could not determine the cause of death.  </P> <P> Sheriff's deputies went to the woman's home about 4 p.m. to check on her  welfare after neighbors reported they had not seen her for several weeks.  </P> <P> When deputies arrived at the home, which appeared to be vacant, they entered  and found Ashley Demers inside. Demers reportedly said later that he had buried  his mother several weeks ago on the property.  </P> <P> Demers was being held without bail and will be arraigned at 10 a.m. today.  </P></p>

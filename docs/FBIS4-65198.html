			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Uta Wuerfel, FDP top candidate for the </F> European Parliament elections, by Karl-Otto Sattler; place and  date not given: "Without Tricks and Dodges"]    [Text] Without tricks and dodges Uta Wuerfel, the FDP  (Free Democratic Party) top candidate for the European  elections, enters the election campaign for the trip to the  polls on 12 June. Should the FDP fail also in the Euroelections  after the setbacks in Lower Saxony and Schleswig-Holstein this  would mean the political ouster for the previous member of the  Bundestag, who distinguished herself in Bonn particularly in the  conflict over Section 218. In the Euroelections in 1989 the FDP  barely survived with 5.4 percent.    [Sattler] In Lower Saxony and Schleswig-Holstein the FDP  slipped below 5 percent. In 1989 the German liberals reached  only 5.4 percent in the European elections. Is the ouster  imminent in the polls on 12 June as well?    [Wuerfel] We still have to make a great effort within the  next few weeks until 12 June. We have to make clear to the  citizens which policy the liberals plan to realize in the  European Parliament. We have to illustrate the potential  political loss if there were no longer any FDP delegates in the  liberal caucus in Strasbourg.    [Sattler] Many citizens consider Euroelections as internal  protest and teaching-them-a-lesson elections. Do you even have a  chance in the election campaign to emphasize European policies?    [Wuerfel] Since January I have appeared at 70 events  nationwide and I have found that interest is growing in European  concerns. The European Parliament has far more jurisdiction than  many citizens are aware of. For example, during my activity as  Bonn delegate I came to realize: Every second sociopolitical law  in Germany is based on an EU [European Union] guideline, and  German parliamentarians were not involved in the latter's  preparation.    [Sattler] Internally, the FDP is frequently elected in a  certain coalition context--as a procurer of majorities or as a  majority correction. However, in the Europarliament no  government is elected. How does the FDP plan to justify its  necessity beyond its small group of regular voters?    [Wuerfel] The rights of codetermination of the Strasbourg  parliament, expanded after Maastricht, have absolutely concrete  meaning to the citizens; the issues are the consequences of the  domestic market, health protection, consumer protection, women's  interests. In my view it is essential that liberal ideas have an  effect on these issues via the European Parliament. We need  energetic politicians who will prevent, for example, that the EU  medicine act erects obstacles in Germany for natural remedies.    [Sattler] Where, in fact, lies the focus of the FDP  Euroelection campaign in substance?    [Wuerfel] One thing is clear to us liberals: In view of the  global competition Germany, the economic site, can only be  secured at the European level. I consider issues of economic  policy a priority in the election campaign. European policy must  also be used to promote deregulation, debureaucratization, and  privatization. Particularly as a sociopolitician I know:  Whatever is distributed sociopolitically must first be worked  for by a strong economy. Therefore our Europolicy serves to  secure the site of Germany.    [Sattler] Foreign Minister Kinkel's role has been criticized  in connection with German-French dissonances. Does this also  damage Kinkel's role in the FDP Euroelection campaign?    [Wuerfel] I view as a great achievement Kinkel's negotiation  skill and tenacity during the EU expansion negotiations with  Austria, Norway, Sweden, and Finland. Kinkel could not tolerate  that the remarks of the French Ambassador Scheer damage the  position of the Spanish foreign minister as well. Therefore  Kinkel acted so forcefully, which is now being criticized by  some. Parisian Foreign Minister Juppe and President Mitterrand  have apologized for the behavior of their ambassador. The  irritations between Bonn and Paris have been cleared. Even among  friends it must be possible to call a spade a spade--without  affecting the friendship.    [Sattler] On which target group is the FDP focusing in the  Euroelection campaign?    [Wuerfel] In view of a growing mania for regulation I am  committed to promote the freedom of decision for people. The  bureaucratic constraint in many social spheres inhibits many  achievement-oriented women and men; it must be stopped. I am  addressing the achievement-elite starting with the skilled  worker and on up, the people who want to act with direct  responsibility and for whom solidarity comes before  self-interest.    [Sattler] If the FDP should fail on 12 June: What happens to  Uta Wuerfel? Then you won't come to Strasbourg, and you will not  be represented in the Bundestag any longer.    [Wuerfel] I can only appeal to the citizens to enable me,  through their vote, to support their interests in the European  Parliament. For me it was a question of personal credibility to  enter this election without tricks and dodges. My motive for the  candidacy to the Strasbourg parliament was the realization that  in the course of the European unification many decisions will be  made bypassing the parliamentarians in Bonn. If the FDP should  fail on 12 June I will no longer be able to make policy for the  citizens.</p>

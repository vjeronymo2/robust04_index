			<p>BFN     [Text] London, June 6, IRNA -- Hezb ut-Tahrir says that it  is inviting Muslims from around the world to a conference in  London to prepare the ground for the setting up of an Islamic  state in a Middle East country, yet to be identified.    The radical group is totally non-committal about its  organization or where it gets its claimed support that are said  to number some 2,000 members in Britain and unknown quantity in  other countries, which it is equally vague about.    Instead it speaks in terms of an estimated 12,000 Muslims  from around the world hopefully attending its conference at  Wembley arena on August 7 to discuss the past, present and  future of Islam.    Hezb ut-Tahrir was originally established in 1952, but has  been a largely dormant group until recent years, when it has set  up its stall as a radical Muslim group "differing from all  others." It also claims not to recognize any Islamic sects.    The shadowy organization is particularly tight-lipped about  where it gains its funds from for its campaigning, which is  rated as one of the most active on British university campuses.    Its main objective has been to feed on Muslim youths,  alienated from Britain's secular society, by appealing for a  radical agenda in high emotive terms but without any definite  aims.    The increasing public profile given to Hezb ut-Tahrir comes  at a time of a huge growth in Islamic splinter groups in  Britain, each with their own seeming agenda to defeat efforts  for a collective voice for Britain's 1.5 million Muslim  community.    The group in London is led by Omar Bakri Mohammad, a Saudi  Arabian, who receives his orders from Abdul Qadim al-Jlum of  unknown origins but who is said to be "somewhere in the Middle  East."    While the organization is discreet about its funding, it is  thought to have been revitalized to try to counter support for  the Islamic movement taking its lead from the Islamic revolution  in Iran, which it says it does not accept.    Its contention, claimed to be "purely ideological," is that  it wishes to bring down all Arab regimes to enact what appear to  be a "hidden agenda" which its members are reluctant to spell  out.    The main publicity for Hezb ut-Tahrir has come from the  Zionist press, which has voiced regular fears about its claimed  calls for the killing of Jews that have been strenuously denied  along with its often out-of-context quotations from the holy  Quran.</p>

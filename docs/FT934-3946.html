			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / NHS beds help win gobbledegook prize When is a bed not a bed? The National Health Service's answer won it a gobbledegook prize in the annual Plain English Campaign's awards yesterday. In a circular from the NHS's value-for-money unit a bed is described as 'a device or arrangement that may be used to permit a patient to lie down'. Beds that fail the test are those which are used for 'active intervention such as examination, diagnostic investigation, manipulative treatment, obstetric delivery or transport'. The Plain English Campaign, which collects nominations for its prizes throughout the year from members of the public, aims to 'stamp out small print, jargon and other nonsense from public information'. Other gobbledegook winners included a document from the trade union Unison, which takes 18 lines of memo to get round to saying that it recommends not making a recommendation. Winners of awards for clear, straightforward communication included the Inland Revenue for a leaflet aimed at encouraging people on low incomes to claim tax back on their savings. The Financial Times won the 'best national newspaper' category.</p>

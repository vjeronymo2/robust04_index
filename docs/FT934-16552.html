			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / Resignation puts spotlight on Mexican media THE limits to Mexico's new democratic reforms have been underlined by the resignation of a leading independent radio commentator, who says he was told not to interview prominent members of the leftist opposition party. Mr Miguel Angel Granados Chapa, one of Mexico's best-known political commentators, said the Interior Ministry put pressure on the radio station, Radio Mil, to block his interviews with opposition figures, and implicitly threatened to withdraw one of its radio licences if it refused. Both the ministry and the radio station deny there was any political pressure to censor Mr Granados Chapa. However, the allegations have fuelled concerns that the government will put pressure on the media to ignore Mr Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the candidate of the leftist Party of Democratic Revolution, in the run-up to next August's president election. Opposition leaders in Mexico are only occasionally interviewed on radio, and hardly at all on pro-government television. While there is a growing number of independent newspapers, many are subsidised by government hand-outs and advertisements that appear as articles, and as such are subject to political interference. The recently passed political reforms give opposition parties the right to buy television advertisements, and set limits on campaign contributions, but do not address government or media self-censorship. On September 20 Mr Granados Chapa broadcast an interview with Mr Cardenas. Immediately afterwards the owners of the radio station asked that subsequent interviews be cleared with them, Mr Granados Chapa said. The radio commentator resigned rather than accede to the request. Mr Granados Chapa said the owners had been pressured into issuing the instructions by the Interior Ministry. Mr Patrocinio Gonzalez Garrido, interior minister, said no pressure was put on Radio Mil to block interviews with the opposition, and insisted that radio and other media were free to interview anyone.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Taranov] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 14 TASS--"Strange as it may seem,  collective security problems assumed greater importance after  the ending of the Cold War", said Sergey Yushenkov, chairman of  the Defence Committee in the State Duma. He inaugurated on  Tuesday a round-table conference on "Topical Problems of  Collective Security in Europe".    "We all wish to make Europe more secure and stamp out  military conflicts that flared up in the territory of the former  USSR", he said.    Participants in the "round-table conference", among them  British MPs, noted that certain caution had become apparent in  relations between Russia and NATO of late. Russia and the West  have not agreed on any legal principles of the stay of Russian  troops in CIS countries, Russian expert Aleksandr Nikitin  pointed out. He believes a draft concept of collective security  of the CIS countries should be discussed by a meeting of the  State Duma. This concept should also be discussed with NATO  representatives so they could rightly understand the concept.    Member of the British parliament Bruce George said the  Partnership for Peace programme is just an initial step in the  establishment of closer relations between Russia and NATO. This  is also an attempt to prevent rapid integration of East European  countries in NATO to which Russia may react negatively.  Russia's joining in the Partnership for Peace programme will  lead to greater mutual knowledge and confidence. The  integration process can then be embarked upon, Bruce George said.</p>

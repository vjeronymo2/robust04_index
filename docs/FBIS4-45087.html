			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by P.N. Benjamin: "Foreign Policy in the Nehru </F> Era"; quotation marks as published]    [Text] Today (May 27) the nation observes the 30th  anniversary of the passing away of Jawaharlal Nehru. Nehru's  life and work cannot be studied in isolation. It is an integral  part of the Gandhian era.    Gandhi and Nehru guided the destiny of India during the  turbulent days of the freedom struggle. They represented  different facets of a giant nation awakening from a long  slumber. Gandhiji stressed the spiritual nature of man, while  Nehru emphasised unity within the family of man.    Their ideals and endeavours were never in conflict; they  were  complementary to each other. From this heritage flow the ideals  of democracy, socialism and secularism and a foreign policy of  peace and non-alignment.    It is rare in history that there is almost total  identification between a political figure and a certain policy.  The idea of non-alignment free from power blocs, as distinct  from the earlier concept of neutrality or the later pejorative  phrase `neutralism,' is associated both in its origin and its  evolution with Jawaharlal Nehru.    He anticipated the needs of the newly-independent countries  of a world dominated by very powerful systems. Because of the  nature of the Indian national movement and his personal ability  to articulate embryonic ideas, Nehru was able to champion the  cause of non-alignment in a most attractive manner.    The origins of the Indian policy of non-alignment have been  faithfully recorded in the speeches of Nehru and the documents  of the Indian National Congress throughout the Thirties. A study  of these documents proves how inevitable the policy of  non-alignment was after India became independent.    There was no doubt, from the very beginning, in Nehru's mind  that the essence of independence lay in the ability of the new  Indian State to take decisions free from any external influence.  He realised that while in internationalism economic relations  have to be built, those relations should not in any way take on  a character which would condition our political outlook and our  foreign policy.    Nehru was totally opposed to any kind of economic  co-operation that offended either the dignity or the prospects  of independence. That was his definition or understanding of  non-alignment in international affairs.    It was not as though he sat one morning and found out a  phrase. As he said: "Foreign policies grow, they will not come  out of a box or anything of that kind. Non-alignment, in brief  words, is simply the expression of national independence in the  sphere of international relations. An independent country has to  remain non-aligned. A powerful country seeks allies...., but a  country like ours which wants to be independent internally. It  is for us to realise that smaller nations, newer nations, who  are non-aligned, have also their ideas of independence."    Nehru realised and recognised that India had "no particular  mission in this world, in the sense, of trying to tell other  people what to do. But at the same time, she had the mission of  playing an equal, responsible and significant part in the  destinies of the world as any other; and, on account of our  size, on account of our importance, to do it as well as  possible."    Nehru was the first statesman of the world to recognise the  significance of Africa and he was one of those people who  anticipated that in far shorter time than even optimists dared  to hope that the great continent of Africa would become free.    In 1954, India was the first country to come forward and ask  for a standstill agreement in regard to the nuclear bomb. Nehru  knew that the stopping of these tests did not mean much. He knew  all about its effects not only on his generation but generations  to come.    Long before non-alignment figured in the international  affairs circuit in the mid-Fifties, India had become visibly  active in world affairs. The call for an Asian Relations  Conference a few months before the actual transfer of power was  daring for a government which was yet to find its feet.  Nevertheless, it reflected the irrepressible urge of the first  country to have broken out of the colonial yoke, to play a  purposeful role in international affairs.    More specifically, the government-level conference on  Indonesia that Nehru called in Delhi in 1949 bears testimony to  his interest, urge and determination that independent India  should be active in international affairs.    It is not necessary to go into a detailed study of all the  steps in the evolution of Nehru's foreign policy, but the  decision to remain in the Commonwealth, the active diplomatic  initiatives in Korea and Indo-China and championing the cause of  Egypt during the Suez crisis are memorable milestones.  Synchronised with these developments, was the continuous process  of the development of Afro Asian personality which had its roots  in the Asian Relations Conference and culminated in Bandung in  1955.    The success of Nehru's policy was due to his cool realistic  reassessment of India's own limited ability to contribute  effectively to solutions of problems. Inflated rhetoric without  any serious intention to translate words into reality was  repugnant to Nehru's mind.    An important feature of India's foreign policy during  Nehru's  time was that the Government's effort to inform and enlighten  the people on international issues.    In the early period of Indian independence, Nehru impressed  upon the people that great as India had been in the past and  hoped to be in the future, we could not exist in isolation as it  would be good neither for us nor for the rest of the humanity  without which we could not live.</p>

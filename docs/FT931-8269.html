			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Survey of Rhone-Alpes (8): Profits under pressure - Lyon is an important banking centre PARIS BANKS are feeling the squeeze in Rhone-Alpes as the economic slowdown takes full effect in what is one of France's most competitive regional banking industries. 'Until the end of 1991, we and many of our business customers thought Rhone-Alpes would escape the crisis,' says Mr Philippe Barriere, director of Banque Nationale de Paris' network in Rhone-Alpes, Bourgogne and Auvergne. 'Companies continued to invest and seek external growth and we contributed to this by lending to them. Now they are left with overcapacity. We were hit later than the rest of France, but we were hit hard. The more economic vitality you have the harder you are hit,' he says. Growth in both lending and deposits has slowed. Loans outstanding by French banks in the region grew by a mere 0.7 per cent to FFr303bn in the year to last September - a small fraction of the 14 per cent growth achieved in 1990, a year before the slowdown hit. The Banque de France says that the total of deposits at the region's banks rose a mere 2 per cent to FFr310bn in the 12 months to September 1992. Like their Parisian counterparts, Lyon's banks are also burdened by troubled loans on city property. They made made heavy (but unpublished) provisions on these, says Mr Bernard Rivier, deputy director general of the Banque de France's Lyon office. Demand for office property in Lyon fell by 25 per cent last year, while prices have fallen by up to 20 per cent for old buildings, 10 per cent for new ones, according to a recent study by Bourdais, the property consultants. 'All the banks have property investments. They have seen some difficulties, but they have been largely provisioned for,' says Mr Rivier. So it is no surprise that profit margins across the region's banking industry have been under intense pressure. Most of the leading players can stand the strain because they are owned by powerful national banks. But at least one independent operator has hit trouble. Only last month the Lyon-based development capital group, Societe de Developpment Regionale du Sud-Est, had to be taken over by Credit Lyonnais - the state-owned bank which owned 19 per cent of its shares - because of heavy operating losses and bad debts. Historically, Lyon's claim to be the region's banking capital dates from the 15th century, when Italian financiers set up shop there after escaping from the Guelph-Ghibeline civil wars of that time. Some are still there - indeed the Italian banking community is growing fast. Today the city hosts most of the 69 banks present in Rhone-Alpes, of which 23 are foreign, including eight Italians. While the intensity of competition makes bank managers' lives uncomfortable, it is a boon for both private and business customers. This explains why the region has more bank branches per head than the national average, and why Lyon has six market dealing rooms and the best developed supply of venture capital available outside Paris. Business loans in Lyon can even be cheaper than would be available in Paris, according to several local bankers. 'Because of the very fierce competition, our spreads can be lower in some cases than in Paris,' says Mr Yves Minssieux, regional director of Lyonnaise de Banque, France's largest regional bank, which is indirectly owned by the GAN state-owned insurance group. Indeed, the sophistication of Lyon's banking industry is one of the reasons why the city feels confident in its bid to be headquarters of the European central bank. As in Paris, the main banks are the three big national clearers: Credit Lyonnais, Banque Nationale de Paris and Societe Generale. Beneath them come half a dozen regional banks owned by national ones, of which Lyonnaise de Banque is the leading example. At the next level comes Credit Agricole du Sud-Est (Case), the giant co-operative bank which has taken market share from conventional banks since being given the right to lend to industrial customers (rather than only to farmers) five years ago. Conventional banks complain that Case's huge network - 251 branches in 10 departements - gives it an unfair advantage in access to cheap funds. Case argues that it is competing fairly because its costly structure - a federation of fully fledged banks with their own semi-autonomous administrations - means that its costs are higher than those of conventional banks. Then comes the recent wave of Italian banks which have not hesitated to undercut their Rhone-Alpine competition, especially in lending to the construction industry, the Italians' traditional expertise. Lyon has eight Italian banks; more than half, attracted by the growing cross-frontier trade between Rhone-Alpes and Italy's industrial north, have come in the past seven years, Recent arrivals include Banco Nazionale del Lavoro and Instituto Bancario Sao Paolo di Torino. Some of their Rhone-Alpes competitors have responded by co-operating, or taking equity stakes in an Italian partner. Case and Lyonnaise de Banque have done so, though the latter has curbed its international investments in recent years. Mr Joel Picard, deputy managing director at the Case, believes the competitive threat from Italian banks is containable. 'So long as Italian banks are coming to the region to accompany Italian companies here, they will have no problem, but I don't think they can do as well as we can on our own market. They have arrived here late, and at a difficult time,' he says. Overall, according to Mr Rivier of the Banque de France, the picture is of a strong banking industry, with high quality management, well able to ride out the economic downturn. 'So long as the crisis does not go on too long, I do not foresee any major problems,' he says.</p>

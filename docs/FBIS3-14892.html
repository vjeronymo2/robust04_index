Opening it, speaker of the Crimean parliament Nikolay  Bagrov said that the situation on the peninsula is complex and  that "we need to create normal conditions for the president's  work." Bagrov negatively assessed Ukraine's Supreme Council's  decision to hold elections to local state authorities on 26  June, the same date as the [Ukrainian] presidential elections.  Bagrov proposed that this question be raised at the session of  the Crimean parliament. The proposal by Viktor Bobylev, a member  of the Presidium, that the moratorium on holding a referendum on  the Crimean Republic's independence be lifted did not meet with  support.    The Crimean parliament's speaker touched upon the discussion  at the session of the question of forming the Crimean Republic's  budget. "If, today, the city [as published] must receive an  income of 700 billion karbovantsi, the question of the budget  will not be at all simple," Bagrov pointed out. "I very much  fear that once Ukraine has given us the chance to form our own  budget independently and does not give us anything, we will not  be able to survive."    Asked by journalists whether the Crimea will be able to  become a subject of international law, Bagrov replied: "This  topic must be removed from the agenda. Economic relations are  one thing, but political relations are something entirely  different."    Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov took part in the work of the  Crimean Supreme Council Presidium.</p>

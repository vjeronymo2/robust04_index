			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Correspondent Septimiu Roman report from Chisinau] </F>   [Text] From the republican commission in charge of  organizing and unfolding the sociological poll "What People  Advise" we have learned that so far, two-thirds or approximately  66 percent of the citizens of Moldova who have been registered  on lists participated in the voting.    In Chisinau the participation in the poll was about 39  percent, one of the lowest in the republic. We mention that one  of the reasons for this reduced participation in the poll was --  according to the statement by chairmen of several voting  sections -- the complex nature of the question, which, in fact,  included five independent questions that citizens had to answer  with a simple "yes" or "no." It is expected that tomorrow the  final result will be published.    President Mircea Snegur today granted an interview to a  REUTER reporter. Answering a question that referred to the  sociological poll "What People Advise," Snegur said that today  the Moldovan people emphasized their option by affirming their  legitimate will to live in a state that from a territorial  viewpoint is independent. The head of state assessed that the  results of the poll will eliminate the speculations of leaders  in Tiraspol regarding the intentions of the Republic of Moldova  to unite with Romania.    Regarding the statute of the 14th Russian Army, Mircea  Snegur  said that the forecasts and statements of certain people have  nothing in common with the official negotiations, during which  the representatives of the Republic of Moldova demanded the  withdrawal of the Russian military forces. In practical terms,  the terms of withdrawal are being discussed and a common  language with the authorities of the Russian Federation will be  found on these issues, said Snegur. He also expressed the view  that by joining the Partnership for Peace program, the Republic  of Moldova will become more secure, because the respective  initiative proposes to eliminate all possible tensions in Europe.</p>

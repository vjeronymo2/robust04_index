			<p>BFN     [Text] Beginning today, new sea and air transportation fees  went into effect nationwide following the 31 May publication of  Resolution 694 of the Ministry of Finances and Prices in the  Official Gazette. The resolution points out that children  younger than two years of age travel free -- proof of age is  required. It also stipulates that children between two and 12  years of age will pay 50 percent of the fee, in other words,  half the cost -- proof of age is required.    Beginning today, a Havana-Santiago de Cuba ticket costs 90  pesos, and a Havana-Baracoa ticket costs 108 pesos. Other  examples: a ticket to Camaguey costs 72 pesos, and a ticket to  Isle of Youth is 22 pesos. The hovercraft service between  Batabano and Nueva Gerona is 11 pesos for adults and 7 pesos for  children. The maximum luggage weight included in the ticket  price is 20 kilograms. Excess luggage, in maritime  transportation, will cost two pesos for each additional kilogram.    It is important for the people to be aware that this  measure,  which is part of the effort to correct the national finances, is  not enough to cover the subsidy which the state gives to the  national aviation carrier in order to serve the population. Air  transportation of tourists accrues hard currency, yet this is  not enough to cover the expenses incurred in transportation  services for the people.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Due to advancements in technology, many part 23 airplane installations now utilize equipment whose data sources are critical to the accurate and dependable operation of that equipment. The heated pitot tube is one such data source. The pitot heat indicating system will advise the pilots of any inoperative heating element in the pitot tube and that subsequent inaccuracies may result. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Part 23 airplanes certificated for flight under instrument flight rules or for flight in icing conditions are required by current &sect;23.1323(e) to have a heated pitot system or an equivalent means of preventing an airspeed indicating system malfunction due to ice accumulation. This proposal would require such airplanes equipped with a heated pitot tube to be equipped with a pitot tube heat indicating system. This requirement will provide greater assurance that the pilots will not be dangerously misled by faulty flight instrument indications caused by pitot tube icing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> When pitot tube heat indicating system requirements were added to part 25, the FAA noted the occurrence of at least one accident and several incidents in which an airspeed indicating error occurred that might have been avoided if a pitot tube heat indicating system had been installed. Part 23 airplanes operate at lower airspeeds and over shorter distances that do part 25 airplanes; therefore, their exposure to moisture and temperature conditions where icing may occur is higher than it is for transport category airplanes. Because of this environmental exposure, the potential for an inoperative heated pitot tube becoming a hazard to part 23 airplanes is greater. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposed requirement also responds to National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) recommendation A&hyph;92&hyph;85, which recommends requiring a modification to certain part 23 airplanes to provide for a pitot heat operating light similar to the light required by &sect;25.1326 for transport category airplanes. NTSB issued the safety recommendation, among others, as a result of a special investigation and analysis of a series of fatal accidents that occurred from May 31, 1989, through March 17, 1991. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 23.1329&blank;Automatic Pilot System <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> New &sect;23.1329(b), adopted by Amendment No. 23&hyph;24 (58 FR 18958, April 9, 1993), does not state clearly that stick controlled airplanes must be equipped with the same autopilot quick release controls that are required for airplanes with control wheels. This proposed revision of &sect;23.1329(b) would clarify that a quick release control must be installed on each control stick of an airplane that can be operated from either pilot seat. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 23.1337&blank;Powerplant Instruments Installation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposal would revise the heading of this section to reflect the powerplant instrument installation requirements that it contains. The difference between this section and &sect;23.1305 is clarified by this change. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 23.1337(b) would be revised by removing the wording that authorizes installation of only those fuel indicators marked in gallons and pounds. In countries that use the metric system, other acceptable units of measure for marking fuel indicators are used. This proposed revision would allow the use of any appropriate measurement unit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest (DDP/ADN) -- According to German Foreign  Minister Klaus Kinkel, Germany will continue to be the "patron  and advocate" of eastward expansion of the European Union (EU).  Therefore, this issue will top the agenda of the German EU  Presidency, which starts on 1 July, Kinkel said in Budapest  today, at a forum organized by the Friedrich Naumann Foundation,  the Hungarian opposition Alliance of Young Democrats (FiDeSZ),  and the Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ) on the subject of  "The Visegrad Countries and the European Union."    The successful regional integration of the Visegrad states,  Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland [as received], and  Hungary was a preliminary stage to EU integration, the German  foreign minister said. However, great efforts by all sides were  still necessary before these countries could become members of  the Union. Kinkel affirmed his proposal of a "Marshal Plan for  the minds," under which, among other things, thousands of  students from Central and East Europe should go to the EU states  and college teaching staff should be exchanged.    In the area of security too, integration rather than  exclusion was necessary. The correct way to achieve this was,  for instance, the "evolutionary concept" of a Partnership for  Peace, Kinkel said. In addition, association with the WEU  [Western European Union] needed to be possible in order to bring  the East European states closer to the European Union.</p>

			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / Business and the Environment: Coal cleans up its act for a power struggle - Spain is hosting an electricity project that could give new life to an old energy source It is far too late for the hundreds of thousands of coal mining jobs lost in Europe during the last decade, but for those still with jobs in the industry, a 335MW electricity project in the centre of Spain provides some hope for the future. Coal is falling from fashion - and production is down - in most European countries as concerns grow about the effects on the environment of the sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and carbon dioxide it emits when burned. Some power generators such as those in the UK are turning to gas as an alternative fuel source for power generation and others will follow their lead as international pollution standards are tightened. But that may provide a relatively short-term solution. Whereas there are plentiful supplies of coal worldwide, there is less certainty about gas, as its price is likely to rise. In any case, some countries have limited access to gas. With the building of nuclear plants politically difficult they want to maximise the possibilities for coal. Clean coal technologies such as those used in the Elcogas project at Puertollano, 200 km south of Madrid, is one way of doing this. Elcogas is a joint venture between 11 European power and engineering companies - Endesa of Spain and four other Spanish power groups (53 per cent of the equity), Electricite de France (29 per cent), Electricidade de Portugal (4 per cent), Enel of Italy (4 per cent), National Power of the UK (4 per cent) and technology suppliers Babcock Wilcox Siemens and Krupp Koppers - to build what they say is the world's largest and most advanced clean coal power generation project. It will use a technology known as Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle. Under this, coal is pulverised to a fine powder and then passed into a pressure vessel where it reacts with oxygen to produce carbon monoxide and hydrogen. Unwanted components are washed out of the gas which is then used to generate electricity in a combined cycle turbine of the type behind the growth of gas in power generation in recent years. The technology enables coal of any quality to be used for electricity generation at efficiencies of about 45 per cent, compared with about 40 per cent at an existing large coal-fired power station. In addition it will remove 99 per cent of the coal's sulphur and refine it to a high level of purity so that it can be sold for use in the chemical industry. According to the project participants, it produces only a quarter of the emissions of oxides of nitrogen and 15 per cent of the dust emissions of a conventional UK coal-fired plant fitted with dust control burners. The companies recently signed the financial deal that will secure the development of the Pounds 450m plant; construction is already under way. The plant will start operating in 1996, fuelled initially by natural gas but by coal in the following year. IGCC is more expensive than most other technologies, which means it is a long way from being commercially attractive in markets such as the UK which have moved a considerable way down the competition road. National Power says that taking into account both capital and fuel costs, a unit of power could be produced from an IGCC plant in the UK at 5.2p. That compares with 4p for a unit from a new coal-fired plant filled with emmission control equipment and 2.7p from a combined cycle gas turbine plant of the type the company operates in the UK. But from National Power's and other participants' point of view, the beauty of Elcogas is that it is extremely unlikely to lose them money. One reason is that the project has received a subsidy of about Pounds 50m from the European Union's Thermie fund to promote clean combustion technologies for coal and other solid fuels. But the main bonus of Elcogas is that the Spanish electricity system, encouraged by a government keen to find a use for Spanish coal, guarantees a financial return for the project, provided it produces the expected amount of electricity. There is little to suggest that production expectations will not be met since the IGCC technology has been successfully tested at other, if smaller, plants run by the petroleum industry. Shell has been at the forefront of IGCC technology and it is showing its confidence in it by building a large plant in the Netherlands. Carlos Lopez-Cacicedo, National Power's director of research and engineering, said his company had considered a number of clean coal technology schemes but that none had provided Elcogas's combination of low risk and advanced technology. 'This is the best technology which exists and we can be confident of getting a return on our investment, even if it is modest,' he said. Lopez-Cacicedo said it was unlikely that IGCC could become fully competitive in the short term but tightening environmental controls and pressure on gas prices beyond the turn of the century could change this position. 'It could just be coal's way back into the power generation market in the early part of the next century.'</p>

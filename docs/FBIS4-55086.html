			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by Croatian President Franjo Tudjman with </F> foreign and domestic correspondents at the Presidential Palace  in Zagreb -- live]    [Text] [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. President, some  progress seems to have been made at the talks in Vienna. Is  your visit to Sarajevo linked with the outcome of the talks?    [Tudjman] I believe that the two delegations will reach an  agreement on the implementation of the Washington agreement. My  visit to Sarajevo does not depend [Tudjman laughs] on the Vienna  talks. It depends on technical reasons. As you know, I am  ready and I was ready to go but this depends on UNPROFOR [UN  Protection Force] and other factors.    [Al-Isa] Nada Al-Isa, Bosnia-Herzegovina Radio-Television.  Mr. President, Croatian press has carried a statement by  Kresimir Zubak [Bosnian Croat leader] in Vienna. I am confused  by what Mr. Zubak said: That Mostar will be the most difficult  issue as far as borders between cantons are concerned. I am  asking you this because so far Mostar was supposed to be under  EU administration as a single city.    [Tudjman] I do not know about this statement by Zubak. Of  course Mostar should be under EU administration, but it should  also be the capital of the Herzegovina canton, i.e., of the  grand county of Herzegovina. This is probably being discussed  now and I believe that the delegations will reach an agreement.    [Rexepi] Adrijana Rexepi, Deutsche Welle. Mr. President, in  an interview for Pristina's ZERI, Josip Manolic, the chairman of  the Chamber of Counties, commented on a statement you made three  years ago that Kosovo was Serbia's internal problem. Manolic  said that this was part of a deal you made with President  Milosevic and that since then Albanians in Croatia could not  regulate their documents and their status. Can you tell us what  all this is really about?    [Tudjman] It is about a basic principle according to which  the status of all ethnic groups in certain states should be  solved within those states in line with international  conventions. Nothing else is involved.    [Unidentified correspondent] [name indistinct] of the  Russian  news agency ITAR-TASS. Mr. President, the situation near Brcko  is very tense. What is your prediction? Is this area really  going to be decisive for the war in Bosnia?    [Tudjman] Yes, the situation around Brcko does give cause  for  genuine concern. But in view of the open involvement by the  international community, including the United Nations, I believe  that the complications of war [zapetljaji rata] will be avoided.  This is, however, not totally certain but I personally expect  that if the Serb forces launch their offensive the international  community and the United Nations will respond in a more resolute  way than has been the case so far.    [Baratez] Mr. President, Zeljko Baratez, GLAS SLAVONIJE: Is  Croatia going to do something to stop the further export of oil  from Djeletovci [Serb-held oil field in eastern Slavonija] and  to prevent the aggressor from destroying the evidence of his  crimes in eastern Slavonija? We know that they have been  filling up mass graves with soil and taking bones elsewhere.  Thank you.    [Tudjman] Croatia will continue to place firmer demands  before the international community on the way UN Security  Council resolutions should be implemented unless the Serb side  shows readiness to adhere to the agreement on normalizing  relations, normalizing Croat-Serb relations within Croatia and  on normalizing relations between Croatia and Serbia. In other  words, if there is no sign of their readiness -- and so far we  have unfortunately had no such signs -- Croatia will  understandably take steps at a diplomatic level and elsewhere to  ensure that the issues you raised are tackled and that there is  a speedy integration into the constitutional and legal system of  Croatia of the Croatian areas now under the protection of the  peace forces, or rather under Serbian occupation.    [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. President, how do you  comment on parliamentary events and what will happen at the  forthcoming session? Will Mesic and Manolic resign and who will  replace them?    [Tudjman] One thing should be clear about the events in  parliament. Attempts by those who wanted to create a  parliamentary and a constitutional crisis failed. This was the  goal of Mesic and Manolic when they formed their new party. The  Croatian Democratic Union remains a majority party, with an  absolute majority in both chambers of parliament. It can be  expected that this so-called parliamentary crisis will be solved  in a democratic, parliamentary manner. Croatia is organized as  a state with a multiparty parliament, and according to all  parliamentary and multiparty principles the chairmen of the  chambers [Mesic and Manolic] must be from the ranks of the party  that has the majority in parliament. It is normal to expect  Mesic and Manolic to accept the democratic principles and that  an agreement will be reached through a parliamentary debate  between party representatives. This should be solved in a  parliamentary, democratic, civilized manner and, of course, if  this should not be the case the majority party can make certain  changes in line with the Constitution -- changes that serve to  preserve a democratic, parliamentary system.    [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. President, will the kuna  [new Croatian currency] be introduced on the occasion of  Statehood Day [30 May], and can you tell us more about the name  kuna [marten]? Many say that that was the name of the currency  used during the NDH [Neovisna Drzava Hrvatska -- Independent  State of Croatia during World War II] and stress its'  association with the then Fascist regime. Mr. Manolic even  said: Why not call it the zec [rabbit] or the lisica [fox]?    [Tudjman, laughing] Well, I honestly have neither read about  nor heard that piece of witticism. I know that when we  discussed the name of the Croatian currency there were people  who were against it. However, following the very serious debate  we had in both political and scientific circles we decided to  give the name kuna to the Croatian currency. Why? Well,  because the animal was used for payments in kind from the 11th  century. If I am not mistaken, the name kuna was first  mentioned in documents as a means of payment in kind in 1018.  It was used throughout Croatia, and not just in Slavonia but  right down to the island of Cres. Also, another point: Marten  was used as the means of payment in kind in a large part of the  world, from Russia to Canada. Marten was not just used for  payments in kind but also as a currency. There are documents  that indicate that in the 13th century the fur of one marten was  equal to 10 dinars. In addition, the majority of European  currency names, such as the Latin currency and the English  pound, the German mark, and the Italian and French currencies  date back to barter trade.    So, by naming our currency after what was used in Croatia as  means of payment in kind we are merely following the European  tradition in naming national currencies.    Such a statement -- that the currency should be called the  zec or the lisica -- is slightly surprising, and dare I say  frightening -- coming as it did from people who frequently  appear on the political scene, since these names have no  historical background while the name kuna has. It is even more  surprising that statements against the kuna have come from  university professors.    In other words, kuna [the animal] was not just a means of  payment in kind but was also depicted on Croatian money during  the Croatian-Hungarian union, on its coins. The kuna is on the  coat of arms of one of the three Croatian kingdoms, i.e. of the  kingdom of Slavonia -- there is a kuna on the coat of arms of  the kingdom of Slavonia. At some stage in history the kingdom  of Slavonia was synonymous with Croatia. Consequently, linking  the kuna only with the NDH is not wise at all. On the contrary,  it shows petty politics and an attempt to discredit the Croatian  democratic authorities.    Speaking about that, we should remember that after its  establishment in 1939, the Province of Croatia [Croatian part of  the Kingdom of Yugoslavia] also wanted to introduce a Croatian  currency and planned to call it kuna. Artist Kerbic made  prototypes of the currency called kuna or banica, but all this  did not happen because the then Croatian political authorities  were not sovereign, and there were conflicts about the currency  issue.    When we discussed the problem of naming the new Croatian  currency we considered all that. We considered the tendency in  Europe and Croatia to develop the names of national currencies.  We concluded that there was no reason why nowadays, when we  have an independent, sovereign, autonomous Croatian  state...[pauses] that today we can give the Croatian currency  the name that has the greatest tradition in Croatia as a means  of payment both in kind and as a currency. The fact that the  name was in use during the Second World War in a Quisling regime  that functioned within Hitler's new European order -- other  European countries now also have currencies that they had  before, during the Second World War.    When we created the independent sovereign Croatia, we wanted  finally to give the right name to the Croatian national  currency. All the more so because that name is very easy to  pronounce here and abroad and because it is unique. There is no  name similar to that. When for a while we considered the name  kruna [crown], we concluded that we are not a kingdom -- after  the loss of the medieval kingdom we had no independent Croatian  kingdom -- and that there are many currencies called kruna in  Europe -- Czech, Norwegian, Swedish, and all sorts of krunas in  Europe. The kuna will be the unique Croatian currency.    Consequently, all historic and political reasons were in  favor of the name kuna. We thus displayed political and  national maturity, and the determination to defend our historic  traditions and the interests of the sovereignty of the Croatian  nation.    Academician Brozovic is preparing a special monograph on  that  issue -- I think it will be published soon. All this will be  explained. I believe that we can be happy and proud that we are  introducing a new Croatian currency along our true traditions,  and also in line with the tradition of naming national  currencies in European countries.    [Segoje] Zvonimir Segoje, Hrvatski Vjesnik, Vinkovci and  Zadar. When the war ends with Serbia's military defeat, Serbia  will have to pay reparations. It is obvious that they [the  Serbs] will not be able to pay. Serbia set an example [of  getting reparations paid in some other way] when it got the area  of Stubica from Bulgaria after the First World War, instead of  the reparations. We respect the post-Second-World-War borders,  whereby the historic Srijem and Boka Kotorska are outside of  Croatia. Will we ask for Srijem, Boka Kotorska, and perhaps a  part of Backa instead of the reparations?    [Tudjman] The reparations would certainly be justified for  historic and other reasons. But, we also must bear in mind that  we are living in a different world today. We are living in a  world where the new order that is being created does not accept  violent changes of state borders. This world wants to secure,  within existing states, national rights for other nations and  national minorities. I am afraid that we would not get any  support for such demands in the present democratic world, that  we could cause unwanted consequences. But, Croatia will  certainly bear in mind the destruction that was done, it will  bear in mind its rights and will set some demands before the  international community, which we think are justified and for  which Croatia could get support from the international community  in which we have to live.    [Unidentified correspondent] I presume that you know what is  happening at the Vienna talks. It has been reported that some  kind of result will be achieved by 1400. Can you confirm this,  and is it true that the issue of who will be the president of  Bosnia in the first 12 months is an obstacle for the talks?    [Tudjman] I believe that the delegations will find a  solution, as I have said. As far as the main issues regarding  the setting up of the federation and the confederation [of  Bosnia and Croatia], the issue of who will get the top posts,  should not be vital. However, what is vital is to immediately  start implementing the principles we have agreed upon at the  talks we have had so far, including the Washington agreement we  signed. This agreement says that the prime minister and the  president of the federation cannot belong to the same nation in  the same term. Therefore, the Croats are not making any  exclusive demands. The Croatian delegation just wants the  agreement -- the agreement that was reached under the auspices  of the United States and the international community, they want  the agreement and its implementation to be respected.    I believe -- and as far as I know from the reports last  night  -- I believe that the agreement has been reached.    [Heinrich] President Tudjman, I am Mark Heinrich from  REUTER.  Can you tell us, according to your information, how many  deputies from the HDZ [Croatian Democratic Union] have joined  the new party set up by Mesic and Manolic, and do you think that  more deputies will change party ranks?    [Tudjman] According to evidence so far, of 85 HDZ deputies  in  the Chamber of Deputies, seven joined Mesic and Manolic.  Therefore, that does not bring into question the absolute  majority of the HDZ in the Croatian Parliament. According to  parliamentary principles, even the party that has a relative,  rather than an absolute majority, has the right to appoint the  presidents of the assembly chambers, that is, to have  proportional influence in the parliament.    Consequently, precisely because we cannot even speak about a  rift in the majority party, but only about the departure of  several deputies, I think that the changes caused by this will  be dealt with at the next session in a normal, democratic way.  As I said before, I expect -- and there are indications that an  agreement will be reached between the heads of parliamentary  delegations in the Assembly, and that this will be carried out  in the usual parliamentary fashion. After all, those gentlemen  always invoke democracy and democratic principles, so we can  expect that they will abide by those principles.    All the more so because we live at a time -- you raised the  question of a possible war around Brcko, so it is possible that  the situation will further deteriorate in that area -- when we  need a stable constitutional and political system in Croatia.  The question inevitably arises as to who would need the  destabilization of the democratic Croatia, the destabilization  of the Croatia that the world, Europe, the United States, and  the international community need as a stable country.  Therefore, I expect that in this context this problem will be  solved in a normal democratic way.    [Modric] Sanja Modric, Novi List. Mr. President, this year  you took part in the 1 May celebrations in the Maksimir park,  which was very well received by the people. Do you perhaps  intend to take part in the celebration of [the anniversary] 9  May at the Square of the Croatian Great today, organized by  several associations of citizens?    [Tudjman] No, I personally will not be there. But, my  participation in Maksimir was not a gesture of particular  importance, I have been to Maksimir before. That was the Labor  Day of all citizens of the world, and also of Croatian citizens.  I am, of course, the president of all Croats and all [Croatian]  citizens, regardless of their party allegiance. Croatia will  continue to function this way in future.    [Correspondent] [name indistinct], HTV [Croatian TV]. I  would like to refer back to the Square of the Croatian Great.  Recently there has been an increasing number of demands to  change the name of the square back to its original name -- the  Square of the Victims of Fascism. Can you give us your comment  on this?    [Tudjman] Well, such demands have also reached me. It is  interesting that they were linked with the problem of the kuna,  which I have already mentioned. No, the Square of the Croatian  Great will not be renamed again to the Square of the Victim of  Fascism, because we created the democratic modern Croatia on the  reconciliation of the divided Croats. If we had left the Square  of the Victims of Fascism we would have had to rename one of the  main Zagreb squares the Square of Victims of Communism --  because there were no fewer victims of Communism than of Fascism  in Croatia.    Let us build our democratic Croatia on the tradition of both  anti-Fascism, the Croatian anti-Fascism -- for Croatia gave a  larger contribution to the anti-Fascist struggle in the Second  World War than any other peoples of the former  Yugoslavia...[pauses] But Communism also inflicted a large  number of victims on Croatia. We were trying to bring together  the divided, opposed Croats, and through this reconciliation we  created a democratic, modern Croatia -- and we will continue  with such a policy, and not divide the people with some squares  of the victims of Fascism and Communism etc.    I have also personally recommended to the mayor of Zagreb to  call Dotrscina -- an area where Croatian anti-Fascists were  indeed killed -- the Square or the Field of the Victims of  Fascism.    On the day of our statehood we will inaugurate the monument,  or rather the Altar of the Croatian Homeland in Medvedgrad.  This will be a location where we will pay our respects to all  the victims from our history, regardless of which side they were  on when they died for Croatia, Croatian freedom, the Croatian  homeland.    [Ramljak] Olga Ramljak, SLOBODNA DALMACIJA. We have often  mentioned the Vienna agreement here. We have said nothing about  the agreements -- which were set in motion and then stalled,  stalled quite seriously -- between Croatia and representatives  of Serbs from the so-called Krajinas. Instead we have witnessed  situations in which the Croatian Army has fully complied with  the signed agreements and has withdrawn but the refugees have  not returned. There is no chance of them returning in the near  future. What is the obstacle that stalled these negotiations?  To what extent will they be affected by the latest situation in  parliament and those negotiators who have been criticized by the  public? What is the latest situation? What kind of hope can  refugees have in the light of the current situation?    [Tudjman] The latest development is the fact that instead of  implementing the agreement on normalization and the Serb side's  political promises that it would embark on normalization, it has  hardened its' positions to the effect that Krajina is something  special and that it will no longer be returning to Croatia.  This is a truly new development. We do take this into account.  This hardening position has probably emerged in parallel with  the hardening positions in Bosnia, that is with the open and  escalating questions in Croatia's occupied areas for as long as  the Bosnian question remains unsolved. [sentence as heard]    We have made it clear, we are still making it clear, both to  the Serbian side and the international community, that we remain  committed to the principle of necessary normalization in  relations, to the need for and the feasibility of a political  solution. We are, however, not going to tolerate delays in  resolving the incorporation of the Croatian territories  protected by the peace force, i.e. under Serbian occupation. We  must start resolving the problem of enabling the refugees to  return. If we do not succeed in implementing this agreement on  normalization with the Serbian side with the help of the United  Nations and the international community, then we will have, on  our part, to take every step in order to secure the return of  refugees and the incorporation of this area into Croatia. Our  public, as well as the Serbian side and the international public  must rest assured that we will do so.    As far as this question is concerned we will, of course,  bear  in mind the question whether those who have negotiated so far  have fully carried out their task, whether they are trusted by  the public, as you put it. In any case I have already decided  that Djordje Pribicevic should take part in the negotiations,  i.e. take part in the team. It remains to be seen whether there  will be any other problems.    [Ramljak] Is there any chance of people who are real  refugees  being directly included in the negotiating team? Perhaps,  someone who is a member of the refugee community.    [Tudjman] If this were purposeful, we could indeed do so.  Let us be realistic, though, in this respect. Someone from the  ranks of refugees might represent the interests and views of his  own area. One should instead resolve these problems as a whole.  It has turned out that it is impossible to have a large number  of negotiators because it is impossible to find solutions.  Understandably, yes, if this were purposeful, if we found such  a justifiable suggestion accepted by me and the Croatian  Government.    [Ramljak] Excuse me once again, I would like to ask  something in connection with the last question. Mr. Mikelic  speaks about a new territorial organization of Krajinas. Mr.  Martic says that they will defend the Posavina corridor. Mr.  Prijic says that the line of separation is practically a state  border. Mikelic says that they have started an economic  recovery in Krajina. Will the Croatian side take some concrete  steps if the Serbs move from words to deeds?    [Tudjman] I think I answered all your questions a minute  ago.  Of course, we must take into consideration these irresponsible  -- not to say anything worse -- statements by representatives of  the Knin Serbs. We have pointed out to the international  community that the problem is in Belgrade, that this is  Belgrade's occupation -- a Serb, a Yugoslav occupation -- of  those areas, because they provide them not only with money and  documents which state that Knin is part of Serbia, but also with  weapons and so on. In that respect, we will take all measures  -- both through the international community and internally -- to  bring such behavior to an end.    I repeat, if we fail to achieve a political solution within  the framework of the agreement on normalization and clear  statements of all international factors -- from UN Security  Council resolutions to statements by representatives of the  world's most important powers from the United States, China, and  even Russia which recognize Croatia's territorial integrity --  then, naturally, Croatia will have to take different steps.  But, of course, then we will have -- I hope -- the political  support of the international public, which is not ready to  accept an armed liberation of those areas prior to all political  options being exhausted.    [Correspondent] [Name indistinct], VECERNJI LIST. You have  said that seven deputies would follow Manolic and Mesic. You  have recently said that about 1 percent of the HDZ would leave  with them. Do you still think the same?    [Tudjman] Yes, I do. It is obvious that a bit more than 1  percent of deputies have left. I still say that not more than 1  percent of the HDZ members will leave. In turn, a significantly  larger number will join the HDZ. This is already happening in  all counties, and in the diaspora. We have received hundreds of  cables and letters of support for the central HDZ policies and  the state policy. These messages say that their [Mesic's,  Manolic's] departure will in fact strengthen the HDZ, its  central policy adopted at the second HDZ assembly.    Among hundreds and hundreds of letters, only one was against  [the central HDZ policies]. You know what it says, what he [the  author] finds important! He says: As a HDZ member I also join  Manolic and Mesic because I cannot accept the decisions of the  second HDZ assembly, because I cannot accept the new name of the  Croatian currency, and because I disagree that God Save Croatia  should be the HDZ anthem. So these are the reasons then  [Tudjman laughs] why this single one among hundreds of letters  agrees with Mr. Manolic. I believe that these hundreds of  letters reflect the general mood, not among hundreds but among  thousands and tens of thousands of HDZ members and among those  who are not its members. All this indicates that the HDZ, as the  central democratic Croatian party, will continue to gain  strength.    [Kuzmanovic] Jasmina Kuzmanovic, AP. Mr. President, last  week the United Nations explicitly called -- for the first time  -- on the Bosnian Army to steer clear of the corridor. They  called on both the Serbs and the Bosnian Army to steer clear of  the Brcko area. It is a fact that the corridor is vital for the  Serbs as it links the occupied areas of Bosnia and Croatia to  Serbia proper. It is also a fact that there have been  difficulties and problems in the talks between Croatia and  Serbia and Croatia's Serbs. What is your comment on this move?  Does this amount to the creation of some new UNPA [UN protected  area] zone in Bosnia?    [Tudjman] I believe that, having experienced all their  bitter  lessons in seeking a solution to the Bosnian crisis,  international factors have drawn the conclusion that neither  side should be allowed to spread the war. After all, the  Croat-Muslim agreement on cooperation, on the federation and  confederation, was reached under international supervision so as  to restore peace as soon as possible rather than to prolong the  war. Hence, what you have pointed out should be seen from this  point of view -- the international community will try to prevent  the war from spreading. In Bosnia itself there is a threat of  complications on a wider international scale.    [Kuzmanovic] As regards the threat of the war spreading --  does this in a sense cement their [Serb] gains if they can keep  this corridor as a protected zone?    [Tudjman] No, this does not cement the corridor because the  international community will not let the Serbs keep all 70  percent, they [Serbs] even say that they hold as much as 73  percent of Bosnian territory. Things have been made clear --  agreements are being sought on the basis of the agreements  hitherto reached within the Geneva Conference to the effect that  the current Bosniak Muslim-Croat federation should get 51  percent and the Serbs 49 percent. Given the agreement on the  federation and confederation, not only is this waiting in the  wings, but the responsible diplomats taking part in this  conference are saying that the Serbs should pay slightly more  than this for a solution.    Consequently, by no means will the international community  accept such a territorial solution that will correspond with  today's real situation.    [Veric] Luka Veric. Mr. President, it is a fact that many  Croatian citizens are leaving the country. Many of them are  educated young people. A number of ethnic Croats from  Bosnia-Herzegovina are also leaving the country. What is  Croatia doing to stop this? Is there any interest in this?  Some people say that we are talking about worrying numbers of  people leaving. Thank you.    [Tudjman] We could say that we should worry about it, but I  believe that we are not talking about such large numbers.  Croats are leaving for foreign countries, and young people as  well, as a result of the war evils that we have experienced, the  occupation of one quarter of the Croatian territory, and of  everything that the war imposed on us.    Even in normal conditions, insufficiently developed  countries  cannot prevent the so-called brain-drain into the more developed  countries of the world. In Croatian conditions, in such war  conditions, both in Croatia and in Bosnia-Herzegovina, this was  an inevitable consequence.    But at the same time young people are coming back to the  homeland despite the conditions. I have had a report of some  100 young people returning. With the creation of a democratic  Croatia and the economic reforms, with the curbing of inflation  -- we have already begun the positive process, not only of  attracting investment from the diaspora and from foreign  countries, but also of having Croatian people return to the  homeland. We see such cases on a daily basis.    The democratic Croatian authorities must certainly do their  utmost to stimulate this process as much as possible. When the  war ends and the problems are resolved, and agreements are  reached -- like the ones with the United States and the one that  the prime minister signed in Iran and with some other countries  -- through the development of political and economic relations  we will create increasingly favorable conditions to stop our  people leaving and, on the contrary, to have them return to us.    [Unidentified correspondent] The allocation of  socially-owned apartments to high-ranking state officials has  caused a lot of negative reaction. What do you think about this?    [Tudjman] Yes, there are well-justified examples of some  objections raised as regards this, but there is also a lot of  political scheming here, and also -- and many people would not  be aware of this -- a lot of political-psychological warfare  against a sovereign Croatia.    What are we talking about here? We are for a transformation  from the socialist-type social ownership of apartments into  private ownership, so that people have the right to buy  apartments. The right to buy has been given to those who had  tenancy rights [to live in socially-owned apartments] and to  those who could pay [for the apartments] in foreign currency.  In that respect all citizens were in the same position. Those  who were behind the repressive rule over the Croatian people in  the former regime and those who were persecuted by the former  regime because of their democratic and national feelings were in  the same position regarding this.    If there are some irregularities they should be corrected,  equally for everyone. You are probably aware that I personally,  on the rare occasion when I chaired a government session -- I  think in January last year -- chaired a session when the need to  fight all forms of crime mercilessly was the particular focus of  attention. The need to fight the remains of the communist  bureaucratic system and all forms of crime within the new  democratic system was discussed.    But I will tell you that there is a certain lack of  understanding, and attempts by political schemers to discredit  the transformation of the former socialist ownership into  private ownership, and attempts to destabilize the authorities  in this field.    In upcoming days some people will appear before courts who,  between 1990 and the end of 1991, worked in Croatia in an  organized and public way against the founding of a democratic  Croatia and its survival. One of the main aims of their  activities was to compromise the leading people of the new  democratic system. This was a part of their organization's  program, which had the organizational and program name of Opera.    Such activities have resumed, in one way or another, until  today. I can show you on one example how this works in the case  of apartments.    When, after 20 years I got a passport for the first time, so  that I could travel abroad, I met a young man in Canada in 1987  among the people of various party and non-party allegiances in  the Croatian diaspora. I was told he was not interested in  politics but was very competent in the field of electronics and  communications, and that many companies -- from Toronto to  Ottawa and Vancouver -- were headhunting him. I was told he was  the sort of person Croatia needed.    Between 1986 and 1989, that is before the democratic  Croatian  authorities were established, I used to send invitations to  Croatian emigrants, in particular to the young and capable ones,  to return to the homeland. Ivica Mudrinic was among them. He  is the one I just spoke about. Ivica Mudrinic returned to the  country, I do not know how old he (is/was), 35 or 40, with his  four children. He made his knowledge, ability, and his patents  available to democratic Croatia, his homeland. What did the  homeland give him in return? It gave him a tenancy right, the  same right enjoyed by those who had made him and his father  flee, who had imprisoned me and others. So, can we say that  this is an example of crime or dishonesty of the Croatian  ministers?    I am for the remorseless elimination of all forms of crime,  but I am also for giving a real political and ethic name to each  phenomenon [as heard], and for seeing what lies behind some  appearances.    I do not know exactly how many tens of thousands of  apartments we have already sold, and how many there are left to  be sold. This process should be finalized as soon as possible,  so that we can implement the denationalization and  privatization. We will not allow anyone to prevent us from  doing what we want. We have had over one half of the Croatian  population living abroad, some people even say that about the  same number of able-bodied people have left the country as have  stayed in it. There is no democratic Croatia if there is no  possibility for these people to return. There are no democratic  authorities unless the same rights are given to these people as  to those who have stayed in the country. I am not saying that  they should have any preferential treatment, but simply the same  rights. We should make good use of their experience, both  democratic and technical, technological, scientific.    We should stimulate the reconciliation of all citizens of  Croatia, in the interest of [preserving] what we have already  achieved -- an independent, internationally recognized Croatia,  which is not only recognized but also needed by the world for  the creation of a new democratic order in this part of  southeastern Europe. In this light our objective is to have a  legal order of the highest level. What we have written into our  Constitution and laws -- we will be able to fully implement them  when the war is really over, when we return 250,000 people -- I  cannot say to their homes for their homes are destroyed, but to  their ruined hearths. When we reintegrate all these areas into  the constitutional and legal system of Croatia, and when we can  devote ourselves to the economic reconstruction, to the  scientific and cultural progress in Croatia...[pauses] We must  consistently and fully direct all our resources for Croatia to  become a country of freedom and, fully and in every respect, a  country of legal order.    This is something that cannot be secured by any country  that is drawn into war in one way or another. This is something  that is illustrated by the case of the United States during its  war with Japan. It [the U.S.] could not apply, it could not  comply with the civil rights of Japanese citizens. It had to  organize collection centers, camps, and confiscate their  property etc. for national security reasons. There are,  however, those fools who accuse the Croatian authorities of  setting up the camps in Bosnia-Herzegovina, where the Croats did  not set them up first because the Croats had to fight there,  first against the Serb aggression. They had to survive.  Consequently, every phenomenon should be assessed in the light  of the exact circumstances in which the democratic Croatia was  created, defended, and consolidated.    [Janacek] Janacek, [word indistinct] Mr. President, Mr.  Veljko Knezevic, the official representative of the authorities  in Belgrade said in an interview to the HRT [Croatian Radio and  TV] to our colleague Rajic; he used the term Republic of Serb  Krajina as he was talking about Croatia's occupied areas. Can  Croatia tolerate the fact that the official representative of a  country that has not recognized the statehood of that area --  although it itself has not been recognized -- can freely voice  such statements? Or perhaps, he has permission for such  statements?    [Tudjman] I believe that, officially, Croatia cannot  tolerate  such statements. If this representative -- who arrived under  the agreement on the normalization of relations, which implies  the recognition of Croatia within its borders -- were to  continue to air such statements, not only in our country, I  believe, he would have to stop enjoying our hospitality.</p>

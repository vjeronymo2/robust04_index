			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Recognition that south also suffers PARTS of London and coastal towns in the south of England are to receive government aid after 10 years of lobbying by local authorities, MPs and business groups. It is official recognition that although the south-east remains the most prosperous region of the UK pockets of it suffer from decline every bit as severe as that in the worst areas of Wales, Scotland, the north and the Midlands. Towns and areas included in the new regional assistance map - in the first revision by the Department of Trade and Industry since 1984 - have been able to show they have persistent unemployment levels above the national average because of structural rather than cyclical problems. The Isle of Wight has had unemployment rates above the national average for five years. Earlier this year the rate was 13.9 per cent compared with a national figure of 10.7 per cent. This puts it in the worst 5 per cent for unemployment of the 322 travel-to-work-areas in England, Scotland and Wales. Clacton, in Essex, had an unemployment rate of 14.5 per cent last year. Structural unemployment is the prime criterion used by the DTI for inclusion in the map, but the areas have also been able to demonstrate peripherality (poor rail and road communications), demographic imbalances of ageing or young populations, poor future employment prospects, and inner-city decay and deprivation. A common thread, however, among the coastal towns is the long-term decline of their main industry - tourism. Hastings in East Sussex illustrates the point. Before the second world war it was the third largest seaside resort in the country in terms of visitors. It remained popular until the 1960s but the advent of package tours abroad and the end of long-stay family holidays, combined with a failure to invest in new facilities, caused a dramatic decline. Hastings still has many day visitors, but the 'spend' of Pounds 60m is, in relative terms, a fraction of what it was in the 1950s. Attempts were made to offset job losses by attracting service companies and manufacturing. But, hemmed in by the sea on one side and an area of outstanding natural beauty on other flanks, there were few large sites available. Nothing more than branches of big companies were attracted. There have been 1,000 jobs lost in the past five years - from a workforce of less than 70,000. Now the Hastings travel-to-work-area of 157,000 population has persistent unemployment rates above the national average. In July last year when the bid for assisted area status was submitted unemployment was 12.1 per cent against the national average of less than 10 per cent. Mr Roger Carrier, chief executive of Hastings Borough Council, said: 'We want the assisted area status because it means recognition that we do need help. Our economy is too fragile and narrowly based to be self-sustaining. The assisted status could unlock the structural funds from Europe, which means one of our major problems, peripherality, could be addressed.'</p>

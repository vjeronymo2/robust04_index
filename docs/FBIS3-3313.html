The decision came after top national security aides  conferred  to the President for three hours at the White House on how best  to push the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) toward  "a resolution that doesn't end in conflict," the official told  reporters.    The U.S. agreed early this month to suspend the joint  military exercise with South Korea known as "Team Spirit" and to  resume formal talks with the DPRK in Geneva on March 21 after an  international inspections began at the DPRK nuclear sites and  the DPRK and South Korea resumed their dialogue.    But with the collapse of Saturday's [19 March] talks between  the DPRK and South Korea over the issue of nuclear inspections  and the exchange of envoys, the official said, the exercise  "will be rescheduled" and the meeting in Geneva "won't happen"  unless circumstances change over the weekend.    The United States also threatened to proceed with plans to  send Patriot air-defense missiles to South Korea. The United  States will consult with South Korea on timing for deploying the  weapons, the official said.</p>

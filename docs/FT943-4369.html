			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / Minister spells out vision for science Mr David Hunt, science minister, spelled out his 'vision to move science, engineering and technology into the mainstream of our education system, our culture and our public debate' to the British Association yesterday. He emphasised the need for scientists to communicate better and announced grants worth a total of Pounds 375,000 to promote public understanding - Pounds 150,000 for the Royal Society's Committee on the Public Understanding of Science, Pounds 140,000 for the British Association to organise a National Week of Science next year, and Pounds 85,000 for a Science Museum mobile exhibition on 'the information superhighway'. Mr Hunt promised that he would make use of his position as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster - and chairman of several key cabinet economic committees  -'to keep science at the heart of government'. He was cautiously optimistic about the prospects for an increase in the government science budget when next year's public spending plans are announced at the end of November. The prime minister's statement early this year that science would be a high priority for future funding 'is going to be very helpful' in the coming round of public expenditure negotiations, Mr Hunt said.</p>

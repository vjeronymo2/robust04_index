			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Finance and The Family (The Election and You): Labour, who wins and who loses? - Scheherazade Daneshkhu and John Authers meet two ends of the financial scale NIGEL TAPLEY is a director of a renowned City investment bank, where typical annual salaries hover around Pounds 100,000. People on this level of earnings will be hit hard by Labour's tax plans. These include a new tax band of 50 per cent on income greater than Pounds 40,000 and lifting the ceiling on National Insurance contributions, which will effectively add 9 per cent to the marginal rate of tax. Tapley, whose salary is 'comfortably into the proposed new tax band' is not sanguine about the prospect of seeing his marginal rate rise from 40 per cent to 59 per cent (income and NIC) under a Labour government, with the loss of about one third of his present marginal income. 'I'm worried because I think that the very basis on which Labour puts its tax proposals forward is flawed,' says Tapley. 'Taking so much from the top slice and giving it to the lower slice is flawed. For example, I won't be able to do up the house, spend money on carpets and curtains  - this is money which would have gone back into the economy.' Tapley, who lives with his wife in a four-bedroomed flat in Knightsbridge, counts himself lucky that with children aged one and five he is not paying expensive school fees. 'I've got to save to pay for those fees and it will be that much more difficult to save'. But, 'like many of my generation, the last thing I would cut back on is education.' Instead, it is the luxuries that will be affected. The Tapleys have a live-in housekeeper, paid Pounds 500 a month, to look after the children. 'The likelihood is that she would have to go. We don't have a second car or a second home, which is just as well, because they would probably have to go, too.' His wife, who is American, usually spends the summers with the children in the US. They spent last summer in Italy - 'a holiday like that would be out of the question because it is that very slug of disposable income - spent not saved - that would disappear.' His hobbies include golf and shooting. He says he would continue with the golf but would probably give up shooting, which is more expensive. 'I'm not rich. I earn my money and if I didn't have a job, I wouldn't have any money,' says Tapley who, apart from some endowment policies, has little savings. He says he does not mind paying tax at present levels but a Labour government would mean 'you are working for the taxman and not yourself.' He has not needed to look at tax avoidance measures, such as trusts for the children or offshore funds, 'but I will now. It was something I would not consider before but it will be high on the agenda.' His position under a Labour government would still be better than many others. 'Fortunately I'm not a member of Lloyd's - a lot of my friends are going to have a double whammy there.' He believes that the economic policies of a Labour government would fail. 'Any jump out of recession has to mean restoring the confidence of the consumer. Take that away and recovery won't happen.'</p>

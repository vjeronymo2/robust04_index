			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / Clinton rules out summit pact on support for dollar: Murayama calls for policies to pursue stable exchange rates President Bill Clinton effectively ruled out the possibility yesterday that any significant agreement to support the dollar would emerge from this weekend's summit meeting of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations in Naples. Speaking after his first meeting with the new Japanese prime minister, Mr Tomiichi Murayama, Mr Clinton said it would be a mistake for the G7 nations to change the direction of their macroeconomic policy in an effort to halt the fall of the dollar. 'We want the dollar to be properly valued, not undervalued,' Mr Clinton said. 'But I think on the other hand it would be a mistake for us to change the fundamental objective that we all ought to have: the one we agreed to at the G7 last year, which is to pursue global growth.' Mr Clinton's observations unnerved foreign exchange markets, and the dollar fell to its lowest level since April 1993 against the D-Mark. Traders interpreted his comments as showing he was unconcerned about the level of the dollar, and 'soft' on inflation. Meanwhile, the publication of stronger-than-expected US employment figures put pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates. Unemployment held steady at 6.0 per cent in June, against expectations that it would rise to 6.2 per cent. The Clinton-Murayama meeting was one of a series of bilateral talks among leaders before the formal G7 summit, which began last night with a dinner at the 11th-century Castel dell'Ovo in Naples. Heads of government of the US, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada, with the president of the European Commission, will confer today on how to reduce the 35m unemployed in the industrialised world and debate plans to make former Soviet nuclear power stations safer. Tomorrow, they will be joined by President Boris Yeltsin of Russia for discussions on international issues, including Bosnia, North Korea and Rwanda. Yesterday's Clinton-Murayama meeting dispelled some of the fears harboured by the American administration about the policies and stability of the new Japanese socialist-led coalition, and about Mr Murayama's own political leanings. But the good atmosphere generated at the meeting could not disguise the fundamental difference between the US and Japan over the dollar, which, after closing in London at DM1.5741 and Y98.575, fell over a pfennig in New York to trade at DM1.5610. Against the yen it was trading at Y97.88. Commenting on the recent turbulence in foreign exchange markets, Mr Murayama said that countries around the world, 'and especially Japan and the US, should make policy that is conducive to more stable exchange rates in co-operation with each other'. He said the two countries had 'a common understanding' on that, and hoped that 'those responsible for the matter will talk to each other and work at it properly'. Mr Clinton said the relationship of the yen to the dollar was 'obviously a function of the movement of world currency markets'. He said: 'If we continue to pursue growth without inflation and to work on generating new jobs out of that growth, then eventually the macroeconomic realities will assert themselves, and the currencies will be righted according to market conditions.' It was 'important not to overreact'. US welcomes tax plans by Japanese, Page 2 US job statistics, Page 4 Northern cool melts, Page 9 Currencies, Page 13 Lex, Page 24</p>

According to the final communique read after the session,  which lasted several hours, by Gabonese Finance Minister Paul  Toungui, participants "expressed deep concern over the tension  prevailing along the border between the two sisterly republics  of Cameroon and Nigeria."    "They expressed their wish that the current negotiations  will  yield satisfactory results as soon as possible through dialogue  and that a speedy solution will be found so as to preserve peace  and African unity," the communique continued. "Thus, in light  of his experience, they have asked their colleague, President  Omar Bongo of Gabon, to undertake a mediation mission between  the two countries." [passage omitted]</p>

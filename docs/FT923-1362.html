			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Survey of Georgia and Atlanta (7): Style is self-appreciation - Atlanta aims to be one of the top international business centres NOTHING seems quite so essential to Atlanta as 'boosterism'. The Atlanta Chamber of Commerce even claims to have conceived the first ever promotion plan for a US city, back in 1929. Almost every Atlantan boasts of the city's attractions, from its can-do attitude and the low cost of doing business, to its warm southern hospitality and mild climate. And Atlanta's ambitions are hardly humble. 'We want to be considered one of the top five international business centres, alongside London, Paris, Tokyo and New York,' said Mr Jerry Bartels, president of the Atlanta Chamber. 'That's our own self-image and self-expectation.' The city's unabashed self-appreciation is not without a grounding in reality. It has scored the top rankings in business relocation surveys, including Fortune magazine's 1991 survey, 'The Best Cities for Business', and Ernst &amp; Young and the International Association of Corporate Real Estate Executives' 'Reshaping America' study earlier this year. That it is a magnet for corporate relocations is without doubt. It attracted 1,403 new companies between 1983 and last year, according to the Atlanta Chamber of Commerce. Of those, 339 companies were foreign. These relocations have created some 500,000 jobs, giving Atlanta, justifiably, a sense of being a boom town. The city's primary attractions for business include: A pro-business public-private partnership; Excellent transportation, including Atlanta's Hartsfield airport, one of the world's largest and second busiest a rail hub, two deep sea ports and a good highway system; Modern telecommunications, with more fiber optic connections than any other US city; A low corporate tax rate of 6 per cent, charged only on revenues made in the state, and Housing costs are relatively low. 'We are the city of value,' said Ms Judith Webb, spokeswoman for the Atlanta Chamber of Commerce. But concerns exist about the quality of Georgia's workforce. This is underlined by the fact that half of the employment growth since the early 1980s has been imported, non-Georgia labour. The state consequently offers a labour training programme called 'Quick Start,' which will train a workforce specifically to meet a company's needs. It also offers incentives to companies that raise the skill levels of the their employees. And yet, attractions and incentives aside, the boom days appear to be over - at least for now. Since 1990, when the US recession began and the economic pinch began to be felt in Europe and Japan, the pace of investment and relocations has begun to slow. The number of project announcements dropped in 1990 to 260 from 407 in 1989 and to 195 in 1991. KPMG Peat Marwick also found that foreign investment in Georgia, much of which is in the Atlanta area, fell in 1991 for the first time since the company began tracking it in 1984. The cumulative amount invested by foreign firms - firms at least 50 per cent owned by foreign investors - in Georgia dropped to Dollars 7.5bn from Dollars 8.6bn in 1990. Some two thirds of the decline came from 12 companies that were bought by American firms. The survey covered 737 firms, or about 90 per cent of the foreign firms operating throughout Georgia. Yet, while fewer new foreign companies relocated to Georgia last year, nearly half of those surveyed expected to invest further this year, with the total amount to run to Dollars 1.5bn. Atlanta hopes that the award of the 1996 Olympic Games will provide a new burst of interest in the city, particularly from foreign companies. It is particularly keen to attract more corporation and non-profit association headquarters. At present, 13 of the Fortune 500 service companies and nine Fortune 500 industrial companies locate their headquarters here. But, as testimony to its status as the business capital of the south, 422 of the Fortune 500 industrial companies have offices in Atlanta, as do 80 of the 100 largest commercial banking companies. Mr Wayne Gantt, the top economist with Interstate/Johnson Lane, a regional brokerage house, believes that Atlanta is the place to be. 'From Florida to North Carolina, this will be the best market in the United States. Per capita income is rising here more than anywhere in the nation, and there's great infrastructure and immigration of population,' he said. Such is the praise of Atlanta that Mr Bartels says companies coming to look at the city for possible relocation come with high expectations. They are greeted, however, by a phalanx of well versed economic development officials. The Chamber of Commerce, the state's Dept of Industry, Trade and Tourism, the city and, notably, Georgia Power, the state's major electricity supplier, all co-operate in the effort to persuade companies to choose Georgia. Georgia Power even has a video briefing room where visiting executives can call up an impressive amount of information on any site, building or community in the state. Ms Becky Blalock, Georgia Power's manager of facilities relocation, said the energy company has a Dollars 14bn investment in the state that it doesn't want to go to waste. 'We try to do what we can to keep the economy going,' said Ms Blalock. And this seems to be the rule that Atlantans live by.</p>

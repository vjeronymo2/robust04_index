			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi </F> Beilin by Yisra'el Segal and political correspondent Shlomo Raz;  place not given -- live]    [Text] [Segal] Good day, Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi  Beilin, or may I call you minister without portfolio?    [Beilin] Deputy foreign minister is accurate.    [Segal] Our correspondent Shlomo Raz has just reviewed the  difficulties on the Syrian track, which seem to be the result of  the blooming relations with Jordan.    [Beilin] Regrettably, this is not illogical. When we signed  the Oslo agreement, the Syrians panicked a little and felt cast  aside. As a result, they did not advance and even withdrew in  the negotiations. I assume that the Jordanian affair does not  please them very much. They would like to control the process  and set the pace for the Palestinians and the Jordanians, just  as they do in Lebanon. I am very glad that neither the  Palestinians nor the Jordanians are willing to accept the Syrian  pace, which naturally is much more cautious and rigid. I also  hope this will not result in a real setback in the process with  the Syrians, which is extremely important for us and, in fact,  contains the makings of a comprehensive regional agreement.    [Raz] In view of this, was it not a mistake to progress on  the secret tracks with Jordan because, as you said, Syria is the  country that holds the key to a comprehensive agreement in the  region?    [Beilin] Absolutely not. Our policy has always been to make  progress with any neighbor we can: the Palestinians, the  Jordanians, the Syrians, or the Lebanese. We seek to attain as  much as possible with each of the parties -- all the way up to  signing a permanent peace accord -- regardless of the others.  We would be very glad if they all went along with us. We would  be very glad if we could sign peace agreements with all the  parties simultaneously. At the same time, we will allow no one  -- not even the Syrians -- to have the right to veto moves by  another party. As far as we are concerned, we will always take  the risk of someone getting offended or staying behind if we  face the opportunity of signing an agreement or making progress  in that direction with some other party. This is why I am very  happy about what happened with Jordan. I believe we made  important progress. I hope the Syrians will also realize that  comprehensive peace in the region is, first and foremost, to  their advantage.    [Segal] We have just heard that Dennis Ross is now meeting  with Itamar Rabinovich. Do you believe Warren Christopher will  come to Israel?    [Beilin] I cannot tell; neither does my evaluation make much  difference, when we will know the facts in a few hours. I can  say one thing: Whether we like it or not -- and I, for one, am  not happy about it -- there is no way to attain peace with Syria  without the Americans. In order to make peace between us and  the Syrians, they must come here and shuttle between Damascus  and Jerusalem -- not just once, twice, or three times. If they  think it is worth their while to come here only if it is clear  in advance that progress will be made, there will be no  progress. On the other hand, if they come here and work between  the capitals, progress will be made. This is why I very much  hope that they will not make a hasty decision not to come to the  region and that, when they come, they will devote the necessary  time to this issue, because the situation is ripe for making  peace between us and Syria. The broad common denominator  exists. There are gaps, but although they are very wide, the  bridge between them is in sight.</p>

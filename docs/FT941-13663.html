			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / World Trade News: Recycling has neighbours crying foul - Complaints of cheap waste exports to European countries When Germans dutifully put their waste paper into the blue bins on their doorsteps, few could imagine that such environmental-mindedness has resulted in a bitter battle of words with their European neighbours. In 1993, Duales System Deutschland (DSD), the national waste management scheme, collected 4.4m tonnes of used household packaging. Launched in mid-1990, the organisation was set up after parliament adopted a ground-breaking law which imposed collecting and recycling quotas on packaging waste. Within two years DSD had extended its activities to nearly all German households. 'Germans are the master collectors of the world,' Mr Klaus Topfer, federal environment minister and architect of Germany's greenest laws, recently boasted. But the implementation of the ambitious recycling law has raised hackles in Germany and in the European Union. The problem is that DSD has collected more packaging waste than it can recycle in the country. So Germany has had to export large quantities of waste. In 1993 about a third of the 350,000 tonnes of plastic packaging waste collected by DSD was exported to foreign countries. Similar numbers apply to paper and other packaging materials, with the bulk of the exports ending up in France and Britain. Both these countries, in a colourful adaptation of the terminology of international trade conflict, have indignantly accused Germany of dumping subsidised waste materials in their countries, undermining their recycling arrangements. With too much packaging waste in their hands, German recyclers (which are paid by DSD to recycle the collected waste) have in turn offered foreign companies a high price for taking German waste. For example, German recyclers are believed to have paid up to DM600 (Pounds 235) a tonne to a foreign counterpart to get rid of plastic waste. The practice has led to decreasing prices for some packaging waste, especially paper, in other European countries and is hampering the growth of their waste industries. Britain and France, under pressure from their recycling companies, especially those that do not have contracts with German partners, have argued that Germany's ambitious recycling scheme leads to unfair trade practices because it indirectly subsidises waste exports at the expense of private recyclers abroad. 'Germany's waste policies are effectively killing other European recycling schemes which assume that there is a positive price for used packaging,' says Mr Thomas Carter, first secretary for the environment in the British embassy in Bonn. After 18 months of wrangling between members countries and lobbying by the packaging industry, the other European environment ministers outvoted Germany, the Netherlands and Denmark last December on an EU directive on packaging waste. The directive requires that, within five years, a minimum of 25 per cent of packaging waste, and a maximum of 40 per cent, should be recycled. Within 10 years environment ministers would have to agree to 'substantial increases' in these percentages. The directive amounts to a slap in the face for Germany, whose own recycling quotas are higher than those it lays down. Germany already recycles 66 per cent of its used paper, 55 per cent of glass containers, and 48 per cent of tin cans. Moreover, Germany's recycling law will increase these targets to 70 per cent for these three types of packagings from January 1 1996. However, according to the directive, Germany, the Netherlands and Denmark, which also have ambitious recycling targets, will be able to continue meeting their high quotas. But they will have to prove that they have domestic recycling capacity for any amount collected above the EU limits. Mr Topfer says he will fight to amend the directive when it goes before the European Parliament. The German Environment Ministry argues that the EU directive on packaging waste violates the free trade spirit of the EU. It adds that, if the directive was adopted, Germany would bring the matter to court, arguing that the EU treaty allows exceptions for member states in matters relating to the environment. 'Our legal experts are studying the issue right now. Secondary raw material should be traded freely in the European Union and no limits can legally be imposed on such trade,' explains Mr Thomas Rummler, adviser at the Bonn Environment Ministry. Bonn says the issue has been exploited by French and British waste management companies that do not have contracts with DSD and therefore have not received money to take German waste. The ministry says British companies exported 68,673 tonnes of used paper to Germany in 1992 - nearly three times more than German companies exported to Britain. According to officials at the French embassy, the directive has sparked protests from waste management companies that would lose their contracts with DSD. 'Those who were winning before are now crying out,' says an official. But the directive should allow for a harmonisation of waste recycling schemes in other European countries so that distortions can be ironed out. Most other European countries have adopted recycling schemes similar to Germany's (such as the eco-emballage system in France) but which are effective on much smaller scales. In the long term, however, expanding recycling schemes will have to confront the problem of falling prices for waste packaging and falling profits for recyclers.</p>

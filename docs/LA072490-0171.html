			<p><P> July 24, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ABC'S 'CHINA BEACH' JUGGLES DECADES  </P> <P> ABC's "China Beach" will move not only to a new time next season. In some  episodes, it will travel to new decades, its producer says.  </P> <P> The Vietnam War series goes to Saturdays at 9 p.m. in the fall and, in the  season pilot, jumps forward to the year 1985, executive producer John Sacret  Young said Monday.  </P> <P> The acclaimed drama that chronicles nurses and doctors attending to war has  been set in the 1960s since its debut two years ago.  </P> <P> This fall, the series also will follow the main characters' lives in sequences  that occur in the 1970s and 1980s, Young said.  </P> <P> "The characters are going to have a wild ride," Young said.  </P> <P> "China Beach," despite laudatory reviews and an Emmy award last year for star  Dana Delany, had a wild ride itself this season.  </P> <P> Never a ratings winner, the dark depiction of life in the trenches faced an  uncertain fate until ABC renewed it for the fall at the last minute.  </P> <P> Network entertainment President Bob Iger said he hopes the show's new time  slot, which will precede ABC's cult hit "Twin Peaks," helps to ensure its  survival.  </P> <P> Young and Delany, speaking to television critics Monday, said they were  surprised the visceral series has lasted this long.  </P> <P> "China Beach" premiered as a spring replacement series in 1988. "I didn't think  the pilot would get picked up," Delany said.  </P> <P> Next season, Delany's character, the hard-drinking, emotionally stifled nurse  Colleen McMurphy, will be shown as an oft-married woman in flash-forward  sequences, Young said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 2, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> Oklahoma running back Mike Gaddis has not recovered from a knee injury that cut  his season in half last year and will miss the entire 1990 football season,  Coach Gary Gibbs said.  </P> <P> "Based on my observation and some conversation with the doctor and Mike, I  don't feel he will be ready to participate at all this coming season," Gibbs  said. "He's not nearly where he needs to be. He has a long way to go."  </P> <P> Gaddis, a junior from Midwest City, will have one year of college eligibility  remaining because he used 1987 as a redshirt year.  </P> <P> Gaddis was the nation's second-leading rusher last season through six games  with 829 yards when he injured his knee against Texas.  </P></p>

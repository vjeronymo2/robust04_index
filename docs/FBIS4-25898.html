			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 16 (AFP) -- China rejected Thursday a  U.S. draft resolution calling for UN sanctions against North  Korea over the nuclear issue, saying it was still not too late  to return to the negotiating table. "China in principle doesn't  subscribe to the involvement of the Security Council in the  nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula or resorting to sanctions  to solving it," foreign ministry spokesman Shen Guofang told  journalists when asked for China's view of the draft. "China  believes that the only way to a proper solution is direct  dialogue held between the parties concerned," Shen told a weekly  news briefing, urging all sides to make every effort to ensure a  return to talks rather than resorting to action that could lead  to confrontation. "We believe there is still room and the  possiblity for a proper solution to this issue," Shen said.    The United States presented UN Security Council members  Wednesday with the draft of a resolution calling for phased  sanctions against North Korea after it this week pulled out of  the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). China, which has  veto power as a permanent member of the Security Council, has  consistently opposed calls for the imposition of sanctions  against its communist ally.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Talks between Israel and the Palestinians in Cairo  are making appreciable headway. From Cairo this report by our  correspondent to the talks, 'Umar Zaydani:    [Begin recording] [Zaydani] The Civilian Committee concluded  its work, and an agreement is now being drafted before it is  presented to Amnon Shahaq and Nabil Sha'th for ratification. A  short while ago, Dr. Sha'th spoke to us:    [Sha'th] The Civilian Committee yesterday worked late into  the night, until 0300, and completed all its work. However, the  papers on which initital agreement was reached have to be  ratified by me and General Shahaq, who is in Israel and is  expected back at 1200. The two sides may be able to finalize  agreement on the transfer of all civilian powers this afternoon,  after they introduce the necessary amendments. The Legal  Committee is moving very slowly, with the jurisdiction  [al-Wilayah] problem being the main sticking point. As for the  Civilian Committee, it registered some progress this morning. I  think it should be possbile for us to deal with some papers that  have been pending since the past week, and thus move to finalize  subjects on which agreement is possible, in the hope of  addressing the tougher issues, like the jurisdiction.    [Zaydani] Nabil Sha'th says the Civilian Committee is  addressing some details, including the entry of the Palestinian  police force, the withdrawal of the Israeli Defense Force, and  the crossings between Israel and Gaza and Jericho.    [Sha'th] Some of the papers have failed to address certain  details, like the entry of the Palestinian police and the  Israeli withdrawal, road zoning, and the crossings between  Israel and Gaza. I think these points may be finalized this  evening.    [Zaydani] On the water issue, Dr. Sha'th said the  Palestinians will have exclusive control of water in Gaza and  Jericho. Water for the settlements will be brought over from  Israel, Nabil Sha'th says.    [Sha'th] The water in Gaza and Jericho will be fully under  Palestinian control. The drilling of new wells and maintenance  of existing wells will also fall under the authority of the  Palestinians. Israel will continue to bring water from Israel  to the settlements and also to Gaza; we will be charged only the  cost of the water that we will get from Israel. The water bound  for the settlements will transit land under our sovereignty.  The Israeli (Makarot) company will continue to supply the  settlements with water. The settlement consumption of water  will not exceed the present ceiling. These are the fundamental  points. The details will be announced when we sign the paper.    [Zaydani] Thus water and its control -- one of the stubborn  problems that have blocked the path of the negotiations over the  past few days -- is now out of the way. There remain problems  to be worked out by the Legal Committee, like the legal  jurisdiction in the self-rule areas. The Legal Committee is  making progress. The Security Committee's two subcommittees  will draw up a timetable for the release of Palestinian  detainees. [end recording]</p>

			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / Commercial property investment market levels out The commercial property investment market has levelled out after its steep rise over the past year, Vanessa Houlder writes. The total return from the property investment market in May was 29 per cent, down on April's 29.3 per cent, according to the monthly index by Richard Ellis, chartered surveyors. The decline in the bond market has taken its toll on property, with the result that capital growth is no longer being driven by declining investment yields - the ratio of income to capital. Rental growth, which would boost values, has not yet appeared. Rents fell in May, after stabilising in previous months. In the office sector, rents edged down slightly after three months of no rental changes. The value of offices has fallen slightly for the second successive month. In the retail sector, rents fell 0.4 per cent in May, in contrast to April when the sector recorded its first rental growth for three years. In the industrial sector, rents also fell by 0.4 per cent after being static in April.</p>

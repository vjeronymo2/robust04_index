			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Corporate Disclosure Annual meetings have become more exciting in the wake of the stock exchange's guidelines on corporate disclosure. More companies are using the occasion to make significant statements on trading, just as the guidelines require. The market, however, is not quite sure what to make of it all. Both Ladbroke and Inchcape fell sharply on annual meeting statements that some saw as profit warnings. The new approach is bound to make share prices more volatile than one in which information is allowed to seep gradually into the market. But that is a price worth paying for a fuller disclosure policy. Besides, the market has yet to learn to expect such statements and get them in perspective. This seems to have been a particular problem in the case of Inchcape, which thought it was simply confirming something the market already knew - that this year's first half would not look good against the same period of 1993 when the yen was lower. Ladbroke at least divulged something new about the weakness of its credit betting business. But in neither case was the statement easy to evaluate. The provision of some extra information inevitably leads to a demand for more. Much though companies shy away from the effort involved, it looks increasingly as though quarterly statements may be the answer. Investors would have some numbers to go on, which would not need to be audited, instead of just the chairman's annual meeting text. Moreover, a quarterly statement would be regarded as routine. If disappointments emerged, it would not necessarily be dubbed with the title of profits warning.</p>

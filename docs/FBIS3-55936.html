It happened straight after the abolition of  Article 6 in the Constitution of the day -- one that stipulated  the CPSU's monopoly on power.    Today's issue of LITERATURNAYA GAZETA [LITERARY GAZETTE, a  Moscow-based weekly] reports that Anatoliy Sobchak made this  announcement during a ceremony at which he was presenting his  new book, The Tbilisi Fracture, or Bloody Sunday 1989.    A multiparty system is in the offing, so we must act before  the event, words to that effect were, according to the mayor,  said by Mikhail Gorbachev at a Politburo sitting at the time.  We ourselves ought to set up the first alternative party, but  one that would be malleable.    The selection of a prospective party leader was left to the  then-KGB, Sobchak says. As always, it rose to the task; it  found among its so-called active reserve a man with the military  rank of captain, whose name is now widely known. The name of  the party, Liberal Democratic, was also invented there and then.  It was a real success: After all, the word liberal has long  been compromised in this country. Two weeks later the new party  was officially registered. It was the first registered  political party in the country, since the CPSU had never  undergone the procedure; the party of Russian Communists was not  registered until much later and under a slightly different name.    This story, the St. Petersburg mayor said, will be told in  his next book, which is to be entitled: Once Upon a Time  There Was a Communist Party.</p>

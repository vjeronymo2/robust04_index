			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Paris, Feb 16 (AFP) -- French Prime Minister Edouard  Balladur suffered a new fall in his popularity in an opinion  poll to be published Thursday [17 February], but he was still at  record levels after more than 10 months in power.    Balladur dropped five points to 55 percent in a poll by the  BVA institute carried out for the weekly Paris-Match while those  dissatisfied with him increased by seven points to 36 percent.    Two polls published a week ago showed a similar trend, with  Gallup registering a seven percent drop to 52 percent and CSA a  six-point drop to 56 percent as Balladur, an undeclared  candidate in 1995 presidential elections, battled with sometimes  violent protest movements.    Since last October, the prime minister has given way to the  protesters, capitulating first to Air France strikers by  withdrawing a draconian restructuring plan for the loss-making  airline.    In January, a massive demonstration by more than 600,000  teachers and students against a reform plan forced its  abandonment and last month, the government gave way to violent  protests by French fishermen protesting cheap imports.    The BVA poll said 62 percent would support a broad protest  movement of demonstrations or a general strike, compared with 56  percent a month ago, in face of Balladur's attempts to reduce  unemployment and fight recession, criticised by some sections of  his own right-wing coalition as too timid.    The BVA poll also said there was an increase of two points  to  74 percent of people thinking there was a risk of an upheaval  comparable to the student uprising and general strike of May  1968.    The poll also said 21 percent, compared with 17 percent,  would take an active part in such an upheaval, while another 41  percent would support it, compared with 39 percent a month ago.    Six percent, a one point drop, would oppose it and 25  percent  (unchanged) would remain neutral.</p>

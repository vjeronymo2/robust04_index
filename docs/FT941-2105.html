			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Survey of Jersey (10): Mixed fortunes across the industry - As far as arable crops are concerned, the past three years have been average at best and disastrous at worst / Agriculture Historically, agriculture has been Jersey's most important industry but over the past 50 years it has been eclipsed by the rise of the tourism and finance sectors. About 55 per cent of the island's land is given over to agriculture, but it contributed only 4 per cent of the income for 1992, compared to 50 per cent generated by the financial sector. However, the countryside has been a big factor in Jersey's success as a tourist resort and it is in the island's best interest to maintain agriculture as a viable industry. But over the past three years the value of agriculture, excluding the dairy industry, has fallen from Pounds 40m to just over Pounds 30m. Many young growers are leaving the industry and if this year is unsuccessful the remaining growers will face a crisis. On the other hand, the dairy side of the industry is looking remarkably healthy. Jersey's famous cows produce milk with a rich cream content and even though demand for full-fat milk has dropped, sales have continued to increase and are now worth more than Pounds 10m a year. This goes against the trend as milk sales in most European Union countries are dropping steadily. Since 1954, the Jersey Milk Marketing Board has been obliged to take all the milk produced in the island. The limited local market for dairy products and the increasing demand for low-fat products has made it difficult for the board to sell all that it receives. A recent development has been a move into the portion control market, which has been extremely successful since 1988. Jersey milk pots are now being used by British Airways, Dairy Crest, the milk processing and supply subsidiary of the Milk Marketing Board in England, and Butlins holiday camps. The JMMB is also negotiating with MacDonald's, the hamburger chain. The dairy is due to buy an extra Pounds 1.5m packing machine within the next year to cope with demand and bring production up to 250,000 units a year. Despite this success, the JMMB still receives a subsidy of Pounds 1m from Jersey's government, the States, each year. As far as arable crops are concerned, the past three years have been average at best and disastrous at worst. The main crop, the Jersey Royal potato, accounts for roughly half the annual crop returns. Since 1990, when the crop was worth more than Pounds 20m, returns have dropped by almost 25 per cent. This is not purely due to competition from Cyprus and the Canary islands - the recession and a fair amount of infighting between the four local marketing groups has also damaged the industry by depressing prices. Almost all crops are exported to the UK and most of these go to the main supermarket chains. The amount of profit made in a season is still largely down to luck, with the weather being the all-important factor. Diversification has taken place in several areas. Iceberg lettuce is now being successfully grown in the island and is bought by a number of the national supermarket chains in the UK. Indoor tomatoes, once the exclusive province of Guernsey, are now being grown with far more success in Jersey. Other crops, such as aubergines, are being investigated, but to be of use to the industry they have to be grown in a quantity that would be of interest to a supermarket chain. Different varieties of existing crops, such as lettuce, cauliflower and flowers, are constantly being investigated by the local States' farm, which has pledged Pounds 250,000 specifically for this research. Marketing groups are carrying out their own work but as yet nothing new is being grown in significant quantities. The trend of the past few years indicates that farmers are returning to the Jersey Royal as the crop most likely to give them a good return on their investment. While it faces the greatest competition from overseas it remains a unique product with recognisable brand name. The realisation that it is a quality crop which can command a high price has led to greater care being taken during harvesting. As a direct result of the recession, Jersey's Department of Agriculture and Fisheries has decided to direct the Pounds 7.6m of aid it gives out in 1994 to those who can demonstrate that they are in need.</p>

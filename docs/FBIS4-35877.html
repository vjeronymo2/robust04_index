			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres returned home from  Morocco Friday [3 June] and said Israel insists that the  Palestinian self-rule would be in Jericho and not in Jerusalem.    [Begin Peres recording] I did not send any letter to Yasir  'Arafat. I sent a letter to the Norwegian foreign minister in  response to his letter to me. My letter was not even addressed  top secret and contained my remarks to the Knesset. The reason  for my action was our insistence that the Palestinian civilian  authority be based in Jericho and not in Jerusalem. I said we  do not want to harm the spiritual, cultural, medical  institutions in Jerusalem, but that the authority would deal  only with Jericho. I would like to remind you that the  negotiations almost blew up over the Jericho issue because of  our insistence that the autonomy's center would be in Jericho.  [end recording]</p>

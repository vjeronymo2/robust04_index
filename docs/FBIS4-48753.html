			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] In Togo, the prime minister appointed by  President Eyadema a month ago, Edem Kodjo, has finally formed  his government, which was announced yesterday. There are 18  ministers and one secretary of state. Mr. Kodjo himself  presents the ministerial team and its program:    [Begin Kodjo recording] I assure the Togolese people as a  whole of my desire to place the government's action in the  framework of the joint program of the parliamentary majority,  but in a spirit of openness, with its hand outstretched to all.  For we must avoid any sectarianism, as we put ourselves  resolutely at the service of the Togolese people as a whole.    I appeal to the union of all democratic forces, and to all  people of goodwill, so that we may consolidate our efforts to  respond to the profound desire for change expressed by all the  people of Togo.    This government is perhaps not the government we should have  liked to have formed, but the expectations and the sufferings of  the people forced its composition on us. It must get down to  work, while at the same time trying to preserve the future.  [end recording] [passage omitted]</p>

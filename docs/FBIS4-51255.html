			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Central People's Broadcasting Station reporter Liu </F> Zhenying (0491 2182 5391) and XINHUA reporter He Ping (0149  1627)]    [Text] Beijing, 25 May (XINHUA) -- The State Council  called a teleconference at Zhongnanhai this afternoon to make  arrangements for the work of "preventing fraud, theft, and  robbery; and safeguarding funds security in banks" ["three  preventions and one safeguard"]. Zhu Rongji, vice premier of  the State Council and governor of the People's Bank of China  [PBOC], attended and addressed the meeting.    It has been learned that some criminals have made banks  their  targets for wantonly carrying out all kinds of financial crimes  since reform and opening up to the outside world, particularly  during recent years when China accelerated the development of a  socialist market economy. Under the leadership of the party  Central Committee and the State Council and the strong support  of the public security, procuratorial, and judicial departments,  banks and finance companies at various levels in the banking  system have persistently cracked down on economic crimes;  carried out first the activities of "education, cleanup, and  rectification" and then the work of "two preventions and one  safeguard" -- which was mainly for "preventing fraud and theft,  and safeguarding the security of funds in banks" -- and scoring  some successes since the latter half of 1991.    Zhu Rongji said: At present, criminal activities, such as  financial fraud, have become a noticeable problem for the  banking system. Cadres, staff, and workers of banking  departments at all levels must conscientiously enhance their  sense of responsibility for protecting state property and  safeguarding state interests; strictly implement the state's  banking laws, regulations, and rules; and try hard to improve  their political and professional caliber, to make due efforts to  guarantee a normal banking order for the state.    In his speech, Zhu Rongji also stated his views on the  current macroeconomic situation and the tasks facing the  country's banking system.    Luo Gan, state councillor and secretary general of the State  Council, presided over the teleconference. PBOC Vice Governor  Zhou Zhengqing and Public Security Vice Minister Mou Xinsheng  addressed the meeting, expressing specific views on resolutely  preventing and cracking down on the crimes of financial fraud,  theft, and robbery, and safeguarding funds security in banks.    Zhou Zhengqing pointed out: All in all, China's current  economic and banking situation is good, with the banking  situation continuing its smooth and healthy development, the  banking order improving further, and the banking reform  advancing steadily. In the course of progress, however, there  remain some problems that deserve our attention. Among them,  the crimes of financial fraud, theft, and robbery are a  noticeable problem most seriously disturbing, damaging, and  affecting current financial undertakings, financial reform, and  opening up of the financial sector to the outside world. They  not only brought to the state tremendous economic risks and  losses and endangered the personal safety of bank staff and  workers, but also disturbed normal social and banking order,  seriously damaged financial institutions' reputation, and posed  a serious threat to banking undertakings and even economic  development. They will seriously compromise the smooth progress  of our reform, opening up to the outside world, and economic  construction, should we fail to take resolute, effective  measures to stop and prevent their occurrence. Leading comrades  at all levels in the banking system must have a clear  understanding of this. All banks and finance companies should  immediately mobilize all their personnel to act swiftly and  struggle resolutely against the various financial crimes.    Zhou Zhengqing stressed: To resolutely stop and prevent  financial fraud, theft, and robbery, we need to take the  following measures: 1) All banks and finance companies at all  levels in the banking system must attach great importance to the  work of "preventing fraud, theft, and robbery; and safeguarding  funds security in banks." It is particularly important for  principal leading comrades of banks and finance companies at all  levels to place the work high on the agenda and carry it out as  an important matter. 2) To resolutely expose and crack down on  fraud under the cover of "foreign capital introduction," the  utilization of foreign capital must be examined and approved in  strict accordance with relevant state provisions and procedures.  3) It is essential to strictly observe banking laws and  regulations and resolutely implement various rules and  regulations. Banks and other financial institutions at all  levels should do business in strict accordance with the  stipulated terms of reference and within the approved scope of  operation. 4) We should strengthen case investigation and  handling to enforce banking discipline. 5) Efforts should be  made to strengthen education and training for the vast  contingent of cadres, staff, and workers on the "three  preventions and one safeguard."    Zhou Zhengqing said: After this teleconference, all units  should promptly relay to all cadres, staff, and workers the  conference guidelines and speeches of the leading comrades of  the party Central Committee and the State Council, earnestly  organize discussions, scrutinize loopholes and problems, and  draw up realistic and feasible preventive measures. The head  offices of banks and finance companies should arrange for the  work of "three preventions and one safeguard" throughout their  entire organizations; forward clear and specific demands; and  conscientiously strengthen supervision, inspection, and guidance  to prevent and stop financial fraud, theft, and robbery.    Mou Xinsheng demanded that public security organs at all  levels earnestly implement this conference's guidelines and --  under the leadership of local party committees and governments  -- support and work closely with banking institutions in  vigorously preventing and cracking down on fraud, theft, and  robbery in banks and in safeguarding fund security in banks.  Once they receive a report on bank theft or robbery, as well as  forgery, theft, or illegal sale of value-added tax receipts, the  public security organs should assemble competent officers and  men to take swift action and decisive measures to contain and  intercept the criminals and to try every possible means to take  control of the illicit money to avoid or minimize losses. They  should resolutely and completely destroy the lairs for forging  or illegally selling value-added tax receipts to effectively  safeguard the smooth implementation of tax reforms.    Also attending the meeting were responsible people from  relevant departments under the State Council, financial  institutions, the Supreme People's Court, and the Supreme  People's Procuratorate; and other departments concerned.    Comrades in charge of banking work from people's governments  at and above the county level as well as responsible comrades of  financial and public security departments at various levels took  part in the teleconference at more than 2,000 different  locations.</p>

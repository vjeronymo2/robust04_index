			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Mike Bempong] </F>   [Text] Relations between Ghana and Togo over the last  couple of years have been anything but cordial and friendly.  They have been characterized by border clashes, border  incursions, mutual suspicions, Togolese accusations of  subversion, Ghanaian denials of such accusations, refugee  problems, maltreatment of Ghanaians in Togo, and so on and so  forth. These issues have dominated and poisoned the  relationship between the two neighboring countries to the extent  that people on either side of the border have begun to see them  as normal. But for two countries which share such deep  historical, ethnic, and economic ties there is hardly anything  normal about this state of affairs.    It is indeed shameful that the great potential that exists  for subregional cooperation and collaboration for the mutual  benefit of the peoples of the two countries is being allowed to  go to waste. To be fair, however, it must be said that the Ghana  Government over the years has taken one initiative after the  other with the view to achieving the reversal of the present  status quo. These initiatives, including the setting up of a  Joint Ghana-Togo Border Demarcation Commission [and] the  conclusion of the quadripartite agreements, have not been  appreciated by the Togolese authorities. Rather, they eventually  subverted them in one way or the other. Year after year, the  Togolese authorities continue to blame Ghana for all their  internal problems and woes. The latest in the seemingly  unending string of Togolese accusations against Ghana were  actually accompanied by unacceptable levels of aggression  against Ghanaians and Ghanaian property. It may never be known  how many innocent Ghanaian lives were lost through this  unprovoked aggression by the Togolese security agencies. But,  certainly, no responsible government can continue to look on  unconcerned as its national and property are subjected to  unprovoked aggression.    It is in this light that last Friday's [21 January] news  conference has been welcomed by Ghanaians even though some  consider that the time for action is long overdue. The Togolese  authorities need to take the foreign minister's advice seriously  that any new unprovoked aggression will be met with commensurate  response. Ghanaians, it appears, are being taken for granted by  our neighbors simply because we are peaceful and peace-loving  and we want to concentrate our time and energies on the  development of our motherland. This should not however be  misconstrued to mean we lack the capacity for self-defense or  our government is incapable of protecting its nationals and  their property. Let the Togolese authorities be advised to  settle down to constructively resolving their own internal  conflicts through democratic means rather than looking for  enemies where none exist.</p>

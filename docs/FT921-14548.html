			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / Unions accused of 'humbug and hypocrisy' UNIONS are often guilty of 'humbug and hypocrisy' over single-union deals, according to Mr Alex Ferry, general secretary of the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions, David Goodhart writes. He said some of the most aggressive critics of single-union deals were those which had lost out in 'beauty contests' for single-union deals. 'If you don't agree with the system, you should not participate', he said. Mr Ferry said at a conference of the Involvement and Participation Association, that unions must accept single-union deals or no recognition at all. At the same conference, Mr Tony Blair, shadow employment secretary, said that there would be no repeal of existing trade union legislation under a Labour government. 'Like companies, unions will be subject to proper legal regulation,' he said. 'Like companies, they will be entitled to fairness within the law, not favours outside it. But there can be no group of people outside of the cabinet that truly believe that the future of Britain in the 1990s will seriously be decided by re-running the debates of the 1970s.'</p>

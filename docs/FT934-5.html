			<p>931231 FT  31 DEC 93 / International Company News: P&amp;G agrees Argentine acquisition Procter &amp; Gamble, the US consumer products group, said yesterday it had reached an agreement to buy Compania Quimica, an Argentine manufacturer of liquid dish-washing detergents, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The terms of the deal were not disclosed by Procter or Bunge y Born SA, Quimica's Buenos Aires-based parent company. Procter said the acquisition of Quimica, which sells a variety of consumer products in Argentina, including the country's top two dishwashing detergents, was part of a strategy to expand into Latin America through the purchase of established brands. The US group began operations in Argentina in 1991, and currently sells a range of locally-produced and imported consumer goods.</p>

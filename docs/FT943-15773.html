			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / International Company News: Mazda seeks 10% reduction in costs Mazda, the loss-making Japanese carmaker, plans to cut manufacturing costs by 10 per cent this year, and reduce over the medium term the number of models it makes. The group, which in 1993 incurred its first loss in 19 years, would be in the red again this year, said Mr Henry Wallace, a former Ford executive recently appointed vice-president of Mazda, which is a 24.5 per cent-owned Ford affiliate. However, he forecast Mazda would return to profit in the following 12 months. Mr Wallace is one of the three senior Ford executives who joined Mazda early this year - through an agreement between the companies - to expand their 25-year-old partnership and help Mazda adjust to the slowdown in its main markets. Since the start of the year, Mazda has nearly doubled the size of its design engineering team. It seeks cost-savings through the redesign of components, and has also secured 10 per cent price cuts from component suppliers. This is on top of earlier restructuring plans which involved closing a plant and and reducing the workforce by 3,000, 10 per cent of the total, during the three years to 1996. The group was also planning to rationalise its product line, where it had 'too many products we can't support for the future', said Mr Wallace. However, Mazda's production capacity was now 'pretty much OK', he said. The group could break even by next year, even if the Japanese currency rose to Y95 to the dollar, and make a 'significant profit' at Y100 to the dollar, he said. Mazda had prepared 'contingency plans' to become profitable if the rate rose above Y95. Mr Wallace hoped that talks with Ford on possible European co-operation would be finalised in the next 12 months. The next step in the alliance has been the subject of renewed speculation since Ford's decision in April to create worldwide divisions for different classes of car.</p>

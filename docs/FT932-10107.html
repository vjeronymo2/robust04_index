			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Backbench revolt looms over VAT MINISTERS WERE last night trying to curb the extent of an embarrassing revolt over the government's plans to extend value added tax to domestic fuel, as the Finance Bill implementing the Budget began its Commons committee stage. Mr Michael Portillo, chief Treasury secretary, was forced to run a gauntlet of backbench dissent in the wake of last week's morale-sapping election results for the government. Mr William Powell, the Tory MP for Corby, was the first backbencher to pledge open defiance after a string of worried and sceptical Conservative interventions during Mr Portillo's speech. A common thread in their misgivings was the impact of the government's plans on those with pensions and savings marginally above the level entitling them to support from the social security system. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, announced in the Budget that he planned to extend VAT to domestic fuel from next April. In a measured but determined tone, Mr Powell said he would vote against the government 'with enthusiasm', adding: 'I know my constituents would feel ashamed of me if I were to vote for it tonight.' He accused Mr Lamont of making a 'very serious error of judgment' in extending VAT into an area never previously contemplated by the Commons. He said it was this extension of VAT that had encouraged traditional Conservative voters in Northamptonshire to stay at home in last week's county council elections. Mrs Angela Browning, the Tory MP for Tiverton, expressed similar sentiments and said that voters in the south-west were already having to find the money to pay sharply increased water charges. Mr Terry Dicks, Tory MP for Hayes and Harlington, attacked the government for 'punishing pensioners' while subsidising the arts and contributing significant sums to overseas aid. Mr Portillo took pains to emphasise both the urgency of the need to tackle the public sector borrowing requirement and the full extent of the benefits which pensioners and those on income support had derived from other government policies. 'It may be that the increases the government has made in help to the poorest people have been so numerous and so large that the House is out of touch with where we have now reached,' he said. Details of the measures the government proposed to help those worst-hit by the VAT extension would be set out in the autumn uprating statement. But he said it would be 'unrealistic to give extra help to all pensioners over and above the retail prices index effect', because 'we could be talking about another Pounds 1bn on benefit'. For Labour, Ms Harriet Harman, shadow chief Treasury secretary, urged Tory backbenchers to join the opposition in voting against the government, saying it was the backbenchers' chance to show that 'even if the government cannot listen' to the electorate 'perhaps they can'. She said the government's proposals would make 'some of the poorest and most vulnerable pay the price for the government's economic incompetence'. She added: 'This VAT ex-tension paves the way for further VAT extensions to children's clothes, newspapers and food.'</p>

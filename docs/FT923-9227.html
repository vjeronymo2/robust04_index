			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report London COCOA prices closed easier, but above the key support area of Pounds 662 a tonne for the December contract. 'The market's done exactly what we wanted - slipped back a bit and then consolidated in steady volume. Everything looks set for another go on the upside,' one trader said. In New York cocoa futures were narrowly mixed by midday. 'The market is digesting its recent gains. The weather continues to be dry in the Ivory coast and the market should maintain a steady tone,' a New York trader said. On the LME Chinese buying interest helped COPPER, NICKEL and ALUMINIUM. The copper market showed a marked reluctance to fall, with recent declines meeting good support between Dollars 2,480 and Dollars 2,490 a tonne for three-month metal. The Polish copper miners' strike is also a background factor, dealers said. Aluminium softened in the afternoon on liquidation after August option declarations, although reports of Chinese buying interest cushioned the decline, dealers said. New York COTTON futures were lower at midday, with Japan continuing to stay out of the US export market. Traders continue to be concerned about the Delta crop, hit by insect infestation.</p>

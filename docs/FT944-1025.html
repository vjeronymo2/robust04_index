			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Jupiter Tyndall in early stage of takeover talks Jupiter Tyndall, the fund management group, said yesterday that was in talks with unnamed parties about its possible acquisition. In a statement following the close of trading, Jupiter's board noted the recent rise in its share price and speculation about the company's future, and issued the statement as a result. Yesterday, the shares rose 7p to close at 402p, compared with about 300p in mid-September. The company said discussions were being held 'with a small number of parties'. Talks were at an early stage and there was no indication that an offer would be made at a premium to the share's present level. Speculation has centred on a continental financial institution, possibly a German insurer. It is likely that in agreeing to any offer, Jupiter would seek a buyer which offered business possibilities, such as access to a continental distribution network for its retail financial products. Jupiter made the announcement after consultation with its advisers and discussion with the Takeover Panel. About 40 per cent of Jupiter's shares are held by management or individuals associated with them. Last summer, Jupiter sold its banking division to Cater Allen, the money broker, and said it intended to concentrate on expanding its fund management business. It acquired Queen Anne's Gate Asset Management last September, a move which expanded its assets under management to Pounds 4.15bn. In the six months to September 30, the company also increased its assets by Pounds 350m in net new cash from clients.</p>

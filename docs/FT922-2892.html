			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / Thai PM calls in former colleagues for cabinet MR Anand Panyarachun, Thailand's interim prime minister, yesterday unveiled a new cabinet, whose main aims will be to restore confidence in the economy after last month's killings of pro-democracy demonstrators and to prepare for new elections within four months. Most of the 26 cabinet members served in Mr Anand's previous government between the military coup d'etat in February 1991 and the elections in March this year, although the prime minister was unable to persuade Mr Suthee Singhasaneh, his choice for the finance portfolio, to take the job. 'Mr Suthee has been in the job for different governments over the past 10 years and he is over 60,' Mr Anand said. The new finance minister is Mr Panas Simasathien, 59, a US-educated career civil servant who was permanent secretary in the same ministry. For the sensitive post of interior minister - the official charged with organising the new election in a country noted for its corrupt electoral practices - Mr Anand chose police General Pow Sarasin. He is a member of one of Thailand's most influential families and at one time was in charge of the fight against drugs. His brother Arsa Sarasin returns as foreign minister. Mr Anand was named prime minister by King Bhumipol in a surprise edict last week to replace the unpopular Gen Suchinda Kraprayoon, who was forced to resign after the violence last month. The new premier chose Gen Banchob Bunnag, an uncontroversial retired army chief of staff, as his defence minister. 'He had a good record in the army, with no doubtful past, politically or militarily,' said Mr Anand. 'No involvement in any violent crackdowns, either the recent or earlier ones.' Foreign investors and the local business community praised the liberalising economic reforms carried out by the previous Anand administration, and they are likely to welcome the familiar faces in his cabinet after the turmoil of the last two months. The ministers of commerce, industry, transport and communications and agriculture are the same as before. Thais will now have to wait anxiously to see whether the humiliated military leaders continue to keep a low profile, and whether the elections will produce a government which is both acceptable to the demonstrators who defeated Gen Suchinda and economically competent.</p>

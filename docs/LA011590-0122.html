			<p><P> January 15, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P. M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> $1-BILLION U.S. CO-OP VENTURE TO MAKE COMPUTER CHIPS FOLDS  </P> <P> A high-flying U.S. venture to regain control of the vital computer chip  industry from Japanese dominance folded today because it failed to attract  investors.  </P> <P> Santa Clara-based U.S. Memories Inc. was hailed as a $1-billion cooperative  venture by American companies, but in its seven brief months of life it failed  to make a single computer chip or earn a single dollar.  </P> <P> "I am extremely disappointed by this turn of events," Sanford L. Kane,  president of U.S. Memories, said at a news conference. "What happens today does  not bode well for an industry that has made a technical decision rather than a  tactical one."  </P> <P> Kane told the crowded news conference that the joint venture will be  "terminated," largely because of a lack of support from the electronics  industry.  </P> <P> The venture had not found a new investor since its formation last June by seven  big-name backers -- International Business Machines Corp., Digital Equipment  Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co., Intel Corp., Advanced Micro Devices Inc., National  Semiconductor Corp. and LSI Logic, according to published reports.  </P></p>

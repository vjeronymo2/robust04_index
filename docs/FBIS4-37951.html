			<p>BFN     [Text] In Islamabad, a spokesman of the Foreign Office has  welcomed the release of the two British nationals who have been  kidnapped in Indian-held Kashmir. The Government of Pakistan  condemns such wanton acts of terrorism, wherever they are  committed and whosoever is responsible for them. The spokesman  recalled that the Government of Pakistan had issued several  public appeals for the release of the kidnapped Britons. Their  return, safe and unharmed, is a matter of profound relief. The  spokesman expressed the hope that Britain and other peace-loving  states would use their influence with India to persuade the  latter to end its repression in Indian-held Kashmir which is  undoubtedly responsible for driving the hapless Kashmiris into  committing such desperate acts.</p>

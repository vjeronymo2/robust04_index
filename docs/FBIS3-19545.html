			<p>Language: <F P=105> Albanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [All names as heard] </F>   [Text] [Announcer] The Albanians in Oslo held a protest  rally with the motto "Recognize the Republic of Kosova as a  Sovereign and Neutral State." Our correspondent Antigona Qena  reports:    [Qena] A grand protest rally attended by more than 2,000  Albanians was held in the square of Oslo University, at the very  center of the city.    Fatmir Zymberi, chairman of the Kosova Democratic Alliance  [LDK] branch in Oslo, opened the rally. Pointing out that these  are difficult times -- when the Academy of Sciences and the  Albanological Intitute are being closed and the school buildings  are kept occupied in the violently conquered Kosova -- among  other things, Zyberi made an appeal to the Albanians not to  think of themselves, but to raise their voice, wherever they  are, about the free and sovereign Kosova.    A petition demanding the granting of nationhood to Kosova,  banning the Serbian terror against the Albanian population in  Kosova, demilitarizing Kosova, and placing it under an  international protectorate was also read. From this rally, the  petition was sent to UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali,  NATO, the president of the Norwegian Parliament, and the  Norwegian prime minister and foreign minister.    Then well-wishers of the Albanian people greeted the rally.  Professor Bergefuehre, who was in Kosova some time ago,  addressed a harsh protest to the Norwegian Government to change  its policy toward the Serbian Government and accept the  nationhood of the Republic of Kosova to prevent a massacre that  the spread of war could bring there.    Jon Brotnes, the Albanian honorary consul in Norway,  reminded  that Albanians are the most ancient people in the Balkans. They  will win their sovereignty, with or without the Serbs' consent,  because history is with them.    Parliamentarian Soldi Ksajli from the Christian Democratic  Party greeted the protest. She has been to Kosova and,  terrified by the situation she saw there, she appealed to the  Norwegian Government for understanding and assistance. She  promised that her own party will organize humanitarian aid in  food and medications.    Erling Forplatz from the so-called Red Alliance Party  supported the protest. He asked that the Norwegian Parliament  exert pressure on the Serbian state to grant sovereignty and  return freedom to impoverished Kosova, and together with Kosova,  to the people who emigrated to the four ends of the Earth.</p>

			<p><P> June 21, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RESIDENTS ENLIST MOLINA IN FIGHT FOR LOWER DENSITY  </P> <P> Residents of Elysian Heights have asked the Los Angeles City Council to call a  temporary halt to apartment and condominium construction in their hilly  neighborhood northwest of Dodger Stadium.  </P> <P> An informal group that recently defeated a proposal for 13 condominiums -- only  to have the developer proceed with a plan to build eight apartments instead --  has submitted about 300 signatures to Councilwoman Gloria Molina asking for a  downzoning review.  </P> <P> The petition covers 29 specific blocks within the area bounded by Scott Avenue,  Alvarado Street, Landa Street and Elysian Park.  </P> <P> Those blocks were selected because they are zoned for greater density than now  exists in the area of mostly older homes, said Valerie Tuna, leader of the  drive.  </P> <P> Molina reacted favorably to the petition, spokeswoman Alma Martinez said.  </P> <P> She plans to introduce a motion in the City Council as early as Friday to place  a temporary ban on multiple-family projects in the area and order a Planning  Department review of its zoning, Martinez said.  </P> <P> The review would be aimed at establishing zoning "to reflect the existing  community," Martinez said.  </P> <P> She said the councilwoman praised the community initiative as "a proactive way  of dealing with overdevelopment."  </P> <P> "If the residents are willing to downzone, that's usually what it takes,"  Martinez said.  </P> <P> The area is part of the Echo Park/Silver Lake community plan adopted in 1984.  </P> <P> The petition said the area has "suffered major growth pressures in the  intervening period and some inconsistent zones remain."  </P> <P> Tuna organized the neighborhood group in response to the proposal of Seabreeze  Development Co. to build condominiums on a steep parcel opposite Elysian Park.  Under community pressure, the Planning Commission denied the builder's request  for a variance to allow the condominiums. Instead, the firm has made plans to  build an eight-unit apartment, which requires no variance, Tuna said.  </P></p>

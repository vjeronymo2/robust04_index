			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Sears sought There was big turnover in Sears, with dealers reporting James Capel positive and upgrading its forecast by Pounds 30m to Pounds 198m, easily the top of the market range. The shares gained 4 1/2 to 126p in volume of 12m. Last week the stores group reported a return to profits, recording Pounds 138.3m against a Pounds 47.8m loss previously. Shares in Thorn EMI reacted cautiously to a press report that the MMC inquiry into compact disc prices had found no evidence of price-rigging by the manufacturers. The official enquiry is one of the few remaining clouds at present hanging over the stock - the others, including inquiries in the US, also into CDs, and the company's Rent-a-Centre business have faded. If yesterday's reports on the MMC move prove true, they are likely to boost sentiment. The shares added 3 to 1166p. Electrical retailer Dixons rounded off a hectic week which saw the stock receive three profit downgrades and two upgrades as the market remained deeply divided over the company's prospects. Yesterday it was the turn of Lehman Brothers to shift its forecasts and stance, upgrading its 1994-95 prediction from Pounds 80m to Pounds 85m and moving the stock from a hold to buy. The broker said the stock was only on a market rating and deserved a higher one. There was further speculation in the market that Grand Metropolitan would use its results next week to announce its divestment from its Inntrepreneur pubs business. However, the old rumour failed to generate much excitement in the shares, which ended the day a penny firmer at 467p. Confirmation of a FFr6bn rights issue from Euro Disney sent the shares down 15 to 363p. Shares in GKN jumped 7 to 624p after S G Warburg, the company's broker, issued a buy recommendation and made its first profits forecast since the group's recent acquisition of the Westland helicopter company. Warburg predicted profits of Pounds 165m this year and Pounds 220m in 1995 and said the new forecast reflected the consolidation of Westland. BBA Group moved 5 ahead to 222p in sympathy with GKN with sentiment further boosted by news of an increase in UK new car registrations. The improved new car figures also helped Inchcape, a leading car distributor, where the shares gained 10 to 548p. Engineering company IMI advanced 4 to 364p, following a favourable statement at the company's annual meeting. Enterprise Oil bounced 10 to 431p on hopes that a rival group, Atlantic Richfield, would launch a full-scale bid for Lasmo, down 2 1/2 at 147 1/2 p. Chemicals group Courtaulds fell 12 to 549p as Kleinwort Benson 're-emphasised' its sell stance on the stock. Analyst Mr Jeremy Chantry said the company's shares had outperformed the market strongly and there were concerns over rising costs of raw materials. However, he maintained his forecasts for the profit for the year to March 1994 at Pounds 170m. Zeneca rose 8 to 705p after the chairman told the annual shareholders' meeting that performance to date was in line with expectations. A positive agm statement and similarly good investment note from Henderson Crosthwaite, the stockbroker, helped Hillsdown, the food manufacturing group, climb 9 to 176p. Chairman Sir John Nott said that the outlook was encouraging and the company was confident about prospects for the year. Henderson was apparently responding to a bullish trading statement earlier this week from Bernard Matthews, the poultry producer, although other analysts said only a small part of Hillsdown's profits were poultry-related. Bernard Matthews slipped a penny to 106p. Turnover in Glenchewton, the toys and houseware group, jumped to 11.03m amid speculation that Wilton Group, a 34 per cent stake holder, had reduced its holding. Shares in Glenchewton closed unchanged at 42p, while USM-listed Wilton also remained unchanged at 3 1/2 p. British Airways remained in the doldrums after Thursday's disappointing passenger traffic figures for the month of April. The shares eased 3 to 416p. Talk of a large US seller of PowerGen saw the shares slide back 16 to 470p on turnover of 3.7m. National Power slipped 4 to 419p. Electronics group Psion advanced following remarks from the chairman at the agm. Sales in the first four months were said to be showing an advance of over 50 per cent across the product range compared to the equivalent period last year. The shares gained 12 to 296p. Reuters Holdings remained weak following the sale of stock by the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority. After the market closed the company announced that the authority now holds just over 64m shares in the company or some 4 per cent. Biotrace, the microbiological testing company, jumped 27 to 152p after a positive announcement on its marketing agreement with Ecolab, the US manufacturer of sanitising equipment.</p>

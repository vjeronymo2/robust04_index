			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / Whitewater probe plea by Panetta The White House yesterday urged the new Whitewater special counsel not to reopen investigations already resolved by his predecessor. Mr Leon Panetta, the chief of staff, said he hoped Mr Kenneth Starr would 'not trample over old territory time and time again.' Mr Starr said he came to the job with 'no preconceptions' but declined all substantive comment pending discussions due to start tomorrow with his predecessor, Mr Robert Fiske, who has already cleared government officials of attempting to obstruct justice. Mr Panetta also insisted that 'at this point in time' President Bill Clinton retained full confidence in senior treasury and White House personnel, including Mr Roger Altman, the deputy secretary of the treasury. Mr Lloyd Cutler, White House legal counsel, said Mr Altman had been a key member of the team responsible for the current economic expansion. Mr Altman's resignation has been demanded by several members of Congress because he had briefed the White House on the status of criminal investigations into Madison Guaranty. This is the now defunct Arkansas savings and loan bank implicated in the real estate ventures and financial dealings of Mr and Mrs Clinton in their home state over the last 15 years. Mr Starr, a federal judge appointed by President Ronald Reagan and later solicitor general in the Bush administration, was named late on Friday to take over from Mr Fiske by a special judicial panel acting under the terms of the renewed Independent Counsel Act. The panel said it was not impugning Mr Fiske's integrity but that the investigation should be conducted by someone not appointed by the administration. The selection of Mr Starr comes as a disappointment to the White House, and not merely because it had no reason to be displeased with Mr Fiske's findings to date. A new independent counsel suggests a longer investigation, with a final report conceivably delayed until the 1996 presidential election year. Last January Mr Starr was on the shortlist considered by Ms Janet Reno, the attorney general, before she named Mr Fiske, a lifelong Republican. But some of Mr Starr's subsequent comments have been seen as hostile to the president. This summer, he took public issue with Mr Cutler's contention that civil lawsuits against a sitting president (in this instance the sexual harassment-related case brought by Ms Paula Jones) should be deferred until the president had left office. Mr Starr found this argument 'astonishing' and reportedly considered filing an 'amicus curiae' brief on Ms Jones's behalf. The circumstances of his appointment to the Whitewater case are also controversial. Last month, a group of right-wing members of congress wrote to Judge David Sentelle, head of the special panel, complaining about Mr Fiske's impartiality, as did Mr Floyd Brown, an ultra-conservative activist. Judge Sentelle, a Reagan appointee to the bench refused to comment on whether these letters had played any part in the panel's deliberations. No mention of them was made in its ruling, however.

			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / UK Company News: Hewden Stuart's Pounds 15m beats City forecasts HEWDEN STUART, Britain's second largest independent plant hire company, easily beat analysts' expectations with pre-tax profits of Pounds 15m for the year to January 31. The results, struck on turnover 16 per cent lower at Pounds 170.9m, showed a 40 per cent drop on the previous year's Pounds 25.2m compared to some expectations of up to 50 per cent. Sir Matthew Goodwin, chairman, said the achievement had been 'tremendous. We are very, very satisfied.' He was optimistic that the group was facing the end of a recession which has savaged the plant hire sector. The first signs of recovery were being reported in the south of England, he said. 'It's not enough to write home about, but there's a little improvement.' There had been no upturn in the north and Scotland, however. He was less than optimistic about the effects of a possible Labour government after the election. 'It would set the whole thing extremely back,' he said. During 1991, conditions had been difficult and became even more competitive as the year progressed. 'Prices are still abysmal,' he said. Nevertheless, tight control of capital expenditure and costs, and concentration on cash flow had helped the group to wipe out debt of Pounds 8m and end the year with Pounds 7m cash. Thus, it could propose a token increase in the final dividend to 2.285p (2.175p) for a total of 3.15p (3p). Earnings per share fell from 9.14p to 5.35p. 'We are sitting on a pile of assets and have no form of commitments,' Sir Matthew said. This would allow the company to acquire new plant when the upturn eventually arrived. The biggest damper on profits was the decline in sales at the tower crane hire division, from Pounds 12.7m to Pounds 6.5m. This was partly the result of completing phase one at Canary Wharf, in London's Docklands. Sir Matthew said Hewden had received all payments from Olympia &amp; York, the heavily-indebted property group which owns the development. The sale of new construction equipment also suffered a sharp decline, profits falling from Pounds 1.9m to Pounds 660,000. Sales of second hand plant contributed Pounds 3.5m, compared with Pounds 4.5m last time. Bad debts totalled Pounds 1.7m (Pounds 2m). This was the result of a string of small companies failing 'day after day', Sir Matthew said. COMMENT Yet again the worthy Hewden Stuart shines out in a ravaged sector. To report profits at all would be considered by many to be good work; but to do so after a Pounds 25m depreciation charge and a Pounds 500,000 writedown on an investment at the same time as eliminating debt and building Pounds 7m cash is commendable. Then look at the relatively modern fleet, allowing lower repair and maintenance charges than competitors, and Hewden looks set to clean up in an economic recovery . . . as long as one is within sight. The only sting in the tail could be another drop in the construction sector. Forecasts were revised upwards from Pounds 11m to about Pounds 15m for the year, putting the shares on a multiple of about 17. Although this looks high, considering the good cash management and future prospects it is still good value for the medium to long-termers.</p>

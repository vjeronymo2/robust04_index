			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / US trade deficit in 1991 narrows sharply to Dollars 66bn A COMBINATION of recession and robust export growth led to a sharp narrowing of the US trade deficit last year, the Commerce Department reported yesterday. The merchandise trade deficit fell to Dollars 66.2bn (Pounds 37.8bn) compared with Dollars 101.7bn in 1990, ending a seven-year string of Dollars 100bn-plus deficits. Figures for December, however, showed a widening of the monthly deficit to Dollars 5.9bn against Dollars 4.2bn in November. The deterioration, concentrated mainly in capital goods, reflected a Dollars 1bn rise in imports to Dollars 42.1bn and a Dollars 0.8bn fall in exports to Dollars 36.1bn. The improvement in the deficit last year reflected a 7 per cent increase in exports and a 1.5 per cent decline in imports. Exports of manufactured goods rose 9.3 per cent, indicating that US industry is more competitive in world markets. US trade performance improved against most regions: the US surplus with western Europe, for example, rose to Dollars 16.1bn compared with Dollars 4.0bn in 1990. The bilateral deficit with Japan, however, widened from Dollars 41.1bn to Dollars 43.4bn. Many analysts expect a fresh deterioration of the overall trade deficit this year. Imports are expected to rise sharply if the domestic economy recovers from recession. Weaker demand in overseas markets may curb export growth. Nearly four in 10 Americans believe their personal finances have worsened under the Bush administration, Money magazine said in a poll released yesterday, AP reports from New York. The poll also found that one in five Americans, when surveyed last year, believed the country was in the beginning of a depression. Money further found that 30 per cent of all consumers will continue to spend less money after the downturn ends.</p>

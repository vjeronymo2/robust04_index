			<p>BFN     [Text] Jinan, 30 Apr (XINHUA) -- During a recent  inspection of rural work in Shandong, Comrade Song Ping said:  Whether or not agriculture, the foundation of our economy, can  really be strengthened is a major issue that concerns the whole  nation's food supply, the entire national economy's development,  as well as social stability. We should not neglect agriculture  at any time and under any circumstances and instead should try  every possible means to ensure its even more rapid and greater  development.    From 19 through 30 April, Song Ping successively inspected  work in nine counties under Weifang and Zibo Cities in the  separate company of CPC Central Committee Political Bureau  Member and Shandong Provincial CPC Committee Secretary Jiang  Chunyun, provincial CPC Committee Deputy Secretary and Governor  Zhao Zhihao, provincial CPC Committee Deputy Secretary and  Secretary General Han Xikai. He went deep into enterprises,  villages, peasant families, and paddy fields to talk with  grass-roots cadres and the masses of peasants. Song Ping said:  To strengthen agriculture's status as the foundation of the  economy, we must keep on increasing investment; great  development will not come without considerable investment. It  is necessary to establish and improve a new agricultural  investment mechanism to increase investment in agriculture  through a variety of channels. The state will increase  investment, but this alone will not be enough. We should make  full use of surplus labor in the rural area and attach  importance to accumulation of labor results. At the same time,  we should guide village and town enterprises into supplementing  agriculture with industry and institutionalize and standardize  this practice as early as possible to guarantee actual extension  of funds for supporting agriculture.    Song Ping went straight to villages and peasant families  every time he arrived at a county. When inspecting village and  town enterprises, he said: Developing village and town  enterprises is an important way for the rural area to march  toward a comparatively well-off standard of living. Sole  reliance on farming is not enough to bring about a comparatively  well-off standard of living in the countryside; you must  vigorously develop village and town enterprises. Shandong's  village and town enterprises have been enjoying rapid and  healthy development since reform and opening up to the outside  world and have now developed into a major sector. For the period  ahead, Shandong should continue to make full use of village and  town enterprises' flexible mechanisms and center on the main  objective of establishing a socialist market economy to  intensify reform and promote improvement in the standard,  product quality, and operating scale of village and town  enterprises.    During his inspection, Song Ping also stated his views on  issues such as strengthening the development of grass-roots  party organizations and developing household garden farming.</p>

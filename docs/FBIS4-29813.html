			<p>BFN     [Text] JAKARTA, June 22 (AFP) -- Indonesian students and  journalists demonstrated here Wednesday against the banning of  three weekly newspapers, while even a military spokesman  distanced himself from the government move.    More than 200 students and journalists staged a noisy  protest  in front of the information ministry, saying the government ban  had "killed" democracy in the country.    One march involving around 150 people went to the ministry  from the offices of the Legal Aid Institute (LBH), a human  rights group. Scores of others went from the premises of the  weekly DETIK tabloid, one of the publications banned.    Security officials confiscated banners critical of  Information Minister Harmoko, but took several journalists,  student and human rights representatives into the ministry. LBH  chairman Adnan Buying was among them.    After failing to meet ministry officials, the demonstrators  promised to return on Thursday with a bigger rally behind them.    The government announced Tuesday that publishing licences  for  DETIK, EDITOR and TEMPO, the country's biggest selling  newspaper, had been withdrawn. The authorities quoted  administrative reasons for the ban on EDITOR and DETIK. TEMPO  was banned because of its editorial content, an information  ministry official said.    But all three publications had written articles critical of  research and technology ministry Bacharuddin Jusuf Habibie, an  ally of President Suharto.    A military spokesman, meanwhile, said the ban should not  have  happened, a press report said.    "I am close to the press and of course I do not want this  situation to occur," the SUARA PEMBARUAN daily quoted military  spokesman Brigadier General Syarwan Hamid as saying. "I hope the  press can learn a lesson from it."    Syarwan said he was concerned at the ban and added that the  information ministry should have considered the move carefully  before acting.    He said the government wanted to develop openness, but that  the press had to use the opportunity positively.    "Don't let the openness create a bad situation and tragedy.  That is not, of course, what we want," he said.    Eros Jarot, chief editor of DETIK, and his counterpart from  Tempo, Gunawan Muhamad, met Wednesday and later appeared among  the students with calls to remain calm.    Jarot said however the country was entering a "clouded" era  because of the government move. Jarot called on the government  to make clear the motives behind the ban.    Petitions distributed by journalists during the protests  said  the ban breached constitutional guarantees of freedom of  expression.    TEMPO and DETIK have recently reported on a rift between  Habibie and the armed forces and finance ministry over the  purchase of 39 former East German ships.    Editor this month published a cover story on plans to set up  a nationalist student movement, led by Transmigration Minister  Siswono Yudohusodo, to rival Habibie's Indonesian Moslems  Intellectual Association.</p>

"It is the last  viewpoint I am taking into consideration at the moment," he  added.    Klaus said, however, that such an approach could prove to be  no good as "every such interference costs something." "I have  an impression that I should play a role of a financier at the  moment and start counting how much it will cost," Klaus said.  He added, however, that the idea of state administration reform  demanded "deeper discussion."    The supposition that "all things should always be done  closer  to citizens, is only half correct," Klaus said. "It is  certainly not true that we should conduct foreign policy closer  to the people and solve the basic problems of the army and this  country's defence closer to the people," Klaus said.    He said he firmly believed the government would manage to  resolve "the deepest conceptual questions" connected with the  reform during January and would meet the timetable set for state  administration reform. That means that draft proposal for  competitions to be invested into higher self-governing units  would be completed, he said.    Speaking about the role of the state in society, Klaus said  this role should be "extremely small." He added, however, that  as a representative of the state he could not consider the state  its major enemy but should on the contrary try to do his utmost  for the state to function well and bring "something positive to  the people."    Klaus said that the opportunities for businessmen in the  Czech Republic to make a profit without offering the right  quality of their goods or services were diminishing and this  process was irreversible. He said ethics and morality on one  side and a market economy on the other do not exclude each other  but are interconnected. "Any attempts to separate these things  are bad... because they are the two sides of one coin," Klaus  said.</p>

			<p>930524 FT  24 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: Brands With the Marlboro cowboy revealed as a bit of a wimp and BSN admitting mineral water may be little more than water after all, worry about the demise of the brand is flavour of the month. UK investors, though, have had nothing to learn that they did not already know. For years, the competitive UK food market has stripped commodity businesses and poorly-managed brands of their value. Companies, like Hillsdown Holdings and Ranks Hovis McDougall, have suffered in this way. UK food retailers have been in the vanguard of developing private label products: J. Sainsbury's Novon detergent range shows it can penetrate the best defended markets. The emergence of more discount retailers will further exacerbate competition. Their growth may win them greater buying discounts which they can pass on to shoppers, building structural deflation into the system. The recent spell of low inflation  - and even severe deflation in some products - has made life painful for brand managers. Such trends mean industry polarisation will accelerate. Only strong and innovative manufacturers, such as Unilever and Cadbury Schweppes, are likely to survive in the branded game. Failure, though, does not necessarily spell financial ruin. Northern Foods shows respectable returns can be achieved from manufacturing retailers' own label products. The beneficiaries of the branded manufacturers' discomfort should logically be the food retailers. Curiously, the stock market has de-rated their shares too. This may reflect the turn in the investment cycle. It also suggests the big superstores' own brand franchises are threatened by the discounters.</p>

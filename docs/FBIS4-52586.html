			<p>BFN     [Text] With regard to the question of whether (former  Prime Minister) Morihiro Hosokawa should resign as leader of the  Japan New Party [JNP], there is a rapidly increasing number of  party members who hold the view that "he has no other choice but  to resign." There has been growing criticism against his  Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]-oriented management of party  affairs.    The Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and other parties have  also made an official request to summon Hosokawa as witness in  connection with his loan from the Sagawa Kyubin trucking  company. Therefore, most party members have come to the  conclusion that "if Hosokawa remains in the post of party head,  the party's split will be inevitable," (as stated by a senior  JNP official). Hosokawa disclosed at a meeting of JNP Diet  members of both houses on 9 May that he will hold a national  meeting of party representatives as early as 21 May to hear  their opinions on this matter. However, there is a possibility  that he will announce his intention to resign before this  meeting.    The JNP held separate meetings of Diet members according to  their seniority on 9 May to discuss party management and other  topics. The prevailing view among the participants was: "To  rebuild the party, there is no other way but for Mr. Hosokawa to  resign voluntarily." If Hosokawa should resign, it is certain  that the party executives, who have been criticized for their  stand on party management, will also be replaced. On the other  hand, JNP members who have been considering leaving the party  are now inclined to think that "if the leadership changes, this  will open up prospects for the party's renewal." Mass secession  is likely to be averted for the time being.</p>

			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / Letter: Czech move towards capitalism Sir, As directors of the sixth largest privatisation fund in the Czech Republic - and one which has not promised any inflated returns - we believe that it is your leader that is confused by coupon privatisation ('No free lunch', August 21). We are regulated by the Investment Fund Law of Czechoslovakia and licensed by the Czech Ministry of Privatisation. We often find our meetings with Czech managers - discussing the restructuring plans for the companies that they manage but we will own on behalf of our shareholders - constructive and useful. Frequently, representatives of the companies' new foreign partners are also present at these meetings. Are you implying that companies such as Nestle, BSN, Philip Morris, Glaverbel, Holderbank and Dow Chemical, to name but a few, are not able to produce competent management for Czech companies? The combination of coupon privatisation with direct foreign investment into the same company will definitely contribute, to quote from your leader, to 'spreading wealth among the citizens, injecting new skills into the economy and creating tradeable financial assets'. Czechoslovak economic reform cannot be looked at partially, being a three-pronged approach to the problems of the former command economy: first, macroeconomic stabilisation with tight control of government budgets combined with a stable money policy; second, privatisation both of large enterprises and small businesses; third, restitution, recreating a property-owning middle class. We believe, unlike yourselves, that the success of this triple approach  - with six-month interbank rates at approximately 12.5 per cent, the large company privatisation mentioned above and the plethora of new small and restituted businesses - is giving capitalism an excellent name] N P Williams, M Vetrovsky, I Vohlmuth, Creditanstalt Investment Company, Vorsilkska 5, 110 00, Praha 1, Czechoslovakia</p>

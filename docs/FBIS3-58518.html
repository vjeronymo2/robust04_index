			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial signed "Rau": "The Trip"] </F>   [Text] What will Bill Clinton take home from his trip to  Europe and Russia? First of all, two new saxophones. He  received one in Belgium and one from Vaclav Havel.    What else? Clinton again staged a perfect show in front of  skeptical Europeans and half-interested Russians. What was the  substance of his visit? Clinton made the East Europeans accept  the second-best solution (Partnership for Peace) instead of NATO  membership (they really had no choice). He dodged the issue of  Bosnia; he made Ukraine renounce its nuclear weapons (for the  time being), and he promised Yeltsin a great deal of money.    All in all, this is not a bad result. However -- and this is  typical of Clinton -- numerous issues remain unsettled. How  much is the Partnership for Peace really worth? Will the  agreement with Ukraine hold? And: How important is Yeltsin  still?</p>

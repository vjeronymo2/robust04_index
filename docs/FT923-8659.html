			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / Copyright fears for address database THE ROYAL Mail is worried that draft legislation approved earlier this year by the European Commission will strip its Postal Address File - the official list of UK postcodes - of its copyright protection, David Owen writes. Ironically, the draft directive is intended to provide protection for producers of databases. It would outlaw unfair copying of the contents of databases such as computerised address lists for 10 years. But lists such as the file, which have been in existence for more than 10 years, would not benefit from this protection. Meanwhile, UK regulations - which unusually already give copyright protection to the type of database covered by the directive - would cease to apply. The Royal Mail is concerned that adoption of the directive - part of a growing body of agreed or draft EC legislation on intellectual property  - would undermine Britain's position of having arguably the best protection for databases among EC states. It has been advised that the proposed legislation may actually put British database owners in a worse position than their European counterparts because of the strength of the laws on unfair competition that apply in other countries. In the year to March, the list generated some Pounds 2m of revenue for Royal Mail, whose pre-tax profits rose to Pounds 266m. The organisation, which the government is considering selling, handles 61m letters a day.</p>

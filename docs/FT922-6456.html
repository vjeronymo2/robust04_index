			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / Minding Your Own Business: Floating a theatre company - How Walk the Plank got their financial act together and took to the sea THE Fitzcarraldo is an iron-clad Norwegian island ferry formerly named the Bjarkov. It bears little resemblance to the 350-ton steamship Werner Herzog hauled through the jungle in his film about building an opera house in Amazonia, from which the old ferry gets its new name, except in the proportions of its voyage and the dreams which made it possible. The ship sailed into the grey waters of Glasson Dock, just south of Lancaster, early in the New Year. The storms had been tremendous, the wait in the Caledonian Canal long and expensive, but at last she arrived to dwarf every other vessel in the marina and capture the imagination of the small fishing village. The adventure had begun. The Fitzcarraldo is the achievement of a dream for John Wassell and Liz Pugh and their company Walk the Plank, the 'world's first marine theatre contractors.' Their vision: to tour a theatre ship around the beaches and docks of Britain during the summer. There are two shows: one an extravagant fairy tale with a 'green' environmental theme, written for them by Adrian Mitchell, the poet and playwright; the other a pyrotechnic spectacular for up to 2,000 people, combining music, magic, drama and dance with fireworks. The project has attracted arts departments around the coast, and the ship is booked from May to September. It started at the Brighton Festival last week and arrives in Folkestone today. 'I think people like the spirit of adventure, the romance of it appeals,' says Liz. 'And conventional arts departments know that people who wouldn't necessarily buy tickets for the theatre or go to an art gallery might come and see our show.' Bringing the dream to life has been hard work. Their success in selling the tour, raising a Pounds 40,000 Arts Council grant and an Pounds 82,000 bank loan secured by the Small Firms Loan Guarantee scheme - no mean achievement in the depths of recession - has been dulled somewhat by the extra costs of the delays en route from Norway and of converting the ship to UK marine specifications. But enthusiasm has not dimmed. The bank manager was persuaded (with difficulty) to extend the loan, the decks and sides of the ship were transformed with riotous paintwork, the rear deck has been converted into a seating area for an audience of 150 and the company of performers and musicians is ready for anything the seas can throw at it. 'The project has a momentum that can't be stopped,' says Liz Pugh, a former marketing and publicity officer for Manchester's Royal Exchange Theatre, the arts company Welfare State International ('engineers of the imagination'), and Barrow Borough Council. Her experience of boats was limited to the Norfolk Broads until three years ago, when she and John Wassell bought a wooden launch which proved the starting point for the Fitzcarraldo project. They spent the summers of 1989 and 1990 touring the Scottish islands with the Boat Band, literally singing for their supper. 'That was the springboard for this idea, to expand it into a show on a ship, although it was a leap of the imagination from a 50ft boat to a 120ft ship with a 28ft beam.' For John, a builder of wooden narrow boats before a five-year stint as project director for WSI, it was a lesser leap. Having organised large, site-specific events for WSI, and experienced the immense cost of touring, he realised that keeping everything on board ship would cut costs. As Liz explains: 'Moving people and large props around is a costly process, but on board it all comes in one little steel package: our total fuel bill for the summer is Pounds 5,000 (for 12 venues) - a fraction of the cost of bed and breakfast and transport. 'One of the disadvantages of touring Europe is the costs involved. The idea should hold good for plans to take the show abroad in future years.' Glasson Dock is a small village but it has taken Liz and John to its heart. Over the last three years the couple have turned the traditional Bonfire Night of November 5 into a community event for 1,500 people, with a children's lantern procession and a 30-strong organising committee. Word about the Fitzcarraldo project spread like wildfire. 'They all knew the ship was coming because we sold them sea miles to raise funds,' Liz said, 'and then it took so long, two months instead of three weeks, that when it arrived it was very exciting. We were inundated with offers of anything from carpets to welding equipment, and all offers of help (there was a constant stream of willing helpers) were accepted.' Money may be tight indeed, but when the ship sailed at the beginning of May there was a distinct feeling that, if nothing else, the goodwill of the community alone would keep it afloat.</p>

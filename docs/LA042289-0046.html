			<p><P> April 22, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BOARD APPROVES NEW SITE FOR FAIR  </P> <P> Encouraged by a warm welcome from nearby Lake View Terrace homeowners, the San  Fernando Valley Fair board voted Friday to move a scaled-down version of the  annual fair to Hansen Dam.  </P> <P> The location is less than ideal, board members said, because to win consent  from nearby homeowners and the Los Angeles Department of Recreation and Parks,  they agreed to ban carnival rides, concerts and sale of alcoholic drinks. Those  were the major money-makers at past fairs.  </P> <P> The fair, scheduled for July 14 to 16, will be restricted to such traditional  country fair offerings as livestock exhibits, harvest celebrations, banjo  contests, lumberjack competitions and craft booths.  </P> <P> A year ago, the fair was ousted from Cal State Northridge after 13 years to  make way for campus expansion. A tentative agreement to use a 30-acre cornfield  at Pierce College fell through after Woodland Hills homeowners and the Los  Angeles Community College District objected, saying the fair did not fit the  college's master plan.  </P></p>

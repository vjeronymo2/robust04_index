			<p>940616 FT  16 JUN 94 / Technology: Simple idea, big savings - A look at the success of EMC's electronic filing cabinets The mother of an executive with EMC, the US data storage company, has problems understanding what her son's company does. He explains the Dollars 782m (Pounds 521m) turnover operation succinctly. 'We make electronic filing cabinets.' At Dollars 4.1m a throw, this is a gross simplification. But EMC's rise to eminence in a Dollars 5bn market still largely an IBM fief owes much to simple ideas. Disk arrays are the storage component of mainframe computer systems. Traditionally, the information these large machines handle has been held on disks resembling long-playing records. EMC moved to smaller 5.25-inch disks similar to the hard disk inside a personal computer. This meant a massive reduction in space, and hence the heat generated by the storage system. Ventilation bills plummeted. EMC's latest top-of-the-range model stores one terabyte (1,000 gigabytes) of information - the equivalent of 40,000 four-drawer filing cabinets or 10,000 standard desktop PCs. In the previous generation of disk systems, a terabyte took up 400 sq ft. The IBM disk storage system holding this much data occupies as much space as a two-car garage. The EMC model, looking like a three-door wardrobe filled with shelves of computer disks, occupies 17 sq ft. Mike Ruettgers, head of EMC since 1989, claims that a US customer switching to EMC from IBM will save Dollars 1m over five years in maintenance, cooling, power and floor space. In the UK, the information technology arm of British Steel, CMS, has replaced its IBM data storage products with four EMC units. The last EMC unit cost Pounds 300,000, but is expected to save CMS Pounds 112,000 in electricity and air conditioning bills over the next four years. Ruettgers was hired at a time of crisis for EMC. In 1988, components from a Japanese supplier started failing. Ruettgers bought in fault-free disk drives from IBM and installed them free. Despite a Dollars 100m bill for replacing disk drives, Ruettgers claims most customers stuck with EMC. The experience left EMC with a paranoid regard for quality control and testing. Each disk array is now tested for up to 24 days. While IBM remains a fierce rival, with 52 per cent of the mainframe storage market, other large computer concerns buy in products from EMC. Bull of France and Unisys of the US both resell EMC disk arrays in tandem with their systems. IBM argues that until now, smaller disk systems have lacked reliability. While one failure every 15,000 hours might have been tolerable on PCs five years ago, it would not do for dozens of disks running simultaneously 24 hours a day. Now, IBM is poised to launch a data storage machine running 3.5-inch disks, beating EMC at its own game and gunning for its smaller rival on price. Ruettgers thinks EMC can stay ahead by remembering the customer's primary concern. The enormous data-processing needs of banks and airlines generate unwelcome bills in support services. Swissair and Direct Line insurance of the UK are customers. EMC knows its target - '70 per cent of dp (data processing) dollar is maintenance and enhancement,' says Ruettgers, who previously worked in the US missile industry. Market analysts predict nine-fold growth in large data storage capacity by the end of the decade. Although small, powerful workstations have taken over many of the mainframe's functions, the information storage needs of service industries mean vast archives of digital data must be kept somewhere. Squeezing more data into less space for a lower cost is the perpetual rallying cry of the IT industry. EMC knows its doubling of turnover between 1992 and 1994 cannot be maintained, but the demand for economical mass storage is there in abundance.</p>

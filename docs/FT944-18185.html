			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / IMF/World Bank in Madrid: Ecuador signs deal on debt of Dollars 7.8bn Ecuador yesterday signed an agreement with about 300 private creditors, led by international banks, to restructure its Dollars 7.8bn (Pounds 5bn) of external commercial debt. About 99 per cent of creditors, in a deal that coincided with the IMF meeting in Madrid, agreed to terms offered in June. Sir David Walker, deputy chairman of Lloyds Bank, which led the negotiating committee of banks, called for Ecuador to allow its creditors to take part in a forthcoming privatisation programme through equity swaps. Among the largest creditors agreeing to the restructuring was the Dart family of the US, which acquired its debt in the secondary market. The Darts are suing Brazil in the US courts over its debt restructuring. One banker said Ecuador had been more successful in dealing with private creditors such as the Darts because 'it was aware that it was dealing with more than banks, and it was careful to maintain a dialogue'. The Dollars 2.5bn of past due interest which has accumulated on the principal debt will be repaid by Ecuador issuing 20-year bonds which have a 10-year grace period before principal repayments fall due. During the first six years, Ecuador can choose whether to pay the coupon on these bonds in full, or pay a lower coupon and capitalise the balance. It can thus reduce the initial burden of repayments. Sir David said that the deal was 'sensitive to the needs of Ecuador' but it was 'vital that a track record of uninterrupted payments is now established'. Ecuador started failing to meet interest payments in 1987. Mr Modesto Correa, the Ecuadorean minister of finance, said that the country was 'now poised to return to the international capital markets, and resume its place as a member of the international financial community'. He said the government was committed to a process of economic stabilisation and structural reform, and the debt burden had been 'a grave obstacle' to progress. The package, modelled on similar agreements pioneered by Mr Nicholas Brady, former US treasury secretary, offered holders of debt principal a choice between exchanging it for two types of 30-year bonds.</p>

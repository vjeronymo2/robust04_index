			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Election '92: Lilley hears a few home truths MR JOHN LLOYD, managing director of Betterware, one of Britain's fastest growing companies, was in full flow. Statistics on every detail of the meteoric rise of the Sutton Coldfield group, which sells home products door-to-door, flowed over a quietly admiring Mr Peter Lilley, the trade and industry secretary. It was an ideal example for the Tory case for a free-market, low-taxation, non-interventionist industrial strategy. Mr Lloyd and a team of managers bought the then ailing Betterware, for Pounds 250,000 in 1985, and transformed it into a business with a market capitalisation of more than Pounds 100m. This was the kind of inspirational success story Mr Lilley needed to hear as he went forth to warn business of the grave risks of turning their backs on Conservative policies to lift burdens from business, cut taxes to motivate managers and crush union power. So, what would be the best thing the next government could do for a business such as Betterware, someone asked. Mr Lloyd shot back: 'Bring in higher capital allowances to help us with investment.' Mr Lilley was silent. Mr Lloyd had endorsed Labour's main policy to help industry. It was a similar story wherever Mr Lilley went that day. Business leaders displayed unswerving support for the Conservatives as the party of enterprise. But on specific measures to combat the recession they invariably found merit in Labour's approach. At IPW, a manufacturer of heat-treatment equipment next door to Betterware, the managing director told Mr Lilley it was prospering by getting into specialist markets. But the sales director remarked: 'The most important thing a new government could do is to deal with the short termism of the banks.' Over afternoon tea with a group of Tory business supporters Mr Lilley got off to a good start. Yet after accepting some open invitations to attack Labour links with the unions and its tax plans the going got tougher. Mr David Smith, who provides small businesses with advertising services, said: 'There is a terribly jittery feeling, whenever the phone rings, that it is someone else going down the tube.' Mr Lilley's reply was limp. There were no policy responses, just a recitation of the statistic that a lot of businesses were being created in spite of the recession. A builder chipped in: 'The problem is that asset values have fallen so banks will not accept property as collateral for businesses. The banking system has a stranglehold on investment. The government had to find a way of opening up funds for investment.' The proposal fell on stony ground. Mr Charles McEwan, a Conservative district councillor, recommended the government steal some of Labour's clothes by allowing councils to use receipts from council-house sales to start a building programme to stimulate the construction sector. As Mr Lilley sped off to an evening business forum, his tour was yielding an inescapable conclusion: business executives instinctively trust the Tories and want a Tory government for their personal pockets. But in the short term they recognise, perhaps unwillingly, that Labour's policies could bring more benefits to their companies.</p>

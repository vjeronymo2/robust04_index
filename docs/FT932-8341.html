			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Concentric profits expand to Pounds 4.35m CONCENTRIC, the Birmingham-based engineering and components group, raised pre-tax profits from Pounds 3.52m to Pounds 4.35m in the six months ended March 31 1993. Mr Tony Firth, chairman, said hopes that difficulties in continental European markets would be mitigated by the September devaluation of sterling had not been fulfilled 'as smoothly as had been hoped'. The reasons were customers' resistance to price increases, rises in the costs of raw materials and the severity of the 'collapse' in European markets. Turnover on continuing operations rose to Pounds 60.7m (Pounds 58.7m) of which 28 per cent was exported. Margins improved by a fifth to more than 7 per cent. More than half of turnover serves the automotive industry. The group had been somewhat protected from the car industry's downturn because it makes parts for a range of automotive products from tractors to racing cars. Concentric Pumps, which supplies oil and water pumps to diesel engines, was the biggest single contributor to sales after 'problems a couple of years ago' had been resolved. Sales of satellite dishes were poor, partly for cyclical reasons. A stock adjustment was in progress because of changed technical standards. The group was 'cash positive' following last year's Pounds 12.5m rights issue. Capital expenditure so far this year, mainly on buildings, was already more than the Pounds 4.5m spent last year. An unchanged interim dividend of 1.77p is declared out of earnings of 5.63p (5.38p).</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Ambassador Ahmad Hajjaj, OAU </F> assistant secretary general, in Addis Ababa by Shihatah  Abu-al-Majd in Cairo; date not given--recorded]    [Excerpt] [Abu-al-Majd] How will the recent fighting  between troops belonging to General Mohamed Farah Aidid and  those belonging to General Morgan affect the reconciliation and  accord process in Somalia?    [Hajjaj] Any fighting in Somalia is unfortunate because it  will necessarily affect Somali security, on which the  international community has spent a lot of effort and money.  Any aggression against organizations operating in Somalia,  particularly UN troops, should be condemned strongly. The whole  world is watching Somalia as the deadline for the withdrawal of  international troops nears. Any fighting or any injury among the  UN or other international relief agency workers will trigger a  bad reaction. The international community will be dissuaded  from granting relief aid to the Somali people, who have suffered  enough as a result of the infighting.    [Abu-al-Majd] Observers believe that the recent fighting  might have been the prologue for large-scale fighting, since the  Somali factions are now stockpiling weapons to prepare for the  withdrawal of most Western troops by 31 March. Do you agree  with this view?    [Hajjaj] Yes. Many signs indicate that some Somali factions  are currently mobilizing and arming their troops to engage in  further fighting and bring further destruction to the Somali  people. This is what international observers fear, the OAU  included. As I said before, the international community has  spent a lot of money and effort in Somalia. If the Somali  factions continue to fight among themselves and if the  subsequent displacement of hundreds of thousands of people and  the destruction of the infrastructure continue, the  international community will not pay the issue the same  attention it is giving it now. The leaders of the Somali  factions should realize this is a serious matter, and the  reasonable Somali people must prevent such massacres.    [Abu-al-Majd] What role will the OAU play in the coming  stage  to prevent such infighting?    [Hajjaj] The OAU maintains contacts with the Somali  factions.  It welcomes any contact from these factions to establish peace  and stability in Somalia. We urge the African states that have  troops operating in Somalia not to withdraw these troops,  because African states have committed themselves to help the  Somali people. We do not want African states to withdraw their  troops like other non-African states. Moreover, the Somali  factions must stop the fruitless infighting. No faction will be  left to take charge of the ruling process if it thinks that more  fighting will allow it to strengthen its position. Certainly,  other factions will emerge to resist it. Accord must prevail  among all Somali factions.    [Abu-al-Majd] With the approach of the date of the Western  troop withdrawal from Somalia, are you coordinating with the  United Nations so that Western troops can be replaced by African  or Islamic troops?    [Hajjaj] There are contacts between the OAU and the United  Nations. This coordination can be enhanced. As you know, the  OAU ministerial council emphasized in its latest meeting that  there should be constant coordination between the OAU and the  United Nations. Our goals are the same even though our  resources are not. The joint goal is to establish peace and  stability so that the long-overdue reconstruction process can be  launched. The longer this process is delayed, the less  attention the international community pays to the Somali issue.  There are other world problems that command world attention,  like the former Soviet republics, the former Yugoslavia, and  others. [passage omitted]</p>

Lenin, and the Republic Clinical  Hospital, Republic of Tatarstan Ministry of Health; UDC  658.387.003.1]    [Text] The new economic mechanism of managing the public  health system based on economic methods began with experiments  conducted in 1988 in St. Petersburg and in Kemerovo and Samara  oblasts. Study of the results of this experiment, analysis of  available literature and familiarization with the principles of  organizing and managing a public health system in a number of  countries and republics permitted us to develop our own concept  for transition of a large multiprofile treatment and diagnosis  complex, such as the Republic Clinical Hospital, to economic  methods of management and administration. Two basic principles  were laid at the basis of this concept: first, the principle of  raising the level and quality of medical assistance provided to  patients, achieved by way of a new mechanism of planning,  financing, administering and controlling the quality of the  treatment and diagnosis process, and evaluating the activity of  the entire hospital as a whole and each of each structural  subdivisions; second, the principle of fundamentally changing  the hospital's financing to settling accounts with each cured  patient rather than allocating a budget for the entire year.    Three basic stages can be clearly delineated in the  practical  implementation of this concept. The first stage (preparatory)  embraced the period up to April 1991. It included economic  training for physicians and secondary medical personnel in a  program set up by us, study of existing experience, development  of our own variant of clinical-statistical groups and the  principles of settling mutual accounts and of medical and  financial document turnover, and calculation of the cost of  medical services.    Clinical-statistical groups were formed by the directors and  physicians of the hospital's departments on the basis of an  analysis of the structure of hospital morbidity over the 3  preceding years. By breaking down the diagnostic and treatment  process into days of the patient's hospital stay, we were able  to create flow charts on the basis of which a list of prices of  medical services was formed.    The new functional interrelationships between clinical  departments, the hospital statistical service, the automated  control system division, the planning and financial division and  the accounting office brought about the need for making certain  changes in the official accounting forms used in statistical and  financial document turnover, and for developing the procedures  of working with these documents.    The first stage of introducing the economic mechanism of  management had as its result an agreement between the Ministry  of Health of the Republic of Tatarstan and the Republic Clinical  Hospital, as well as agreements between the administration and  the hospital's departments. According to the agreement the  Republic Clinical Hospital obligated itself to organize  treatment and diagnosis in the hospital's departments and in the  polyclinic, and consultative and emergency aid in the rayons,  through the efforts of its associates and at a certain level of  work quality. In the meantime the Health Ministry will provide  financing to the Republic Clinical Hospital for each patient who  is cured or receives consultation in accordance with a price  list, and with regard for the treatment results. As an  attachment to the agreement we determined the quantitative and  qualitative indicators embracing all aspects of the hospital's  diverse activity. Attainment of these indicators meant full  financing of the hospital's work; when certain of them were not  met, penalties went into effect on the basis of mutual financial  settlements. Fulfillment of agreements between the hospital  administration and the individual services was organized in  similar fashion.    A system of monitoring treatment quality was developed; a  commission to summarize quarterly results of fulfilling the  agreement was approved by an order of the hospital's chief  physician.    Work under the agreements (the second stage of introducing  the new economic mechanism of management) with the departments  and services within the hospital made it possible in 1991 to  upgrade the quality and intensity of the work of the personnel,  to materially reinforce the personal responsibility of each  medical worker for the end results of both his own labor and the  labor of the entire department, and to do away with ``leveling''  of wages.    It must be emphasized that the Republic Clinical Hospital  fulfilled its agreed obligations completely on the basis of the  work results for 1991. Intensification of the work of the  services and of all associates made it possible to reduce the  average daily time of a patient's occupancy of a bed in the  hospital as a whole, as a result of which around an additional  6,000 patients received hospital care, which was over 25 percent  of the total number of hospitalized patients stipulated in the  agreement. The number of inhabitants of the republic's rayons in  the hospital was 60.7 percent (the planned indicator was 60  percent).    The work quality of the associates improved, and contracted  obligations were fulfilled and surpassed. This was reflected in  the hospital's financial activity. Under the new conditions of  management the hospital earned an additional 12.5 percent of  funds over what was planned by the budget. According to the  results for 1991, the wages of hospital associates generally  increased by an average of 40 percent in comparison with what  they received in March 1991. During 1991 the hospital also  provided medical services on the basis of direct contracts with  enterprises and institutions, as well as through health  insurance companies.    The second stage of introducing economic methods of  management ended with summarization of the results of fulfilling  the agreement on joint work by the Republic Clinical Hospital  and the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Tatarstan in 1991.  The results achieved by the Republic Clinical Hospital became an  object of business-like and incisive discussion at a meeting of  the board of the Republic of Tatarstan Ministry of Health on 26  February 1992, at which the principles of organizing our work  were approved. In courses organized by the training center,  directors of public health institutions in the republic's cities  and rayons, their deputies, economists, accountants and  department directors were acquainted with the system and  sequence of organizing the efforts of the Republic Clinical  Hospital to prepare for and accomplish the transition to  economic methods of management.    The accumulated experience allowed us to account for issues  left unresolved in the preceding stages when we signed an  agreement with the Ministry of Health for 1992. Thus, the  clinical-statistical groups were reexamined, and consideration  was given in them to the particular features of the course and  nature of disease treatment and to presence of accompanying  illnesses and complications, which brought about the need for  differentiating the prices. Expert evaluation sheets were drawn  up for the purpose of evaluating the completeness of the set of  therapeutic measures and the quality of treatment rendered to  each patient. Use of these sheets will make it possible to carry  out three-stage control of quality and make an integral  evaluation of it. Thus we have been in the third stage of the  work since the beginning of 1992--introducing the contract form  of labor organization and wages for the hospital administration  and department directors.    The preliminary results of using the new economic methods of  management in the Republic Clinical Hospital were as follows:  The attitude toward patients changed--the patient became a  desired guest in the minds of the hospital, the physicians and  all medical personnel; in addition interest appeared in curing a  larger number of patients with better quality of treatment. And  it is the latter that determines the wages received both in the  different structural subdivisions of the hospital and by  individual associates for the real results of their concrete  work.</p>

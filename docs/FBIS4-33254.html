			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Cristina Alves Emarion Monteiro: "No Buyers for </F> Caraiba and Cobra"]    [Text] The official auctioneer for the Rio de Janeiro Stock  Exchange, Danilo Ferreira, did not have much to do yesterday  when he started the bidding to sell the Caraiba Mining Company,  a copper producer, and Cobra Computers, a firm controlled by the  Bank of Brazil. As had been expected even by the representatives  of the government's privatization commission, the two auctions  failed for lack of interest.    Commission President Andre Montoro Filho has announced that  the process of privatizing those two firms will be reevaluated  next Monday. He will wait for the conclusion of negotiations  between employees of the mining company and the Arbi Group's  Caraiba Metals firm, the largest buyer of copper from the mining  company. "Depending on the results of those talks, we may  schedule another auction within 30 or 40 days," he says.    The Caraiba Mining Company, whose head office is in Bahia,  was being offered at a minimum price of $5.2 million, with the  purchaser also being required to pay a fine of $3 million if he  decided to shut down the company mine in less than five years.    Cobra -- The commission will also examine a few alternatives  with the Bank of Brazil for privatizing Cobra Computers, which  has now been put up for auction at the Rio de Janeiro Stock  Exchange for the second time without attracting a buyer. The  minimum price was set at $12 million. The firm owes the Bank of  Brazil $10 million in addition to its $11.2 million in labor  debts. Montoro Filho has said that the government-owned firm  will be liquidated only as a last resort and that before that  happens, the possibility of incorporating it into the Bank of  Brazil itself will be examined.    Braz Magno da Silva, who represents the employees, has  announced that he has obtained approval from the institution  itself to negotiate the purchase of the firm.

One of the difficulties in selling those firms is their high  level of indebtedness. To take control of Lloyd, for example, a  buyer will have to cope with a debt exceeding $100 million.  Another auction to try to sell Lloyd is scheduled for 11 May.    The firms in question are viewed by the financial market as  the program's real wallflowers. According to some analysts, what  future buyers really want is the ability to earn a return on  their investment -- that is, firms that will show a profit in  the future. What happens in the case of firms with little to  commend them is that the government often prefers to give them  one last chance before liquidating them, since liquidation  entails social problems.    But the thing that is behind these successive failures is  the  sluggishness of the privatization process. Consultants and  executives in the financial market complain that since taking  office in October 1992, President Itamar Franco has not added  any names to the list of government-owned firms to be sold. All  the privatizations taking place in recent months have involved  government-owned firms whose sale was already scheduled by the  Collor administration.    Delay -- The director of the Trevisan and Associates  consulting firm, Joao Antonio Lopes, recalls that since the PQU  (Union Petrochemicals) was sold in January of this year, there  have been no more auctions of important firms. The market also  suspects that the sale of Embraer [Brazilian Aeronautics  Company] on the 20th of this month may be postponed.    "There is a very big delay in establishing the direction the  program will take. Moreover, there is no interest in buying  firms that are in debt or technologically backward," says Joao  Antonio.    Luiz Chrysostomo de Oliveira, former superintendent of  privatization at the BNDES [National Economic and Social  Development Bank], feels, however, that the failure of the last  two auctions has not jeopardized the privatization program. What  may stall the process is the administration's lack of a clear  political will to sell government-owned firms.    Chrysostomo also observed that another factor is Congress'  retreat from voting on economic topics in connection with  constitutional revision.    "Failure to approve the law on the concession of public  utilities, the greater flexibility of the telecommunications and  petroleum monopolies, and the electric power industry may harm  the privatizations," Chrysostomo said.    Ricardo Fernandez, director of the BFC [expansion not given]  Bank, says the market is worried about the continuity of the  privatization process.    "The government recently managed to sell Arafertil. The  reason it was unable to auction off the two firms yesterday was  that they really do not interest anyone. Cobra, for example,  lags far behind in technology, and Lloyd has a lot of debts. The  firms constituting the `filet mignon' of the privatization  process are yet to come," says Fernandez.  <H5>  Program Losing Speed </H5>   The privatization program, which began under the Sarney  administration and picked up speed during the Collor era, was  established to reduce the state's presence in the economy and  provide an opportunity for more investment in the fields of  health, education, and infrastructure. Many of the firms had  been privately owned at one time but were later absorbed by the  government through the BNDES to prevent their liquidation. The  bank was a sort of first-aid clinic for the firms. That was the  case with Caraiba Metals and Mafersa, for example.    During the Sarney era, the man in charge of many of those  privatizations was engineer Marcio Fortes. In the Collor era, it  was the turn of economist Eduardo Modiano, another former  president of the BNDES. The privatization of such firms as  Usiminas (1991) and the CSN (1993) was marked by court  injunctions and protests in the streets by workers. Those  protests were seen abroad in pictures of street riots carried by  the world's principal TV networks.    Then came a decline. Since President Itamar took office,  only  14 government-owned firms have been sold: three were fertilizer  manufacturers, three were steel companies, and the others were  in the petrochemical industry. But all of them were already  included in the PND (National Privatization Program) inherited  from the Collor era. Itamar has not added any new firms to the  list.    The criticism most frequently heard from businessmen,  consultants, and bankers is that the process is moving ahead  much more slowly under the Itamar administration. There are  those on the economic team itself who claim that the resistance  is coming much more from Planalto Palace than from the left-wing  parties. One of the "stars" on that team recently went so far as  to say that the "Juiz de Fora gang" was not committed to moving  ahead with the program. The problem is that to improve the  government's cash situation, it is reportedly essential to have  the money from the sale of government-owned firms, which can  contribute to investments and, chiefly, help pay off the  national debt.</p>

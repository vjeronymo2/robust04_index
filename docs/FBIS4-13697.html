			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "Saddam's Insane Actions as He </F> Nears the End"]    [Excerpts] Iraqi President Saddam Husayn is nearing the  end of his rule and this is linked directly to the West's  support for his opponents. Despite their promises, the Western  countries refrained -- overtly and disastrously -- from  supporting the uprising of the deprived people against Saddam,  thus thwarting its success. If the opponents of the Iraqi  regime were to seriously help them, Saddam's downfall would be  very near.    Commenting on the 'Id al-Fitr address by Saddam Husayn on  Iraqi television, GUARDIAN correspondent David Hearst wrote that  Saddam showed clear signs of weakness and exhaustion which,  according to one of Saddam's advisers, had never been perceived  before. This unnamed high-level adviser who has joined the  enemy camp expressed concern that since Saddam can now see the  end of his tenure approaching, he may well do something insane  like his attack on Iran or the occupation of Kuwait.    Saddam's demented and heretical actions and his sense of the  approaching end of his power may motivate him to attack the  Kurd-inhabited safe havens in the north, the oil-rich southern  areas of Kuwait, or even sensitive regions, including Saudi  territory.    The first scenario would not prove very beneficial for him,  because of the aerial and military protection by the Western  countries for the Kurd-inhabited areas. In the event he attacks  the southern areas, it is possible that he could use them as a  lever to gain concessions from the Arab countries of the region,  Kuwait in particular. [passage omitted]    Saddam's personal health and poor morale aside, David Hearst  believes that the UN embargoes against Iraq have undermined the  administrative and political setup more than the financial and  economic sectors, which will eventually result in this country's  foundations degenerating from within. Saddam Husayn referred to  the economic embargoes more than any other issue in his 'Id  al-Fitr address.    Saddam had hoped to forge better relations once Clinton was  in power, considering his hostility to former U.S. President  George Bush. He also hoped to gain U.S. consent for the  economic sanctions to be reduced. He has failed in this and has  been forced to look to Russia, the PRC, and France for trade and  investments.    As a result of the current economic pressure the exchange  rate of the Iraqi dinar, which is officially three dinars to the  dollar, rose from 80 dinars to the dollar in the open market  last year to the present 350-to-one. Even the newspaper BABIL,  which is run by Saddam's son 'Udayy, has predicted that soon the  dollar will rise to 500 dinars.    On the other hand, more than $7.540 billion is being spent  by  the Iraqi government for essential goods and foodstuffs for the  people, and then doled out in meager rations. Iraq gets $1.25  billion per annum from illegal and covert exports, which it uses  mainly to buy weapons and advanced military equipment. It is  said that Iraq has built up its military capability to 80  percent of what it was before the occupation of Kuwait.    In his report, David Hearst concludes that if the city of  al-Basrah were to be transformed into a safe haven similar to  the Kurdish-inhabited areas in northern Iraq, Saddam's rule  would end much sooner. Referring to the deployment of the  Presidential Guard to the southern areas of Iraq, Hearst  predicts that an attack on the south and the Persian Gulf region  is a possibility which Saddam might insanely embark upon as his  regime approaches its end.</p>

			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / The Week Ahead: Results Due BET, the business services group in the latter stages of a three-year restructuring, is expected to report interim pre-tax profits of about Pounds 48m on Monday. Now that the group is better managed, cash is being generated and its balance sheet is under control, investors will focus on whether BET has yet formulated a plan that will inject some more excitement into its portfolio of businesses. Wellcome, the pharmaceuticals group, reports full-year results on Thursday. Analysts expect pre-tax profits to come in at between Pounds 640m and Pounds 690m, compared with Pounds 504m last year. The company will benefit substantially from favourable exchange rates, so attention will be focused on underlying sales growth. Of particular interest will be the progress of Zovirax, the shingles and herpes treatment that is Wellcome's best-selling medicine. Imperial Chemical Industries, the UK's largest chemical group, reports its third-quarter results on Thursday. The group is expected to report pre-tax profits of between Pounds 55m and Pounds 70m during a difficult three months. Demand on the continent was slow during August, and recovery in the UK and US has been hesitant.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Caracas, 1 May (EFE) -- Antonio Casas Gonzalez, who  was appointed new president of Banco Central of Venezuela (BCV),  took office today, Sunday, and called an urgent meeting of the  bank's board of directors.    Casas Gonzalez was appointed BCV president after the  unexpected 26 April resignation of Ruth de Krivoy, who held that  post for the past two years.    Krivoy resigned alleging deep differences with the way the  government had handled the delicate financial crisis in  mid-January when Banco Latino, the country's second most  important one at the time, was intervened.    After the Latino Bank crisis, an additional eight banks had  to receive assistance of the state, which diverted almost 5  billion [currency unspecified] in financial aid to prevent a  massive bankruptcy of banks.    During the past weeks President Rafael Caldera assigned  Gustavo Roosen, intervener of Banco Latino, to design a plan  that will restore confidence in the financial system and lower  the ceiling on interest rates, which is over 60 percent.    This decision by Caldera and other decisions by Roosen to  carry out the assigned task were viewed by Krivoy as state  interference in monetary policy affairs, which Venezuelan laws  reserve for the BCV and, therefore, shows a lack of respect for  the bank's autonomy.    After learning of Krivoy's resignation, the government and  Senate agreed to appoint Casas Gonzalez, who up until that time  had represented the state-owned Venezuelan Petroleum before the  British Government and other European countries.    Following Krivoy's resignation, the local stock market got  out of control "completely, and the Venezuelan bolivar suffered"  a heavy devaluation compared to the U.S. dollar. This will be  the first problem the new BCV authorities will resolve.    Economists Domingo Maza Zavala and Miguel Ignacio Purroy and  Casas Gonzalez were sworn in as new BCV directors.    Casas Gonzalez, an economist, was deputy minister of  development between 1969 and 1972 and planning minister between  1972 and 1974, both times under the Caldera administration. The  Senate unanimously supported his appointment as BCV president.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS free-lance correspondent Semen Ivanov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 13 Jan--The impact of rocket launches into  space is most marked in the fall zones for the residue of spent  carrier rockets. At present, 18.8 million hectares of land in  the territory of four CIS states (Russia, Kazakhstan,  Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan) are employed as fall zones, and  the Plesetsk cosmodrome uses almost half of this--9 million  hectares of Russian land--for this purpose.    The Ecos program to improve the ecological situation in the  fall zones, which involves the cleanup of fallen spent rocket  elements, a decrease of rocket fuel remnants from spent  carrier-rocket stages, and a reduction in the amount and size of  fall zones, is at present being implemented using Russian  Defense Ministry funds.    The largest fall zone area--in Archangel oblast--is 3.5  million hectares (almost 6 percent of the oblast's total area).  Ecological cleanup subunits begin their field season there  every July. The servicemen gather into containers the fragments  of carrier-rocket stages, which are then taken to storage depots.    Almost 4.5 million hectares of land in Russia is used as  fall  zones for the spent parts of carrier-rockets launched from the  Baykonur cosmodrome, over half of this land being located in  Tomsk Oblast (about 2 million hectares) and Novosibirsk Oblast  (almost 1 million hectares).    In 1993, the fall zone areas for the first stages of the  R-7A  family of carrier-rockets (``Soyuz'' and ``Molniya'') were  reduced by 10 percent. This process is continuing. About  500,000 hectares will be returned to users in Tomsk and  Novosibirsk Oblasts because seven fall zones have ceased to be  used. In this connection, specialists emphasize that the  problem of reducing fall zone areas can be radically tackled  only if one employs the controlled descent of spent  carrier-rocket elements on aerodynamic structures that can be  unfurled such as parachutes, paragliders, and air balloons.  However the Russians have no money to fund this work. The  Russian Federation Parachute-Building Research Institute has had  to develop a gliding parachute, although it was indeed for the  French Ariane-5 carrier-rocket.</p>

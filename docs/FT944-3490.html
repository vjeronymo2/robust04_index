			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Highest and lowest Sir, Frank Blackaby (Letters: December 7) asks what the ratio between the highest and lowest paid members of a company should be. It may be of interest to know that in 1915 Admiral Jellicoe, who was described as the one person who could lose the war in an afternoon, was paid Pounds 1,825 a year, while an Ordinary Seaman earned Pounds 12 3s (Pounds 12.15) a year - a ratio of 1:150. By 1917, the ratio had dropped to 1:105. David J. Critchley 46 Station Road, Winslow, Buckingham, MK18 3EH</p>

			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / World Trade News: UK in investment accord with Cuba Britain has signalled strong official encouragement for UK businesses to invest in Cuba with an investment promotion and protection agreement. The agreement was initialled on Wednesday by Britain's trade and technology minister, Mr Ian Taylor. Mr Taylor yesterday referred to Cuba as 'a very exciting market' at the end of a three-day visit, the first by a British minister to the island in almost 20 years. 'Clearly, the potential here is very considerable,' Mr Taylor said. 'The agreement will give confidence that Cuba is a market with which British businesses can deal.' He had led a British business delegation in talks on investment opportunities in air transport, construction, Cuba's sugar sector and insurance. Mr Taylor, clearly distancing British government policy from the US trade and financial embargo against the island, underlined the fact that Britain had never cut its trade links with Cuba. British exports for the first half of this year were up 180 per cent over last year. The 1993 export total was Pounds 14m, which was 50 per cent down from 1992. But he said many British companies had found it difficult to do business in the past because of Cuba's centrally-managed and highly regulated state economy. Cuba was moving to reform its economy to adapt to world trading conditions after the collapse of the Soviet Union, its main trading partner. 'I made it clear that British companies would find dealing with Cuba easier the further the reform process goes,' said Mr Taylor, who had talks with President Fidel Castro. He said that while Cuban reforms were at an early stage, he was assured by Mr Castro they would continue. He noted that British companies were already operating in Cuba in oil exploration and oil services, agrochemicals, lubricants, soap and detergent manufacture, citrus, financial services and the sugar industry.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tirana, April 12 (AFP) -- More than 30,000  Albanians turned out Monday for the funerals of two soldiers  killed, according to authorities in an attack on their training  camp by "Greek terrorists" backing autonomy for Albania's ethnic  Greeks.    About 10,000 mourners in the southern town of Gjirokaster  massed outside the Greek consulate in protest at the reported  attack near Peshkopia early Sunday. Another 20,000 attended the  second funeral in Siera.    Defence Minister Safet Zhulali attended the funeral in  Gjirokastra and in a speech hit out at "the Greek Government and  the Greek church... conspiring behind our backs".    He said Greece which has expressed fears for the safety of  the Greek minority in southern Albania "bears full  responsibility for these acts which will be punished if they are  repeated".    Albanian officials said officer Fatmir Shehu of Gjirokaster  and conscript Arsen Gjini of Siera were killed and several other  soldiers wounded when a Greek commando crossed the border at  night and attacked the training camp. The Greeks allegedly  opened fire on the sleeping soldiers.    Zhulali dismissed Greek calls for incorporation into Greece  of the Greek-populated area of southern Albania which Athens  refers to as Northern Epirus. "Northern Epirus does not exist  and never existed," he said.    The Albanian Government, in a communique Monday, said  Sunday's attack was a "direct attack on Albanian sovereignty and  territorial integrity". Albania reserved the right to "take all  necessary steps to respond to this policy of provocation", the  statement said.</p>

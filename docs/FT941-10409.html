			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Australian producer cuts iron ore price Hamersley Iron, the big Australian iron ore producer yesterday announced that it would cut iron ore price by an average of 7.6 per cent, following the annual round of negotiations with the Japanese steel mills. Hamersley, part of the CRA group, said that the price of lump ore would decline by 5.9 per cent to 33.26 US cents a dry long ton unit, while the price of fine ore would fall by 9.5 per cent, to 25.66 cents. This gives a weighted average decrease of 7.6 per cent. The minimum volume to be delivered has been set at 19m tonnes - the same as last year. This is the third successive year of price cuts. At the beginning of 1993, the price of fine ore fell by 11 per cent, and lump, by 9 per cent. Hamersley admitted that the negotiations had been 'unusually complex and lengthy', and stressed that 'agreement should be seen in the context of the parlous state of the Japanese economy'. 'The combined losses of the Japanese mills will exceed Y240bn this year and they are forecasting further reductions in steel production and iron ore demand next year. Furthermore, the fact that suppliers of other raw materials have already granted significant price decreases only serves to raise buyers' expectations', said Mr Roddy Kinkead-Weekes, Hamersley's managing director for sales and marketing. The last comment was a reference to the recently-announced coal price contracts with the Japanese mills, which saw Australian producers take price cuts of up to 9.5 per cent. Hamersley described the iron ore deal as 'mutually satisfactory' under the circumstances - a view generally shared by analysts, and CRA shares rose 38 cents to ADollars 19.26.</p>

			<p><P> July 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE MATURE TRAVELER: WAIKIKI HOTEL DISCOUNTS  </P> <P> The welcome mat is out in Honolulu's Waikiki resort area, where the tourism  boom continues.  </P> <P> Although many travelers deplore the commercialism and overbuilding that all but  obscures the 1 1/2-mile stretch of white sandy beach and the calm blue waters  of the Pacific Ocean, Kalakaua Avenue -- the heart of Waikiki -- continues to  draw record crowds.  </P> <P> With a mild, constant temperature and little need for jackets or neckties, plus  dozens of sightseeing attractions and a great selection of water sports,  Waikiki has enhanced its appeal with an increasing number of concessions  designed to attract mature travelers.  </P> <P> The largest hotel group in Honolulu, Outrigger Hotels Hawaii, is offering  senior rates to anyone over 50, proof of which must be provided upon check-in.  For more information, call toll-free (800) 367-5170.  </P> <P> The newly refurbished Hilton Hawaiian Village is Hawaii's largest hotel, with  more than 2,500 rooms. The hotel's shopping village provides discounts up to  50% under its Senior Honors program, which brings rates in three of the four  towers down to $100 a night and $150 in the exclusive Ali'i Tower.  </P> <P> At the Hilton, meal discounts of 20% are offered at the Don Ho Dinner Show,  Catamaran Sunset Dinner Sail and Rainbow Hawaiian Fare Buffet. Call Hilton at  (800) 445-8667.  </P> <P> The Sheraton group of hotels, which includes the Sheraton Waikiki, the  venerable Ala Moana, the Royal Hawaiian and the Princess Kaiualini, offer the  systemwide 25% discount for seniors. Call (800) 325-3535.  </P> <P> Other nationwide chains with hotels in Waikiki that offer senior discounts  include Best Western, Colony, Days Inns, Quality Inns and Ramada.  </P> <P> Some hotels provide only a limited number of rooms for senior discounts, and  certain holiday periods may be restricted. Minimum age limits vary, and  reservations are always on a space-available basis. Proof of age may be a  driver's license, passport or membership in a recognized senior organization  such as AARP.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Low Flight Rates  </P> <P> Discounts for travelers over 65 are also offered on the two inter-island  airlines, Aloha and Hawaiian airlines. Both offer a $10 discount off the  regular $49.95 fare between any of the Hawaiian islands.  </P> <P> A Sunrise Special, not limited to seniors, provides for an even less expensive  fare of $29.95 for the first and last flights of the day from Honolulu Airport  to any neighboring island.  </P> <P> There's a simple way for the mature traveler to find restaurants that offer  senior discounts. Such restaurants are marked in the Honolulu phone book Yellow  Pages with a star symbol. Many of these restaurants are branches of major U.S.  chains, such as Denny's, Burger King and Sizzler steak houses. Amount of  discount and age limits vary.  </P> <P> During certain hours the Jolly Roger gives patrons over 60 years 20% off.  Burger King offers 10% off for those over 55, while Denny's and Sizzler have  special senior menus. Some independent restaurants offer discounts on lunch or  dinner only.  </P> <P> Many movie theaters in Honolulu offer special rates of $3 for seniors over age  65 at any time of day or evening and on holidays. Some sightseeing attractions  and sports-equipment rental outlets offer senior discounts. Free tourist  publications with ample information on what to do and see in Honolulu are in  the city's new display racks.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Charge on Buses  </P> <P> One of the biggest bargains for seniors in Honolulu is the E&amp;H (Elderly and  Handicapped) BusCard, which permits the holder unlimited transportation on the  city bus line, MTL.  </P> <P> Known locally as The Bus, the network of routes serves the entire island of  Oahu. The pass is valid on any line at any time of day or night, without  restrictions. And the price is right -- it is issued to anyone over age 65 at  no charge.  </P> <P> Apply at the MTL headquarters with a passport, birth certificate or valid  driver's license from any state, and you'll be photographed and presented with  a laminated plastic identification card that's valid until the end of the year.  </P> <P> For more information on the Waikiki area, write to Waikiki Beach Operators  Assn., 820 Mililani St., No. 400-K, Honolulu, Hawaii 96813. For information on  obtaining the free E&amp;H BusCard, in Honolulu call (808) 531-0431.  </P> <P>  -- -- --  </P> <P> The off-season in the Soviet Union -- fall, winter and spring -- is also its  cultural season. During that period, prices are lower and groups are smaller.  Tourists have gone. Love Holidays/Uniworld Tours, which has been providing  travel for mature travelers for many years, has created several packages for  the 1989-1990 season in conjunction with Finnair, the national airline of  Finland.  </P> <P> Four itineraries are offered that cover from eight to 11 days, with departure  dates from November until next April. Prices begin at $1,268 and include  round-trip air transportation from West Coast cities, all transport within the  Soviet Union, deluxe and first-class hotels, plus three meals daily.  </P> <P> In Moscow you get a theater performance and visits to the Kremlin and Red  Square. In Leningrad the Hermitage Museum is visited. All four tours include  Leningrad and Moscow and one or two additional cities, depending on the  itinerary selected.  </P> <P> A color brochure that gives complete details, including prices, components and  itineraries, is available from Love Holidays/Uniworld, 15315 Magnolia Blvd.,  Sherman Oaks 91403, or call (800) HLO-LOVE (456-5683), (213) 873-7991 or (818)  501-6868.  </P></p>

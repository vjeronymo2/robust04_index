			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / CIA chief rebuts allegations over 'mole': Woolsey's handling of spy scandal raises doubts over his leadership Mr James Woolsey, head of the CIA, yesterday rebutted charges that disciplinary action he had taken in the wake of the Aldrich Ames affair was grossly inadequate, writes Jurek Martin in Washington. Ames is a confessed 'mole' for the former Soviet Union whose action, a CIA report has confirmed, undermined at least 55, and possibly more, US covert operations in the mid-1980s. Ten US agents - all citizens of the Soviet Union - were executed. In a sharp TV exchange with Senator Dennis DeConcini, the Republican from Arizona and a leading critic of the CIA, Mr Woolsey said letters of reprimand sent to 11 present and former officials did not constitute 'business as usual'. Mr DeConcini conceded there was little Mr Woolsey could do about the seven retired CIA employees found negligent in their supervision of Ames. But, the senator went on, 'some of them are still there, running (espionage) operat-ions. And what do they get? They get a letter. Now I don't want somebody's scalp or something. What I want is change out there.' Mr Woolsey testified later to a secret session of the Senate intelligence committee. But, in several interviews, he was adamant he had gone through each case 'individually and fairly, acting somewhat like a judge'. He had no apologies for retaining Mr Hugh 'Ted' Price as deputy director of operations, even though he was one of the serving officers receiving a letter of reprimand. Mr Woolsey said Mr Price had only been tangentially involved for a short period and was critical to efforts to reform the agency. But he also said a junior CIA official who had tried unsuccessfully to bring Ames's activities to the attention of superiors was being commended and promoted to serve as his own special assistant. Even though Ames did his damage before Mr Woolsey took over the CIA with the onset of the Clinton administration, his handling of the matter has raised questions in Washington about his own position. In an interview on Wednesday he said he had no intention of stepping down, merely observing that 'some days are longer than others'.</p>

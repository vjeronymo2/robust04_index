			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Do Not Bank on Recovery of U.S. Economy"] </F>   [Text] The Japan-U.S. summit talks are scheduled to open  in Washington this weekend. As usual, the biggest topic is how  to reduce Japan's trade surplus, which recently reached a record  high of $140 billion.    However, while Japan-U.S. economic frictions have been  discussed under a hypothesis that "The Japanese economy is  stronger than that of the United States," the framework has  completely changed since the Clinton administration's  inauguration.    Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa will certainly be surprised  if he actually sees a sudden recovery of the U.S. economy, since  Japan has not yet found a way out of the prolonged recession.    An economic expansion of the United States economy is good  news for the Japanese economy. Generally speaking, the yen  becomes cheaper against the dollar when the U.S. economy becomes  strong. Expanded output by U.S. industries brings about  increased machine and part exports from Japan to the United  States. Since the exporting industries of Japan have been  suffering from the rapid appreciation of the yen rates, they may  be given a break.    Of course, the U.S. economy has not yet become strong enough  to allow Japan's economic recovery through boosted exports to  the United States. On the other hand, Japanese industries'  competitive power is currently too weak to resume violent  exports to the United States.    Japan must accelerate its efforts to revitalize its economy  by stimulating domestic consumption. At the same time, it is  about time Japan dealt with the United States as an equal  partner, overcoming its passive manners in bilateral  negotiations.    In the last quarter of 1993, the real growth rate of the  U.S.  economy reached 5.9 percent. This demonstrated the United  States is really heading for economic recovery. After the  enactment of legislation for reducing fiscal deficits, private  consumption and capital investments were triggered by a rapid  decline in long-term market interest rates.    According to U.S. President Bill Clinton's budget message to  the Congress, the federal government's fiscal deficits in fiscal  year 1995 (from October 1994 to September 1995) will drop to  $170 billion. If the figure remains below $200 billion, it will  be the lowest in the last six years.    The reduction of fiscal deficits is a result of the budget  cut and tax hike policies. Lowered interest rates and economic  recovery are also positive factors in the sense that these bring  about a reduction of interest payments on national bonds and an  increase in tax revenues.    Yet, we cannot be too optimistic about the future of the  U.S.  economy. The government's belt-tightening policy is a negative  factor for further economic expansion. If the Congress rejects  the government's medical insurance reform plan, long-term  interest rates will rapidly pick up in anticipation of fiscal  deficit growth.    It is also uncertain how long personal consumption will  remain brisk in the United States because individual consumption  is already growing faster than people's income. Increased job  opportunities are primarily for temporary employees of  restaurants and other service industries, rather than permanent  employees in manufacturing industries. The expansion of  individual consumption will be limited when the economic  recovery does not raise workers' earnings.    It is not very easy to maintain high levels of economic  growth through the domestic market's expansion when the nation  is working on reducing fiscal deficits. So, the Clinton  administration has an economic strategy to expand exports to  boost the economy. This is why the United States is strongly  urging Japan to open its markets and expand domestic consumption.    Prime Minister Hosokawa is going to attend the summit with  the new pump-priming package as a souvenir. At that time, the  prime minister should not let the United States entertain too  many expectations about effects from the pump-priming package  because it cannot boost the Japanese economy or reduce Japan's  trade surplus immediately.    The prime minister should candidly explain the fact that the  government has very limited control over the economy. The  private sector's self-help effort is an indispensable condition  for overcoming the recession. Also, U.S. exports to Japan  cannot be increased without efforts by U.S. companies. If Japan  accepts U.S. demands for setting numerical targets for  increasing imports from the United States, it will only result  in a reinforcement of governmental restrictions over business  activities.    The foundation for international policy coordination is  sincerely seeking steady growth of one's own economy, not  criticizing each other. We hope the two leaders reconfirm this  point at the summit.</p>

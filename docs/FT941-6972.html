			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / Travel: A perfect Caribbean meal Surely the ideal setting for a Caribbean restaurant is a palm-thatched hut on the waterfront, with a perfect view over the beach to a turquoise sea. This would be an ideal place to pass the heat of the afternoon. But this is to forget that so many places in the tropics are more atmospheric at night. One of the finest settings of any restaurant in the Caribbean is that of Anacoana on the island of Providenciales in the Turks and Caicos Islands. By day, the view takes in the surreal blue Caicos sea, with the deep ocean in the distance marked clearly by a line of breaking waves and a darker blue, but the restaurant really comes into its own after dark. Anacoana stands just above the miles and miles of sand of Grace Bay, next to the Grace Bay Club. You dine under palm thatch where tables are laid out in three palapas, open-sided huts with pointed roofs like American-Indian straw houses. But the roofs are supported on a circle of classical columns and so the feel is part straw hut, part temple. The evening breeze, chopped and chased by the ceiling fans, finds its own path among the tables. In front of the palapas are ranged a number of parasols where other tables stand beside the tropical greenery. Looking towards the darkness, the palm trees are floodlit and the smoke from flaming torches plays in the glare; beneath them, tall strands of guinea grass are etched yellow against the black of the night. The chef is a young Canadian, Stuart Gray, who trained in Canada and then in Britain, working all the time with French chefs. His cuisine is eclectic, he says. He borrows flavours and ideas wherever he travels, and these have found their way into the menu at Anacoana - the fillet of salmon is flavoured with ginger and lime butter and the lobster-tail with saffron. But Gray can also turn his hand to a very fine filet of steak in a rich red wine and mustard sauce. Most important, all his food is fresh, which is often a problem in the Caribbean. But the Turks and Caicos are close enough to Miami to get the best meats on a regular basis. Gray makes the most of Caribbean ingredients, including local lobsters, grouper and snapper, smoking some of them for variety. His desserts are excellent, too, and meals are rounded off with home-made truffles. If food has traditionally been a problem in the Caribbean, there are more and more passable restaurants opening. They are pretty expensive, but they are an important holiday ingredient. Service can be a little haphazard, but this ought not to be a severe problem when you are adjusting to island time, anyway, and are in a wonderful setting.

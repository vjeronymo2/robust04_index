			<p>BFN     [Text] The second congress of the Socialist Party of Labor  [PSM], which concluded in Bucharest on 10 April, reelected Ilie  Verdet to the position of president of this political formation.  The Steering Council of the party also includes the following  members: Adrian Paunescu, first deputy president, and Tudor  Mohora, Traian Dudas, Maria Lazar, Nicolae Ontanu, Mihai  Paraluta, and Ion Sasu, vice presidents.    The congress adopted two motions. One proposes that the  parliament adopt a law on the need for the state to grant  compensation to former owners and to grant tenants the right to  purchase flats that they currently occupy. The second motion  asks all bodies of the current leadership to free all political  detainees, that is, deputy members of the Executive Political  Committee of the former Romanian Communist Party and to  eliminate all forms of instigation to hatred, revenge, and  extremism.    In his statement to Bucharest Radio station, party President  Ilie Verdet affirmed that the proposed objectives have been  achieved and, as far as the election of the new leadership  bodies of the party are concerned, the goal was to renew them by  admitting younger people to the ranks of the party. One can  state, said Ilie Verdet in conclusion, that the PSM is a new and  democratic party, suitable for entering the competition for  ruling.</p>

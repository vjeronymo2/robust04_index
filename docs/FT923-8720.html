			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / Management: Starting all over again - The army of unemployed American executives seeking new careers as consultants For many, it was living the American dream. They had a management job with a top US company, good pay and benefits, a house in the suburbs, two cars and a sense of security. But for many of these executives, the American dream has turned to a nightmare during the recession. Hundreds of thousands of middle- and upper-level executives have found themselves out on the street and discovered that they have little chance of finding their way back to similar positions. From January 1989 to June this year, 1.2m jobs have been eliminated by leading American corporations. Some 70 per cent of those cuts have come not in assembly line jobs, but in management, engineering and administration, according to Dan Lacey, editor of 'Workplace Trends', a newsletter that tracks firings. 'It's a dramatic and traumatic thing that's going on out there,' says Lacey. What is worse for many sacked executives is that they face a shrunken market for their skills, as lay-offs have affected whole industries. Among the hardest hit have been the computer, motor, aerospace and defence industries. Redundancies are part of how American companies are grappling with tougher international competition, says Stephen Carter, manager of the Kansas City office of Right Associates, the world's leading publicly-held outplacement company. The litany of lay-offs by American corporate icons, such IBM, AT&amp;T, Alcoa and GM, seems endless. In the last 12 years, 5m jobs have been pared by the Fortune 500 and the contraction shows no sign of let up. Paul Foask, managing director in Chicago of Korn/Ferry International, the largest US executive recruitment firm, says: 'I don't have the salesman's optimism that things are going to get any better.' The situation is new to American executives. This is the first recession in which white collar employees are bearing the brunt of unemployment, says Richard Belous, economist with the National Planning Society, a Washington-based public policy group. 'In the last two recessions, in 1982 and 1975, white collar unemployment was roughly 20-33 per cent of the total. Now, it's up to 59 per cent.' Moreover, long-term unemployment, little known to the white collar brigade, is becoming increasingly common. While managers used to be able to find a new position in a month, six months is now a minimum and many wait a year or more. Some are even falling out of the labour market altogether. 'What makes it bad is people feel they've been mislead. Generally, there's a great feeling of bitterness,' says Jack Hackman, who lost his job two years ago as art department chief in Chicago for NBC, the broadcasting group. Many of those laid off feel that their hard work and loyalty have largely not been rewarded, puncturing one of corporate America's sturdiest myths. But Hackman has taken the path that increasing numbers of unemployed executives are choosing. He has become a consultant. He now does design work for restaurants, hotels and performing arts groups. Job market experts believe that 15-20 per cent of redundant managers become consultants. Only a tiny percentage turn to franchising, creating their own company or acquiring an existing one, because all these options require start-up capital. New consultants frequently begin by returning to perform subcontracting services for their old employers. A 1989 study by the National Planning Association showed that about half of those laid off were taken back on consultancy work. For some, the former employer becomes the prime client for as much as two years, says John Poynton, a partner of the Chicago outplacement company, Clarke Poynton Associates. Many companies are finding that they can farm out work that was once done in-house at a considerably lower cost. Indeed, as healthcare benefit costs have soared, companies have struggled to employ outsiders rather than staff wherever possible. If those outsiders have worked for the company, so much the better. Yet, while there is more work for consultants, their growing numbers means competition is fierce. For most, it is an insecure business. While a consultant works on one job it is difficult to spend time hunting for others to keep the diary full. And employers can pull work away on a whim. To reduce their sense of isolation and uncertainty, many consultants join professional associations, says Tom Germuska, who lost his public relations job after 19 years with United Airlines. He is now president of the Midwest Society for Professional Consultants. About half of those who attempt consulting fail simply because they do not have the temperament, says Glenn Van Doren, president of the Association of Executive Search Consultants. Like other entrepreneurial activities, consulting takes 'people skills', and many who have been ensconced in corporate management positions do not have those abilities, he says. Consulting has had such an influx of jobless executives during the last few years that it has almost become a code word for being unemployed. Many just put consulting on their CVs to fill in for a jobless period, though they have done little or no consulting work. These people generally return to regular jobs. But with the wealth of managerial talent on the street these days, most face having to take jobs below their previous levels of salary, benefits and responsibility. And even those willing to do so must be flexible enough to consider changing industries and acquiring new skills. The good news is that small- and medium-sized companies, traditionally the biggest generators of US jobs, are inheriting a vast pool of highly qualified managers to choose from. One study by Right Associates even found that executives who went to work for small- and medium-sized companies are finding greater satisfaction in shaping and building up their new companies, despite the lower pay.</p>

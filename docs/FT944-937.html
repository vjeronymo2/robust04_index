			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / Political interference in Hungarian privatisations angers foreign investors For foreign investors who hoped Hungary's new Socialist-led government would carry out its election pledge to speed up and clean up privatisation, the sale of HungarHotels, the last state hotel chain, has not been an auspicious start. First came political pressure to ignore an international tender and hand over the hotels chain to the cash-strapped social security fund. Then there were poorly-handled negotiations in which the top bidder was abruptly asked to raise its price by 15 per cent at the last moment after already outbidding its nearest rival by more than 20 per cent. Just when a deal was finally struck last week, the prime minister called an investigation into the sale. The investigation team is due to report by today. The controversial sale comes just as Hungary, the pioneer of market-led reforms in eastern Europe, is preparing to privatise several of its largest companies, including most of its energy sector. One banker said: 'This deal has been deeply disturbing. It makes me think we're in for a bumpy road with this government in the future. If they can't sell a hotel chain, will they part with their gas and electricity companies?' A much-publicised bill which will radically alter privatisation strategy and merge the State Property Agency (SPA) and the State Holding Company (SHC), the two main privatisation bodies, was due to be discussed by parliament this autumn. It is now unlikely to be passed before March. The uncertainty this has created has demoralised and weakened both institutions. Several key members of staff have left for more lucrative jobs in the private sector. Others, such as Mr Lajos Csepi, former head of the SHC, have been sacked. Advisers say quality has suffered and some of the privatisations under way are being poorly prepared. The privatisation of Gyortej, a dairy in Gyor in north-western Hungary, in which foreign investors lost out to local bidders backed by the ministry of agriculture, shows the pitfalls that await foreign bidders. After a competitive tender, the dairy was awarded to a consortium of the investment arm of Budapest City Council and 27 farming co-operatives from Fejer County. The decision was made against the advice of case officers in the agriculture ministry and the SPA and after the consortium was allowed to raise its price at the last moment without the foreign investors being offered the same option. The losing bidder for the dairy was Konzum, a listed Hungarian company owned by foreign institutional investors. Its bid also included the dairy's management and milk producers from the Gyor region. The two groups prepared their bids just as the new government was drawing up its privatisation strategy. This emphasised cash sales to strategic partners would be preferred over other forms of privatisation. It also pledged to provide more investment opportunities for holders of compensation coupons (CCs) which were issued to victims of the former communist regime. The coupons, which trade on the secondary market for less than half their official value, can be used in privatisations for the full nominal value. Konzum says senior SPA and ministry of agriculture officials told it a strong element of cash, as well as a good business plan and the inclusion of the management in its bid would help it win the tender. Therefore rather than offering a bid totally in CCs, it bid 38 per cent in cash and the rest in coupons. It also offered an immediate cash injection of Ft300m (Dollars 2.7m) for the dairy which is heavily indebted. The business plan was evaluated by the SPA at 11 out of 15. The winning consortium offered just CCs and a future Ft180m share offering which was less than the Ft200m capital increase stipulated in the tender documents. Its business plan scored 1 out of 15. This consortium won because, with CCs taken at nominal value, its bid for the 51 per cent stake was Ft655m. Konzum's bid was Ft527m. However, if Konzum had used its cash portion to buy CCs its offer would have been worth Ft756m. This led the case officer in the agriculture ministry to conclude the two offers 'cannot be compared realistically'. Given the many other factors in Konzum's favour, the case officer recommended it be awarded the dairy. This recommendation was overruled at a higher level in the ministry. Moreover, in the two days before a final decision was taken, the consortium was unilaterally allowed to raise its price to Ft755m even though this is against SPA internal rules. Konzum says it was not given the chance to alter its bid or raise its price. In explaining the move, Mr Erno Racz, an SPA deputy managing director, said the decision was taken for 'very important political reasons'. The government had to honour its pledge to allow CC holders to use the coupons at full value for good assets and the consortium had offered more in CC terms. Original holders of CCs should be preferred over the 'financial speculators' who bought them up on the secondary market. He said a capital increase via a share offering was preferable to Konzum's cash injection as a 'foreign investor could take its cash out of the company whenever it wanted'. Further, he said the privatisation authorities were under pressure to find local buyers for companies in the food industry and in Gyor county which borders Austria. He said Austrian companies, which have invested heavily in the region, had a 'dangerous influence' in the county. 'There have been questions in parliament demanding how we could let the whole food industry fall into the hands of foreigners,' he said. 'What was more important - to allow Hungarian co-operatives to win the tender or to get some millions of forints and generate a political storm in Hungary?' This last statement has led Konzum, which has spent more than Dollars 160,000 in advisers' fees on its bid, to ask why the tender was open to foreign investors. Mr Albert von Pappenheim, chairman, said: 'We expected more from the new government. We have not been treated fairly or legally. Why on earth should we invest more money in this country?'</p>

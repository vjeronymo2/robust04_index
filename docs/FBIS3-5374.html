This  is because Malaysia is not a GATT signatory on procurement,  which stipulates that a country opens its contracts to free  competition, he told newsmen after the presentation of prizes  for the sixth national furniture design competition here.    However, we have not slapped any trade sanction on Britain  and the private sectors of both countries are free to trade with  each other, he said in response to queries that a British firm  had stopped its order of furniture from Malaysia. Asked whether  this was a retaliation from the British company, he said, we are  not afraid ..... We are ready to face any consequences. .. It  looks like the British firm has succumbed to the emotional  effect of the patronising attitude of the British press. He said  Britain was only a small market as far as Malaysian commodities  were concerned, adding that efforts had always been underway to  diversify export markets of local products, meaning which the  action of the British firm was unlikely to have any impact.    Dr. Lim, however, said he was compiling the list of  commodities being sold with Britain which would be presented to  the cabinet if the need arose for information on commodities  traded with that country.    He also said that the action by the government showed  Malaysia's daring in questioning the values that the British  press has set, which are alien to us and which they insist we  uphold.</p>

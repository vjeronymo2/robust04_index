			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Management (Marketing &amp; Advertising): Ringing in change at the supermarket checkout - The days of clipping money-off coupons are over The use of coupons as a marketing tool has always been regarded as fine in theory; rather less than perfect in practice. The trouble is that they are fiddly, costly and imprecise, often hitting the wrong type of customer at the wrong time in the wrong place. Magazine advertisements containing coupons are widely regarded as offering a bluderbuss approach to marketing when more closely targeted methods are called for. A recent unseemly squabble among UK food retailers - when Tesco offered to redeem everyone else's coupons, prompting a spoiling campaign from its rivals - has also tarnished the coupon's image, even though that battle looks as though it is drawing to a close. But several retailers are now experimenting with better ways of issuing coupons. In September, Superdrug will install up to 10 'instant coupon machines' on the shelves of its top 160 drugstores, providing shoppers with the opportunity immediately to redeem promotional offers on various products. This is seen as a powerful means of influencing shoppers at the crucial moment of decision. Others retailers are exploring ways to utilise the mass of marketing knowledge that they gather from their electronic point of sale (Epos) equipment at their check-outs to produce electronic coupons. If successful, these systems could revolutionise the coupon industry, delivering a highly potent marketing weapon for both brand managers and retailers alike. Next month, Asda, the UK's fourth biggest grocery chain, is launching a trial of an electronic coupon system at five stores using technology licensed from Catalina Marketing, a nine-year-old US company which was floated on the New York Stock Exchange in March. The Coupon Saver system is a small machine next to each supermarket till which is linked into the store's Epos network and instantaneously monitors purchases. Bar-codes on specified products trigger the issue of coupons which are then handed to the shopper along with their bill. 'It is like having a brand manager standing at every customer's shoulder giving a coupon to all those people they want to attract,' says John Eustace, Catalina's UK licence holder. The beauty of the system, he suggests, is its flexibility. For example, brand managers can simply attempt to 'lock in' customers by issuing money-off coupons whenever their products are bought. Or a manufacturer can encourage a shopper to switch brands by issuing a coupon for their brand, whenever one of their rivals' products are scanned. Retailers can encourage return custom by issuing loyalty coupons for frequent shoppers or entice them to spend more by issuing coupons for bigger packs or multi- buys. Coupon Saver can also be used to support advertising campaigns or product launches. It can even be used in conjunction with a personalised store card to issue 'reminder' coupons to individual customers. For instance, a razor blade manufacturer whose products are on average bought every two months could issue a coupon to an individual shopper seven weeks after they made their last purchase, lessening the likelihood that they will lose it. Catalina pays for the installation of the machines and sells the 'rights' to issue coupons in about 400 different product categories to the retailer and various brand managers. It costs upwards of Pounds 10,000 to install the system in a store with 25 check-outs. Catalina's UK customers will initially be charged at a rate of about Pounds 75 for every thousand coupons issued. Catalina's coupon system is already operated by 32 retailers in 5,000 stores across North America. Its machines read 64m shopping baskets a week - 40 per cent of the total - and are used by 300 brand manufacturers. A study by the US Food Marketing Institute last year suggested that in spite of their prevalence, the applications of such front-end electronic marketing systems were still in their infancy. But the report also raised concerns about their long-term effectiveness, consumer privacy, data ownership and fair trade practices. Similar systems are now being touted around the globe, especially in Europe and Australasia. But whether they will have such an impact overseas is open to doubt. The structure of the UK food retailing market, in particular, is very different from that of the US on many levels. In North America, for instance, IBM is the computer standard for most retailers. Although Asda operates the same IBM system in the UK, Tesco uses Siemens-Nixdorf equipment while J. Sainsbury uses ICL, complicating the design of universal systems. The predominance of retailers' own brand products in the UK may also muddy the waters. In many categories, the brand managers' biggest rivals are the retailers themselves and there is clearly a potential conflict of interest in promoting individual brands. But the rival food retailers will be watching Asda's experiment with interest. If it is a success, they are likely to move quickly to install their own systems.</p>

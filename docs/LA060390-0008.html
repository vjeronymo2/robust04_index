			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CORAZON AQUINO  </P> <P> It's time for Aquino to step down before something tragic happens to her.  Ferdinand Marcos may have been corrupt and may have abused his power, but  Aquino, though her intentions are good, is incompetent. For quite different  reasons, both leaders have led the Philippines down the path to  self-destruction.  </P> <P> KENNETH L. ZIMMERMAN, Cypress  </P></p>

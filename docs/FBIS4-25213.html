			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Jiang Chun (3068 3196)] </F>   [Text] The provincial government general office recently  issued a circular outlining the plan for this year's work of  redressing irregularities in various trades in Anhui.    To ensure continuous deepening reform in Anhui, the circular  called on all localities to carry out the plan made by the  provincial party committee and government, foster a fine  workstyle in various trades, and give special attention to  solving hot-point issues that have caused strong complaints in  society.    The circular pointed out that this year's work of redressing  irregularities in various trades would focus on the following  aspects: conscientiously screening party and government organs  and their personnel to check if they have taken advantage of  their position to use enterprises' vehicles, computers, or  communications equipment, and if they transfer enterprises'  funds to their own units' "small banks" for private use under  any excuse; screening party, government, and administrative  organs to see if they set up "small banks" in their units;  continuing to pay attention to unauthorized fees; and resolutely  canceling unreasonable fees to alleviate the burden of  enterprises and the masses. In fostering a fine workstyle in  various trades, localities must continue to screen checkpoints  and fee collection stations along highways and rivers, adjust  the structure of electricity charges in rural areas, and  consolidate achievements scored in the past.    The circular urged governments at all levels to  conscientiously strengthen leadership in redressing  irregularities in various trades, regard this issue as an  important task against corruption and promoting a clean  government and place it high on the agenda, pay attention to key  enterprises and units, gradually establish and perfect various  regulations and laws, and strictly investigate and prosecute  cases in violation of laws and discipline to create a sound  social environment for reform and opening up in Anhui.</p>

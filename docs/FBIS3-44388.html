			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, 31 Dec (XINHUA) -- A negotiating team from  the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits [ARATS]  held working negotiations with the Straits Exchange Foundation  [SEF] in Taibei [Taipei] from 18-22 December on implementing  agreements pertaining to the Gu-Wang talks. They specifically  discussed the issue of repatriating hijackers across the Taiwan  Strait. A reporter interviewed an ARATS official on this issue.    The official said: The recent round of negotiations focused  on the repatriation of hijackers across the Taiwan Strait.  During the negotiations, we made substantial progress and  achieved major consensus. The two sides unanimously held that  hijacking airliners through violent, coercive, or other means is  a serious crime, that it should be punished sternly, and  hijackers should, in principle, be repatriated without  exception. On the basis of this understanding and through  serious consultations, the two sides initially laid out the  basic stylistic framework for an agreement on cross-strait  repatriation of hijackers while leaving the language of such an  agreement to further discussion.    According to the official, the basic stylistic framework for  an agreement on cross-strait repatriation of hijackers covers,  by and large, the scope of applicability, the principles of  repatriation, compulsory measures, repatriation requests and  methods, and handovers. It is understood the agreement will  apply to people on either side of the Taiwan Strait who hijack  an airliner from one side and divert it to the other through  violent, coercive, or other means. In principle, Mazu and Mawei  will be used as handover points in any seaborne repatriation  operation; the two sides also agreed to select Jinmen and Xiamen  as handover points in light of their actual needs.    According to the official, negotiators from the two  organizations signaled the need for their organizations to carry  on negotiations on the issue of repatriating hijackers at an  early date and to hold further consultations on the wording of  several clauses in the related document in the interest of  reaching an agreement at an early date.</p>

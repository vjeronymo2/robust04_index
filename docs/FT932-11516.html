			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Small fry on big shelves Small food producers and big supermarket chains could both benefit from closer co-operation. But the small companies must gear up to meet the supermarket's quality and delivery requirements while the retailers must make themselves more accessible to small suppliers. Achieving these objectives lies behind a food industry initiative being managed by Strathclyde University. It aims to help small regional suppliers win more shelf space in the big supermarkets. The initiative includes regional meetings between small suppliers and supermarket buyers and seminars to spread good practice. New information technology and scanning systems mean that it is now easier for large multiples to put products on sale in a small number of stores. Like most sectors of the economy the food processing industry is mostly made up of a large number of small enterprises and a few large firms, according to a report* by the Strathclyde Food Project team. These companies are often unable to supply products consistently and on time for national distribution and have problems communicating with the headquarters of large retailers. They are often undercapiTalised and lack access to product-testing facilities. However, they have a number of strengths including an innovative approach to new products and product processing, product specialisation and a knowledge of their local markets. To benefit from using more small suppliers, supermarkets may need to establish a small business desk to oversee contacts with new or small suppliers or appoint a liaison officer to deal with contacts, the report suggests. As part of the initiative the project team is keen to increase awareness among business support organisations of the problems of small food producers. *The Strathclyde Food Project, Action Plan for the Development of Retail Sales Opportunities for Regional Suppliers.

			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / Suzuki reprieve for plant in Spain Suzuki of Japan has dropped its threat to close its Spanish subsidiary, but it will today tell workers that production will continue only if unions agree to large job cuts. The move marks a shift in Suzuki's former determination to wind up its Santana Motor subsidiary in Linares, southern Spain, unless it received financial support from the government. Four-wheel drive vehicles are made at the plant, which employs 2,400 workers. The Japanese group, which owns about 80 per cent of Santana, placed it in receivership at the end of last month, saying it had accumulated losses of Pta21bn (Pounds 101m) in the last three years. The Industry Ministry said yesterday that Suzuki had agreed to remain Santana's dominant shareholder 'for the time being' and had undertaken to make a 'substantial' financial contribution to its balance sheet. It is believed the Japanese parent company will write off a considerable part of the estimated Pta16bn debt owed to it by Santana. In exchange for keeping open the Linares plant, which accounts for virtually the sole industrial activity in the area, Suzuki wants to cut the labour force by as much as 50 per cent. It is likely the Spanish administration will allocate emergency funds to ease the labour shake-out. The commitment given by Suzuki follows talks at the Industry Ministry last week between Mr Yoshio Saito, the group's chairman who is also deputy chairman of Santana, and senior ministry officials. Mr Saito was told that the sudden closure of Santana would represent a serious political and social problem for the government and that it would rebound badly on general Japanese interests in Spain. The decision to keep the Linares plant operating gives both Suzuki and the administration a breathing space in which to search for another industrial group willing to shoulder the Santana burden. A senior official in the domestic vehicle sector said it was possible that a Korean car group could eventually take the place of Suzuki in Linares.</p>

			<p><P> September 25, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> TONGUE TIED: NEW CHARGER PUNTER GETS IN BIND OVER SHOELACES  </P> <P> Hank Ilesic hadn't even wiped all the shaving cream off his face Sunday before  a bunch of reporters wanted to know what all this fuss was about his right  shoe.  </P> <P> Ilesic was called in by the Chargers from Canada last week to take over the  punting duties from Lewis Colbert, who had a dismal 33.3-yard average in the  first two games. Ilesic, a 13-year veteran of the Canadian Football League, has  been in town only long enough to figure out it's a good deal warmer here than  in Toronto, where he averaged 44.0 yards a punt last season with the Argonauts.  </P> <P> So he has been practicing his punting with this funny-sized American football  for a few days. He was all set to give it a go against the Kansas City Chiefs  before 40,128 spectators at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium when, just a few  minutes before kickoff, Chief Coach Marty Schottenheimer beckoned the  officiating crew and informed them that Ilesic's shoe was illegal.  </P> <P> Huh?  </P> <P> Yeah, it seems this brand of shoe has a leather tongue that covers the laces.  One of the officials ended up on the phone to Art McNally, supervisor of  officials for the National Football League, and asked him if it was OK for  Ilesic to kick. McNally's answer was something to the effect of: "Not unless  the laces are showing."  </P> <P> Well, Sid Brooks, the Charger equipment manager, solved the problem easily  enough, cutting away enough leather so the laces were exposed. Ilesic kicked.  The Chargers defeated the Chiefs, 21-6. And everything was dandy.  </P> <P> In fact, Ilesic really couldn't understand what all the commotion was about.  </P> <P> "It's no big deal," he said. "We have a game to play. If you're upset about it,  it's going to affect your performance."  </P> <P> It seems that when Charger Coach Dan Henning told Ilesic he couldn't use the  shoe as is, Ilesic shrugged, put on the makeshift version and punted five times  for an average of 44.8 yards.  </P> <P> "It probably disturbed me a lot more than it did Hank," said Henning, who made  the announcement about the shoe problem as if he was breaking the biggest news  since the Jim McMahon trade. Yet Henning also gave his new punter a vote of  confidence, saying: "Under the conditions I think he had a pretty good day."  </P> <P> Remember, this guy Ilesic has been around for a few years. His punting career  in the CFL survived 13 seasons and 1,573 kicks. So it was no surprise to Joe  Madden, the Charger special teams coach, that he was able to jump into this  strange shoe and do the job.  </P> <P> "He's a professional," Madden said. "He'll improve on that, I promise."  </P> <P> Which is saying a lot, considering Ilesic gave the fans their first opportunity  this season to applaud a punt. That happened midway through the second quarter  when he sent Chief returner Naz Worthen retreating at a sprinter's pace for a  ball that traveled 60 yards.  </P> <P> The next episode of the "Hank's Punting Shoe" will begin today, when Brooks  stuffs the thing in a Federal Express package and sends it to the league office  with a photo of an American-made shoe that looks just like it. Brooks isn't  convinced there's anything wrong with Canada's version.  </P> <P> "They said the shoe was made in Canada," said Brooks of the protest. "I said,  'Yeah, rain shoes are made in Canada, too, and we use them.' "  </P> <P> Ilesic doesn't plan to spend a lot of time worrying about the whole thing. He's  taking an attitude of, "Hey, if the shoe fits, wear it." To him, the Chiefs'  ploy was all just part of the game.  </P> <P> "Sure," he said. "The new kid on the street. If you can distract the opposition  in any way, try it."  </P> <P> If not distracted, Ilesic certainly noted a few differences punting in an NFL  game than in Canada.  </P> <P> "Everything is so much quicker here," he said. "The incoming rush, the punt  returners. You have to get the ball off a lot quicker."  </P> <P> Ilesic says he has waited for this opportunity for years and plans to make the  most of it. He says he doesn't know a whole lot about the Chargers or their  history, and he hasn't seen much more of San Diego than the stadium and his  hotel. But he has a good feeling about this place.  </P> <P> "I don't feel like a stranger, an outsider," he said. "In due time, I'll settle  down and get accustomed to the surroundings."  </P> <P> It's bound to get easier than the first game. Then again, he may not get this  much attention again for a long time.  </P> <P> "Nothing like breaking into the league with some controversy," he said.  </P></p>

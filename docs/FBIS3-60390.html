			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [UK press release from the Department of the Environment: </F> "Europe To Give Ecolabelling Higher Priority"]    [Text] Environment Minister Baroness Denton today welcomed  the award of the first European Community ecolabel to a major  British manufacturer.    The ecolabels, which are awarded to products which satisfy  cradle to grave environmental criteria, will provide clear and  reliable guidance to consumers on which products are least  harmful to the environment.    Speaking at the UK Ecolabelling Board, Lady Denton said: "I  am delighted that the first EC ecolabel is being awarded and  that the award is to a washing machine produced by a major UK  manufacturer. This is an important milestone in the history of  the scheme."    "Hoover are to be congratulated, as are the UK Ecolabelling  Board who developed the criteria, which were the first to be  adopted by the European Commission. It is the UK which appears  to be setting the pace on this scheme."    "My pleasure at being able to participate in this event is,  however, tinged with disappointment at knowing that there is  still no early prospect of building up the level of momentum we  would like to see with the addition of further products."    "Despite the enormous efforts of the UK Ecolabelling Board,  the many delays there have been in getting the scheme into  operation mean that it so far covers only washing machines and  dishwashers."    "Now that the first labels have been awarded I hope that the  Commission will give the work greater priority and that those  member states who have as yet made no contribution to the Scheme  will be drawn into playing an active part in it. We will  continue to exert pressure on them at all levels to do so."  <H5>  [Notes to Editors] </H5>   The European ecolabelling scheme was agreed by Environment  Ministers in December 1991 and set up under Council Regulation  (EEC) 880/92 of 23 March 1992, published in the Official Journal  of the European Communities on 11 April 1992 (L99 Volume 35).  The Regulation has direct effect on UK law.    The scheme is a voluntary one. The purpose of the scheme is  to identify products which are less harmful to the environment  than equivalent brands across the whole of their life cycles.  The aim is to encourage the design, production, marketing and  use of such products and so achieve a real environmental gain.  The scheme applies to all consumer goods except for food, drink  and pharmaceuticals. The scheme will offer advantages for  industry and consumers, especially with the introduction of the  Single Market. Criteria for labels will be valid across the EC.    UK Regulations which came into force on 1 November 1992  established an independent body, the United Kingdom Ecolabelling  Board, to administer and promote the scheme nationally. Experts  from wide range of relevant backgrounds were appointed to the  Board. The Chairman, Dr Elizabeth Nelson, was appointed on 5  March 1992.

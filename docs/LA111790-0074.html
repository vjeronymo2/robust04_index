			<p><P> November 17, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WESTMINSTER LEFT IN DUST IN FIRST ROUND  </P> <P> David McDivitt and Jim Zopelis each scored two touchdowns in Canyon Country  Canyon High School's 40-0 victory over Westminster in a first-round Division I  game Friday at Westminster High.  </P> <P> Canyon (10-1) advanced to the second round against Bishop Amat, a 31-13 winner  over Lakewood.  </P> <P> "Canyon is a real disciplined team," Westminster Coach Stan Clark said. "Our  defense couldn't stop them and our offense couldn't get on track.  </P> <P> "We prefer to run the ball and Canyon took that option away from us."  </P> <P> Westminster (5-5-1) was held to 107 yards rushing in 35 carries.  </P> <P> The Lions' passing game didn't fare much better. Three quarterbacks completed  four of 19 passes for 60 yards. Canyon's defense sacked two of Westminster's  three quarterbacks six times.  </P> <P> The lone bright spot for Westminster was the defensive play of Vance Senteno,  who had a sack, an interception and recovered a Canyon fumble.  </P> <P> Canyon rushed for 170 yards in 40 carries.  </P> <P> Bialas completed 10 of 18 passes for 222 yards and two touchdowns -- including  completions of 36 and 20 yards to Jim Zopelis, who had five catches for 125  yards.

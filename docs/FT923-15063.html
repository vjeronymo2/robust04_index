			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / A move away from meltdown: Next week's G7 summit will seek ways of reducing the threat from Soviet-designed nuclear plants Growing alarm about the defects of Soviet-designed nuclear reactors has prompted western leaders to draw up a wide-ranging emergency programme, intended to make the plants safe before there is another Chernobyl-type catastrophe. The Group of Seven summit meeting in Munich next week is expected to approve a short-term action plan, which would involve spending several hundred million dollars on the 25 most hazardous reactors - in Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia and three former Soviet republics: Russia, Lithuania and Ukraine. This could lead to a more extensive long-term programme, with cost estimates running between Dollars 5bn (Pounds 2.6bn) and Dollars 20bn, to bring all reactors in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union up to western safety standards. Although the 1986 Chernobyl disaster had shown the shortcomings of Soviet-designed nuclear plants, the awesome scale of the problem only became apparent as the Soviet bloc unravelled during 1990. That enabled western experts to examine the reactors in detail. Soon after German reunification, the government in Bonn closed down the four Soviet-designed pressurised water reactors (PWRs) it inherited at Greifswald on the Baltic coast. Then, early in 1991, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) urged the Bulgarian government to take immediate action to improve safety at four similar PWRs at Kozloduy. Quite apart from the basic design defects, notably the absence of an emergency cooling system and containment to enclose the reactors in an accident, IAEA inspectors found that management and workers were too demoralised and incompetent to run the plant properly. Even the basic operating manuals and plant drawings had been lost. Kozloduy itself is a safer place today. A team of 20 nuclear specialists from western Europe has been working there for almost a year, with funding from the EC and technical co-ordination from the World Association of Nuclear Operators (Wano), to improve the management and operation of the plant. But no one has started to tackle the fundamental flaws in the Soviet VVER 230 reactor design. Elsewhere in eastern Europe and the CIS, there still has been virtually no practical action to solve even the most urgent short-term safety problems. The past 18 months have seen countless visits to Soviet-designed power stations by different western organisations - nuclear utilities, equipment manufacturers, regulatory bodies, and international organisations - all looking for research and commercial opportunities and often working at cross purposes. Mr Morris Rosen, director of the IAEA nuclear safety division, says the initiatives are unco-ordinated and often dictated not by need or importance 'but solely by the desire of donors to participate. Representatives of east European countries question whether assistance is focused on their needs or on donor research and commercial interests'. 'Up to the present time, the west has shown no inclination to improve the safety of Russian reactors,' says Lord Marshall, former head of the UK's Central Electricity Generating Board and now Wano's chairman. 'They have only shown an inclination to analyse safety from their own point of view.' Meanwhile potentially serious accidents continue to occur. Mr Viktor Sidorenko, Russia's deputy atomic energy minister, said in Moscow this week there had been two incidents last year and two more in the first half of 1992 that were rated at level 3 on the 7 point international scale of nuclear accidents ('serious fault involving loss of protection or heavy pollution or radiation of personnel'). A radiation leak last March from one of the four Chernobyl-type RBMK reactors at Sosnovy Bor near St Petersburg gave western governments a new sense of urgency. The outcome is the emergency programme drawn up for the Munich meeting next week, which is intended to provide both co-ordination and substantial non-commercial funding. Most of the Dollars 700m to Dollars 800m required will be provided by the G7 members. The programme will concentrate on the 10 VVER 230 reactors (in Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia and Russia) and 15 RBMKs (in Russia, Lithuania and Ukraine) which have the most serious design defects. The remaining 32 Soviet-designed PWRs are more modern and come closer to meeting western standards. Most of the work in the programme is expected to be completed within two years. It is intended to provide: Improved operational safety through better staff training, management procedures, technical manuals and so on. New hardware such as back-up diesel generators, computerised control rooms and fire walls. Nuclear regulators, independent of the plant operators, with powers to inspect reactors and shut them down if necessary. An overall energy strategy, which will enable each country to assess its need for nuclear power in relation to other energy sources. The organisational details will not be settled until the G7 leaders meet next week. The EC countries favour a genuinely multilateral programme run from an office in Brussels, while the US and Japan prefer bilateral assistance - with a co-ordinating mechanism to ensure that all the necessary work is done without wasteful duplication. In the discussions running up to Munich, the UK government has been particularly keen to divorce emergency assistance, which it sees as a non-commercial safety precaution, from the commercial issue of upgrading the more modern Soviet-designed reactors to international standards and building new ones to operate well into the next century. 'Investment in such stations should await the results of the energy studies and the introduction of economic pricing,' said Mr Timothy Walker, head of the atomic energy division at the Department of Trade and Industry. 'The decision on which and how many should be upgraded needs to be made on an economic and commercial basis in the light of alternative ways of meeting energy demand.' So the G7 meeting will point out the need for a long-term upgrading programme - and may ask the World Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development to work out a way of funding it through commercial loans - but the seven leaders are in no mood to commit the west to spending the Dollars 10bn required. Mr Andrei Konoplyanik, deputy minister for fuel and energy, made it clear this week that the Russians too are wary of grandiose proposals whose 'major benefits will be received by western producers of nuclear energy equipment'. They know that western manufacturers, starved of orders from their own nuclear-shy utilities, are looking forward to a feast in the east. Siemens of Germany, Framatome of France and Westinghouse of the US have been particularly active. But Mr Konoplyanik, who will be accompanying President Boris Yeltsin to Munich, says Russia would be prepared to accept western assistance with a long-term energy programme involving the closure of the RBMK and older VVER reactors over the next decade, expansion of non-nuclear generating capacity and 'joint creation of a new generation of highly safe nuclear power stations on the basis of Russian R&amp;D'. He estimates its total cost at Dollars 24bn over 10 years. Even the G7's emergency programme may be unacceptable to the Russians. The west does not want Russia to use its assistance to keep dangerous reactors going indefinitely. But if it demands a firm commitment to decommission the RBMKs and VVER 230s as quickly as possible, the Russian atomic energy ministry, new home of the old Soviet nuclear establishment, will object. Mr Sidorenko made it clear that, while Russia has no plans to build any more RBMKs, it is not ready to close the existing plants. And it is going ahead with the construction of three new VVERs. Even the most zealous anti-nuclear campaigners accept the region is too short of electricity to close down the most dangerous plants immediately. The power shortage is most acute in Bulgaria, which relies on Kozloduy for 35 to 40 per cent of its electricity. Its vulnerability was underlined last February when faults shut down two of the reactors - and consumers throughout the country had their electricity cut off for two hours in every four. Elsewhere, the nuclear share of electricity generation in 1991 was 51 per cent in Hungary, 45 per cent in Lithuania, 28 per cent in Czechoslovakia and 25 per cent in Ukraine. (The comparable figure for the UK was 20 per cent.) In Russia as a whole, nuclear plants generated 12 per cent of electricity, but the share is considerably higher in the industrialised European part of the country - where there is no spare non-nuclear generating capacity. However, Greenpeace maintains that all 15 RBMK reactors in the former Soviet Union could be phased out of operation within five years, by building new gas-fired power stations and persuading consumers and industry to waste less energy. Energy prices are still well below world levels and most Russian households have neither electricity meters nor thermostats. The atomic energy ministry admits that Russians waste a lot of electricity but says the country lacks the technical resources to increase efficiency nearly as fast as Greenpeace claims is possible. Most Russian nuclear engineers remain proud of their achievements - and reluctant to admit that the RBMK has the fundamental design flaws identified by their western colleagues. But they recognise that its demise is now inevitable. Entek, the R&amp;D Institute for Power Engineering in Moscow, now believes the best way to maintain an active Russian nuclear industry is to develop a 'radically new nuclear technology - one that is capable of resolving the fuel and power problems the whole world will face in the next century'. Entek's favourite candidate is a 1000MW fast reactor cooled by molten lead, which its scientists say could be developed within a dozen years. For anyone concerned about the present generation of Soviet-designed plants, that may sound an alarming proposition, but the engineers insist the lead-cooled reactor would be safer than anything on offer from the west.</p>

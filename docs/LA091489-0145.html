			<p><P> September 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROSTENKOWSKI YIELDS ON CAPITAL GAINS TAX PLAN;  </P> <P> BUSH-SUPPORTED MEASURE UP FOR VOTE AS DEMOCRATS OPPOSE COMPROMISE  </P> <P> House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.) conceded  defeat Wednesday in his effort to forge a compromise on reducing the capital  gains tax, clearing the way for approval of a proposal supported by President  Bush to cut the tax on investment profits over a 2 1/2-year period.  </P> <P> The panel is likely to vote today, lawmakers said, in favor of a measure  championed by Rep. Ed Jenkins (D-Ga.) and supported by a coalition of all 13  Republicans on the committee and six Democrat members. It would reduce the tax  rate on most capital gains to about 20% on a temporary basis through the end of  1991.  </P> <P> After a lengthy meeting with House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.),  Rostenkowski told reporters that he would no longer block a committee vote on  the Administration-supported measure.  </P> <P> "We'll probably go to committee (today) and entertain the Jenkins amendment,"  Rostenkowski said. Asked if the measure would win, Rostenkowski replied: "Yes."  </P> <P> Opponents of the Jenkins proposal, who argue that it unfairly benefits the  wealthy, conceded that it probably would prevail on the House floor.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Senate Plan for IRAs  </P> <P> Capital gains taxes, which are imposed on profits from the sale of stocks, real  estate and other assets, are now taxed like ordinary income, usually at 28% but  at a rate as high as 33% for some taxpayers. Supporters contend that a lower  rate would stimulate additional investment and spur greater economic growth.  </P> <P> A cut in the capital gains rate is expected to produce a one-time windfall to  the Treasury as investors sell stocks to take advantage of the lower rates, but  it probably would reduce federal revenues over the long-term.  </P> <P> In the Senate, key Democrats are backing an alternative plan that would replace  a capital gains tax cut with a proposal to expand tax breaks for individual  retirement accounts.  </P> <P> Rostenkowski, who had vowed to help lead opposition to a capital gains tax cut,  was faced with the threat of losing control of the tax bill if the committee  did not act by the end of the week. California Rep. Leon E. Panetta (D-Carmel  Valley), the House Budget Committee chairman, had pledged to bring a tax and  spending measure to the House floor to ensure that Congress votes on a 1990  deficit-reduction package before the fiscal year begins Oct. 1.  </P> <P> To avoid serious damage to the committee's role as the designated originator of  tax legislation, Rostenkowski agreed to allow a vote on the Jenkins proposal  that would exclude 30% of all capital gains from taxes through the end of 1991.  After that date, the rate is supposed to return to 28% and be adjusted to avoid  taxes on gains that simply reflect inflation.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Democrats Oppose Compromise  </P> <P> In seeking a compromise, Rostenkowski had been attempting to persuade tax  writers to back a plan that would allow taxes on capital gains to be adjusted  for inflation and to add further tax breaks for assets held for long periods.  </P> <P> Although Rostenkowski appeared to have won support from the coalition that  supports the capital gains cut, most of the 23 Democrats on the committee vowed  to oppose any such compromise. Rostenkowski was unwilling to desert a majority  of his fellow Democrats to ram the measure through his committee.  </P> <P> Once he failed in that effort, Rostenkowski tried to persuade lawmakers to go  along with a "bare bones" bill that would raise the minimum $5.3 billion needed  to meet the goal of last April's congressional budget agreement with the White  House.  </P> <P> When that approach also ran aground, lawmakers said, Rostenkowski decided to  accept defeat rather than lose control of the tax bill because of the  stalemate.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Managua, 25 Apr (ACAN-EFE) -- In Managua today,  General Humberto Ortega, the chief of the Nicaraguan Armed  Forces, warned that "if the Army should disappear (in this  country), there will be war."    The Sandinist People's Army (EPS), founded in 1979, has been  reduced from 84,000 to 14,000 men over the past four years.  There are sectors in the country, however, that argue in favor  of the complete abolishment of the Armed Forces.    Ortega's warning, according to what political analysts  believe, was directed at the Nicaraguan Civic Movement. This  group wants Nicaragua to have no army, as in Costa Rica.    Ortega was one of the speakers at a two-day seminar on the  relationship between the military and civilians, which was  hosted by the National Assembly.    During his speech, Ortega stressed, "There would be total  anarchy without an army in Nicaragua." The forum was funded by  the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs  (INDI).    "Allow me to tell those who argue the Army should not exist  that, if we should disappear, then 10 or 15 armies of the  various antagonistic political and economic forces that still  have some degree of clout would appear on the scene tomorrow,"  Ortega said.    The four-star Sandinist general underscored that "with no  army, there will be more armies and war in Nicaragua."    "There are sectors in Nicaragua that argue that democracy  should mean the complete undoing of the historic changes that  occurred in 1979 (when the Sandinists defeated Somoza in an  armed conflict).    "Others, namely the ultra-leftists, think democracy should  be  founded on the revolutionary past, which was necessary at the  time, but is long gone," the military leader pointed out.    "We are the ideal of those who believe that some day there  will be no Army," Ortega said, "but when the United States has  no Army then Nicaragua will have no Army. That is something we  would really like to happen."    Ortega, who has commanded the EPS since its founding, told  those present that the Armed Forces collaborated in the seizure  of 180,296 weapons of all types during 1992 and 1993. The  weapons were in the hands of civilians who contributed to the  country's lack of security.    The military leader called for a consensus regarding the  "consolidation" and "legalization" of the Army against those who  still believe that it is possible to change Nicaragua's history  and throw the country into another war.    "The Army is no longer the armed branch of the party, as it  was in the past for the Sandinist Front. Nevertheless, it is  not going to be an instrument of the other party, and much less  the armed branch of the wealthy classes," Ortega warned.    According to the Sandinist general, Nicaragua's main problem  is not the relationship between civilians and the military.  Instead, it is the backwardness "of a nation that has no  democratic experience whatsoever and the conflict between those  who want democracy and those who do not."    Ortega insisted that the Army has respected all economic,  diplomatic, social, and financial policies that the Violeta  Chamorro government has instituted, although some have  criticized these policies as "good" and others as "bad."    Other speakers at the first part of the seminar were  Nicaraguan Presidency Minister Antonio Lacayo, National Assembly  President Luis Humberto Guzman, and INDI President Kenneth  Whollack.    The forum also features experts from the United States,  Spain, Portugal, Chile, and Argentina.</p>

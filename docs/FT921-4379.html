			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / Appointments: An upstream struggle Ed Gallagher, who was appointed last week as the new chief executive of the National Rivers Authority, comes from an industry background. Most recently, he has been the director at Amersham International with responsibility for manufacturing operations in the UK, US and Germany, and global responsibilities for distribution and information technology. A chartered engineer, Gallagher, 47, graduated from Sheffield with a first class degree in engineering. He joined Black &amp; Decker in 1971, first in the UK, then from 1981 in the US where he was director of business analysis and later of market and product development. He moved to Amersham in 1986. Gallagher joins the NRA at a difficult time because of the government's plans to set up a new environment agency which would take over many of the NRA's responsibilities. The NRA and environmental groups are fighting the proposal in order to safeguard the NRA's position as an effective environmental watchdog. He is also stepping into the shoes of John Bowman, the chief executive at the launch of the NRA when the water industry in England and Wales was privatised in 1989, who resigned last June because of 'serious shortcomings' which led to overspending of around Pounds 1m on new headquarters in Bristol.</p>

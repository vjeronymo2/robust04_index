			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / International Company News: Christiania Bank back in black Christiania Bank, Norway's second biggest bank, has returned to a full-year profit for the first time in five years, helped by interest rate reductions, operating efficiencies and gains on securities. The bank swung to a pre-tax profit of NKr862m (Dollars 116m) in 1993 from a loss of NKr1.23bn in the previous year. The other dominant feature of 1993 was 'our global share offering which strengthened the bank's equity by more than NKr2bn in new core capital,' said Mr Borger Lenth, managing director. The bank's capital adequacy rose from 8.6 per cent to 13.7 per cent of risk-weighted assets at the end of December while core capital doubled to 5.9 per cent from 3 per cent. Net interest income at NKr3.06bn was little changed from the previous year. Non-interest income shot up by 35 per cent to NKr2.27bn. Gains on securities reached NKr731m, against losses of NKr94m in 1992. Net gains on foreign exchange and other financial instruments fell to NKr286m from NKr605m, due to lower profitability by the bank's own trading in financial instruments, and because 1992 was particularly good, Christiania said. Operating expenses rose slightly to NKr2.92bn from NKr2.87bn. 'Excluding the costs relating to the acquisition of new branches and the increase in the charges payable to the banks' guarantee fund, Christiania reduced its expenses by 2 per cent in 1993,' it said. The bank almost reduced by half losses on loans and guarantees, to NKr1.45bn from NKr2.8bn, but is still plagued by high losses in the fisheries sector, which accounted for NKr939m of the total, of which NKr114m was incurred in the fourth quarter. Net non-performing loans were cut to NKr4.7bn from NKr5.9bn while gross non-performers fell to NKr9.6bn from NKr12.1bn. The bank said the reduction in loan loss provisions and in the volume of non-performing commitments in all sectors except fisheries, was primarily due to lower interest rates and a strengthening of procedures for account monitoring. IBCA, the UK-based credit rating agency, has raised the ratings of Christiania Bank, Den norske Bank and Sparebanken Nor. Christiania's individual rating was raised to C/D from D/E, the long-term rating to A from A- and the short-term rating to A1 from A2. DnB's respective ratings were raised to D from D/E, to A from A- and to A1 from A2. Nor has been raised to C from C/D, to A from A- and to A1 from A2 due to an especially strong recovery in 1993. 'The higher ratings reflect the improving financial condition of the banks and the positive outlook for the Norwegian economy, and for the banks themselves, for 1994 and beyond,' IBCA said.</p>

			<p>940107 FT  07 JAN 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Training tape jogs the memory Every personal computer user knows the problem with training: a day after the course and the intricacies of the software are easily understood; a month later and the mental fog has descended. To replace the need to look up procedures, training specialist Futuremedia, of West Sussex, has developed an audio cassette-based training system to jog the memory. The Q-PC comprises a small black box, plugged in between the PC and keyboard, and a cassette, on which is a voice interspersed with audio 'bleeps'. When the cassette is played on a personal stereo, connected to the PC, the voice instructs the user while the 'bleeps' instruct the PC to perform the task. Futuremedia has cassettes to help with popular software packages, or can develop specific software. Large companies can buy a system to develop their own training packages.

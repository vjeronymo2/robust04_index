According to the source the attack was launched on 'Shuresh'  camp in Khurmal on Thursday, where the PUK organizational  committee lies.    At least ten partisan operations have been carried out  against the PUK, headed by Jalal Talabani, over the past ten  days, during which several of its members have been killed.    The new waves of operations are in retaliation for the  January occupation of Islamic Movements' headquarters and bases  north of Iraq by the PUK forces.</p>

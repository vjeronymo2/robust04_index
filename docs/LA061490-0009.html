			<p><P> June 14, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONTINUING CONTROVERSY OVER FEDERAL FUNDS FOR ARTISTS  </P> <P> The essay by Edwin Meese III and Bruce Fein ("High Clerics of Art Have Had  Enough," Commentary, May 21) shows that, when it comes to art, everyone has an  opinion. Their opinion, to which they are entitled in this free and diverse  country, is that the National Endowment for the Arts ought to be abolished. The  case upon which they build it, however, is not one to inspire confidence in  them as either art critics or lawyers.  </P> <P> They assert that the public would have been better off investing in "defaulted  junk bonds" than in government-assisted art because the endowment has not  produced "artistic masterpieces that promise to live for the ages," that there  have been no "NEA-funded artists who would do honor to Van Gogh, Picasso,  Mozart, Rubens, Monet, Beethoven, Voltaire or Shakespeare."  </P> <P> How to address this remarkable conclusion? With the fact that the authors are  comparing contemporary artists helped in the last 25 years with recognized  masters, many of whom were long dead by the time their work was fully  appreciated? With the irony in their naming only European artists, implying  that America is a cultural wasteland? With their criticism of NEA Chairman John  Frohnmayer, whom they say "shows no glitter as a talent scout for fledgling  genius?" True enough, Frohnmayer has been on the job for seven months and  hasn't a single Shakespeare to his credit. Get with it, John!  </P> <P> In commenting on what they perceive as the "arrogance" of the arts community in  its request for a comparatively small amount of federal leadership and  assistance, Meese and Fein assert that only freeloaders accept even meager  support from their government. Is it not ironic, if not arrogant, for those who  have made part of their own living and reputations on taxpayer support to  suggest that the only good artist is a starving artist?  </P> <P> The nation would have been better served had public officials paid more  attention to the criminal conditions and bungling that led to the "defaulted  junk bonds" and savings and loan crisis. The $2,000 bill each American likely  will have to pay to remedy that fiasco pales next to the 68 cents per year each  pays for the arts endowment and its support of arts education programs,  museums, local orchestras, theater and dance companies and public television  programs. What will it be, folks: 68 cents for the arts or $2,000 to help  defray the cost of a junk bond dealer's Mercedes?  </P> <P> I can hardly wait to see their next opinion piece, "Meese and Fein on  Investing."  </P> <P> JACK LICHTENSTEIN  </P> <P> Director, Office of Public Affairs  </P> <P> National Endowment for the Arts  </P> <P> Washington, D.C.  </P></p>

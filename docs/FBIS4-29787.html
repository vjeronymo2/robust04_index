			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 21 KYODO -- Japan is considering  holding ministerial-level trade talks with the United States in  Washington around July 5, a senior official of the Ministry of  International Trade and Industry said Tuesday.    The talks are aimed at striking an accord on the three  priority areas for the "framework" negotiations before the July  8-10 Naples summit of the Group of Seven (G-7) key industrial  countries, the official said.    Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa and International Trade and  Industry Minister Eijiro Hata will likely visit the U.S. before  flying to Italy for the annual summit, said the official who  declined to be named.    The three framework trade priority sectors are insurance,  government procurement, and trade in autos and auto parts.    The official said the two countries will hold  subcabinet-level talks on auto and auto parts trade in  Washington in the first half of next week, aiming to reach  consensus on "objective criteria" as a yardstick to assess the  openness of the Japanese auto market.    The official said he is not certain about whether Tokyo and  Washington will reach a complete agreement on auto trade before  the Naples summit.    Japan will decide whether or not to postpone final  settlements on auto trade beyond the summit at the end of next  week by evaluating results of discussions at the planned  subcabinet-level talks, the official said.    He said subcabinet-level talks will also be held in  Washington next week on government procurement and insurance.</p>

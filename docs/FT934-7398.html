			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / International Company News: Sharp gains at Westpac and National Australia Bank FURTHER signs of the recovering fortunes of the Australian banking sector were evident yesterday when Melbourne-based National Australia Bank, which also owns the Clydesdale, Northern, and Yorkshire banks in the UK and the National Irish Bank, and Sydney's Westpac reported strong profit growth in the year to end-September. NAB, viewed as one of the nation's strongest banks, said that profits after tax, abnormal items and outside equity interests, jumped to ADollars 1.13bn (USDollars 730m) from ADollars 675.1m. Westpac, meanwhile, made a net profit of ADollars 39.2m, but this compared with a ADollars 1.56bn loss in the previous year. The sharply improved results follow news of a much better performance by Australia and New Zealand Bank (ANZ) earlier in the week, and bank shares - which had already risen over the past few days - generally strengthened again. NAB closed 2 cents higher at ADollars 12.88, and ANZ added 13 cents to ADollars 4.80. Westpac, however, gave up 3 cents to close at ADollars 4.60. NAB's domestically-based Australian bank business contributed ADollars 732.6m to group operating profit (before goodwill amortisation), a 15.2 per cent increase on the previous year. The specific charge for bad and doubtful debts here fell by 10.7 per cent to ADollars 335.3m, while non-accrual loans stood at ADollars 890.1m, down by 36.4 per cent on the previous year and representing 2.3 per cent of lending assets. NAB said that economic conditions had been 'mixed' but that home loan activity and bill acceptances, for business lending, had grown strongly. In the UK and Ireland, operating profits overall increased by 61.1 per cent to ADollars 292.8m - although Northern Bank saw a reduced contribution at ADollars 31.4m, down from ADollars 63.8m. The improvement would have been more marked but for a Dollars 98.8m charge for restructuring costs. Non-accrual loans fell by a fifth, to ADollars 639.1m or 2.9 per cent of lending assets. The New Zealand banks contributed operating profits of ADollars 95.1m, against ADollars 9m. This largely reflected a ADollars 80.3m contribution from Bank of New Zealand, which was acquired last November. Overall, the charge for bad and doubtful debts fell by 34 per cent, to ADollars 604.2m, while the group's tier one capital ratio stood at 7.7 per cent at the end of the year. Mr Don Angus, managing director, cautioned that unless the world economy picks up, growth in NAB's major regions would be subdued and competition intense. However, analysts have speculated recently that the bank will use its strong earnings performance to help fund acquisitions and diversify - it recently indicated that it is looking to build up a life insurance operation in the UK, for example. Unlike NAB, Westpac continued to face significant abnormal items - ADollars 325.9m, against ADollars 351.3m in the previous year, including ADollars 226m for restructuring expenses. Profit ahead of these items and tax stood at ADollars 548.1m. Westpac also saw an improvement in the bad debt situation, although its lending book remains much more troubled. The provision for bad and doubtful debts was ADollars 1.29bn (ADollars 2.8bn) - of which ADollars 558m refered to non-property related loans. Looking ahead, Mr Robert Joss, Westpac's new chief executive, warned that competition in the Australian market was likely to be intense and would put pressure on net interest margins. Conditions in the commercial property market would also be critical to the trend in bad and doubtful debt charges.</p>

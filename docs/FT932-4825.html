			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Sweden hangs sale sign on banks SWEDEN yesterday made a plea to the chairmen of the world's biggest banks to consider purchasing a Swedish bank. Mrs Anne Wibble, Sweden's finance minister, told a bankers' meeting: 'If you wish to buy a bank or part of one, don't hesitate to do so.' She was speaking at the International Monetary Conference, an annual gathering of the chairmen of the world's hundred biggest banks. None of Sweden's big banks is currently owned or controlled by overseas institutions. Prior to the election of the centre-right government, there was an effective ban on foreign ownership of them. But Swedish banks have been suffering huge loan losses over the past couple of years. Two of the big banks are already controlled by the government and a further three, including Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, have applied for government support. Mrs Wibble said yesterday that a decision on the scope and form of any public support for SE Banken, the country's biggest, would probably not be taken until the autumn. The government said early this year it agreed in principle to aid the bank, which had losses in 1992 of SKr5.6bn (Pounds 509m) and has non-performing loans totalling almost SKr25bn. SE Banken wants to conclude a deal with the government by the end of this month, but Mrs Wibble said it would take beyond that date to conclude a study of the bank's needs. The government is apparently adopting a tough stance, anxious not to be accused of giving SE Banken soft terms. The first privatisation candidate is set to be Gotabank which has consumed most of a state guarantee worth SKr10bn following losses of SKr2.4bn last year. Its healthy assets carry a value of around SKr50bn, but it has non-performing loans of SKr40bn, most of which the government is likely to dump into a separate 'bad bank' before privatisation set for early next year.</p>

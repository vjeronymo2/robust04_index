			<p>BFN     [Text] Guadalajara, (Mexico), 11 Apr (EFE) -- The 35th  Annual Assembly of the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB)  began on Monday in Guadalajara (Mexico) and focused on the need  to foster social development in Latin America just hours after  member countries agreed to increase the organization's capital.    In the opening ceremony, Mexican President Carlos Salinas de  Gortari said that now that the structural adjustment programs  are resulting in growth, there is a need to fight poverty and  social inequality.    "We need to face the challenges common to all people, to  wage  a frontal assault on poverty to ensure growth and job creation,  to build strong and lasting democracies, to protect and conserve  our natural and cultural heritage, and to continue the  unyielding fight against the criminal force of drug  trafficking," Salinas said.    IDB President Enrique Iglesias, a Uruguayan, said that  "economic growth and social integration are essential for  political stability." He also warned against populist voices  that affect social economic costs within society.    "The social costs of misadjustment and hyperinflation have  been much higher than the inevitable adjustment processes. We  see this now when we look at social investment deficits,"  Iglesias added.    Iglesias recalled a recent comment by Salinas de Gortari,  who  said that democracy is not only elections, because "people on  the social fringes cannot effectively participate in politics.  It is impossible to have full citizens' rights amid poverty and  ignorance."    Iglesias added that history has taught us that  "macroeconomic  stability is absolutely necessary" to improving social  conditions in Latin America.    "We need to redouble our efforts to continue modernizing and  to bring stability. We also need to complete the great task  that lies ahead," Iglesias said in reference to social support.    The IDB president highlighted the fact that Latin American  countries are increasing their social sector budgets and he  expressed satisfaction at the recent agreement reached by IDB  member countries to increase the IDB's funds to $40 billion.    This agreement, which was reached a few hours before the  assembly began, is a mandate so the IDB will increase by 50  percent its credit fund for loans destined to the social sectors  of Latin American and Caribbean countries.    This is going to allow us to earmark about $3.5 billion  yearly for regional social development projects, compared to  about $2 billion in 1993.    The agreement, in addition to increasing the IDB capital  from  $60 billion to $100 billion, includes the repayment of $1  billion to the Special Operations Fund (FOE), IDB's "teller  window" intended to grant very long-term financing at low  interest rates to the region's poorest countries.    Projects financed by this "teller window" will fight  poverty,  mainly in countries like Bolivia, Nicaragua, Honduras, Haiti,  and Guyana.    The National Assembly president, Mexican Finance Secretary  Pedro Aspe, highlighted in the opening ceremony that the  increase in capital will guarantee continued IDB loans at a rate  of $7.5 billion a year.    Aspe said: "Once we achieve repayment, we have urgent,  unpostponable tasks ahead; that is, to create jobs and to fight  extreme poverty."    According to the IDB's annual report, there are  approximately  200 million Latin Americans living in poverty; in other words,  46 percent of the population, which means a 2.5 percent increase  compared to a year as recent as 1986.</p>

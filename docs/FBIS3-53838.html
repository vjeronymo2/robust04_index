			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Muhammad Dahlan, member of the Palestinian </F> Security Committee to the PLO-Israel Taba negotiations, by radio  correspondent Basim Abu-Sumayyah; from the "Today's Guest"  program; place and date not given--recorded]    [Text] [Abu-Sumayyah] What are the tasks of the Security  Committee in the negotiations?    [Dahlan] The Security Committee is part of the negotiating  Palestinian delegation, which is divided into Civilian Affairs  and Security Committees. The Security Committee is responsible  for many issues. There are many personal opinions on the concept  of the Taba talks Security Committee. However, the Security  Committee discusses several important topics in the  Palestinian-Israeli agreement. The first issue is the  crossings, the second is the borders of the Jericho area, the  third is the settlements and the areas in the Gaza Strip. There  is also the security of roads and communication lines, the  Palestinian security movements, and the security of the  movements of the Israeli settlers on Palestinian roads and the  mechanism of coordinating this matter between us and the Israeli  police. These are the most important issues that were mentioned  in the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles [DOP].    [Abu-Sumayyah] It has been reported in the Israeli media  that  a coordination agreement has been reached between the Israeli  and Palestinian security bodies. Can you tell us about that?    [Dahlan] First of all, it is the Israeli side which always  raises the issue of the Israeli-Palestinian coordination or  rather the Israeli-Palestinian security coordination. This is a  serious issue. They are well aware that it creates confusion  among the Palestinians inside and outside the occupied  territory. So far, there are no issues agreed on between us and  the Israelis. Even in the DOP, there is no agreement or  substantive progress in security matters that I have already  mentioned.    Some Israeli papers have reported that progress has been  made  or a security coordination agreement reached between the  Palestinian and Israeli security bodies. I would like to say  that this is a sheer lie. There is no official or unofficial  coordination between us and the Israeli security. We do not  expect that in the near future there will be coordination on the  concept of security coordination between us and the Israelis.  However, there are measures that require coordination between  us and the Israelis, matters related to the implementation of  the DOP. For instance, the issue of the Palestinian police  force, its tasks and duties, its measures, crossing into or out  of Israeli areas, crossing into or out of the border crossing  points. These are interconnected issues which have something to  do with coordinating measures related to the police. They are  also related to security measures but these are matters for the  future. So far, the issue has not been discussed. This matter  is discussed between us and the Israelis in the Taba  negotiations and within the issue of crossings. How the  Palestinians from the West Bank inhabitants can enter. This is  one point. The second is how the inhabitants of Gaza and  Jericho can enter.    The recent clamor was created by the Israeli side and the  Israeli media. This is being done in a systematic, carefully  planned manner because they are perfectly aware of the  seriousness of portraying the issue of Palestinian-Israeli  security coordination at this stage as a fact. This is part of  the psychological war launched by the Israelis to benefit from  confusing us as a Palestinian side to the negotiations. To the  Palestinian mind, the issue of security coordination or  cooperation is very difficult to digest. Moreover, the question  of acceptance and coordination between us and the Israelis does  not exist. We cannot forget that we spent many years in jail.  Our people suffered many years of occupation. But the Israelis  raised this issue in a carefully thought out manner. They  disseminated these false statements. A statement was issued in  my name in one of the Israelis papers in which I was quoted as  saying that there was security coordination between the Israeli  and Palestinian security bodies. This was denied and the denial  was circulated among the Palestinian centers to clarify the  picture and avoid entering into the Israeli labyrinth which will  hinder our progress in the negotiations.    [Abu-Sumayyah] Speaking about the crossings issue, which is  a basic security issue, what is the latest in this regard?    [Dahlan] Discussion of the crossings issue is revolving in  circles and is subject to various opinions. We hope a  breakthrough will be realized in the crossings issue. The  Israeli side wants to supervise the crossings from the  administrative and security viewpoints. We also want  administrative and security supervision. We would like to reach  a compromise on this issue because this portrays the image of  the Palestinian authority. We want the Palestinian citizen to  know that a change has been effected in his life, that a  Palestinian policeman is meeting him, that a Palestinian  policeman is taking care of his administrative papers. We do not  want the Palestinian citizens to face humiliation and oppression  as has been the case in the past. At least we want coordination  in all administrative matters that the Palestinians need on the  crossing points in addition to some aspects of security  measures, entry and departure as well as other issues that  require coordination between us and the Israeli side.    However, the Israeli side has so far been insisting on a  comprehensive security and administrative supervision of the  crossings. Our position is clear and instructions by the  brother president ['Arafat] on this issue are very clear. I do  not think that any Palestinian will accept less than we are  presenting at the negotiations table.    [Abu-Sumayyah] Last question. It has been reported recently  that Israel links the question of releasing Palestinian  detainees with the question of an amnesty by the Palestinians  concerning collaborators with the Israeli authorities. What do  you say to that?    [Dahlan] This question is also connected with the security  coordination which was reported in the Israeli papers. This  issue prompted the Israeli side to disseminate a fabricated  statement attributed to me on the coordination issue. At that  time I dealt with the collaborators. We said that the families  and children of collaborators are Palestinians and we will take  care of them from the social and financial viewpoints and will  treat them just like other Palestinians. However, the issue of  collaborators has always been and will continue to be a very  sensitive subject for us. We are still adhering to our stand  that this issue provokes our people. We will revise the issue of  the agents. Those who deserve to remain among the Palestinians  will be welcomed and we will ask the Israeli side to solve the  problems related to those who do not deserve that. Let them take  them to their areas, in the same way the Netherlands treated  such people.    [Abu-Sumayyah] Thank you very much.</p>

			<p><P> April 10, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TEXAS DEMOCRATS END LURID CAMPAIGN;  </P> <P> POLITICS: ANN RICHARDS OR JIM MATTOX WILL BE THE GUBERNATORIAL NOMINEE AFTER  TODAY'S RUNOFF. IT CAPS POSSIBLY THE DIRTIEST RACE IN STATE HISTORY.  </P> <P> For the last month, Texans have witnessed what is widely regarded as the  dirtiest campaign in the state's history. In Texas, that means it has been  sordid indeed.  </P> <P> At stake in the runoff election today is the Democratic gubernatorial  nomination. Most recently, the two contenders -- state Treasurer Ann Richards  and state Atty. Gen. Jim Mattox -- have dealt in accusations of illegal drug  use, bribery and improper business dealings.  </P> <P> When George Christian, Lyndon B. Johnson's former press secretary and now an  Austin-based political consultant, was going through a receiving line in  Washington the other day, First Lady Barbara Bush asked him if he had ever seen  a worse campaign.  </P> <P> "No, I've never seen one as bad as this," Christian recalled replying.  </P> <P> State Lands Commissioner Garry Mauro said much the same thing Monday: "What a  terrible excuse for a campaign."  </P> <P> Mattox, who has a history of going for his opponent's jugular, is generally  regarded as the candidate who started the campaign on its downward spiral,  although Richards quickly responded once the attacks appeared to be working.  </P> <P> After the March 10 primary, in which Richards and Mattox received 39% and 37%  of the vote, respectively, Mattox began challenging Richards to divulge what  illegal drugs she has used.  </P> <P> In one recent television ad, Mattox insinuates, without proof, that Richards  was a cocaine addict when she was a county commissioner.  </P> <P> "Did she use marijuana? Or something worse, like cocaine?" asks the ad. "Not as  a college kid, but as a 47-year-old elected official sworn to uphold the law."  </P> <P> Richards, a recovering alcoholic, has refused to discuss the matter, except to  say that she has not used any "mood-altering chemicals" in the last 10 years.  </P> <P> She retaliated by running campaign ads pointing to Mattox's 1983 indictment on  bribery charges, without including the fact that he was acquitted. She also  questioned Mattox's business dealings, as well as loans received, but without  offering proof that anything was amiss.  </P> <P> Few expected her to stay above the fray. So scathing was her attack on former  Gov. Mark White before the March primary election that he vowed never to  support her and compared her to a Nazi. "What Ann Richards has done would make  Himmler blush," said White, referring to Gestapo leader Heinrich Himmler.  </P> <P> The heat has been turned up dramatically in the last several days after reports  surfaced in the media that Mattox had smoked marijuana while a state  representative in the early '70s. Mattox vehemently denied the reports and  accused the Richards camp of Watergate-style "dirty tricks" in spreading  stories of drug use.  </P> <P> On Sunday, he said that Richards had been treated for cocaine addiction 10  years ago. Richards responded by calling Mattox a "desperate man."  </P> <P> At the same time, the race has been basically devoid of any substantive issues.  All this, said Christian, has caused him to watch in "horrified fascination."  </P> <P> A poll published Sunday in the Houston Chronicle placed Richards six points  ahead of Mattox, with a four-point margin of error.  </P> <P> Despite the mean-spirited atmosphere to the race, there is a lot riding on the  Texas gubernatorial election, both on a state and national level. Texas will be  a major player in reapportionment after the 1990 census because the state is  expected to score gains in the number of congressional seats. The party that  holds the governor's office will be able to have a major influence on how the  congressional districts are apportioned.  </P> <P> Whoever wins in today's voting will still have a considerable task ahead in  defeating Republican businessman Clayton Williams. Williams would have been a  prohibitive favorite over either Richards or Mattox, but he told a tasteless  joke that has opened the door a bit for the eventual Democratic nominee.  Williams said ugly weather is like rape -- "if it's inevitable, just relax and  enjoy it." He later said his remark was "insensitive."  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: SANTA MONICA  </P> <P> Ironically, Donald Lipski's large untitled assemblage begins to breed life from  industrial materials. A mammoth braid of nylon rope tied like a pony tail  strongly suggests a sperm; a long glass pipe filled with water and pink rubber  bands looks like intestines clogged with worms; a hovering steel-wool blimp  high on the gallery wall recalls a strangely mechanical deep sea sponge.  </P> <P> Lipski's artistic forays as a mad scientist have the spark of life, but lead a  curiously tense existence. His female-shaped bass cello case with red fluid in  its belly is suspended by a bail picker like a prisoner of the Inquisition. His  two white, steel pylons bolted to big chunks of wood put a vise grip on the  verdant book titled "Meat Under the Microscope"; they have enough aerobic  pressure to make the whitewashed wood look flush with fresh blood.  </P> <P> Biological allusions are frequently subtle: as much due to the weird visual  logic created by the assemblage as to the hardware the artist uses. Pieces give  the gallery the feel of an underwater junkyard where derelict devices have  combined via spontaneous generation. Human Angst seems to have been genetically  imprinted on these things when they were originally machined and Lipski  unleashes it effortlessly with the assembly. Ultimately, that gives the work a  biting cynicism. (Dorothy Goldeen Gallery, 1547 9th St., to Dec. 30.) SUVAN  GEER  </P></p>

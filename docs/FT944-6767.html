			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Equity Markets: Oslo - Other Markets Norway goes to the polls today to decide on membership of the European Union, but the market has its supporters, even if, as last week's increasingly close polls suggested, the electorate rejects the idea. Goldman Sachs forecasts that share prices could rise by 15 to 20 per cent in the coming year, even with a 'no' vote. 'If Norway were to join the EU, we think the market could offer a somewhat higher return of 20 to 25 per cent,' the investment bank said. Its favoured stocks include Norske Skog, Norsk Hydro, Bergesen, Kvaerner and Orkla. 'Given relatively strong fundamentals and attractive relative valuation, we regard any significant downturn in the near future as a good buying opportunity,' Goldman said. It based its stance on favourable macroeconomic prospects and a strong earnings growth outlook.</p>

			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / International Company News: Japanese 'mini-bubble' set to catch a train - A rail group is about to test the strength of Tokyo's rebound THE rebound of the Tokyo stock market, already termed by some investors as the 'mini bubble', spells relief for the Japanese government, forced over the past two years to postpone floating off its holdings in Japanese companies by falling share prices. This week, the government is due to decide to go ahead with the listing of East Japan Railway (JR East), one of the seven regional companies created in 1987 by the break-up of Japan National Railways (JNR), the national railway operator. JNR was split up in order to tackle its mounting losses resulting from inefficient operations and rising debt. A government-owned company, JNR Settlement Corp, was set up to hold the shares in the resulting six passenger companies and one freight company, thereby removing them from direct government control, but not government ownership. JR East is ready to file a preliminary application to the Tokyo stock exchange for a listing in October. Half of the company's 4m shares are expected to be offered in the first tranche, with 500,000 shares to be auctioned. JNR Settlement needs to sell the shares to raise funds to reduce JR East's mounting debt. Initially, the holding company had planned to reduce the debt by selling railway property. However, the government introduced restrictions on land sales in the 1980s after a sharp rise of Japanese property prices prompted fears that railway company land sales would fuel the surge in property prices. Meanwhile, Japanese stockbrokers are eager to promote JR East shares, hoping that low-priced stock will bring retail investors back to the market. A recent survey by Okasan Economic Research Institute, the research arm of Okasan Securities, a second-tier Japanese broker, showed that 66 per cent of 1,200 investors surveyed were interested in buying JR East shares. At the same time, an 82 per cent surge so far this year in the share price of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT), the privatised telecommunications group in which the government still holds a 65.7 per cent stake, has helped lift retail investor confidence. The earlier plunge in NTT shares, the most widely held stock in Japan, disillusioned individual investors and sparked distrust in the government which sold the NTT shares at a high price. Last August, the NTT stock had fallen 80 per cent from its peak, prompting the government to postpone offering additional tranches in NTT shares as well as the listing of JR East. Although some investors are still cautious, the recovery in NTT shares has set the stage for the JR East listing. Japanese brokers have already embraced the flotation and are promoting companies related to the JR group, such as rolling stock manufacturers and railway construction companies as a new 'theme' for the stock market. According to the Okasan survey, investors said they were willing to buy the shares if they were priced at about Y200,000 each. A figure now mooted in the Japanese press is Y250,000, which, if JR East decides to maintain its previous year's dividend of Y5,000 a share, would mean the stock would yield 2 per cent. 'As a stock it's good value,' says Mr Graeme McDonald, analyst at James Capel in Tokyo. However, the company is unlikely to grow quickly, and is expected to be burdened by heavy capital expenditure for the 1998 Olympics in Nagano. The company reported a 0.9 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Y109bn (Dollars 956.14m) for its last financial year and estimates pre-tax profits will fall 7.1 per cent for the current year to March 1994. Moreover, unlike other private railway companies that have diversified into land development and retail businesses, JR East has only its railways operations to rely on. Ms Kumiko Takase, analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in Tokyo, says: 'JR has nothing to fall back on when the railway business does badly.' The Tokyo stock market has rebounded on government support measures, the recovery in NTT's share price, an increase in liquidity due to low interest rates, and the release of positive economic news. Since the outcome of JR East's listing will decide the fate of other semi-privatised corporations - such as Japan Tobacco, and the remaining Japanese railway companies - government officials are keeping their fingers crossed that the 'mini bubble' does not burst before October.</p>

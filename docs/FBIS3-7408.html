			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 25 KYODO -- Coca-Cola (Japan) Co.  said Friday [25 March] it has been accused of failing to  declare a total of about 37 billion yen in income from 1990  through 1992 but that it will appeal the assessment.    Japan's National Tax Administration Agency claims Coca-Cola  (Japan) failed to report income gained in Japan and, instead,  paid the income to its parent firm, the Coca-Cola Co., as  royalties, the firm said.    The tax agency claims the royalties paid by Coca-Cola  (Japan)  to its parent firm over three years were higher than usual, the  firm said.    It has imposed an additional tax of about 15 billion yen on  Coca- Cola (Japan), the firm said.    Coca-Cola (Japan) issued a statement saying it is  dissatisfied with the assessment and will seek consultations  between the Governments of the United States and Japan. "The  matter will now be reviewed by the United States and Japanese  tax authorities under the treaty signed by the two nations to  prevent double taxation," the statement said.    "The royalties we pay are fair and reasonable given the  unmatched value of Coca-Cola Co.'s trademarks, manufacturing,  marketing and know-how," said Roi Suzuki, executive vice  president and director of Coca-Cola (Japan).    "In the 40 years we have operated in Japan, we have always  paid our taxes in full and in strict compliance with Japanese  laws. In fact, Coca-Cola (Japan) Co. is today the single  largest taxpayer among foreign affiliated companies in the  country," he said.    Coca-Cola (Japan), founded in 1957, is financed entirely by  Coca-Cola Export Co. and has a 35 percent share in Japan's soft  drink industry. It declared 49.4 billion yen in income to  Japanese tax authorities in December 1992.</p>

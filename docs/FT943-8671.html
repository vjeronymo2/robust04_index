			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Argos It is clear from yesterday's interim figures that Argos started to run out of steam some time in the spring. The rate of like-for-like sales growth was around 9 per cent until the end of April but fell to little more than 1 per cent during May and June. Although 6.7 per cent for the six months as a whole is perfectly respectable, the worry must be that Argos has lost momentum going into the more important second half of the year. Tax increases which came into effect in April must take part of the blame for the slowdown, even though official retail sales figures did not show a steep decline. Argos's strength in areas such as electrical appliances may have made it more vulnerable to consumer caution than many other retailers. As confidence returns this mix of business could work in its favour. After such a strong start to the year the company also ran out of catalogues earlier than expected. The early indications are that the new catalogue is performing well. By holding its selling prices on 80 per cent of its goods, Argos appears to have lost none of its competitive edge. Even if the early summer doldrums were an aberration, though, Argos will have to work hard to improve on strong sales figures achieved in the second half of last year. Its store opening programme has moved up a gear this year and has several years left to run. But new stores alone can not sustain the kind of growth the stock market is looking for. With cash still accumulating and no sign of a strategic move, it will be difficult for the shares to move ahead without evidence that sales momentum has been restored.</p>

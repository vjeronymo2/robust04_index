			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / Accountancy: Bright outlook forecast, but not guaranteed - The new rules on 'going concern' statements which make explicit their judgments Making a statement that a business is a going concern should be viewed in the same way as a weather forecast. It is a judgment based on available data at a point in time. It is not a guarantee of fair weather. No one would think of suing a weather forecaster after a holiday ruined by rain. However, we might be justifiably annoyed by a 24-hour forecast which failed to notice the approach of a typhoon. The problem with the concept of going concern is that it is seen by many shareholders and investors as providing a guarantee against collapse. When things go badly wrong they feel aggrieved. The late 1980s provided a string of examples of company collapses within months of the publication of accounts, audited without qualification, and containing the assumption that the company was a going concern. Creditors sought to apportion blame and turned to the auditors. The situation cruelly exposed an 'expectation gap'. If the company concerned was a going concern eight months ago why was it now revealed to be nothing of the sort? What had the auditor missed? What had the directors failed to tell the auditor? This week the Audit Practice Board, and the Working Group on Going Concern, with members from the Institute of Chartered Accountants, the Hundred Group, and the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Scotland, have between them attempted to clarify the responsibilities of auditors and directors with respect to going concern. Their work is a direct response to the corporate failures of the 1980s. Both have been keen to make plain what going concern is not. It is not a cast iron prediction. It is a judgment made on the available evidence at a point in time. That judgment is based on the information provided by the directors. It is not a guarantee the company will continue to trade. What going concern is has become much clearer this week and the APB and the working group deserve credit for co-ordinating their findings and coming up with a practical framework. The only danger is that they may have difficulty in restraining public expectations in the future. The APB's Statement of Auditing Standards (SAS) 130 replaces the old auditing guideline which was widely criticised for giving the auditor a passive role on going concern. Unless the auditor literally fell over contrary evidence the business was presumed to be a going concern. SAS 130, which covers all audited companies, requires the auditor to take a pro-active role and to consider, rigorously, a business's ability to continue as a going concern. That ability should extend into the 'foreseeable future' - which is not strictly defined. However, if directors of the company in question consider a period of less than one year from the date of the approval of the financial statements and do not disclose it, the auditors must record this in their basis of opinion. This subtlety can be seen as the APB watering down the rigor of the standard or introducing a practical recognition that some businesses, such as a fashion house faced with an unpredictable spring season, might not be able to provide the detail required for such a period. The auditors, under SAS 130, should qualify their opinion if they think the directors have not backed up their assertion of going concern with adequate information. The auditors should register an adverse opinion if they disagree with the assertion. Michael Boyd, chairman of the task force that produced the standard is sure it will not create a 'make work' project for companies. It is not mandatory for companies to provide cash flow forecasts or budgets to back up going concern. For many companies no extra work will be needed. The standard is effective from June 30 1995 although the APB wants it adopted when those companies being audited already comply with the Cadbury Code - under which directors are already urged to make a statement of going concern. What the APB has done for auditors, the Working Group on Going Concern has done for company directors of listed companies - including those quoted on the USM. It has published this week guidance on making an explicit statement of going concern. As its guidance is a codification of best practice with which it believes companies with year ends from December 1994 can comply. The guidelines give directors three options: To state that the company is a going concern. To state it is a going concern but with an explanation of potential problems and how they would be dealt with. To state that the business is not a going concern. Needless to say the final option is going to be rare. The second will not be as rare and will need very careful handling if it is not going to inflict severe damage on the share price. In the case, for example, of an incomplete negotiation of a contract, analysts and the press would need to be carefully briefed. Advice to directors on the definition of 'foreseeable future' has again been dovetailed with the APB's rules for auditors. Generally they should look at all the relevant information available - including the long-term view. The expiry of a patent, for example, in 15 years' time is not an irrelevant item for consideration. One can see some potential problems when the new rules are up and running. Imagine a group of directors putting forward their judgment that the company is a going concern based upon a forthcoming bank loan. The auditor may discover, after questioning the directors, that the loan is only to be forthcoming if the company is judged a going concern. This kind of situation will require a common sense solution. One could imagine a tripartite meeting between the parties involved as a good start. Finally the APB also published this week a revised bulletin on corporate governance which said that it was impractical for auditors to give an opinion on the director's report on going concern. This was seen as involving too much extra work. However, if the director's report is inconsistent with what the auditor knows from having to sign off the accounts then they should highlight the difference. Taken together this week's publications certainly appear to increase the responsibilities of auditors and directors. By clearly setting out their duties and roles the APB and the working group have put in place a strong framework. There may be some fears that as a result the liability of auditors has been increased. This is certainly a danger. But the allocation of responsibility between the parties has also made it clear that auditors have to work with information provided by directors. The rules now also make it explicit that the going concern judgment is not a guarantee of future prosperity. If auditors can educate the public on this definition of going concern it will go a long way to closing the expectation gap and protecting them from blame when companies fail. The need for more open discussion and analysis in financial statements of going concern should also benefit the public interest. For most company directors the new rules will not be a burden. But the guidelines undoubtedly focus their responsibilities in a way which is difficult to avoid. There will be those who do not wish to take a more rigorous approach to what has up until now been seen as a bland assumption.</p>

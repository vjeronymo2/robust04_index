			<p><P> February 20, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> CHRISTIAN SCIENCE RIFT;  </P> <P> HIGH-TECH HERESY AT THE MONITOR?  </P> <P> Newspapers by nature are the kind of thing people take personally. Just ask any  editor about the irate phone calls that pour in after each decision to drop a  comic strip.  </P> <P> Now imagine if someone makes sweeping changes in a newspaper that is literally  a religious mission, changes that provoke a debate about the very foundation of  the religion.  </P> <P> That, in short, explains how events at the Christian Science Monitor have  become the vortex of a crisis of faith at the First Church of Christ,  Scientist, the small, 110-year-old religious sect based in Boston and known  largely for embracing spiritual healing and for publishing its venerable  newspaper.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Full-Color Version  </P> <P> In November, the three top editors of the Monitor resigned, charging that the  church's expansion into television and radio broadcasting was threatening the  future of the 80-year-old journal. Last month, the church introduced a much  smaller, full-color Monitor in a year when it was spending at least $65 million  on radio, television and magazines.  </P> <P> But confidential church documents, videotapes, financial data and interviews  reveal that the story goes far deeper. Some members of the church are  convinced, based on these documents, that the church management secretly  planned to eliminate the deficit-ridden newspaper in favor of building an  electronic media empire that would attract new members.  </P> <P> Church officials say such charges misstate their intentions. And they have  lashed out against the critics, accusing one of undermining "the efforts of  present management to achieve a profit through greater efficiency."  </P> <P> Yet some church members worry that, even if it is moving in the right  direction, the leadership is endangering the church's future financially by its  attempts to rapidly build a full-spectrum media empire.  </P> <P> </P> <P> More Troubling Question  </P> <P> And at its heart, the debate involves a more troubling question that transcends  Christian Science: Is the quality of ideas and discourse being fundamentally  debased in a world dominated by television?  </P> <P> As renowned church scholar Robert Peel put it last year in a book: "Will  Christian Scientists put their whole heart and soul into strengthening the  church's healing mission through deeper individual spirituality and commitment?  Or will the organization pour its faith, funds and energy into extending  electronically a watered-down version of the original message?"  </P> <P> Launched by church founder Mary Baker Eddy in 1908, the Monitor has always been  a curious mix of journalism, religion and business. Through quality news  gathering, it was supposed to fulfill the church mission of helping society and  of keeping the flock from becoming too insular, its profits to accrue to the  church. Today, the debate over the Monitor is largely one about which of these  three values should predominate.  </P> <P> Over the years, the Monitor's reputation swelled; it regularly made lists of  the country's 10 best newspapers, admired for its determinedly objective  reporting and broad coverage of national and international developments. In so  doing, it also helped become a source of pride that kept the tiny sect from  being dismissed as a cult.  </P> <P> Until 1961, it even turned a profit. Then, as national advertising drifted to  television, the Monitor's losses built up, totaling $166 million between 1970  and 1987, according to confidential church documents provided to The Times by  numerous sources.  </P> <P> At the same time, officials did not quarrel with published reports that church  membership was dwindling, the number of churches dropping by nearly 20% in two  decades. Though the church no longer releases figures, membership was 269,000  in 1936 and is thought to be lower now.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Worldwide Video  </P> <P> To rejuvenate the church, its governing board of directors in 1984 conducted a  worldwide video conference called "To Live for All Mankind," in which it called  on members to focus less on individual and church problems and more on those of  the outside world.  </P> <P> To rejuvenate the paper, the church in the early 1980s hired as manager John H.  Hoagland Jr., a business consultant and church member, and as editor Katherine  Fanning, one of the most prominent Christian Science journalists in the  country. And the paper improved, in both areas.  </P> <P> But by 1985, the Monitor was still losing $16 million a year, its circulation  mired near 150,000, down from a high of 170,000 in the 1950s, and Hoagland  decided that the paper could not be made profitable.  </P> <P> Everyone agreed that changes were needed. The question was how to make them.  </P> <P> Hoagland, with the backing of Harvey Wood, the senior member of the board of  directors, increasingly began talking about the Monitor as a "concept" or "a  complete system" of communication rather than simply as the newspaper Eddy had  founded.  </P> <P> "It would be foolish to argue that TV is not the medium on which most people  depend," Hoagland said in an interview. To stay "abreast of the times," he  said, echoing the church's governing manual, the church needed to understand  how modern communication worked.  </P> <P> Generally, people now get news from radio, a visual and emotional sense of the  world from TV and a sense of how to interpret events from print, Hoagland said.  </P> <P> In private sessions with church leaders, Hoagland argued that the church's  publishing society, which also produces its religious literature, could turn a  profit and reach a wider audience through radio and television. The church  elders were persuaded.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Weekend Show  </P> <P> They began a weekend radio news show in 1984 on public radio, which went  nightly in 1985. They started a monthly TV news program in 1985, and in 1986  bought television Channel 68 in Boston, on which eventually they would spend an  estimated $31 million.  </P> <P> And the move toward electronic news gathering was mirrored by changes on the  religious side. The same year they bought Channel 68, church directors  conducted another worldwide video conference, this one called "Global Lecture  Preparatory Meeting." In it, elder Wood argued that members had "been speaking  largely to themselves . . . in formats that were outdated."  </P> <P> The acquisitions and the rhetoric were spawning a debate inside the church:  Could television carry on the church mission of quality journalism?  </P> <P> "The obverse weakness of a medium (television) that inherently treats the  evidence of the eyes as decisive reality . . . is that it tends to be facile  and superficial and to sacrifice . . . the very qualities that have given  Monitor journalism its reputation," Bonn correspondent Elizabeth Pond would  write three years later, when she resigned from the paper.  </P> <P> While the argument continued, the strategy accelerated. The church launched a  shortwave radio service in 1987, airing news and religious broadcasts overseas.  It will cost $11 million to run this year, excluding $20 million in  construction costs.  </P> <P> Also last year, the church added a slick monthly magazine and what Hoagland in  confidential church documents has described as a crucial element, a nightly TV  news program, "World Monitor," hosted by former network correspondent John  Hart.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Affluent Readers  </P> <P> The program, which airs nightly on cable's Discovery Channel, resembles ABC's  "Nightline" -- mixing taped reports and conversations with experts -- but  touches on more than one subject, usually international affairs, each night. It  will cost at least $20 million to produce each year, church officials said, not  including acquiring equipment and building facilities, and so far has a limited  audience.  </P> <P> The monthly World Monitor magazine, meanwhile, is aimed at younger and more  affluent readers than the five-day-a-week Monitor newspaper, according to  editor Earl Foell, and will make heavy use of expert authors rather than simply  journalists. It will cost $7 million to operate next year.  </P> <P> The figures have alarmed some church members. A "dizzying rush into electronic  media," Monitor Washington Bureau Chief Charlotte Saikowski called it upon  resigning. And frankly, some wonder if the expansion is so rapid and expensive  that the church is risking financial ruin.  </P> <P> In the current fiscal year alone, the magazine, shortwave and TV ventures will  cost the church between $65 million and $75 million. To pay for it, the church  over the last three years will have liquidated nearly two-thirds of its  unrestricted pool of funds, from $167 million to about $60 million by next May.  </P> <P> In a memo, federal judge and prominent church member Thomas Griesa wrote that  "the church's financial condition (now) is extremely difficult" and "this  situation is caused by expanding much too fast into a number of very  speculative endeavors."  </P> <P> Church Treasurer Donald C. Bowersock adamantly disagrees. He said that Griesa  and others forget that $20 million to $25 million of this year's broadcasting  expenses are capital investments, which won't be needed again.  </P> <P> Yet the seeming speed of the expansion has left some wondering whether the  church officials were hoping that the media strategy would divert attention  from the church's internal problems and perhaps woo new members -- as if "they  see TV as a magical tool that can renew the church," as one young former  Monitor reporter and church member put it, requesting anonymity.  </P> <P> Not so, said John Selover, chairman of the church directors. "The survival of  the church is far more attuned to how much good it can do than to how many  members there are."  </P> <P> Nor by Selover's reckoning, are the moves high risk. "I don't want to be blue  sky, but . . . to love God and love our neighbor as ourselves, those words have  motivated this whole thing and they have never been bankrupt and never would,"  he said in an interview.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Suspicion, Intrigue  </P> <P> But as time progressed, suspicion and intrigue at church headquarters clouded  the philosophical and financial arguments, and eventually two camps emerged.  And at the center of it was the belief by one that management wanted to kill  off the money-losing Monitor -- an act church management in interviews called  "unthinkable."  </P> <P> Critics turn to internal documents to support their argument that management  wanted to shut down the paper. In a confidential five-year plan in 1985, for  instance, Hoagland outlined five "probable scenarios" for the future of the  church's media, three of which involved eliminating the Monitor. One option --  a weekly paper and various broadcasting efforts -- "may well be the best  overall plan," the document reads.  </P> <P> The next year, church management prepared a letter for members announcing that  the publishing society would introduce a weekly paper into the United States  and dramatically raise the price of the daily, from $140 a year to about $200.  </P> <P> To editor Fanning and others, the letter was a further step in a plan to kill  the Monitor. Not only did they believe that the weekly and daily would weaken  each other by competing in the same market, but they had never been informed  that management had indeed considered this course.  </P> <P> Fanning and Managing Editor David Anable threatened to resign unless management  made some commitment to the daily paper in the letter and described plans for  the weekly as tentative, according to Anable.  </P> <P> The letter was changed, but the flame of distrust was not extinguished.  </P> <P> In August, 1987, Hoagland conducted an all-day meeting on the future of church  media with the publishing society board of trustees, which runs the church  media under the auspices of the church's overall board of directors.  </P> <P> Fanning and her deputies were not included, in fact not even formally notified  that the meeting had taken place until two months later, after the board of  trustees and board of directors had formally approved its findings.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Financial Promise  </P> <P> According to a videotape of that session and more than 100 pages of documents  obtained by The Times, Hoagland saw great financial promise in broadcasting,  none in the daily newspaper. He also presented two budgets -- a traditional one  with all media continuing, and an "alternate" in which only shortwave and a  proposed daily TV news program remained. Gone were all other news efforts,  including the Monitor.  </P> <P> "We would recommend the alternate that we've shown here," Hoagland says on the  videotape.  </P> <P> Many who have seen the tape view it as further proof that management wanted to  kill the paper.  </P> <P> Treasurer Bowersock, then chairman of the trustees, said that the presentation  was designed "to get the board's attention," rather than as a literal  recommendation. "He was running it up the flag pole to see what would happen,"  and people said no.  </P> <P> Hoagland and other board members also insist that they never planned to kill  the Monitor, which Hoagland contended "will be here forever." But "to deny the  ability of management to say those issues and to say them out loud would be to  deny management its integrity," he said.  </P> <P> And indeed, while the trustees and later the directors endorsed Hoagland's  "direction and emphasis," according to church documents, the alternate plan has  not been followed.  </P> <P> But sometime in the fall of 1987, Fanning told managing editor Anable and  others that Hoagland had informed her the Monitor would shut down for good in  the spring of 1989. Hoagland flatly denies that. Fanning, traveling in Asia,  could not be reached for this article.  </P> <P> Fanning spent most of 1988 heading a task force to redesign the Monitor and cut  the paper's annual deficit to about $10 million. She presented her findings in  October, but the board rejected them, choosing instead a plan by Richard A.  Nenneman, a member of Hoagland's management team. That plan proposed changing  the Monitor even more radically, eliminating advertising, cutting staff  substantially and reducing the number of pages from an average of 32 per issue  to 16.  </P> <P> But according to church documents, long before either prototype could be begun,  the board had set on a course that it knew would force Fanning out.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Staff Reorganization  </P> <P> In 1987, Hoagland had recommended a staff reorganization, in which the Monitor  would share its news bureaus with the church's TV and radio divisions. A new  editor in chief, ranking above Fanning, would coordinate the effort. According  to Wood, the senior director of the church, the board knew that Fanning  disliked the plan. She argued that the Monitor should take precedence over the  more speculative TV and radio ventures.  </P> <P> "We knew the moment we made that decision for that organizational change, Kay  would not stay," Wood told the paper's Washington bureau after Fanning  resigned, according to a transcript of that meeting.  </P> <P> What the board did not expect was that managing editor Anable, his deputy,  David Winder, and many of the Monitor's best known and most talented staff  members also would resign.  </P> <P> Amid the crisis, the church made rapid changes in the new Monitor from  Nenneman's prototype. It went back up to 20 pages and included two pages of  advertising. And, most significantly, the paper added full color.  </P> <P> But the move to color forced another change that drove even more people to  resign and has drastically altered the character of the newspaper. To print and  distribute the paper on time, most stories in the Monitor now must be completed  and edited two days before most readers will read the paper.  </P> <P> "The Monitor has lost its purpose, identity and direction," one editor said in  his resignation letter. One joke now calls the paper "USA Yesterday."  </P> <P> Nenneman and Hoagland, however, argue that their reader surveys show that  people no longer read the Monitor for breaking news but for interpretation of  longer term international and national events. In effect, they argue, the paper  is streamlining to focus on its strengths.  </P> <P> But even some at the Monitor who believe Nenneman and Hoagland said privately  that they fear that, once reporters are removed from gathering news, their  ability to analyze and interpret it is greatly diminished.  </P> <P> And the critics also wonder whether the Monitor can maintain its quality with a  staff drastically cut back, from 170 to about 110, with some of those remaining  now sharing their responsibilities with radio and television.  </P> <P> In the end, it may come down to what extent the Monitor is viewed as a business  and not simply as a mission.  </P> <P> "The logic of Christian Science demands that an ailing church be treated as an  ailing patient would be -- with total commitment to spiritual ways and means,  not human skills and repairs," wrote scholar Peel.  </P> <P> The Monitor is a mission and a business both, argues management. As Hoagland  once put it to church officials in a report, "A sense of order and of integrity  (is derived) . . . through its requirement to be a business enterprise."  </P> <P> </P> <P> CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MEDIA EMPIRE  </P> <P> REDESIGN -- The 80-year-old Monitor changed its format last month, including  use of full-color pictures.  </P> <P> FINANCIAL RESULTS -- Operating revenues of the company.  </P> <TABLE CWL="3.76IN:2.99IN:2.55IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="3"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Fiscal 1988  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Fiscal 1989  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> (ending April 30)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> (estimated)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Channel 68 and syndicate  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $7.2 million  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $9.8 million  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Shortwave radio  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $7.2 million  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $10.8 million  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Monitor newspaper  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $19.1 million  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $16.5 million  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Monitor magazine  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $2 million  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $7 million  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Radio (broadcast)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $4.8 million  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $4 million  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> TV  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $11.3 million  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $17 million  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Religious magazines  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $1 million  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 0  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P> <P> * The church also spent $9 million in 1988 and another $21 million in 1989 in  capital expenditures in the building of the shortwave facilities.  </P> <P> SOURCE: Church figures and church member Thomas Griesa  </P></p>

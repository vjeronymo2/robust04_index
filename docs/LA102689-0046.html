			<p><P> October 26, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CHARGERS READYING TOLLIVER FOR START AGAINST SEAHAWKS  </P> <P> Billy Joe Tolliver got the good news Wednesday morning, and he wasn't  surprised.  </P> <P> "I had hints," said Tolliver, the Chargers' rookie quarterback from Texas Tech.  "I read the papers. I'm not like some guys. I spend a quarter."  </P> <P> Coach Dan Henning ended two days of speculation when he named Tolliver to  replace Jim McMahon for the Chargers against the Seahawks Sunday in Seattle.  Tolliver, activated last week after spending the first six weeks of the season  on injured reserve with a broken collarbone, will be making his regular season  debut in the National Football League.  </P> <P> Henning announced Tolliver's promotion with a somewhat cryptic statement that  left the door slightly open for him to change his mind.  </P> <P> "We're practicing Tolliver to get him ready to start," Henning said. "If I  think he's ready to start, he will. If I don't, we'll start McMahon, but I have  a feeling we'll start Tolliver and try to keep the situation status quo and get  a little better. If that's not the case, we'll go back to McMahon."  </P> <P> McMahon has a sore left shoulder and has been ineffective in recent games, but  Henning wouldn't say whether either factor had led to the decision to start  Tolliver.  </P> <P> Asked why he had made the change, Henning said, "Because I think it's prudent  at this time to see what Billy Joe can do. Our collective group of offensive  players have not been as productive as we'd like them to be."  </P> <P> Veteran David Archer had been the No. 2 all season. Asked why he had been  bypassed, Henning said, "That's a question I decided to think about and won't  discuss with anybody."  </P> <P> Asked if this meant he hadn't consulted Ted Tollner, the quarterbacks coach,  about the change, Henning said, "I consult with all of my position coaches  about such matters."  </P> <P> Pressed at that point to explain his statement about Archer, the coach said, "I  will decide that answer within myself."  </P> <P> Tolliver, who didn't work out with the team until a week ago, said, "I know  it's not going to be easy, but I'd like to know where my career is at. I have a  good feeling. I like my chances of doing well."  </P> <P> Henning's original plan was to bring Tolliver along slowly, but with McMahon  struggling and the Chargers in the AFC West cellar at 2-5, he advanced his  timetable.  </P> <P> "It's just something that happened," Tolliver said. "I'm not going to go crazy  about it.  </P> <P> "There are some feelings going around as far as other guys wanting to play. You  know Jim. He wants to be in there, and if he was healthy, he would be. David  wants to play, too, but what am I going to do? If they tell me to play, I'll  play.  </P> <P> "Let's not paint a different picture here. If I stink the joint up, they won't  hesitate to put in somebody else."  </P> <P> Tolliver took all but seven snaps in Wednesday's workout. McMahon took the  remainder, and Archer watched.  </P> <P> Afterward, Tolliver said, "My timing was all right, and my arm felt good.  However, there were three plays I blew by translating signals wrong."  </P> <P> A disappointed Archer said, "It doesn't say that much for me, that's for sure.  I've just got to try to help Billy Joe the best I can."  </P> <P> Asked if he now considered himself No. 3, Archer said, "That's the way it  looks. But they're the decision-makers, and I'm the player."  </P> <P> McMahon didn't want to talk about it. His brief press conference went this way:  </P> <P> Question: There are indications of a change at quarterback. Are you receptive?  </P> <P> Answer: I just do what they tell me, man.  </P> <P> Q: Do you have any opinion on it?  </P> <P> A: No.  </P> <P> Q: Do you feel that you need a rest?  </P> <P> A: I just do what they tell me.  </P> <P> Q: How do you gauge the way you have played?  </P> <P> A: Just pretend I snuck out. I didn't even see you here.  </P> <P> Q: Well, how would you gauge the way you have played?  </P> <P> A: Just pretend I snuck out.  </P> <P> Q: How do you feel about the possibility of being taken out of the lineup?  </P> <P> A: I feel like it's lunch time.  </P> <P> Q: This is Wednesday. Isn't this the day you're supposed to talk?  </P> <P> A: You've got everything out of me you're going to get.  </P> <P> With that, McMahon picked up the attache case in which he carries his lunch and  walked away.  </P> <P> Charger Notes  </P> <P> Running back Dana Brinson was omitted from the Chargers' injury report despite  the fact that he missed last Sunday's game and still has a right shoulder that  is so sore he left Wednesday's workout early. The list included H-back Rod  Bernstine (knee), doubtful; offensive tackle Joel Patten (knee and back),  questionable, and quarterback Jim McMahon (shoulder), running back Marion Butts  (knee), linebacker Jim Collins (back) and defensive end Burt Grossman (knee),  probable. Two others were hurt after the list was turned in -- cornerback Sammy  Seale (shoulder) and offensive tackle Joey Howard (ankle). . . . The Seahawks  listed four players as probable -- offensive tackle Ron Mattes (thigh),  linebacker M.L. Johnson (eye), linebacker Darrin Miller (back) and linebacker  Tony Woods (leg). . . . Charger offensive tackle Brett Miller is a new father.  His wife, Gailyn, gave birth Monday to a seven-pound girl, Giana Lynette.  Quarterback Billy Joe Tolliver said of Miller, "He was shining so bright after  that baby was born that I didn't see anything else on the right side of the  line."  </P></p>

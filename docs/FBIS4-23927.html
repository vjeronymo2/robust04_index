			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report]  <H8>  SUNDAY TIMES </H8>   Putting Domestic Problems First -- "As the facade of  Nationalist power is stripped away," weekly revelations show how  "South Africa subsided into the parlous condition which now  confronts the government"; "islands of privilege have been  preserved for officialdom in the sea of poverty that covers most  of South Africa," notes an editorial in Johannesburg SUNDAY  TIMES in English on 19 June on page 22. "If the waste and  corruption can be eliminated, the cost of government can surely  be reduced, and resources may be diverted to meet the more  urgent needs of the people." "Next week's budget will be heavily  burdened by the profligate mismanagement of the past. Vested  interests -- civil servants in Pretoria, bantustan  bureaucracies, the armed forces, the armaments industry, the  artsy- craftsy establishment -- that grew fat in the imperial  years" are fighting "to preserve such elements of the old system  that can be snatched from the revolution." Internationally "it  does not seem possible even to explain to foreigners that the  Nationalists have left South Africa very largely a run-down  slum." While South Africa has an interest here, it "cannot carry  this continent, and it serves Africa best by working toward its  own restoration." "The first, overriding need is to restore our  economy to health; the second is to attend to the needs of our  own people; after that, we may lift our eyes to a wider horizon."  <H8>  RAPPORT </H8>   Pressure on Finance Minister--"When Minister Derek Keys  delivers his budget speech on Wednesday he will be closely  watched to a greater extent than he or his predecessors have  ever experienced," begins a page-20 editorial in Afrikaans in  the Johannesburg RAPPORT on 19 June. "Not only is he acting as  minister of a government of national unity, of whom the main  role player, the ANC, has a controversial economic policy, but  he will have to find some balance between what is expected and  what is possible. On the one hand, he will have to try to boost  the struggling economy -- a task that has given several of his  overseas counterparts sleepless nights during a worldwide  recession. On the other hand he will have to find considerable  sums of money to finance the reconstruction program." "The  ambitious Reconstruction and Development Program will result in  higher state spending." "The promised large numbers of houses,  schools, and hospitals to be built through increased taxation  could have a far reaching negative effect on the economy, which  could in turn affect both rich and poor alike. If extreme  caution is not applied the internal demand for imported goods  will rise, followed by a drop in foreign exchange reserves, a  further weakening of the exchange rate, higher inflation, and  increased wage demands by unions." "Mr. Keys only has one way  of narrowing the economic gap: He will have to ensure economic  growth. South African products will have to be more competitive  in foreign markets so that it can expand its exports in order to  build up its foreign exchange reserves."  <H8>  SOWETAN </H8>   Petrol Price Increase -- "The consumer is again left  wondering about the truth behind last week's increase in the  price of petrol. The Government, now composed of some of the  people who were very loud in their opposition to the last hike,  tells us that the increase was unavoidable," notes an editorial  in Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 20 June on page 8. "What  then confuses us is the Government's attack on people who say  they can continue selling petrol at the old price," surely "the  Government should be wishing them good luck and ignoring them."  Energy Affairs Minister Botha's "argument that deregulation must  be introduced in an orderly way, sounds too much like old  National Party language."  <H8>  BUSINESS DAY </H8>   Public Broadcasting -- "The SABC's [South African  Broadcasting Corporation] suggestion to the Independent  Broadcasting Authority that it be funded by taxation rather than  by licence fees has merit, but only if it is introduced as part  of a total change to the country's broadcasting industry and to  the management of public broadcasting," notes an editorial in  Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 20 June on page 4.  "Under the present ANC-led government, the public broadcaster  has become more democratic. However, with many ANC members in  management positions, the SABC will have to guard against  slipping back into its former role as the exclusive voice of the  regime." "Before any decision is taken on the SABC's funding,  the broadcaster's role needs to be defined, as does management's  financial accountability." "What is needed is a full appraisal  of what services the SABC should most appropriately provide, who  should be accountable and how they should be transmitted. Only  then can the queation be addressed of how the public broadcaster  is to be financed."</p>

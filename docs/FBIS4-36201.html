			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Santanu Saikia] </F>   [Text] Finance Minister Manmohan Singh has estimated that  disinvestment of shares of public sector undertakings (PSUs) in  1994-95 can mop up as much as Rs [rupees] 8000 crore, twice the  amount earmarked for mobilisation in the budget estimates.    Beyond the Rs 4000 crore mark, receipts from disinvestment  will be used to reduce escalating Government debt, Singh said in  a note to the Cabinet last week.    Though scalded by a Public Accounts Committee (PAC)  indictment on the manner in which shares were disinvested in  1990-91, Singh has decided to push ahead with a bold  disinvestment programme this year too. He has identified 28  PSUs whose shares would be off-loaded.    Besides the traditional auction mechanism, two new routes  have been identified for disinvesting PSU shares. One is to  ride piggyback on PSUs when they tap the stock market to expand  their equity base. Disinvestments would be clubbed with a  premium equity or rights issue of a PSU.    The other new method would be to directly tap the Global  Depository receipts (GDR) market for large-scale disinvestments  as foreign markets have the necessary depth to absorb large  issues of risk capital. Riding piggyback with a PSU flotation  in the GDR market is an additional mechanism that may be tapped.    In a marked departure from previous disinvestment  programmes,  Singh has proposed equal sharing of proceeds between PSUs and  Government. Half the funds mopped up through disinvestment will  go PSUs, to take care of their own internal requirements.    The note said auctions will be held several times during the  year. The public issue route will be open throughout the year,  though the preferred time of entry will be when there is  sufficient buoyancy in the market.    Of the 237 PSUs in the country, only 37 qualify for  disinvestment based on the yardstick of consistent profitability  over the last three years, and large free reserves equal to or  higher than the paid-up capital (which can give rise to a bonus  issue subsequently). Some PSUs have not been taken up for  disinvestment despite being profitable, as the free reserves are  not large enough vis-a-vis the paid-up capital.    After completion of all formalities, including capital  restructuring and capitalisation, the following companies have  been identified for disinvestment: Bharat Petroleum, Cochin  Refineries, IBP [expansion unknown], Lubrizo, ONGC [Oil and  Natural Gas Commission], OIL [expansion unknown], Indian Oil,  HOC [expansion unknown], IPCL [Indian Petrochemicals Corporation  Limited], VSNL [expansion unknown], MTNL [Mahanagar Telephone  Nigam Limited], BHEL [Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited], Nyveli  Lignite Corp, Andrew Yule, ITI [expansion unknown], Hind  Teleprinters, BEL [Bharat Electronics Limited], BEML [expansion  unknown], Shipping Corp, Air India, Dredging Corp, IRCON [Indian  Railway Construction Company], NALCO [expansion unknown], HMT  [Hindustan Machine Tools], SAIL [Steel Authority of India],  State Trading Corporation, Mineral and Metals Trading  Corporation and MSTC [expansion unknown].    PSUs like Steel Authority of India (SAIL), HMT and State  Trading Corporation will have to wait in the wings until  adequate capital restructuring takes place. And units like  Hindustan Zinc, Hindustan Copper, Rashtriya Chemicals &amp;  Fertilisers and Fertilizers &amp; Chemicals Travancore Limited,  which lack a friendly investors' perspective, will not be  offloaded until the outlook improves.    Sensitive PSUs -- from the national view point -- Hindustan  Auronatics, Central Warehouse Corporation, Cotton Corporation of  India etc -- will not qualify for disinvestment.    In the negative list will also be shares where disinvestment  has brought Government holdings down to the critical level of 51  per cent. They are Hindustan Petroleum Ltd and Madras  Refineries.    Shares of Indian Oil, Oil India, ONGC, Air India, Lubrizol,  IBP and Hindustan Teleprinters will be sold only after adequate  capitalisation of free reserves takes place, by way of bonus  shares issued to the Government.    If shares are sold by public auction, the minimum bid will  continue to be at Rs 25,000 or the value of 100 shares,  whichever higher. The reserve price of shares will-be fixed in  consultation with the International Development Bank of India  and Industrial Finance Corporation of India. Ten per cent of  the bid value will have to be deposited with authorities before  bidding starts.</p>

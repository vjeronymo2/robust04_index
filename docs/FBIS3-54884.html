			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [ITAR-TASS report under the "Details" rubric: "Has the </F> LDPR's Money Been Found?"]    [Text] ALGEMEEN DAGBLAD writes that the Dutch economic  monitoring service and the Central Bank of Russia have decided  to begin an investigation into an article in SEGODNYA according  to which the GMM trust company, registered in the Netherlands,  lent financial support to V. Zhirinovskiy during his election  campaign in Russia. The political aspects are not the issue  here, according to the newspaper, but possible violations of the  law on granting credits.    Japan's SANKEI SHIMBUN, touching on press reports that the  Dutch company GMM granted Zhirinovskiy's party $800,000 to fund  its election expenses, remarks in its commentary: "So far there  is no precise information suggesting the Dutch company's role in  financing the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia], but as  of today it has been definitely confirmed that branches of the  Zhirinovskiy party election campaign had premises in GMM  advertising branches in Russia, and that the Dutch company's  advertising and Zhirinovskiy's election campaign were funded  from the same source.    "Light may be thrown on the Dutch firm's role in funding the  LDPR in the near future, since the Netherlands Ministry of  Finance has begun an investigation into GMM's activity, using as  a pretext this firm's breach of national laws on security  transactions."</p>

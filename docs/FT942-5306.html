			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Serb commanders remain confident of Bosnia victory Firmly convinced that peace talks on Bosnia will remain deadlocked, Serb commanders maintain that the final settlement will be reached on the battlefield. From his hill-top command post in northern Bosnia, Lt-Colonel Miko Skoric insists that Serb forces will honour an agreement reached by their leaders. 'But the war will end only when the Moslems are defeated.' He echoes the oft-repeated threats of his military chiefs - that Serb forces will seize all of Bosnia if the Moslems sustain their offensive. There is scant evidence of this offensive, much heralded by the Serbian media. Instead of a major military push, the occasional crash of artillery rounds inflicting civilian casualties in Serb-held towns, appears to signal the growing confidence of the Bosnian army. Eager to portray the Serbs as victims, guides point to a gaping hole where a tank round ripped through the wall of the medical centre at Doboj, northern Bosnia. In a departure from the usual military bravado, Lt-Col Milovan Milutinovic, the Serb army spokesman, even claims huge losses in a recent battle in the area. Despite these reports, Serb soldiers on the northern front appear relaxed and self-assured. In fact, say diplomats, there are signs that Serb forces are preparing to launch an attack in northern Bosnia, a region which both sides see as crucial to the war's outcome. The Serb corridor, linking Belgrade to Serb-held land in Bosnia and Croatia, weaves through the northern Posavina, the Sava River valley. Lt-Col Skoric say the Serbs will never give up this land. As though following an order, local commanders no longer use the term 'corridor'. They say that the Posavina historically was Serbian, ignoring the fact that, before the war, Moslems and Croats comprised the bulk of the population. Republika Srpska, the self-styled Serb state which covers more than 70 per cent of Bosnia, depends on the corridor for survival. People show little remorse for their former neighbours in the towns of Doboj and Brcko, who were mostly Moslem before the outbreak of war in April 1992. Instead, they complain that the West has sided with their Moslem enemies. With each day of what they call Moslem delays in reaching a political settlement, Serb commanders say the Bosnian army risks losing everything. 'When Serb forces re-take territory, we don't just take a few metres but several kilometres,' says Lt-Col Skoric, laughing. 'Like the Moslems, we see Bosnia-Hercegovina as our fatherland. We also believe that much more land should belong to us.'</p>

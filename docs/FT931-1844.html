			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / BR doubts mandate for stoppage: Rail union calls one-day strike BRITISH RAIL said last night that the RMT transport union, the main rail union, lacked a clear mandate from its members for a 24-hour strike on April 2 against threatened redundancies. The union announced earlier in the day that its members had voted 26,097 to 10,314 in a 64 per cent turnout in favour of a 24-hour strike and further industrial action. BR said that fewer than 40 per cent of RMT members had voted to support disruption. 'This result reflects the real reservations of railway staff towards calls for industrial action,' it said. 'RMT must acknowledge that it does not have a mandate for anything, and pull back from any action they may have contemplated.' Sir Bob Reid, BR's chairman, promised that BR would try to find 'a way through to avoid disruption'. He said: 'I am hopeful we will be able to avoid the industrial action. Talks may be held today with RMT leaders to try to resolve their differences.' Mr Jimmy Knapp, RMT's general secretary, said that the vote had been about jobs. He added: 'The message is clear - enough is enough.' The union fears that 20,000 jobs are at risk on the railways as a result of privatisation in addition to the 7,000 redundancies already planned for this year. RMT officials want BR to guarantee that there will be no compulsory redundancies in the railway industry and that contract labour will not be used as a replacement for existing workers. The planned strike action on the railways on April 2 coincides with a 24-hour stoppage by members of the National Union of Mineworkers. Mr Knapp would not rule out further one-day strikes if BR did not reassure the union about redundancies. The other rail unions, Aslef, the footplateman's union, and TSSA, the staff union, are not involved in the disruption. RMT members include signalmen, and the railway system cannot function if they refuse to work. If the planned 24-hour strike goes ahead it will be the first stoppage by the RMT since 1989.</p>

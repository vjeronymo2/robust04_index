The ESC writes: "The  Latin American countries are trying to attract direct European  investment. Over recent years the EU has been one of the  principal sources of direct investment in the region. In some  years it has outstripped all others. Direct investment can help  to generate employment, to promote technology transfer and to  modernize infrastructure, agriculture and industry. It can also  contribute to the economic stability of the recipient country.  However, the world recession and investment requirements in the  EU itself (arising from the internal market) and in other areas  (such as Central and East Europe) could lead to a diminishing  flow of direct European investment to Latin America. At the  same time the wave of privatizations, which attracted major  capital flows, has come to an end in a number of Latin American  countries. A number of other factors have also been  influential, such as the attempted coups d'etat in Venezuela,  the presidential crisis in Brazil and the referendum against  privatization in Uruguay. Against this backdrop, EU instruments  for promoting cooperation investment, such as the Business  Corporation Network and the EU-IIP have an important role to  play. More could perhaps be done - e.g. through the EU  representations in the various countries -to bring these  instruments to the notice of potential investors. Member state  financial incentives to encourage companies to invest in Latin  America are likewise of primary importance. Some Latin American  countries have achieved a sufficient level of economic  development, stability and economic growth to be eligible for  EIB [European Investment Bank] loans and financial support from  the member states for a whole range of projects (e.g. improved  energy supplies, trade promotion, industrial cooperation, joint  ventures and technology transfer).    ``This is helping to improve the business climate, build  mutual confidence and broaden Latin American market prospects  for European products. The Committee urges the Commission to  prepare studies on European investment opportunities in Latin  America and, in the light of its findings, to draw up proposals  for expanding the range of EU instruments for promoting such  investment. Similarly, it calls upon the member states to take  steps to back direct private and public investment in the  region. It is also important for Latin America that a favorable  business climate be maintained, that an adequate legal framework  be created, notably to combat the expropriation practices which  have been used in the past, and that sufficient economic and  political stability prevail to try to attract and keep foreign  investors in the region and encourage the repatriation of  capital which had fled the region in the past. Past mistakes --  which led to the debt crisis and cost the region the `wasted  decade' of the 1980's -- must be avoided in the use of public  and private funds. It must be remembered that debt is still at a  high level and could, in the medium-term, jeopardize the  relative stability achieved over the last few years."</p>

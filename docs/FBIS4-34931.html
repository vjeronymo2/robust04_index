			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by President Rafael Caldera on the occasion of Army </F> Day from Paseo Carabobo in Caracas -- live]    [Text] The country's present situation dictates that I add  a few words to the congratulatory message I sent today, on  occasion of the anniversary of the immortal battle of Carabobo,  to the Army commander, officers, junior officers, military  academy cadets, enlisted troops, and civilian personnel working  for the glorious Venezuelan Armed Forces, which today  commemorates its special day. Under these circumstances, I must  say that I am determined to halt all morbid and criminal  attempts to ruin our national currency, which bears the  magnificent name of Bolivar, as well as all attempts to deplete  our operational reserves. The national government is determined  to adopt all necessary measures and quite clearly states that  whatever situation the country may face, we have the resources  required to meet our international obligations and to satisfy  the country's most basic needs.    The current situation has circumstantial causes, among which  we can mention the distrust that has arisen as a result of  despicable rumors that have been intentionally disseminated and  the speculators who have no qualms about resorting to any  measure for personal gain. We are facing difficult times, but  the country understands this and knows that we will overcome it  with the support of all Venezuelans.    The fall of our currency has reactivated inflationary  pressure that we had practically controlled by limiting the  fiscal deficit. If it is true that inflationary pressure is  reflected over the price of goods, it is also true that  speculation has lead consumers to purchase more goods over and  above any inflationary pressure. The national government is  determined to utilize any means possible to alleviate the  situation of lower income groups my making basic goods  accessible and by improving the wages of all public and private  sector workers. In that respect, we call for everyone's  understanding and support.    I warn those who are determined to foment disturbances that  the people repudiate the violence they are promoting. A majority  of the population knows that violence solves nothing and only  leads to more violence. Those inciters of violence must keep in  mind that even if they can obtain the temporary support of some  small groups, they will never ensure the total support of a  majority of the population. The national government, with the  absolute and determined backing of the National Armed Forces, is  prepared to repress violence with all the moderation it can  muster, but also with the necessary energy. It is our duty to  solve the country's predicament under these circumstances, and  we are going to do it. Today, at this time and at this place,  which reminds us of the battle of Carabobo, I would like to  reaffirm my solemn duty to the Venezuelan people. The Republic  will not be lost in my hands.

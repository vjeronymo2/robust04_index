			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / Fimbra payouts increase tenfold INDEPENDENT financial advisers were forced to pay clients more than Pounds 1.2m as compensation for 'mis-selling' in 1992, a tenfold rise on the previous year, Norma Cohen writes. According to figures released yesterday by Fimbra, the self-regulatory body which oversees the industry, most of the claims amounting to Pounds 731,000 stemmed from purchases of so-called home income plans. These were contracts under which clients were encouraged to mortgage their homes and purchase an annuity. In 1991 investors won claims of Pounds 110,632 against Fimbra members of which Pounds 72,000 was related to home-income plans. The figures were published as part of Fimbra's first report of performance indicators, which it now intends to publish quarterly. The data also show a sharp rise in consumer complaints against Fimbra members and an equally sharp rise in Fimbra's supervisory visits and punitive actions against members. Complaints rose to 3,212 last year from 2,651 in 1991 while compliance visits last year rose to 3,294 from 2,564 in 1991. Fimbra suspended 254 members last year and collected more than Pounds 339,000 in fines and costs. The year before it suspended 127 members and collected more than Pounds 255,000 in fines and costs.</p>

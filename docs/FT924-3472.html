			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Lloyd's brokers prepare terrorism cover BROKERS at the Lloyd's of London insurance market are working with industrial risk managers on a plan to provide insurance protection against terrorist damage, which they hope to present to the government this week. Insurers announced last month that new commercial insurance policies would probably exclude cover for terrorism from January 1. But so far, the government has not responded to pleas to extend the Northern Ireland compensation scheme - which directly meets the cost of bomb and other terrorism damage - to the mainland, leaving industry potentially unprotected from the IRA's mainland bombing campaign. The new proposals have been developed by the Association of Insurance and Risk Managers in Industry and Commerce (Airmic), and the Lloyd's Insurance Brokers Committee (LIBC). Insurers would be asked to continue to offer insurance cover for terrorism, but offload their exposures into a reinsurance pool, funded from reinsurance premiums and possibly jointly managed by brokers, insurers and insurance buyers. The government would be asked to reinsure all claims over an upper annual limit - probably about Pounds 200m. Mr Alan Fleming of Airmic said government and insurance industry participation was essential. 'What is so worrying is that it is taking so long to get a scheme in place,' Mr Fleming said. Airmic and the LIBC say they have the backing of Mr John Greenway, MP for Rydale, and chairman of the all-party committee for insurance and financial services. They also hope to persuade Lloyd's to back the plan. Meanwhile, American International Group, the New York-based insurance group, has asked a team of anti-terrorist and bomb disposal experts to carry out risk assessments of buildings belonging to clients in the City before extending cover under its sabotage and terrorism policy. Mr Ian Harrison, AIG's senior underwriter for special risks in the UK, said yesterday his company planned to make such surveys a precondition before extending cover on a 'stand-alone' or specific-risk basis to prominent locations that may be potential terrorist targets in the UK. As an individual risk, terrorism insurance will be subject to its own terms and conditions rather than being automatically included in standard property insurance. 'The bottom line is that the terrorist threat has to be taken seriously and (if) we can minimise our risk by insisting on such surveys, then we should do it,' Mr Harrison said. According to other anti-terrorist experts, the present wave of bombings is presenting a serious tactical challenge to the security services, who have had to adapt their operations accordingly. It is thought that there may be at least three IRA active units at large on the British mainland. Some 600 Names at Lloyd's of London met yesterday to discuss taking legal action. They are members of Merrett syndicate 418, angry about losses of at least Pounds 132.4m from the 1985 underwriting year. Names are being asked to raise up to Pounds 4.4m to finance the possible action.</p>

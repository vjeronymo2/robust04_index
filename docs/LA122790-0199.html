			<p><P> December 27, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TOP 10 ALBUMS  </P> <P> Overall Top 10 albums, as selected by Times Orange County Edition pop music  writers:  </P> <P> </P> <P> MIKE BOEHM  </P> <P> 1. Neil Young &amp; Crazy Horse, "Ragged Glory" (Reprise).  </P> <P> 2. John Hiatt, "Stolen Moments" (A&amp;M).  </P> <P> 3. Chris Gaffney, "Chris Gaffney &amp; the Cold Hard Facts" (ROM).  </P> <P> 4. Charles Brown, "All My Life" (Bullseye Blues/Rounder).  </P> <P> 5. Van Morrison, "Enlightenment" (Mercury).  </P> <P> 6. Sinead O'Connor, "I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got" (Ensign/Chrysalis).  </P> <P> 7. Rosanne Cash, "Interiors" (Columbia).  </P> <P> 8. Raindogs, "Lost Souls" (Atco).  </P> <P> 9. Eggplant, "Sad Astrology" (Dr. Dream).  </P> <P> 10. Tom Verlaine, "The Wonder" (Fontana import).  </P> <P> </P> <P> RANDY LEWIS:  </P> <P> 1. Neil Young &amp; Crazy Horse, "Ragged Glory," (Reprise)  </P> <P> 2. Los Lobos, "The Neighborhood" (Slash)  </P> <P> 3. The O'Kanes, "Imagine That," (Columbia)  </P> <P> 4. Sinead O'Connor, "I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got," (Chrysalis)  </P> <P> 5. Chris Gaffney, "Chris Gaffney &amp; the Cold Hard Facts," (ROM)  </P> <P> 7. Bob Dylan, "Under the Red Sky," (Columbia)  </P> <P> 6. John Hiatt, "Stolen Moments," (A&amp;M)  </P> <P> 8. Johnny Clegg &amp; Savuka, "Cruel, Crazy Beautiful World," (Capitol)  </P> <P> 9. Rosanne Cash, "Interiors" (Columbia)  </P> <P> 10. James Harman Band, "Strictly Live . . . in '85."(Rivera)  </P> <P> </P> <P> JIM WASHBURN  </P> <P> 1. Los Lobos, "The Neighborhood" (Slash). The seemingly simple songs here may  not make much of an initial splash, but they are like depth charges, resonating  with life's sorrows and joys when they do sink in, with some great barbecue  stomps thrown in to boot. A plain masterpiece.  </P> <P> 2. The Neville Brothers, "Brother's Keeper" (A&amp;M). Forget the car  commercials, the Nevilles are the heartbeat of America, and perhaps its  conscience as well, with songs here that look head on at the '90s and at the  honesty and love it's going to take to survive them.  </P> <P> 3. Robert Johnson, "The Complete Recordings" (Columbia). Recorded in a '30s  hotel room on primitive equipment, bluesman Johnson's legacy carries on into  the CD age as some of the most naked, human and scarifying music extant. One of  the treasures of American culture done justice in this 2-CD box set.  </P> <P> 4. Chris Gaffney, "Chris Gaffney and the Cold Hard Facts" (ROM). Costa Mesan  Gaffney may not have a hellhound on his trail, but there's at least an evil  Chihuahua dogging his heels. The singer-accordionist is a killer songwriter,  and he brings a powerful sense of mood to both riotous tales of cantina mishaps  and heartaching ballads of sundered love and fear-locked neighborhoods.  </P> <P> 5. The James Harman Band, "Strictly Live . . . in '85" (Rivera). Other than the  studio-sounding vocals and harmonica calling this album's title into question,  "Strictly Live . . . in '85" gives a fair glimpse of what made the old Harman  lineup -- with guitar wonders Kid Ramos and the late Hollywood Fats -- one of  the most exciting bands on the planet.  </P> <P> 6. Desert Rose Band, "Pages of Life" (Curb/MCA). There's scarcely a hair out of  place in this highly polished set from Chris Hillman and Co., but the passion  still comes through in questing songs, rich vocal harmonies and shimmering  guitar interplay.  </P> <P> 7. Jonathan Richman, "Jonathan Goes Country" (Rounder). The wedding of the  ever-elfin Mr. Richman and a country studio band isn't entirely made in heaven,  but some of his best songs are here, including a comical romp through Reno and  a beautiful cover of Marty Robbins' "Man Walks Among Us."  </P> <P> 8. The Geto Boys, "The Geto Boys" (Def Jam). Sure, these guys are as  reprehensible, violent and sexist as anything you'll find on TV, but they're  also furious and funny, and they pump the most demanding rhythms to come out of  Houston since Archie Bell and the Drells. The last rap group you'll ever need.  </P> <P> 9. Texas Tornados, "Texas Tornados" (Warner Bros). These guys are the real  Wilburys. Lone Star perennials Doug Sahm, Flaco Jimenez, Freddie Fender and  Augie Meyers join up to churn out a true, dirt-under-the-fingernails,  dance-hall celebration.  </P> <P> 10. Youssou N'Dour, "Set" (Virgin). Senegalese singer-bandleader N'Dour  achieves an irresistible blend of African and Western musical influences here,  with his plaintive vocals soaring above it all.  </P></p>

			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / International Company News: Bergesen posts deficit of NKr32m BERGESEN, Norway's biggest shipping group, plunged into an eight-month pre-tax loss of NKr32m (Dollars 5.44m) from a NKr816m profit in the same period last year, and warned of weakness for the remainder of the year. The result was worse than analysts' forecasts. Bergesen was forced to take a NKr141m loss on its share portfolio due to investments in Den norske Bank, Norway's biggest bank, and Uni Storebrand, the country's biggest insurer which collapsed into the hands of state administrators in August. The group wrote down the value of DnB's shares to NKr2.50 each but the shares have been trading on the Oslo bourse at under NKr1.50. At the start of the year the book value of Bergesen's share portfolio was NKr952m but increased to NKr1.05bn by end-August due to investments. However, the market value of the portfolio fell by NKr410m to NKr1.08bn by end-August. Operating profit for shipping plunged to NKr60m from NKr663m while group operating profit fell to NKr61m from NKr679m. Group operating revenue dropped NKr516m to NKr1.62bn as expenses in the eight-month period rose NKr45m to NKr1.22bn.</p>

			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / Economics and all that jazz: America The US may have an ailing economy, but its economics profession is the envy of the world. At the new year, the cafes of the French quarter of New Orleans buzzed with the speculation of 7,000 social scientists, in town for the annual meeting of the American Economics Association. Where is the profession going? With more than 500 sessions - many concurrent  -and 1,500 individual presentations, personal views must be subjective. But I left with two positive impressions: first, that leading academic economists are becoming more worldly and less obsessed by abstruse mathematics; second, that the profession is growing less patient with the comforting simplicities of free-market economics. A decade ago, economic 'stars' such as Mr Robert Lucas of Chicago University preached an abstract souped-up version of monetarism known as 'rational expectations'. Building on the work of Milton Friedman and others, they argued that government intervention was ineffectual even in the very short run. Although such theories created the climate for egregious policy errors  -such as the neglect of the dollar in the early 1980s - the theorists rarely strayed from their ivory towers. Today much has changed. The leading young theorists are heavily involved in policy. Mr Jeffrey Sachs, the Harvard economist, spoke with authority on privatisation at the conference, largely because of his practical experience as an adviser to the Russian and Polish governments. Another Harvard star, Mr Lawrence Summers, has left academia temporarily to serve as chief economist at the World Bank. In New Orleans, he seemed to pop up everywhere, cutting through theoretical arguments with simple, colourful examples drawn from real life. Mr Paul Krugman of MIT - honoured at the conference with the Clark Medal for outstanding achievement under the age of 40 - is in the same mould. While best known for his pioneering work on trade theory, he has played a prominent role in US policy debates, strenuously advocating the merits of flexible exchange rates. Having switched to economics from history, he claims to use George Orwell as a stylistic model and to have little patience for the 'dense mathematics' that peppers too many academic papers. Mr Summers has no more respect for technical wizardry. Today, he notes approvingly, the leaders of the profession are 'mathematically less able but more worldly' than their counterparts a decade ago. The second judgment - that the pendulum is swinging away from free market economics - partly reflects the pattern of recent theoretical advances. In spheres such as trade theory, labour economics, and finance, new models tend to be 'neo-Keynesian', meaning they emphasise the importance of market imperfections. Using a cricketing analogy, one economist noted that free market theorists who were hitting boundaries in the 1970s and early 1980s now found themselves 'padding up' to face fast balls from the likes of Mr Krugman. The stagnation of the US economy over the past three years, which has led to cuts in academia as well as government and industry, has undoubtedly helped fuel hostility to Reaganite nostrums. Rather than emphasising the flaws of government, many academics are now looking at what the public sector can do to strengthen the economy's supply side - for example, by reforming education or renewing crumbling physical infrastructure. In New Orleans, openly left-wing economists (a tiny minority in the US) received a sympathetic hearing. Mr David Gordon of the New School for Social Research in New York, for example, argued that US industry was hobbled by adversarial relations between workers and employers. Companies failed to invest, and employees resisted new work practices because neither side trusted the other. Nobody quibbled when he claimed that greater co-operation would be the key to enhanced productivity in the longer term. But shifts in the ideological climate should not be exaggerated. A new macroeconomics textbook by Mr Gregory Mankiw, another rising Harvard star, is strikingly different from the texts I remember from the 1970s. The conventional Keynesian economics that formed the core of courses in the immediate post-war decades is relegated to the second half of the book, and balanced by long sections emphasising the classical principles that predated Keynes. 'Everybody is to the right of where we were in the 1960s,' says Mr Summers, 'but less to the right than five or six years ago.' Finally, the conference illustrated the extraordinary diversity of modern economics. There is no subject, it seems, on which economists are not prepared to pronounce. The smorgasbord of seminars included sessions on 'the economics of religion' and 'the economics of sexual orientation'. The presidential address, by Mr Thomas Schelling of the University of Maryland, was entirely devoted to the threat of global warming and contained barely any economics. The willingness of some cutting-edge theoreticians to immerse themselves in practical policy issues bodes well. So does the shift away from rigid free market theory. Yet with these trends as yet poorly established, it is perhaps not surprising that the profession's luxuriant growth in the US has coincided with America's relative economic decline. The rise of Japan, which has no world-class economists, testifies to the irrelevance of much conventional economic theory.</p>

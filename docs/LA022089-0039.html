			<p><P> February 20, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> SATELLITES AS SEXTANTS;  </P> <P> A NEW $8-BILLION ORBITING NAVIGATIONAL SYSTEM WILL PROVIDE MILITARY AND  MARINERS ALIKE WITH ACCURATE POSITIONING ALL OVER THE GLOBE  </P> <P> There was a quarter moon that night, but a thick fog blotted it from view.  </P> <P> At 5:30 a.m. a computer science technician named Valerie Wong stood in a  parking lot in Monrovia and pointed a gray battery-powered plastic box at the  heavens and homed in on some military satellites.  </P> <P> She was trying to find out, literally, where she stood.  </P> <P> The screen flashed 34 degrees, 8.38 minutes north; 117 degrees, 59.77 minutes  west. "This is going to be accurate within 30 meters," Wong said.  </P> <P> Punching some buttons on a computerized receiver to find your position doesn't  quite have the romance of Capt. James Cook squinting through a sextant in the  18th Century to guide his ship to the Pacific, or of Charles Lindbergh nosing  the Spirit of St. Louis down to within 10 feet of the Atlantic so he could look  at the waves to gauge the wind and help keep him on course to Paris.  </P> <P> But the Air Force's new collection of navigation satellites, called Global  Positioning System, will help people find their way around the globe with more  precision than ever before. The $8-billion project will provide the military  with navigation sitings accurate to about 50 feet anywhere in the world, day or  night, in the worst of weather.  </P> <P> This degree of accuracy is available only at the high-level military frequency  used by GPS, which eventually will require encryption devices to decode.  Another channel, with an accuracy of roughly 300 feet, is planned for broadcast  in the open for anyone -- foreign, domestic, military or civilian -- to use.  </P> <P> Surveyors, oil firms, aerospace companies and the military have tested and  generally liked GPS, and in the next few years GPS receivers will be installed  in planes, boats and even cars.  </P> <P> At the moment only eight test GPS satellites are in orbit, so there are gaps in  coverage around the globe, including certain areas of the South Pacific and  some of the polar regions.  </P> <P> At this time of year the satellite coverage is available in Los Angeles about  five hours a day, which is why Wong was out so early. She works for Magellan  Systems, a small company that plans to begin selling in March $3,000 portable  2-pound GPS receiver that, on the power of six penlight batteries, will help  sailors find their way around the world. Until the Air Force starts beaming out  two signals, civilian users will have access to the military-quality signal.  </P> <P> The Air Force took the first step to boost GPS to full-time coverage last week  with the launch of the first of the next batch of satellites from Cape  Canaveral. Several satellites will be fired up each year until the full  constellation of 21 to 24 satellites is completed in 1992, which in six orbital  planes will blanket the Earth from about 11,000 miles up.  </P> <P> Granted, there are plenty of other navigation tools, including various modern  radio beacons. But these have their weaknesses.  </P> <P> "People have found a way to cope with other navigation systems," said Thomas  Stansell, director of advanced programs for Magnavox, which, along with  Rockwell International and several other companies, makes GPS receivers for the  military. "What they are going to find out about GPS is it does it better than  anything else they've ever seen."  </P> <P> The Soviets seem to agree. They are launching their own copycat design called  Global Navigation Satellite System, a 24-satellite system for their military,  with plans to offer Glonass for civilian use worldwide as well.  </P> <P> Two researchers from the University of Leeds in England have been tracking  Glonass and their early reviews aren't glowing. Depending on who is counting,  the Russians have launched from 27 to 39 Glonass satellites, yet only a handful  are working properly.  </P> <P> The Air Force's GPS satellites work by a combination of atomic clocks and radio  beacons, but the basic navigation principle is as old as the sextant. It uses  time and several points of reference in the sky to plot a fixed position.  </P> <P> Each of the satellites has four atomic clocks that are accurate to within  50-billionths of a second.  </P> <P> A GPS receiver must locate signals from four satellites to calculate its three  dimensional position: longitude, latitude and altitude. Because each satellite  constantly emits a signal that identifies its position as well as a time check,  a GPS receiver can measure how long it took to receive a signal and, by  multiplying it by the speed of light with the help of some computer-aided  trigonometry, can continuously come up with a precise fix.  </P> <P> The first GPS test satellites were launched in 1978, and the American military  is sold on them.  </P> <P> "Soon as you let the troops get their hands on it, they come back with nothing  but praise for the system. The equipment is its own best advertisement," said  Air Force Col. Marty T. Runkle, GPS program director.  </P> <P> The military has 23,000 GPS receivers on order. Some infantry soldiers haul  around GPS receivers that are a compact 10 by 12 by 4 inches, and the Army  wants half of its tanks equipped with GPS receivers.  </P> <P> Other sets will go into fighter planes (the most expensive receivers are for  this purpose and cost $45,000), ships, submarines and missiles. Magnavox's GPS  sets, Stansell said, have been used "on every mine-sweeping task force in the  Persian Gulf."  </P> <P> GPS is expected to be particularly helpful to pilots because several  established navigation systems have troubling imperfections.  </P> <P> The Federal Aviation Administration operates 970 high-frequency transmitting  stations that provide navigational fixes accurate to within 1 nautical mile.  The trouble is that the signals travel line of sight and, because of the  curvature of the Earth, a pilot must switch from one station to another every  100 miles or so. Even worse, the signals are blocked by mountains and are  worthless in rugged areas.  </P> <P> Another common land-based radio signal is Loran, which helps ships and planes  find their way within 75 miles of the American and Canadian coastline. But bad  weather, notably thunderstorms, scrambles the Loran signal.  </P> <P> On long flights over water, commercial and military jets rely on inertial  navigation, which is essentially a combination of a fancy gyroscope that  creates a reference point by spinning in the direction of the North Pole and a  sophisticated speedometer that charts the distance traveled.  </P> <P> The gyroscope's bearings create friction that causes it to drift slightly,  however, so the longer a flight, the greater the error. Pilots expect an  inertial system to be wrong by 1 nautical mile per hour of flight.  </P> <P> It's also essential that the pilot punch in his correct position before taking  off; it he makes a mistake, the inertial system keeps compounding the blunder,  which may explain why in 1983 a Korean Air Line jet was 300 miles off course  over Soviet airspace when Russian fighters shot it down.  </P> <P> Boeing navigation engineer John Neilsen expects GPS to be commonplace in  airliners within 10 years, and he favors GPS as a tool for civilian planes.  </P> <P> The FAA is excited about GPS for both safety and cost reasons. Most airline  pilots want to fly with the jet stream to arrive faster and save fuel, but on  flights above 29,000 feet, planes must be separated laterally by at least 2,000  feet, so some must fly a less direct route.  </P> <P> "All aircraft want to fly in the same place, and you can't do that now," said  Clyde Miller, manager of the FAA's advanced concepts division.  </P> <P> With GPS's accuracy, he said, more planes "lanes" could be squeezed together,  as extra, but narrower, lanes might be added on a freeway. More efficient  flying on the busy North Atlantic route, Miller said, could save $450 million a  year in fuel.  </P> <P> For all the dazzle of GPS, there remain some bugs to work out. Private industry  hates the idea of the military cutting back the civilian accuracy to 100 yards.  Why a separate, less-accurate signal for civilians? "You wouldn't want to  provide the enemy the same advantage you are getting yourself," Runkle said.  </P> <P> The civilian aviation community is also leery about depending solely on GPS  because it fears that in a crisis, the military might cut off the civilian  signal. Another weakness in both GPS and Glonass is that if a satellite is  faulty and sends out bad signals, there is no immediate warning to civilians.  The FAA is pressing for a 10-second GPS warning system, and it may set up  ground stations to monitor the satellites for faulty signals.  </P> <P> Those problems aside, Chrysler thinks there is a dollar to be made on GPS and  has hooked up a GPS test system in a mini-van that plots positions on a  television screen with street maps shown in quarter square mile detail. Robert  Jensen, production engineering manager for Chrysler's Acustar division, says  that if GPS is on schedule, Chrysler can sell a GPS navigation system as an  option its 1993 luxury cars for about $1,500.  </P> <P> As prices drop, Jensen says, GPS could become standard equipment in rental  cars. "If you do a lot of traveling and arrive in a city for the first time and  don't know where to begin, GPS is ideal," he said. "It's like having somebody  next to you who knows where to go."  </P></p>

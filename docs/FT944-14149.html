			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / S Korea leader apologises over bridge collapse: Promise to punish 'those responsible' South Korea's President Kim Young-sam yesterday apologised to the public for last week's collapse of a Seoul motorway bridge that killed 32 people. Mr Kim, in a nationally televised speech, promised to punish those responsible for the accident and vowed 'to root out the corruption' prevalent in the construction industry. The bridge accident is perceived by South Koreans as an example of lax government administration, with Seoul authorities accused of ignoring warnings about the poor condition of the 15-year-old bridge. The accident also focuses renewed public attention on widespread graft that has contributed to sub-standard construction work in Korea. Officials claim many contractors divert funds from public infrastructure projects and use the money to bribe bureaucrats in charge of awarding lucrative government contracts. Many construction companies are also accused of saving on costs by using inferior materials and rushing building schedules, while government supervisors are said to be bribed to grant approval that the structures meet design specifications. The issue has taken on increased importance recently as Korea plans to spend Dollars 100bn (Pounds 66.6bn) on infrastructure projects during the next eight years. The government is considering increasing the period that contractors would be responsible for any building faults from five years at present, to 10 or 20 years after completion. Mr Kim also criticised Korean work practices in his speech. 'We cannot deny that during 30-odd years of economic growth, we have tended to implement projects too quickly, with more emphasis on quantity and superficial appearances than on quality and substance.' Five Seoul city officials have already been arrested for allegedly failing to conduct adequate inspections and maintenance of the collapsed Songsu Bridge that spans the Han River in the centre of the city. *something in here (HP) * Officials of the construction company which built the bridge are also expected to be questioned by prosecutors. The company blames the collapse on traffic loads that exceeded the bridge's design specifications. Civil engineers are now conducting inspections of the 16 other bridges across the Han River in Seoul. Mr Colin Snowdon, city engineer for the City of London, arrived in Seoul yesterday to help assess the structural condition of the bridges, following an offer of assistance by Sir Paul Newall, the Lord Mayor, who visited Korea in April.</p>

			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / Minding Your Own Business: Selling old technology to the Germans - A bike maker which avoids the fashion cycle THE LAST time Tim Pashley pitched up at a sales exhibition to show off the cycles his family company manufactures, someone chipped in with a question. 'Are these old bikes that you do up?' W R Pashley makes spanking brand new cycles, but you can see what the questioner was getting at. From the gates of the company's tiny factory in Stratford-upon-Avon roll 'butcher's boy' delivery bikes right out of a Norman Wisdom film: black-painted, sit-up-and-beg two wheelers stern enough for PC Plod, and ice-cream tricycles last seen on the prom at Blackpool. Pashley is the biggest supplier of bicycles to the Post Office. Sportier machines, tandems, and childrens' tricycles carry the Pashley name, but they are still all hand-made in chunky designs, constructed from steel, and painted in conservative colours. Some have brakes in the hub and chain guards. There is not a Day-glow turquoise sunburst paint job, light alloy frame, or 21-speed rig in sight. 'Our policy is to supply a series of niche markets,' says Pashley, the company's 36-year-old managing director. 'You won't find us making a BMX, mountain bike, ordinary children's cycle or sports bike. If a company like ours does that, you are up against large manufacturers who will kill you with the economics of scale.' So it has been since Tim's grandfather, William Rathbone Pashley, began his carrier cycle company in Birmingham in the 1920s. Pashley has remained a small supplier. Its yearly output of 10,000 bikes ranks it fifth behind Derby (formerly Raleigh), Townsend, Dawes and Hawk. It is successful, but not wildly profitable. From its yearly turnover of Pounds 1.7m, Pashley screws out a pre-tax profit of about Pounds 40,000. 'Margins are very tight in bike manufacturing.' That is one reason why, after 60 years, the company is now trying to learn some new tricks. It has just introduced a couple of more modern-looking machines, one of them with 12 speeds. It has appointed its first marketing manager, who will soon be joined by the company's first salesman. It is taking an outside cash injection of about Pounds 500,000, looking to raise sales to Pounds 2.5m this year. 'That won't disturb large bike makers, but it will help us raise profits to perhaps Pounds 250,000,' Pashley says. With Pashley two-wheelers costing between Pounds 250 and Pounds 330, geared to the private rider, the company appeals to people who like classic 'heavy bike' designs. (Its brochure shows off as many Barbours as bikes.) With model names like Prospero and Pickle, the image is hardly jazzy. To fund its stocks, the company uses a bank overdraft facility of Pounds 450,000, but the new equity comes from a venture capital company. 'We will develop our company without recourse to the banks, which have become increasingly unco-operative,' Pashley argues. 'The City is still a market which sees its profits in commercial trading, and the commodity happens to be cash.' You know what Pashley is thinking, but he does not articulate it: too much wonky bank lending in London to crooks - and as a result the provinces get it in the neck. The new cash injection, involving some dilution of the Pashley family shareholding, also covers another Pashley company, called Spencers, which makes bike and pram components. Tim Pashley says increasing volume will make the bike factory more cost-effective. The company has a workforce of 55 and a Pounds 530,000 yearly wage bill. To a large extent, Pashley has stood aloof from the UK bike boom (sales up from 600,000 bikes 20 years ago to 1.25m 10 years ago, and 2.5m in 1989, though this has back-pedalled to 2m last year). Almost half of the company's sales are to the Post Office. A third of its turnover comes from exports, mainly to countries such as Nigeria, where Pashley sturdiness suits road surfaces even more primitive than those in London. But it also sells delivery bikes to Germany, France and elsewhere on the continent, where one of its competitors is the crazily-named Smith &amp; Co of Denmark. At the moment Pashley is trying to win an order to supply 5,000 two-wheelers to the German Bundespost. In keeping with tradition, the Stratford factory is not exactly 21st century. The company buys in steel tubing already shaped and cut to length for the frames. Most of the frames are then put together by brazing. The tube joints, known as lugs, have molten brass poured into them - the brass acting as glue to hold two pieces of the frame together. This is carried out by blowtorch at an open hearth. The frame then disappears into a shotblasting cabinet in which iron filings are hurled at it, clearing off the joints and giving the frame a smooth grey finish. The joints are hand-smoothed further in a process known as fettling, and the frame is then painted, using hand-held electro-static powder coating equipment. Each bike is finally assembled by two people whose supply bins are packed with imported components. 'That includes tyres, wheel rims, chains, chain wheels and pedals, which all have to be imported because they are not available in the UK,' Pashley says. 'That is the sorry tale of the way British industry as a whole has gone.' Some bike saddles, and 3-speed gears, come from Britain; 12-speeders are bought from Japan. The company has usually found diversification painfully unsuccessful. It once produced motorised rickshaws, and a recent attempt to sell a an old-style bike with mountain bike-styled tubing failed. Tim Pashley remains confident, though, that its foray into more modern types of classic bikes will succeed. 'We are still appealing to the same audience - the 30-somethings, with money.'

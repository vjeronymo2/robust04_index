			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading The derivatives sector recorded one of its least active days this year as attention shifted to the possible outcome of today's Federal Open Markets Committee meeting in the US, writes Joel Kibazo. In futures, the September contract on the FT-SE 100 opened at 3,158. However, with many of the European markets enjoying an extended weekend, and no economic data on which to focus, trading was dull and carried out in very thin trading. A sharp mark-up said to have been led by independent traders (locals) saw September advance to 3,174, the peak of the session, before running out of steam on the back of a retreat in UK gilts. US industrial production data released in the second half of the session was in line with expectations and did little to encourage trading in September. After falling to a low of 3,144, the contract settled at 3,152, down 7 from its previous close and at a 10-point premium to cash. Volume was a paltry 5,786 lots. It was also a poor day in the traded options, a mere 21,265 contracts being traded, against Friday's 36,099. Among the index options, volume in the FT-SE 100 option fell back to 6,246 contracts, and the Euro FT-SE option saw business of 1,224 lots. Sears was the busiest stock option with a total of 2,000 trades dealt.</p>

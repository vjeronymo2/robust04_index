			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT;  </P> <P> NOTES ABOUT YOUR SURROUNDINGS.  </P> <P> They're Back -- In a typical season, only one or two American white pelicans  might be spotted in Orange County. But last fall, the birds made a sudden and  spectacular appearance, with as many as 200 seen wheeling above the Santa Ana  River Lakes in Anaheim.  </P> <P> Now, the American white pelican is back for the winter, although not quite in  the concentrations witnessed last season. Flocks of 20 and fewer have been seen  at spots around the county, including Irvine and Anaheim.  </P> <P> White pelicans have had problems farther north in the state this season.  Scientists recently investigated the deaths of more than 400 birds at Crowley  Lake in Mono County; starvation was the apparent primary cause of death in half  of all birds examined, but parasitic intestinal infestations contributed to  their mortality as well.  </P> <P> According to Doug Willick, who catalogs rare bird sightings in the county, no  similar problems have been reported locally. Numbers of white pelicans in the  county are much smaller than at Crowley and other locations.  </P> <P> Geese Gone -- The fall arrival of Canada geese at Quail Hill in Irvine, near  the Sand Canyon Road exit of the San Diego Freeway, has become an annual  tradition. Flocks estimated as large as 4,000 have been spotted there in recent  years, but this season numbers appear to be well below normal.  </P> <P> Usually, the geese begin arriving in late October and reach their peak about  now. Willick has visited the site several times in recent weeks without seeing  any of the geese, although they may have been at nearby Sand Canyon Reservoir.  Others have reported spotting small numbers of the geese at Quail Hill.  </P> <P> Willick speculates that with the warm weather, the geese may be staying farther  north and could still be pushed south with a big storm. Also, the dry fall has  meant little grass for foraging.  </P> <P> Quail Hill was recently set aside as a reserve for the geese as part of  Irvine's latest open-space agreement.  </P></p>

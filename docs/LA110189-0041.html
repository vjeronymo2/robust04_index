			<p><P> November 1, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FROM 'A-TEAM' TO A-BOMB;  </P> <P> MOVIES: DWIGHT SCHULTZ PORTRAYSJ. ROBERT OPPENHEIMER AS A BRILLIANT MAN TORN  OVER HIS ROLE IN BUILDING THE BOMB. CRITICS SAY THIS IS "AN IGNORANT  DISTORTION."  </P> <P> Was J. Robert Oppenheimer, builder of the world's first atomic bomb, the  tortured, morally divided soul depicted in Roland Joffe's new film "Fat Man and  Little Boy"? Or was he a man intently focused on succeeding, having made peace  with his role at the helm of the top-secret $2-billion Manhattan Project at Los  Alamos, N.M.?  </P> <P> In his film debut, actor Dwight Schultz portrays Oppenheimer as a brilliant but  weak man whose ambition overshadowed his inner doubts about the morality of  building an atomic bomb. Oppenheimer, says director Joffe, "is Hamlet as  Shakespeare would have written him if he was alive now." This Oppenheimer is  readily manipulated by the gruff military man in charge of the Manhattan  Project, Gen. Leslie R. Groves, played by Paul Newman.  </P> <P> But Schultz's portrayal has drawn criticism from other quarters. Richard  Rhodes, author of "The Making of the Atomic Bomb," which won the 1987 National  Book Award, calls this depiction "an ignorant distortion of the man. . . . The  Oppenheimer of wartime was not a divided human being. He was not Hamlet-like.  He was focused and centered on making this thing happen."  </P> <P> Critics too are divided on Schultz's performance. When the film opened last  month, The Times' Sheila Benson, for example, wrote that Schultz managed to  create "a believably complicated figure." But Newsweek's David Ansen wrote that  "neither Schultz nor the script gets inside the man's edgy, haunted soul."  </P> <P> Schultz became a contender for the part of Oppenheimer when Joffe -- determined  to cast an unknown -- asked his casting director to round up all the actors on  American stages who were currently portraying Valmont in "Les Liaisons  Dangereuses," a character notorious for manipulating and objectifying human  beings. He found Schultz in a production at the Williamstown (Mass.) Theater  Festival. Schultz may be not be a familiar face in Hollywood circles, but  millions of TV viewers know him as the zany "Howling Mad" Murdock on NBC's  former series "The A-Team." His stint on the "The A-Team" -- from 1983 to 1987,  when the series was canceled -- followed a long career on stage, but Schultz  had never appeared in a feature film.  </P> <P> Executives at Paramount were reticent about hiring someone without name  recognition with movie audiences. But Joffe persisted. "He has a volatile,  interesting mind," Joffe says of Schultz.  </P> <P> Schultz, ironically, also had an affinity for physics. In fact, he says, it was  Heinz Pagels' "The Cosmic Code" -- an attempt to explain quantum physics to the  layman -- that added important new perspective to his life.  </P> <P> The transformation came in 1982, at age 35, when Schultz was struggling,  sleeping on couches and barely scraping out a living as an actor. He was close  to giving up on show business. Pagels' book taught Schultz to look at the world  in more relative terms -- and not to take himself, or his profession, so  seriously.  </P> <P> "For example," Schultz says one afternoon as he picks up a copy of Pagels' book  from a coffee table, "in the micro world of particles, when scientists view  photons, if they want to view photons as a wave, it's a wave. If they want to  look at it as a particle, they behave as particles. . . . There was a lot of  philosophical discussion about this: Is it what I want it to be at the moment?"  </P> <P> Schultz applied these philosophical meanderings to his own life. "When someone  props you up and another tears you down, it's not a question of wrong or  right," he says. "And for you to try to beat yourself on the breast and say  you're a terrible person -- or say that you're a wonderful person because  everyone loves you -- is probably going a little too far."  </P> <P> His acting career up until then had been a struggle. He graduated from Towson  State University in Maryland and formed a touring company, the Baltimore  Theater Ensemble, with a couple of friends. Later he appeared in regional  productions before landing roles in Off-Broadway productions.  </P> <P> He made his Broadway debut in "The Water Engine," which began at Joseph Papp's  Public Theatre before being transferred to the Plymouth. He also starred on  Broadway in "Night and Day" with Maggie Smith and "The Crucifer of Blood." He  played opposite Charlton Heston when the production moved to L.A.'s Ahmanson  Theatre.  </P> <P> But in between stage work, Schultz struggled to make ends meet with odd jobs.  The financial hardship came to an end when Schultz swallowed his stage actor's  pride and auditioned for "The A-Team." Again, Pagels' book taught him the value  of not taking himself so seriously.  </P> <P> "It's the way you want to see it," Schultz says of TV shows like "The A-Team."  "If you want to see it as the epitome of art, it will be. If you want to see it  as the height of exploitation and degradation, it will be. Neither of them is  true. The truth is you're simply scratching out a living: I'm a song-and-dance  man. That's the truth and there's a relaxation that comes with that." After  reading Pagels' book, physics became a minor passion for Schultz.  </P> <P> Joffe looked at nearly 30 other actors before hiring Schultz to play  Oppenheimer. As Schultz recalls, he was cast the day before production began  and was forced to leave his daughter's 1-year birthday party to fly to Durango,  Mexico, where shooting was about to begin. There he continued discussions with  Joffe and Newman about how to portray Oppenheimer. "Being the typical actor,"  Schultz says, "I wanted to be very accurate (in the depiction of Oppenheimer).  When I told Roland this, he just rolled his eyes."  </P> <P> The reason for Joffe's reaction is that Oppenheimer spoke in a "clipped,  affected voice that at times was graceful but at other times had a tendency to  explode," Schultz says, doing his best Oppenheimer impersonation. "His voice  also had a Mr. Rogers quality to it." Joffe didn't want Schultz to impersonate  Oppenheimer's affected, often arrogant manner. "In a film about J. Robert  Oppenheimer, you could," says Schultz. "But in this film, we wanted to make him  more accessible, more of a human being faced with a dilemma rather than a man  who spent his life putting himself above other people."  </P> <P> Says Joffe: "I wanted our Oppenheimer to be as true as possible to the inner  Oppenheimer. We wanted to get at the inner truth, to feel the real tensions  inside these people (at Los Alamos). In public, Oppenheimer was a dominant,  powerful scientist. But he was also a vulnerable, weak man."  </P> <P> But Rhodes rejects the notion, forwarded in Joffe's film, that Groves played  the devil to Oppenheimer's Faust. After the war, Rhodes says, more moral doubts  did creep into Oppenheimer's thinking. For example, Rhodes notes, two years  after American military planes dropped the code-named "Fat Man" and "Little  Boy" bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Oppenheimer said to President Truman:  "Mr. Truman, I have blood on my hands." During and after the war, the  government viewed Oppenheimer as a security risk for his leftist views.  </P> <P> Schultz calls "Fat Man and Little Boy" "an impression of reality, not reality.  The attempt to make this human dilemma accessible was paramount, and anything  that detracted from it had to be chipped away."  </P></p>

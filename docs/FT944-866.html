			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / Management: Change for the better - A new role for the supervisor The role of the supervisor and the environment in which he or she operates have been 'transformed' for the better, according to new research published by Noel Patterson, director of Patterson James, a Surrey-based management consultancy. The role now holds a position in the management structure unrecognisable from that which it held a decade or more ago, claims Patterson, who draws his optimistic conclusion from research he has recently conducted in three industries: vehicle manufacture, paper manufacture and chemicals. However, he warns that a number of issues need to be addressed, including greater integration of supervisors in the management hierachy. Second, better promotional opportunities are needed in organisations where graduate-only entry is becoming the norm at higher levels. The demise of the supervisor began after the second world war, with the rise of trade unions and local shop stewards reducing the control, and hence the authority and status, of the supervisor. Patterson says: 'It was less than 10 years ago in managing oil distribution terminals in the Midlands that I witnessed first-hand the organisational and managerial view of supervision as a buffer between the 'decision-makers', that is the management, and the 'troops', a highly unionised workforce to be courted and placated. 'Management believed that good supervision 'kept things going' within the rulebook. However, when the rules came into conflict with the behaviour of those supervised, it was usual to abandon the supervisor who had held his line.' An erosion of trade union power, says Patterson, was among a number of changes that transformed the role of the supervisor. Others factors included the adoption of human resource management methods, which focused on the empowerment of the individual. Supervisors' views were canvassed in the preparation of Patterson's research at three companies. The results showed a gap between what managers perceived as the job performed by supervisors and the reality on the shopfloor. Managers, for example, saw the role as a motivational and co-ordinating one, but in practice it was production and quality targets which dominated supervisors' jobs. However, Patterson notes the emergence of a tier immediately below first-line supervisor level, which could free the supervisory role from the direct, more mundane tasks of supervision, leaving him or her free to take on a higher co-ordinating, managerial role. Supervisors, he said, were floating upwards in organisations where many middle managers had been removed by delayering. He warns, however, that as the economy picks up many employers could lose experienced supervisors who believe there is little opportunity for career progression. This is because a combination of the slimming down of organisations plus more graduate-only recruitment at higher levels has greatly reduced promotional opportunities for a group which at its core remains generally a white, male enclave. More attention, he warns, will need to be devoted to furthering supervisors' activities in communicating with the workforce and the promotion of a broader understanding of organisations' objectives. Indicative of this trend is the finding that 'motivational potential' is a selection criterion that is slowly emerging for supervisors, with both supervisors and management recognising that 'behavioural training'  - how to influence people's behaviour rather than their skills - is important. Patterson warns: 'In practice, it is technical job-related skills which tended to dominate and cross-functioning training is rare.' He adds that while the formal picture is optimistic much still needs to be done to truly consolidate the role of the modern supervisor. 'The agenda is there to be faced.'</p>

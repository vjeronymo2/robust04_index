The transitional government was officially seated  on Monday [7 March], but the inauguration of cabinet ministers  was delayed. The deployment of the African peacekeeping forces  to disarm the fighting factions has also run into difficulties.  A major split in ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for  Democracy in Liberia] is causing serious headaches, so is  renewed fighting in Rivercess regions, south of Buchanan,  between the Liberian Peace Council [LPC] and Charles Taylor's  NPFL [National Patriotic Front of Liberia] forces.    From Monrovia, (Niaty Allison) telexed this report:    ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire  Monitoring Group] is still being prevented from entering ULIMO  and NPFL territory, five days after the seating of the  transitional government. The chief of staff of the African  force, General Femi Williams, said our deployment there will  depend on how soon the problem in ULIMO is resolved and the  buffer zones are vacated. ULIMO fighters, loyal to renegade  General Roosevelt Johnson, are said to have cordoned off the  Bong Mine region and are in combat readiness against ULIMO  leader Alhaji Koromah's supporters, who are occupying areas west  of the (Simpe) River.    However, in the Todee area, about 35 miles northwest of the  capital, Monrovia, the peacekeeping force has deployed and is  being given cooperation even though actual disarmament has not  begun.    The African peacekeeping force and UN officials have been  carrying out shuttle diplomacy aimed at bringing the two  opposing sides in ULIMO together. The disarming of the soldiers  of the Armed Forces of Liberia, [AFL], continues today, with 300  soldiers handing in their guns.    On the political front, the Transitional Council announced  today that they would install cabinet ministers on Monday, 14  March. The list of appointees has not been released, and  according to an official at State House, the list is being held  up so as not to cause further confusion.    Meanwhile, thousands of people continue to stream into the  port city of Buchanan, fleeing the war between Charles Taylor's  NPFL and the George Bolley's Liberia Peace Council. LPC leader  George Bolley, a former minister in the government of Samuel  Doe, had, up until today, been the shadowy hand behind the LPC.  Now he has come out in public. He claimed that the LPC firmly  controls six counties, including Sinoe, Grand Gedeh, Rivercess,  Grand Kru, Maryland, and he said, nearly all of Grand Bassa  County, except Buchanan, which is controlled by the African  peacekeeping forces.    Fleeing women, children, and the elderly, yesterday told  stories of mass looting of warehouses by forces of the Liberia  Peace Council.</p>

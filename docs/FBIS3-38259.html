"My government's, and my own personal task are over," said  the former long-serving governor of the Bank of Italy, who was  brought in from that post to head the cabinet in April of last  year.    Answering questions at a joint press conference with  Austrian  Chancellor Franz Vranitzky, Ciampi said his government had been  set up to run the country until the approval and first  application of the new electoral system. "Strong or less strong  forms of renewal are to be found in all countries, and for  neighbouring countries the question is to follow them and learn  from them," commented Vranitzky. "I consider Ciampi as one of  the fundamental promoters of renewal in Italy, whence I wish  this renewal all possible success."</p>

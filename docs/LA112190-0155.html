			<p><P> November 21, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SOVIET REPUBLICS BERATED FOR KEEPING PRICE CONTROLS  </P> <P> The national government berated the Russian and Kazakhstan republics today for  refusing to obey a decree to lift price controls on jewelry, American  cigarettes and other luxury goods.  </P> <P> The State Prices Committee said the move to free market prices for  non-essential luxury items was inevitable, and that their prices should rise.  The Communist Party newspaper Pravda quoted the committee as saying the defiant  republics' refusal to obey the order was illegal.  </P> <P> Prices of many luxury items have been fixed by the state, but many are  regularly sold for much more than the official price by corrupt salesclerks and  even the factory workers who produce the goods and the truck drivers who  deliver them.  </P> <P> Women's shoes now cost $439 on average on the black market, a pack of 20  cigarettes costs $9 and a color television set $3,638 -- all three to six times  higher than state prices, a newspaper report said today.  </P> <P> The Council of Ministers, or Soviet Cabinet, announced last week that it was  lifting price controls on select items to encourage production of consumer  goods.  </P> <P> The order affected sales of furs, carpets, high-tech electronics, cut  glassware, china, car parts, caviar and imported whiskey and gin.  </P> <P> Within hours of the surprise announcement, the Russian republic refused to  enact it and temporarily forbade the sale of the affected goods on Russian  territory. The Central Asian republic of Kazakhstan also nullified the decree  within its borders, and Azerbaijan said today that it would ignore it while  studying its impact.  </P> <P> Floating prices are an important element of the government's plan to move to a  market economy from central planning, in which the government sets all prices  regardless of the cost of production.  </P> <P> The Supreme Soviet, or Parliament, adopted a plan for gradually freeing prices  last month but has run into resistance from some republics, notably Russia,  which has adopted its own plan.  </P> <P> The Rabochaya Tribuna (Workers Tribune) newspaper today quoted the Russian  Federation Statistics Committee as saying the black market prices of some  consumer goods in the republic exceeded state prices by 100% to 200% or more.  </P> <P> It said the average black market price for beef or pork was $16.20 and for a  small jar of caviar, $37.80, both four times the state price.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Feb. 14 (YONHAP) -- Army generals belonging  to "Hanahoe," a private club of some graduates of the Korea  Military Academy with close links to Former Presidents Chon  Tu-hwan and No Tae-u, and several top navy officers facing  age-limit discharges late this year have reportedly been asked  to leave voluntarily before the routine personnel changes in  April.    Personnel officers from Navy Headquarters met up to seven  officers with the rank of rear admiral and commodore, who face  age-limit discharge in December, and asked if they would step  down voluntarily in advance, navy sources said Thursday. The  concerned rear admirals responded to the request with anger,  labeling it "forced discharge," the sources said.    "The military personnel law sets the age limit of rear  admirals at six years and says the age-in-grade of general  officers can be extended for up to one year when their service  is required," said one officer allegedly asked to leave.    "We cannot accept such a proposal that not only dampens  military morale, but which is also against the status guarantee  of professional soldiers," another officer said.    They reacted strongly to the move by navy authorities,  saying  they could be mistaken for the targets of a purge in connection  with irregularities and thus would have difficulty finding  another job.    In the army as well, some 10 senior generals belonging to  Hanahoe, who were pushed into inactive posts or relieved of  their duties early last year, have reportedly been asked to  leave voluntarily because there are no available positions.  Most are said to have taken a dim view of the request for  "voluntary discharge" and demanded as a condition for their  voluntary discharge that discrimination against  field-grade-level members of Hanahoe be withdrawn.    Army and navy authorities said the request for early  discharge was part of efforts to reduce the number of generals,  whose ranks had expanded in the past administrations.    Some observers, however, point out that the move may do more  harm than good to a military that has recently shown signs of  recovering from earlier purges. The authorities said their  meeting with the generals was part of procedures before April's  appointments, adding they had just sounded out the generals on  voluntary discharge and had no intention of forcing them out.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Editorial Report] Tokyo Asahi Newstar Television Network  in Japanese at 1150 GMT on 11 June, in its "Sunday Project"  program, carries a 20-minute recorded interview with Kim  Myong-su, Study Department director under the Institute on  Korean Affairs, a think tank affiliated with the General  Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon), by  moderator Soichiro Tahara.    Asked whether the DPRK is working on developing nuclear  weapons, Kim says: "That is completely absurd. The DPRK is not  engaged in developing nuclear weapons." As to why the DPRK has  failed to grant thorough inspections of its nuclear facilities  by the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], Kim says North  Korea has actually let the IAEA conduct inspections, but notes  that there have been some misunderstandings between the DPRK and  the IAEA, pointing out that during negotiations between DPRK and  IAEA officials, IAEA officials have not listened to what the  DPRK had to say about how to conduct the inspections. Kim  criticizes the double standards the United States and the IAEA  adopts, noting that inspections are lenient toward pro-U.S.  countries that have already developed nuclear weapons such as  Israel and South Africa, while they are strict against anti-U.S.  countries.    At 1154 GMT, Tahara asks why the DPRK continues to refuse  thorough inspections if the country is not actually developing  nuclear weapons and thus, has nothing to hide. Kim argues that  the DPRK has refused inspections at the two undeclared  facilities at Yongbyong because they are military installations  which must be kept secret. He says the United States would not  allow nuclear inspections at its military facilities if it were  asked to do so. Tahara, however, retorts that the United States  does not have to allow inspections of nuclear weapons since they  are already recognized as nuclear weapons; he says the point of  issue here is that the DPRK should prove it has nothing to hide.    The program resumes at 1205 GMT after a two minute  commercial  break. Kim says normal relations existed between the DPRK and  the IAEA up until the Gulf war, but since then, the DPRK has  become a scapegoat, a subsequent target of U.S. strategy  following the attack against Iraq.    Asked if the DPRK would wage war if UN sanctions are  imposed,  Kim says the DPRK has only said that it would "respond to  dialogue with dialogue and war with war." However, he adds that  the DPRK would not be first to start a war.    At 1207 GMT, Tahara says the DPRK should be more open to  foreign journalists to reduce misunderstanding and prevent  incorrect information from circulating. He points out that  international political commentator Yoichi Masuzoe, who is one  of the regular guests on the program, has waited for two years  since submitting a request to Chongnyon to visit the DPRK. Kim  says the DPRK is concerned about DPRK bashing by foreign  journalists and that may be one reason for its cautious stance.  He says the actual situation in Pyongyang is calm and much  different from how it is being described by the Japanese news  media.    The interview ends at 1210 GMT.</p>

			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / International Company News: Macy rescue plan hits snag The board of RH Macy was convening yesterday after a last-minute glitch emerged in a plan to bring the company out of Chapter 11 protection. The conflict, centring on the valuation the company would place on itself in the reorganisation proposal, threatens to scupper a strategy designed to allow the New York-based department store chain to remain independent. In January, Federated Department Stores, a long-time rival, proposed a merger between the two groups and purchased Dollars 450m of Macy's highest ranking debt. The deal gave Federated considerable influence over Macy's future and the right to come up with a reorganisation plan. Until late last week, yesterday's board meeting was expected to endorse a proposal hammered out after weeks of negotiations between Macy's management and two of its most important secured creditors, GE Capital and Fidelity Investments. The package was intended to pay off both Federated and Prudential Insurance, which also holds about Dollars 450m in Macy's debt, and pave the way for a reorganised Macy to issue new equity to other secured creditors. Mr Cyrus Vance, the former US secretary of state who was appointed last month to mediate in the negotiations, would then review the proposal. However, a challenge to the management-sanctioned plan surfaced in the days leading up to yesterday's meeting. Mr Laurence Tisch, an influential outsider director, was expected to argue for a Dollars 3.8bn valuation for the company, compared with Dollars 3.5bn recommended by Macy's financial advisers. Under a Dollars 3.8bn valuation, public bondholders and other junior creditors would realise a greater return on their claims and receive a bigger proportion of the stock issued by the company when it emerges from Chapter 11. Senior creditors would receive less. As a consequence, some of them, led by Fidelity, are threatening to withdraw their support for Macy's independence if Mr Tisch wins. A letter signed by the group was sent to Mr Vance, warning him of their intention to back Federated unless the lower valuation was sanctioned by the board.</p>

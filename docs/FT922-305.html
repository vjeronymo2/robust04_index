			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / International Company News: Lalique takes 20% stake in porcelain maker LALIQUE, the French manufacturer of fine crystal, is expanding its porcelain interests by taking a 20 per cent stake in Bernardaud, a Limoges porcelain maker, writes Alice Rawsthorn. Bernardaud, like Lalique, is a family-controlled company. However, another 20 per cent of its equity is owned by Clinvest, part of the Credit Lyonnais banking group. The company's sales were FFr200m (Dollars 38m) last year. Lalique already has a foothold in the porcelain field with its Coquet business. It has not disclosed the value of the Bernardaud deal.</p>

			<p><P> September 22, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DONAHUE'S WORRY IS STOPPING WOLVERINES  </P> <P> UCLA Coach Terry Donahue is most concerned about his defensive unit in today's  game against Michigan.  </P> <P> The Bruins weren't able to stop Oklahoma's running attack, which is  understandable because that's what the Sooners do best. Nor were they able to  slow Stanford's ground game. They have yielded an average of 227 yards rushing  in those two games.  </P> <P> Now here comes Michigan, with its veteran offensive line averaging 290 pounds,  including tackle Greg Skrepenak, who weighs 322.  </P> <P> "Michigan's backs run harder than Stanford's backs," Donahue said. "They hammer  you, run over you. It's a different approach -- a hardball, smash-mouth  approach.  </P> <P> "My biggest concern is that they'll ball-control us to death."  </P> <P> UCLA's defensive problems are compounded by injuries.  </P> <P> Strong safety Matt Darby has a shoulder injury, and Donahue said his status is  marginal. Two of his right cornerbacks, Dion Lambert and Robert Gamble, are  playing despite injuries, and a third, Damion Lyons, didn't make the trip.  </P> <P> Moreover, UCLA will confront Michigan's massive offensive line with three  alternating nose guards -- Emanuel Onwutuebe, Kim Lawhorn and Matt Werner, who  are regarded as average players.  </P> <P> There is also the element of Michigan trying for its first victory for Coach  Gary Moeller, who replaced Bo Schembechler this season.  </P> <P> The Wolverines are still brooding over a 28-24 season-opening loss to  top-ranked Notre Dame, a game they let get away after leading, 24-14.  </P> <P> Throw in the factor of UCLA quarterback Tommy Maddox, a redshirt freshman  starting for the first time before an anticipated crowd of more than 100,000 at  Michigan Stadium, and Donahue can't get back to Pacific 10 competition fast  enough.  </P> <P> "I think our offense can match up with their defense, but I don't think our  defense matches up with their offense," Donahue said.  </P> <P> Michigan gained 443 yards against Notre Dame, sophomore tailback Jon Vaughn  running for 201 of them.  </P> <P> Quarterback Elvis Grbac threw a costly interception into the end zone while  Michigan was protecting a 24-21 lead. Still, he completed 17 of 30 passes for  190 yards and two touchdowns against the Irish.  </P> <P> Grbac started for the first time last year when Michigan beat UCLA, 24-23, at  the Rose Bowl in a game the Bruins maintain they should have won.  </P> <P> UCLA led, 23-15, in the fourth quarter when tailback Shawn Wills fumbled at the  Bruin 43-yard line. The Wolverines scored but failed on a two-point conversion  try.  </P> <P> With 1:35 remaining, Michigan tried an onside kick. It was a high kick that was  caught by Vada Murray at the UCLA 46. The Wolverines drove to the winning field  goal with one second left.  </P> <P> Some UCLA players say that the loss was a psychological factor in a 3-7-1  season.  </P> <P> Donahue isn't so sure.  </P> <P> "The Michigan game was like a lot of games we played last year. It was in  reach," he said, "but we didn't get it done. The Michigan game impacted our  team last year, but I would be disappointed in the mentality, or mental  toughness, of our players if after one loss early in the season we cashed it in  and quit playing football. I prefer not to think that's what happened. However,  if we had won, it would have made us a more confident team."  </P> <P> Moeller is eager for his first victory as Michigan's coach after serving as an  assistant to Schembechler for 17 years, a term that was interrupted when  Moeller coached Illinois coach from 1977 through '79.  </P> <P> Moeller sounded like Schembechler while rehashing the Notre Dame game.  </P> <P> "We have to tackle," Moeller said. "That wasn't Michigan defense out there. We  have to get back to that. A couple of key guys broke down in assignments, which  really hurt us. We have to get back to that old, fly-around Michigan defense."  </P> <P> As for UCLA, Moeller said: "They came from behind to beat Stanford, and they'll  come in here on a high note. We have to make sure we take some wind out of  their sails."  </P> <P> As it is, the Bruins aren't exactly breezing into Ann Arbor.  </P> <P> Bruin Notes  </P> <P> Michigan has a 6-2 overall record against UCLA and is 38-15-1 against Pacific  10 teams, with only USC breaking even, 4-4. . . . The Wolverines used a  no-huddle, hurry-up offense exclusively against Notre Dame last Saturday night.  . . . It rained heavily in Ann Arbor Friday. A chance of showers is forecast  for today.  </P> <P> UCLA quarterback Tommy Maddox said his high school games in Hurst, Tex.,  averaged 11,000 in attendance, and 23,000 watched one playoff game. He will be  playing before more than 100,000 today. His reaction: "I don't know. I've never  played before 100,000 before. But once you're on the field, you have to pay so  much attention to 11 guys on defense that you can't worry about what's going on  in the stands." . . . While leading UCLA to a 32-31 victory over Stanford in  the second half, Maddox completed nine consecutive fourth-quarter passes. On  five second-half possessions with Maddox at quarterback, the Bruins scored  three touchdowns, got the winning field goal and missed a field goal.  </P> <P> Tripp Welborne, Michigan's All-American strong safety, returned a punt 63 yards  to set up a touchdown in last season's game against UCLA. He returned four  punts a total of 77 yards against Notre Dame. Bruin Coach Terry Donahue  indicated that he will instruct punter Courtney Keyler to kick away from  Welborne -- as he kicked away from Glyn Milburn in the Stanford game. . . . Ken  Sollom, who participated in a 46-game winning streak while playing for Canyon  High in Canyon Country, backs up Elvis Grbac at quarterback for the Wolverines.  </P></p>

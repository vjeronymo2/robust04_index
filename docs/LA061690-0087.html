			<p><P> June 16, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OXNARD;  </P> <P> CHAMBER SUPPORTS POLICE, FIRE STUDY  </P> <P> The Oxnard Chamber of Commerce announced Friday that it supports a proposal to  study eliminating the city's police and fire departments and hiring county  agencies instead.  </P> <P> Councilwoman Ann Johs, who made the proposal, has said she believes that  Oxnard, which is facing a projected $2.8-million budget deficit, could save a  lot of money by hiring the Ventura County Sheriff's Department and Fire  Protection District.  </P> <P> Several other cities, including Thousand Oaks, Moorpark, Camarillo, Fillmore  and Ojai, contract with the county for these services.  </P> <P> "We believe that the city should seek bids and compare the cost and benefit of  providing services using personnel and equipment, compared to buying these  services from specialized companies by competitive bids," chamber President  George Lauterbach said. "We need to know if we are getting the best bang for  our buck."  </P> <P> Chamber Vice President Stephen Maulhardt cited voters' defeat June 5 of a 5%  utility tax increase as a clear indication that the council "needs to explore  some real innovative and creative methods of cutting costs and solving the  budget crunch."  </P> <P> Johs is expected to explain her proposal to the council in detail Tuesday.

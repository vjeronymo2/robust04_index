			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Carmakers optimistic despite signals CAR and commercial vehicle production has made an 'encouraging' start to the year, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said yesterday. But statistics for January released by the SMMT and Central Statistical Office showed no firm signs of the output growth in cars that the SMMT has forecast for this year. It has predicted that the UK-based industry will make 1.4m cars this year, 110,000 more than in 1992. Car output rose by 14.57 per cent on a year-on-year basis last month to 109,124 from 95,245, the SMMT said. Direct comparisons are difficult, however, mainly because January this year covered five weeks' production compared with four last year. Seasonally adjusted figures compiled by the CSO show last month's car output to be marginally lower than in the same month last year - 99,400 against 100,700. But production in the current and coming months is expected to increasingly to feel the benefit of the introduction of Toyota's car plant at Burnaston, Derbyshire, and Honda's plan at Swindon, Wiltshire, and also of Nissan's planned output growth. Rover Group stated this week that it is doubling Maestro and Montego output, and will soon start production of the 600, its own version of the Accord that Honda has begun building at Swindon. Rover's contention that it is increasing output mainly to cope with higher export demand appears to be supported by yesterday's statistics. They show production for export, at 50,292, up 21.21 per cent from the previous January's 41,492. Commercial vehicle output in the month rose 14.81 per cent to 16,400, but with production for export down 3.09 per cent to 9,734. The CSO's seasonally adjusted total commercial vehicle figures showed that output was down 2.2 per cent. This month's commercial vehicle figures are almost certain to be badly affected by the halting of production at UK truck market leader Leyland Daf, following its collapse into receivership.</p>

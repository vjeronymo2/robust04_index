			<p><P> January 26, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ESCONDIDO TAKES REINS OF RECYCLING WITH TRASH PLAN  </P> <P> Until recently, Escondido residents could take their recyclable trash to the  Noon Optimist Club salvage center, earn a little pin money and know their  efforts were aiding local youth projects. But the center closed.  </P> <P> In the near future, those same householders will be putting their salable trash  at the curb and paying the city to pick it up.  </P> <P> It is the way of the future in this era of garbage glut, said Mike Little, the  Escondido city staffer in charge of turning the proposed citywide recycling  plan into reality.  </P> <P> Little, who hopes to have the voluntary recycling program operating by May,  believes that such programs soon will become mandatory as local governments  scramble to meet new state standards that require that 25% of all trash be  recycled by 1995.  </P> <P> Escondido's plan has been about a year in the making, Little said, and has  borrowed ideas from other California communities already in the recycling  business: bright-colored containers for residents' recycled trash, modest  per-household fees to cover the collection costs and educational programs  appealing to the residents' environmental concerns.  </P> <P> Although the Noon Optimist Club's center closed after 18 years because of a  combination of management problems and falling prices for recyclable items,  other centers remain open. Residents can still sell their trash to one of  these, but it does not absolve them from paying the city fee.  </P> <P> County solid waste management officials emphasize the growing trash problem by  citing statistics that show that per capita trash volume has grown 40% in  recent years.  </P> <P> The crunch was made official when Gov. George Deukmejian signed into law last  fall a bill that mandates 25% recycling by all local governments by 1995 and  50% recycling by 2000.  </P> <P> Brooke Nash, who heads Solana Recyclers, is a veteran in the recycling business  and converted Solana Beach (1983) and Del Mar (l987) into two of the first 100%  recycling cities in the county where commercial, industrial and residential  properties all participate on a voluntary basis.  </P> <P> Encinitas is going to full recycling in a few months, and other cities,  including Carlsbad, San Marcos and La Mesa, are gearing up for citywide  recycling.  </P> <P> Escondido, which has had a pilot program of about 500 homes operating since  last May, plans to phase in its citywide residential program in May. About  7,500 of the city's 22,100 single-family homes will be served in the first  phase, followed by a midsummer expansion and total coverage in November.  </P> <P> Escondido City Council members gave the program a vote of approval after a  workshop Wednesday night but requested that the city staff work out a few kinks  in the system and investigate a "carrot and stick" approach to reward  participants in the curbside recycling program and penalize bleacher sitters.  </P> <P> Nash said that no such system has been tried in coastal cities because of the  difficulty in keeping records and the unfairness of penalizing persons who take  their recyclable trash to salvage centers.  </P> <P> She said curbside recycling programs alone will not meet the 1995 requirement  for recycling 25% of the trash generated within a city. Grass clippings and  other organic wastes, which make up 20%-30% of all solid waste -- must be  recycled into mulch and ground cover before such recycling levels can be met.  </P> <P> County officials are considering banning the dumping of greenery in landfills,  requiring instead that it be separated and dumped at chipping centers situated  at landfills, Nash said.  </P> <P> Under the curbside recycling program proposed for Escondido, residents would  pay $1.37 a month, picking up some city administrative costs and most  collection costs.  </P> <P> The city would face start-up costs of about $380,000 to acquire recycling  containers and to set up the program. Escondido Disposal Inc., which handles  trash pickup in the city, would face an equal amount of start-up costs,  including acquisition of new equipment.  </P> <P> Little estimated that the recycled materials would bring in $15,000 to $50,000  a year in city revenue, which could be applied toward the cost of the program.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 11, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACK: CHERRY DEBUTS IN SASSY STYLE;  </P> <P> VAN MORRISON'S SOLID 'SUNSET'; KOOL MOE DEE BOASTS OF 'KNOWLEDGE'; THE STYLES  OF NATALIE COLE  </P> <P> NENEH CHERRY  </P> <P> "Raw Like Sushi." Virgin. ****: POP STARS ***** Great Balls of Fire ****  Knockin' On Heaven's Door *** Good Vibrations ** Maybe Baby * Ain't That a  Shame  </P> <P> Sassy, silly, socially aware, hep-talking, hip-hopping and above all headstrong  -- this is singer/rapper Neneh Cherry, who, on the strength of her debut album,  could and should be the next superstar of black music, a genre that could use a  female superstar or two.  </P> <P> Her astonishingly fine and vital "Raw Like Sushi" dips into any number of great  pop traditions -- from early soul to modern scratching and sampling -- but  bears the unmistakable stamp of a unique, living, breathing human who would  eventually have to be invented if she didn't already exist.  </P> <P> The lead track, "Buffalo Stance," may be the year's best single, good for  instant replay after replay with its tough, sweet street-talk and a brilliantly  mixed-for-stereo synthesizer obbligato that won't quit. This offers a tease of  what's best about the whole LP: The way Cherry moves from a rapped verse into a  sung chorus and back again has all the charming ease of the way the best movie  musicals effortlessly glide from dialogue into extravagant production numbers.  </P> <P> Though Cherry is English, her accent sounds unaffectedly New Yawk-ish at times,  which doesn't hurt the gritty feel of the Big Apple-focused "Inner City Mamma."  </P> <P> And when you think of comparisons here, you think of the greats: the ballad  "Manchild" sounds like something man-child Michael Jackson himself might have  come up with, only more melodically inventive; "The Next Generation" and "So  Here I Come" are innovative party blowouts that recall the finest Prince jams;  the slicker "Heart" sounds like what Diana Ross would be doing if she still had  integrity, and the way Cherry reads the signs o' the times -- on everything  from urban depression to the cautions and celebrations of childbirth to "sexual  survival" -- easily puts her in Marvin Gaye's class.  </P> <P> Is this the essential dance long-player of the year or what?  </P> <P> SI CHRIS WILLMAN  </P></p>

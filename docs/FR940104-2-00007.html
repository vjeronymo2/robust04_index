			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Issues <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Tentatively, several issues of concern have been identified through the scoping process. These issues are briefly described below: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Whitetailed and Mule Deer Winter Thermal Cover_How would the proposed action maintain and enhance winter thermal cover? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Visuals_What effects would the proposed action have on naturally appearing views seen from trails, private land, Dickey Lake and Highway 93? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Timber Supply_How would the proposed action help satisfy local and national needs? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Activity in Roadless Area_What effect would the proposal have on the roadless character of Marston Face and Thompson-Seton Roadless Areas. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Grizzly Bear_How would the proposal maintain and enhance grizzly bear habitat? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Old Growth_What effect would the proposed action have on old growth habitat? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Forest Health_Some stands are not growing at their full potential and some have sustained heavy mortality due to the mountain pine beetle. What effect would the proposed action have to reduce susceptibility to bark beetles and improve stand conditions? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Water Quality_What effects would the proposed action have on riparian areas, lakes, and private water developments? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Public Involvement and Scoping <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Public participation to this point has been extensive. On August 15, 1991 an initial scoping meeting was held with the local community and interested individuals for the development of a timber sale proposal. On May 28, 1992 we held another open house to present a revised proposal. In addition, a field trip to the Murphy Decision Area was conducted on June 26, 1992 with seven individuals attending. Comments were requested in writing during all of these public involvement efforts. Consultation with appropriate State and Federal agencies has been initiated. Preliminary effects analysis indicated that the proposed action may significantly affect quality of the human environment and may substantially alter the undeveloped character of the Marston Face Roadless Area. These potential effects prompted the decision to prepare an EIS for the Murphy Timber Sales. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This environmental analysis and decision making process will unable additional interested and affected people to participate and contribute to the final decision. Public participation will be requested at several points during the analysis. The Forest Service will be seeking information, comments, and assistance from Federal, State, local agencies and other individuals or organizations who may be interested in or affected by the proposed projects. This input will be used in preparation of the draft and final EIS. The scoping process will include: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Identifying potential issues. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Identifying major issues to be analyzed in depth. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Exploring additional alternatives which will be derived from issues recognized during scoping activities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Identifying potential environmental effects of this project and alternatives (i.e. direct, indirect, and cumulative effects and connected actions). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The analysis will consider a range of alternatives, including the proposed action, no action, and other reasonable action alternatives.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Estimated Dates for Filing <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The draft Murphy EIS is expected to be filed with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and to be available for public review by September, 1994. At that time EPA will publish a Notice of Availability of the draft EIS in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The comment period on the draft EIS will be 45 days from the date the EPA publishes the Notice of Availability in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The final EIS is scheduled to be completed by December, 1994. In the final EIS, the Forest Service is required to respond to comments and responses received during the comment period that pertain to the environmental consequences discussed in the draft EIS and applicable laws, regulations, and policies considered in making a decision regarding the proposal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Reviewer's Obligations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Forest Service believes, at this early stage, it is important to give reviewers notice of several court rulings related to public participation in the environmental review process. First, reviewers of draft environmental impact statements must structure their participation in the environmental review of the proposal so that it is meaningful and alerts an agency to the reviewer's position and contentions.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> versus  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> NRDC,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 435 U.S. 519, 553 (1978). Also, environmental objections that could be raised at the draft environmental impact statement stage may be waived or dismissed by the courts.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> City of Angoon  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> versus  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Hodel <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 803 F.2d 1016, 1022 (9th Cir. 1986) and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Wisconsin Heritages, Inc.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> versus  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Harris <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 490 F. Supp. 1334, 1338 (E.D. Wis. 1980). Because of these court rulings, it is very important that those interested in this proposed action participate by the close of the 45 day comment period so that substantive comments and objections are made available to the Forest Service at a time when it can meaningfully consider and respond to them in the final EIS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To be most helpful, comments on the draft EIS should be as specific as possible and may address the adequacy of the statement or the merit of the alternatives discussed. Reviewers may wish to refer to the Council on Environmental Quality regulations for implementing the procedural provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act at 40 CFR 1503.3 in addressing these points. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Responsible Official <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Jane P.

As the Responsible Official I will decide which, if any, of the proposed projects will be implemented. I will document the decision and reasons for the decision in the Record of Decision. That decision will be subject to Forest Service Appeal Regulations.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: December 16, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Jane P.

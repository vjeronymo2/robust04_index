			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / World Trade News: China air space rows 'bad for business' - Disputes with Moscow and Seoul over flight jurisdiction Two air space disputes are souring China's otherwise good economic relations with South Korea and Russia. Under pressure from foreign airlines seeking both to take advantage of the economic boom in China and cut costs and flying time across the Pacific Ocean, diplomats are pushing Beijing to resolve these longstanding disagreements. Of the two, the most knotty involves differences over the air space between Beijing and Seoul. It has meant that there are currently no direct scheduled flights between the Chinese and South Korean capitals. 'In terms of business, both sides are losing fantastic amounts of money,' a western airline executive said. 'Scheduled charters from South Korea are full. Everybody wants to come here, but the Chinese say do it under their terms or not at all.' The obstacles in the dispute are primarily commercial issues. Neither side can agree either on the frequency of flights that should operate between Beijing and Seoul or the number of destinations to which carriers could fly. Aviation experts say Chinese airlines fear that if there were enough flights from South Korea to meet the growing demand, few passengers would opt to fly Chinese airlines, which have a poor reputation. To pressure Chinese authorities to resolve these issues, South Korea recently lifted its official ban on tourism travel to China. Last year, between 100,000 and 120,000 Koreans visited the mainland for business or official purposes. Travel agencies expect tourism traffic to push this figure up to 500,000 a year. A significant hurdle in what is known as the '124-125 fight' was cleared during the recent visit to China by South Korean President Kim Young-Sam. The Chinese agreed to the South Koreans' demand that the air traffic control boundary remain at 124 degrees east longitude as laid down by the Montreal-based International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) for regularly scheduled flights between Beijing and Seoul. South Korea had argued that a one-degree extension of Beijing's air space would give China control virtually to the South Korean coast. However, Chinese officials are still standing by their claim that the air traffic control region between Shanghai and Seoul should stay at 125 degrees for chartered flights. While the Koreans are reportedly unhappy with this arrangement, they are willing to accept it for the present. With the trade boom between China and South Korea, pressure on both sides to find a solution has risen. Bilateral trade between the two countries soared 63 per cent to Dollars 23bn (Pounds 15.3bn) in the first nine months last year. Korean Airlines is also pushing the government to resolve the impasse. If direct flights between Beijing and Seoul were allowed, Seoul could become an international hub in north-east Asia. Airlines seeking to shorten the long haul across the Pacific have also run into trouble over a Sino-Russian dispute dealing with restrictions on air space along their eastern border. Details of the dispute remain unclear and Chinese officials have been unwilling to discuss the matter. What is known is that some western airlines are permitted to refuel in the Siberian city of Khaborovsk, but are not allowed to cross the border there and enter directly into China's north-eastern Heilongjiang province. Instead, they must fly back down across Japan and on to Beijing, adding considerable time to their journey. Chinese airlines are also frustrated by this roundabout route. There is concern that Russian and Chinese air traffic control systems may be inadequate to handle a higher volume of traffic if the corridor were open to foreign carriers. Currently, both countries can handle an aircraft every half hour but opening to foreign carriers would mean an aircraft entering Sino-Russian air space every two and a half minutes. Aviation experts say this ought not to be a problem. Modern aircraft do not need ultra-sophisticated air traffic control systems. They can use satellite navigation once they reach cruising altitude. Some western airline officials are 'cautiously optimistic' that China's differences with Russia will be resolved sooner than those with South Korea.</p>

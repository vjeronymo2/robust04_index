			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Doubts cast on Quebec independence referendum Quebec separatists have begun to raise doubts about their commitment to hold an early referendum on independence from Canada, barely a week after winning elections in the French-speaking province by an unexpectedly narrow margin. Mr Lucien Bouchard, leader of the Bloc Quebecois, whose 53 MPs promote the separatist cause in the federal House of Commons in Ottawa, said the referendum would not be held until the pro-independence forces were likely to win. 'There is no way the sovereignists will engage in a losing referendum,' Mr Bouchard said. Mr Bouchard's remarks contradict pledges during the election campaign by Mr Jacques Parizeau, leader of the Parti Quebecois, the party which will form the next government in the French-speaking province. Mr Parizeau said at one time the referendum would be held within 8-10 months of the election. But he gave himself more latitude in the closing stages of the campaign by promising a vote 'sometime in 1995'. Although the PQ won 77 of the 125 seats in Quebec's National Assembly, it garnered only fractionally more of the popular vote than the defeated Liberals. Many voters who supported the PQ in the election do not necessarily favour outright independence. A poll of Quebec voters in by the Globe and Mail newspaper yesterday showed that 48.8 per cent of respondents would vote against independence in a referendum, compared to only 35.8 per cent in favour of independence. Political observers have also interpreted the signals put out by Mr Bouchard and Mr Parizeau as evidence of divisions which have long been suspected within the separatist ranks. Mr Bouchard, who is in his early 50s, is widely seen as Mr Parizeau's most likely successor should the PQ leader, aged 64, stumble over the independence issue. Business leaders both in and outside Quebec have urged the new PQ government to hold the referendum as quickly as possible to lift uncertainty over Canada's political future. Mr Ghislain Dufour, president of the Patronat, Quebec's main employer group, said: 'Our members want the political uncertainty now weighing down on Quebec lifted as soon as possible. The sooner the debate is over the better.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Mirian Murdzhikneli, first deputy minister </F> of finances, by Spartak Nikolaishvili; place and date not given:  "In Pursuit of Prices"]    [Text]Statistics inexorably show: Over 90 percent of  the republic's population are living below the poverty line. As  Head of State E. Shevardnadze has emphasized, a catastrophic  disparity has arisen between standard of living, prices, and  wages. A person here now receives on average less than 100,000  coupons [per month] while, in order to sustain at least a  minimum standard of living, according to specialists, the  standard wage should be 9.3 million coupons.  How can we eliminate this extremely negative discrepancy  and what can the state do in order to help people to survive in  this extreme situation? We raised these questions with Mirian  Murdzhikneli, first deputy minister of finances.    [Murdzhikneli] There can be no doubt that social policy  should form the principal element in the government's  activities; it is essential to implement at once measures aimed  at increasing the population's standard of living. As is known,  in January, there was a 100 percent increase in wages in all  budgetary organizations and a 150 percent increase in pensions  and benefits. Since 1 February, teachers' salaries have  increased two to threefold.    [Nikolaishvili] Nevertheless, during this time, prices  have rocketed so much that this increase has, to all intents and  purposes, been nullified. Furthermore, the coupon is falling at  a catastrophic rate before our very eyes.    [Murdzhikneli] Yes, given current hyperinflation, even a  wage that has increased threefold does not constitute a living  wage. In order to alleviate somehow the destructive effect of  inflation, it has been decided to increase the wages of workers  in budgetary organizations on a monthly basis by 20 percent as  of 1 March of this year. Of course, this will not bring about  cardinal changes in the standard of living but, nevertheless....    [Nikolaishvili] For how long can wages be made to keep  up this vain chase after prices? After all, it is patently  clear that we will always be on the losing side....    [Murdzhikneli] Yes, until we get production going again and  until there are sufficient goods on whose purchase at least  50-60 percent of the wage fund can be spent. After all, almost  nothing is currently being produced; there is nothing in the  shops; we are forcibly chained to the market where speculators  reign supreme and jack up prices at their leisure. Notice that,  as a rule, genuine peasants are being pushed off the territory  of the market and very often forced to raise their prices.  Furthermore, the market has haphazardly gone over to trading  only in rubles and made the coupon literally worthless.    [Nikolaishvili] Yet, measures have been taken to  strengthen the coupon....    [Murdzhikneli] They are still demanding in Parliament today  that we propose some emergency measures in this respect. What  can you propose in the circumstances? The republic should start  working and producing goods. That's the first thing. Second,  all economic ties should be restored with the former Union  republics, first and foremost, with Russia. Up to now, we have  been destroying everything with a stubbornness that could be put  to better use and have imposed a self-blockade. However, it is  clear today that we cannot survive without Russia.    [Nikolaishvili] A final question concerning the  budget. Can one hope that the social measures you have outlined  will find reliable support in the state's financial law?    [Murdzhikneli] Absolutely. Expenditure on the indexation of  the population's losses that lead to inflation has already been  included in the budget for the second quarter. True, there are  certain complications with implementing the income part of the  budget; the mechanism for levying taxes has not been properly  developed. No one wants to pay on time while there are plenty  of people who are keen to have more money.</p>

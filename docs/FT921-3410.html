			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar fails to meet promise THE DOLLAR had a subdued day to end a week which left dealers puzzled at its failure to take advantage of unexpectedly strong US economic data, writes Neil Buckley. Selling of dollars for yen, rumours about intervention from the Bank of Japan, and calls from Japanese ministers for a stronger yen all affected market sentiment, and the US currency confounded analysts' predictions to end the week with a  1/2 -pfennig loss. The market paid surprisingly little attention to a sharp increase in the University of Nichigan consumer confidence survey to 74.6 from 68.8. Dealers said the Japanese were trying to push the value of the yen up towards the end of the financial year at the end of March to increase the value of Japanese companies' overseas assets. Both the finance and industry ministers suggested that the yen's recent fall against the dollar was not in line with economic fundamentals, and that a rate of Y120 was more appropriate. The dollar closed at DM1.6685/90 after a DM1.6695/6705 start, and a DM1.6717/27 finish in Asia. It ended the previous week at DM1.6730/40. Against the yen, it stood at Y1233.50/60, from a Y133.35/45 start and a Y133.60/70 Asian close, but was still well above the previous week's London close of Y131.80/90. Mr David Deakin of Nikko Bank in London said he was surprised. 'Maybe everyone is as long as they want to be in the dollar at the moment,' he said, adding that dealers were perhaps waiting for more US economic data to prove the recovery was under way. 'In the medium term, the dollar has the mileage to go a lot higher, but in the short term it doesn't seem to have the get-up-and-go.' In Tokyo, the dollar had traded lower against the yen and D-mark after several bouts of selling. In the EMS, more political jitters after an opinion poll showed the UK Labour party three points ahead of the ruling Conservatives pushed sterling down a third of a pfennig to DM2.8535/55 from DM2.8562/97 on Thursday. It remained pinned to its effective floor against the peseta, which it has dragged down with it. Sterling dropped to 53 per cent of its permitted divergence below its central Ecu rate, a two-month low, from 50 per cent on Thursday. Dealers said only sterling's membership of the ERM, with the threat of Bank of England intervention should it fall below its peseta floor, was slowing its fall. They warned it was not inconceivable that further Labour advances in the opinion polls could push it right down to its absolute floor in the ERM at DM2.7780. Against the dollar, however, sterling recovered to Dollars 1.7112, from a previous close of Dollars 1.7055.</p>

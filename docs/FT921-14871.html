			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / Fresh financial scandal hits Japan THE ARREST last night of a former Japanese cabinet minister for alleged bribe-taking has raised serious doubts about the leadership of Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister. The latest in a series of financial scandals to hit Japan. the arrest has also added weight to popular perceptions that Japanese politics remains riddled with corruption. Mr Fumio Abe, 69, a senior member of the ruling Liberal Democratic party (LDP), was charged with having received Y80m (Dollars 630,000) from Kyowa Corp, a property developer, in return for providing the company with confidential planning information, and for unlawfully assisting it to obtain low-interest loans. The arrest is particularly embarrassing for Mr Miyazawa, since the high-profile Mr Abe was secretary-general of the prime minister's faction until last month. Mr Abe also played an important role in the campaign leading up to the premier's appointment. Last night Mr Miyazawa described the arrest of Mr Abe as 'regrettable', but denied an allegation that the Miyazawa faction ultimately received Y120m in 'political donations' given to Mr Abe by Kyowa. The prime minister said action would be taken to prevent a recurrence of bribery scandals, but provided no details of his plans. Mr Abe checked himself into a Tokyo hospital yesterday, but prosecutors decided that he was capable of answering questions. Other investigators raided his home and offices. The alleged bribes, part of an estimated Y500m given to Mr Abe by Kyowa, apparently took place after he became director general of the Hokkaido Development Agency in August 1989. At this time he was a member of the so-called 'clean cabinet' of Mr Toshiki Kaifu, former prime minister. Mr Abe's home is in Hokkaido, the northernmost of Japan's main islands, and Kyowa, which had been a maker of steel frames, was interested in development projects on the island. It is alleged that Mr Abe's office provided confidential information about a planned motorway, and that Kyowa intended to buy property along the route. It is also alleged that Kyowa, which collapsed with outstanding debts of Y200bn in late 1990, was given confidential information about a proposed stadium complex in Hokkaido and received assistance from Mr Abe in obtaining low-interest loans from Hokkaido-Tohoku Corp, a semi-government institution. The case again highlights the chronic problem of 'money politics', cited as the cause of the Recruit stocks-for-favours scandal which led to the resignation of Mr Noboru Takeshita as prime minister in April 1989. Parliamentarians complain that Japanese politics is an expensive business, and that even well-meaning politicians are tempted to take illegal donations. Mr Abe allegedly used Kyowa money to pay off debts and to fund a re-election campaign.</p>

			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / Personal View: Political mileage from motorway tolls Few experienced political observers could have been surprised by the recent highly critical report produced by the Commons' transport select committee on government plans to introduce tolls for UK motorway users. For the average MP, any suggestion that millions of car-owning voters should be compelled to pay for using roads that were hitherto 'free', has long been regarded as electoral dynamite. Both Tory and Labour MPs, therefore, have joined forces to chorus disapproval for a scheme which they fear could eclipse rail privatisation as the ultimate 'poll tax on wheels'. Even the government itself has decided that any decision to introduce tolls should be delayed until 1998, well after the next general election. Meanwhile, in the real world, congestion continues to grow on motorways which are breaking up under the pressure of traffic; vehicles emit gases that pose an increasing threat to public health; and public transport usage declines for lack of sufficient investment. Somewhere between the solid wall of opposition to motorway tolls and the threadbare state of Britain's transport systems lies a political void that needs urgently to be filled. Much of the debate on road tolling has centred on the economic costs and benefits, but it is the political problems of motorway tolling that should be given highest priority. If these can be overcome, the system offers great potential benefits. First, there is the question of the numbers affected by motorway tolls. In favour of tolls is the fact that, as the government's 1993 green paper on tolling pointed out, about half of drivers rarely or never use the motorways. This can be contrasted with the 100 per cent who would be compelled to pay any increases in fuel duty, one of the suggested revenue-raising alternatives. Second, one of the chief concerns of the select committee is the fear that motorway tolls would result in a large amount of traffic being diverted on to other roads. The government could, however, 'sugar the pill' for those who regularly use the motorways. For example, the smart cards that would be used to operate the system of electronic charging could give the motorist access to information on traffic conditions and weather reports. In any case, the evidence from European countries such as France, where motorway tolls are common, suggests that the degree of diversion on to untolled roads becomes negligible after a short transitional period. Third, and of crucial political importance, would be to decide how the toll revenues actually should be spent. At the moment, the proposal is that any proceeds should be used to expand the motorway and trunk road network. Politically, this is a narrow and short-sighted perspective. As the government's latest trunk roads review conceded, it now takes more than 13 years to complete a typical national road scheme. Consequently, it could be many years before those who pay the tolls actually see any results for their money. The toll system would also be locked into the increasingly controversial road-building programme that frequently arouses heated opposition from those affected by the proposed roads and members of environmental groups. It would be better for toll revenues to be earmarked for specific developments on existing motorways, such as maintenance, improvements in information, lighting and safety. In this way, motorists could see a quick return for their money, but without attracting political controversy. A far more valuable political aim for the government, however, would be to seek to use toll revenues to bridge the yawning gap that currently separates the road and environmental lobbies. Although it might mean creating yet another quango, the two sides could be brought together in a body that would allocate money to a range of deserving projects. These could include research on vehicle emissions and safety, grants for the building of urban light rail systems, the development of bus lanes and pedestrianisation schemes, and traffic calming in suburban areas. In this way, a direct link could be made between tolls and benefits to the community as a whole. For an imaginative government, therefore, motorway tolls need not be regarded as an automatic electoral liability. In any case, Britain's growing transport problems are likely to keep the subject on the political agenda, regardless of the party in power.

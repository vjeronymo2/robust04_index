			<p><P> April 3, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CEAUSESCU'S BROTHER DENIES MURDER AND GENOCIDE CHARGES AT START OF TRIAL  </P> <P> The brother of executed dictator Nicolae Ceausescu denied murder and genocide  charges Monday at the beginning of one of the most high-profile trials since  the December revolution.  </P> <P> Gen. Nicolae Andruta Ceausescu, who faces a maximum sentence of life  imprisonment if convicted, is the closest Ceausescu relative to stand trial for  crimes stemming from Communist dictator's rule.  </P> <P> He was given the name Andruta to distinguish him from his older brother, whom  he closely resembles.  </P> <P> The former chief of a security police training unit is accused of shooting to  death seven people Dec. 21 during heavy fighting between loyalist forces and  anti-government demonstrators. Ceausescu's regime fell the next day. He also is  charged with inciting others to commit genocide, attempted murder and weapons  offenses.  </P> <P> Prosecutors said they will produce witnesses who saw Gen. Ceausescu shoot seven  people in the crowd outside the Intercontinental Hotel in Bucharest. He  maintained he fired into the air.  </P> <P> "I fired five or six bullets -- a whole magazine -- into the air," Ceausescu  said, adding he could not have killed anyone because he was behind the security  forces and could not have shot through them.  </P> <P> The defendant, dressed in a brown-and-gray striped prison uniform, appeared  nervous during the court appearance, grinding his teeth, rocking in his chair  and shaking slightly. As he entered the courtroom he began to cry on seeing his  daughter, who has not been permitted to visit her father.  </P></p>

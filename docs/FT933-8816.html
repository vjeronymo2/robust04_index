			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / Nation in need of team spirit: Two of a kind - How bishops are responding to the divisions within their countries David Sheppard, bishop of Liverpool, is an admonitory priest, but not a dismal one. He has the churchman's ability to see light amid the darkness. Displaying the steadiness with which he played cricket for England between 1950 and 1963, the bishop has warned Conservative governments for more than a decade about the depredations of unemployment. The Church of England's standard-bearer in the city since 1975, he declared in a celebrated BBC lecture in 1984 that poverty and unemployment were causing 'sick human relationships' and 'a deeply divided nation'. Now, as he analyses the latest long UK recession, the bishop spots a small, perverse chink of optimism. People living in middle-class, non-manufacturing areas of Britain, who were mostly insulated from the previous downturn in the early 1980s, this time round have borne their share of joblessness. So, although no one (including the bishop) has a miracle solution for unemployment, at least nearly everyone now knows what it is like. 'In a curious sense this recession has something more hopeful about it, in that it is affecting a wider circle of people. This time, I think there's a better chance that the nation might accept that unemployment is a real problem. Before, I thought the nation was sweeping the problem away.' In the drawing room of his airy Victorian residence, he illustrates the point with a tale from a relatively prosperous district in his diocese. 'Someone told me the other day of a well-educated young man from that parish who's just written off for his 300th job.' He is a grey-haired 64, but there is still a hint of batsman's muscle rippling beneath his purple bishop's shirt. He confesses that, at his bedside (presumably next to another Good Book), he keeps a copy of the Wisden cricket almanac. If he were prime minister, how would the bishop of Liverpool bring down unemployment? 'Sharing work round', he says, would be high on the agenda. 'We are going enormously in the opposite direction. We're getting a pattern where there's a small core staff, working enormously hard with very high salaries. Around them, there's a broad group of people moving jobs constantly, often in part-time jobs. And, around them, there are people outside the work structure altogether. 'In quite a lot of big outer estates in Merseyside we're into the second or third generation of mass unemployment. From a Christian perspective, what is apparent is the sheer waste of human gifts, and destructiveness of human dignity.' There is a 'blindingly obvious connection' between unemployment and crime. Young people need role models: 'If they don't see men, younger or older ones, having creative things to do, you've taken away the greatest weapon for stopping boredom and destructive behaviour.' After 18 years on Merseyside, the bishop sees the world through Liverpudlian eyes. As a result of long-term economic stagnation, he points out how Liverpool's black community has far more difficulty than in London in breaking down jobs barriers. 'The year I came here, they picketed the stores in the centre of Liverpool, saying black people don't get jobs here. Nothing has changed too much. 'A group of young people from here went to London for the weekend and came back eyes shining, saying: 'Black people drive buses in London.' I've not yet seen a black bus driver here.' There is a diffident note to his conversation. Perhaps his lack of directness is partly because bishops know that, if they want to have any influence at all in notoriously secular Britain, they cannot simply bang on the table and talk about God but have to employ the more diffuse language of market economics. Has the Church been too hesitant in speaking out about the battle between good and evil? 'I do think there is a struggle and always has been. I think the Church sometimes has been a little diffident. I don't want to produce a crude statement. Nevertheless I do believe there are forces of evil.' He points to the former Yugoslavia. 'It's frightening how a group can lead people into destructive attitudes where an individual might not.' Three years ago, many people thought Bishop Sheppard's brand of gentlemanly populism would make him the ideal candidate to take over as archbishop of Canterbury on the retirement of Robert Runcie. Why didn't he get the job? Slightly embarrassed, he replies: 'There was a lot of talk about it. My wife and I said: 'Come on, we'd better stop and think what we would do.' Having taken a proper look, I thought: 'If that comes my way, yes, I can see the challenge and excitement as well as the rough stuff.' ' However, when Bishop George Carey was chosen, he says, 'I felt an overriding sense of relief'. The debate about the Lambeth Palace succession came at around the same time as a new incumbent moved to 10 Downing Street. He is pleased that John Major has abandoned some of the more simplistic nostrums of his predecessor. 'The aggressive confidence that wealth creation is all and, if only we can produce that, it will trickle down through society, and the market will decide: the doctrinaire view of that has softened very greatly, although it hasn't all gone. I don't deny the strength of market forces, and I'm absolutely clear you can't ignore them. But we need to build in other forces, of a social market if you like, with other priorities.' How these priorities should be reordered is not within the bishop's gift to determine. He can put his finger on society's ills. Healing them is a matter for the wider world beyond his pulpit.

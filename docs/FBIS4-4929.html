			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Yu Sang-o: "The Effective Use of Soot Is an </F> Important Way To Save and Mobilize Fuel Reserves"]    [Summary] The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught  on increasing production by effective use of labor, facilities,  and materials.    "One of the important problems in the present  produce-more-and-save-more struggle and in inner reserve  mobilization is to save as much fuel as possible and obtain more  reserves."    In order to mobilize greater reserves of fuel in conformity  with the rapid increase in fuel demand, "we should extensively  conduct work to save not only the fuel for production purposes  but the fuel for consumer uses as well."    "One of the ways to save fuel for consumer use is to  effectively use soot [yonjae] based on the great leader's  teaching and the party's intent."    "Soot, which is used for various fields, such as  construction  material industry, agriculture, and metal industry, thanks to  the development of science and technology, is used to save and  mobilize the reserve of fuel for consumer use as well."    "Taking into account the number of families of residents  using coal and petroleum, we know we can obtain considerable  fuel reserves by saving the fuel for consumer use."    "The use of soot enables us to save coal for consumer use."    "Soot contains unburnt coal [miyonsotan] which can give off  energy in the process of secondary burning, therefore, if we  properly use it for the production of coal briquettes by mixing  it with coal, we can save considerable quantity of coal for  consumer use. If we separate unburnt coal from soot and add the  relevant quantity to general soot, we can make coal briquette  without using other coal at all. If we use coal briquette by  burning it in a fire box which can retain heat well, we can cook  rice and heat the room quickly."    "The use of soot enables us to save petroleum for consumer  use as well."    There are inexhaustible sources of soot in the country, in  the power plants, and in boilers at plants and enterprises,  therefore, there are good prospects for saving fuel.    The problem of primary importance in mobilizing and  utilizing  this fuel saving reserve is to effectively conduct the work of  separating unburnt coal from soot.    "To attain major success in the active campaign to save fuel  for consumer use through the effective use of soot, we must  enhance the role of functionaries in the administrative and  economic organizations and in the fuel supply sector."    "The more we make it possible to save fuel for consumer use,  the more we can utilize it for production and construction in  various sectors of the people's economy, and the better can we  promote the expedience of the residents' life."    "The functionaries should solve on their own the problems in  utilizing soot for consumer fuel displaying the revolutionary  spirit of self-reliance and fortitude and contribute to a  smoother solution to the fuel problem."</p>

			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / International Company News: Dutch paper group posts profits down by 75% KNP BT, the big Dutch paper and packaging group created out of a three-way merger last month, saw net profits plummet by nearly 75 per cent in 1992, underlying the difficult market conditions facing the new company. Combined pro forma net profit for the three merger partners - the Dutch companies KNP, Buhrmann-Tetterode and VRG - fell to Fl 116m (Dollars 64.6m) from Fl 443m in 1991. If extraordinary items are excluded, net profit declined by 64 per cent to Fl 175m from Fl 489m a year earlier. The three companies warned of falling profits in November when they announced plans to merge. Overall, group operating profit was down 42 per cent at Fl 538m. Sales increased by 2.2 per cent to Fl 11.76bn. KNP BT said yesterday there were few signs of improvement in its main markets.</p>

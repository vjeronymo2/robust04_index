			<p>BFN     [Text] Shanghai, June 1 (XINHUA) -- Shanghai's exhibition  halls will be expanded by ten times in the coming three years.    According to a report provided by the Shanghai Uni-Trust  Property Trust and Consultancy Company Ltd, many investors both  at home and abroad have expressed desires to invest in the  construction of exhibition halls in Shanghai to show their  products and hold trade talks.    At present, the city has only four exhibition halls, with a  combined area of less than 40,000 sq m. They hardly meet the  needs of investors.    According to a plan, Shanghai will sponsor more than 60  large  international exhibitions and fairs in the near future.</p>

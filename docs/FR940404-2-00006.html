As a result of these findings, Jeffrey R.

Basic data developed during the environmental assessment are on file and may be reviewed by contacting Jeffrey R.

An environmental assessment was undertaken by the Soil Conservation Service (SCS) in conjunction with the development of the watershed plan. This assessment was conducted in consultation with local, State and other Federal agencies as well as with interested organizations and individuals. Data developed during the assessment are available for public review at the following location: Soil Conservation Service, Federal Building, 210 Walnut St., ste. 693, Des Moines, Iowa 50309&hyph;2180. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Recommended Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed is the installation of 880 acres of land treatment measure to be applied on farms for reduction of sheet, rill, and steambank erosion; storage and management of animal waste at 2 locations, 12 single purpose floodwater detention structures and one spring protection. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Effects of Recommended Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed plan will stabilize 800 acres of excessively eroding cropland, grassland and forestland, reduce flooding on a 160 acre floodplain, and protect one coldwater trout stream. Animal waste management facilities and application practices will prevent livestock wastes from two locations from entering the stream. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The recommended actions will protect the watershed hydrologically by improving the soil cover condition and reducing overland flow velocities. Streamflow will be stabilized to the extent that peak flood flow rates will be greatly reduced. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed actions will have no effect on wetlands. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An initial management summary of cultural resources as they relate to the planned components has been developed. The survey concludes that no significant adverse impacts will occur to cultural resources in the watershed should the plan be implemented. The SCS has consulted with the State Historic Preservation Office on the effects that planned measures will have on significant cultural resources. However, construction of manure storage units, floodwater detention structures and land treatment measures do have the potential for seriously disrupting individual sites. Therefore, caution shall be exercised in planning and installing such measures to avoid serious disruption of areas having potential as individual cultural sites. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

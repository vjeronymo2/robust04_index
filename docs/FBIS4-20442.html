The  complete glycoprotein D gene sequence has 1185 nucleotides and  encodes a polypeptide of 395 amino acids. Result obtained from  the homology comparison among 168, HFEM, SC16, 17 and Patton  showed that the most conserved region was located in the  ectodomain, whereas the most variable regions in the signal  peptide region, as well as transmembrane and cytoplasmic domain  regions. The present paper provides the basis for further  understanding of structure and function of HSV-1 gD gene and for  a HSV vaccine development.</p>

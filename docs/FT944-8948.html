			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / UK Company News: WMI hopes to buy Attwoods' UK side Waste Management Inter-national, the London-quoted arm of WMX of the US, yesterday confirmed it hoped to buy Attwoods' UK businesses if shareholders rejected the hostile Pounds 364m bid from Browning'Ferris Industries in favour of a break-up plan. WMI said it would be likely to offer more than Pounds 100m for the UK operations, based on publicly available information. Recently an independent surveyors' report published as part of Attwoods' defence revalued the UK business from Pounds 97m to Pounds 130.6m. WMI's interest comes as BFI is today expected to announce the terms of its final offer for the UK waste services group. Shareholders will have to balance what is widely expected to be a restructured offer from BFI with Attwoods' last ditch attempt to fend off the bid. Attwoods has promised to pay shareholders a cash sum upon the sale of the UK and European businesses. It then plans to seek a potential purchaser or merger partner for its US operations. These actions would deliver substantially more value than the current 109p per share offer from BFI, Attwoods argues. The break-up plan has been criticised by BFI for failing to produce the names of potential buyers or offers for the businesses. WMI said yesterday it could not provide a firm value for the UK operations until it had done due diligence. BFI said yesterday WMI's comments 'showed up the weaknesses of the break-up plan'. Mr Philip Angell of BFI said his company was offering 1.5 times revenue for the whole of Attwoods. WMI was suggesting, with an offer of Pounds 100m, a similar multiple for Attwoods best assets alone. 'It shows the bankruptcy of the break-up strategy,' he said, 'because the other assets will come in less than that.'</p>

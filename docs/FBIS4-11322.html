			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 25 Apr (PL) -- President Fidel Castro  welcomed the 225 participants in the "The Nation and the  Emigrants" conference, greeting them personally one by one.    The weekly TRABAJADORES magazine reports today that the  Cuban  leader thanked the emigres during the meeting last night for  their "solidarity and presence in the fatherland, for their  expressions of support for Cuba, for preserving the achievements  of the revolution, and for our people and their continuous,  tremendous struggle against the U.S. Government's blockade."    The weekly notes in a short article that Carlos Lage,  secretary of the executive committee and vice president of the  Council of State; Foreign Affairs Minister Roberto Robaina;  Ricardo Alarcon, president of the National Assembly of the  People's Government; Abel Prieto, president of the National  Union of Cuban Writers and Artists; and Jose Ramon Balaguer, all  of whom are members of the Politburo of the Communist Party of  Cuba, participated in the meeting with Fidel Castro.</p>

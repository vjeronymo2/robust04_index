			<p>BFN     [Text] Haikou, June 7 (CNS) -- The Hainan University, the  highest learning institution in Hainan Province, with the  approval of the provincial government, will abolish the  dual-enrolment system, namely, "studying at one's own expense"  and "studying at public expense" this year. All freshmen have  to pay for their education.    Fees for education in this university differ according to  what subject one majors in. Nine popular subjects including  architectural engineering and international finance have their  annual school fees set at RMB [renminbi] 2200 per student while  other subjects including agriculture, teacher training and  navigation are still free of charge and, instead, stipends for  the students majoring in these subjects are available.    In addition, a system of scholarship and loans for study has  been established in order to encourage students to devote  themselves to study and ensure poor students can finish their  course. Scholarships are sponsored by overseas Chinese and some  entrepreneurs.    The university will grant monthly living allowances of 60  yuan to all students, who also enjoy free medical care. Good  students who have financial difficulties will be entitled to  reductions or exemption of school fees. They can also apply for  a loan specially set for them. The interest-free loan will be  divided into three kinds with a respective annual amount of RMB  1000, RMB 800 and RMB 600.</p>

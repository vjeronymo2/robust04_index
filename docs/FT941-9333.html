			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / International Capital Markets: Volume in interest rate swaps advances 21% The volume of interest rate swaps written during the first half of 1993 reached 60,553 contracts, up 21 per cent from the previous six months, while contract volume in over-the-counter currency swaps dipped 8 per cent, to 4,897 contracts during the same period, according to a bi-annual survey of swaps activity conducted by Arthur Andersen and commissioned by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association. ISDA said the total notional principal amount of new swaps written during the first six months of 1993 reached Dollars 2,100bn, up 27 per cent from the last six months of 1992. Interest rate swaps accounted for Dollars 1,900bn of the total, and currency swaps Dollars 157bn. The value of capital risked in these transactions is typically 2 to 3 per cent of the notional principal value. The fastest-growing segment of the over-the-counter derivatives business, according to the survey, was interest rate swap options, or 'swaptions.' During the first half of 1993, about 40 per cent of interest rate and currency swaps were denominated in US dollars.</p>

			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / Quest for a strategy: A look at the debates in Nato over its future shape As President Bill Clinton returns to Washington this week after his seaside holiday, domestic and economic problems, such as the ambitious reform of the healthcare system or the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement, loom largest on his agenda for the autumn. But the clocks are running on a more international task, the transformation of the Atlantic alliance to meet a new set of needs and perils after the end of the Cold War. One clock is of Mr Clinton's own setting: the summit of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation scheduled for January 10, called at the US's request, demands an effort to spell out a new future for the alliance. Ticking more insistently, however, is the festering disaster that confronts Nato and the world community in Bosnia. If Bosnia is the model for the kind of regional and ethnic conflict that will replace the monolithic threat of the Warsaw Pact in Nato's strategic planning, it has posed uncomfortable questions that have received few good answers. 'It is a terrible model but it is the first one,' commented Mr Helmut Sonnenfeldt, a scholar at the Brookings Institution in Washington and formerly a senior foreign policy official in the Nixon and Ford administrations. Mr Sonnenfeldt is one of many observers who join General John Shalikashvili, the Supreme Allied Commander in Europe who has just been appointed to the chairmanship of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, in arguing that Nato has, at least on the technical and military level, done well in the face of the Bosnian crisis. 'On a military level the institution has performed very effectively. What has not happened are the political decisions that trigger action,' Mr Sonnenfeldt said, pointing to the plans drawn up, but never implemented, for the policing of the Vance-Owen peace plan as well as for air strikes against the Serbs. Colonel Don Snider, director of political-military affairs at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington research centre, sees a need for further changes to Nato's command structure and conventional forces, but agrees that the greatest challenge is in the political area. 'The political transformation of the alliance is not complete,' he said. In the search for a broader political vision of the future of Nato, clear leadership has yet to emerge from the governments of member countries, and especially from the US; for the moment, at least, the debate is taking place mostly among academics. One contribution to the debate, by Messrs Ronald Asmus, Richard Kugler and Stephen Larrabee of the Rand Corporation, a California-based think tank, is published today in the journal Foreign Affairs. The authors have worked closely with Senator Richard Lugar, the Indiana Republican who is one of the few members of Congress to have grappled with the issue, and who has trademarked the catchy phrase 'out of area or out of business' to summarise Nato's dilemma. They argue that Nato desperately needs to address the conflicts along its southern and eastern flanks if it is not to become irrelevant, and spell out six political steps they see as necessary 'to forge a new transatlantic bargain'. The first is 'to transform Nato from an alliance based on collective defence against a specific threat into an alliance committed to projecting democracy, stability and crisis management in a broader strategic sense'. Nato also needs a more harmonious balance between the US and Europe and a strong Germany fully participating in the alliance. Asmus, Kugler and Larrabee also urge a constructive security relationship with both Russia and the Ukraine, and a co-ordinated strategy for the integration of Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and possibly Slovakia as members of the alliance. The call for Nato to extend its membership to the east is now widely echoed in US academic circles, though hotly contested in the same issue of Foreign Affairs by Mr Owen Harries, formerly a senior Australian diplomat. Poland last week renewed its urgings to Nato to make a formal statement that it viewed the country as a future member after President Boris Yeltsin of Russia declared Polish membership would not be contrary to Russia's interests. But although the proposal is gaining ground in the US Congress, where Senator Lugar has warmly endorsed it, and also among some German politicians, in the US administration ideas about 'outreach' to eastern Europe stop well short of early Nato membership. Most European governments, meanwhile, are too preoccupied with ensuring the US does not leave the alliance to be much interested in new members. Academics and think-tank analysts in Washington complain bitterly that the Clinton administration is still a very long way from formulating anything like a comprehensive approach to Nato's future - although many are hopeful that General Shalikashvili has thought hard about the problem and may inject a new sense of urgency. 'Right now I don't think anybody in the administration can tell you what they are going to do at the Nato summit,' says Colonel Snider. So far, haphazard defence budget cuts in the US and Europe have done more to reforge Nato than any clear strategic conception. Because it was he who called for the meeting - and because his claim to leadership on the world stage remains sparse - Mr Clinton stands in particular need of turning next January's summit into a success. But if Nato continues to play the grand old Duke of York in Bosnia, marching its troops to the top of the hill and then marching them back down again, it seems likely to be seen to have failed its first big post-Cold War test - whatever the effectiveness of its military planning. If the Bosnian crisis continues to fester, Nato's perceived failure there could cloud the summit, and the alliance's future.</p>

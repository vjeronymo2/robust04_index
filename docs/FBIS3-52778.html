Leaders of the two rival factions of the rebel Sudan  People's  Liberation Army (SPLA) told the Archbishop of Canterbury, George  Carey, on Monday that they were committed to peace.    John Garang, leader of the mainstream SPLA faction, and Riek  Machar of the breakaway SPLA United group met the archbishop  after his controversial trip to famine-stricken rebel-held  southern Sudan prompted a major diplomatic row between Khartoum  and London.    But despite the rebels' assurances, western diplomats were  sceptical about the outcome of the talks, hosted by Kenyan  President Daniel arap Moi as chairman of a six-member regional  group, the Inter-Governmental Authority on Drought and  Development.    Sudanese Government and rebel delegates held inconclusive  talks in Nairobi last year after Nigerian-mediated negotiations  failed to bring peace to famine-ravaged southern Sudan, a vast  undeveloped region of savannah and swampland twice the size of  France.    After informal consultations on Wednesday and Thursday, the  talks were to open formally on Friday, the officials said.    The SPLA United faction wants a referendum on secession of  the south from the Arabic-speaking Islamic north, while Garang's  group would prefer to preserve Sudanese unity.    Relief officials here said government warplanes had made  several bombing raids on the south in the past two weeks amid  fears that Khartoum is poised to launch a major new offensive.</p>

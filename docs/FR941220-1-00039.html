EPA believes that Option 1 fully complies with SDWA's scheme for establishing drinking water regulations and is the best approach for regulating sulfate. However, there has been considerable discussion as to the necessity for federal regulatory action in protecting the public from the real, yet temporary laxative effect of sulfate. Various commentors on the 1990 proposal argued that sulfate should not be regulated at all because diarrhea does not present a significant risk to health, but rather is only an inconvenience. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency has a statutory requirement to regulate sulfate. In light of the above comments, EPA is seriously considering the following additional options for regulating sulfate. EPA solicits public comment and scientific evidence on all of the options being considered. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Option 2&blank;Under this option, the sulfate MCL and MCLG would be set at 500 mg/L. However, the target population would be limited to only infants, that is, only infants would need to be provided drinking water that meets the MCL for sulfate. The rationale for this option is that infants are the only population subgroup potentially subject to a significant risk to health, not due to the initial effect (diarrhea), but due to their inability to modify their environment or fluid intake, and the possibility that dehydration could occur if no action is taken. Under this Option, EPA would be taking the position that the laxative effect is more of an inconvenience than an adverse health effect in adults, and that no protection of adults is necessary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The implementation of Option 2 would require the same public notification/education activities outlined in Option 1, with modifications in the text to limit the target population to infants. The text would state that only infants are exposed to significant risk from sulfate ingestion. Just as in Option 1, CWSs in excess of the sulfate MCL would be required to provide notices in bills, signs, pamphlets and media notices to their customers in the service area. These CWSs would be required to deliver Alternative Water upon request to households with infants for a maximum of 20 weeks during their first year of life. Transient systems and non-transient, non-community systems would be required to post signs and assure a supply of bottled water for infants if there is any possibility of an infant being present at the facility. Since the target population is comprised only of infants, the allocation of bottled water would be 1 liter per day, rather than the 2 liters per day proposed under Option 1 for adults and infants. For costing purposes, the Agency assumes that under Option 2, no PWS would choose central treatment as a means of compliance. This assumption is based on the relatively small number of infants (less than 2% of a given population) and the option's relatively low administrative and logistical costs. The cost of arranging delivery of bottled water and providing public notification in the service area would be lower than the cost of installing central treatment. However, it is possible that a large PWS, in anticipation of future regulations for other contaminants, or to comply with other existing regulations for contaminants that can be removed by the same treatment technologies as sulfate (e.g., RO), might, in reality, choose central treatment. Such a system may find the permanent requirement to provide public notification and bottled water to the target population to be a long-term administrative burden that is ultimately less cost-effective than central treatment. A disadvantage to this option is the possible precedent that would be set by an EPA statement that diarrhea is not considered an adverse effect for adults. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Option 3&blank;Option 3 differs from Option 2 in the definition of the targetpopulation. The target population would be composed, as in Option 1, of infants and transient adults (including new residents), all of whom are subject to the adverse effect. However, unlike Option 1, there would be two different strategies under Option 3 to protect the two target population subgroups, infants and adults. As in Option 2, Alternative Water would have to be provided for infants. Unlike Option 2 however, PWSs would be required to notify transient adults of their risk, even though not required to provide them with Alternative Water. Public education/notification requirements would be identical to those described for Option 1 for both subgroups, except that the text of the notices would state that Alternative Water is only provided for infants upon request of the parent. Just as in Option 2, CWSs exceeding the sulfate MCL would be required to provide notices in bills, signs, pamphlets and media notices to their customers in the service area, and deliver bottled water upon request to households with infants for a maximum of 20 weeks. Similarly, transient and non-transient, non-community systems would be required to post signs and maintain a supply of bottled water. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The rationale for Option 3 is that it is necessary to set the MCL at a protective level, but sufficient for compliance purposes to provide notification/education to the affected adult population. This option is based on the theory that adequate protection for adults can be achieved through proper education and notification. Informed adults would be able to reduce or avoid the effect by taking the initiative to purchase bottled water or otherwise abstain from drinking tap water. Infants, on the other hand, depend on adults for their survival, and the minimization of diarrhea's effects depends on the adult's gradual mixing of the infant's tap water with water that complies with the sulfate MCL. Consequently, more stringent requirements (provision of Alternative Water) would be imposed to ensure protection of infants. The disadvantage of this option is that it requires members of the affected public to protect themselves after being notified of a potential risk. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

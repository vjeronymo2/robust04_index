			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Japan's downturn reaches the provinces: Charles Leadbeater visits a quiet town caught in the fallout of the deflating bubble THE coastal scrubland of Uchinada-machi does not look worth Y3.8bn (Pounds 20m). Yet that is what Daikyo, the property developer, paid for the sand hills overlooking the Japan Sea where it planned to build a dream resort with a 28-storey hotel, apartment block, amusement arcades and shopping malls. The project, which the local government approved in the teeth of fierce opposition from local environmentalists, was to have cost Y900bn. This autumn Daikyo announced that the dream conceived in the years of Japan's 'bubble' economy was being postponed for at least a year and a half. Most local people believe the sand dunes near the city of Kanazawa will remain no more than that. The resort plan was the most striking example of how Kanazawa became partly caught up in the bubble despite its deep-rooted conservatism. Now it is starting to feel the impact of the bubble's deflation and the economic downturn which has followed in its wake. The spread of the downturn to the provinces is likely to be one of the main themes of the Bank of Japan's influential quarterly report on the state of the Japanese economy which is published today. The report is likely to show that business confidence in the final quarter of the year reached lows not seen since the recession caused by the first oil shock almost a quarter of a century ago. Kanazawa was on the fringes of the bubble. Land prices there rose by 29 per cent in a year at their peak, compared with rises of more than 90 per cent in the large cities. The town's quiet streets saw a few Mercedes Benz cars with designer-clad drivers. Property developers arrived with plans for golf courses. Yet the bubble did not create the frenzy that it provoked in Tokyo. People in Kanazawa regard the speculation of that era as an infection, as much due to moral laxity as to ill-designed economic policies. Mr Hiroshuke Hashiba, managing director of the Daiwa department store, Kanazawa's largest, remarked: 'People got over confident. They thought because we had a huge trade surplus we could do anything. They thought that all this money gave them power, but actually it was just money going round and round.' At the prefectural government building in the centre of the city overlooking an avenue of trees, Mr Yaichi Nakanishi, who has been the governor of the Ishikawa prefecture for 30 years, said: 'There was too much money around and people believed that whatever they produced would be sold because the economy had always grown so fast they could sell whatever they made.' Many in Kanazawa believe the bubble's collapse should mark a moral turning point back towards the values of thrift, hard work and self-sacrifice which most older people regard as the cultural roots of Japan's economic success. Mr Ryozo Koshijima, the president of the local chamber of commerce, ex-plained: 'We stick to our own business in this area without buying stocks and shares or making a huge surplus for ourselves. The character-istics of this area are hardworking, stable, calm people.' However, in spite of this cultural inoculation against 'bubble values', Kanazawa has not been able entirely to escape the economic consequences of the bubble's deflation. Local industry, which is based on machinery making, is being hit by cuts in capital investment and exports. Domestic sales of Tsudakoma, the leading international textile machinery maker, are 20 per cent down in the past few months compared with the same period last year and exports fell by 15 per cent with slowing demand from Asia and Europe. According to Mr Shinsuke Taga, Tsudakoma's general manager, 'this downturn is probably worse than previous recessions because we are facing slower demand at home and abroad'. The local Hokkoku bank's conservatism has stood it in good stead. Its lending to property developers was limited. As a result it has one of the strongest capital bases among Japan's banks. Yet Mr Takeki Ataku, a senior executive, acknowledges that caution is making it increasingly reluctant to lend to companies in trouble. There were 43 bankruptcies in the area in the third quarter, more than double the number in the first three months of the year. The local labour market is still very tight, with 146 job offers for every 100 job applicants, compared with a ratio of 80 to 100 in Tokyo. Yet in spite of this the air of caution is spreading into the high street. Mr Hashiba at the Daiwa store which dominates the centre of the town, explained: 'People are becoming much more choosy, buying a shorter coat for winter because it is cheaper, ankle boots instead of knee-length boots. They are still spending but they are cutting back.' Daiwa's sales growth is slowing and retail sales in the region fell for the first time in September. Even the prefecture's tourist economy is being hit, with visits to the region's top six hot springs resorts down by 10 per cent. Kanazawa watched the rise and fall of the bubble economy as a financial spectacle in the big cities which little concerned it. Its strength rests upon its world class manufacturing companies such as Tsudakoma and Komatsu, the construction equipment manufacturers. In the wake of the bubble's deflation the gyrations of the stock market can still provoke a sense of crisis in Tokyo. In Kanazawa there is quiet caution as its economy shrinks with companies producing and investing less, consumers spending and banks lending less. Most business leaders are increasingly pessimistic. They do not expect growth to return till the end of next year. Mr Koshijima explained: 'The economy will probably not go down and down but it is probably going to stay very flat for a long time.'</p>

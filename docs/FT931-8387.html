			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Observer: Cheers Are you fat, addicted to rich food, averse to exercise, and perhaps even a smoker? If so, the medical journal Lancet has some useful advice for you . . . unless you happen to be French as wel1, and so probably know it already. First, never let your low-density lipoprotein become oxidised because, in that case, it will get busy helping to build up layers of fat that could block your arteries. Second, according to US and Israeli researchers, the perilous oxidisation can be forestalled by taking in phenolic flavonoids, which act as anti-oxidants. Third - which the researchers suspect the French, at least, somehow know instinctively - a pleasant way of absorbing phenolic flavonoids is to drink a modicum of red wine. The goodness is not in the alcohol, however, but in its other ingredients.</p>

			<p><P> September 19, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION;  </P> <P> WEAPONS PLANT WASTE ACCORD REACHED  </P> <P> Federal energy and environmental officials announced an agreement for handling  wastes from the federal Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant near Denver, an issue  that had threatened to close the plant. The problem arose because of concern by  officials from the Department of Energy and Rockwell International Corp., which  runs the plant for the department, about their personal liability for the  plant's failure to follow environmental laws by storing the mixed wastes at the  plant. Long-term storage of such wastes at a production site is not allowed,  yet there is no federally approved disposal site or treatment process for the  wastes. Under the agreement, which first came to light last week, DOE will  handle the wastes in compliance with hazardous waste storage requirements, and  will minimize the generation of such wastes.  </P></p>

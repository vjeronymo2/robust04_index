			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / TSB makes Pounds 597m bad debt charge TSB Group yesterday disclosed pre-tax profits of Pounds 43m for the year to October 31, compared with a Pounds 47m loss in 1991, after making a Pounds 597m charge to cover possible bad debts. The profit was less than brokers had expected. However, analysts' hopes were raised for other banks' full-year results by TSB's record operating profit of Pounds 648m, compared with Pounds 619m last year. TSB also confirmed it had established a loan administration unit to handle Pounds 1.8bn of doubtful loans made by Hill Samuel, TSB's merchant banking subsidiary, mainly in the late 1980s. It has Pounds 883m of provisions in its balance sheet to cover possible losses on these loans, and will try to run them down within four years. Sir Nicholas Goodison, TSB chairman, hinted at the possibility that Hill Samuel may be sold. He said the bank would not dispose of Hill Samuel unless it received an offer 'we could not resist'. He said the bank had received 'approaches but not offers'. Hill Samuel made a Pounds 54m profit after bad loans were put into the loan administration unit. Sir Nicholas said banks would continue to suffer from high bad debt provisions in the coming year, but there were 'grounds for cautious optimism' about an upturn which would help TSB in 1993. Operating profit improved after costs were reduced 2 per cent to Pounds 1.28bn, most of the fall coming from a 6 per cent cut in staff costs. TSB has since been hit by industrial action over redundancies. Mr Peter Ellwood, TSB chief executive, said the results were 'disappointing' and TSB wanted to achieve post-tax returns of 15 per cent on shareholders' funds within three years. To do this, it would have to cut costs further. The bank's interest spread - the gap between the average interest received on assets, and that paid on liabilities - remained at 3.6 per cent. The retail bank attracted Pounds 2.4bn of new retail funds by offering high interest accounts. The group maintained its dividend of 6.4p per share in spite of earnings of 0.6p per share. Its risk asset ratio - a measure of capital strength - fell to 11.7 per cent (12.2 per cent). The Tier 1 ratio fell to 7.6 per cent (8.5 per cent). Shares rose from 146.5p to 153p on the results announcement, and closed at 156p. Lex, Page 14; Details, Page 17</p>

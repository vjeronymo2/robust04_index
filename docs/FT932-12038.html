			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Dirty, mean and a touch larger than life in Texas ONLY one thing is reasonably certain about the special election tomorrow to fill the Senate seat from Texas vacated by Mr Lloyd Bentsen when he became treasury secretary: nobody will get the necessary 50 per cent and there will be a run-off between the top two, probably in early June. This will not stop much sonorous comment about how the election is the first state-wide referendum on the Clinton presidency, on its 101st day. But the validity of much of this may be questioned for the very simple reason that this is a Texas shoot-out in which, true to tradition, everybody, regardless of race, creed and party, is running against Washington and its president. The national implications will not be apparent until the predicted run-off, when it would be bad news for Clinton if the Bentsen seat went Republican. He has had trouble enough with 43 Senate Republicans and hardly needs more. But the Saturday race has been pure Texas politics - which means that it has been unscrupulous, dirty, mean and a touch larger than life. The frontrunner is Mr Bob Krueger, the former Democratic congressman and current interim Senator, appointed by Governor Anne Richards to fill Mr Bentsen's shoes after she had taken herself out of consideration. In Washington, but sensing the Texas wind, Mr Krueger has frequently voted reflexively against his president. Running second to fourth in most local polls are three Republicans, Ms Kay Bailey Hutchison, the state treasurer, and two congressmen, Mr Jack Fields and Mr Joe Barton. Ms Hutchison, a moderate unpopular with the local pro-life movement because of her tolerance for abortion, was considered the strongest candidate until former Governor John Connally, who is advising Mr Fields, spread the nasty little story that she had slapped around his own daughter, then an employee of Ms Hutchison. This is par for the Texas political course (Lyndon Johnson routinely spread dirty rumours). But Ms Hutchison is also on the receiving end of some rude out-of-state comment. The National Review, Mr William F Buckley's conservative magazine, dismissed her as 'George Bush in drag' and urged its readers to support Mr Fields. Still, Senator Phil Gramm, the other Senator and a Republican, is in her corner. Mr Barton is a ferocious conservative, highly regarded by the National Rifle Association, Mr Fields a little less so and more of the populist. It is an open question to what extent, in the event of a run-off, the two Republican losers could back the winner. Also on the ballot is Mr Richard Fisher, nominally a Democrat but in reality a Perotista. He advised, to the extent anybody did, Texas billionaire Mr Ross Perot in his presidential run last year and is blatantly mimicking that campaign, including spending an estimated Dollars 4m of his own money to finance it. However, all local polls show him running fifth. Mr Krueger is expected to finish first on Saturday mostly because of the Republican split. But local surveys also show him quite vulnerable in a run-off. This contest would feature some seriously dirty pool.</p>

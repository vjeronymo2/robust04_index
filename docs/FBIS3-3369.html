Committee members from the Revolutionary Committee of the  Chinese Kuomintang, the China Democratic League, the China  Association for Promoting Democracy, the Chinese Peasants and  Workers Democratic Party, the China Zhi Gong Dang [Party for  Public Interests], the Jiusan [September 3] Society, and the  Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League submitted a total of 13  proposals under the name of their respective parties and  organizations.    In accordance with relevant provisions in the "Regulations  of  the CPPCC National Committee for Work Related to Proposals" and  the work plan for this session, the Motions Committee divided  itself into several groups to earnestly examine the proposals  and then placed 1,851 proposals, or 97.8 percent of the total,  on file for further action. Among them were 726 proposals, or  39.2 percent, on economic construction; 556 proposals, or 30  percent, on science, education, culture, public health, and  sports; 373 proposals, or 20.2 percent, on political, legal, as  well as labor and personnel affairs; and 196 proposals, or 10.6  percent, on united front work as well as matters related to  nationalities, religions, and Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan  compatriots and overseas Chinese. A total of 42 proposals  falling short of the requirements for further action were  instead handled as letters from committee members, after the  consent of the committee members concerned was obtained through  consultations.    Acting in accordance with the current session's guidelines  of "promoting democracy, seeking truth from facts, achieving  unity, and going all out" and focusing on the overall tasks of  seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider,  promoting development, and preserving stability, committee  members presented many positive views and suggestions on major  issues vital to the country's lasting peace and prosperity and  on flash-point issues of concern to the masses of people, such  as how to improve macroeconomic regulation and control,  strengthen infrastructure construction, strengthen the role of  agriculture as the foundation of the national economy,  invigorate state-owned large and medium enterprises, support  economic development in ethnic minority regions, strengthen  environmental protection; maintain the sustained, rapid, and  healthy development of the economy; accelerate the establishment  of a socialist market economic structure, stabilize commodity  prices, perfect the tax system, improve the market mechanism,  develop science and technology, revitalize education, promote  cultural prosperity, push the reform of medical and public  health structures, strengthen the building of socialist  spiritual civilization, perfect the legal system, combat  corruption and promote clean government, improve public order,  ensure Hong Kong's smooth transition, and promote the  motherland's peaceful reunification. Many proposals,  particularly those presented by various parties and groups, were  developed on the basis of careful investigation and study.  Their arguments are well grounded, and they not only point out  problems but also provide methods and approaches for solving the  problems.    After studying the proposals on record, the Motions  Committee  decided to forward them separately to 145 units for handling.  They include relevant departments of the CPC Central Committee;  relevant ministries, commissions, and departments under the  State Council; the National People's Congress [NPC] Standing  Committee's General Office, the Central Military Commission's  General Office, the Supreme People's Court, the Supreme People's  Procuratorate, relevant people's organizations; and party  committees and people's governments of the relevant provinces,  autonomous regions, and municipalities. While the CPPCC  National Committee was still in session, the Motions Committee,  based on proposals by some CPPCC National Committee members,  requested leading comrades of the State Education Commission to  visit the members' districts to brief the localities on the  implementation of the "Teachers Law" and to exchange views on  it. The Motions Committee also promptly consulted relevant  units on 10 urgent proposals and had these handled while the  National Committee was still in session.    After the end of the Second Session of the Eighth CPPCC  National Committee, the National Committee's General Office is  to hold a meeting of the responsible persons of the general  offices of the various units undertaking to handle the proposals  to discuss matters related to their implementation.</p>

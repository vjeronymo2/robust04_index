The Peruvian president, who was in Chile to attend the  inauguration of President Eduardo Frei, said: "What we need is  a bit more dialogue and communication and to cast away  ultraconservatism and the arms race that have caused so much  damage."    Fujimori said Peru has taken concrete steps to create a  climate of confidence and has withdrawn "entire battalions" from  the Chilean border.    He added: "I do not think border problems will prevent  development between the two countries," and reiterated his  government's will to negotiate an economic cooperation agreement  with Chile.    During the interview Fujimori said: "I believe in the future  of the integration process," and that in this sense concrete  steps must be taken. "This would be a good step to be taken,  and we are willing to do so now that there is a rapprochement  with Chile at all levels."    According to Fujimori, the two countries can successfully  complement each other in the agro-industrial and metallurgical  fields.    During his stay in Santiago, Fujimori and Frei agreed to  work  on an economic cooperation agreement that will provide for  actions in the investments field, and include custom tariff  lists and telecommunications and transportation agreements.    Fujimori also disclosed that his country is interested and  getting ready to join the Free Trade Agreement (TLC) with the  United States.    In his opinion, "our economy now is quite open compared to  that of other Latin American countries because we have made a  lot progress... We believe that we soon will be fully  competitive to join the major blocs."    Fujimori said his government's goals for this year are to  reduce inflation to 25 percent and reach economic growth of more  than 5 percent. The Peruvian president did not dismiss the  possibility of running for reelection but asserted that he will  make a decision in this regard next October.</p>

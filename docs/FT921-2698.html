			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Labour takes 5-point lead in two polls THE LABOUR party last night claimed to have seized the initiative in the opening general election battle over the economy and taxation after two opinion polls gave it a five-point lead over the Conservatives. Published on the eve of the launch of their election manifestos, the polls contrasted with earlier surveys suggesting that the two main parties remained neck-and-neck. As Mr John Major prepared to restore the momentum of his campaign with the launch of a manifesto setting out a distinctive Conservative agenda for the 1990s, senior ministers sought to brush aside the findings. The ministers, who said that a shake-up in the Whitehall machine would be among a series of new ideas in the Conservative manifesto, pointed to sharp day-to-day fluctuations in the dozen or more surveys published since the election was announced last week. But after another day in which the economy and taxation dominated the campaign, Mr Neil Kinnock claimed that the publication this week of Labour's tax and benefit plans had given him a decisive advantage. His optimism was reinforced by the first opinion poll taken after the announcement of Mr John Smith's shadow Budget. The ICM poll for The Guardian carried out yesterday put Labour on 43 per cent and the Conservatives on 38 per cent, with the Liberal Democrats on 16 per cent. The same levels of support are shown in a Mori poll for The Times carried out before the unveiling of Labour's tax package. These latest snapshots of opinion will boost Labour morale in the first crucial phase of the campaign. They came after the financial markets had closed in London, but in New York sterling remained firm against a weaker dollar. In his first full day of campaigning around the country, Mr Major repeatedly attacked Labour for its 'vindictive' plans to increase sharply the tax burden on those earning more than Pounds 22,000. Mr Kinnock seized on official figures showing another fall in manufacturing output to accuse the government of 'appalling' economic mismanagement. Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, joined the row with a warning that the recession risked turning into a 'slump', but Mr Major said the re-election of a Tory government would quickly trigger a recovery. The ministers said today's Conservative manifesto would translate the change in the party's rhetoric and style since Mr Major replaced Mrs Margaret Thatcher into a new 'agenda' for the next five years. Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, signalled that among measures to emphasise a 'caring' image would be a drive to regenerate the inner cities and a range of new training initiatives. He promised rents-into-mortgages schemes for council tenants to spread the benefits of ownership. Alongside the plans to overhaul Whitehall - always resisted by Mrs Thatcher  -Mr Major plans to give a commitment to a more open style of government. The changes in the government machine involve creating a cabinet post to oversee the implementation of the Citizen's Charter. The charter, launched last year, will be at the centre of the government's programme to provide better public services. The reforms also involve a move to strengthen the Department of Trade and Industry, which would take over most of the responsibilities of the Energy Department. There was speculation last night that a second cabinet post would be created to oversee a strengthened department covering the arts, heritage and sports. Labour's manifesto will have at its core a recovery package for industry and jobs alongside a range of initiatives on education, health and crime. The 10,000-word document, entitled 'Its Time To Get Britain Working Again', combines the twin themes of the need for change and Labour's recent poster campaign: 'Majorism Isn't Working' - itself lifted from the Tories' successful 1979 attack on Labour.

			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / International Company News: Strong sales lift Astra 23% in first half Astra, the Swedish pharmaceuticals group, yesterday announced a 23 per cent jump in first-half profits to SKr4.50bn (Dollars 581m), with strong sales growth more than compensating for a sharp drop in financial income. The group said sales and earnings would continue to rise in the second half, although it warned that growth would be slower than last year because of a less favourable currency influence. Underlying sales were 23 per cent higher at SKr13.3bn, enabling the group to take further market share in its most important markets. Star performer was the anti-ulcer drug, Losec, which lifted sales by 41 per cent, compared with market growth of around 10 per cent. Overall, Losec sales reached SKr8.14bn, up 47 per cent. Losec, the main challenger to Glaxo's Zantac, has around 35 per cent of the European market and is the top-selling drug in both France and Germany. Astra says it has preliminary indications that Losec may even have overtaken Zantac in the UK market. The drug has a US market share of around 17 per cent. Pulmicort, the anti-asthma agent, increased sales by 29 per cent to SKr1.77bn, helped by the launch of the group's Pulmicort Turbuhaler in Germany this year. Group operating earnings grew 37 per cent to SKr4.42bn but the full impact was not felt at the bottom line because of a sharp drop in financial income to SKr85m from SKr392m. The group said it suffered up to SKr150m in unrealised losses on its bond portfolio while capital expenditure rose sharply to SKr3.3bn from SKr1.2bn. Among other investments, the group strengthened its position in Japan by lifting its stake in a joint venture with Fujisawa to 90 per cent. Sales in Germany, the group's main market, climbed 27 per cent in local currencies, against estimated market growth of 5 per cent. The company said Losec's German sales had not been affected by a domestic scare surrounding an injectable form of the drug. Analysts expect full-year profits of between SKr9.5bn and SKr10bn, compared with SKr7.8bn last year.</p>

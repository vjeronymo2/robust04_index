			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Smith bids to improve EC profile MR JOHN SMITH, Labour leader, tried to restore his European credentials yesterday as he launched a fresh attack on the Liberal Democrats for voting with the government in this week's debate on the Maastricht treaty. Mr Smith used his speech to a Labour conference on Europe in Brighton to insist that Britain had to be in the lead in Europe, saying: 'Let us play our part in shaping the Europe of the next century.' He justified Labour's decision to vote against the government by saying he was not prepared to support a motion, 'which would have endorsed the Conservative opt-out from a social chapter which the rest of the (European) Community properly regards as vital'. He said Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, was either 'not telling the truth' or was 'an unashamed hypocrite' in suggesting that he knew three weeks ago that the government would delay completing ratification of the Maastricht Bill until after the second Danish referendum. Mr Smith said Mr Ashdown had told the Commons he did not believe that Britain should, 'shelter behind the skirts of the Danish people'. The Liberal Democrats had backed, 'a discredited and bankrupt government that is undermining our society, destroying our economy and wrecking our future in Europe'. His comments came at the end of a week in which relations between Labour and the Liberal Democrats have worsened dramatically. Aides to Mr Ashdown denied there had been any contact between the Liberal Democrats and the government, but confirmed that the party had long believed the bill's committee stage could last until April or May. Conservatives have attacked Labour. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, in a speech in Derbyshire last night, said that 'domestic partisan interests - and an appalling lack of principle - have, once again, been allowed to overshadow Britain's future in Europe'. Mr Smith accused Mr John Major of failing to provide leadership, saying the prime minister should have used Britain's EC presidency to initiate Europe-wide action to counter recession.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 11 KYODO -- Vietnam desires more  Japanese investment and is ready to take further steps to  attract it, a senior representative of a Vietnamese business  association said Wednesday [11 May].    Doan Ngoc Bong, first vice president of the Chamber of  Commerce and Industry of Vietnam, made the remarks to some 200  Japanese business people at a seminar on investment in Vietnam  held at the Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren).  He said that as of mid-March, there were 897 licensed foreign  investment projects, with a combined capital value of 8.47  billion dollars.    With 56 investment projects capitalized at 542 million  dollars, Japan trailed in fifth place behind Taiwan, Hong Kong,  Singapore and Australia -- despite its being Vietnam's largest  trading partner and aid donor.    Among the Japanese investments are 26 industrial projects,  five oil and gas projects, five bottling or canning projects,  four agriculture or forestry projects, three service sector  projects, one fisheries project and one housing construction  project.    At a bilateral economic conference held in Ho Chi Minh City  last month, Japanese investors were invited to put money into  industrial and export-processing zones as well as such priority  areas as oil and gas, cement, food processing and manufacturing  for export.    Doan Ngoc Bong said Vietnam also welcomes more investment in  the form of build-operate-transfer (BOT) projects, which Hanoi  will treat as a special priority. He noted that the speed of  Vietnam's absorption of foreign investment funds has been rapid,  rising at an average 52 percent annually.    Vietnam received 70 percent as much investment in 1992 as it  attracted during the previous four years, while the total  investment in 1993 was 40 percent more than that in 1992, he  said. But he acknowledged that Vietnam has much to accomplish  if it is to continue attracting foreign investment in the face  of increasing competition from other countries in the region.    Among impediments that have been cited by potential  investors  are the country's weak infrastructure, shortcomings in the  legal, financial and accounting systems, and poor local working  conditions.</p>

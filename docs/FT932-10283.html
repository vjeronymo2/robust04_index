			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / Huge popularity predicted for lottery THE NATIONAL Lottery planned for the UK could be played every week by most of the population, with more people watching the live draw every Saturday night than watch Coronation Street, Raymond Snoddy writes. A report published today by the GAH consultancy group predicts a significant impact for the lottery, to be launched next year in aid of 'good causes'. The report says that in many states and provinces of the US and Canada the lottery has become the largest contributor to government revenues. In some countries, such as Norway, the national lottery is the largest business, it says. The UK national lottery could become the largest lottery in Europe, ahead of France and Spain, and could generate sales of between Pounds 2.5bn and Pounds 6bn. The report says: 'We believe Pounds 4bn to Pounds 4.5bn is an achievable target.' It says success will depend on the percentage of sales allocated to the licence holder for operating costs, the number of retail agents needed to achieve national coverage and the running of instant games. The National Lottery, GAH Consultants, 4-6 Arne Street, London, WC2E 9NE. Pounds 695.</p>

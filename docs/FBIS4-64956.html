			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara-Sanliurfa, May 6 (A.A) -- Murat Karayalcin,  Social Democratic Populist Party leader and deputy prime  minister, said today that cooperation among left-wing parties  for an election had a high chance of realization.    He was speaking to journalists on board a plane on his way  to  the southeastern city of Sanliurfa.    On the cancellation of three mayoral elections in Istanbul,  of which two were won by the pro-Islamic Prosperity Party,  Karayalcin said that this decision of the High Election Board  created an opportunity.    He recalled that the board has thus far canceled results of  15 mayoral elections.    `We shall spend efforts, by heeding the calls for the  unification of social democrats, toward realizing cooperation in  the left,' he said.</p>

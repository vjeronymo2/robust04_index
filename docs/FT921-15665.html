			<p>920109 FT  09 JAN 92 / Bush in Japan: US auto makers await concessions THE US president, who has made opening Japanese markets to foreign goods the main purpose of his trip to Japan, yesterday secured some modest trade concessions from the Japanese government. But Mr George Bush failed to obtain the assurances he has sought on better access to Japanese markets for the US auto industry. The president, who is concerned about the US recession and Japan's large bilateral trade surplus, regards resolving auto trade issues as crucial to the success of his visit. While he and Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, steered clear of trade details at their summit meeting yesterday, their officials were locked in long negotiations. The talks were planned to end by the evening. But officials were forced to postpone scheduled briefings when it became apparent that the two sides were still divided over the auto market. They hope to reach agreement today. 'It's pretty tough. But I think we could have smiles on our faces in the end,' said one official close to the talks. The Japanese have agreed to US demands in some areas, including the relaxation of testing procedures for imported cars. However, US officials are not satisfied with the pledges they have secured for increases in purchases of foreign parts - including imports and local procurement for overseas plants - and imports of US-made cars. This week, leading Japanese car companies announced revised plans to increase purchases of foreign-made parts. Under great pressure from the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti) the manufacturers increased targets announced only two months ago. Toyota, the biggest maker, pledged to buy Dollars 5.2bn (Pounds 2.85bn) worth of foreign components in 1994, compared with an original target of Dollars 4.6bn and an actual figure of Dollars 2.6bn in 1990. Nissan Motor, the second largest company, promised purchases of Dollars 3.7bn, compared with a previous goal of Dollars 3.3bn and a 1990 total of Dollars 1.3bn. Toyota, Nissan, Honda Motor, Mazda Motor and Mitsubishi Motors, the five biggest manufacturers, together agreed to buy parts worth Dollars 17.8bn, compared with a previous goal of Dollars 16bn. The increased figure still falls short of a total of about Dollars 20bn demanded by the US. The gap is even greater in imports of finished cars. US makers have complained that they cannot sell many cars in Japan because the sales networks are controlled by the large Japanese manufacturers. So Miti has pressed Japanese makers to open their networks to imports. Yesterday, leading Japanese makers announced plans to import between 45,000 and 50,000 more US-made cars a year into Japan by 1994. The bulk, however, will come from an increase in imports of US-made Honda cars - from 14,000 in 1991 to 27,000 - and a plan by Toyota to import 20,000 of its US-made vehicles by 1994. Help for US makers will be on a smaller scale - Toyota said it would negotiate with General Motors about selling perhaps 5,000 cars a year. Nissan plans to sell 3,000 Ford vehicles annually and Honda intends to increase the number of Chrysler jeeps it handles from 437 to 1,200. Mr Peter Pestillo, vice-president of Ford, said in Tokyo that the figures were too small to solve the imbalance in the auto trade. Mr Bush told Mr Miyazawa that while he wanted better access for US manufacturers, Americans also had to consider why European cars sold well in the Japanese market and US cars did not. Meanwhile, the president got some satisfaction on a project close to his heart - his request for a Japanese contribution to a Dollars 8.25bn superconducting supercollider, a huge scientific research machine, under construction in his home state of Texas. Mr Miyazawa agreed to the setting up of a working group to study the project.</p>

			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Recs alert Shares in the regional electricity companies fell sharply during early trading as Hoare Govett, the stockbroker, highlighted the possibility of a one-off tax on the National Grid disposal, but they subsequently rallied strongly after London Electricity bought in seven per cent of its shares. Helping fuel the bullish run by the stocks in the afternoon was news that Eastern Electricity had called an analysts meeting for Monday afternoon. The move was seen by dealers as indicating a possible share buy-back on Monday morning, a potential series of big cost cutting measures or even a takeover move against one of the other recs. Eastern is the only Rec to have received shareholder permission to buy in up to 14.9 per cent of its shares, in this case, some 38m shares. Eastern shares jumped 19 to 761p as the news filtered into the market. London's broker, SG Warburg Securities bought the 15.3m London shares at 672p a share, in a move similar to that carried out for Northern Electricity and Midlands Electricity recently. London shares closed 2 off at 683p with turnover expanding rapidly to 33m following the share purchases by Warburg. Newspaper group Telegraph jumped sharply after parent group Hollinger said it intended to increase its shareholding. The Canadian media group said it was confident of the prospects of the Telegraph and intended to buy up to 6.8m shares, taking its stake to 62 per cent from 57 per cent. The news offset a warning from the Telegraph that operating profits in the third quarter would be hit by the newspaper price wars. The shares leapt 45 before closing 20 better at 330p. Hard on the heels of Thursday's James Capel downgrade story Barclays Bank shares fell further, losing 8 more to 542p, after 539p, on stories that UBS is preparing a sell note on the stock and also on rumours circulating in the market that the bank has suffered from substantial losses in proprietary trading. Bank of Scotland managed a minor gain at 194p after Smith New Court executed a bought deal involving 4m shares bought for 187p each and placed at 188p. Vague rights issue talk also resurfaced at T&amp;N, leaving the shares 2 1/2 lower 209 1/2 p as the market speculated on the outcome of the company's plan for an enhanced scrip issue dividend. Terms for the scrip are due to be announced towards the end of this month with the Dollars 47m savings to T&amp;N underpinning its purchase of control of a controlling stake in German motor components group Kolbenschmidt. Lucas Industries lost ground ahead of Monday's full-year results, retreating 5 to 177p as rights issue rumours swirled around the shares which stood at 196p a week ago. Turnover was relatively light at 3m trades and the consensus among analysts was that although sizeable restructuring provisions could well emerge on Monday, talk of an imminent financing move by the company was misplaced. P&amp;0 stood out among lacklustre transport shares, falling 6 to 596p in negligible trading volume. The shares have underperformed the market by 3 per cent over the past month and one top securities is known to be teeing up a buy recommendation. Eurotunnel shed a further 5 to 248p as traders digested the implications of a substantial stock overhang in the shape of the 29m shares held by Bombardier of Canada. News that food retailer Argyll Group was to sell 101 Lo-Cost discount stores helped the shares shrug off worries over the pricing war currently being fought out by competitors in the sector. The shares retreated to a low of 259p, before recovering on news of the deal and the improved market trend to close unchanged at 265p, in volume of 2.2m. Nervous trading in Body Shop ahead of next week's interim figures left the shares trailing 5 at 209p. It was also caution ahead of figures later this month in Highland Distilleries that left the shares 7 weaker at 424p. Cadbury Schweppes closed 6 lower at 442p on talk that it was planning a launch a bid for US group Dr Pepper/Seven Up in which it has a 26 per cent stake. In the new issue market, ED &amp; F Man traded at a substantial discount to the issue price of 180p, closing at 172p. A profits downgrading by Smith New Court in Leigh Interests, the environmental services group, saw the shares fall 7 to 195p. Biotech company Celltech was firm at 207p as Lehman Brothers recommended the stock ahead of a presentation on October 25. London International, the condom manufacturer, eased 3 to 84p ahead of suspected downgrades next week.</p>

			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Direct Line to create 400 jobs DIRECT LINE, the telephone-based motor insurance subsidiary of Royal Bank of Scotland, yesterday announced it was to open its fifth regional operations centre in December, creating 400 jobs in Leeds. The company, which also offers household insurance, has been growing rapidly since its launch in 1985. It has nearly doubled the number of its motor-insurance customers to 1.25m during the past year. It employs 1,900 people in Croydon, Surrey, Glasgow, Manchester and Birmingham. Mr Peter Wood, chief executive, said that the growth in customers in the north meant that it now needed more than one regional office there.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] On 6 April, Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina  addressed the committee of representatives of the Latin American  Integration Association [ALADI] headquartered in Montevideo.  Robaina's address to the plenum committee affirmed that with the  previous broad process of Latin American integration, it is  possible to achieve integration of hemispheric magnitude,  averting the danger of neocolonialism. He added:    [Begin Robaina recording] Let us work to join the  subregional  processes toward a Latin American dimension. Let us attain a  regional consensus on social, economic, and political issues  aimed at Latin America's integration and our fair insertion in  terms of economic and international relations. Let us seek to go  further by progressively integrating production and service  sectors. Scientific and technological cooperation would also be  an instrument vital to the integration process. [end recording]    Referring to Cuba's reality, Robaina told the ALADI  committee  that Cuba's economic problems will not be solved with foreign  investments only, but that the main solutions are Cuba's  programs for development and efforts to increase production and  exports. Robaina asserted that today, everything in Cuba is open  to discussion at every level, except Cuba's sovereignty,  self-determination, and particularly, the accomplishments of its  social project.    Robaina closed his address to the ALADI committee by  requesting the confidence of our Latin American brothers  because, and I quote: We have already done what is possible; we  are now doing the impossible; for miracles, we ask only for a  bit more time.</p>

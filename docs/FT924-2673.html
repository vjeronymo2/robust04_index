			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Toshiba strikes oil in recycled plastic Researchers at Toshiba's environmental engineering laboratory have developed a way of reclaiming fuel oil from chloride-based plastics, such as PVC and polypropylene. The difficulty in recycling these chloride-based plastics is that they give off harmful hydrogen chloride gas when heated. The Toshiba process puts smashed plastics into a reacting chamber, as with traditional reclamation processes. However, a high-density alkaline solution is then added which transforms hydrogen chloride into a harmless salt when heated. Because the alkaline solution decomposes some of the plastic additives that resist heat, the retrieval rate for oils rises from 50 per cent to 90 per cent. Toshiba: Japan, 03 3457 4511.</p>

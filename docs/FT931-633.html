			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / Troubled Scots pit restarts production MONKTONHALL, the Edinburgh colliery leased from British Coal by a miners' consortium, was due to resume production last night after losing two days' output after the death of a miner on Saturday. The accident at the coalface was a further setback to the pit which is in serious financial difficulties. On Friday the 160 miners received their first week's pay for after working without pay for eight weeks. The miner, Mr William Gorman, 35, was killed when part of the roof collapsed at the colliery's only coalface. He had joined the Monktonhall Mineworkers consortium nine weeks ago by subscribing Pounds 10,000 to buy his stake in the company. An inspector from the mines inspectorate of the government's Health and Safety Executive is investigating the accident, the first since the mine was reopened last summer. The consortium has debts of more than Pounds 1.6m and Bank of Scotland has refused to advance more cash. At the end of last month the consortium appealed for a partner to inject new capital to keep going but later turned down an offer from Caledonian Mining, an English company which wanted to take a controlling stake. Although Monktonhall has orders from British Coal and ScottishPower, it incurred debts because of a three-month delay in resuming production at the pit at the end of 1992.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Latvian Press Review"] </F>   [Text] Riga, April 6 (LETA) -- The Russian-language daily  "SM- SEGODNJA" published the survey of a poll. Among 918  responders asked whether the Saeima [parliament] should ratify  the troop withdrawal agreement with Russia or not, 38.8 percent  found it a necessity, 22.3 percent said it is possible, 13.5  percent are against it and 25.4 percent of responders failed to  answer. The comments upon the poll said the results promise  vague hopes for the opponents of the agreement. Besides the  support of ratification of the agreements among the native  population is higher than that of the Russian-speakers.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, 25 Jan (XINHUA) -- A spokesman of the Hong  Kong and Macao Affairs Office under the State Council issued a  statement on the new airport issue in Hong Kong here today.  Full text follows:    The Hong Kong British authorities, regardless of the  opposition by the Chinese side, allowed the Hong Kong-British  Legislative Council (Legco) to pass a bill last week for  allocating 1.67 billion Hong Kong dollars for the new airport  project before any agreement has reached between China and  Britain on the financial arrangement for the new airport and  went on to decide to apply with the Legco for another  appropriation of 4.6 billion Hong Kong dollars.    According to the present financial arrangement for the  airport project by the British side, the debt to be left over to  the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region after 1997 will run  up to well over 45 billion Hong Kong dollars, which will be nine  times the total debt limit set in the memorandum of  understanding signed by the heads of government of China and  Britain.    By continuing to apply for fund allocation when the whole  financial arrangement by the British side have already violated  the memorandum of understanding, the Hong Kong authorities are  in fact creating further obstacles to the talks on the Hong Kong  new airport project.    The Chinese side hereby declares:    Before any agreement on the financial arrangement for the  new  airport project has been reached by the two sides:    1. The Chinese side and the government of the future Hong  Kong Special Administrative Region will not be liable for any  expenditure and debt incurred by building the new airport;    2. The land to be used and the prices of the land, including  the land to be occupied by the new airport and the land to be  used along the railway line leading to the airport, must be  leased through the discussion of the Sino-British Land Committee  according to the provisions of Annex 3 of the Sino-British joint  declaration;    3. All the contracts associated with the new airport project  that cover the time beyond June 30, 1997 approved by the Hong  Kong British authorities without the consent of the Chinese side  will be invalid after July 1, 1997;    4. Any law or ordinance associated with the new airport  project adopted by the Hong Kong British Legislative Council  will become invalid after July 1, 1997;    The Chinese Government has always supported the construction  of a new airport in Hong Kong. In order to separate political  issues from economic ones, it has approved the project of making  land from the sea at Wanchai, central, and the project of  sea-bed tunnel at the western harbor. The Chinese side regrets  for the British side's repeated breach of the agreement reached  between the two governments. But the Chinese side still hope  that the British side would earnestly deliberate the positive  proposals raised by the Chinese side on reducing costs and debts  and strengthening management and supervision and produce a  financial arrangement which tallies with the spirit of the  memorandum of understanding so as to facilitate the restoration  of the talks on the new airport issue.</p>

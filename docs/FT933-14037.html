			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Builders squeezed on both sides: Construction groups which bid low for tenders now face higher material costs THE CHAIRMAN of a publicly quoted British construction group with a turnover of several hundred million pounds has this week explained why his company is prepared to take contracts for no profit or even at a loss. The aim, he says, is to uncover projects with ill-defined designs which could require changes to plans and specification before work is completed. The company bidding for such a contract could put in an exceedingly low tender to win the job, confident that it would be able to charge extra and make a profit from the variations. The practice is not uncommon in the construction industry, but has become more widespread, says the contractor, as hard-pressed businesses have sought to boost declining order books and generate cash from contract progress payments to reduce large property borrowings. The practice has not prevented many contractors and sub-contractors from going out of business - indeed tender prices have tumbled to their lowest level since 1986. Contractors are now facing a double squeeze. Building material prices, which fell steeply during the early 1990s, have recently begun to rise again. And construction companies which have won long-term contracts at fixed prices will have to meet the extra costs out of contract prices which already assume little or no margin for profit. The building cost information service of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors revealed this week that contractors' tender prices, which have fallen by a quarter since 1989 and are at their lowest level since 1986, have declined by a further 3 per cent in the first three months of this year. It says cut-throat competition among builders is forcing prices down to suicidal levels. 'Work levels will not allow tender prices to rise until late 1994 and, with pressure on supply and sub-contract costs, it is difficult to see how some companies will cope,' the institution warns. Even contracts which have arrangements to compensate builders for higher material prices may not provide an adequate safety net, says EC Harris, international construction cost consultants. This is because most agreements are based on suppliers' list prices and take no account of discounts and special deals which may be offered to contractors, depending on their purchasing power and payment record. Client payments might take account of increases in list prices but do not compensate for loss of discounts which may have been eroded as material producers seek to regain lost margins, according to EC Harris. A study by the consultants of 'real' price increases by material producers, including reduction in discounts, reveals immense differences in prices offered to contractors. As a basis for the study the consultants considered the construction of a modest 20,000 sq ft office block in central London costing about Pounds 2m. Results show that material prices for an equivalent development would have risen on average by 5.2 per cent in the past 12 months. This increase, however, disguises the diversity of prices offered to contractors for the same building material. Prices for 32mm steel reinforcement, according to the EC Harris sample, have varied recently from Pounds 295 a tonne to Pounds 460 a tonne, the difference between a standstill in price since June last year and a 38 per cent increase. The average increase in reinforcement over the same period has been 24 per cent. Increases in 12.7mm plasterboard, after discounts, have ranged between 7.1 per cent and 26.2 per cent - a difference in price of Pounds 1.15 per sq m and Pounds 1.75 per sq m. The average price increase for plasterboard has been 13.7 per cent. Average ready-mix concrete prices for a central London development (prices vary regionally as well as from customer to customer) have risen by 5.8 per cent since June last year say the consultants; structural steelwork prices have risen by 10.5 per cent; clay bricks 7 per cent; concrete blocks 6.1 per cent and copper pipe 10 per cent. By comparison, prices of aluminium curtain walling, a common cladding around office buildings, and air conditioning prices have remained unchanged from the low level of 12 months ago. The reasons why building material producers are able to raise prices while contractors are implementing reductions reflects the great difference between two sectors. Contracting is a low capital intensive business relying on the skills of its people rather than its assets. It remains a highly fragmented, competitive industry. But the capital investment to produce building material is far higher - a new cement works can cost more than Pounds 100m. The number of competing players in production also tends to be smaller, making it easier to hike prices. The devaluation of sterling has also made it more difficult for overseas competitors to undercut UK prices. Contractors bearing the brunt of increases will have to suffer until they are able to raise customer prices or pass the pain on to subcontractors. Specialist subcontractors are already complaining that the main contractors, instead of passing on progress payments to subcontractors, are hanging on to the money for as long as possible. Most contracts, they say, require subcontractors to be paid within 28 days of submitting an invoice. According to one structural steel supplier, its average waiting period for payment has been 50 days after submitting invoices. It adds that a wait of several months for payments is not uncommon and during this time there is always the risk that the main contractor or final client might go out of business. Main contractors and sub-contractors also complain about abuse of contract clauses which allow clients to retain some of the money owed to contractors, sometimes for several years, as insurance against defects emerging once work is completed. Construction remains a very tough business.</p>

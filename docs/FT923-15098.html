			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Few bets placed on a new Nigerian political order: This weekend's elections, says Julian Ozanne, are the biggest test yet for promised return to civilian rule NIGERIA goes to the polls tomorrow, marking thecritical penultimate step in a precarious return to civilian rule for black Africa's most populous country. Nationwide elections for the 91-member Senate and 589-seat House of Representatives will be the greatest test so far for the transitional programme to democracy put in train seven years ago when General Ibrahim Babangida seized power in a military coup. The process is designed to end in a formal hand-over to a civilian president in January and the inauguration of the so-called Third Republic. However, hopes that the programme would usher in a new political order free from the corruption and ethnic and religious tensions which have plagued Nigeria's post-colonial history have disintegrated. Most Nigerians feel remote from the artificial two-party system imposed on the country by army decree and from elections which have been overshadowed by some of Nigeria's most violent religious and anti-poverty riots. The subsequent heavy-handed arrest of five popular pro-democracy activists, released on bail on Monday after 42 days' detention, has further sidelined Saturday's elections. To make matters worse, the National Electoral Committee announced only a week ago that 32 candidates were disqualified and that the two parties, the Social Democratic Party and the National Republican Convention, had four days to present new names. No reasons were given. The growing body of vocal pro-democracy critics seized on the disqualifications as yet another in a list of fundamental flaws, which, they say, include the government's decision four months ago to wipe 20m names off the voters' register, the imposition of the two-party system, the absence of ideological differences in the party manifestos drawn up by government officials, and the use of draconian detention powers. 'We want the right to form our own political parties and vote for the policies and leaders we like,' said Dr Beko Ransome-Kuti, one of the released activists. 'We don't want to be told what to do by generals. We want the right to have the kind of democratic freedoms you have in Britain.' Dr Ransome-Kuti, chairman of the Campaign for Democracy, wants the programme suspended and is trying to mobilise support for establishment of a sovereign national conference of all political groups to decide the country's political system and constitutional future. However, unless the democracy movement can organise mass action, Gen Babangida will not meet their demands. Many Nigerians also believe that calls for a national conference, or any disruption of the established process, could give Gen Babangida and his military clique the opportunity to extend their rule again. We know the 'programme is a complete sham and is thoroughly undemocratic,' said one senatorial aspirant. 'But as long as Babangida continues to head towards the 1993 hand-over, then we're prepared to play ball, no matter the costs. We've got to make sure he can get out if he really wants to. Many soldiers want their turn at power and money and are just looking for an excuse.' The pro-democracy movement argues that, unless the proposed transition is changed, any regime which takes over will lack a democratic base and popular support, inevitably implode and lead to another coup. They say that, with the return of many former political heavyweights from the discredited previous civilian regime and the re-emergence of bitter political squabbling and 'money politics', the prospects for a credible political system are slim. Some even suggest that Gen Babangida has designed and manipulated the programme to ensure that a Third Republic would start life with a poisoned pill. Even those who believe Gen Babangida will honour his promise to step down in January are looking not to tomorrow's elections but to the 1996 polls as the first opportunity to build a democratic system. Questions are also being raised about the kind of economic situation a civilian regime would inherit. A standby agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is now almost impossible before year's end, given Gen Babangida's repeated rejection of an increase in the domestic price of petroleum and the government's apparent unwillingness to rein in rampant spending. Failure to come to terms with the IMF rules out the possibility of a Paris Club rescheduling of Nigeria's Dollars 31bn (Pounds 16.7bn) external debt and will probably mean the accumulation of arrears on this year's Dollars 5.4bn debt-service payments. Any incoming administration will immediately be faced with severe internal and external indebtedness. 'Babangida's grand dream to retire gracefully to his home in Niger State and leave behind a new political culture and a sound economy is now a ridiculous fantasy,' said a western diplomat. 'He's messed it up, probably not deliberately, through incompetence and the greed of his army cohorts.' It is with great uncertainty, therefore, that Nigerians will cast their votes - an uncertainty compounded by the silence on how the 19-man Armed Forces Ruling Council, Gen Babangida's legislative body, will function alongside the National Assembly until next January. Nobody seems to be betting on how the next six months will unfold, probably not even the nation's military rulers.</p>

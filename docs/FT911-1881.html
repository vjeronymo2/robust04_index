			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Arts: Crisis brews for London arts funding The future of a hundred arts companies in London, including such established names as the Almeida Theatre, the King's Head, the Photographer's Gallery and Dance Umbrella, hangs in the balance following the decision of Ealing Council on Tuesday to reject the proposed Pounds 29m budget for the London Borough Grants Scheme, suggesting instead an expenditure of Pounds 26m. A Crisis in London Arts Funding Steering Group had already been set up to fight the lower than expected Pounds 29m budget, which reduced the arts grants allocated by the LBGC (which also funds welfare projects) from Pounds 3m to Pounds 2m, involving the immediate loss of money to 16 companies including the Almeida, (Pounds 55,000); the ICA (Pounds 55,000); The Photographer's Gallery (Pounds 47,000); and Greenwich Theatre (Pounds 45,000). Now the vote at Ealing throws the future of the reduced sum into jeopardy. The LBGS meets again on May 8 for another attempt to fix a budget, which requires a two thirds majority. Even if it re-establishes the Pounds 29m budget, which is by no means certain, the cheques for the surviving arts beneficiaries will not come through until June, three months into the current financial year. The confirmed loss of grants, and the uncertainty over the future, has already resulted in staff cuts at 40 per cent of the companies who have had LBGS funding axed. Timothy Mason, for ten years Director of the Scottish Arts Council, is to take over as Chief Executive of the new London Arts Board, which succeeds the defunct Greater London Arts in October. GLA lost the confidence of the Arts Council and the larger London arts organisations who were to be allocated to it under the Government arts devolution policy. By choosing such an experienced administrator the Council will hope to restore faith in the concept of London having its own arts board.</p>

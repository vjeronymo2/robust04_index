			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 8/2/1994 -- "An Arbitrary  Differentiation That Defies Historical Truth" is the title under  which the editorial of the daily newspaper DIMINEATA comments  the recent statements made by the president of the Republic of  Moldova, Mircea Snegur, relative to the existence of a "Moldovan  people," allegedly different from the Romanian people.    As is known, the Republic of Moldova is inhabited by 64  percent ethnic Romanians, speakers of a genuine albeit slightly  archaic Romanian, and live on more than three quarters of what  used to be the historical Romanian province of Bessarabia,  annexed in 1940 by the former Soviet Union on the strength of  the Soviet-German pact signed by the then foreign ministers  Molotov and Ribbentrop. After the fall at the end of the ninth  decade of the totalitarian regimes in the East of Europe, more  and more voices in the Republic of Moldova proclaimed the return  of this Romanian territory to its mother land Romania.    The editorial quoted above cautions that the reoccurrence in  Snegur's declaration of older theses of the Soviet ideology  periodically aired, first in the twenties and thirties, then in  the forties and fifties and in the Brezhnev epoch, which  advocate a clear distinction between the Romanian people and  culture and the "Moldovan people and culture."    TINERETUL LIBER finds Snegur's attitude as a strategic  response to Moscow's offensive attempts to regain its commanding  role over its former republics, but finds no excuse for his  impudence of "denying his own roots, and doing this on behalf of  those he is representing." The newspaper terms Bucharest's  reaction as "still pale" and warns that Romanian should not  neglect the national interest and overlook the political  significance and the emotional impact Snegur's statement carries.    Under the heading "Romanian Political Circles Vehemently  Condemn Mircea Snegur's Switch" CURIERUL NATIONAL groups  opinions by Romanian political forces on Mircea Snegur's  statements. "Preposterous" is the label applied to them by  Peasant Party [PNTCD] Vice President Ioan Diaconescu. The  ruling Social Democracy Party of Romania (PDSR) finds them  "inciting and offending," and Romanian National Unity Party  (PUNR) Vice President Cornel Brahas qualifies them as "an overt  attempt at our integrity, a tragical treason of the Romanian  kin."    COTIDIANUL defines the lines of action against such  aberrations in the following terms: "The awareness of the  physical, spiritual and moral geography, the unharnessing of the  Romanians' power to create, to give vigour and substance to the  national idea through the opening toward the European spirit  have become the commandments of our ties against the dangers  springing from the rebirth of the Zhirinovskiy-type [Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy, leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia]  imperial nationalism and expansionism."</p>

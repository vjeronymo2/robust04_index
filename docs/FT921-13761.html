			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / Leading Article: Easing the German pain THE Bundesbank's influence on monetary conditions throughout Europe is reasonably clear-cut; but the way in which it makes its decisions can be more obscure. The headline-making  1/2 percentage point increase in the German Lombard rate before Christmas was pushed through by the regional members of the Bundesbank council. This was against the advice of its president, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, who - more alive to the international sensitivities - favoured a more restrained increase of just  1/4 per cent. Not merely because of the Bundesbank's occasional ability to surprise, there is nervous speculation about when it will start to reduce rates again. Having helped bolster European growth during 1989-91 as a by-product of its unification-induced boom, Germany is now accused of choking neighbouring economies with its tight monetary grip. In the wake of the recent easing of US and Japanese monetary policy, the pressure on the Germans to cut rates will increase at this weekend's meeting of finance ministers of the seven largest industrialised countries. As the German economy slows over the next few months, the Bundesbank will certainly have leeway to lower interest rates. First, however, some crucial conditions will have to be fulfilled. After last year's pay settlements of 7 per cent or more, the Bundesbank is right to be worried about high 1992 pay claims. The interest rate hike was partly an attempt to call the trade unions to order, and there are small signs that it may be working. The IG Metall metal-workers' union last week acknowledged the inappropriateness of 10 per cent-plus pay claims, and a 5 to 6 per cent pay deal looks just possible in the steel sector, without the threatened strike. Exaggerated deals Of still greater significance will be the outcome in the public sector, where unions have lodged double-digit claims reminiscent of the exaggerated deals at the beginning of the 1970s, which sparked off the Bundesbank's most savage post-war tightening to date. Aggressive demands of employees in the public sector may be an understandable reaction to Chancellor Helmut Kohl's botched handling of last year's tax increases. But the unions must understand that, unless they moderate their behaviour, they will bear a good deal of the responsibility for prolonging the Bundesbank's squeeze. For the public service workers union, OTV, putting workers out of jobs in interest-rate sensitive industries both within and outside Germany is hardly a contribution to international solidarity. Basic criticism Yet the main blame for Germany's monetary strains falls on the government. The Bundesbank has recently scaled back its carping at Bonn's failure to put post-unity financing on to a sounder footing through spending and subsidy cuts, partly because its rhetoric had so little effect during 1990-91. But distressingly little has happened to invalidate its basic criticism: that large public sector deficits are forcing the central bank to make too much of the running in the bid to control inflation. The core public sector deficit - running at 4 per cent of gross national product - is still too high, especially as the economy is slowing significantly. Of still greater concern is the proliferation of debt accumulating in off-budget financing vehicles such as the Unity Fund, as well as heavy burdens caused by support for exports to the former Soviet Union. Once the temporary 12-month income tax surcharge runs out this summer, Bonn is relying on a VAT rise next year to restrain the deficit. But tougher action will be required to meet the challenge. In post-war economic cycles, the Bundesbank has waited on average seven months before easing interest rates from their peaks. This time round, the rest of Europe has good reason to expect that the Bundesbank will want to move sooner. But foreigners' demands for action should be lodged with Mr Kohl, not Mr Schlesinger. Unless Germany brings its newly enlarged economy into better balance, it will not only punish its neighbours, but will also suffer itself.</p>

			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Chambers reject BES abolition THE Business Expansion Scheme should be replaced, the British Chambers of Commerce says today in its Budget submission to the chancellor. The chambers accept that the 10-year-old scheme has offered 'little help for potential start-up businesses'. But rather than being abolished with no replacement - as the government intends - there should be new arrangements which help to stimulate interest among small investors. Chambers of commerce representatives will meet Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, tomorrow and stress the need for next month's Budget to demonstrate support for the small business sector. The chambers' other specific proposals include improving the loan guarantee scheme, lowering export guarantee scheme premiums and freezing mortgage tax relief and personal allowances as part of the drive to control public expenditure. Its Budget submission argues that if value added tax is introduced on items currently zero-rated, the change should be phased in. However, Ms Harriet Harman, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, warned yesterday that the extension of VAT would cost many thousands of jobs. She said research showed that 22,000 jobs would disappear in the road transport industry if VAT were imposed at the full 17.5 per cent rate, and 20,000 in printing and publishing. 'The gain to the Treasury from the extension of VAT could be wiped out by the wider damage caused to the economy,' she said. The Catholic Housing Aid Society says in its Budget submission that mortgage interest relief should be withdrawn from April 1995.</p>

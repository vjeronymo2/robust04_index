			<p><P> March 21, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIRST EXECUTIVE OFFICERS WON'T APPEAR BEFORE ASSEMBLY PANEL  </P> <P> Officers of First Executive Corp. have declined to appear voluntarily before an  Assembly committee investigating the life insurance company's extensive junk  bond investments, officials said Tuesday.  </P> <P> Patrick Johnston (D-Stockton), chairman of the Assembly Finance and Insurance  Committee, seeks legislation to protect policyholders against the insolvency of  their life insurance company.  </P> <P> Los Angeles-based First Executive in January announced a $515-million writeoff  against fourth-quarter profit to reflect the lower value of its junk bond  portfolio.  </P> <P> Last month, Johnston subpoenaed Fred Carr, First Executive's chief executive,  and Doug Marcian, its chief investment officer, regarding their use of a  strategy of junk bond investments engineered by Michael Milken.  </P> <P> In a letter, First Executive President Alan Snyder told Johnston that Carr and  Marcian would not testify because of the time needed for preparation and "the  adverse publicity that would be generated by a hearing in which the central  focus is the company's standing in the insurance community."  </P></p>

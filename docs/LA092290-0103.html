			<p><P> September 22, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUNTY TOLD TO STOP 'COERCING' WORKERS TO GIVE TO CHARITIES  </P> <P> A Superior Court judge ordered Los Angeles County administrators Friday to stop  "coercing and intimidating" their employees into contributing to United Way,  the Brotherhood Crusade and other major charities that solicit in the  workplace.  </P> <P> Judge G. Keith Wisot, calling the solicitations "shameful," ruled that fund  raising should not be conducted during business hours, but only during periods  such as lunches, breaks and before and after work.  </P> <P> Last year, another judge had issued a temporary order limiting such  solicitations to 15 minutes during work. Wisot said, however, that the county  had disregarded that order and that stronger measures were needed to ensure  that employees are not harassed.  </P> <P> Wisot's ruling came as a result of a lawsuit filed in Los Angeles by a group of  county employees who said during the trial that they were illegally forced to  spend thousands of hours soliciting for the charities, instead of doing their  jobs.  </P> <P> They testified that they were ordered by superiors to threaten new employees  with firing if they did not make donations, and that they were forced to attend  fund-raising rallies on county time and perform chores such as washing dishes  during the events. They also said supervisors' yearly bonuses depended, in  part, on how much money they were able to raise from subordinates.  </P> <P> Wisot ordered the county to cease maintaining a "hit list" of names of workers  who declined to donate. He also instructed management to tell employees that  participation in fund raising is voluntary and that they would suffer no  adverse employment consequences if they did not participate.  </P> <P> County administrators argued that the fund raising is legal and that the court  has no authority to oversee its administration. Attorney Stephen Morris, who  represented the county, disputed allegations that worker harassment was  involved in soliciting the donations.  </P> <P> In 1989, a total of $2.7 million was raised for charity from among the county's  70,000 workers.  </P> <P> Chief Administrative Officer Richard B. Dixon, the highest-ranking county  administrative employee and a member of the United Way board, testified that  the program is voluntary and that there had been no intimidation of, or  retaliation against, workers who did not participate.  </P> <P> But the plaintiffs introduced a 1987 memo in which Dixon told campaign  coordinators: "I expect 100% participation by our employees. If there are  exceptions to this, I will meet with you individually one week prior to the  close of the campaign to discuss your division's lack of support."  </P> <P> For years, United Way has been afforded time by government agencies and private  firms to solicit during working hours. Employees can arrange to have weekly  donations directly withdrawn from their paychecks.  </P> <P> Friday's ruling applies only to county workers.  </P></p>

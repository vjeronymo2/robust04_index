			<p><P> January 3, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Bank of Boston to Write Off $300 Million: Bank of Boston Corp. said its  earnings for the final quarter of 1989 will be reduced by about $300 million  largely because of problem real estate loans and the uncertainty of the New  England economy. The large regional banking company also said it added $280  million to its loan-loss reserves to cover future losses. However, Bank of  Boston said it expects to break even for the three months ended Dec. 31 and  earn a profit for the full year.  </P></p>

			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Dutch farmers face phosphorous curbs Dutch pig and poultry farmers will be forced by 1995 to cut the amount of pollution-causing manure their animals produce to 30 per cent below 1986 levels under a law passed by parliament yesterday, the ANP news agency said, reports Reuter from the Hague. If the farmers cannot reduce the amount of phosphorous nutrient in the manure applied to land by 30 per cent they will will be required to cut animal numbers. Further reductions will be required up to the year 2000 to achieve levels the land can absorb.</p>

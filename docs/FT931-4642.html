			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: BBA BBA's decision to switch half of its dollar borrowings back into sterling looks like a perverse consequence of accounting conventions. Like others, the company had previously matched its foreign assets against borrowings on the argument that this protected it from exchange rate movements - any fall in sterling would increase the value of foreign assets and debts equally. Low dollar interest rates also kept down borrowing costs, and the practice conveniently transfers profits back to the UK to reduce advance corporation tax problems. However, sterling's fall produces strange effects in such groups' consolidated balance sheets. Because their capital is in sterling and much of the debt is in overseas subsidiaries, any fall in the pound raises the level of balance sheet gearing. Yet provided the debt is properly matched against real business interests, and interest cover in local currencies is adequate, the gearing rise is a purely accounting phenomenon. BBA's management, however, does not want to see gearing rise any more as a result of any further fall in sterling. Hence the transfer of debt. Its concern is understandable given the excessive importance attached to gearing. Yet crystallising a foreign exchange loss because conventions struggle to cope with the real world is the accounting tail wagging the operational dog. The Accounting Standards Board might care to look at what is clearly an inadequate method for translating foreign subsidiaries into consolidated sterling accounts.</p>

			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Survey of Poland (28): A scramble to modernise - Steel The 17,000 workers who pour through the arched gates of the the Nowa Huta steelworks each day have one pressing question: how many of them will keep their jobs. Ten years ago the plant, which sprawls over 10 square kilometres near Krakow, employed 35,000 people. But now production levels have been cut by two thirds. Like the rest of the Polish steel industry, Nowa Huta will spend the next few years fighting for survival. If it succeeds, its managers expect it will employ only 8,000 people. According to a Polish government assessment of the future of the steel industry last autumn, 'without restructuring the domestic market could be lost and most Polish steel mills will be threatened by bankruptcy'. The challenge facing the industry is that the type and amount of steel produced in the past were largely geared to the needs of the Soviet Union. That demand has now collapsed, together with much of the requirements from Polish industry. As a result, production of crude steel slumped from a peak of 20m tonnes a year in the early 1980s to 9.8m tonnes in 1992. With the gradual economic recovery, total steel production picked up slightly last year, and the industry ministry expects it to reach 11m tonnes this year. Steelmakers can also look forward to a longer-term increase in demand from the huge task of modernising Poland's infrastructure and industry. But to gain a share of that market, Poland's 26 steel mills, 18 of which were built before the first world war, will have to cut costs and capacity, and then modernise. On the back of a study commissioned from a Canadian consortium including consultants Ernst &amp; Young, the government estimates that no more than 11.7m tonnes a year of liquid steel capacity is needed, even allowing for an upsurge in domestic demand. 'Past construction booms only took about 2m tonnes a year,' says Mr Wiktor Laszczyk, adviser on steel at the ministry of industry. 'And a quarter of our steel used to be exported, almost entirely to the Soviet Union - those markets have gone.' The government also wants continuous casting, an energy-efficient means of production and an international barometer of the level of modernisation, to rise from 8 per cent to 75 per cent of production. Energy-inefficient open hearth furnaces also need to be replaced by oxygen furnaces, and mills which produce semi-finished steel need to invest in processing of finished products, it says. As well as cutting raw material and electricity costs, those changes will curb some of the pollution belched out by the steel works - they are some of the largest emitters of nitrogen oxides and sulphur dioxide in Poland. But some of the implications of restructuring have been more controversial, in particular the Canadian Consortium's argument that at least six mills should close. Estimates also suggest that employment might have to fall from 147,000 to 43,000, although half the people affected might be transfered to newly-formed service and engineering companies. Instead of complete closure of mills, the government has tended to recommend scaling down and sometimes merger. In Nowa Huta's case, restructuring may mean merger with the rival giant steel works Huta Katowice to improve production of sheet steel, the government has suggested. According to the industry ministry, the investment needed to achieve the industry's transformation runs to some Dollars 4bn to Dollars 5bn, Dollars 1.8bn in capital costs and the rest in redundancy payments and management changes. Mr Laszczyk insists, though, that 'the mills will have to find the money for restructuring. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade prevents us giving subsidies'. The money will have to come from the mills' own resources or from foreign credits, he said, although the government has indicated it may be prepared to guarantee foreign credits, as it has done at Nowa Huta and Huta Katowice. It will also press ahead with setting up mills as stand-alone companies, prior to privatisation. The price of failure, if the Polish steel industry fails to make this transformation, is that Poland would have to find some Dollars 4bn to Dollars 5bn a year in foreign currency to pay for steel imports. 'The government will not allow liquidation of the industry to happen as we could not fill that gap in foreign trade,' according to Mr Laszczyk. 'I am sure, therefore, that the industry will survive.' The steps the industry takes in the next few years in its scramble towards modernisation will determine whether that prediction comes true.</p>

			<p><P> May 4, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIRST IMPRESSIONS: DINING WITH DISNEYANA AT MICKEY'S KITCHEN  </P> <P> If you can imagine picking up a pizza and a package of Mickey Mouse  corn-on-the-cob holders inside Disneyland's It's a Small World ride, you'll  have a pretty good idea of dinner at Mickey's Kitchen. The new Disney-owned  restaurant inside a Disney store at Montclair Plaza, (714) 624-8111, is  something of a suburban Toontown.  </P> <P> Near the front is Winnie-the-Pooh country, with a separate yogurt bar; off in a  corner is a replica of Tony's Italian restaurant, the setting for the love  scene in "Lady and the Tramp." Sing-along videos of Disney hits constantly play  on a big-screen TV (the words and a bouncing mouse head appear as subtitles).  </P> <P> You order at a counter that looks like a jazzed-up McDonald's. Here, the  uninitiated stare at the menu  </P> <P> for long periods of time. Should it be a Goofy Burger? A Supercalifragi-Chicken  Salad? Piglet Corkscrew Fries? Mouseketeer Meals (choose from Huey, Dewey or  Louie) come with a prize. If you're confused, a helpful employee will greet you  ("Hi! Welcome to Mickey's Kitchen!") and tell you that a P and J Handwich  stands for peanut butter and jelly. (Disneyland may be the happiest place on  earth, but Mickey's Kitchen must be the friendliest -- relentlessly so.)  </P> <P> And how does Disney food taste? A lot like the burgers you get outside Space  Mountain -- in other words, food only a kid could love. But as one Mickey's  Kitchen worker confided, "Everyone who comes here is a kid, really."

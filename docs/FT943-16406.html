			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / Dockyard David battles for contract against Goliaths: Chris Tighe reports on the small shiprepair company slugging it out with the industry's giants for the Pounds 30m Sir Bedivere refit In the battle for the Pounds 30m Sir Bedivere landing ship refit, which the Ministry of Defence will award this month, Mr Eric Welsh is playing David against the Goliaths of British shipbuilding. His six-year-old shiprepair company, Tees Dockyard, is slugging it out against most of the industry's biggest names: Yarrow, Swan Hunter, the Rosyth Royal Dockyard, and a joint tender from Devonport Royal Dockyard and VSEL. Against a background of dwindling defence spending, the 21-month project to lengthen and extensively modify Bedivere is well worth fighting for. The future of Swan Hunter, in receivership since May 1993, hangs on the order: without it the Tyneside company's only prospective buyer, French-based Constructions Mecaniques de Normandie, will back off, making closure highly probable. Other contenders are desperately keen to win Bedivere to maintain employment and get a foothold in the ship conversion marketplace. There is in this bitter contest a grim satisfaction for Mr Welsh - it vindicates his conviction, demonstrated at Tees Dockyard, that ship lengthening is a promising market in these cost and speed-conscious times. 'We identified this as a damn big niche in the market, the other people have just realised it,' he says. 'The last 12 lengthenings in this country have been done by this group, and the big ones have been done here.' Vessels are cut in half and a new section inserted, returning the ship to service in as little as 30 days. Tees Dockyard has adapted offshore fabrication industry practices, mounting the ship on wheeled trailers, to speed up the task of dragging the severed vessel apart. Bedivere, a Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA) vessel built on the Tyne at Hawthorn Leslie in 1966, is the first MoD vessel to be lengthened. A 12-metre section is to be inserted, to bear the additional weight of replacing her aluminium superstructure - found in the Falklands War to be a fire risk - with steel. Her sister ships, Geraint and Percival, may be similarly modified and whichever bidder gets Bedivere should be strongly placed to compete. Mr Welsh, managing director of Tees Dockyard, has spent two years gearing up for Bedivere - gaining the BS 5750 Part 1 quality standard to meet MoD requirements and improving his facilities, in which he has invested more than Pounds 5m since 1988. A labourer's son, he served his apprenticeship as a shipwright at Smith's Dock on the Tees, rising to become managing director of now defunct Sunderland Shipbuilders. He reopened Smith's Dock's disused shiprepair facilities in late 1987, in partnership with Mr Albert Le Blond, Sunderland-based chairman of the Wear Dockyard Group. Tees Dockyard has since carried out nearly 400 jobs, 26 of them for the MoD, including voyage repairs on the Bedivere in May. Mr Welsh is daunted neither by his competitors' size nor the value of the Bedivere contract, worth at least twice Tees Dockyard's current annual Pounds 16m turnover. 'We consider in this type of work we have more experience than the other people and we're the most competitive.' Rivals contend they too are highly competitive. Although most have done no ship lengthenings before they argue their shipbuilding experience gives them the necessary expertise. Privately however one describes the Bedivere as 'a pig of a job'. While most yards have been slashing workforce numbers - VSEL is down from 14,000 in 1990 to 6,000 now and Devonport has just announced a further 850 redundancies - Mr Welsh has been recruiting. His core workforce is now 300. For Bedivere he would hire another 500, on contract. His initial workforce of 27 came from 1,300 who lost their jobs with the closure in early 1987 of Smith's Dock, Teesside's last shipyard. Of these 25 are still with him, the other two retired at 67. Engineering manager Mr Ian Smailes, one of the 27, attributes Tees Dockyard's growth to sheer determination. 'This yard got back on its feet on sentiment, there was no way anything was going to stop us. The lads had been out of work, they were sick and wanted to work. We pushed ourselves to limits we didn't know we had.' The same applies to Mr Welsh: after a car accident in mid 1988, he ran the company from his hospital bed for months. Winning Bedivere would be a personal coup for him and his team. General manager and director Mr Ken Raper was the RFA's marine superintendent for 10 years, a job in which he looked after Bedivere. The MoD, says Mr Welsh, has insisted that value for money, not politics, will be the deciding factor. But the behind-the-scenes political lobbying for the contract is intense. Should Tees Dockyard not win there will be disappointment but no hand-wringing, he says. 'We'll just go and get some more work.'</p>

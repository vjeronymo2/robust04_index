			<p><P> April 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GLOOM IN BURBANK  </P> <P> As a homeowner and proud resident of Burbank, I am compelled to write after  reading Betsy Bates' article, "City Proud of Progress Shrugs Off Gag" (April  1).  </P> <P> I, too, am enamored with Burbank's small-town feeling, its efficient public  services and its sense of community pride.  </P> <P> These are the very same reasons why my family chose to make Burbank our home.  </P> <P> However, I would like to point out that Bates failed to mention that Burbank  Councilman Tom Flavin, who was featured in her article, is the subject of a  current citywide, resident-initiated recall petition (along with Councilman  Michael Hastings). Councilmen Flavin and Hastings have politically endorsed a  multitude of massive commercial development projects that can threaten the very  same qualities for which we all hold so dearly.  </P> <P> If these projects are passed as proposed by the City Council, Burbank will no  longer remind residents of . . . "little Midwestern towns." The plans call for  towering office buildings throughout the city, many abutting residential  neighborhoods; many of our lovely shopping streets will be widened and  oxygen-giving, shade-bearing trees (some as old as 40 years) will be removed;  extensive commuter traffic will cut through our residential neighborhoods, and  Burbank's quality of life will vastly deteriorate.  </P> <P> KATE MORRIS  </P> <P> Burbank  </P></p>

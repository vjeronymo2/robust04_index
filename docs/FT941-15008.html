			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / DTI shake-up scraps post of chief scientist The Department of Trade and Industry is to abolish the post of chief scientist as part of a reorganisation of top jobs aimed at improving the department's work to assist industrial competitiveness. The announcement was greeted with 'disappointment' by Ms Fiona Steele, head of technology policy at the Confederation of British Industry, who said the abolition of the science adviser's job 'diminishes the role of science and technology right across the government'. Dr John Mulvey, secretary of the Save British Science campaign, said it would be 'a serious step backwards' while Dr Lewis Moonie, Labour science spokesman, called the change 'sadly predictable'. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said the changes marked 'another step in restructuring the department to ensure that it is best placed to fulfil my principal objective of helping UK business to win in world markets'. Under the reorganisation, taking place on March 1, scientific issues will be dealt with by officials examining broad industrial problems in a revamped 'industrial sponsorship' division. Science and technology currently have their own separate unit. The department will not seek a replacement for Mr Geoffrey Robinson, chief science and technology adviser, who leaves next month after less than two years. The department denied that the move devalued the role of science and technology. 'We are incorporating this area most closely within the rest of the organisation,' it said. In recent years the DTI has reduced funding for research and development, arguing that this is a job for the private sector, and has focused on promoting good management practice and transfer of existing technologies to companies. Mr Alastair Macdonald, a deputy secretary currently in charge of one of the DTI's industry divisions, will supervise all the department's work in 'sponsoring' specific business sectors. The department's work on technology transfer and the spreading of management best-practice will be linked with efforts to assist small and medium-size enterprises.</p>

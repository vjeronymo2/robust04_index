			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Nuclear Development in S. Korea Denounced" -- KCNA </F> headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, May 9 (KCNA) -- Chong Sin-hyok,  vice-chairman of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of  the Fatherland, issued a statement to the press Saturday, in  which he scathingly denounced the South Korean puppet clique's  moves to develop nuclear arms as a heinous, anti-national crime  intended to inflict a nuclear holocaust upon the entire fellow  countrymen and turn the 3,000-ri national territory into a  barren land.    He charged that the South Korean puppet clique have  already acquired the capability to make nuclear weapons and  produced and concealed several nukes in secret.    The statement said:    The International Atomic Energy Agency, reduced to a maid of  the United States, has connived at the military nuclear  facilities in South Korea, not announcing the result of  investigation of them, while openly taking issue with the DPRK's  experimental reactor for a peaceful use. This clearly shows  that the agency is devoid of impartiality.    If the United States and the IAEA Secretariat have  willingness to prevent proliferation of nuclear weapons and keep  peace on the globe, they should, first of all, pay due attention  to the South Korean puppets' nuclear development on an extremely  dangerous stage and urgently take an appropriate step against it.    The statement earnestly called upon the entire fellow  countrymen in the North and the South of Korea and overseas to  actively turn out in the just struggle to check and frustrate  the South Korean puppet clique's dangerous development of  nuclear weapons.</p>

			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / UK Company News: SBC left with 45% of new Lloyd's trust Swiss Bank Corporation has been left with a substantial number of shares, which are trading well below issue price, in a new Lloyd's investment company following poor investor interest. The bank had hoped to raise up to Pounds 50m for Matheson Lloyd's Investment Trust, via the issue of 50m ordinary shares at 100p. SBC had agreed to underwrite 25m of the shares. The bank said yesterday that it had managed to place only about 8m, mainly with continental European investors, leaving it holding about 70 per cent of MLIT's shares. Subsequently it has sold about 5m shares to Fidelity at about 80p each, according to market estimates. After other disposals, SBC has been left holding about 45 per cent. The shares yesterday closed at 82p, though the bank argues that does not take account of the value of warrants, entitling shareholders to subscribe for one share at 100p, issued with every five shares. The deal has left SBC with a paper loss but Mr Michael Kershaw, executive director at the bank, said: 'The company should be judged by the quality of its underwriting results and not by its short term share price performance. We are extremely happy with the quality of the capacity we have obtained for 1995.'</p>

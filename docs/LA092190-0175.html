			<p><P> September 21, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> JAPANESE ASSAIL ENTHRONEMENT  </P> <P> Nearly 1,000 people sued the government today to block the use of $58.8 million  in public funds for the enthronement rites of Emperor Akihito in November.  </P> <P> "We believe the use of our tax money for ceremonies that have strong religious  links goes against the constitutional separation of politics and religion,"  said Masato Kotani, an organizer of the lawsuit involving 987 plaintiffs.  </P> <P> The ceremonies will be the first under Japan's postwar constitution, which  states that the emperor is a symbol of the Japanese people rather than a living  god, and bans any religious activity by the government.  </P></p>

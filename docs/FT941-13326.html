			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Observer: Another Scoop At last a political breakthrough for the followers of the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, founder and leading exponent of the business of transcendental meditation. Having failed with another great transcendental philosophy - marxism - Joaquim Chissano, Mozambique's president, has taken up the Yogi's ideas. While Chissano chants, some of his cabinet are busily engaged in less ascetic practices, such as making lots of money from the rebuilding of Mozambique's war-torn economy. Maputo-based businessmen, long-accustomed to necessary kickbacks, complain that government officials facing early retirement now have insatiable appetites. But the prospect of Chissano's Frelimo party - in power since 1975 - failing in Mozambique's first elections next October does not cheer spirits either.

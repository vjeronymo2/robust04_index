			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Xiao Longlian (5135 7893 5114) ] </F>   [Text] Chengdu 25 Apr (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--Sichuan  Province has presented a major measure for opening up to the  world and will change the practice of selling enterprises  suffering deficits, and it plans to sell 33 profitable state  enterprises, including the Changzheng Pharmaceutical Factory, to  firms outside the border.    Prior to this, Sichuan Province has on two occasions  promoted  the sale of a number of enterprises suffering serious deficits  with poor economic results to investors outside the border.  This time, Sichuan plans to offer its resources, and markets as  well, so that the state-owned enterprises to be sold will yield  sound economic results and good returns for investors.    In his briefing at a news conference at an international  symposium on Sichuan's opening up to the outside world and talks  on investment, Vice Governor Diao Jinxiang said that there were  33 state-owned enterprises covering an area of 10 million square  meters, with fixed assets originally valued at some 3.6 billion  yuan, a net value of some 2.4 billion yuan, and 77,000 staff and  workers.    Large and medium-sized enterprises are included in these 32  state-owned enterprises. They are mainly distributed in  Chengdu, Chongqing, Deyang, Mianyang, Leshan, Zigong, and  Neijiang, where communications, transportation, and  telecommunications are developed and which have a solid  industrial foundation. They involve such areas as machinery,  electronics, metallurgy, chemicals, building materials,  pharmaceuticals, textiles, and light industry. Of these, 84.8  percent are profitable enterprises. Although the remainder have  some difficulties at present, they have comparatively great  potential for development and comparatively bright market  prospects. At the symposium, some 10 or 15 key enterprises, the  cream of the batch, with comparatively good conditions in  various aspects will be selected for sale.    While dealing with the way the sale of this batch of  enterprises would be conducted, Diao Jinxiang said: Regarding  the enterprises to be sold, foreign investors can purchase any  of the enterprises in their entirety, or in part, or they can  invest directly as shareholders. Five specific ways can be  adopted, namely: first, selling both the enterprise's property  and land-use rights, with local governments making arrangements  for surplus workers and staffers; second, selling part of the  enterprise's property and land-use rights based on the buyer's  requirements; third, selling both the enterprise's property and  land-use rights under the prerequisite that the buyer makes  arrangements for the enterprise's original staff and worker;  fourth, selling part of the enterprise's property and land-use  rights under the prerequisite that the buyer makes arrangements  for some of the enterprise's staff and workers; and fifth,  transferring the state's shares and those of the legal person to  a joint-stock company. The five ways mentioned above can be  selected through specific negotiations based on the different  circumstances of the enterprises.</p>

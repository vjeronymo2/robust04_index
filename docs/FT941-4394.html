			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Notebooks for number-crunchers Notebook computers have rapidly become part of the accoutrements of business travel, writes Louise Kehoe. Yet for users involved in heavy-duty number crunching, the standard notebook PC is inadequate. Two offerings may provide solutions. IBM has introduced a portable version of the Unix workstation. The N40 is based on the PowerPC microprocessor jointly developed by IBM, Apple Computer and Motorola. Priced at Dollars 12,000, the N40 incorporates an active matrix colour display. Taking a different tack, Compaq Computer has introduced a family of notebooks based on Intel's latest 486 DX2 and DX4 microprocessors. Compaq has eliminated the cumbersome AC adapter and cables by building the adapter into the computer, which still weighs less than 7lb. Prices range from Dollars 3,300 to Dollars 6,500. Compaq: US, 713 370 0670. IBM: US, 914 945 3884.</p>

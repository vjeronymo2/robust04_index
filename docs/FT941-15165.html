			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / Monday Interview: Healthy, wealthy . . . and wiser - Having sold his empire, Yves Saint-Laurent is a happier man On Wednesday the opulent ballroom of the Hotel Intercontinental in Paris will be filled to capacity when Yves Saint-Laurent takes his bow at the end of his latest haute couture collection. In the old days the Saint-Laurent show provided the glittering finale to Paris couture week as befits one of the world's most famous designers and the patron saint of French fashion. But couture is not what it used to be. The collections have become publicity stunts for the scents and sunglasses that bear the designers' names. The organisation of the shows is now so chaotic that, to the fury of the French, Saint-Laurent has been unceremoniously usurped from the final slot by Valentino, an interloping Italian. Yves Saint-Laurent, 57, has probably not even noticed. After the show he will be whisked away behind the bullet-proof windows of his limousine back to the tranquility of his 18th century townhouse on rue de Babylone in Paris. He lives there as a recluse with a few faithful servants, his posse of bodyguards and his treasures: the Matisses in the library, the Edward Burne-Jones tapestry in the salon and the Andy Warhol portraits of Moujik, his beloved dog. For years members of the Paris social scene have spun sad stories about Saint-Laurent's illnesses and addictions, his problems with drink and drugs. But the rumours have died down in the past year. He has dried out, lost weight and now looks much healthier. In any other country Saint-Laurent's traumas might make him prey to scandal or ridicule, but in France they simply add to his stature. He is, after all, an icon in fashion, an industry that is not only economically important to the French but cherished as part of their heritage. His vulnerability, his eccentricities, even his troubled mental history conform completely with the Gallic cliche of the tortured genius traumatised by his own talent. Saint-Laurent says that his problems started at school. He led a sheltered childhood in Algeria, then a French colony, as the adored only son of Charles, a wealthy business man, and his glamorous wife, Lucienne. But school was hell. 'Perhaps I didn't have what it took to be a boy,' he once said. 'I didn't conform. My homosexuality was obvious. They hit me or locked me in the toilets. It was psychological torture.' He escaped to Paris at 17 when he won first prize in a fashion contest. Karl Lagerfeld, the son of a German condensed milk magnate who is now his arch-rival as chief designer of Chanel, came second. Saint-Laurent then spent three months at fashion school before being hired as an assistant by Christian Dior, the grand old man of French fashion. Dior died suddenly in 1957 and Yves, still only 21, was catapulted into the most prestigious position in Paris fashion. His first collection was a triumph. 'Saint-Laurent has saved France', was the headline in Le Figaro. Disaster struck three years later when Marcel Boussac, the machiavellian owner of Dior, loathed one of Saint-Laurent's collections so much that he allegedly 'arranged' for him to be conscripted into the army. Military life was just like school. Saint-Laurent had a nervous breakdown and was admitted to the mental illness ward of a military hospital. He stayed there for three months until he was rescued by Pierre Berge, a young art dealer who had fallen in love with him at a Paris party. Berge then sued Dior, which had replaced Saint-Laurent with another designer, Marc Bohan, for breach of contract and used the FFr40,000 damages to begin their own business. Saint-Laurent went on to dominate 1960s fashion with a string of innovations from micro-minis to trouser suits. He and Berge bought the townhouse on rue de Babylone and a sumptuous chateau in Normandy where they entertained the cream of the jet set. By the late 1970s Saint-Laurent was the toast of the fashion world and fabulously rich, thanks to Pierre Berge's business acumen. But Yves found it increasingly difficult to cope with the stress of the fashion business and the legacy of his childhood traumas. He retreated into his own world to wrestle with his depression. He has rarely been seen in public for the past ten years apart from brief appearances on the catwalk at the end of each collection. Berge moved out of rue de Babylone in the early 1980s. He now has his own townhouse on nearby rue de Bonaparte and a new companion, Robert Merloz, once one of Saint-Laurent's assistants. Saint-Laurent's days as a fashion innovator are long over. As his neuroses mounted, his designs became more conventional. Yet his 1960s achievements have assured his place in the fashion history books and the classic styles in his 1980s and 1990s collections are much more attractive to the middle-aged women who actually buy haute couture than the avant garde looks favoured by the fashion purists. In the meantime Pierre Berge has moved into the limelight. He entered the political arena in the 1980s as a confidant of Francois Mitterrand, the socialist president who, in 1988, made him head of the Opera de Paris. He also stepped up his business deals, culminating in last year's Dollars 650m acquisition of Saint-Laurent by a subsidiary of Elf Aquitaine, the state oil group. The Elf deal caused a furore because of speculation over Mitterrand's suspected involvement and payments of Dollars 72m each to Saint-Laurent and Berge. Berge's fortunes have faltered since the socialists lost power. He has been ousted from the Opera and the police are investigating allegations of insider dealing in Saint-Laurent shares on the eve of the Elf transaction. The final indignity was last autumn's court case when a group of champagne companies forced Saint-Laurent to change the name of its new perfume, Champagne, in France. Saint-Laurent himself seems in better shape than for years. He talks openly about the improvement in his health since he conquered his drink and drug addictions. He has told friends he feels liberated by the sale of the business. He still spends most of his time behind the black lacquered doors of rue de Babylone. But he is often spotted walking his dog and sees more of old friends such as Catherine Deneuve, the actress, and Loulou de la Falaise, his vivacious design assistant. He also makes more frequent visits to his summer house in Marrakesh and his Normandy chateau, where he arrives by helicopter and is then transported around the grounds in a pony and trap. Saint-Laurent even made an appearance at a party given last month by Bettina Graziani, a favourite former model at Dior. Paris-Match approved of his 'tender look, timid smile' and his refusal to drink 'anything other than orange juice and Coca-Cola'.

			<p><P> June 5, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BROADWAY AUDIENCES PEAK BUT TICKET SALES HIT RECORD  </P> <P> Broadway's annual audience has hit a plateau of about 8 million people but its  gross ticket sales of 1989-90 were up 8%, reflecting a rise in box office  prices of up to $60 a ticket, the League of American Theaters and Producers  said today.  </P> <P> The league's report on the season, which ended last Sunday, noted that gross  ticket sales had set a record for the third consecutive year and were at an  all-time high at $283 million. Ticket sales for the 1988-89 season were $262  million.  </P> <P> The news from the road was even better.  </P> <P> Box office receipts for Broadway shows touring the United States and Canada  soared to a new record of $367 million, a 43% increase from $256 million last  season. The national audience was 12.9 million according to the number of  tickets sold, up 33% from 9.7 million last season.  </P> <P> Road companies of Broadway shows had a total of 944 playing weeks, an increase  of 9% over last season.  </P> <P> Broadway's gross ticket sales increase of 8% was realized despite fewer playing  weeks, 1,061, for all 35 productions on Broadway, compared to last season's  1,116 weeks, and could only be ascribed to higher ticket prices.  </P> <P> The season saw orchestra seats for a musical -- "Jerome Robbins Broadway" --  hit $60 for the first time, up $5 from the $55 ticket price for such hits as  "Les Miserables," "Phantom of the Opera," "City of Angels" and "Grand Hotel."  Musicals accounted for 75% of gross receipts and 67% of attendance.  </P> <P> The top price for straight plays was $50, with some charging $40 and $45. Plays  represented only 24% of gross receipts and 32% of attendance. The league said  the average theatergoer paid $35.25 for a ticket, up 7% over last season.  </P> <P> Attendance totaled 8.03 million tickets sold, slightly up from last season's  7.97 million but down from 8.14 million for 1987-88, an all-time high.  </P></p>

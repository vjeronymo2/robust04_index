			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Priority for public transport the cure for road congestion Sir, Mr John Gummer, the UK environment secretary, is right to propose road pricing as a means to internalise external costs and thus reduce congestion in London. He would be wrong, however, to follow Mr John MacGregor, the UK transport secretary, by earmarking the corresponding revenues to fund new road building schemes ('Minister hints at road-pricing to beat London jams', September 21, and 'MacGregor gets show on the road', September 22, respectively). As the American economist Anthony Downs found out some 30 years ago, 'on urban commuter expressways, peak-hour traffic congestion rises to meet maximum capacity'. In other words, congestion, at least in the medium run, is rather independent of the number of roads (or lanes) available. Instead, the government should be satisfied with having found an efficiency-increasing form of taxation or, better still, use the money to pay for public transport improvements which have been overdue for a long time anyway. These would both reduce overcrowding on trains and, thus, by making public transport more attractive, ease road congestion even further.

			<p><P> April 15, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SEGERSTROM WINS ANOTHER YEAR AS CENTER CHAIRMAN  </P> <P> Henry R. Segerstrom, a moving force behind the Orange County Performing Arts  Center, was reelected to a 1-year term as Center chairman Thursday and, at the  same board meeting, recommended that Newport Beach developer William Lyon  succeed him a year from now.  </P> <P> Changes approved in the Center's bylaws Thursday limit future chairmen to three  successive 1-year terms and board members to three successive 3-year terms.  After a 1-year hiatus, board members and chairmen may run again.  </P> <P> The new bylaws provide for the incumbent chairman in his last term to designate  a successor, a recommendation that must then be approved by the Center board's  executive and nominating committees before submission to the full, 55-member  board for approval. Lyon would be subject to final board election in April,  1990, according to Thomas R. Kendrick, Center president.  </P> <P> "I chose Bill Lyon because he's a community leader," Segerstrom said Friday.  "I've worked with him for several years."  </P> <P> The mechanism for succession, Segerstrom said, is "designed to insure a smooth,  ongoing continuity of leadership."  </P> <P> But Segerstrom said he was intent upon looking at the year ahead, and not  beyond.  </P> <P> "My focus is on the upcoming year and the term for which I was elected," he  said. "I have another year as chairman to prove my worth and I'm going to try  my darndest."  </P> <P> Attendance at the Center continued well above the national average last year,  bolstered largely by increased interest in ballet, Kendrick said during the  Center's annual meeting which preceded the elections Thursday night.  </P> <P> However, Kendrick cautioned in his speech, "projected support fell $1 million  short of our target last year," reinforcing his belief that "we . . . are  vulnerable to any economic downturn or substantial programming loss," and that  "bluntly, we are now unduly -- unrealistically -- reliant on box office  revenue."  </P> <P> Still, Kendrick's remarks were largely upbeat, telling Center members that  "it's a distinct pleasure to be able to tell you that 1988 operating results  exceeded all expectations."  </P> <P> Referring to a recent marketing survey recommending that the Center build up to  three additional theaters, Kendrick said, "Clearly, there is now justification  to consider expansion of Center facilities in the decade ahead."  </P> <P> Attendance for all performances at the Center, including those presented by  regional organizations, dipped slightly to 78% last year, he said, but that  figure is still at least 10 points above the national figure. He attributed  this decline to program expansion and patrons who are becoming "more  selective."  </P> <P> Nonetheless, attendance for the greatly expanded number of performances  presented directly by the Center rose from 83% to 85%, Kendrick said.  </P> <P> In the past year, he said, almost 650,000 people attended performances at the  Center. Since the Center opened in September, 1986, he said, more than 1.5  million people, including 175,000 schoolchildren, have attended about 700  performances.  </P> <P> Kendrick reported a net profit on a recent new production of "Babes in Toyland"  and continued virtual sellouts of such Broadway shows as "Me and My Girl" and  "Can-Can." A return engagement of "Cats," he said, set a house record.  </P> <P> "But most of all," he said, "last year's success can be traced directly to our  ballet series. We staked -- and established -- a claim as the No. 1 presenter  of touring ballet on the West Coast. And the community responded beyond my . .  . hopes." Ballet performances increased by 75%, to 44 performances, with an  average paid attendance of 85.4%, which he said was 15 points above the  national average. Ballet was the only Center subscription series that increased  over 1987, he said, nearly breaking even. An $800,000 subsidy for ballet had  been projected.  </P> <P> Box office revenue for performances presented by the Center covered 83% of  operating costs in 1988, compared to 74% in 1987, Kendrick said. The 1988  figure is about 20 points above the national norm for comparable facilities, he  said.  </P> <P> "That figure must -- and will -- inevitably come down as attendance moves to  normal levels," Kendrick said. "That money must be replaced by more support or  the quality of programming -- the key to our success -- will fall, sharply."  </P></p>

			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Strong showing for Old Masters in NY: Saleroom The first major art sale of 1994, at Christie's in New York on Wednesday, confirmed that demand for top-quality antiques is becoming steadily stronger. The auction of Old Master paintings totalled Dollars 15m (Pounds 10m) and was 90 per cent sold by value. Highest price was the Dollars 2.6m paid for a still life of fruit and flowers by the Dutch 18th century artist Jan Van Huysum. Its top pre-sale estimate had been Dollars 1.5m. One of the last major works by the French artist Louis Boilly, who died in 1845, entitled 'A Carnival on the Boulevard of Crime', sold for Dollars 937,500. It shows low life in the Boulevard de Temple in Paris which had a reputation for pleasure. A still life of fruit and marigolds by the 17th century Valencian artist Tomas Hiepes, estimated at up to Dollars 80,000, sold for Dollars 772,500, while a typical Roman vista by Panini was at the top of its estimate, selling for Dollars 640,500. 'We are delighted with the results,' said Rachel Kaminsky, head of Christie's Old Master department. 'Many lots sold well above their estimates and the market overall appears to be much stronger than this time last year'.</p>

Yeltsin in Moscow on 22 December 1993]    [Text] To secure the continued progress and state support  of local government reform, I hereby decree that:    1. Agencies of local self-government will approve their own  lists of the objects (or assets) constituting municipal property  in accordance with Addendum 3 of the Decree of the Russian  Federation Supreme Soviet of 27 December 1991 "On the Division  of State Property in the Russian Federation into Federal  Property, the State Property of Republics Belonging to the  Russian Federation, Krays, Oblasts, the Autonomous Oblast,  Autonomous Okrugs, and the Cities of Moscow and St. Petersburg,  and Municipal Property."    The reclassification of objects (or assets) constituting  municipal property as the state property of members of the  Russian Federation or federal property will be carried out with  the consent of agencies of local self-government or by court  order.    The decisions of agencies of local self-government on the  classification of objects (or assets) as municipal property may  be challenged in a court of law.    2. The list of prerogatives of the representative agency of  local self-government, specified in the Statute on the  Fundamentals of the Organization of Local Self-Government in the  Russian Federation During the Period of Gradual Constitutional  Reform and approved by Russian Federation Presidential Edict No  1760 of 26 October 1993 "On the Reform of Local Self-Government  in the Russian Federation," will be considered complete. Other  prerogatives of local self-government, as specified in the Law  of the Russian Federation "On Local Self-Government in the  Russian Federation," will be exercised by the local  administration.    3. The decisions of agencies of local self-government may be  rescinded only in judicial proceedings.    When certain state prerogatives are transferred to agencies  of local self-government, a procedure may be stipulated for the  rescission of the decisions of the agencies of local  self-government by the transferring government agency.    4. Local self-government leaders will be empowered to hold a  local referendum on the draft statute on local self-government  (or charter), preside over meetings of elected representative  bodies of local self-government, and serve as the heads of the  corresponding administrations.    5. Elections to representative bodies of local  self-government will be scheduled by a decision of the  representative (or legislative) government agency of a member of  the Russian Federation at the request of the head of the  executive branch of government of the member of the Russian  Federation.    Local self-government leaders and other officials of local  administrations may be members of the corresponding  representative bodies of local self-government.    6. The edict of the president of the Russian Federation "On  the Reform of Local Self-Government in the Russian Federation"  will be amended to reword the second paragraph of Subsection 6  as follows: "Elections of previously appointed local  self-government leaders may be scheduled at the same time as  elections to the representative bodies of local self-government  by a decision of the head of the administration (or government)  of the kray, oblast, city of federal status, autonomous oblast,  or autonomous okrug. In these cases the procedure for electing  local self-government leaders will be defined by the head of the  administration (or government) of the corresponding member of  the Russian Federation."    7. The following will be invalid:    Sections 10-28, Subsection 4 of Section 34 (concerning  appeals to superior soviets), Section 35, Subsection 1 of  Section 92, and subsections 1-4 of Section 95 of the Law of the  Russian Federation "On Local Self-Government in the Russian  Federation";    the Law of the RSFSR "On the Status of the People's Deputy  of  the Local Soviet of People's Deputies in the RSFSR" (with the  exception of Section 36).    The head of the local administration will grant the consent  required by the first part of Section 36 of this law for the  dismissal of a people's deputy from his job, his expulsion from  a kolkhoz, other cooperative organization, or academic  institution, or his transfer to a lower-paying job as a  disciplinary penalty.    8. This edict will be submitted to the Federal Assembly of  the Russian Federation for consideration.    9. This edict will go into force at the time it is signed.    [Signed] B.

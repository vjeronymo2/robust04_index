It was  transporting a considerable quantity of military weaponry  destined for distribution throughout the country.    The lot of weapons found hidden in the cabins consisted of  20  pump-action 12-mm rifles made by three different manufacturers,  15 6.65-mm automatic pistols, ammunition for hunting rifles and  handguns, several cylindrical cases containing sighting pieces  for rifles and machine-pistols, infrared binoculars, telescopes,  and ultramodern transmitting and receiving stations. Dozens of  seamen were arrested and several of them turned over to the  Algiers public prosecutor. (Another freighter, the 7,400-ton Ibn  Sirradj, belonging to the same company, was reportedly boarded  by security forces who suspected it was transporting the same  type of merchandise. However, it turned out the vessel was  carrying no weapons.) How could this arsenal have been taken on  board, and who financed this spectacular transaction?    The key to the investigation was the arrest and subsequent  confession of Mialet Hacene, a crewman on the ship in question  and the man allegedly responsible for transshipment of the  merchandise to El Djorf while it moored alongside another vessel  at the Belgian port of Anvers.    This vessel was an 8,100-ton freighter built in the 1970's  and mostly used for "tramping" (transporting varied merchandise  in bulk); it belongs to ULN, a regular shipping company serving  the Europe-North America zone.    Under interrogation, Mialet Hacene admitted to security  officials that certain individuals had contacted him and  insisted he take some merchandise on board without telling him  exactly what it was. As he tells it, he was not in a position to  refuse because they would have threatened to take revenge on his  family.    Hacene stated he was to go to the German port of Hamburg to  meet an Algerian named Djamel Ressaf who was to provide him with  the "packages." However, an unexplained hitch forced changes in  the original plan, and the transfer point was shifted to the  Belgian port of Anvers. The merchandise, delivered by the same  individual, was taken on board El Djorf unknown to the vessel's  captain, officers, and some of the crew.    We recall that Djamel Ressaf, then a fugitive in France, was  sentenced in absentia to death by the Special Court of Algiers  for his role in the terrorist attack that destroyed Houari  Boumediene International Airport.    Twelve charges had been preferred against him. According to  the remand order, he participated with Hocine Abderrahim, Said  Soussen, and Zouaoui in the meeting held at El Biar to plan the  terrorist operation. In July 1993 he was arrested by French  security after expiration of his visitor permit. Nine months  later, Ressaf's trail led to Germany and later Belgium. Was he  deported to one of these countries after his arrest by French  security? Kebir? The possibility cannot be ruled out, especially  since Kebir, as former spokesman for the former FIS [Islamic  Salvation Front], and Oussama Madani, as treasurer, were the  only ones with access to the dissolved party's funds, which are  now deposited in banks overseas.    Ressaf Djamel, who also traveled in Sweden on false identity  papers, was apparently in constant contact with Oussama Madani.  Indeed, it was thanks to this person that Oussama Abassi met in  September 1991 with Bachir Benzeguir, alias "Abu Tarek," the  self-proclaimed "leader" of a Stockholm "cell" of the former FIS  and author of several incendiary communiques, notably the one  threatening German interests after German police arrested Kebir  and Oussama in July of last year.    It would seem, then, that militants of the dissolved  Islamist  party who are now at large in Europe--including several sought  by Algerian justice for terrorist crimes--are still able to find  enough complaisance and accomplices to circulate freely on the  Old Continent. What is worse, these terrorists even go so far as  to flout host-country authorities by indulging in arms  trafficking for the purpose of destabilizing Algeria. But the  question of the day is whether there now exists a maritime  arms-trafficking ring in addition to those identified as  operating across our land borders. Its existence would explain  many mysteries, such as the provenance of certain types of arms,  including Israeli Uzis and Czech Scorpios.    When it agreed to grant asylum to these terrorists, did  Europe fully appreciate the serious consequences of such a  decision?</p>

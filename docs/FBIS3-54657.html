			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In a surprise move, the Uzbek Government has  suspended the publication of two Russian newspapers, PRAVDA and  RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA. No formal explanation has been given.    Since the two papers are printed in Tashkent, the decision  has affected subscribers not only in Uzbekistan but also  Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan, and parts of Kazakhstan and  Turkmenistan.    Local observers say RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA may have been punished  because of its carrying of an article about LDP [Liberal  Democratic Party] leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy in its December  24 issue.</p>

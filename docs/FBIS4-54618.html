			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, May 3 (CTK) -- The most important fact  about the meeting between Slovak Premier Jozef Moravcik and  Hungarian Premier Peter Boross on Sunday [1 May] was that it  took place, although the limited maneuvering space excluded  beforehand a drastic change at least in one of the accumulated  problems, SME writes.    "The inventory fully exposed the two countries' different  views on the problems complicating mutual relations.  Differences in opinion are already appearing in their approach  towards a fundamental agreement which, according to Bratislava,  would guarantee the inviolability of the border defined by the  1920 Treaty of Trianon," the paper says. It notes that Moravcik  believes that the rapid conclusion of a fundamental treaty  between the two countries with a clause on the border would help  resolve other issues. However, Boross favors the opposite  approach; the gradual elimination of problems, starting with  minor ones and ending up with the most serious ones, which would  result in the signing of the basic document.    SME says that both approaches are logical and that Hungary's  attitude need not necessarily be malicious, but only a different  viewing of priorities. Slovakia considers the issue of its  territorial integrity of primary importance, whilst Hungary  considers the minority issue of key importance. "The two issues,  of course, are closely linked but unfortunately they have  blocked each other so far," the paper writes.    "The Komarno inventory showed that the mutual trust deficit  is not so high.... The fact that a week before parliamentary  elections the Hungarian Premier considered it necessary to catch  up with Hungarian opposition leaders as regards contacts with  Slovakia is a signal that the Hungarian voter wants relations  with his neighbor to improve. This can be considered a basis  (for development of bilateral relation) irrespective of who wins  the elections in Hungary," the paper says in conclusion.</p>

			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / International Company News: Banc One sees no further deals this year BANC ONE, the US banking group, is unlikely to make another acquisition this year, Mr John McCoy, chairman, said yesterday, Reuter reports from Milwaukee. 'I think the likelihood of us doing another transaction is less than 10 per cent' this year, Mr McCoy said after a speech to the Wisconsin Bankers' Association. Banc One recently announced it would acquire West Virginia-based Key Centurion Bancshares in a transaction valued at about Dollars 536m, or Dollars 22 a share. Key Centurion has Dollars 3bn in total assets. That announcement came on the heels of news in April that Banc One was acquiring Valley National Bank of Arizona in a Dollars 1.2bn stock deal. Under the leadership of Mr McCoy, Banc One has been concentrating on a conservative lending policy in the retail banking sector and has maintained a return on assets that is among the highest in US banking. Last year, Banc One bucked the national trend by turning in a 25 per cent increase in net profits, to Dollars 529.5m.</p>

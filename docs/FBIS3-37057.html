Viktor Chernomyrdin  issued this directive to the Russian Federation Finance Ministry  after this morning's meeting with coal-industry managers and  trade-union leaders.    Viktor Chernomyrdin also proposed that a study should be  made  of the idea of gradually paying off the debts to the coalminers  by means of bills of exchange that would be freely accepted for  encashment by the Russian Central Bank.</p>

			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / Finance and the Family: Fidelity withdraws from pensions - At a glance Fidelity Investments is to withdraw from personal pensions to concentrate on its core fund management activity. It will therefore no longer be offering Fidelity Select Personal Pensions unit trust. Arrangements have been made for Fidelity's pensions clients to transfer into a new personal pensions product with Professional Life. Pension clients will continue to be able to switch between Fidelity unit trusts and those who do not wish to transfer to Professional Life can transfer in the normal way to other pension providers.</p>

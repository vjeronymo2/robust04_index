			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / International Company News: Allied-Signal hit by car industry slump ALLIED-SIGNAL, the US industrial conglomerate, saw its first-quarter earnings halved as a result of weak markets in its core automotive, aerospace and engineered materials businesses. Net earnings tumbled to Dollars 63m, or 47 cents a share, from Dollars 129m, or 90 cents, a year earlier. Sales fell to Dollars 2.9bn from Dollars 3.1bn. Mr Edward Hennessy, chairman of the New Jersey-based company, said profits were hit by the slump in the North American motor industry, the cutback in commercial airline traffic (which reduced orders for aircraft spare parts), and weaker consumer demand, which affected sales of carpet fibre. The automotive division, whose products include brake systems, spark plugs, turbochargers and filters, slid to an Dollars 11m loss, from profits of Dollars 32m. Second-quarter profits will be significantly boosted, however, by the Dollars 476m sale of US offshore oil and gas operations owned by Union Texas Petroleum, in which Allied-Signal has a 39 per cent interest. The sale was finalised earlier this month.</p>

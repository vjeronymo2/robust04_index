			<p><P> December 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PALESTINIAN GROUP PROTESTS USE OF 'NAZI' LABEL  </P> <P> We are responding to the article concerning the Simon Wiesenthal Center's  national tribute dinner at the Century Plaza ("Honoring Those Who Remember,"  Nov. 21). Yitzhak Shamir, prime minister of Israel, gave the keynote speech  after awards were presented to those who work to preserve the Holocaust on film  and television. James Woods, one of the distinguished actors to receive an  award, is quoted as referring to protesters outside the hotel as "Nazis."  </P> <P> The Palestine Solidarity Committee is a group of Americans that has formed in  support of the Palestinian right to self-determination and to call for the end  of the Israeli occupation and its oppressive measures in the West Bank and  Gaza. As the organizers of the protest against Shamir's visit to Los Angeles,  we take strong exception to the remarks made by James Woods.  </P> <P> Woods' statement demonstrates an ignorance of who the protesters were, what  their concerns are, and reveals the misunderstanding of the nature of Israeli  policy in the Occupied Territories. There were several hundred people who  attended the demonstration representing a very broad coalition of American  peace activists, many from the Jewish community who abhor the policies of the  Shamir government. The PSC is particularly indebted to members of the  Salvadoran solidarity groups who, working overtime, gave a strong show of  support at the demonstration for the Palestinian plight.  </P> <P> LYCETTE IRVING, Palestine Solidarity Committee, Los Angeles  </P></p>

Among the objectives are pushing ahead with the development  of Haicang, a district set aside for Taiwan investors,  implementing some special policies for free ports and increasing  industrial output.    As a pilot reform zone, Xiamen has developed an  overseas-oriented economy, with manufacturing industries as  mainstay.    According to the blueprint, Haichang will be constructed  into  a multi-functional area with urban districts, petrochemical  plants and harbor.    Technology is being updated in engineering machinery, rubber  and pharmaceutical industries. Motorcycles, audio components,  containers and glasses, all newly-launched projects, will go  into production within the year.</p>

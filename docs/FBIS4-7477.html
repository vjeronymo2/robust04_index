			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Szonda Ipsos's Public Opinion Survey </F> Commissioned by MAGYAR HIRLAP -- What Kind of Government  Coalition Are People Expecting?"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Party leaders keep making  statements about which parties and under what conditions they  would take on the responsibility of joint governing. The  coalition variations based on these statements are very diverse.  However, if we also consider the election prospects, the  possible coalition setups that can actually become a reality  after the elections can be drawn up fairly accurately, as can  the parties that are most likely to become government-forming  factors. It seems that this is the Hungarian Socialist Party  [MSZP] because, according to the public, the MSZP is clear  favorite for the elections. This can be seen from the public  opinion survey that was carried out by the Szonda Ipsos [public  opinion research company], commissioned by MAGYAR HIRLAP, in  recent weeks. Some of the findings appear in this article, the  rest -- on what kind of coalition people would welcome -- will  be published later. The national representative survey was done  in the first half of March and was based on a sample of 937  people. [passage omitted]    As for the outcome of the elections, people give the biggest  chance to the MSZP. To the question "Which party do you think  will receive the greatest number of votes at the May elections?"  40 percent placed the Socialists in first place. A relatively  large number think that the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ]  and the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] also have a chance of  final victory (18 and 17 percent), a little over a sixth  assuming that they can win the elections. Far fewer people  think the same of the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz] and  the Independent Smallholders Party [FKGP] (10 and 7 percent),  and the Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP] is even more  insignificant in this respect. [passage omitted]    According to our data, in the current situation, those  questioned -- at least those prepared to give their views on  this issue -- see the greatest chance to be for a coalition  involving the MSZP and the SZDSZ, or a government coalition of  the three major opposition parties. Some 20 percent of those  who replied thought it most likely that the MSZP and the SZDSZ  would form a government, and 14 percent saw a serious chance for  this although they were less certain. A similar number of  people predicted that the MSZP would accept a role in government  together with the SZDSZ and the Fidesz (19 percent), and the  same number thought that a joint action of the three parties had  less chance (18 percent) than other permutations but was still  significant.    The chances of the opposition parties winning the elections  and forming a government is also increased by the fact that the  third most frequently mentioned variation is a coalition of the  two liberal parties, namely the SZDSZ and the Fidesz: 12  percent of people mentioned this coalition possibility in first  place and 11 percent in second.    The public gives much less chance to a coalition involving  only the current government parties: For example, few think the  survival of the current coalition likely (first place: 11  percent, second place: 7 percent). Those questioned also give  less chance to a mixed coalition of some of the current  government and opposition parties. Some mentioned a setup with  the SZDSZ and the Fidesz together with a government party,  either the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] (10 and 7 percent)  or the KDNP (9 and 7 percent respectively). The basis of a  coalition in which the MDF could also participate (8 and 8  percent) along with the three opposition parties would also be  the opposition parties. The MDF also appears as a  government-forming factor with the Fidesz and the KDNP (7 and 7  percent). Of the coalition possibilities, respondents thought  an SZDSZ-MSZP-KDNP coalition least likely (5 and 8 percent).    It is also worth mentioning briefly which coalition setup  out  of those examined is favored by the possible outcome of the  elections -- namely which party the public thinks likely to win  in May. As has already been mentioned, most people expect the  MSZP to win the elections. If this happens then, according to  the respondents, the MSZP may be expected to invite the SZDSZ to  be a coalition partner, but far fewer think that the MSZP will  also be forced to involve the Fidesz. Those questioned can  think of many coalitions involving the MSZP, but in a  significant number of cases they mentioned a government  coalition without the MSZP, even though they predicted a MSZP  victory. This fact in itself could indicate that, according to  some respondents, the MSZP will not be able to form a government  in spite of a successful result. It is true, though, that this  possibility -- that the winning position is not always linked to  a possible role in government -- can be observed in the case of  all "winning" parties albeit to a varying extent.</p>

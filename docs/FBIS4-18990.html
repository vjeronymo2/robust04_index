This indifference is covered up by the  systematic `conspiracy of silence' which has condemned our  national issue to oblivion and our North Epirote brothers into  fatalism.    ``In our desire to suppress this disastrous spirit about the  land of North Epirus, we have proceeded with the reconstitution  of the heroic MAVI (North Epirus Liberation Front) and we have  struck against a fully armed Albanian border guard post....''

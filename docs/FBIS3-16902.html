The pickets that are held now are a form of struggle against  a colonial empire, said Juri Adams, deputy leader of the  Estonian National Independence Party faction in the parliament.    MP [member of parliament] K. Jaak Roosaare called on the  Russian military to come out of the house and speak before the  picketers. The Estonian MP's appeal met with no response,  however.    The Estonian National Independence Party has said the Monday  pickets in front of the house that is situated just on the foot  of the Toompea Hill, some 200 meters from the residence of the  Estonian Government and the parliament, will continue until the  last Russian soldier has left the country.</p>

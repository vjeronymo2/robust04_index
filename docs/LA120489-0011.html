			<p><P> December 4, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSINESS AFTER MALTA  </P> <P> Except for the weather, which was the stormiest to bang at Malta in a decade,  this was the No Surprise Summit. Yet rarely has the very lack of surprise  prompted more applause. The world, and certainly both superpowers, wanted a  summit meeting that had "business as usual" stamped all over it; people wanted  the two superpower leaders to get to work in a calm businesslike fashion. No  megaproposals out of left, or even right, field, please. Just make the world a  better, safer place, thank you very much. And that's precisely what President  Bush and Soviet President Gorbachev appear to be purposefully striding towards.  </P> <P> Not only can the two leaders do business with each other, there's evidence that  the business volume is to be increased dramatically. A full-fledged nuclear  arms control summit is on tap for June. Negotiations to reduce conventional  forces in Europe will speed up. The extraordinary complexities of an agreement  to ban chemical weapons will be attacked. This move on chemical warfare  represents a major and highly commendable concession by Bush.  </P> <P> The U.S. also promised to help Moscow obtain its longtime goal of observer  status at GATT (the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs) -- yet another  switch in Administration policy. It's true that the superpower leaders failed  to make any progress on the contentious issues of naval arms control and Soviet  involvement in Central America, but in the now-patented cool-cucumber ah-shucks  Bush style they low-keyed this whole business as best they could.  </P> <P> The eyeball-to-eyeball chemistry between the leaders was evident in their joint  press conference -- as if two CEOs were discoursing calmly about the  possibility of a business upturn. It is devoutly to be wished that this  superpower chemistry is bankable and that both sides will be able to draw on it  in the months to come. The rapidly evolving events in Eastern Europe and  elsewhere continue to astonish. The two leaders apparently agreed not to try to  micromanage the German situation but to leave it to history, as it were. Lots  of luck, there. Just yesterday East German leader Egon Krenz and the entire  Communist party leadership resigned, leaving the fate of that country to an  interim panel of reformers -- and, one supposes, "history." But history is not  always efficient, nor does it always produce results that the world is  comfortable with -- much like the weather in normally pacific Malta.  </P></p>

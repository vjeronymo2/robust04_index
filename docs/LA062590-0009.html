			<p><P> June 25, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INTERPRETING THE BILL OF RIGHTS  </P> <P> Ron Ekard is ready to declare the Second Amendment null and void (letter, June  20) because "none of today's guns are covered by the Second Amendment." He  should use more care in interpreting the Constitution.  </P> <P> Consider the many other things that did not exist "in those days": radio,  television, photography, xerography, records, tapes, compact disks to name a  few. Yet, First Amendment protection has been readily extended to all of these.  Is Ekard ready to foreclose protection for these on the unconvincing grounds  that they were not around when the Constitution was written? Or do we rally  around the Bill of Rights only for non-Second Amendment causes?  </P> <P> I am concerned over the growing number of gun-related crimes, but I would hope  our response might be a bit more creative than the narrow interpretation  suggested by Ekard.  </P> <P> WILLIAM S. LaSOR JR.  </P> <P> Corona del Mar  </P></p>

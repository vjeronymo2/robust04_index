			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Congressman Andrews expressed concern that any rule that would prohibit marketing of a tour until tickets are in hand would not be practical, since tickets for many events are not available until a couple of weeks in advance but other arrangements (e.g., air and hotel) must be made before that. However, neither the existing nor proposed rules requires that tickets be in hand before marketing is allowed; the operator can simply have a written contract for the tickets.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rule also incorporated the so-called ``booking rejection'' and ``contingent booking'' procedures currently found in section 380.31(c) of the Super Bowl charter rule, and expanded them to apply to all events and to all forms of air transportation. These provisions require operators to return unsolicited bookings for which they don't have event tickets unless a tour participant authorizes the operator in writing to retain the participant's payment while the operator attempts to obtain more event tickets. We are modifying this slightly to allow for situations in which participants agree to take the tour without an event ticket; the operator would be required to obtain the participant's written acknowledgment of this understanding.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One of the key provisions of the Super Bowl charter rule is the requirement for the operator to refund the total tour price to any participant who does not receive a promised game ticket, even if the participant uses all of the other tour features. The ANPRM tentatively proposed to incorporate this provision in the new rule, but also asked for comment on whether the rule should contain only the ``booking rejection'' and ``contingent booking'' procedures without the ``money back guarantee.'' However, the comments solidly supported the ``money back guarantee,'' and we incorporated it in the proposed rule. We stated that we agreed with the Football Bowl Association that strong consumer remedies will also have the effect of deterring the promotion of non-legitimate tour packages.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In its comments on the ANPRM, NACA stated that there should be an exception to the ``money back guarantee'' for situations of force majeure and acts of God, such as the earthquake in San Francisco that caused postponement of the World Series several years ago. The NHL suggested that if the event is canceled or substantially altered, participants should be entitled only to a refund of the face value of the event, not the total tour price. We replied in the NPRM that it was never our intent to make the tour operator the guarantor of the event itself. The ``money back guarantee'' in the existing Super Bowl charter rule kicks in ``if game tickets are not supplied.'' The rule we proposed in October would require refunds ``*&blank;*&blank;* if promised admission to the [event] is not furnished by the tour operator *&blank;*&blank;*'' These provisions are directed toward potential problems with ticket distribution, not with the event itself. If people who have tickets are able to attend the event and Special Event Tour participants are shut out because they don't have tickets, the ``money back guarantee'' would apply. On the other hand, if nobody with a ticket can use it during the period of the tour because the event itself was canceled or postponed, the ``money back guarantee'' would not apply.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We stated in the NPRM that we wished to make it clear that we are talking only about problems with the event itself, not about any or all problems that the tour operator might view as beyond its control. Failure of a ticket broker to deliver tickets to the tour operator, we said, would not invalidate the ``money back guarantee.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the NPRM we stated that we agreed with the NHL that if the event is canceled consumers should receive a refund for the portion of their tour price that applied to the event that they paid for but did not receive. However, we said, mandating such a partial refund in a situation where the event itself did not take place and where there were no problems with ticket distribution was beyond the scope of this proceeding, and would best be dealt with in the context of contract law or other applicable existing law.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] Klaus Kinkel [FRG foreign  minister] stated at the new conference [after the Geneva talks  on Bosnia-Herzegovina] that "the tragedy" in Bosnia, with the  killing, rapes, and the devastation of the country, is  unfortunately still continuing. Although progress has recently  been made -- for example, the settlements for Sarajevo and  Gorazde and those for a Croat-Bosniak federation -- the  situation is still "fragile."    Both Kinkel and [French Foreign Minister] Juppe stressed  that  many obstacles still have to be eliminated on the road to a  peaceful solution. Before German journalists, Kinkel was  reserved in his evaluation of the results of the negotiations.  "I do not want to be seized with false euphoria, we have so  often been disappointed." After his talks with President Yeltsin  and [Russian Foreign Minister] Kozyrev, he hopes for Russian  pressure.    Referring to the lifting of the arms embargo for the  Muslims'  benefit, which is recommended by the U.S. Senate, Kinkel said  that "10 of the 12 states of the European Union [EU] have  problems with the lifting of the arms embargo." Moreover, in  the UN Security Council, Great Britain and France would vote  against it. On Friday evening, Kinkel also met with Croatian  Foreign Minister Mate Granic in Geneva. [passage omitted]    While the agreement that was negotiated between Croats and  Muslims and centrally handled by the Americans in Vienna  apparently started from 50 percent for these two groups, the  circle of ministers in Geneva agreed on a ratio of 51 percent  for the federation to 49 percent for the Serbs. Thus, it  accepted the ratio that was put forward by the European Union as  early as at the end of last year. [passage omitted]</p>

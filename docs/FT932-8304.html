			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Survey of Courier and Express Services (2): The whole world's in their hands - Shippers have global aims MULTINATIONAL manufacturers and suppliers are increasingly demanding express services which can distribute their goods worldwide with a standard level of delivery performance. Fuelling that demand is the now well-established trend for manufacturers to reduce stocks or inventories and produce goods much closer to order. Confirming those points, a recent World Bank survey of 1,000 global shippers showed companies expected their frequency of annual inventory turnover to rise 60 per cent between in the 10 years to 1996. Order cycle times were expected to drop 40 per cent over the same period, with certain sectors of industry showing even greater changes. Some electronics companies, for example, have already reduced their average order cycle time from 23 weeks to five weeks over the last 10 years. By 1995, the average order cycle time for the industry is forecast to be down to less than two weeks. Such dramatic changes have important implications for the international express industry. 'As global shippers reduce their inventories and turn those inventories more frequently, they also demand shorter order fulfilment times from their suppliers and quicker delivery commitments from their transportation companies,' commented Mr Charles Malone, Federal Express vice-president sales in Hong Kong at last month's Air Freight Asia '93 conference in Sapporo, Japan. The problem for the express companies and their competitors is that in order to meet those demands properly, they need global service networks. Developing that coverage is so costly that only a small number of operators can genuinely claim to run worldwide delivery networks. Even those companies are now in many cases increasingly developing alliances and partnerships to help sustain such operations. In line with that trend, Mr John Mullen, chief executive officer of TNT Express Worldwide, believes that in spite of the recent relative calm in the world express industry after a spate of joint ventures and amalgamations, further changes are in the pipeline. 'Rationalisation is by no means over yet. I believe there will be a number of changes on a global scale. There will be more capacity-sharing and better utilisation of assets in the industry, particularly on a regional basis,' he says. TNT itself provides a good example of those trends in action, having formed a joint venture international express company with GD Net, an organisation established by the post offices of Germany, France, the Netherlands, Sweden and Canada, some 18 months ago. Further support for the idea of joint ventures and alliances comes from Mr Klaus-Michael Kuehne, chairman and chief executive of Swiss-based global freight forwarder Kuehne &amp; Nagel. He says that when studying which markets to serve, forwarders and express companies have to decide whether they can do it on their own, irrespective of the enormous investments required for that kind of venture, or combine the strength and synergies of different service providers in new forms of co-operation. 'One option could be strategic alliances with chosen competitors with clearly defined activities in the field of specific market distribution,' he told last year's World Express &amp; Mail Conference in Munich, Germany. 'Another option could be a joint venture forwarder and a cargo-minded airline, with a selected number of competitors or a combination of both, to become a key player in express activities.' The most substantial example of co-operation between airlines and express companies, or integrators as they are sometimes known, involves DHL Worldwide Express. It is developing increasingly close links with German airline Lufthansa and Japanese carrier Japan Air Lines which now each hold a 25 per cent stake in the courier/air express company. As part of the same development, Japanese trading house Nissho Iwai has built up a 7.5 per cent stake. Mr Patrick Lupo, the Brussels-based chairman and chief executive officer for DHL International, claims the company's alliance with Lufthansa, JAL and Nissho Iwai 'significantly strengthens our uplift and long haul capabilities and enhances our airport handling capacity throughout the world'. Customers, he adds, get access to a much broader menu of services. Current examples of co-operation between DHL and Lufthansa include activities at the air express company's recently-established Nordic area hub in Copenhagen, Denmark. DHL has become the anchor tenant, with around 40 per cent of the accommodation, in a new facility developed by a consortium including the German airline. In a similar vein, DHL plans to become a major tenant of JAL's new cargo facility at JFK Airport, New York. JAL is currently investing something like Dollars 100m in what was a former Pan American cargo terminal to make it one of the most advanced facilities in the world. DHL is co-operating with both JAL and Lufthansa by using its own regional hub and spoke distribution systems in markets such as the US for the onward movement to final destination of freight carried on the two airlines' longhaul aircraft. Leading forwarders, too, are looking to establish closer relationships with airlines in a bid to compete with the express specialists. But, warns Mr Kuehne, co-operation between airlines and forwarders needs to be improved if such moves are to succeed. The traditional role of the forwarder as an agent of the carrier, fulfilling a kind of sub-contractor function, is no longer sufficient, he argues. 'In future, you will have to offer the best possible service as one product. And that should be a joint product of the airline and the forwarder. It should be developed jointly and offered jointly,' he says. Rather more controversial is the idea that express companies and traditional freight forwarding agents could also benefit from working together on a global basis. Mr Malone of Federal Express said some industry leaders were convinced that agents and integrators would only realise their growth potential by working together as a team to serve global shippers. But there were many others in the industry who did not share that view. 'Some agents feel the integrators are trying to put them out of business, that the integrators are disrupting agents' plans to expand their control and influence on the shippers. Integrators, on the other hand, have invested millions of dollars in service networks to meet new shippers' demands and feel this segment of the business is fair game,' he said. Federal Express, claimed Mr Malone, felt the answer lay somewhere between those different views and that the global shipper could be best served when agents and integrators worked as a service team. But he admitted forging such alliances would not be easy.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Kyoto, April 20 KYODO -- Delegates to an  international Antarctica meeting under way in Kyoto basically  agreed Wednesday [20 April] on a set of guidelines for visitors  to the South Pole to protect its "unique and pristine"  environment.    The regulations proposed by Britain and Australia urge  tourists, explorers and travel agencies to control their own  activities to protect the wildlife and environment of the  continent.    They will be formally adopted during the conference's final  sessions Thursday and Friday.    "Do not feed, touch, or handle birds or seals," "do not  damage plants," and "do not use guns or explosives," are among  the draft's guidelines urging visitors to refrain from  activities that disturb the Antarctic flora and fauna.    Tourists and adventurers are also asked to respect protected  areas, to stay away from research facilities and study sites,  not to dispose waste or collect rocks and fossils as souvenirs,  and to plan their trips sensibly.    The draft obligates tour organizers to notify national  authorities about planned activities, assess and monitor the  environmental impact of their expeditions and employ experienced  and trained guides.    Travel agents must inform tour participants about the  requirements of the 1959 Antarctic treaty and its follow-up  provisions and educate them about proper behavior in Antarctica.    Delegates could not reach a consensus on how the guidelines  should be implemented by national governments but decided to  discuss national solutions at the coming Antarctica conference  in South Korea next year.    Restrictions on tourism have become a hot potato among  treaty  signatories since the adoption of the protocol on environmental  protection to the Antarctic treaty in 1991.    Countries like the United States and Britain, from where  many  tourists visit the area, were opposed to tough regulations  involving liability for environmental damage as proposed by  France and Chile.    A major success of the Kyoto conference is that delegates  reached an agreement on the tourism issue at all. However, a  Japanese delegate decried that the guidelines were watered down  to minimum requirements.    "Their content is characterized by the thinking `let's start  from the common ground for the time being,'" the delegate said.    A U.S. delegate said the need for such guidelines on the  other hand shows "how close the South Pole has moved to us."    About 250 delegates from some 40 countries, international  organizations and nongovernmental groups are attending the  meeting which started April 11 and runs through Friday.    About 7,000 tourists including some 100 Japanese visit the  South Pole each year, but there have been reports of the  tourists trampling penguin nesting grounds, damaging local plant  life and disrupting scientific experiments being conducted in  the area.</p>

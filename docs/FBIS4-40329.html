Petru Harbur, head of the Chisinau Police  Commissariat, stated to BASA that the main purpose of the  operation is to stabilize the crime situation in Chisinau.  According to him, there was a slight increase in the level of  crime in the first quarter of 1994. Measures are undertaken to  detect illegally held arms, criminals from the other regions of  the CIS who have settled in Chisinau, cases of violation of  passport regulations and raids on the usual criminal  hang-outs-bars, casinos and restaurants. According to Harbur,  the first two days of the operation resulted in a two fold  decrease in the number of crimes. The police has detained four  persons wanted by police and discovered illegally held arms. He  said that forecasts about the efficiency of the operation are  thus confirmed.</p>

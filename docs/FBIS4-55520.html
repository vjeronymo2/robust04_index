			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by P.Re.: "Hunger Strike Ends"] </F>   [Text] Tirana -- The hunger strike in Kukes, an event  whose drama shocked the entire country at the end of last week,  has ended. After a meeting with a delegation of the strikers  lasting many hours, the government has promised to meet most of  the demands so strongly put forward by many inhabitants of the  villages of Kukes.    Finally, after many days of bargaining, the government's  representatives and the strikers whose land had been inundated  succeeded in finding a common language. This was confirmed to  journalists on 12 May by the chairman of the strikers'  delegation, chosen unanimously the day before at the joint  meeting of the strikers holed up in the local government  building and the Lake of Fierze Association of the Flooded Out.  "We are now sort of satisfied," the strike chairman said as he  emerged from his meeting with Prime Minister Meksi, "because  our main demands were met." He also expressed confidence that  the government's latest promises would also lead others to give  up their hunger strike.    The government has agreed to quickly implement various  measures designed to ease the burden of poverty under which  these areas labor. The peasants of Kukes have first been  promised compensation with land or in cash for their land  inundated by the Lake of Fierze. These people will also benefit  from long-term loans for house-building and preferential loans  for the development of private agriculture. For those  inhabitants who even after these measures will still find it  difficult to live on their small areas of infertile land, the  government has undertaken to organize emigration to more  prosperous areas of the country where there is still free state  land. Specialists will review once again social welfare for the  inhabitants of Kukes. One of the measures promised by the  government has been an increase in the level of social support  for these people. Kukes will also be given preference in the  distribution of humanitarian aid and other forms of assistance.    The government's representatives failed to agree to only two  of the demands included in the strike program: co-ownership of  the Fierze hydroelectric station and the payment of rent for the  inundated land.</p>

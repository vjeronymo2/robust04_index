			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cotton trade to lobby against export bans International cotton traders will travel to India and Pakistan next week to try to persuade the governments of those countries to lift export embargoes on cotton shipments. The Indian government suspended shipments on Tuesday following shortfalls in domestic production. The cotton that is being held up by the export ban had been sold by tender to international traders. Those trading companies say they will now have to turn to the world spot market for higher-priced supplies to fulfil their own contractual obligations. World cotton prices have risen sharply in recent weeks in response to news that production in China, the US, India and Pakistan - the world's biggest cotton growers - would be affected by bad weather and disease. Prices on the New York Cotton Exchange increased from about 50 cents a pound last September to 76 cents yesterday. The US Department of Agriculture estimates that this year's world crop will fall by 2.5m bales from 1992-1993's 82.8m bales. 'The action of the Indian government is so short-sighted when it has spent so long building it's reputation as a reliable source of cotton,' said Mr Colin Bernhardt, chairman of Liverpool-based cotton traders Ralli Brothers &amp; Coney. The Indians are holding back 200,000 bales - equal to about a week's consumption by domestic mills. This is a tiny fraction of the overall world cotton trade, which accounts for 23m bales, but the World Cotton Exporters Association - a group of international traders - is concerned about the precedent the move will set. The Turkish government slapped on high export sales taxes on cotton last month in an effort to hold back shipments. But after protests from the European Union, Turkey agreed to suspend the tax on cotton contracted for export prior to its imposition.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Christa Friedl: "Zeolite Cools and Heats </F> Economically and in an Environment-Friendly Manner"]    [Text] VDI-N,Duesseldorf, 6 May 94 - Whenever cooling  is generated, waste heat occurs. A new process, developed by the  Zeo-Tech Company in Bavaria, utilizes the waste heat to generate  hot water simultaneously with the cold in the refrigerator. All  of this is accomplished without the use of  environment-threatening CFC's (chlorofluorocarbons), FHC's  (fluorinated hydrocarbons, or hydrocarbons.    The Joern Schwarz stand at the Hannover Fair simply  displayed  cold beer and hot water. At first glance, that in itself  constituted nothing particularly unusual at this year's Fair.  What is extremely unusual, however, is the way the main  developer at the Zeo-Tech Company in Unterscheissheim, Bavaria,  cools the beer and heats the water. Both are effected with water  vapor and 12 kg of sand.    Schwarz relies on a simple technical principle, namely, that  highly porous materials--in this case, a sand-like zeolite that  occurs naturally and which for a long time has also been used as  a substitute for phosphates in detergents--at a negative  pressure voraciously sucks up the water evaporating from a water  surface. In the process, the minerals develop heat, while the  water, owing to the evaporation, is cooled and eventually  frozen. Some zeolites can--without replacement--sop up water as  often as needed and then release it again. In this process, a  cold circulation is generated.    "Private households use 25% of the primary energy  expended  in Germany annually to produce heat and cold," Schwarz points  out. Usually, this is done in separate processes as a result of  which a considerable amount of power is lost. What could be more  desirable than to have the cold and the heat generation linked  together?    The successful result of this endeavor is the "cool-boiler,"  a combined apparatus consisting of an electrical hot water  generator and a refrigerator. The bottom line here is that only  the boiler consumes power. "The operation of the refrigerator  comes gratis," Schwarz is pleased to say.    It was not a simple matter to convert the theoretical  physical principles into a practical system however. It cost the  researchers at the Zeo-Tech Company about three years in R&amp;D  time before they could build the first successful prototype.  This method of discontinuous energy conversion procedes in two  phases. The first phase lasts only as long as it takes for the  zeolite to become saturated with water. Then, in the second  phase, a reverse procedure is effected through the introduction  of heat. The water is forced out of the zeolite in the form of  water vapor, is then liquified in a condensor, and then, in the  next step, can via a collecting main be sucked up again in the  evaporator.    For the operation of the cool-boiler, the two evacuated  zeolite containers (weight filled of each is six kg) are  alternately heated, thereby forcing the adsorbed water out  (desorber). For the prototype, the required electrical power was  about 1 KW. The water vapor releases its heat in the condensor,  after which it is transferred to the boiler water through the  casing wall. The water flows through a line into the  refrigerator's evaporator. There, the other zeolite container  can suck up the water vapor that is generated. In this way, the  heat required for the evaporation process is drawn out of the  inside of the refrigerator. During the process, the zeolite is  heated to 150C, sending this heat to the boiler water via a  heat-exchanger. The process continues until one adsorber is  saturated with water and the other has its water removed. "Using  twelve kilos of zeolite, the process lasts two to three days,"  Schwarz notes. Then the adsorber and desorber exchange roles.  This technique can generate up to -20C in the refrigerator,  and 90C in the boiler. The system is regulated by an ESP  control system. When the temperature gets too high, a  temperature sensor in the refrigerator sends a pulse signal to  the vacuum pump which again activates the adsorption process.    One of the hard nuts to crack in the development of this  technique was the evaporator. Decisive in its functioning is a  fiber in which the water can rise and which offers a large  surface area. No less important is the requirement that the  fiber not be destroyed or damaged by the formation of ice  crystals. The Zeo-Tech developers had a stroke of luck and  chance in this matter. A fiber glass material is used in the  prototype that easily withstands the countless evaporation and  cooling processes.    Schwarz and his team of researchers is now working on the  further development of the control and regulating technology and  on optimizing the zeolite system. The refrigeration technicians  expect better energy utilization through the use of aluminum  heat exchangers that are dip-coated in zeolite powder with  ceramic glue. Schwarz still cannot provide precise data on the  system's power balance. It is to be ascertained in the coming  months.    In any case, this year's Fair brought the refrigeration  technicians an unexpected success. A "white goods" [linen]  manufacturer in Saxony expressed interest in a cooperative  venture. The first cool-boiler system could appear on the market  as early as 1996.  <H5>  Photo Captions </H5>   1. p. 27 (upper left): Heat and cold can be generated at  lower cost and in an environmentally friendly manner by coupling  the refrigerator and the hot water boiler.

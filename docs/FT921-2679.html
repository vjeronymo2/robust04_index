			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Fresh plea by Dunkel for early end to talks MR Arthur Dunkel, Gatt director-general, yesterday launched a fresh appeal for an early and successful end to the Uruguay Round of trade talks, Frances Williams reports from Geneva. The delay in completing the talks, more than a year over schedule, was worsening the international economic environment and threatening the reform programmes of many developing and former communist economies, he said. Introducing his annual report to Gatt's governing council, Mr Dunkel said a liberal and credible trading system played a pivotal role in promoting development. Economic growth was being delayed by lack of confidence on the part of producers, investors, traders and consumers. Only modest recovery was in prospect in the years ahead. 'What we need, and urgently, is a significant boost to economic growth to generate the investment flows, jobs and technology transfers and increased earnings from trade without which the dramatic reform programmes under way in many countries cannot be sustained,' Mr Dunkel said. He urged Gatt members to seize the 'window of opportunity' to end the Uruguay Round within weeks. The 108 countries taking part in the round aim for a final package of accords by Easter, but this deadline seems unlikely to be met. Mr Dunkel said the Round was crucial for Gatt's existing members and more than 20 potential members.</p>

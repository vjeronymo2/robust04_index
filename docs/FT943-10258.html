			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / EU set for clash on Gatt ratification The European Union's smaller member states look set for a clash with the bigger ones over the basis on which the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade's Uruguay Round trade liberalisation accord is ratified. The row centres on whether the European Commission should persist with its request to the European Court of Justice for an opinion on where legal competences lie in matters covered by Gatt. The court has been asked to clarify those areas where competence lies with the Commission and those where it rests with the member states, and to identify any grey areas. It is expected to give its views towards the end of the year, which would not leave much time for ratification of the accord before the deadline of January 1 for establishment of the World Trade Organisation, Gatt's successor. The Commission has said it is willing to consider a code of conduct for member states, which might act as an alternative to the opinion of the court, in order to meet this deadline. 'There is a possibility that the US will ratify on time and that the Japanese will do so too. It would be unfortunate if they got there on time and the Community didn't,' said a senior Commission official yesterday. However, smaller countries are insisting it would be foolish to proceed with ratification, even under the aegis of a code of conduct, without a proper legal basis provided by the European court. The Belgian government has said that if the Commission withdraws its request for advice from the court, it would itself seek an opinion. The split between the countries is reflected in an apparent division within the Commission over what the position of Europe's executive body should be. Some commission sources suspect the Union's more powerful members - notably France, Germany and the UK - are trying to persuade the Commission to withdraw its proceedings in the court, as they fear the judges will attribute trade competences to the Commission rather than to the member states. This would come at a time when all three countries are becoming wary of integrationist tendencies. Other Commission sources say Brussels is waiting until September to see what the German presidency produces as a proposed code of conduct. 'The reality is that unless they produce something worthwhile, we will not consider dropping the court case,' said a Commission official. 'If on the other hand they come up with something that is acceptable to the Commission, then we will withdraw.' The other problem is that the Council of Ministers has not yet responded to the European Parliament's request for the text of the Gatt agreement so that it may begin work on ratification. The Commission has proposed proceeding under Article 228 of the Maastricht treaty, which gives the parliament the power to say yes or no to ratification. The council is unhappy with this proposal, but has yet to decide on which legal basis to proceed with the parliament.</p>

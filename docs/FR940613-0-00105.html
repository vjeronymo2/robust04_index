A nine-axle combination vehicle may not exceed a total maximum gross weight of 143,000 pounds. An eight-axle combination vehicle may not exceed a total maximum gross weight of 138,400 pounds. The maximum gross weight that may be carried upon any combination of units is limited by the maximum gross weight that can be carried upon the axles as follows. For a nine-axle combination: Drive axles_36,000 pounds, axles four/five_36,000 pounds, axles six/seven_27,000 pounds, and axles eight/nine_36,000 pounds. A minimum 12-foot axle spacing between the fifth and sixth axles is also required on the nine-axle LCV. For an eight-axle combination: Drive axles_36,000 pounds, axles four/five_36,000 pounds, sixth axle_22,400 pounds, and axles seven/eight_36,000 pounds. The eight-axle LCV has no minimum axle-spacing requirements. For gross weights in excess of 138,400 pounds the combination must include a tandem-axle dolly to meet the nine-axle requirements. Maximum permissible gross weight for B-train combination is 127,000 pounds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> When the gross weight of the two trailers in a tandem combination vary more than 20 percent, the heaviest of the two must be placed in the lead position.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For tandem trailer combinations in which neither trailing unit exceeds 28.5 feet in length the following maximum allowable weights apply: for a single axle_28,000 pounds (except that steering axles may not exceed 22,400 pounds), for a tandem axle_42,500 pounds, for a tri-axle_52,500 pounds.

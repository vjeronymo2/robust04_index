			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / Embattled franc fort ready to pull up the drawbridge: Without a common monetary system, there is no Europe. That is French policy. John Ridding and David Buchan on the fight to keep the franc strong IS France ready, in the midst of recession, to raise interest rates to defend the franc, if joint declarations and interventions by French and German politicians and central bankers fail to stem the currency's slide against the D-Mark? This is the question underlying the plight of the franc. On Monday it dropped to below FFr3.41 to the D-Mark, or within two centimes of its floor in the European exchange rate mechanism, although it steadied yesterday. In its first three months, the Balladur government has had all its own way. Since early April, French official rates have been cut nine times, while the Bundesbank has only lowered German rates twice. 'The Bank of France has cut its intervention rate from 9.1 to 6.75 per cent since April while keeping the franc stable, said Mr Piers Butler of Baring Securities in Paris yesterday. 'Now we are seeing the turnaround.' In 1991 and 1992 France repeatedly showed itself ready to raise rates when necessary. But times are different now. The country is in recession and unemployment rising. Indeed the main catalyst of the latest wave of franc selling - apart from a general rebound in market sentiment about the D-Mark  -appeared to be last Thursday's forecast by Insee, France's national statistics institute. It was gloomier than the government in estimating that France's gross domestic product would contract by 0.7 per cent this year while its jobless rate would hit 12.5 per cent by December. The sight of a government increasingly constrained from raising rates by domestic political and economic factors precisely at the moment when it might need to do so for external monetary reasons, is always an enticing prospect for speculators, as Britain found to its cost last autumn. In retrospect, it is clear that Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister, was guilty of a bit of hubris on June 24 when he proudly said: 'The franc is performing well, perhaps better than the D-Mark.' After the French minister went on to make it appear that he was summoning his German opposite number, Mr Theo Waigel, and Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, to Paris for a discussion of 'concerted' interest rate cuts, Mr Waigel pleaded pressing business and stayed home. In the event, no lasting harm was done. The Franco-German economic council meeting has been rescheduled for early August, and co-operation between the two central banks seems as close as ever. Addressing a joint press conference in Basle on Monday with his French counterpart, Mr Jacques de Larosiere, Mr Schlesinger called the franc's problems 'temporary', and said that the Bundesbank's co-operation with the Bank of France 'is as close as it has ever been'. Much of the franc's 'temporary' problem is due to the revival of the D-Mark. Investors, having taken short positions on the German currency in June following a series of pessimistic economic forecasts and warnings from Mr George Soros, the influential currency trader, that the D-Mark was overvalued, have hurried back to the German bond market. 'We have seen a huge shift from French to German bonds,' said Mr Alain Galibert, economist at SG Warburg in Paris. 'Investors felt they were underweight in the D-Mark. They are responding to attractive German bond prices and to improved economic news from Germany.' But many of the fundamentals of the French economy remain very sound, particularly in relation to Germany. France's retail inflation dropped in June to an annual rate of 1.9 per cent. Its superior wage discipline has given it a 15 per cent competitive edge in terms of hourly wage costs over Germany in the past five years. It recorded a FFr16.2bn (Pounds 1.85bn) trade surplus in the first quarter of this year, and is set to retain its current account surplus in 1993. But the flip side of many of these achievements is recession, which has depressed industrial prices, wages and imports. Prime Minister Edouard Balladur is beginning to press on the fiscal accelerator, and promises generalised tax cuts in the autumn. But these would only take effect next year. Despite increased spending already on public works and housing, the French construction industry is still forecasting a 4 per cent decline in activity this year. In these circumstances, the last thing the government wants to do is raise interest rates, whose recent reduction is also considered essential to giving the stock market a lift before the sell-off of state companies starts in the autumn. Mr Balladur has had a considerable stroke of luck in that the trouble for the franc only began just before subscriptions to his very successful bond issue closed last Friday. Some 1.4m French bought FFr110bn of the four-year Balladur bonds carrying a 6 per cent coupon, presumably calculating with the recent interest rate decline they could not get a much better return elsewhere. Having got their money, Mr Balladur could now raise interest rates, if he had to. If that happened, some investors might cry foul. But there is no mistaking the determination of the French political establishment to keep the franc locked to the D-Mark. Mr Balladur himself said this week that he would resign rather than devalue. 'If anyone wanted to carry out another policy' of devaluation, protectionism, increasing the budget deficit, 'they would first have to change prime minister,' he said. Some backbenchers in Mr Balladur's RPR Gaullist party and the odd maverick within the UDF, its coalition partner, are restive with Mr Balladur's strong money stance. But no one of any import is pressing him to change. Least of all, the president. On nominating Mr Balladur, Mr Mitterrand called for the preservation of the European monetary system, saying that 'keeping the franc's parity with the D-Mark is a precondition of this. Without a common monetary system, there is no Europe'. That is French policy.</p>

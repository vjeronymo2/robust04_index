			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Berlusconi may break promise on taxes Italy's Berlusconi government indicated yesterday that it would be prepared to break a campaign promise and raise taxes to cope with a constitutional court decision ordering the payment of L30,000bn (Pounds 12.3bn) in pension arrears. In advance of a cabinet meeting late yesterday, officials said the government would adopt a twin-track approach. The preferred option was to suspend implementation of the court decision and stretch payments over a period of years. If that proved legally impossible, though, the government would impose a one-off 'constitutional court tax', so named to underline that the court's decision was behind the tax increase. During his election campaign, Mr Silvio Berlusconi promised to cut taxes. Fears that the pension payment would breach the 1994 budget guidelines and push the public-sector deficit back above 10 per cent of GDP caused sharp falls this week on the Milan bourse and in the bond market. Matters were made worse by the government's delay in clarifying the precise cost of the court decision. The uncertainty has also affected the lira, which closed against the D-Mark yesterday at L983, compared to L958 when Mr Berlusconi was named premier a month ago. Lawyers have raised doubts about suspending or not fully implementing the court decision. The court itself says it would be difficult for parliament to endorse any measure that sought to bypass its authority. Mr Giancarlo Pagliarini, the budget minister, made clear on Thursday if the arrears have to be paid in full, the 1994 budget deficit would still be held down to the target of L154,000bn. That would mean either postponing payment until the 1995 budget or immediately introducing a special tax. On Thursday evening, union leaders reacted angrily to a government decision to impose the one-off tax on pensioners who would benefit from the arrears payments. They threatened immediate action if that were to happen and the government retracted the proposal, indicating that the cost would be spread evenly. The unions also protested that the government had long been aware of the court's impending decision and of its likely impact on the budget. Whatever approach the government adopts, market analysts said the government needs to produce broad outlines for its 1995 budget strategy as soon as possible. Even without the burden of the pension arrears, government critics have suggested this week that its first measures - unfreezing public works contracts and introducing tax breaks for new investments and job creation - will add to the 1994 budget deficit.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Professor Bronislaw Geremek, chairman of the </F> Sejm Commission on Foreign Affairs, by Jaroslaw Gizinski and  Maria Graczyk; place and date not given: "Raison d'etat"]    [Text] [WPROST] Has Poland again, as in the period between  the world wars, found itself in the position of "heat from two  directions?" [w dwa ognie, referring to a children's popular  ball game].    [Geremek] The geography has not changed--the Germans are  still on one side, Russia is on the other. On the other hand,  the geopolitical situation has changed considerably, and,  regardless of the uneasiness that is the result of the  developments of the past several months, one cannot forget the  fact that Poland, for the first time, finds itself in a  situation in which it does not have to fear outside aggression.    This does not mean, however, that one should underestimate  the dangers that are manifesting themselves in the East. Anarchy  in the post-Soviet expanses is a threatening phenomenon. Equally  threatening is the appearance of tendencies that indicate the  resurgence of an imperial domination by Russia. I do not think,  however, that Poland will find itself in the position of being  the solitary sacrifice.    [WPROST] In Bonn and Moscow, one hears talk lately of a  so-called friendly axis between the two countries. A  German-Russian accord over our heads, however, awakens certain  uneasy historical associations.    [Geremek] When [Foreign] Minister Kozyrev spoke on the  subject of the German-Russian axis, his German colleague  Minister Kinkel made no protest. This in itself is reason enough  to feel apprehension. Poland should watch these talks with care.  I do not hide the fact that these talks awaken apprehension in  me as well, but it is necessary to contrast them with other  statements of German public opinion. Such careful observation  allows one to assume that the policy of building Russian-German  relationships over the heads of other partners will not find  support in the German political structure. Such a temptation  exists, however--we recognize it from history and we know what  the results were. Therefore, the guiding principle of Polish  foreign policy should be the perception of a threat,  counteracting it and, at the same time, maintaining a feeling of  realism in the evaluation of an actual threat.    [WPROST] In light of this, can we assure security for  ourselves other than through seeking an alliance with NATO?    [Geremek] The fundamental orientation of Polish foreign  policy is determined by Poland's ties to the West. One cannot  imagine that an eventual conflict that would engulf a nation of  40 million people in the center of Europe would be a regional  conflict, capable of staying limited in scope. However, what is  threatening is the fact that NATO has refused the acceptance of  Poland. The West is repeating old mistakes and is giving in to  political blackmail, in treating the problem of Russia as a  priority problem to which everything else must be subordinated.    [WPROST] Shouldn't one also detect this problem in Polish  foreign policy? In the opinion of Jerzy Giedroyc, "a threat on  the part of Russia was belittled by the governments of the  so-called Third Republic, which proved unable to formulate an  eastern policy."    [Geremek] We achieved one basic thing in Poland's eastern  policy: We freed ourselves from dependence on the Soviet Union,  and we did not fall into dependency on Russia. I also view the  withdrawal of Russian troops from Poland as a success of our  Eastern policy. On the other hand, there is no doubt that Poland  needs to find a friendly partner in Russia, and not a foe. But  this is dependent on the development of democracy in Russia. Our  support of the development of democracy in Russia is in the  interest of Polish raison d'etat.    [WPROST] Relationships with our other Eastern neighbors also  leave much to be desired.    [Geremek] Unfortunately, we have been unable to establish an  active policy of a Polish presence in the East. It is necessary,  however, to take into consideration that this is also due to the  economic situation. If Poland were now able to sell its exports  on credit in Eastern markets, we would have no problem with  attaining these markets. The lack of the necessary financial  sources means that Polish activity in this arena is limited.  Treaties alone will not solve this problem.    Poland should perform its role as a large state in this  region of Europe, but it should not entertain a world-power  fantasy. We must acquire political imagination, which we tend to  lack from time to time. Poland is also active on behalf of the  interests of the Visegrad Group, but successes here are less  than we expected.    [WPROST] Perhaps such initiatives no longer fulfill the  hopes  associated with them?    [Geremek] I think that the Visegrad Group has a future. It  is  a reality inasmuch as a free-trade zone will emerge, in which  all four countries are interested; there is also a mutual  orientation to enter the European Union. I also place a lot of  hope in Baltic cooperation; Poland should play a more active  role in this arena than it has thus far.    [WPROST] In the meantime, however, we find ourselves in a  situation that is hardly optimistic. In vain we knock on the  West's door, while we have nothing to offer to the East.    [Geremek] I am categorically opposed to conclusions of  hopelessness. I say this as a historian and not as a politician.  It would be difficult to envision a political situation in which  Poland's prospects would be better than they are at the present  moment. There exists a real chance that Poland will enter into  all of the agreements that integrate Europe, so that neither  Germany nor Russia would be a threat to Poland. In glancing at  the history of the last one thousand years, this is indeed an  exceptional situation.    At the moment, I do not believe that Poland, in case of an  outside threat, could be left alone to deal with it. An  international arrangement already exists in which aggression  against Poland would result in allies coming to our defense.    [WPROST] Similar confidences prevailed before the World War  II....    [Geremek] At that time we found ourselves between two powers  and both attacked us. I think that now one of them is so sick  that it is in no condition to attack anyone, and the other one  is not interested in doing so. Even so, I recognize both  threats--both German economic hegemony and Russian imperialist  policy.    [WPROST] What will remain for us should decisions that are  unfavorable to us be made at the January NATO summit in Brussels?    [Geremek] One should talk less about NATO and not attach  such  central importance to it. I am convinced that Poland will enter  NATO, or NATO will cease to exist. It is only a matter of time.  We should not only concentrate our attention on the problem of  NATO, but also aim to create conditions of cooperation in the  framework of Europe and concern ourselves with various security  systems.    For the present, the only functioning security system on  European terrain is NATO, and that is why we are interested in  it. At any rate, the pact has to change its character; it must  secure European stability. For the time being, it is not  prepared to do so. Despite the wave of criticism aimed at  Poland's foreign policy, Poland has never been so close to  entering the alliance as it is now. The problem is not if Poland  is to enter NATO, but when.    [WPROST] Isn't this conviction merely a manifestation of  "wishful thinking?"    [Geremek] Attaining membership in NATO is not only a  privilege but also carries with it the necessity of fulfilling  certain conditions, such as, for example, the stabilization of  democracy in the country, which broke away from communism in an  unequivocal manner. A disordered country, without a program for  systemic transformation, is a country that has no chance of  entering NATO. Entry into NATO also means obligations,  far-reaching economic and military obligations. Only after their  fulfillment can we realistically think of participating in the  pact.    Poles are unable to forget their past; every "whirlwind"  that  appears in the East or in the West provokes feelings of a lack  of security. For that reason, membership in NATO has become so  important for us. More and more politicians from various NATO  countries are supporting us in this effort.    [WPROST] There are opinions in the West--not isolated  opinions--that are apt to treat the left-wing electoral victory  in Poland as a serious warning for NATO.    [Geremek] I hope that these fears are not justified, but it  is difficult to say that there are not grounds for them. The  question remains whether the result of the September 1993 Polish  elections should be viewed as a sign that the former political  forces have returned to power or as testimony to the fact that  Poland is sufficiently democratic that the opposition forces can  come to power by means of an election. I favor the optimistic  version: Poland will not return to communism and will remain a  democratic country. I understand, however, the fears of Western  public opinion.    [WPROST] Many Polish politicians refrain from commenting on  the "Zhirinovskiy phenomenon." In your opinion, can this be seen  as an indication of political wisdom or, rather, overconfidence?    [Geremek] I belong to that group of people that does not  make  light of Zhirinovskiy. I believe that those who reduce him to a  mere element of political folklore, minimizing his significance,  act foolishly. This is a phenomenon of great importance. After  all, it is a problem not of the person but of policy. One can  already see what kind of influence this policy exerts on the  present political administration of Russia. We should show  interest in this phenomenon, but we must not be guided by  hysteria.    The opinions now emerging in the West that the major goal is  order in Russia and not the processes of democratic  transformation are becoming dangerous. Poland's voice may have a  certain influence in the manner of thinking about Russia. To  date, however, it is not heard loudly enough.    [WPROST] The Russian minister of foreign affairs recently  claimed that Zhirinovskiy's election success reduces the chances  of the Central European states entering NATO.    [Geremek] I think Minister Kozyrev is mistaken in his  diagnosis. The election results in Russia rather increase the  chances of Poland's getting into NATO. Let us not fool  ourselves, however. What Poland will be in the future does not  depend on the North Atlantic Pact. The situation in Europe and  the world is preparing various surprises for us, and one should  look after one's own army and military potential. There is an  old saying that if one does not spend money on one's own army,  one spends money on a foreign army stationed on one's own soil.  The success of Polish foreign policy depends on the success of  its economy as well as on the competent assurances of its  military potential.    Poland was a leading country in the process of  transformation  and the elimination of communism. One cannot present a bill for  this or expect gratitude. It is, however, a chance for Poland  because Poland can play an active role in organizing the process  of transformation in other countries. Visualizing different  scenarios does not depend on how many tanks one has or on what  kind of budget deficit one has. It depends on one's imagination.  This can become the chance for Polish foreign policy.</p>

			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / Bentsen set to head US Treasury team US President-elect Bill Clinton is expected to announce the first appointments to his administration this week, beginning with an economic team headed by Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas. Mr Bentsen, who as chairman of the Senate finance committee has long familiarity with tax and economic issues, is now thought to be all but certain to be named Treasury secretary. Clinton aides refused comment on the nominations, but said he was 'on the verge' of making an announcement. The post of deputy Treasury secretary is now widely expected to go to Mr Roger Altman, vice chairman of the Blackstone investment banking group, with another investment banker, Mr Robert Rubin of Goldman Sachs, likely to be the principal economic adviser in the White House as head of a new Economic Security Council. Congressman Leon Panetta, chairman of the House of Representatives budget committee, is the front-runner to become director of the Office of Management and Budget, although Ms Alice Rivlin, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office, is also thought to be in contention. Mr Clinton has been in no great haste to name his cabinet, although he has already appointed 'cluster teams' to examine the operations of each government department during the transition period before his inauguration on January 20. Key nominations in the foreign affairs and national security arena may not come for several more days. The process has been slowed by the need for thorough background checks on potential nominees - who may be subjected to close scrutiny during Senate confirmation hearings - and by Mr Clinton's insistence on tough ethical standards barring members of his administration from future dealings with their agencies. Mr John Young, the recently retired president and chief executive of Hewlett-Packard, the computer and electronics manufacturer, has withdrawn his name from consideration for a formal role in the administration. Mr Young had been widely expected to be appointed to a cabinet position, possibly as commerce secretary. His substantial Hewlett-Packard stock and stock options holdings, acquired during his 34-year career at the company, were seen as a barrier to his participation in the administration because they might create the appearance of a conflict of interest. Mr Young is highly regarded for his long-time efforts to address the competitiveness issue as chairman of President Reagan's Commission on Industrial Competitiveness and as the founding chairman of the private-sector Council on Competitiveness and the Computer Systems Policy Project. Some members of the Clinton transition team have begun to wonder whether the new ethics rules may not prove counterproductive by deterring well-qualified candidates for administration posts, particularly at mid-levels. The Democrats will retain 57 seats in the Senate, to the Republicans' 43, following the victory of Mr Kent Conrad in Friday's North Dakota by-election.

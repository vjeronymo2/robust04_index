			<p>940214 FT  14 FEB 94 / Emerging Markets: News round-up Strategy The tightening of monetary policy by the US Fed was reflected in sharp declines last Monday in Hong Kong, Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur, but the Chinese new year kept activity muted thereafter. With today's reopening of the markets many analysts expect a further wobble, but not necessarily another heavy sell-off. Traders expect a short-term range in the Hang Seng index of between 10,000 and 12,500. Mutual funds Emerging market mutual funds based in industrialised countries held assets of Dollars 79.6bn (Pounds 54.5bn) at the end of last year, according to new figures from Micropal Emerging Market Fund Monitor. Some Dollars 7.6bn of that was in emerging market debt funds. Of the equity funds, some Dollars 20.5bn was in Asian regional funds and Dollars 17bn in Asian single country funds, while only Dollars 5.1bn was in Latin American regional funds and Dollars 3.9bn in single country funds. Such figures may support the assertions of some analysts that Asian markets are more vulnerable than Latin markets to shifts by mutual fund investors because of interest rate rises in the US. Pakistan The country's three stock markets, in Karachi, Lahore and Islamabad, are aiming to streamline their operations so that corporate results would become available simultaneously. A complaints centre will also be established to deal with problems of the transfer of shares which, in some instances, can take at least 45 days. Israel The central bank plans to liberalise foreign currency trading rules as the first step towards making the shekel convertible. The authorities said that in a few months' time trading will become continuous - at present the Bank of Israel publishes a representative shekel/dollar rate once a day.

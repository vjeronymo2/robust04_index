			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "ett": "Policy Toward Foreigners: New FPOe </F> Advance"]    [Text] Vienna -- Yesterday, Tuesday, exactly one year  after the petition for a referendum on foreigners, the Freedom  Party of Austria [FPOe] gave the starting signal for a new  action regarding the policy toward foreigners. Since the main  demands of the petition for a referendum called "Austria First"  have not been fulfilled by the government, the initiative  "Austria First II" is now being prepared. At a news conference,  FPOe Chairman Joerg Haider announced that the FPOe will focus on  the policy toward foreigners in its Nationalrat election  campaign.    A catalogue of demands is being developed by a working group  (with Secretary General Herbert Scheibner, security spokeswoman  Helene Partik-Pable, and Vienna City Councillor Hilmar Kabas).  Central points are:     -  A stop to immigration, which is  indispensable;    -  Measures, above all for the reduction of the  number of guest workers who have only been in Austria for a  short time;    -  The imperative deportation of foreigners who have  come into conflict with the law;    -  Strict punishments for the  employment of illegal employees.    If the government is not prepared to establish order, this  will be a subject of political discussion before the Nationalrat  election, Haider announced. The petition for a referendum will  not be repeated: "We do not need it," Haider said because the  Nationalrat election provides the opportunity for secret votes  anyway. There the people can take revenge for the government's  "policy of announcements." The new FPOe initiative regarding  the policy toward foreigners is necessary because the government  apparently has "not learned anything" from the debate on the  petition for a referendum, the FPOe chairman said.    According to Haider, the number of cases where foreigners  who  have come into conflict with the law but are not deported are  increasing. Also the public has been "deceived" by the  statement that foreigners pay more social security contributions  than they get. According to the Social Ministry, except for  contributions to unemployment insurance, the collected amounts  cannot be separated. Partik-Pable criticized: The number of  "illegal foreigners" continues to increase.    The FPOe announcements triggered a wave of indignant  reactions: "Incredible agitation against foreigners" (Willi  Fuhrmann, floor leader of the Social Democratic Party of Austria  -- SPOe). SPOe Executive Secretary Josef Cap talked of a hidden  petition for a referendum on foreigners. Haider is not prepared  to learn from his mistakes, Austrian People's Party [OeVP]  Secretary General Ingrid Korosec criticized; for OeVP security  spokesman Hubert Pirker, Haider is "an ignorant who does not  listen to reason."</p>

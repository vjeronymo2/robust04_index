			<p>CSO     [Text] Toshiba announced on 11 May six types of machines  such as a notebook-type personal computer and full-scale  portable subnotebook personal computer for multimedia that can  be connected to the family television. By putting the new series  on sale, Toshiba aims to ship 1 million (about 40 percent  increase over the previous year) personal computers worldwide in  fiscal 1994.    The "Dynabook EZ Vision" for multimedia not only is used as  an independent notebook personal computer, but game software can  also be enjoyed with impressive graphics and sound by connecting  it to a large television in the home.    Without provision of any special device, it can output  personal computer graphics and audio from the screen and stereo  speakers if it is connected to the family television. It is a  response to those who want to enjoy games and multimedia  software on a big screen. It is loaded with Japanese word  processing and spreadsheet software and also can be used  immediately by beginners after purchase. The price is 278,000  yen.    The subnotebook "SS series" is the first in the world to  house two memory devices, a floppy disk and hard disk, in a B5  file size main body. They aimed at about the same functions as a  desktop personal computer while being small and lightweight with  a weight of 1.95 kilograms.    There are both an 8-inch color liquid crystal display model  and monochrome model. The price is 398,000 yen for the color and  298,000 yen for the monochrome.</p>

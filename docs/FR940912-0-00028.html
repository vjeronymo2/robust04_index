			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FCC recommended that the proposed definition of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``material'' be expanded to recognize the different levels of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reporting and disclosure responsibilities of the System  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> banks and the Funding Corporation. The FCC suggested two  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> separate definitions of ``material.'' One of the suggested  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definitions would apply to the Banks' reporting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsibilities to the Funding Corporation and the second  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would apply to the Funding Corporation's disclosure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsibilities on a Systemwide basis as subject to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> antifraud provisions of the Federal securities laws.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under GAAP, individual materiality judgments are made  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on a case-by-case basis and materiality is measured at each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reporting level in light of surrounding circumstances. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> GAAP position is supported by FAC No. 2 and recognizes that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> no general standards of materiality could be formulated to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> take into account all the considerations that enter into an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> experienced human judgment. In line with this approach to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the concept of materiality, the FCA believes that it is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unnecessary to include, as suggested by the FCC, two  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> separate definitions of ``material.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Materiality judgments regarding information presented  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> outside the financial statements, while not covered by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> GAAP definition, are governed by current standards of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> materiality under the securities laws. <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  The FCA believes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the case law standard of materiality provides  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sufficient guidance to the System in preparing information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be presented outside the financial statements. To avoid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any confusion between the GAAP materiality standard which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> governs preparation of the financial statements, and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard of materiality enunciated in the case law, which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> governs information presented outside of the financial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statements, the proposed definition of ``material'' has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eliminated from the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See TSC Indus., Inc.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Northway, Inc.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 426 U.S. 438, 449 (1976) and cases following. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Section 630.2(g)_Definition of ``Report to Investors''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FCC commented that, although the preamble clarifies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the term ``report to investors'' used throughout the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed rule is intended to mean the Information Statement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> currently published by the Funding Corporation, confusion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exists as to whether the term refers to the FCS Report or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Information Statement. Because the FCS Report currently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prepared by the Funding Corporation contains certain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information that is not part of the System Disclosure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Program, and for which System banks are not responsible, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FCC suggested that all references to the ``report to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> investors'' in the regulation be replaced with the term  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Information Statement.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FCA does not intend to regulate the name of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> report required by this part. The term ``report to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> investors'' used in the proposed rule is merely a general  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reference to the disclosure document required by this part.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, in response to the FCC's comment, a new definition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of ``report to investors'' has been added as &sect;630.2(g) of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> final rule to clarify that the term ``report to investors''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> referred to in the regulations means ``a report that presents  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Systemwide combined financial statements, supplemental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> financial statement information, and related financial and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonfinancial information pertaining to the System required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by this part.'' Under this provision, a document containing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only information that is not required by this part and that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is clearly identified as separate from the required report  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will not be subject to this final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

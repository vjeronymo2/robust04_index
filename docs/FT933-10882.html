			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / Israel blocks deportation Israel's Supreme Court, after clearing Mr John Demjanjuk last week of being Nazi death camp guard 'Ivan the Terrible', blocked his deportation to Ukraine yesterday while considering if he can stand trial for other war crimes, Reuter reports from Jerusalem. A five-judge court acquitted Mr Demjanjuk. Yesterday a separate three-judge panel, acting on a complaint by two Israelis, gave government prosecutors seven days to show why Mr Demjanjuk should not be investigated anew based on allegations that he was a guard at other Nazi camps. 'The discussion will resume in 10 days. In seven days the attorney-general will submit his arguments, and he won't be deported until then,' presiding judge Mr Shlomo Levin said. A former car worker, Mr Demjanjuk was stripped of his US citizenship in 1981 for concealing his wartime activities when he entered America and moved to Cleveland, Ohio, after the second world war. He was extradited to Israel in 1986 and still hopes to regain his US citizenship over objections by the Justice Department.</p>

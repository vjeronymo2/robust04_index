			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Feng Xiuju (7458 4423 5468)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 12 Apr (XINHUA) -- President Jiang Zemin  met with Portuguese Prime Minister Silva at Zhongnanhai this  afternoon. The two leaders expressed full confidence in the  continuous growth of bilateral relations and the smooth  implementation of the Sino- Portuguese Joint Declaration on the  Macao Question.    Jiang Zemin recalled with delight the good impression he had  of Portugal when he visited that country last November. He  said: "We appreciate Prime Minister Silva's positive efforts at  developing Sino-Portuguese friendly and cooperation relations."    He said: Despite the geographical distance and different  social systems, China and Portugal share common interests in  safeguarding world peace and stability, as well as common needs  to develop bilateral cooperation.    He expressed the belief that so long as the two countries  observe the principles of mutual respect, equality, and mutual  benefit, bilateral relations will grow continuously.    Turning to the Macao question, Jiang Zemin said: During His  Excellency Prime Minister Silva's visit to China in 1987, he  signed with the Chinese Government a document of great  importance, that is, the Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration on  the Macao Question. Since the joint declaration was signed and  since it entered into force, the two countries have cooperated  in seriously implementing it. Facts show that the joint  declaration has laid a solid foundation for Macao's stable  development and the friendly cooperation between the two  countries on the Macao question. It has also set a good example  for the peaceful settlement of problems left over from history  between two countries.    Jiang Zemin said: Only five or more years remain in Macao's  transitional period. The work facing China and Portugal is  arduous; and the two countries should expedite the solution to a  number of questions.    He said: So long as China and Portugal step up consultations  and cooperate closely, the two countries will certainly be able  to properly solve various questions during the transitional  period.    The Portuguese prime minister said: Since the signing of the  Portuguese-Chinese Joint Decclaration on the Macao Question, the  two countries have conducted fruitful cooperation in  implementing it, while smoothly expanding friendly cooperation  in other areas.    He said: Portugal and China share identical views on many  international issues, face an identical task of improving the  people's living standards, and have common interests in solving  the Macao question. "We hope the visit will further promote  cooperation between the two countries in the political,  economic, and scientific fields."    Jiang Zemin asked Silva to convey his greetings to  Portuguese  President Soares.    Peng Qingyuan, executive vice chairman of the Kuomintang  Revlutionary Committee Central Committee; Liu Xiliang, head of  the Chinese Government Reception Committee and vice minister of  radio, film, and television; and Jiang Enzhu, vice minister of  foreign affairs; were present at the meeting.</p>

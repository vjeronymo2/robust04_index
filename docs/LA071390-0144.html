			<p><P> July 13, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: REAL ESTATE;  </P> <P> DEVELOPERS SEE POTENTIAL PROFITS IN COSTA MESA'S DOWNTOWN BUSINESS AREA  </P> <P> Costa Mesa's old downtown was once called "Goat Hill" and is commemorated by a  tavern of the same name near the intersection of Harbor and Newport boulevards.  But the city's downtown has shifted in the last 20 years from south to  northwest.  </P> <P> It is now centered on the huge South Coast Plaza shopping mall and the big  office buildings across Bristol Street from the mall.  </P> <P> The old downtown -- once slightly shabby as attention shifted to the mall --  has been getting a face lift recently from developers who see it as a good  location with access to a sizable market. The latest developers to try their  luck include a group of Southern Californians backed by British money who will  build 185,000 square feet of shops and boutiques, eight movie theaters,  restaurants and a supermarket in the triangle formed by Harbor and Newport  boulevards and 19th Street.  </P> <P> The new Triangle Square will feature arches, domes, towers and columns in a  Mediterranean motif that will loom large over the intersection, compared to the  low row of one-story shops that were torn down to make way for the new  construction.  </P> <P> The three sides of the new building will surround an open courtyard designed  for foot traffic.  </P> <P> Developers are Klein Enterprises, developer of One Pacific Plaza in Huntington  Beach; Pacific Development Partners, with major redevelopment projects in  Inglewood and Compton; and developer Richard J. Shapiro. The developers are  joint venturing with Capital &amp; Counties USA Inc., the U.S. arm of a British  developer.  </P> <P> The building is scheduled to open in the spring of 1992.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> However, the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.23(b)(4) require an independent certified public accountant's (CPA) audit or review opinion on the accuracy of the information in the financial statement. By letter of February 17, 1994 (Administrative Record No. 823.09), Pennsylvania stated that the purpose of the definition was to address those circumstances where the CPA was a sole practitioner whose primary client was the applicant. The Director believes the application of this definition to be an additional safeguard to Pennsylvania's self-bonding program. Therefore, the Director finds the proposed definition to be not inconsistent with the requirements of SMCRA and the Federal regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> j. Liability. Pennsylvania proposes to add this definition to mean an obligation to transfer assets or provide services to other entities in the future as a result of past transactions. The Director finds that the proposed definition is substantively identical to the Federal definition of ``liability'' at 30 CFR 800.23(a). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> k. Net worth. Pennsylvania proposes to modify its definition to mean total assets minus total liabilities and is equivalent to owner's equity. The Director finds that the proposed definition is identical to the Federal definition of ``net worth'' at 30 CFR 800.23(a). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> l. Parent corporation. Pennsylvania proposes to add this definition to mean the corporation which directly owns or controls the corporation which is the applicant. The Director finds that the proposed definition is substantively identical to the Federal definition of ``parent corporation'' at 30 CFR 800.23(a). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> m. Self-bond. Pennsylvania proposes to revise its definition of ``self-bond'' to mean an indemnity agreement in a sum certain payable to the Department, executed by the permittee and by each individual and business organization capable of influencing or controlling the investment or financial practices of the permittee by virtue of his authority as an officer or ownership of all or a significant part of the permittee, and supported by agreements granting the Department a security interest in real or personal property pledged to secure performance by the permittee. The proposed State and Federal definitions of ``self-bond'' are similar with the additional requirements in the State's rule for indemnification by the controllers and significant owners of the self-bonded permittee, and for the pledging of real or personal property collateral to secure the self-bond. In addition, to those reasons discussed at Finding 1.c., the State's requirement for collateralized self-bonds serves to provide security for the self-bonding obligation and elevates the State's position to that of a secured creditor if there is a bankruptcy of the self-bonded permittee. Therefore, the Director finds that the State's revised definition of ``self-bond'' is no less effective than the corresponding Federal requirements at 30 CFR 800.5(c). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> n. Tangible net worth. Pennsylvania proposes to add this definition to mean net worth minus intangibles such as goodwill and rights to patents or royalties. The Director finds that the proposed definition is identical to and no less effective than the Federal definition of ``tangible net worth'' at 30 CFR 800.23(a). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> o. Liquidity ratio. Pennsylvania proposes to delete this definition. Since there is no counterpart Federal definition for ``liquidity ratio,'' the Director finds that the deletion of this definition does not render the Pennsylvania program less effective than the Federal requirements at 30 CFR 800.23 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> p. Quick assets. Pennsylvania proposes to delete this definition. There is no counterpart Federal definition for ``quick assets.'' Therefore, the Director finds that the deletion of this definition does not render the Pennsylvania program less effective than the Federal requirements at 30 CFR 800.23. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> q. Retained earnings. Pennsylvania proposes to delete this definition. Since there is no counterpart Federal definition for ``retained earnings,'' the Director finds that the deletion of this definition does not render the Pennsylvania program less effective than the Federal requirements at 30 CFR 800.23. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Section 86.159 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pennsylvania is proposing to revise section 86.159 to establish the procedures and criteria to be used by the regulatory authority in determining whether a coal mine permittee is eligible to use self-bonding in lieu of a surety or collateral bond. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Federal self-bonding rules at 30 CFR 800.23 establish minimum standards of financial eligibility to self-bond for States that wish to allow self-bonding. These rules also allow a regulatory authority to accept the guarantee of a qualified parent corporation for its subsidiaries. ``States choosing to allow self-bonding may adopt more detailed rules that reflect the financial structures of the local industry, if necessary to provide the regulatory authority additional protection from risk of forfeiture.'' 48 FR 36418, 36419 (August 10, 1983). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

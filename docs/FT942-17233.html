			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / Arts: Today's Television Television's obsession with race continues to grow, and to elbow out other, arguably more important, matters from the schedules. Timewatch, our only regular history programme, is devoted entirely to the matter of Britain's policy on black immigrants in the 1950s. It seems that in 1954 Winston Churchill said that this was 'the most important question facing the cabinet' but that he could not get his ministers to take notice. Meaning, presumably, that they did not share his view (8.10 BBC2). Dispatches reports from Africa. Guess which country? How did you know? Because elsewhere in that vast continent it is more difficult to work on the assumption that brown-against-brown tribal conflict is the fault of whites? Maybe. This programme is about the miraculous revival of Winnie Mandela (9.00 C4). BBC2's Screen Two drama, Dirtysomething (geddit?) is about Dog and Becca, hippies who meet at the Glastonbury Festival, then settle into a squat and face the prospect of becoming yuppies . . . well, of losing their New Age ideals, anyway (9.00 BBC2).</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Hamid Deronjic from Brcko] </F>   [Text] Last night on the Brcko front was marked by the  Serb aggressor's provocative fire. The chetniks were firing  with small arms along the entire front line, while on the  central part of the front the aggressor also used grenades,  portable rocket launchers, and Broving. Last night at 1935 from  the direction of Cadjavac the enemy shelled the defense  positions in Vranovaca, and at about 2000 the chetnik  antiaircraft guns and machine guns fiercely pounded Boderiste.    Strong chetnik infantry forces are constantly on the move,  searching for the best positions for offensive activities. Last  night the enemy sabotage and reconnaissance groups were the most  active on the central part of the front, facing the positions of  the 108th Motorized Brigade and the 108th Infantry Brigade in  the region of Vranovaca and Boderiste.    The Serb aggressor is trying to forge an excuse for  launching  his long-planned offensive, now that the UN observers are in the  temporarily occupied Brcko. The chetniks are currently trying  to do this with their propaganda campaign concerning the alleged  attacks by the fighters of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army on  civilian targets in Brcko. However, after the unfortunate  episodes in Srebrenica, Zepa, Gorazde -- and after the transport  of the chetnik tanks through the protected zone in Sarajevo,  when one of the aggressor's tanks mysteriously disappeared --  the chetniks simply cannot be trusted with anything.</p>

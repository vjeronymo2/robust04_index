			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Platinum falls in hectic trading PLATINUM'S PRICE fell sharply in hectic trading in London and New York yesterday following an announcement that another automotive catalyst using palladium instead of platinum had been developed in Japan. In spite of assertions by the industry that the Japanese development would have little, if any impact, on the platinum market, it sparked two waves of selling - initially among professionals as the news broke and later by US funds before trading began in New York. Platinum closed in London at Dollars 380.85 a troy ounce, down Dollars 9.85. Dealers suggested that the Japanese development was simply used as an excuse to sell by investors who had recently bought platinum because of growing political tension and violence in South Africa, the world's biggest producer and responsible for more than 65 per cent of supply. However, chances of a serious interruption to platinum production seem to be drifting away. For example, a draft peace charter was drawn up in South Africa last week by unions and business leaders which might be ratified soon. The accord could head off the general strike planned for August 3 and limit it to one day. Why European and New York markets did not react to this development on Monday is not clear. However, yesterday the Japanese National Institute for Resources and Environment (NIRE) brought attention back to platinum briefly by announcing it would give details of its new automotive catalyst next week. Automotive catalysts provide platinum's biggest market but Mr Brian Nathan, managing director of Ayrton Metals, pointed out that NIRE referred only to diesel catalysts which already are based on palladium, a cheaper material, rather than platinum or rhodium. He also pointed out that NIRE had given no indication when the new catalyst, based on magnesium-alumate and palladium, would be available or in use. Some analysts suggested last night that, as political tension eases in South Africa, the platinum price could ease back to Dollars 370 an ounce or even to Dollars 360 where it stood before its recent rise.</p>

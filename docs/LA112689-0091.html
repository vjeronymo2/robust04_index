			<p><P> November 26, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PASTOR AND MISSION FUNDS  </P> <P> I take exception to the implication The Times made in its Nov. 20 edition in  which a picture of Pastor Chuck Swindoll was shown with a recap of the funds  his mission was capable of generating in 1988.  </P> <P> With all the "witch hunting" taking place in our society today regarding  televangelism, I think it only fair that you write an article on the great  things that "Insights for Living" has done for people throughout the world.  </P> <P> If you're not willing to that, how about publishing the profits of the Los  Angeles Times?  </P> <P> RON KEE  </P> <P> Garden Grove  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 31, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> SHERIFF'S DEPUTY SHOOTS, KILLS PROWLER IN LAGUNA HILLS AREA  </P> <P> An Orange County sheriff's deputy shot and killed a suspected prowler who  police said had pointed a handgun at investigating officers, authorities said  today.  </P> <P> The deputy was investigating an emergency call from a Laguna Hills resident who  had reported a man trying to break into a kitchen window, neighbors said.  </P> <P> The deputy, whom authorities declined to name, fired at the unidentified man  during a confrontation in the back of the house, according to police.  </P> <P> The man was pronounced dead at Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center almost  two hours after the 12:26 a.m. shooting, hospital spokeswoman Jan Walker said.  </P> <P> Sheriff's Department spokesman Lt. Richard Olson said that the shooting  occurred when deputies in the department's Laguna Niguel substation responded  to an emergency call from a woman living in a house on the 2500 block of La  Suen Road, near La Paz Road and the San Diego Freeway. The woman, whom Olson  declined to identify, told authorities that a man was trying to break into her  kitchen window, neighbors said.  </P> <P> When deputies arrived and walked to the rear of the darkened house, they  confronted a man, Olson said.  </P> <P> "They ordered the suspect to raise his hands," Olson said. "When the suspect  raised his hands, they observed a handgun in his right hand."  </P> <P> At that point, Olson said, the suspect pointed the handgun at them, and one of  the deputies fired. Neighbors reported that two shots were fired.  </P> <P> Olson declined to discuss details of the shooting, saying the Orange County  district attorney's office is investigating.  </P></p>

The Chinese  Ministry of Public Security made the statement on Monday [7  March] after overseas news organizations carried lists of  dissidents detained during the weekend. The ministry explained  some of the dissidents listed are under investigation because  they are suspected of inciting turmoil and disrupting social  order. Others named have not been detained.    The dissident Wei Jingsheng, one of those named by the  foreign media, has applied for permission to leave Beijing on a  private matter. The ministry said his application has been  approved.</p>

			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / Letter: Daf never big enough to absorb Leyland Sir, Your article 'Driven to a grinding halt' (February 3) with respect fails to address itself to the real problems within Daf. The dream to become an important player in the European truck league was fraught with problems from the outset. The company may have posted record profits in 1989, but so they should have, when truck sales throughout Europe were at record levels. I suggest that Daf was never a big enough company (in every sense) to have absorbed Leyland in the beginning. Being the market leader in the UK, on the one hand, and losing money on the other, is pure vanity; surely their priorities should have been rationalisation, model integration and restructuring, thus enabling them to have a better chance of competing in a European market that has been suffering with overcapacity for years. Is this the golden opportunity for Hino to take over Leyland in the UK? Denis A I Wright, 46 Rugby Road, Dunchurch, Rugby CV22 6PN</p>

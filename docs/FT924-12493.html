			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Survey of World Car Industry (10): Overtaken on the bends - Italy's Fiat falls behind in Europe THESE are challenging times for Fiat. August's new car registrations in western Europe show that the Turin auto-maker suffered a 7.1 per cent volume drop in the first eight months of the year, giving it 12 per cent of the market. After failing only by the narrowest of margins to capture the number one position in west Europe from the Volkswagen group in 1988 and 1989 with a share of 14.9 per cent, Fiat has slipped back since 1990. A contributory factor has been the Fiat Group's continuing slide in its home market. Deliveries of the Group's Lancia-Autobianchi, Alfa Romeo and Innocenti ranges in Italy have all fallen heavily. In the first eight months of the year Lancia-Autobianchi's figures were 8.8 per cent lower with 124,700 deliveries, while Alfa Romeo was 4.4 per cent down with 77,600 and Innocenti 16.1 per cent down with 8,900. Of the Turin Group's principal badges only Fiat advanced, improving by 1.8 per cent to 544,200 deliveries. But in a market that grew by 4.7 per cent, the increase in the number of deliveries was insufficient for Fiat to keep its market share. This fell from 32.7 to 31.8 per cent. In contrast to the Fiat Group, importers have been enjoying a good year in Italy. Their deliveries rose by 9.8 per cent to 956,500, and their aggregate market share increased from 53.2 to 55.8 per cent. Fiat has been missing the opportunities offered by a strong home market. 'We expect deliveries of new cars to be almost 2.3m this year, only slightly down on 1991 and confirming Italy as Europe's second largest market,' say officials at Unione Nazionale Distributori Automotoveicoli (the importers' association UNRAE). They attribute the buoyancy to two factors: traffic restrictions in large cities at the beginning of the year which encouraged purchases of new cars fitted with catalytic exhausts and the large backlog of orders for new models such as Volkswagen's Golf and GM's Astra. UNRAE's figures show that Volkswagen recorded an increase of 28.4 per cent in the first eight months, and with deliveries of 172,000 it took 10.0 per cent of the total market. GM achieved a rise of 37.4 per cent to 92,400 deliveries and a market share of 5.4 per cent. But notwithstanding this improvement, GM still lags behind Ford (11.2 per market share) and Renault (7.8 per cent) in the importers' league, as well as Volkswagen. 'Competition between all the makers, Fiat Group and the importers, has always been tough,' notes UNRAE. That market gains are ferociously sought and expensively bought in Italy has been especially clear to Italian television viewers and newspaper readers this year, as car makers have engaged in very competitive marketing across the media. Price has been an important weapon, and it has been used extensively by Fiat which has offered low-cost finance and extra trade-in discounts to lure potential buyers into its showrooms. Already conscious of the price factor, importers are concerned that the lira's devaluation and exit from the ERM will reverse the gains they have made. Cars of German and French origin are the most vulnerable. UNRAE officials note that foreign makers are trying to absorb the higher lire costs. 'In seeking market share, importers have kept their half-yearly list rises between 1.5 and 2 per cent.' UNRAE points out that the recent emergency economic package will help Fiat. Protectionism is never far below the surface, and the Turin Group should benefit if a discernible undercurrent of 'Buy Italian' sentiment develops into full flood. With conditions becoming tougher, this is not the easiest time for Japanese makers to tackle the Italian market. However, importing mainly from Britain and Spain, they should not be handicapped by the lira's devaluation against the D-Mark and French franc. Japanese cars have long been presented as a threat to be fought with all possible means. It is significant that Ford and Opel and other GM models are categorised as German, rather than as US transplants, whereas British or Spanish cars bearing Japanese badges are labelled with Japan as producer country. Results so far this year suggest, however, that they have not suffered. Nissan's sales have roared ahead. Deliveries of 17,000 between January and August were 41.2 per cent higher than in the same period last year, giving Nissan market share of 1.0 per cent. Honda's deliveries advanced by 19.5 per cent to 7,400, and a market share of 0.4 per cent. And while Toyota's deliveries were virtually static at 3,300, this will change when its British plant starts producing. Italians are not immune to the appeal of Japanese technology and reliability, particularly when these qualities are allied to design flair. Attractive new models with Japanese names are winning ground in an Italian market in which the clock will not be turned back to the era of Fiat rule. Indeed, the Turin Group will have a hard struggle to keep its share above 40 per cent over the next two years. With the continuous flow of new models from foreign makers, Fiat Group will be fully stretched to hold ground through face-lifting efforts to its ageing range. Launched earlier this year, the small 'Cinquecento' made by Fiat's Polish venture cannot be expected to spearhead a recovery. Volumes are too small, with a substantial part destined, in any case, for the Polish market, and margins are low on such a car. Fiat will have to wait until new models are leaving the production lines at the green-field plant currently under construction at Melfi in Italy's instep region of Basilicata. Declaring its six-monthly results at the end of September, Fiat recorded pre-tax profits down from L1,455bn to L655bn and a significant worsening of net financial position from surplus of L431bn to indebtedness of L2,510bn. 'The prospects for the second half appear even more difficult. To the virtual stagnation of the world economy are added the effects on demand of the measures that the Italian government is adopting,' says Fiat. The company adds, 'Macroeconomic conditions pose a great challenge to the company.' Next year offers much gloomier prospects than 1992. With its Melfi models, Fiat cannot afford less than immediate, blockbusting winners.</p>

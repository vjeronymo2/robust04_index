			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Mexico City Radio ACIR Network in  Spanish at 0000 GMT on 8 April broadcasts live, during its "ACIR  Radio News" newscast, an interview with Diego Fernandez de  Cevallos, presidential candidate of Mexico's National Action  Party, PAN, by an unidentified interviewer.    After commenting on the preelection political campaign and  the assassination of Institutional Revolutionary Party, PRI,  presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio, Fernandez says  should he win the elections, he would include members of other  parties in his cabinet, "not only PAN members, not at all. I  would have to firmly adhere to my ideas and appoint to the  topmost positions of public administration individuals who  belong to other parties or no party in particular. There are  academicians, industrialists, ranchers, and peasants who could  hold various positions in the government who are more  knowledgeable than many politicians who would like to hold all  the positions and pretend to be good for anything." He expresses  disagreement with the PRI, whose members, he says, "seem to be  so versatile that they are appointed to any position."    Asked about his party's economic platform, Fernandez says:  "PAN's economic proposal is broad and firm. We admit several of  the current government's macroeconomic measures have been  positive. No one can deny restructuring the state's finances as  well as reordering, reducing, and renegotiating Mexico's foreign  debt, attempting to reduce inflation considerably, and trimming  the government apparatus by selling many enterprises that should  have never been purchased in the first place are positive." He  says the government has polarized the country's economic life by  making the rich richer and the rest poorer. PAN proposes, he  says, "a social market economic system, which consists of  prioritizing labor over capital. Labor must be protected, but  it must be kept in mind that labor requires capital. A key  issue is the millions of unemployed and underemployed in  Mexico." Fernandez says permanent, well-paying jobs are  required, which would be created through the creation of  state-supported enterprises which would in turn "direct the  economy, which supports those jobs. All this requires secure  and productive investments. Another requirement is a legal  guarantee investment protected by law. A third requirement is  capital. Mexico does not have resources of its own to create  enterprises and jobs," says Fernandez.    Resources must come from abroad, he adds. Mexico has failed  in economic growth due to, he says, "the government's  centralist, authoritarian policies. Mexico needs to create the  necessary conditions for foreign capital investment on a  long-term basis with sound infrastructure."    Fernandez, answering a caller's question on the low income  of  social security pensioners, says: "The parties have been  discussing the issue, and PAN has proposed immediate measures to  correct this situation."    The PAN candidate finally says he offers the Mexican people  "a democratic alternative," and he invites all to participate  "in an honest electoral campaign and clean elections."</p>

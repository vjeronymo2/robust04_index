			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Clinton replaces White House chief of staff in shake-up President Bill Clinton announced a thorough shake-up of his top aides yesterday in an effort to head off incessant criticism of the White House's lack of organisation and leadership. The shake-up will bring Mr Leon Panetta, the former congressman who now heads the Office of Management and Budget, into the White House as chief of staff in place of Mr Thomas 'Mack' McLarty, Mr Clinton's boyhood friend from Arkansas. Mr McLarty, who himself approached the president with the idea of reshuffling the White House staff, will become a senior counsellor to Mr Clinton with particular responsibility for shepherding legislation through Congress and maintaining the White House's relationships with members of Congress and political constituencies. Ms Alice Rivlin, currently Mr Panetta's deputy at OMB, will take over the top budget position, if she is confirmed by the Senate, while Mr David Gergen, the former Reagan communications guru who was brought into the White House last year in a bid to produce a more coherent message, will take on a new role as special adviser on foreign policy both to Mr Clinton and secretary of state Warren Christopher. Mr Clinton said the reshuffle was intended 'to find the highest and best use for a talented and dedicated group of people', and was not in any sense an avowal of failures in the White House organisation. Mr McLarty said he had felt for some time it was essential 'that we put the strongest possible team on the field in this critical year and that we put people in positions that best suit their talents and abilities'. But politicians and officials around Washington said it would be very difficult to shake the impression that Mr McLarty was being demoted. Although everyone found him a decent and likeable man, not everyone felt that he had taken tight enough control of the White House structure. The image of disarray has been reinforced by repeated incidents such as the use of a Marine helicopter for a golfing trip by two senior aides and the purloining of embroidered towels and bathrobes, possibly by other White House staff members, from a Navy aircraft carrier. A recent book by Mr Bob Woodward, the Washington Post reporter of Watergate fame, portrayed a chaotic White House torn by divisions between Mr Clinton's political advisers and his economic policy team. However, while criticisms of the Clinton White House have been greatly exaggerated - previous White Houses have often been just as chaotic - yet there remains a kernel of serious concern about the administration's indecisiveness, particularly in international affairs. That indecisiveness, however, stems less from the White House management structure than from Mr Clinton's own character and lack of priorities. Washington veterans doubted whether moving Mr Gergen to a role in articulating foreign policy would solve the underlying weaknesses in Mr Clinton's foreign policy. 'The problem is not only the message; the problem is substance,' said Mr Zbigniew Brzezinski, who was national security adviser to former president Jimmy Carter. Although Mr Clinton insisted yesterday that Mr McLarty was 'not going anywhere' and remained his 'closest and most trusted personal adviser', it seemed clear that the former gas company executive, like so many of the friends that Mr Clinton brought with him from his home state, would soon be heading back to Arkansas. Mr Panetta, who represented a California district in Congress for 16 years and chaired the House of Representatives budget committee before moving to OMB, is, like so many of those who have replaced the Arkansans, a veteran of Washington politics. Mr McLarty's own comments yesterday sounded very like a farewell to Washington, while the tributes of his colleagues sounded more like an obituary.

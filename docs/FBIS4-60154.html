			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary prepared by the News Research and Commentaries </F> Group]    [Text] Most of the attention in the Middle East remains  focused on the illegal acts in east Lebanon by the regime  occupying Jerusalem. Three days ago this regime's commandos  kidnapped Mustafa al-Dirani, an official in Lebanon's Islamic  Resistance, and took him to occupied Palestine. Al-Dirani is  now being questioned and tortured by Israeli agents and, in  their comments, Zionist officials have described this terrorist  act as a sign of the Israeli army's capability, saying that the  reason behind the kidnapping was to find out where one of its  pilots whose plane crashed in Lebanon eight years ago is being  held.    The Israeli aggressors have always resorted to terrorist  means and have abducted or martyred people and 'ulema in south  Lebanon. Among these acts, reference can be made to the  abduction of Shaykh 'Ubayd, a Muslim leader, and the martyring  of Sayyid 'Abbas al-Musawi, the Lebanese Hizballah leader, and  members of his family. But naturally, attacks on defenseless  villages, armed attacks on homes where only women and children  are being housed, and the killing of unarmed men actually show  the weakness, not the military might, of the regime occupying  Jerusalem.    Another fundamental point is the silence by world forums on  this flagrant violation of international regulations and the  abduction of people from another country. In addition to  trampling on the sovereignty of Lebanon, this act basically  shows how Israel ignores international regulations and turns a  blind eye to principles that it has apparently endorsed.  Undoubtedly, a serious stance by the United Nations and support  by free countries can lead to an effective condemnation of  Israel and its mentors. At the same time, it should be expected  that the most crushing answer to this feeble act come from  combatant Muslims whose valorous deeds have always inflicted the  greatest and strongest blows on the Zionist regime.</p>

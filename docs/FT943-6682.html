			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / International Company News: Viag's 35% rise in first half meets expectations Viag, the German energy and industrial conglomerate, yesterday reported a 35 per cent rise in first-half pre-tax profits to DM411m (Dollars 266m), as expected, and forecast that full-year results would show a similar profits increase. The company said the results of far-reaching restructuring in recent years were beginning to feed through, and that the figures had also been helped by acquisitions. Turnover in the first six months rose to DM12.62bn, up 4 per cent on the same period the year before, with seven of the group's eight divisions reporting improved sales. Only aluminium, the group's second-biggest sector, saw a fall in turnover, down 6.7 per cent to DM2.33bn. The division has undergone extensive restructuring and has been suffering from low aluminium prices and cheaper imports from the former Soviet Union. However, the company said aluminium orders were 'lively' and there were signs that the world price was improving. The group said it had benefited from better prospects for the German economy, notably in the transport and trading divisions. However, in other divisions, notably glass and metal packaging, the rise in turnover was helped by acquisitions. Gerresheimer, the 51 per cent owned glass-making subsidiary, lifted turnover by 12 per cent following the purchase of a 51 per cent stake in Kimble, a leading US manufacturer. Viag this week completed the 100 per cent takeover of Bayernwerk, Germany's third largest utility, a purchase which is set to increase group turnover to about DM40bn, making it one of the top 10 German companies in sales terms. The full 1994 results will reflect the incorporation of Bayernwerk for the last four months of the year, distorting results compared with those reported last year, the company warned.</p>

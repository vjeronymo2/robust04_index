			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / UK Company News: S&amp;N in Pounds 80m expansion of French holiday activities SCOTTISH &amp; Newcastle, the brewing, leisure and retail group, has opened an Pounds 80m Center Parcs holiday village at Chaumont in the Loire Valley, south of Paris. The development is the second in France - the other is in Normandy - but despite the doubling of capacity, the company said the Chaumont village was already achieving occupancy rates of more than 90 per cent. 'In spite of the recession in Europe, Center Parc's bookings are ahead of last year in all the countries (the UK, Netherlands and Belgium) in which they trade,' it added. Another Center Parcs is due to open at Longleat, Wiltshire, next summer, bringing the total number of villages to 14. Apart from the new developments, S&amp;N last year continued to invest in expanding facilities at the villages - including adventure golf at six centres in the Netherlands and Belgium, and a nine-hole golf course at Elveden Forest in the UK. S&amp;N's leisure division, which also includes Pontin's, now contributes about a third of group operating profits. Center Parcs, according to industry estimates, accounted for 80 per cent of the division's reported profits of Pounds 78m on turnover of Pounds 335m in the year to May 2.</p>

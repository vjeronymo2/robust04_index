			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Major General Amnon Shahaq, deputy chief of staff,  today briefed the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee.  Shahaq, who also heads the Security Committee of the Taba talks,  said that the talks will resume on 31 January, provided that  issues currently in disagreement will be settled in the upcoming  meeting between Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres and PLO leader  Yasir 'Arafat. Our Knesset correspondent Tamar Asalem reports:    [Begin recording] [Asalem] Maj. Gen. Shahaq, deputy chief  of staff, like all the other persons involved in the peace  talks, is waiting for the results of the Peres-'Arafat meeting  next weekend. Shahaq said that the prime minister and the  foreign minister were briefed this morning about the Army's  security stands, which will be presented in the meeting with  'Arafat. If indeed agreements are made over the weekend, the  Security Committee of the Taba talks will reconvene as soon as  31 January.    Gen. Shahaq addressed the claim that Fatah Hawks have been  joining Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] and taking part in  terror attacks against Israel:    [Shahaq] We have witnessed cases where some of those  identified with the Fatah Hawks said they do not accept the PLO  or Fatah authority, that they are quitting the organization, and  that they will continue to fight against us. We, at the same  time, stated that we will continue fighting them until we catch  them.    [Asalem] Shahaq added that the PLO does not yet have full  authority over the field, and cannot impose its will on  individuals who quit Fatah. In any event, Shahaq said, the IDF  will be in charge of capturing the fugitives until April. I do  not know what status they will have in the eyes of the  Palestinian police force, he added.    Gen. Shahaq stated that a real war is being waged in south  Lebanon.    [Shahaq] This is war, waged daily in more than one way by  more than one organization -- not just Hizballah fights us and  the SLA [South Lebanese Army] there. The IDF and the SLA  soldiers carry the burden of this war in south Lebanon.    [Asalem] Shahaq said that the number of incidents in the  north has doubled last year, in comparison to 1992.  Nevertheless, over the past several weeks, there has been a  decline in the volume and nature of Hizballah activity. The  Army explains this by the fact that Syria had pressured  Hizballah before the Clinton-al-Asad summit last week.    Regarding Syria, Gen. Shahaq addressed himself to the  remarks  by Major General 'Uzi Dayan [that war may break out this year if  the peace talks fail], and said that he fails to understand the  storm they caused. According to Shahaq, Dayan was not  presenting an evaluation of the situation, rather he presented  working assumptions of the Planning Branch, which is a routine  matter.    To conclude, Shahaq was asked about his personal stand  regarding the fact that members of the Knesset committee have  occassionaly been wondering about the involvement of military  men in peace negotiations. Shahaq answered that he does not  have a problem with this and, should he have a problem with it,  he will present it to the appropriate officials. [end recording]</p>

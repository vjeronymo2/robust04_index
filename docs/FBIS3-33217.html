			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] San Salvador, 19 Feb (DPA) -- The so-called "Joint  Group for the Investigation of Illegal Armed Groups with  Political Motivations" announced today the start of its  operations at the national level as part of the process for the  consolidation of peace in El Salvador.    The group, which will be responsible for investigating  criminal activities committed by illegal armed groups with  political motivations, better known as "death squads," announced  in paid ads published in today's San Salvador newspapers that  since 1 February its offices have been established and it has  the necessary personnel to carry out its duties.    The previously mentioned organization was created by the  Salvadoran Government with the consent of UN Secretary General  Butrus Butrus-Ghali given the increase in the number of "death  squad-style" murders late last year, which even cost the lives  of various commanders of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation  Front (FMLN).    The joint group "invites all people and entities that may  have any information or are willing to help discover illegal  armed groups with political motivations to come forward so these  groups can be eradicated from our country and prosecuted  according to the law."    It also points out that the "confidentiality of information  provided to the Joint Group for the Investigation of Illegal  Armed Groups with Political Motivations is absolutely  guaranteed."    The group will investigate all criminal actions attributed  to  illegal armed groups committed between 16 January 1992, the date  on which the peace agreements were signed by the government of  President Alfredo Cristiani and the FMLN, and March of the  present year.    Among the members of the Joint Group are: Human Rights  Ombudsman Carlos Molina; Diego Garcia Sayan, chief of the human  rights division of the UN Observer Mission for El Salvador; and  two Salvadoran Government representatives.    Last Thursday, while visiting El Salvador, Brian Atwood,  special envoy of the U.S. State Department, said the U.S.  Government has decided to provide technical and economic support  to the Joint Group for the eradication of illegal armed groups  with political motivations from El Salvador.</p>

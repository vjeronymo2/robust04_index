			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / Westminster City Council approves building scheme Liquid assets: a scheme to build offices, shops and flats at Paddington Basin in west London (above) has won detailed planning permission from Westminster City Council, Vanessa Houlder writes. British Waterways, the public utility which runs the canal system, and Trafalgar House Developments intend to develop the site during the second half of the decade. The completion of the first phase will coincide with the opening of the Heathrow Express, a British Rail line from Paddington to Heathrow Airport, due to open in 1996. The last phase will coincide with the opening of CrossRail, the link between Paddington, Liverpool Street, and eastern England, due to open in 1999. The 13-acre project, designed by Building Design Group and Skidmore Owings &amp; Merrill, is adjacent to Paddington Station and will include 1.2m sq ft of offices, 100,000 sq ft of shops and restaurants, and 236 flats.</p>

			<p><P> January 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: VENICE;  </P> <P> AID FOR HOMELESS OFFERED  </P> <P> A mobile home offering "one-stop shopping" for homeless people in need of  services will be in Venice until Feb. 3.  </P> <P> Program coordinator Patricia Huff said the "Mobile Ombudsman" trailer is  staffed by representatives of local, state and federal agencies who are  available to help needy people obtain aid.  </P> <P> The trailer is parked at 685 N. Venice Blvd. at Pisani Street, where it is open  from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday.  </P> <P> The ombudsman program is an outgrowth of an effort by City Councilwoman Ruth  Galanter and the city's Community Development Department to bring services to  homeless people camping out on Venice Beach two years ago, Huff said in a press  release.  </P> <P> "The 'Mobile Ombudsman' program has been a very effective means of giving the  homeless a chance to escape the streets," Galanter said.  </P> <P> The trailer remains in one location for about a month before moving.  </P> <P> Huff said Pacific Telesis has provided the trailer with phones so needy people  can check on housing, make appointments or check in with their families.  </P> <P> The agencies on duty include the Veterans Administration, the Social Security  Administration, the county Department of Public Social Services and the Mental  Health Department.  </P></p>

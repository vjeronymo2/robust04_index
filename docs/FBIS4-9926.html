			<p>BFN     [Text] The case of the three slain Communist leaders is  reviewed in this Sunday's newspapers. Judge Canovas acted on  firm evidence; he lived up to his reputation as a severe rural  judge. He lived as one who has witnessed a horrendous nightmare,  until he was defeated by a terrible death.    Nevertheless, Special Judge Milton Juica continued the task  started by Canovas through confessions which went beyond the  somber forebodings of the late solitary judge.    This is what Ascanio Cavallo writes in an article [in LA  EPOCA] entitled: "The Doors of Hell":    Few people remember it now, but Carabineros General Rodolfo  Stange tendered his resignation as Carabineros commander once  before. It was on the afternoon of 1 April 1985, almost nine  years ago, when it was reported that Judge Canovas Robles had  just set bail for two Carabineros and indicted 14 others for  their involvement, less than five months previously, in the  abduction and killing of Communist Party leaders Manuel  Guerrero, Santiago Natino, and Jose Manuel Parada.    After reviewing aspects of this case, and the many  harassments of which [former Carabineros Commander] General  Cesar Mendoza was not unaware, Ascanio Cavallo states:    Since then, Stange has done his best to improve the image of  the Carabineros. He dissolved the Diconcar [expansion unknown],  and little by little expelled Carabineros personnel who were  involved in the DINA [National Intelligence Directorate], the  CNI [National Intelligence Center], or in other similar  organizations or had carried out similar duties. He cleaned up  the generals corps, expedited the promotion process, and  established an open-door policy to the public.    Stange ordered the Carabineros to maintain a prudent  low-profile during the plebiscite. He showed a previously  unsuspected ability for political maneuvering during the  transition by accepting the court appointment proposed by  Patricio Aylwin's Administration without yielding almost  anything.    The case of the three Communist leaders was, however,  hopeless. On 31 March, in his much-awaited first ruling, Special  Judge Juica recommended that the military court indict Stange  for serious nonfulfillment of military duties. This goes beyond  the judicial measures that occurred as a result of Mendoza fall  in 1985. Juica's ruling presupposes that the high command did  not conduct the proper investigation and obstructed justice.    Ascanio Cavallo's article in LA EPOCA adds: At least the  attitude of the Carabineros has changed throughout the process.    Canovas lived under surveillance and his credibility was  subjected to continuous challenge while conducting the  investigation. Many high-ranking officers systematically  refused to accept that some of their men may have been involved  in the homicide case, but tolerated the repeated lies from those  responsible.    Only in 1992, when Juica's investigation had yielded the  first irrefutable evidence, did one high-ranking officer,  General Mario Morales, publicly express his shame. The  admonitions to which he was subjected and the isolation he was  forced to endure, compelled him to resign by the end of 1993.    Continuing its analysis on this case, the "Doors of Hells"  adds: Subjected to these complex pressures, it has become  difficult for Stange to exercise his command. Subtlety is not  required to understand that the government wants Stange to  resign. During a meeting that lasted more than two hours at  President Frei's office on the afternoon of 31 March, the  political team gave the Carabineros the long Easter weekend to  decide. But the phrase urging Gen. Stange to conscientiously  analyze the situation -- which was included in the communique  that ensued from this meeting -- leaves virtually no room for  doubt. It would be very difficult to find a case where the  executive branch has appealed to the conscience of someone and  have him remain in his post.    The defense used by the Carabineros high command on 1 April  is more aimed at the groups that requested Stange's resignation  than at the government's statement.    Nevertheless, the statement issued by the Carabineros high  command could not have appeased the executive branch. The  circumstances under which it was read -- with all the  Carabineros generals standing behind Carabineros Deputy  Commander Fernando Cordero who read the statement -- insinuated  that the Carabineros would react as an institution, as they did  in 1985 when the high command made it perfectly clear it could  only be led by one of its own.    Therefore, the past few hours have served to establish if  this statement has the approval of Gen. Stange, or if it is a  noble but unrealistic gesture of solidarity.    The article ends by noting: The Carabineros high command  believes charges of the involvement of its commander are partial  and biased, but one cannot overlook the fact that the main  conclusion of these charges is based on an independent  investigation conducted over nine years by two special judges.    Who is going to confirm if these are biased and partial  opinions? The military courts, for example, may decide there is  no merit in holding a trial after such a long period or in  holding a trial in which the Carabineros may be interested  parties.    Whether or not Stange remains in his post is not a judicial  question; it is strictly a political case. It has nothing to do  with his work in modernizing Carabineros. Stange has the last  word and, until he utters it, it is easy to predict the  prevailing atmosphere: Tense, very tense.</p>

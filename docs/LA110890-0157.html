			<p><P> November 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EDUCATION;  </P> <P> POOR EATING AND EXERCISE HABITS SPELL DECLINING STUDENT FITNESS  </P> <P> With the profusion of gyms, bike paths and health food stores found on the  Westside, you might expect local students to be trim, fit and active. But  recent fitness tests by the respected California Assessment Program show that  our children are just the opposite.  </P> <P> More than 900,000 California students took fitness tests that included sit-ups,  pull-ups, a mile run, a sit-and-reach flexibility test and an optional body-fat  measurement. Only 21% of seventh-graders and 26% of ninth-graders were able to  meet four of the five requirements.  </P> <P> Locally, the results were even worse. In Los Angeles County, only 17% of  seventh-graders and 19% of ninth-graders satisfied four of the five  requirements.  </P> <P> Local physical fitness teachers are not surprised by the CAP results. They  agree that fitness and health among teen-agers are declining, and they cite two  causes: lack of exercise and a poor diet.  </P> <P> Mitchell Miller, a fitness teacher at Marina del Rey Junior High School,  contends that television is the greatest temptation away from exercise.  "They're not getting involved in activities outside school as much as they used  to," he said. "Now they just go home and watch TV."  </P> <P> My own students seem to fit this trend toward inertia. Only three of the 19  students on my school newspaper staff said that they exercise regularly. But  those who did not blamed school work -- not television -- as the main obstacle  to exercising. "I don't really have time for it because I always have so much  homework," said Liza Potter, 15.  </P> <P> It seems that students' eating habits are as harmful as their exercise habits.  The main source of teens' dietary problems are the fast-food chain restaurants  that surround many schools, Santa Monica High School basketball coach Debbie  Skaggs contends. "The kids are eating too many high-cholesterol foods,  fattening foods and fried foods," she said.  </P> <P> Most public junior and senior high schools allow students to leave campus at  lunchtime. As a result, the students often eat their largest meal of the day at  a hamburger or fried chicken stand.  </P> <P> Despite these negative influences, however, parents can still help their  children shape up with a few simple and inexpensive steps.  </P> <P> Begin by purifying your child's diet. "They need more of the basics," said  Steve Gould, Miller's colleague at Marina del Rey Junior High. "Give them more  carbohydrates like potatoes, bread, rice, beans and pasta."  </P> <P> Skaggs agreed. She recommended a diet that included fruit and a good cereal for  breakfast, and lean meat, such as chicken, for dinner. Above all, "stay away  from fried foods," she said.  </P> <P> Encourage your child to avoid fast-food lunches by packing a decent bag lunch.  Surprisingly, my students said that a good homemade lunch would actually keep  them out of burger joints.  </P> <P> "I start out the day wanting to eat right," said Rob Baker, 16, "but if there's  nothing at home to pack for lunch, I always end up eating fast food."  </P> <P> Keep a bowl of fruit on or near the television since, like it or not, your  child probably spends a lot of time there. No-mess fruit, such as apples or  bananas, are most attractive because they're easy to grab and eat.  </P> <P> In most cases, it would be a losing battle to try to eliminate sweets, but  sweets can be minimized without undue stress. Ration the junk food as though it  were spending money. Instead of just leaving an open box of cookies in the  cabinet, hide it in a safe place and distribute the sweets after dinner.  </P> <P> Once the diet is on track, help your child vent some of that new energy by  making an exercise program. "It just takes 30 minutes a day, three times a  week," said Skaggs. "That's not much."  </P> <P> "Take an active part," suggested Gould, "and show them that you care about  exercise too." Bike riding, bowling, jogging or just walking after dinner can  be pleasant parent-child activities.  </P> <P> Enroll your child in a sports program at a nearby park. Most city programs  offer a variety of sports, including basketball, swimming, volleyball and  softball. These programs are usually free or inexpensive.  </P> <P> If it's financially feasible, try the YMCA, which is popular among the teens  who do exercise. "They have weight machines to build muscles and a Stairmaster  for cardiovascular health," noted Kim Einhorn, 17. The YMCA also offers  swimming and gymnastics lessons, basketball and other sports.  </P> <P> Pop Warner football, Little League baseball and Bobby Sox softball are old  favorites, of course, but not all neighborhoods have these programs, and  equipment costs can run $100 or more per season.  </P> <P> Starting your child on a fresh diet and exercise program may seem drastic and  time-consuming. But consider the alternative. "Twenty years from now," Skaggs  predicts, "I think there's going to be a higher rate of heart disease. (These  kids) will be obese adults who are having a lot of heart attacks, and that's  sad because we now have the facilities and knowledge to prevent that."  </P></p>

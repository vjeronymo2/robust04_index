			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / Trustees win backing for pensions test case THE government has agreed in principle to provide financial backing for pension scheme trustees in a test case on pensions equality. It is hoped that the test case, involving the Coloroll Group Pension Schemes, will resolve ambiguities arising from a European Court judgment last year. That ruled that benefits paid from occupational pension schemes counted as pay under Article 119 of the Treaty of Rome and therefore had to be equal for men and women. However, the judgment - in the Barber v Guardian Royal Exchange case - stated that to avoid upsetting the financial balance of schemes, it would only apply to pension entitlements arising after May 17 1990 - the date of the judgment. The confusion arose over whether that related only to the benefits secured by contributions made after May 17, or to the date when the pension payments started, or to all pension payments after May 17. It is intended to bring the case before the High Court within weeks and have it referred to the European Court within 18 months. A favourable interpretation could mean minimal initial cost to pensions schemes, but the cost rises to about Pounds 30bn on the most unfavourable interpretation. Coloroll Group went into administrative receivership a few weeks after the judgment.</p>

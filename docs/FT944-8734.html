			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / Leading Article: Hollywood woes With the predictability of a Hollywood plot, the Japanese invasion of US film-making five years ago is now generating pages of red ink. Yesterday, Sony Corporation announced that writedowns of Y265.2bn (Dollars 2.7bn) at its Columbia Pictures subsidiary, acquired five years ago for Dollars 3.4bn, would pull the whole group into loss for this financial year. The announcement raises several questions of strategy, pertinent also to Matsushita's Dollars 6.1bn takeover of MCA, owner of Universal Pictures. First, how does the principle of integrating technology and programming look now? The trigger for Sony's move into programming was the battle over standards for videocassette recorders. Sony's Betamax format, arguably technically superior, lost to VHS for lack of available programming. Sony learnt, painfully, that customers watch programmes not technology, and concluded that it must buy a studio to safeguard new products. The conclusion was wrong, however. Although Sony argues that sales of its new MiniDisc portable audio products have been aided by its ownership of CBS records, ensuring that recordings are available to play on them, there are few other examples to support its case. The flaw in the reasoning is that no company has a large enough share of the music or video markets to launch a new consumer product; Sony Pictures, which includes Columbia, has only 10 per cent of the US box office. If vertical integration is worthless, can Japanese management add value to a Hollywood studio? The quick answer, judging by the bottom line, is no. Moreover, there are good reasons for longer-term scepticism, given the culture clashes between technology and programming companies, and between Japanese hierarchies and Hollywood egos. Assessed, then, simply as an investment in programming, how does the deal look now? Too expensive, clearly. But there is some consolation in that Columbia's value may now rise, as the explosion of channels and services in the US and Europe is increasing demand for programming. Should Sony and Matsushita take advantage of the media revolution by an alternative strategy: buying channels to distribute the programmes? Both have invested recently in cable and satellite. The value of those link-ups can be questioned, but they are more promising than a marriage of technology and programming. No such strategy will be successful, however, if the programmes are not popular enough. Of all the messages in Sony's statement, that is the loudest.</p>

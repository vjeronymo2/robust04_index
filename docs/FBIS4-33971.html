			<p>BFN     [Text] Finance Minister Julio Sosa Rodriguez has admitted  in London, without providing details, Venezuela is holding talks  with the IMF, but he has explained his country has yet to  request a "standby" [previous word published in English]  agreement.    During his visit to London, Sosa seized the opportunity to  meet with representatives of the British private and public  sectors, as well as with the media, in what could be considered  an instructive offensive aimed at projecting a clearer image of  the country's prevailing situation.    He announced IMF President Michael Camdessus will visit  Venezuela in late June, adding the country has enough reserves  to pay for 11 months worth of imports and to meet foreign debt  obligations.    During his meeting with media representatives, Sosa not only  delineated the economic measures the country is taking; he also  listened to and answered questions, stressing "the distortions  that can be made due to a lack of information and preconceived  notions." He left the doors open for future consultations.    The finance minister added: "The possibility that Venezuela  has to achieve self-sustained economic growth requires time,  despite good intentions and determination; this time must be  used to invest in political stability and social justice."    Sosa also reported the British company Baywater will sign an  agreement with the Venezuelan Government to repair the  metropolitan aqueduct, which will not only regulate the water  supply to Caracas but will also constitute a large boost for the  "Venezuela Project," through which the British private sector  will invest more than $2 billion in the country.</p>

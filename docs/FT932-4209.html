			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / Leading Article: Toothless allies IT WOULD have sounded unduly pessimistic, as recently as a few weeks ago, to predict that the disarray among western countries over what to do in Bosnia-Hercegovina could get any worse. It has. As the fighting between Moslems, Serbs and Croats has flared again in recent days, the international community has plumbed new depths of incoherence. Yet the western powers persist in pretending, against all the evidence, that they are serious about intervening - if not to keep the peace process on track, at least to afford some protection to the victims. Events have proved that threats without the will or means to back them up are not just futile; they fuel the fighting and put a settlement even further out of reach. The mess was on full display at yesterday's EC meeting in Athens. The Vance-Owen peace plan is as good as dead, with neither the European Community nor the US showing any sign of more than rhetorical readiness to resuscitate it. Sanctions on Serbia are not being supplemented as they should be by similar measures against Croatia, nor by a serious effort to choke off supply routes to the Bosnian Serbs by placing monitors on Serbia's western border. Worse, even the meagre plan adopted as a short-term substitute - aimed at setting up UN-protected 'safe areas' for Moslem communities - looks still-born, since none of the countries that blithely agreed on the idea in Washington last month seems ready to provide the forces needed to put it into practice. All sides carry some blame. The Clinton administration - by dithering, half-heartedly presenting a plan to arm the Moslems and strike at the Serbs, and then just as hesitantly withdrawing it - arguably helped to kill off Vance-Owen without producing anything substantial in its place. European governments - by failing to elaborate a credible way of building on the existing, and decreasingly effective, UN relief effort - have undermined the idea that anything useful can be achieved by external forces. The US, by refusing to provide troops to help establish safe areas, has left a gap which other UN member states will find it nigh impossible to fill. There is, of course, nothing glorious about the safe areas idea. At best, it will create protected pockets of misery in Bosnia for a community that once formed 40 per cent of the ravaged republic's population, and that only for as long as western countries are prepared to keep their troops on the ground. But at least implementation of the plan would demonstrate western commitment to securing a place for the Moslems in the Bosnia that will have to be reconstructed from today's ruins. Failure to provide the extra troops necessary for this bare minimum of a strategy will not just leave UN forces already deployed in Bosnia vulnerable to attack; it will be tantamount to western acquiescence in complete partition of the republic between Serbs and Croats.</p>

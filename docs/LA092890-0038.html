			<p><P> September 28, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MUSIC &amp; DANCE  </P> <P> ABT After Baryshnikov: American Ballet Theatre's plans for its 1990-91 season  include replacing three stagings by former artistic director Mikhail  Baryshnikov, who withdrew rights to his works when he quit abruptly last year  in an angry dispute with current co-director Jane Hermann. In place of the  Baryshnikov versions formerly in the repertory, ABT has commissioned a new  staging of the full-length "Don Quixote" (from Bolshoi luminary Vladimir  Vasiliev), a new suite of "Raymonda" excerpts (from dancer Fernando Bujones)  and a restaging of the full-length "Giselle" (from someone not yet announced).

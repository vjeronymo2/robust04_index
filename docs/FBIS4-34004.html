"It is not possible to advance with inefficient, isolated  economies, nor is it possible with internationalized economies  that are socially irresponsible," Salinas de Gortari added.  According to Salinas de Gortari, "we must insist that economic  recovery go hand in hand with social reforms."    Salinas de Gortari said that he views with optimism  bilateral  and multilateral trade agreements signed during the past few  years by countries of the American Continent because "free trade  and the just exchange of goods and capital will benefit all of  us." In addition, he called for a more active presence of  Ibero-American countries in international organizations, and  particularly mentioned the World Trade Organization,  (?affiliated to GATT), which he hopes to chair.    Salinas de Gortari expressed his solidarity with Colombia  over the natural disaster that affected the regions of Cauca and  Huila last week, which caused more than 1,000 deaths. He also  congratulated his Colombian counterpart and host, Cesar Gaviria,  for his election this year as the new OAS secretary general.    Salinas de Gortari delivered his speech at the inauguration  of the Fourth Ibero-American Summit, which was delayed six hours  because most of the heads of state and government attending the  event used double and even triple the amount of time they were  expected to use (seven minutes each).</p>

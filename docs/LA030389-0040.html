			<p><P> March 3, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL PLAYOFFS;  </P> <P> BOYS' DIVISION V;  </P> <P> IN LONG HAUL, CALIPATRIA IS A TITLE TEAM  </P> <P> After stepping on the court together five times this season, Calipatria and  Imperial high schools from the Desert League traveled about 120 miles Thursday  for a sixth meeting.  </P> <P> Of course, the site was a bigger than usual -- the San Diego Sports Arena. And  the stakes were higher -- the San Diego Section Division V boys' basketball  championship.  </P> <P> But the Calipatria whammy was still in place. The Hornets won, 56-45, to earn  their second consecutive Division V title and fifth victory over Imperial this  season.  </P> <P> "It's a natural rivalry for the kids," Calipatria Coach Wallace Williams said.  "Our kids get more pumped up when they play Imperial."  </P> <P> Especially 120 miles from home, in a championship game in the Sports Arena. And  particularly when Calipatria (17-7) was seeded No. 4 and Imperial (13-10) No. 2  in the tournament despite their regular-season meetings.  </P> <P> The tone was set early for Calipatria, when Vince Coleman nailed two  three-point shots in the first quarter to help the Hornets to a 16-12 lead.  </P> <P> It continued through the second quarter, when a full-court press helped  Calipatria increase its lead to 28-18 at halftime.  </P> <P> By the end of the third quarter, Calipatria had a 44-29 lead, and it was all  over.  </P> <P> Coleman led Calipatria with 17 points, Mike Moss had 15 and Enrique Barraza 13.  </P> <P> "Coach told me to shoot if I had the open shot, so I did," said Coleman, a  5-foot-10 senior. "The first three-pointer I hit, I didn't even know I was in  three-point territory."  </P> <P> The Calipatria press forced 17 Imperial turnovers, but Imperial coach Kerry  Legarra pointed to missed free throws as the difference in the game. Imperial  made just five of 13 attempts, a bad enough percentage made worse by the fact  that seven of its misses were the front ends of one-and-ones.  </P> <P> "They outplayed us and outhustled us," Legarra said. "The game was lost at the  free-throw line."  </P> <P> Brian Williams scored 12 points for Imperial, which played without 6-foot-5  center Fabian Diaz. The Desert League's most valuable player this season, Diaz  averaged 15 points and 11 rebounds a game. He sprained an ankle in Imperial's  semifinal victory over Marian.  </P></p>

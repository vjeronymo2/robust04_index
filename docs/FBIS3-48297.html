The report, set to spell out the terms of  how to "significantly increase" foreign access and sales to key  Japanese markets, is due to be completed by the February 11  summit between President Bill Clinton and Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa.    "We are still in the midst of negotiations," said a Japanese  official who briefed reporters on the day's plenary session  between Japanese and U.S. principals in charge of the framework  negotiations.    The Japanese spokesman said the two sides agreed not to  discuss matters of substance before the current round of trade  talks is over, possibly by Wednesday. "Each side presented a  status report, and we exchanged views," the official said.    There were, however, indications that there was no  significant breakthrough. "We still have a lot of work to do,"  Deputy U.S. Treasury Secretary Roger Altman told after emerging  from the day's session at the White House conference center.    A U.S. official who gave a separate briefing to Japanese  reporters said the day's talks focused on the issue of  "objective criteria," the heart of contention between Tokyo and  Washington. "There is still a big gap between us here," said  the official, who made a point of conducting the briefing in  Japanese.    The United States, which runs a 50 billion dollar trade  deficit with Japan, has insisted that Japan accept the import  levels of other industrial countries as the norm that it must  emulate. Japanese officials have rejected the U.S. demand,  arguing that setting import targets is anathema to free trade.    U.S. Commerce Secretary Ron Brown said Monday the U.S. will  insist on taking "a targeted, results-oriented approach" in  seeking trade concessions from Tokyo.    "I think that is going to make a real difference" in U.S.  trade ties with Japan, Brown said at a news conference.    The meeting between the high-powered U.S. delegation and  Japanese negotiators came a day after U.S. Treasury Secretary  Lloyd Bentsen warned Tokyo that Washington may reexamine the  basis of trade relations with Japan if no breakthrough is made  in the framework trade talks.    Laura Tyson, head of the White House Council of Economic  Advisers, was also at the negotiation table Monday.    Tyson told reporters after the meeting that she was taking  part in the trade talks as an observer. "This is an area I have  given a lot of thought about," said Tyson, who has written a  book on trade conflicts in high-technology industries between  Japan and the U.S.    The U.S. negotiating team also included Ezra Vogel, a  leading  Japan expert and a senior official of the Central Intelligence  Agency's National Intelligence Council.    The Japanese negotiating team, headed by Deputy Foreign  Minister Koichiro Matsuura, included officials from the Foreign  Ministry, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, and  the Finance Ministry.</p>

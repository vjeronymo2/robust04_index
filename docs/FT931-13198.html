			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / International Company News: Better return from small companies INVESTMENTS in small companies are likely to outperform those in their larger counterparts, according to two new surveys. According to stockbrokers Hoare Govett, who compile the Hoare Govett Smaller Companies Index, prices are expected to rise by 20 per cent in the coming year, outperforming the anticipated rise in the FTSE index of only 12.4 per cent. Meanwhile, accountants Stoy Hayward, who compile their own Private Company Price Index - which largely consists of smaller companies - found that prices paid to acquire smaller companies rose steadily relative to earnings during 1992, a trend expected to continue into 1993. The average price paid for a private company in the UK was 9.5 times earnings in the fourth quarter last year, against 8.3 times in the comparative period of 1991. At the end of 1992, the Private Company Index stood at a 43 per cent discount to price/earnings ratio of the FT 500 - the widest level in recent years - highlighting the differences in sentiment between investors in leading quoted companies and those in the smaller company sector. Mr Rick Sopher, corporate finance partner at Stoy Hayward, said current price anomalies make it very attractive for small private companies to be acquired by quoted ones. Institutional shareholders, however, have been unwilling to support the acquisition ambitions of smaller quoted companies, so they are losing out on the chance to bolster earnings through relatively low-cost acquisitions. Meanwhile, research from Hoare Govett shows that the smaller companies sector in December 1992 turned in the best performance since June 1987. The Small Companies Index has risen by 28 per cent since last September's Black Wednesday, well ahead of the 16 per cent rise in the FTSE 100. Since the beginning of September, the FTSE has fallen 1.5 per cent while the HGSCI has risen 14.3 per cent.</p>

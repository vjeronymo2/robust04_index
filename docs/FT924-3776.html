			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / International Company News: KIO Spanish arm calls in receivers GRUPO TORRAS, the Spanish investment arm of the Kuwait Investment Office, filed for receivership in Madrid yesterday, bringing to an end a six-year investment spree in Spain which the KIO's newly installed management claims has left it with losses of Dollars 4bn. Mr Mahmoud al-Nouri, who was appointed chairman of Torras in June, said the results of an investigation into the past management of the group were much worse than expected and had shattered the KIO's plans to revive Torras, 'regrettably forcing us to change our strategy'. The receivership affects only Torras and not its surviving industrial affiliates. Two partners in KPMG Peat Marwick, which audits some KIO funds and which led the investigation, were appointed special representatives at Torras. A Madrid court will name receivers. Mr al-Nouri would not say what Torras's liabilities were but confirmed that the KIO had outstanding credits worth between Dollars 1.5bn and Dollars 2.5bn with Torras, making it the group's biggest creditor. A statement circulated at a press conference blamed the former management of the KIO and Torras for 'mismanagement on a massive scale' and of 'apparent misappropriation' of funds. Mr John Fordham, a partner in Stephenson Harwood, the KIO legal advisers, claimed the office had lost Dollars 2bn in Spain in share dealing, Dollars 700m in share support schemes and Dollars 600m in short-term financing. He would not say how. The Dollars 2bn share losses may simply be the difference between the price of shares Torras bought in industrial companies and their lower prices now. Mr Jose Maria Stampa Braun, a trial lawyer contracted to design charges against the former Torras board, told the press conference he was still not sure who would be charged or what charges would be made. Mr Javier de la Rosa, the Catalan financier who ran Torras for the KIO until last May and who the new management alleges is responsible for problems at Torras, said later that the KIO was running away from its responsibilities in Spain. 'I can prove that the only beneficiary (of the money spent in Spain) is the KIO itself.' The KIO's 'auditors, advisers, the KIO and Kuwait itself will learn that the people involved in irregularities, illegalities and suspicious activities are themselves and not the old board of Torras', Mr de la Rosa said. The Spanish government has strongly opposed receivership at Torras and there was still a measure of doubt yesterday as to whether a court will actually approve the receivership. Some legal observers argue that since Torras is wholly-owned by the office it is a sovereign agency and as such is capable of meeting its financial obligations in Spain.</p>

			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / Irish gas pipeline deal signed CONTRACTS were signed in Dublin yesterday for the construction of a IPounds 236m (Pounds 220m) gas pipeline which for the first time will make North Sea gas supplies available to the Irish Republic, Tim Coone writes. The pipeline will run under the Irish Sea from Moffat, Dumfries and Galloway to a point north of Dublin. The European Community is supporting the project with IPounds 83m through its Regen programme, which is aimed at extending electricity and gas networks to remoter parts of the community. EPTM, a UK-French consortium, is to build the 140-mile pipeline, British Steel will provide the pipes and Wood-Bredero, a UK-Irish consortium, is to provide pipe coatings and protection.</p>

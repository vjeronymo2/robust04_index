			<p><P> October 10, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN LEAGUE NOTES;  </P> <P> A'S ECKERSLEY PREVAILS AGAINST EVANS ONCE AGAIN  </P> <P> It was not, Dennis Eckersley said with the hint of a smile Tuesday, a pointed  effort to show up Dwight Evans.  </P> <P> That is what Evans said the Oakland Athletics' relief ace was doing Sunday  night when he exultantly pumped his right arm after striking out the Boston Red  Sox's designated hitter on three pitches with two out and two on in the eighth  inning of American League playoff Game 2.  </P> <P> These two former teammates met again in the ninth inning of Game 3, and Evans  struck out again as the leadoff hitter, unable to check his swing on a high  fastball with the count full.  </P> <P> Eckersley reacted by pointing the index finger of his right hand toward the  plate. A television close-up of Evans as he walked away showed him saying, " .  . . you."  </P> <P> At his locker later, Eckersley said he couldn't help but think of the events of  Sunday.  </P> <P> "But I didn't want to make him mad, and I didn't want to walk him, either,"  Eckersley said. "He swung at a ball out of the strike zone, and I pointed at  the checked swing. I meant no offense to him, believe me. Of course, I'm having  more fun than Dewey because I keep striking him out."  </P> <P> Evans attempted to out-wait reporters in the Boston clubhouse later, having an  attendant bring his clothes into the trainer's room, but he finally emerged and  said:  </P> <P> "Again, I have great admiration for him. Naturally, in that situation I wanted  a piece of him, but there's nothing going on between us. Really, I just don't  want to talk about it."  </P> <P> Eckersley has 10 saves for his postseason career, a record. His second of this  series broke a tie with Rollie Fingers. Eckersley has appeared in all 11 of the  A's victories in the last three playoffs and has allowed only one earned run in  15 playoff innings.  </P> <P> Before being caught trying to steal third base in the seventh inning Tuesday,  Rickey Henderson was 14 for 14 on the bases in postseason play. Henderson has  11 playoff steals and three in the World Series. He also has an 11-game  postseason hitting streak.  </P> <P> "I'm mad in a way about losing my (stealing) streak," Henderson said. "It meant  a lot. I shouldn't really have been running then."  </P> <P> Dave Stewart, today's Oakland starter, is 9-0 in his last 10 starts against  Boston since Aug. 19, 1988.  </P> <P> With a 4-0 playoff record, he's tied with six other pitchers for the most  victories in playoff history.  </P> <P> Jose Canseco will skip batting practice today to spare his right hand further  injury. He has been bothered by a jammed middle finger on his right hand, which  has caused pain that radiates back into his palm.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Helene Elliott contributed to this story.  </P></p>

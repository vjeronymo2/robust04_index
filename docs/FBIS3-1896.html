THE NEW YORK TIMES quoted senior U.S. officials as saying  the  President had accepted the recommendation from his economic  advisers that he reinstate by executive order the "Super 301"  trade retaliation mechanism.    Since the U.S.-Japan summit meeting failed to reach a trade  agreement two weeks ago, the U.S. Administration has been  considering measures to compel Japan to open markets for U.S.  products.    "Super 301", passed by Congress in 1988, requires the U.S.  trade representatives to identify the countries that maintain  the most egregious trade barriers and to use the legislation to  eliminate those barriers.    If an offending country refuses to eliminate the specific  barriers, the U.S. president has the authority to retaliate by  blocking an equivalent amount of that country's exports to the  United States.    These officials said the President still intended to move  cautiously and simply signing the executive order did not mean  that he would use it against Japan immediately.    But some analysts argued that putting such a powerful weapon  into place could mark a dangerous increase in U.S.-Japan trade  tensions.    Reacting to THE NEW YORK TIME's report, a spokesman of  Japanese Government said today that such a move would be  "counterproductive" and urged the United States to use a  "sensible" approach to the trade question.</p>

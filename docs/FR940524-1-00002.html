This action is not intended to have retroactive effect. This rule would not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. There are no administrative procedures which must be exhausted prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions of this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Administrator, Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), has certified that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, as defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act, Public Law 96&hyph;354 (5 U.S.C. 601).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rule reflects fee increases needed to recover the costs of services rendered in accordance with the Agricultural Marketing Act (AMA) of 1946. The inspection, grading and certification program for processed fruits and vegetables and related products is voluntary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The AMA authorizes official inspection, grading, and certification on a user-fee basis, of processed food products including processed fruits, vegetables, and processed products made from them. The AMA provides that reasonable fees be collected from the user of the program services to cover as nearly as practicable the costs of services rendered. This proposal would amend the schedule of fees and charges for inspection, grading, and certification services to more nearly reflect the costs currently associated with the program. The amendment would include the addition of the new Section 52.47 pertaining to charges when service is canceled or changed in order to manage the program in the most cost effective manner. Former &sect;52.47, which was removed, pertained to microbiological and other types of testing functions which were transferred to the AMS Science Division.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AMS regularly reviews its programs to determine if fees are adequate. Employee salary and fringe benefits are major program costs that account for approximately 85 percent of the total operating budget. Two salary increases for Federal employees, a 3.7 percent pay increase effective January 10, 1993, and a locality pay increase, ranging from 3.09 to 6.52 percent depending upon locality, effective January 8, 1994, have materially affected program costs. Unemployment insurance, FTS 2000 telecommunications, General Services Administration rent, and other administrative, supervisory, and program costs have also increased.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the Agricultural Appropriation Bill for fiscal year 1994 directed AMS to establish a user fee program to recover the costs associated with agricultural commodities quality standards. In response, the service has implemented cost-cutting actions (reorganization and/or downsizing of field offices and technical support services) which reduced obligations by $569,175 from FY&hyph;92 to FY&hyph;93. Nonetheless, despite these measures, the Agency has determined that due to the increases in program operating costs, an increase in fees is necessary to meet rising costs and prevent financial losses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the Agency's analysis of increased costs since 1993, AMS proposes to increase the fees relating to such services as shown in the following table. The table compares current fees and charges with proposed fees and charges for processed fruit and vegetable inspection as found in 7 CFR 52.42&hyph;52.51. For inspection services charged under &sect;52.42, overtime and holiday work would continue to be charged as provided in that section. For inspection services charged on a contract basis under section 52.51 overtime work would also continue to be charged as provided in that section. Unless otherwise provided for by regulation or written agreement between the applicant and the Administrator, the charges in the schedule of fees as found in &sect;52.42 are:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

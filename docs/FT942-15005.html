			<p>940418 FT  18 APR 94 / Management: Another string to their bow - Arts managers in search of business skills One minute Felix Warnock was playing bassoon in the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment. The next he was running it. As general manager he found himself drawing up business plans, budgets and new management structures. It was a far cry from baroque music. The arts is full of people like Warnock, who clamber into management by virtue of being good bassoonists, singers, actors. While lawyers and accountants also become senior managers on the basis of their skills as practitioners, they tend to be better prepared for their new responsibilities. Arts managers are expected to adapt to their new jobs without outside help. The business school route is closed to them. The cost of a one-week course, around Pounds 2,500, could make the difference for some arts companies between profit and loss. Business in the Arts is attempting to fill the gap with a scheme, sponsored by English Estates, for sending arts managers on management courses. So far nearly 50 managers have been put through the mill, and are now attempting to apply business school recipes to their dance groups, orchestras, theatres, galleries and museums. Budget reductions over the last decade have meant that arts organisations have needed all the management skills on offer. 'There has been a revolution in the last 10 years. No one in the arts is owed a living anymore,' says Barbara Woroncow, director of Yorkshire and Humberside Museums. 'We all need training. Most of us are handling public money. If people had better training they could make better use of the money.' One might have expected some mutual culture shock in plunging an arts manager into the sterile world of the business school. For a start they talk a different language: the average arts manager has never heard of total quality management, and has little idea of what a stakeholder is. Meanwhile, their counterparts in business have no conception of the realities of running a museum or opera company. 'For the first few days I was definitely regarded as an oddity,' says Warnock, who attended the Leadership in Management course at Sundridge Park, Kent. Ian Ritchie, general manager of Opera North, felt that colleagues on his course at Ashridge 'didn't see how somebody like me was actually running a serious business'. But by the end of the week, the similarities between arts companies and a regular business appeared more remarkable than the differences. On the Making Change Work programme, Ritchie and his course-mates agreed that the problems of managing change were similar whether they were selling reinsurance or putting on operas. On the leadership course it emerged that the difficulties of motivating people are the same whether they are musicians or bank clerks. 'The issues they raise are very similar,' says Susan Segal-Horn at the Cranfield School of Management. 'Arts companies need to be able to manage downsizing and outsourcing, to decide where to invest resources and, above all, manage short-term and long-term strategic change. These issues are bog standard. They are the same for Marks &amp; Spencer, for transportation companies, for everyone.' Many arts managers, though, believe their problems are especially tricky. Ritchie argues that Opera North is as complex as a multinational, although he employs only 160 people and has a turnover of just Pounds 9m. He says the financial constraints are especially onerous. 'People were amazed that my annual objective is to achieve breakeven. A swing of 1 per cent means missing the target by Pounds 80,000. Others said they did not have targets that tight.' As well as confirming how difficult their jobs were, the courses provided the arts managers with some concrete help. Woroncow claims to have returned from her strategic management course at Cranfield 'with a missionary zeal'. Her first action was to commission Leeds University Business School to do a customer relations survey of her 180 client museums. She then tore up the existing corporate plan, which she saw to be a muddle of aspirations, and replaced it with precise measurable targets. Next, she signed up for Investors in People. Finally, she took her staff through the exercises she had learnt. 'The course helped me to think in a structured way of the business environment. I had lots of information, but didn't have the tool kit to analyse where changes were coming from, and which were the most important in the short, medium and long term.' Warnock, who since the course has moved sideways to the new position of arts administrator, says his main lesson was the need to listen harder to the views of his colleagues. Ritchie is still hoping to find time to go through the wad of paper he accumulated on the course. Some of the arts managers felt they taught their business colleagues a thing or two. 'The others found my presence refreshing,' says Ritchie. 'I was talking about change in organic terms. One can be very theoretical about techniques of making things happen, but can lose sight of the structure as a fluid thing.' While all enjoyed their week's immersion, they are wary of any trend to elevate general skills of management above those of creativity. Warnock warns that 'management training can be destructive if it is too narrow. There are very few people at London Business School who understand how an orchestra really works. You need 60 people to play a Beethoven symphony. It would seem logical to pare it down, but you can't'</p>

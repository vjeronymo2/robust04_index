			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Books: An odd mismatch made in heaven THE MARRIED MAN: A LIFE OF DH LAWRENCE by Brenda Maddox Sinclair-Stevenson Pounds 20, 631 pages FRIEDA LAWRENCE by Rosie Jackson Pandora Pounds 14.99, 240 pages Lady Ida Sitwell describes a Chiantishire luncheon to her son Osbert in 1926: 'A Mr DH Lawrence came over the other day, a funny little petit-maitre of a man with flat features and a beard. He is a writer, and seems to know of you. His wife is a large German . . .' Lawrence would be dead within four years, Frieda in 30. It was - though Lady Ida would never know - one of the most extraordinary and extravagant marriages in the history of literature. Brenda Maddox has written a most readable account, not so much of Lawrence as of his marriage - 'a mismatch made in heaven', as she puts it. She starts from her response to 'a likeable Lawrence: a devastating mimic, an inspired teacher, a handy householder, a hard-working journalist, a loyal brother and generous uncle, a good cook, an eager traveller and brilliant travel writer, a dogged, dreadful painter, an ecological visionary and, above all - as he saw himself - a married man'. That said, she does not ignore the rest of the portrait: the appalling tensions within the marriage, the alarming anti-democratic political instincts, the sexual problems which were evaded with sodomy, the cruel selfishness which denied Frieda her children. 'Lawrence's real vices were ambivalence, grandiloquence and irascibility' says Maddox, and later, in compensation, quotes Edward Garnett on the man's 'lovableness, cheekiness, intensity and pride'. Unlike the host of earlier books about Lawrence, this one is extremely brisk about the childhood; even Jessie Chambers scarcely figures. After Lawrence's euthanasia-killing of his beloved mother, the focus is on Frieda Weekley. Born a Von Richthoven, she was a member of a liberated and intellectual German family - Maddox is good on pre-war Munich where Frieda's most influential lover, Otto Gross, was a disciple of Freud and a morphine addict. Frieda, after 13 years in a boring Nottingham marriage, did not hesitate to appoint herself the 27-year-old writer's erotic muse, a role which, with the exception of the war years, would keep them out of Britain: 'In their contempt for the stupefying hypocrisy of England, with its concern for appearances and its deep shame about the body, they were as one, and in their odd alliance they were refusing to collaborate in it any longer'. This is a literary biography which does not make the common mistake of under-esteeming the literature (Maddox is interesting, for instance, on St Mawr, and on the curious parallels between a Lawrence story The Shadow in the Rose Garden and Joyce's earlier The Dead), but a book about a marriage has to tackle the detail of that relationship. It was, we are assured, a sexually ill-matched association: 'Anal sex seems to have been the Lawrences' resolution to the conflict between them'. Then there was the matter of Lawrence's possible homosexual leanings - 'Lawrence was not like Forster, a suppressed homosexual who did not have the courage of his desires . . . He was a hypersensitive man unable to bring together the male and female components of his personality, and in the grip of a terror of losing the boundaries of self'. There may have been one homosexual episode in 1917 with a farmer friend, just as there was one known adultery, with Rosalind Baynes; after that there would be impotence - guess who was the model for Sir Clifford Chatterley] None of which damages Lawrence's importance to all of us. 'My great religion is a belief in the blood, the flesh, as being wiser than the intellect. We can go wrong in our minds. But what our blood feels and believes and says, is always true', wrote Lawrence in a famous - notorious - remark. We can deny it, we can be rude about him and, if we wish, his fat German wife, but we cannot pretend to be beyond his influence. There is of course much else of interest and value in this long, deeply-researched history. New Mexico, Mexico, Australia (Kangaroo as 'the most under-appreciated and biographically provocative of any of his novels'), the supreme travel writing (Sea and Sardinia after an eight-day visit]), Lady Chatterley ('God forbid that I should be taken as urging loose sex activity' wrote Lawrence to Lady Ottoline Morrell - too late, of course). My only regret is that we do not have more letters, which Maddox rightly explains is what makes her like him. Consider, for instance, a 1922 letter to Forster, not mentioned here - 'I think you made a nearly deadly mistake in glorifying those business people in Howards End. Business is no good'. Isn't that the best ever comment on Mr Wilcox? Rosie Jackson's Frieda Lawrence, with the same jacket photograph as the Maddox, is misleading. It turns out to be a hundred pages in defence of Frieda - answering in particular the tittle-tattle about Frieda's promiscuity and pointing out that she spent only 18 of her 77 years with Lawrence - and a reprint of Frieda's own autobiography, Not I, But The Wind, which dates from 1935 and is economic with some of the actualite, yet has its own compulsion. A rather odd volume, but valuable to addicts.</p>

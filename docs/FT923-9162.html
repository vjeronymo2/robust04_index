			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / International Company News: Brascan holds dividend in spite of slight decline BRASCAN, a key holding company in the business empire controlled by Toronto's Bronfman family, has reported slightly lower second-quarter earnings but maintained its quarterly dividend. A greatly improved performance by natural resource subsidiaries and lower interest charges were offset by a smaller contribution from financial services and investments. Second-quarter earnings dipped to CDollars 8.3m (Dollars 7m) from CDollars 9.8m. Earnings per share rose to 2 cents from 1 cent, reflecting lower preferred share dividend payments. Brascan's share of group revenues climbed to CDollars 2.63bn from CDollars 2.42bn. The company, whose interests include controlling stakes in Noranda, the mining and forestry group and Royal Trust, a large Canadian financial institution, said its performance should improve as the business recovery gathers momentum. Some companies under its wing have recently cut dividends, but Brascan maintained its own quarterly payout at 26 cents a share.</p>

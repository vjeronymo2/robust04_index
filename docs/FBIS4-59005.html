			<p>BFN     [Text] Two Indian terrorists have been apprehended by  Pakistani troops after they crossed the Line of Control in  Nikyal subsector of Azad Kashmir on the night of 4th and 5th of  this month. Over 18 kg of explosives along with accessories and  two tubes of rocket launchers have also been recovered from the  saboteurs. According to preliminary investigations, the  terrorists -- Mohammad Yusuf, son of Sain Mohammad; and  Mohammad, son of Raj Mohammad -- belong to village (Neka  Panchgaran) of Indian-held Kashmir. During interrogation, it  has transpired that the two saboteurs received training in  handling of explosives at a Gurkha Rifle unit of the Indian  Army. They were roped in by one RAW [Research and Analysis  Wing] agent, Havaldar [petty military officer] Sharma, through  coercion. They were also promised that handsome amount will be  paid to them on return with a warning that if they refused to  carry out the orders, they would be shot dead and declared  intruders.    Prior to the agents' entry into Nikyal subsector of Kotli,  the Indian troops deployed near the Line of Control started  heavy firing on the flanks first to divert the attention of the  Pakistani troops, and also intimidate local population so that  the terrorists could enter undetected. But this commonly used  tactic of Indians aroused suspicion and Pakistani troops became  extra vigilant. As the two terrorists penetrated into Azad  Kashmir area, they were nabbed by a local patrol. Both the  agents have confessed that they have been visiting various  places in Azad Kashmir and Pakistan in the past for the purpose  of sabotage. The terrorists have also confessed that a large  number of educated Kashmiri youth are being imparted terrorism  training by Indian soldiers under threat of maltreatment.</p>

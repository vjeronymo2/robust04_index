			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Government Programme; Reactions, </F> Italian People's Party"]    [Text] (ANSA) Rome, May 16 -- Senators from the Italian  People's Party [PPI] (the former Christian Democrats) backed the  document approved by the party leadership this evening which  turned thumbs down on the speech Premier Silvio Berlusconi  delivered to the Senate today prior to a confidence vote.    As a result, the PPI senators are expected to vote against  the government which they accuse of showing no opening  whatsoever to the opposition forces in parliament.    It was also learned that life senator Giulio Andreotti, a  veteran Christian Democrat, discussed various scenarios with the  PPI senators in the event the government does not win the  confidence vote in the Senate.    In the document released by the party leadership this  evening, the People's Party decried the government program put  forth by Berlusconi as a mere list of promises with no  indication as to how these generalized goals are to be achieved.    The PPI was especially sharp about the fact that Berlusconi  in no way settled the problem of the conflict between his role  as premier and his ownership of a large part of the means of  communication in this country.</p>

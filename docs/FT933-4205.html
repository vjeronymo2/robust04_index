			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Survey of World Car Industry (17):  Fighting comeback against old enemy - The American buying public recognises improved design and quality / North America, The big three AMERICA'S three biggest car companies are making a fighting come-back. They have regained more than 2 per cent of the US vehicle market from Japan, their 'old enemy', this year, following 1992's small improvement over 1991. While Japanese car makers are handicapped by the strengthening yen, there is increasing public recognition that the design and quality of General Motors, Ford and Chrysler products have improved considerably. The result is that sales for the Big Three at the expense of Japan are looking up - although none of the American makers thinks the job is complete. 'We're not where we'd like to be (on quality),' says Robert A. Lutz, Chrysler's president. But his company is making the biggest impact in the showrooms, thanks to several well-received new model introductions which include the revised Voyager minivan (a trend-setter and class leader), Jeep Grand Cherokee and the LH range of saloons known as Dodge Intrepid, Eagle Vision and Chrysler Concorde. The Escort-sized Neon saloon will make its debut at this month's Frankfurt motor show, and will be followed shortly by the muscular Ram pick-up and medium-size JA saloons. And the outrageous, low-volume Viper sports car did wonders for Chrysler's rather dowdy image. So far, the new vehicles have helped to shoot Chrysler from a market share of just over 12 per cent in 1991 to more than 15 per cent by the end of June this year. In a gradually improving market, this means that Chrysler sales in the first half of this year were up by more than a quarter compared with the same period last year. It is no wonder that Chrysler is a Wall Street favourite once more. Its financial results this year have been good - helped by disposals of a component company and by Chrysler's remaining stake in Mitsubishi Motors. The more 'global' companies, GM and Ford, are presently handicapped by their overseas operations, particularly in the wake of the unprecedented slump in western European car demand. Chrysler has benefited from a concentration of its business in North America. This is typical of the company's boom-or-bust history: the ups and downs in Chrysler's fortunes are much more marked than at Ford or GM, companies which are bigger and slower to change. Ford recognised the Japanese challenge much earlier than either of its rivals. It began restructuring a decade ago, gradually improving its efficiency, quality and market share. The company - financially the strongest of the Big Three - is also on a roll. Ford overtook GM's Chevrolet as the leading nameplate in the US some time ago. Five of America's 10 best-selling vehicles are Fords, including the top truck (F-series) and the top car (Taurus). Ford hopes that the North American versions of Mondeo, which will be known as Ford Contour and Mercury Mystique, will join the best-selling list when they go on sale next year. In contrast to Ford, GM appeared to believe until recently that its great size rendered it impervious to changing conditions. But its steadily worsening market share, accompanied by a deterioration in its financial performance, prompted last year's shareholder revolt. Like Chrysler in the mid-1980s and Ford in the early 1980s, GM is embarked on a thorough overhaul of its policies, processes and products  - under Mr Jack Smith, GM president since last November. For the first time in GM history, the chairman (now Mr John Smale) is not involved in the corporation's daily operations. Mr Smith is unlike all previous top executives at GM. A hands-on man who is credited with creating the corporation's successful European operations, he has moved his office from GM's palatial Detroit headquarters to the more modest technical centre in nearby Warren. GM once built one out of every two cars bought by Americans. It now builds one in three, thanks to competition from Ford, Chrysler and Japanese carmakers, and clearly has more factories than it needs, especially in the wake of efficiency improvements. The adjustment will be a long and painful one: 23 plants are on the closure list. Mr Smith vows that reform will not be side-tracked by issues such as the controversial defection to Volkswagen, earlier this year, of Mr Ignacio Lopez, GM's purchasing chief. Mr Lopez was in charge of North American automotive operations, the group's principle area of concern. This made a net loss of Dollars 95m in the first half of this year, although Mr Rick Wagoner, the chief financial officer, says it will break even before charges for the whole year - a notable improvement on the Dollars 11bn losses recorded during 1991-92. It will mean continuing the cost-reduction work, begun by Mr Lopez, on bought-in components. Mr Wagoner says the group will have lopped Dollars 4bn  -more than 10 per cent - from its North American supplier bill by the end of this year. One real problem for GM at present is a lack of blockbuster new models that customers really want - for example, models such as the Chrysler LH series or Ford's Explorer four-wheel-drive. But the corporation has high hopes for next year's new Chevrolet Lumina, Buick Riviera and Oldsmobile Aurora. GM designers say they have learned from recent history, when look-alike styling contributed to falling market share and in-house brands competed with each other rather than with their real rivals from Ford and Chrysler. The bright spot for GM is its Saturn division, which increased sales by 25 percent this year. But Saturn, which absorbed billions of dollars, is a comparatively cheap, low-volume model. As it can never earn the profit margins of larger cars and trucks, GM needs to repeat its results across many other models as well. Longer term, the corporation is understood to be planning a full range of models with many fewer chassis-platform variations. The challenge will be to give distinctive character to cars built off the same components.</p>

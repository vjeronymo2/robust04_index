			<p><P> October 16, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> REGIONAL ROUNDUP: CINE-SOURCE STOCK FALLS AS 'TEXASVILLE' FALTERS  </P> <P> The stock of Universal City-based Cine-Source Inc. has collapsed from $6 on  Oct. 7 to 21.875 cents as of Monday's close.  </P> <P> Perhaps investors have noticed that "Texasville," the Peter  Bogdanovich-directed sequel to the "Last Picture Show," hasn't turned out to be  the box office success that Cine-Source, the film's co-producer,was hoping for.  Since its opening Sept. 28, "Texasville" has taken in a paltry $1.93 million in  ticket receipts.  </P> <P> The film was the first project for Cine-Source, which lined up $24 million from  investors to finance the production, promotion and advertising costs.  </P></p>

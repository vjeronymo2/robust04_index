			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Lib Dems urge Bottomley to quit The Liberal Democrats last night called for the resignation of Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, after her department appeared to admit conniving to block a Labour MP's backbench bill. Ms Liz Lynne, the Liberal Democrat voice on health, said a parliamentary written answer suggested that Mr Giles Radice's medicines information bill was killed off in the same controversial way that a backbench bill seeking to provide new rights for the disabled was blocked recently. Branding the move 'a disgraceful abuse of parliamentary process', Ms Lynne urged Mrs Bottomley to accept responsibility and resign. 'Clearly this government has used disgraceful tactics more than once,' Ms Lynne said. The answer - in the name of Mr Thomas Sackville, health minister - said that amendments to Mr Radice's bill were drafted by parliamentary counsel on instructions from departments and subsequently passed to backbench MPs. This was done with the authority of ministers. Mr Nicholas Scott, the minister responsible for the disabled, recently made a similar admission about the civil rights disablement bill. In apologising for misleading the House, Mr Scott admitted that amendments had been prepared by parliamentary counsel in co-operation with DSS officials and made available to Conservative backbenchers who opposed the bill. Lady Olga Maitland, Tory MP for Sutton and Cheam, this week apologised to the Commons for her role in blocking the bill. Lady Olga had claimed that amendments in her name were 'mine and mine only' - an assertion later contradicted by Mr Scott. Mr Radice's bill was in effect killed a year ago after failing to complete its report stage within time. The bill sought to relax provisions in the 1968 medicines Act on the release of information so that they restricted the publication only of genuine trade secrets. Mr Radice also wanted to create rights to information on drug safety. Mr James Couchman, Tory MP for Gillingham, tried to introduce amendments that could have wrecked the bill during its committee stage. Mr Couchman declared an interest as an adviser to Pfizer, the pharmaceuticals group.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Abarinov under the "Yugocrisis" rubric: </F> "Moscow Will Not Protect Barbarity out of Self-Respect. Andrey  Kozyrev is True to Russian Tsar Precepts"]    [Text] A ministerial meeting on the Bosnian conflict  settlement may take place late next week. This was announced by  Andrey Kozyrev on returning from Geneva and Bonn where he talked  with Warren Christopher, Alain Juppe, and Klaus Kinkel. The  conflicting sides are not to take part in the talks. According  to the minister, it is important now to hammer out a  "consolidated approach to the problem," something to be taken up  by representatives of the United Nations, the EC, Russia, the  United States, Great Britain, and France. Kozyrev voiced  satisfaction that the Western partners "do not become locked  into forcible solutions." He believes that the meeting of six  ministers may become a "major stage" in the preparation of a  summit in the same format.    Since the talks with Christopher had left a somewhat painful  aftertaste, your SEGODNYA correspondent thought it fitting to  ask if a Bosnian settlement might become victim to the Atlantic  unity Europeans treasure so much. Kozyrev replied that Russia  also treasures partnership with the United States, but this only  favors the search for a shared conception.    Reports from Gorazde, where General Rose stated that the  Muslim side had deluded the world community as to the number of  victims and extent of destruction in the city, lent Kozyrev's  trip some poignancy. Kozyrev said to this that the Muslims  would of course be doing all they can to provoke air strikes  against their enemy. In his view, the important thing is not to  reply to provocations, but that the Serbs' reply was "absolutely  inadequate" to the situation.    Your SEGODNYA correspondent asked the minister if he thought  he had really been too carried away with political infighting,  as some newspapers believe. Kozyrev answered: "We would have  been good-for-nothing politicians and good-for-nothing democrats  had we not paid attention to public opinion." The matter is,  the minister went on to say, precisely which amendments to make,  and with whom to compromise. "Some criticize us for having sold  ourselves to the Bolsheviks, others for having sold ourselves to  the Americans. This is normal, this keeps us on the ball,"  Kozyrev said. He underlined that thanks to Moscow's vigorous  actions, the NATO plan was cut back "50 or so percent." An  alternative for Russia would have been a categorical "no" with  no regard for the situation whatever. In the minister's view,  this is "extremism toward the other side."    Kozyrev thinks that all the talk about Russia's being  robbed,  that it has once again been passed over and denied its fair  share, is nothing but a symptom of an inferiority complex. It  is an inferiority complex that boosted the political career of  the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia. "It is on this crest,"  he underlined, "that dictatorial regimes are made. As for  democracy, this means self-respect. It is out of self-respect  that we cannot protect barbarity." He recalled in this  connection that it was none other than the Russian tsar who  first had the idea for the convention banning uncivilized  methods of warfare -- this tradition should be maintained.    In Kozyrev's words, one should not think that every word of  Moscow is going to be taken as an eye-opener. "You cannot say  the men in Moscow know precisely what to do. But then they do  not know it in Washington either," the minister concluded.</p>

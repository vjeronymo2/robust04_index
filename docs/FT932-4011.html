			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Imro backs down over training proposals IMRO, the self-regulating body for the fund management industry, has withdrawn controversial proposals for the training of professionals that would require fund managers to undergo 50 hours of continuing education each year. The proposals, released in April, sparked protests from Imro members who claimed the rules were arbitrary, unnecessary and unenforceable. The Institutional Fund Managers Association, an industry trade body, had earlier met both Imro and the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief regulatory watchdog, to register its objections. The drafting of the training rules followed an SIB directive to all four of the City's self-regulating bodies that they set training and competence requirements for employees of their member companies. An earlier set of proposals for training and competence rules for Imro members had been criticised by the SIB for falling short of the regimen set out by the other self-regulating bodies. In a letter to Imro members earlier this week, chief executive Mr John Morgan noted the industry concerns and said Imro had decided to review the proposals. Instead, the organisation will prepare a new consultation document, to be released in July, which will take into account all the objections raised by its members 'to ensure that full weight is given to all concerns', he said.</p>

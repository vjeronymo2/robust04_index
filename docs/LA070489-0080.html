			<p><P> July 4, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRITIC AT LARGE: A RETURN HOME FINDS AN EXTENDED FAMILY STILL IN EXISTENCE  </P> <P> What Thomas Wolfe meant, obviously, is that you can't go home again and stay.  You can always go home again on a visit, squinting at passers-by in the hope of  sighting a familiar face, searching amid the changes for any surviving traces  of your past, feeling at last, it may be, only like a stranger in a strangely  familiar yet foreign land.  </P> <P> It was more than 40 years ago that I left Hammondsport for good, and despite  many a summer visit over the years I ought by rights to feel myself something  of a visitor, anxious all too soon to say goodby again to my ghosts and be on  my way, leaving town and traveler to get on with their lives.  </P> <P> But it's never been like that. I always leave reluctantly, as I did the first  time, and with the suspicion that I am nuts not to stick around, at least until  the first snow.  </P> <P> After a dry winter it has been a wet spring here. Lake Keuka is high. The trees  and the lawns and the hills are a soft and astonishing green. The grapes are  already heavy with growth. There has been rain during the visit, the gentle,  straight-falling rain that soaks in and does not turn the gullies into brown  torrents.  </P> <P> Two or three times a day, rain or shine, Stanley Clark's 400-passenger Keuka  Maid, its nonfunctional but decorative red paddle wheels now in place, thrums  down the lake, horn tooting, bell clanging. On its evening cruise, it is lit up  like an arcade and the sounds of live music drift across the water.  </P> <P> In its partial first season last year, Clark told me, the Keuka Maid carried  27,000 passengers. It will do many more than that this year. There is a wedding  on board almost every summer Saturday morning, and the weekend dance nights are  jammed. The rock and country rock groups are very popular, the big band sounds  are less so, which is a disappointment to Clark, he said. That is his era, and  mine.  </P> <P> I've thought a lot about Hammondsport over the years, wondering whether it was  unique or whether only my own nostalgia made it seem so.  </P> <P> In the '30s and '40s the town felt to me like a very extended family, in which  almost everyone knew almost everybody else, and had for years. The past was a  strongly felt presence; it was somehow just around the corner on the next  street.  </P> <P> You lived with a strong feeling of community and of continuity, and there was  as well a sense of self-sufficiency; everything, even the telephone company,  was locally owned.  </P> <P> The telephone company is no longer a local institution; there is in fact no  telephone person in town anymore, only a building in which clicking noises can  be heard, and the local ghosts include Nan Wright and Laura Bailey and the  other operators who used to say "Number" when you picked up the receiver.  </P> <P> The local wineries, briefly owned by Coca-Cola and then by Seagrams, have been  bought out by a management group, Vintners International, and their fiscal  destiny is still shaped in New York. But they are operated by the local chief  executive, a lawyer named Mike Doyle who has survived three ownerships, owns  the house Fred Taylor of Taylor Wine built and clips his own hedges.  </P> <P> Doyle has made the cellars, as they're called, feel like local enterprises  again. Times are not easy; the brands suffered from unbenign promotional  neglect, but sales are rising again and so is optimism.  </P> <P> The smaller wineries -- Walter Taylor's Bully Hill, Peter Johnston's Heron Hill  and the others -- appear to be prospering, and attendance at the Glenn H.  Curtiss Museum of Local History is running ahead of last year.  </P> <P> The biggest employer in town is Mercury Aircraft, started in 1920 to make spare  parts for the Curtiss Jennies that were barnstorming all over the country. And  Mercury is still privately, locally owned, a big help to that sense of  self-sufficiency.  </P> <P> Hammondsport has I think never looked prettier. The village square has a thick  carpet of grass, which could never be made to grow in my day. The gingerbread  bandstand (built in 1892 at a cost of less than $400) is in fine repair,  waiting to be put to more than decorative use. There are trees and flower boxes  everywhere in the village, and nearly all the storefronts are trimly painted.  </P> <P> I'm still not used to the video rental store where Jim Smellie's pharmacy was,  nor the handsome new building of the volunteer ambulance corps where Johnny  Frisk's barbershop and Athan Carrasas' Keuka Restaurant used to be, but they do  symbolize progress rather than decay.  </P> <P> Progress, as always, fetches problems along with it. There is an acrimonious  debate as to whether to build a lot of condominiums or a state boat launch down  at the lake front, and I judge that the prevailing local sentiment is to do  neither and leave the scenery just as it is. I wish I were more confident the  sentiment would prevail.  </P> <P> They say lakeshore property now goes for as much as $2,500 a foot; a year-round  cottage just sold for nearly $500,000 and the quadrupling of assessments and  therefore of taxes has drawn cries of pain and outrage.  </P> <P> Nothing stays still, of course, but if you are lucky the changes are positive.  (Decay is its own kind of change.) It is hard to be sure on short  reacquaintance, but it seemed to me that Hammondsport continues to enjoy a  strong sense of community, despite all the tendencies toward alienation and  dispossession in the larger society.  </P> <P> The lawyer, whom I've never met but who lives in the house my great-grandfather  built, heard I was in town and left word at the museum that if I wanted to come  wander through the house again for old times' sake I was more than welcome.  </P> <P> I wasn't able to -- or I guess, more accurately, I was afraid the visit would  be fraught with more memories than I could handle. But I was very touched by  his thoughtfulness, and it seemed to me to prove that the feeling of the town  as an extended family had survived all the dispiriting changes of a  half-century.  </P> <P> I've been amazed how many familiar faces there've been to see and greet. The  tradition of continuity appears to continue as well, although among my  contemporaries there also appears to be a mass exodus to Florida along about  Nov. 1.  </P> <P> Despite Thomas Wolfe, I think a man can home again -- to Hammondsport, at  least. There is only one problem, which did not enter into Wolfe's thinking. If  the prices keep rising, I'm not sure I would be able to afford it.  </P></p>

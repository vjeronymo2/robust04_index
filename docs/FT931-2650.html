			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Hospital Corporation plans restructure THE DEBT-LADEN Hospital Corporation International Group, which was created in January last year when HCI of the US reversed into Bioplan Holdings, the UK healthcare group, is to ask its shareholders to approve a substantial restructuring. An extraordinary meeting has been called for April 2. The board is warning that without the planned substantial disposals it will not be possible to restructure satisfactorily the group's banking facilities, some of which expire at the end of this month. The proposals involve: The sale of the group's interest in the Bishop's Wood, Runnymeade and South Cheshire Hospitals and the Meriden ward at the Walsgrave NHS hospital to Generale de Sante International for Pounds 11.3m. In addition, GSI will pay Pounds 500,000 for an option on HCI's interest in two other hospitals in the UK, King's Oak and Sandringham private hospitals which were completed a year ago and are operated in conjunction with the NHS. When the option matures in December, GSI could acquire the interest for Pounds 6.5m. HCI's overseas operations will be spun-off to a new Cayman Islands registered company, called Newco, to be set up by four of HCI's directors including Mr Dennis Sokol, chairman. In a complex settlement the four directors would cancel their 33.4m shares in HCI - equivalent to about 40 per cent of the company's equity capital - together with rights to another 16.5m shares. Based on the closing price of 8 1/2 p per share yesterday the 33.4m shares were worth about Pounds 2.85m. Proceeds of the sale of the UK assets would be used to repay Pounds 8.3m of borrowings, of which about Pounds 6.9m is bank debt. The balance would be used to settle other liabilities and for general working capital purposes. In the letter to shareholders the HCI board says 'the proposals are necessary to secure the financial stability of the company.' Following the restructuring, and assuming GSI takes up its option, HCI would retain three independent hospitals, North Downs, West Midlands and Yale private hospitals, and a nursing care centre at Westley Court which, the board claims, 'represent an excellent opportunity for the shareholders.'</p>

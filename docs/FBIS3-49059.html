The  Committee for Selection and Appointment supported the bill  relieving Stjepan Herceg of the duties of state attorney and  proposed appointing Krunislav Olujic to this position. They  also supported relieving Dragoslav Gecl of his position as  deputy governor of the National Bank of Croatia, which was  requested by Gecl himself.    The Committee for Foreign Policy heard the report of Foreign  Minister Mate Granic, who pointed out that the international  community supports the integrity of Croatia, while the  radicalism supported by some in Croatia is of no help. Granic  claimed that the international community is not homogenous, as  well as the European Union, but there are various interests at  stake in their activities, in which the events following the  elections in Russia play an important role. The main aims of  Croatian foreign policy are to consolidate the position of  Croatia, protect the Croatian national interests, and find  common grounds with the international community, said Granic.    Speaking about the French-German proposal, Granic stated  that  it clearly followed from the proposal that the war in  Bosnia-Herzegovina cannot be solved politically without the  solution for the UNPA's [United Nations Protected Areas] in  Croatia. For the sanctions against Serbia to be suspended, the  modus vivendi for Croatia should first be established, which  implies a cease-fire, the opening of communications, and the  reintegration of the Croatian areas under UN control.    Regarding the negotiations on Bosnia-Herzegovina, the  foreign  minister stated that there was a consensus that the Muslims in  Bosnia-Herzegovina should be given 33.3 percent of the  territory, but that there were different opinions on where this  territory should spread. Granic remarked that there were strong  pressures on the Croats to concede territories, but it was  accepted that the Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina must have 17.5  percent of the territory. Assessing the Muslim positions,  Granic established that their orientation is to create a strong  republic based on the assessment that they can conquer central  Bosnia. The Croatian orientation is to stop this conflict  through negotiations and to resolve it through political  agreements.    Croatia is still offering the Muslims access to the sea, the  use of the port of Celjevo on the Neretva River, the  construction of the Stolac-Neum highway, and the tourist  community of Klek, which would be under joint ownership, said  Granic, adding that what the Muslims are demanding is not an  access to the sea but rather an exit. Granic mentioned one of  the possible variants: giving Prevlaka to the Muslims but  getting the hinterland of Dubrovnik in return and keeping Neum  under Croatian control, because, as Granic said, we will persist  in demanding that there be no cutting of the Croatian territory  at Neum.    The foreign minister remarked that strict observance of  international humanitarian and war law will help in seeking a  common ground with the European Union, reminding that the Croats  in Bosnia-Herzegovina released 5,600 people from prisons, and in  the last 32 days they provided passage for 284 humanitarian  convoys. Granic said that this orientation will be persisted  upon in the future, remarking that despite the Muslim offensive  at the Croatian areas in central Bosnia, Croatia keeps insisting  on negotiations. He announced that he was going to meet with  [Bosnia-Herzegovina Foreign Minister] Haris Silajdzic sometime  during the day.    The Committee for Legislation and the Committee for Work,  Family, Youth, and Social Policy supported the bills regulating  provisions for retirement and health funds and for children's  allowance. The above-mentioned bills will become effective on 1  January 1994, and the provision rates will remain at the same  level as in 1993.</p>

			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Letter: Narrowing a market spread Sir, Dr Robinson (Letters, December 11) is not alone in bemoaning the punitive spreads quoted by market-makers for UK equity warrants. However, there are two simple steps which may be taken to ameliorate the apparent difficulties. First, find a good stockbroker with established relationships in the market. Often it is possible to deal at a price inside the quoted spread, which is frequently no more than a starting point for negotiation. Second, restrict dealings to leading issues where quoted spreads are 2 to 3 per cent. Andrew McHattie, publisher, Warrants Alert, Nailsea, Bristol BS19 2EP</p>

			<p><P> September 21, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CAMPAIGN TALK;  </P> <P> A WEEKLY WINDOW ON THE CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS.  </P> <P> 18 days left to register to vote beore the Oct. 9 deadline.  </P> <P> 46 days left until the Nov. 6 general election.  </P> <P> INTELLIGENCE  </P> <P> AWOL?: State Board of Equalization member William Bennett, a Democrat seeking  reelection, missed two of his board's monthly meetings this summer and his  opponent is milking it for all it's worth. Unable to get any media interest in  Bennett's absentee record, Republican Jeff Wallack decided what works for  missing children might work for missing politicians. So he began handing out  milk cartons with Bennett's picture and a physical description pasted on the  side. A caption underneath suggests: "If anyone has seen this man in the  performance of his public duties . . . " they are to call Wallack's campaign  office. Bennett, who did show up at the board's latest meeting, shrugged off  the criticism. "The absence of board members is not an infrequent occurrence,"  he said. Indeed, board member Paul Carpenter has missed the last two meetings  while he attended his federal court trial in which he was found guilty on  racketeering, extortion and conspiracy charges.  </P> <P> Friends Forever: During the occasionally testy Democratic primary for governor,  San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos could be counted on to savage his predecessor  Dianne Feinstein at every turn. Especially loud was Agnos' denunciation of  Feinstein's handling of the city budget. Regularly, he lamented that she had  left him with a $174-million budget deficit to clean up. So who was it that  Agnos was broadly praising at a San Francisco fund-raiser last week? None other  than Dianne Feinstein, now the party nominee. "Some people say that the real  test of leadership is whether you leave your own imprint on the place where you  worked or the city that you represented," Agnos was quoted by the San Francisco  Chronicle as saying. "By that standard, San Francisco never had a better mayor  than Dianne Feinstein." Agnos credited his conversion to that common  post-primary affliction, party unity.  </P> <P> Mayor Sonny Bono seems to be getting a little bored with that seething  political caldron known as Palm Springs. "If I made a move, I would decide for  the Senate," the former restaurateur, singer and television star mused  recently. "At this point," he said, "I have to really question whether for  another four years I want to just continue being mayor of Palm Springs."  Without being specific, Bono said he had talked with U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson  about his ambitions. If Republican Wilson wins his bid for governor, he could  be in a position to choose his Senate replacement. Meanwhile, Bono is honing  his skills for the road. He returned last week from a promotional trip for his  new line of chocolate chip cookies.  </P> <P> EXIT LINE  </P> <P> "You have to agree, there's a very great and formidable woman involved in this  gubernatorial race, but of course Gayle is much too modest to admit it."  </P> <P>  -- George Bush, referring to Gayle Wilson, the wife of Republican Pete Wilson,  during a Los Angeles fundraiser.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pristina, Yugoslavia, June 16 (TANJUG) -- The  European Union maintains that Kosovo-Metohija should remain  within Serbia and does not support ethnic Albanian separatist  aspirations, a delegation of the Conference on Security and  Cooperation in Europe (C.S.C.E.) parliamentary assembly said on  Thursday.    Delegation Head Frank Swaelen told Serbian Minister Without  Portfolio Vekoslav Sosevic that the E.U. viewed as unacceptable  the province's secession from Serbia and Yugoslavia, says a  statement released by the province's information secretariat in  Pristina.    Sosevic and representatives of the Kosovo district informed  the C.S.C.E. delegation that all political disputes in the  province stemmed from years of separatist activity of Albanian  extremists and their aspirations for the creation of an Albanian  state in Serbian territory.    They explained that this was why ethnic Albanian parties in  Kosovo-Metohija were refusing dialogue with Serbian authorities,  although one had been offered many times.    These political groupings will persevere in their separatist  aspirations and will continue to avoid a dialogue with the  Serbian authorities as long as there is the least sign of  support from individual international factors, said Sosevic.    Swaelen told reporters after the meeting that the C.S.C.E.  wanted to examine the possibility of reincorporating Yugoslavia  in the C.S.C.E., (its membership was suspended in the summer of  1992) and to this end was collecting information about the  situation in Serbia's provinces of Kosovo-Metohija and Vojvodina  and the region of Raska (Sandzak) which is shared by the  Yugoslav Republics of Serbia and Montenegro.    He said he was optimistic about the chances of a dialogue  between Serbian authorities and ethnic Albanians in  Kosovo-Metohija.    After the delegation's meeting with ethnic Albanian  representatives on Thursday, the vice-president of the most  influential ethnic Albanian party -- the Democratic Alliance of  Kosovo -- Fehmi Agani said that the talk was informative rather  than anything else and the representatives had informed the  C.S.C.E. delegation of their well-known stands.    A strong ethnic Albanian separatist movement has been active  in Kosovo-Metohija for decades. it is openly advocating the  province's secession from Serbia and Yugoslavia and annexation  to neighbouring Albania.</p>

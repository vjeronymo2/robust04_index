"The normalization of Sino-French relations will make our  participation in the metro work easier," said Jean-Michel  Kuntzer, Vice President of Sofretu's Asia &amp; Oceania Company,  at  the signing ceremony.    Kuntzer, who is on his 25th trip to Guangzhou in connection  with the project, also said that his company has been working on  the project with the Guangzhou side for more than seven years.    "We have a good relationship with the municipal government  and local engineers," Kuntzer added.    According to the $5 million-plus contract, Sofretu will send  200 subway experts to Guangzhou to provide technical and  engineering consultancy for the most difficult part of the Phase  1 project in Guangzhou subway.    In the meantime, Chinese engineers will be sent to study at  Sofretu's headquarters -- the Paris Metro Company.    The Huangsha-Tianhe section, which extends eight-kilometres  through the city's busiest area, will be built through shield  tunneling, an underground construction method that meets  international standards.    In addition to its business here, Sofretu is involved in the  renovation of the Beijing Metro network, which was built more  than 20 years ago.    And for more than two years, it has been doing research with  the Shanghai government on the city's transportation network.    "As China plans to build light railways in more than 20  cities, we are hoping to enlarge our business here," said  Kuntzer.</p>

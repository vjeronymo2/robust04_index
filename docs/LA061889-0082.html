			<p><P> June 18, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> $96 TICKET THAT POLICE GAVE TO YOUNG BICYCLIST  </P> <P> I have a few questions for the Irvine resident who is outraged with the Irvine  Police Department because her son was given a $96 ticket for failure to make a  complete stop at a stop sign.  </P> <P> You claim he was a first-time offender -- do you mean this was the first time  he had failed to stop for a stop sign, or the first time he was caught? You  compare his ticket with a friend you know of who received a less-expensive  ticket for "the same offense." Did your friend only fail to stop, while your  son may have failed to yield the right of way to another vehicle? Is it  possible that the policeman who ticketed your son has seen too many bicycle-car  accidents in which the bicyclist is seriously injured (and usually at fault)?  </P> <P> And, finally, what kind of message are you giving your son about accepting  responsibility for his actions as you leap to his defense?  </P> <P> BOB COOPER  </P> <P> Newport Beach  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Aleksandr Orlov, secretary of the </F> Organization Bureau of the Russian Free Labor Party (RPST), by  Vladimir Nazarov: "A Computer Instead of a Megaphone"]    [Text] It is easy for a journalist to work with  Aleksandr Orlov. I must elaborate on this -- you call without  looking at either the clock or the sheet on the calendar. He is  practically always at his job, but if he is away on business,  you can get information from his closest assistants. I did call:  on Saturday and on Sunday, early in the morning and late at  night, called without any special need for it. At first this  "ordnung," so highly valued by Germans, delighted me, but later  on (a shovel full!) I felt vaguely irritated. What is this, I  thought, selfless devotion, sacrifice? Or a game? After all, it  is not a fire brigade, nor a street stall -- it is a party, the  Russian Free Labor Party (RPST), where Aleksandr Orlov is the  secretary of the Organization Bureau. He immediately dispelled  my doubts:    "This staff of ours really does do a lot of work -- but not  under duress, and not because of high wages. We all hold the  same views, for us the work office is a political club. Who  watches the clock in a club? I leave work, let's say, at one in  the morning, and they ask me, with irony: is this free labor? Of  course, I answer sincerely and very much in earnest: this is the  freest labor."    At this point it was hard for me to keep a straight face.  The  point is that Orlov's doctoral dissertation also touched on and  included the problem of leisure. This was natural, though, and  offered me grounds for my smile at the RPST. Everything else  here is serious: the clear vision of goals and tasks, the  clear-cut work of the staff.... We will go back to this, but for  now, a little about the party.    The RPST is one of the "oldest" in Russia -- it was created  as far back as 1990. At that time it was a party of newly  sprung-up entrepreneurs, cooperative workers and farmers. Hence  its small size, and indeed, small fame. Last June, a "changing  of the guard" took place at the congress -- Ivan Kivelidi was  elected chairman, and Aleksandr Orlov headed the organizational  bureau. Orlov: "several approaches to the party's future  activity were proposed at the congress. The ones that won --  won".... The RPST changed not only its leaders, but also its  orientation. Now it expresses interest in private ownership. I  ask Orlov:    [Nazarov] Aleksandr Sergeyevich, tell us precisely, how does  the RPST differ from other entrepreneurial parties? From the  Borovoy Party, let's suppose....    [Orlov] Roughly speaking, the Borovoy Party is a party of  large capital, which we concede to it without a fight. In the  sphere of our work, we have problems of ownership, problems of  the middle class -- the very class which supports any state --  and which is destroyed in our country by the power of property  owners who do not want to see that this is also destroying the  country.    [Nazarov] A "property owner" is a painfully eroded concept.  What is the necessary property qualification for entrance into  the party?    [Orlov] Nothing like that. We regard as one of us everyone  who is aware of the primary human need -- to freely acquire,  possess and have at one's disposal one's own property. The value  of the private property or business is of absolutely no  importance to us: let it be an entire plant or a single share  bought for a voucher, or intellectual property.... The main  thing is the psychology of the owner. After all, you can be a  very rich person and at the same time be a contemptible  person....    [Nazarov] Aleksandr Sergeyevich, the RPST consists of 50  regional organizations. This looks like quite a wide-scale  operation. But there are only 7,500 members....    [Orlov] This is not many? But why is this not many? Indeed,  there are clearly not enough of these forces for public  meetings, picketing and street fighting organizations, but  revolutionary shocks are not incorporated in our strategy or our  tactics. The party has grown recently, new people have come, and  more will come -- without a doubt. We are interested not simply  in the "growth of the ranks," but in qualitative growth. Let us  say, the Vorkut miners persistently proposed Kivelidi as a  candidate from their group for the former Supreme Soviet and the  State Duma. The Cossack oblasts -- on the Don, the Kuban --give  us good support. This does not at all mean that there are larger  organizations there. For example, there is only one RPST member  -- the director -- in the huge Uralmash Plant. Is this a lot or  a few? Do we need another party committee at the plant?    The RPST has true friends, and some of them are sometimes  still allergic to the word "party." They do not want to legalize  the membership (and they are acting correctly), but they are  ours.... Of the well-known people I will name Oleg Tabakov,  Vladimir Etush, Gennadiy Khazanov....    [Nazarov] You were not noticeable in the past pre-election  campaign....    [Orlov] We took virtually no part in it. Why should we?  Nevertheless, we have representatives in both houses of  parliament, in the government, in the state duma. Indeed, at the  present regional elections, the local organizations themselves  decide: whether or not to put forward a candidate from the RPST.  If yes -- we can finance the pre-election campaign, if not -- we  do not insist. There are only 28 of our candidates standing for  election throughout Russia.    [Nazarov] If you don't mind, I would like to talk a bit  about  the party staff. I heard: The Volskiy Party almost copies the  work of the CPSU staff. Even the furniture resembles it....    [Orlov] You see, after all, I too went through a period of  work on the CPSU staff. This is a serious school, it helps me a  great deal even now. In any case, I know how to organize staff  work. I know to whom to offer a job and to whom not. For  example, we don't need specialists in "pumping up" or  "organizational work," we don't need fiery orators --none of  these talents are called for in our work.... Our man should work  with a computer, and not with a megaphone.    [Nazarov] Whose talents can be called for in this case? How  many are on the party staff?    [Orlov] We have about 30 people working on the staff. Many  are scholars: sociologists, economists, political scientists,  philosophers. The task of today's staff member is expert  service....    [Nazarov] Boast about your achievements.    [Orlov] We have no special achievements yet, perhaps,  but....  Long before 12 December, our sociologists predicted  Zhirinovskiy's victory at the elections. They also predicted  sufficient passivity from the electors.    We are doing a great deal of interesting work now, as well.  For example, we are following and analyzing the activity of  almost 40 parties in Russia....    [Nazarov] Which of them have serious chances for success?    [Orlov] This includes Zyurganov's party. After all, in our  country they either reject it in a narrow-minded way, or extol  it, without noticing that the party has serious and, in my  opinion, progressive movements. They have not yet finished with  extremism, but the directors are seriously looking at the  social-democrat rails....    [Nazarov] This is noticeable from speaker Ivan Petrovich  Rybkin. Can you really compare the Rybkin of today with what he  was a year ago?    [Orlov] Rybkin's past, I think, was superficial. The status  of the man is changing, and his social role is changing. I say  this to you as a specialist.    [Nazarov] Aleksandr Sergeyevich, it is possible that in time  the situation will change, but for the time being you belong to  the category of small parties. You have no global tasks on your  shoulders....    [Orlov] This is the purest delusion. We set ourselves only  global tasks, and our staff works only on achieving them.    [Nazarov] What are they, if it is no secret?    [Orlov] It is no secret. We do not absolutely need to have  our "own" president, a majority in the government or in  parliament. We are striving for and will continue to strive for  a change in the political system, since we consider the present  one to be transitional. We want people not to afraid of the  state, not to tremble for their property, for their business. We  want the state to serve the interests of the property owner in  good faith and truth -- with no dependence on which party gains  the victory at the next elections.    [Nazarov] This will happen?    [Orlov] Absolutely.    [Nazarov] I read your party documents carefully, and I did  not find any RPST program in them.    [Orlov] We simply don't have one. There cannot be one in the  current changing situation. We have basic program units by which  we are guided in our work.    [Nazarov] All the same: how does the RPST differ from other  parties --related and rival?    [Orlov] To put it briefly, everyone knows what has to be  done. But they do not know how! We do know ....</p>

			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / How to Spend It: Timeshare flightpath to joining the jetset / How to cut the cost of owning a private aircraft I had been looking forward to a good hot breakfast, perhaps a glass of champagne or two, a quiet read of the morning newspapers and a doze before landing at Antwerp in the luxury of a private jet. Instead, I was given a cup of coffee in a paper mug and a lecture on why buying an executive jet for Christmas, costing anything from Dollars 2m for a good secondhand model to Dollars 25m for a top-of-the-range Gulfstream IV, was not, as most people seem to think these days, a self-indulgence. There is nothing quite like travelling around the world in a private jet. You can forget the tedium of airport lounges and long immigration control lines. When you land, it is a bit like arriving at a smart hotel in a Rolls-Royce. You feel pampered, important and free. On one occasion, when I was living in Paris, I was invited by Alexandre Couvelair, who runs an air charter and private jet business out of Le Bourget, for dinner at Eugenie-les-Bains, way down in south-west France. We set off just after the Paris evening rush hour and were back by midnight after a grande bouffe at Monsieur Guerard's restaurant. Another time, Henry Racamier, then head of the Louis Vuitton luggage group, part of the LVMH luxury-goods conglomerate, flew a little party in the Hennessy Cognac executive jet to Munich for a Placido Domingo recital. It was a wonderful flight, sipping Veuve Clicquot over the Alps and listening to opera through the aircraft's headphones. But Michael Riegel, managing director of the new UK-based venture called JetCo, insists executive jets are not just expensive toys for the boys - and, for that matter, their wives, who usually choose the interior layouts and furnishings. They are, he says, valuable business tools, which can make a significant contribution to the efficiency of a company. Riegel has imported to Europe the US concept of part-ownership of executive jets. He is touring Europe this week with three corporate aircraft - a Hawker 800, a Beechjet 400A and a turboprop Beech King Air - to try to interest potential buyers in acquiring a share of a new business aircraft as a more cost-effective way of investing in a private jet than buying one outright. Although there is still a general appetite to fly in private jets, in the frugal 1990s there is also a declining desire to own them. Mike Hamlin, another entrepreneur, who has set up the London JetShare Company, says: 'Financial irresponsibility still haunts the industry.' JetShare also offers the opportunity to invest in a share of an executive jet, but unlike JetCo it deals only in secondhand aircraft. Aircraft 'timesharing' schemes reflect the need to revitalise a Dollars 3bn annual market, which slumped in the early 1980s when the Inland Revenue abolished 100 per cent capital allowances on private aircraft. The tax advantage of owning a private jet had meant that companies went out on a spending-spree even though they did not always need to own a fleet of aircraft. When the allowance was scrapped, the late tycoon Sir Charles Clore got rid of all six of his jets. Hamlin says: 'What we have seen is a change of customer. Once, people bought a private jet for tax benefits, now they buy them because they need to go somewhere.' Companies have also become reluctant to invest in a private aircraft because their shareholders and accountants think it is a waste of money. The classic example is BP. One of the first decisions Bob Horton took when he became chairman of the oil company was to invest in two Hawker 800s and a Gulfstream IV. When he was pushed out in 1992, the first thing the new management did was to sell the three aircraft. Other private jet owners, such as the late Robert Maxwell and Gerald Ronson, have given the business a bad image. Statistics suggest that more companies that own private jets go bust than companies without any. But it is not just that the 1990s are a cost-conscious decade. Hamlin says the price of owning a private jet has simply become too high. The cost lies not so much in the purchase price as in the owning and running expense. It is a bit like buying a brand-new Daimler car - the depreciation is immediately in free fall. Fixed and operating costs can also be a blank cheque. To replace two windscreens smashed by a bird on a Citation costs about Dollars 50,000, and private jet-owners pay double the amount airlines pay for fuel and parts because they do not have the same buying power. Riegel says one of the reasons it is so expensive to own a private jet is that, on average, owners fly only about 150 hours a year in them. 'A corporate jet flies only about 10 per cent of a normal schedule airline. They also fly a lot of the time empty on return legs after dropping their passengers at their destination. About 35 per cent of all corporate aviation flights in Europe are empty flights,' he says. As a result, private jets are productive only 3 per cent of the time, making them a somewhat onerous asset. This is where joint ownership can help. 'Sharing the asset means you get far better utilisation out of the jet,' says Hamlin. 'You also get more flexibility than if you simply chartered an aircraft.' Riegel agrees: 'Our share scheme is designed to lower ownership costs by 50-60 per cent at the same time as giving the investment a more responsible image.' Under the JetCo scheme you can buy shares ranging from a third to an eighth of a new jet. Depending on the size of the stake, you are guaranteed a certain number of flying hours a year: 75 hours for an eighth; 150 hours for a quarter and 200 hours for a third. JetCo will also guarantee you an aircraft within six hours of booking it. You will not necessarily always get the same aircraft, but the company is planning to acquire a sufficient number of new aircraft all fitted to the same standards to ensure availability. In some cases, it may have to charter in an aircraft if its own fleet is fully in use, but the customer will always have an aircraft when he needs it. A quarter share in a Hawker 800, which used to be the British Aerospace 125 before the UK company sold its private jet business to the US Raytheon group last year, costs Dollars 2.7m compared to the aircraft's sticker price of Dollars 10.8m. The annual costs of keeping the aircraft are also much lower. With a quarter share, annual depreciation at, say, 10 per cent will total Dollars 270,000 against Dollars 1,080,000 for a fully owned aircraft. Annual fixed costs such as insurance and regular maintenance in the JetCo scheme will amount to Dollars 240,000 compared with Dollars 375,000 if you owned the aircraft, while variable costs, including the actual time you fly the aircraft, come to Dollars 315,000 a year compared with Dollars 341,000 under full ownership. If you add what Riegel calls 'opportunity cost' - that is the annual interest you would have earned in the bank from the saving in your initial capital investment by buying a quarter share rather than a full aircraft - you would save Dollars 1,578,500 a year by investing in a quarter timeshare, which would probably give you all the private flying you would need in a year. It is still not cheap when you consider that total annual costs of owning a quarter stake in a Hawker 800 amount to Dollars 825,000. But it still beats paying annual costs of more than Dollars 2.4m if you owned the whole aircraft. Even at these costs, the more parsimonious millionaires of the 1990s are still extremely hesitant about investing in executive jets. For this reason, both Riegel and Hamlin have stepped up their marketing campaigns to persuade them of the benefits of corporate aviation. Business jets can save precious time for top executives who value their time at around Pounds 500 an hour. 'Think of how many Pounds 500s they are losing every year hanging around airport lounges,' says Riegel. And Hamlin adds that a corporate jet can be an important marketing tool in helping a company win big contracts. To demonstrate how effective a corporate aircraft can be, Riegel organised a day-trip from London to Antwerp, Paris and Jersey and back to London which took just under 11 hours with time for meetings at all three destinations. By scheduled airline, the same trip would have taken 37 hours and 25 minutes. Hamlin has gone one better. He holds a Guinness Book of Records accolade for flying in a corporate jet to all the European Union countries in 19 hours.</p>

			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Survey of Canadian Forest Products (7): Woodpulp industry is fighting for its life - Laurie Morse reports that the battle against lower-cost producers will be harsh CANADA'S woodpulp industry is in a knock-down, drag-out fight for its life, as it struggles against lower-cost producers in the US and South America. It will be a harsh battle, since the bottom has dropped out of the pulp market just as Canadian producers are facing expensive new environmental rules, fresh labour negotiations and rising raw material prices. Currency devaluations in Scandinavia reduced northern Europe's pulp prices to Canadian levels last year, and wiped out Canada's buffer to world overcapacity. In the past, as the highest-cost producers, Scandinavian mills absorbed supply imbalances, shutting down when prices fell. Now, says Mr Eric Lauritzen, chief of MacMillan Bloedel's pulp operations, producers are in a Darwinian struggle, with everyone producing flat-out to see who will survive. Fewer than five years ago, pulp and its accompanying paper manufacturing were stars of the Canadian forest industry, generating healthy profits as lumber prices hit cyclical lows. Pulp, which uses the byproducts of lumber milling as its raw material, balances the solid wood side of forestry. The seeds of the current struggle lie in the rally of 1989, when rates for market pulp, specifically the northern bleached softwood kraft (NBSK) variety produced in western Canada, reached Dollars 840 a tonne. Canadian forest companies capitalised on the boom, aggressively expanding capacity. The rally was not lost on the rest of the world, and new pulp mills began to sprout all over the Americas. These were to make use of cheaper pulp fibres, including South American eucalyptus, US southern pine and recycled papers. Now, as the new capacity comes on line, high cost producers are fighting for their livelihoods. One industry survey puts world production of market pulp, the kind that is not immediately consumed by an affiliated paper mill, at 32.5m tonnes in 1992, while world demand was only 28m tonnes. Another 4m tonnes of capacity is scheduled to come on-line this year and next. Of the world totals, Canada's capacity is more than 10m tonnes. Nearly 12m tonnes of world demand is in recession-hit Europe. Rising inventories pushed pulp prices down to about Dollars 470 a tonne in March, well below the average Canadian production cost of Dollars 582. Labour problems, especially last summer's industry-wide strike, have added to Canada's inventories. The price squeeze has forced plant shutdowns in Canada and Sweden, and more are expected. Mr John Johnson, invest- ment analyst for Richardson Greenshields, believes prod- uction curtailments will bring prices above costs again in 1994. However, other observers are less optimistic. Mr Bob Elton, an analyst for Price Water- house, told a forestry conference in Vancouver in March that British Columbia's pulp industry, which comp- rises half of Canada's prod- uction, was plagued by high costs, high taxes and outmoded plants, and that it could take 15 to 20 years for the industry to restructure itself successfully. Eastern Canada's pulp plants operate at slightly lower costs than the west, but they have delayed expensive water-clean up retrofits and still must make the heavy environment investments currently being borne in British Columbia. Canadian pulp executives are waiting anxiously for a pick-up in the world economy, since an upswing in paper demand, particularly news- print, could wipe out market pulp surpluses. The best news for pulp producers this year has by a slight improvement in the US. The gain has stimulated an increase in newspaper advert- ising linage, and given a small boost to the newsprint and pulp markets. The European market has also developed a quixotic taste for non-bleached paper, an offshoot of the growing 'green' movement. 'They're wanting brown toilet paper and coffee filters,' says one Vancouver Island lumberjack disparagingly. The move away from bleached pulp and paper is founded on the fear that the chlorines used in the bleaching process are hazardous to the environment. Canada's govern- ment has imposed the most stringent chlorine standards in the world on its pulp industry. The pulp and paper industry has invested more than Dollars 1.9bn since 1989 to meet those standards, and is projected to spend Dollars 2.5bn more virtually to eliminate potentially harmful chlorinated dioxins from their effluents. In response to demand from European customers, Repap, the Montreal-based pulp and paper producer, has developed a paper bleaching process that abandons the use of chlorines entirely. The process, which carries the trade name Alcell, uses alcohol instead of chlorine or the sulphur-based chemicals that produce the characteristic pulp-mill smell. Repap has successfully applied the process to hard- wood pulp, and is adapting it for use with Canada's more abundant softwoods. The company says the process is substantially cheaper than those used in conventional kraft pulp mills, and that it produces valuable adhesives and solvents as byproducts.</p>

			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / International Company News: Goldman Sachs refinances part of debt on Rockefeller Centre Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, yesterday agreed to refinance part of the debt of Rockefeller Centre Properties in a move which could also give it a large equity stake in the company. Rockefeller Centre Properties is an investment company set up to own the Dollars 1.3bn mortgage on the landmark New York development, which is 80 per cent owned by Mitsubishi Estate of Japan. The Goldman Sachs move could leave it with an influential voice in any future financial reorganisation of the mid-town office and retail development. RCP recently disclosed in a regulatory filing that Mitsubishi may fail to meet interest payments on the mortgage, the next of which is due in February. Goldman and Whitehall Street Real Estate, a private investment vehicle managed by the bank, have agreed to buy Dollars 225m of debt from RCP. It has also been granted warrants and stock appreciation rights which, if exercised fully, would give Goldman and Whitehall 19.9 per cent of the shares in RCP. However, the company's bye-laws may have to be amended before they could take up this interest. At present, they restrict any individual holding to a maximum of 9.8 per cent. RCP said the deal with Goldman refinanced debt which otherwise would have fallen due next June.</p>

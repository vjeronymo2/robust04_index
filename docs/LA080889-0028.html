			<p><P> August 8, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: EXIT LINES  </P> <P> Rock star Billy Joel, who signed a contract as a young musician that gave away  his rights to his early songs, gives this advice to newcomers in the field:  "Get a lawyer . . . then hire another lawyer to watch the first lawyer. There's  a great deal of dishonesty and greed, and musicians tend to be naive about this  business." Joel made the comment during an appearance at a master class at Long  Island University's Southampton campus. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

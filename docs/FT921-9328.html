			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / International Company News: Elkem suffers NKr528m loss ELKEM, the troubled Norwegian metals producer, yesterday reported 1991 pre-tax losses of NKr528m (Dollars 104.2m), compared with a loss of NKr659m the previous year. It is passing its dividend for the second year running. In 1990, group losses included a NKr429m charge for restructuring and write-downs of assets. Group sales fell by NKr194m to NKr7.814bn, but operating costs were reduced by NKr42m to NKr7.624bn. Operating losses widened to NKr209m from NKr35m in 1990. However, Elkem said that it had made a NKr179m gain on the sale of a 50 per cent share in Alcoa Nederland but NKr135m had been charged to accounts for restructuring. Of the total restructuring charge, NKr60m covered 1991 staff reductions of 1,000 to 6,600, while NKr75m was allocated to cover 1992 measures. Elkem added that it expected to reduce staff this year by about 300. Elkem explained that last year it had experienced increased competition in its main markets, and it warned that current prices in 'real terms' for several of its products were at their lowest levels in 20 years. The company suffered from low demand and over-capacity in world markets which depressed prices. Elkem is evaluating 'various' measures to strengthen its balance sheet and to reduce the amount of capital employed, 'including the possible sale of business units that have limited strategic significance'. The company also said that it was seeking to co-ordinate changes in the structure of the ferro-alloys industry with other Norwegian metals producers and to secure long-term access to raw materials for the production of manganese and chrome alloys. The emphasis, the company said, would 'be placed on measures which reduce costs, utilise economies of scale and secure the greatest possible capacity utilisation'.</p>

			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / International Company News: First-quarter downturn at Mannesmann MANNESMANN, the German engineering group, has reported a 9 per cent drop in sales in the first quarter of 1991 reflecting the effects of slower growth in several leading economies on the big German exporters. The German Association of Machine and Plant Builders recently complained of a drop in the value of exports of more than 10 per cent in the first two months of 1991. However the current strength of the dollar may help to offset this export weakness. Mannesmann also reported a 12 per cent drop in orders in the first quarter. However, Mr Werner Dieter, chairman, said that last year's sales of DM23.9bn (Dollars 14bn) and pre-tax earnings of DM505m, as well as the dividend, could be maintained. The first-quarter results were marked by a very sharp deterioration in Mannesmann's Brazilian subsidiary, suffering the effects of the recent economic austerity packages. Stripping out Brazil, the sales drop would have been only 4 per cent and the orders drop 6 per cent. Mr Dieter said that he regretted having raised the possibility of a big takeover in the US two years ago. But he said the search for a suitable acquisition was continuing and several big deals had been thoroughly researched before being rejected. Mannesmann is still in the process of raising its stake in Britain's TI Group from 5 per cent to 9 per cent. Meanwhile, the price of leased lines for Mannesmann's digital mobile phone operation, a crucial determinant of its longer-term profitability, remains unresolved. The company's D2 network, which is due to begin competing with the Bundespost-Telekom's state-owned D1 network later this year, is in the difficult position of having to hire lines from its competitor. Telekom originally offered Mannesmann its standard price - which Mannesmann claims is about four times the OECD average - but this was rejected by the Bundespost, which despite being Telekom's owner has to adjudicate on such pricing matters. Mr Peter Mihatsch, head of Mannesmann Mobilfunk, said that Telekom's subsequent offer - an overall reduction of more than 50 per cent - was still not satisfactory and was still 'double the international level'. A final decision from the Bundespost is expected in June. One of east Germany's best known capital goods manufacturers, Sket of Magdeburg, hopes to come to the stock market after three successful trading years. In the current year it expects sales of about DM1bn (Dollars 598m) and losses of DM60m, but in the course of the year it will be cutting its workforce from 15,000 to 7,000.</p>

			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Companies): Directors' dealings The largest transaction to be reported was in The Telegraph, writes Vivien MacDonal of the Inside Track. Its chairman Conrad Black has carried out transactions as Hollinger. This has meant his dealings have come, rather unusually, under the heading of a major shareholder rather than a director. Since the share price crashed in the summer after the cover price of the paper had been cut, The Telegraph group has actually out-performed the market by a margin of almost 4 per cent. Black has been buying quite consistently at the lower price level - but he still has some way to go to buy back the 12.5m shares he sold in May. Computer People, the company that places information technology specialists, has been a star performer in the market since 1992. With very little to check its progress it has seen its share price out-perform by a factor of 144 per cent in the past twelve months. Much of the stock in the company is held by the directors. The largest sale of the week was recorded when one of these directors, Anthony Lambie, sold 200,000 shares at 233p, about 10 per cent of his holding. This leaves him with more than 1.7m shares and, given the performance, would represent a more than reasonable profit take.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- DIRECTORS' SHARE TRANSACTIONS IN THEIR OWN COMPANIES  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                    Value      No of Company                  Sector       Shares     Pds'000  directors  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SALES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Antofagasta Hldgs          DivI       17,500          59       1 Computer People            SSer      200,000         466       1 Dominion Energy             Oil      100,000          12       1 Litho Supplies             Dist        7,000          12       1 Manweb                     Elec       44,802         384       3 Perpetual                  OthF       29,769         316       1 Smith New Court            OthF       45,000         167       1 Stylo                      RetG       15,114          26       3 Swallowfield               HGod       18,500          33       1 VSEL                        Eng        1,300          17       1 Carlton Commnctns          Mdia       95,599         817       2* Close Bros                 MBnk      300,000         660       2* Renold                      Eng       40,000          74       1*  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PURCHASES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Ass Brit Foods             FdMa       10,000          56       1 Avesco                     Mdia      250,000          23       1 BET                        SSer       10,000          10       1 Bibby (J)                  DivI       36,251          24       1 British-Borneo Petr         Oil    4,500,000          10       1 Brooks Service             SSer       55,000          34       1 Capital Shopping           Prop      350,000         679       1 Development Secs           Prop      250,000          43       1 Foster (John)              Text      344,110          50       4 Hanson                     DivI       55,000          69       1 Hunters Armley             PP&amp;P       33,000          60       2 Independent Ins             Ins       45,500          96       3 Industrial Control         Elec       10,000          14       1 Johnson Fry Utl            InvT       11,676          12       1** Macdonald Martin           SW&amp;C        3,300          30       1*** Man ED &amp; F Grp             FdMa       20,000          34       1 Marks &amp; Spencer            RetG       10,000          37       1 NFC                        Tran      500,000         735       1**** Pillar Prop Inv            Prop       40,000          56       1 Powerscreen Intl            Eng       20,000          45       1 Reed Intl                  Mdia        2,500          19       1 Scottish Hydro-Elec        Elec        5,000          16       1 Smith (David S)            PP&amp;P       18,120          90       4 Telegraph                  Mdia      470,000        3021       1 Trio Holdings              OthF       50,000          13       1 Union                      OthF       80,000          76       1 Waste Recycling            OSer      150,000         107       1 Wates City of Lon          Prop      200,000         128       1 Whatman                     Eng       20,000          74       1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Companies must notify the Stock Exchange within five working days of a share transaction by a director.

			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / International Company News: Coles Myer outlines plans for expansion COLES MYER, the Australian retailing group, has announced plans to spend ADollars 4.15bn (USDollars 2.8bn) over the next five years on a store expansion plan aimed at lifting sales and margins, writes Bruce Jacques in Sydney. Mr Peter Bartels, chief executive, said the programme - the largest retailing expansion in Australia - would involve building 421 new stores, refurbishing 1,136 others and expanding and building more than 12 shopping centres. 'The investment programme is a major plank in our strategy to maximise future profitability and returns to shareholders,' Mr Bartels said, adding that it would be financed entirely from internal funds. Mr Bartels said new and refurbished stores produced sales increases of between 10 per cent and 30 per cent, improving investment returns.</p>

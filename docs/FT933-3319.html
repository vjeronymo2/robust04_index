			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Ingenuity - The FT Engineering Review (3): It's a shame there aren't any trains - Spotlight on Waterloo International Terminal / Andrew Taylor on London's latest railway station, built on time and to budget BY NOW, up to 5,500 Channel tunnel passengers an hour should be entering and leaving London's newest railway station. Right on time, and on budget, Waterloo International station opened on Monday, May 17 1993. Unfortunately, although the new ticket offices were ready for business, the trains and the Channel tunnel were not. The 50km tunnel, which has been plagued by disagreements over payments to contractors, is not now due to open until March next year, 10 months later than originally planned. Delays in providing engines and rolling stock mean that the first international passenger trains linking London and Paris and Brussels are not expected to start running until next summer. Then, passengers will be able to take the three-hour journey from the centre of London to the Gare du Nord in the heart of Paris, providing competition to the airlines. Construction of the new Waterloo station has been a remarkable success, proving that large-scale, complex engineering projects can be completed in Britain to time and within budget. The main factor has been the close co-operation between the client, in this case a state-owned railway, and private sector designers, contractors and engineering consultants. This has enabled the project team to overcome unexpected problems and accommodate late-breaking design changes without triggering large numbers of claims for extra payments. John Brown, the engineering arm of Trafalgar House, which together with British Rail, managed the project, says that the level of claims has been half that it would normally expect 'on an inter- national job of this scale and complexity'. It has been no easy task to build a modern international station, astride crumbling 100-year-old Victorian brick arches in the middle of one of Europe's busiest capitals, without disrupting traffic at the domestic Waterloo mainline station next door, handling up to 10,000 commuters an hour at peak travel times. At one stage concrete lorries were arriving every two minutes, 12 hours a day, say the project managers. The roof of the terminal alone is composed of two acres of glass and 1,000 tonnes of steelwork. The construction team spent Pounds 250,000 erecting and dismantling a 50 metres by 25 metres section of the roof at a test site in Yorkshire before giving the go-ahead for assembly to start. 'The roof was a critical part of construction,' says John Brown. 'It was a difficult shaped site and the roof required glass panels to over-lap, like scales of a fish. We needed to ensure that everything would work and that sub-contractors could cope before beginning work. It was some of the best money we spent on the project.' A lot of the credit for its success belongs to architects Nicholas Grimshaw which designed the station which snakes along the top of the old railway arches for 400 metres, tapering at one end to satisfy the tight confines of the site. Adding to the problems of contractors was the fact that they were excavating part of the site within 12ft of the roof of the Bakerloo line. There was a danger that the underground track would float upwards, distorting and cracking the walls of the tunnel as layers of heavy sticky London clay were removed from above. Sir Alexander Gibb, which prepared the design brief for the civil engineering works, calculated that only small sections of clay should be excavated at any one time. These holes were filled with the concrete foundations and the base of the terminal's car park before moving on to construct the next section. The work was so successful that the diameter of the tube line increased by only 7mm on one 10-metre section during the excavation, well within the tolerances calculated by the international engineering consultants. Another problem was to prevent damage to the brick arches caused by the lateral force of 400-metre-long express trains braking as they arrived at the station. The solution was to install concrete cross braces, about 15 metres high and 10 metres broad under the track bed. Constructing the terminal alongside the existing domestic station created another tricky engineering problems. One end of the century-old wrought iron roof had to be dismantled to allow the construction of the glass and stainless steel roof of the adjoining international terminal. The old roof was beautifully constructed, says Gibb, incorporating large numbers expansion joints to accommodate movement caused by heat and wind. 'We had to be extremely carefully how we braced this structure to prevent it collapsing once part of the roof had been been removed.' The station had originally been expected to handle 7m passengers a year with immigration and customs controls, similar to those at airports, incorporated within the complex. By the time it was completed the station was capable of taking 15m passengers a year, double the capacity of Terminal Four at Heathrow Airport, London, though that is several times larger than than the railway station. It has also been decided that passport checks will be conducted on trains rather than at Waterloo to avoid delays. Contractors, engineering consultants and architects have had to be flexible to accommodate the changing brief of the project. The project team gave a lot of credit to Bovis which organised the placing of the construction contracts with sub-contractors so as to minimise problems which might have been caused by changes to the design of the building. Regular scheduled meetings at director level were held between all the senior members of the project team to ensure that any problems were solved quickly and did not have a knock-on effect on other works. John Brown says the management team established a command structure and lines of communication similar to those used on successful North Sea oil and gas projects. This created a tight-knit team and ensured that information about design changes flowed quickly to those who needed to know so that construction schedules could be reorganised accordingly. The project team, therefore, was able to respond quickly when it was decided late in the project that full meals for first class passengers would be provided on trains after all. The change in policy meant that the station design had to be altered to accommodate catering facilities for loading meals. The result is a modern, international passenger terminal, gleaming in glass and steel, that has been built to time and budget with a minimum of fuss and disruption next door to one of London's busiest railway stations. It is just a shame that the trains are not ready yet.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                      Waterloo International Station  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Cost: pounds130m                           Construction time: 30 months Project managers: British Rail/John Brown  Architect: Nicholas Grimshaw Design consultants: Sir Alexander Gibb, YRM, Anthony Hunt, Cass Hayward, J Roger Preston       Construction manager: Bovis Construction  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Unto Hamalainen: "SDP Backs Finland's Membership </F> in EU"]    [Text] The SDP (Social Democratic Party) unreservedly backs  Finland's membership in the European Union [EU].    A decision will be made at a meeting of the party executive  committee to be held at Finlandia House next Wednesday [18 May].  <H5>  Challenge To Be Seized </H5>   "The SDP's position is clear: Membership in the European  Union is a big challenge for Finland, an opportunity that must  be seized now," the executive committee says in a draft of its  position paper that was discussed at the SDP executive committee  meeting on Wednesday.    The position paper was drafted by the integration committee,  headed by MP Erkki Tuomioja.    According to the committee's draft, the SDP will also  support  expansion of the EU in the future. The SDP supports "an open  union of European countries that meet the prerequisites for  membership and are committed to democracy."    According to the draft, EU membership must not be allowed to  become an issue that divides the nation. The Union must be  developed in an open and democratic direction.  <H5>  Parliamentarianism Must Be Strengthened </H5>   "For the same purpose too, we must continue to pursue  constitutional reform that strengthens parliamentarianism in  Finland before membership is implemented," the SDP thinks. If  the party executive committee approves the proposal, it would  mean altering the Constitution so that the power to determine  foreign policy would be transferred from the president to the  government and parliament even before the start of next year.    The SDP has announced that its goal is a Europe modeled  after  the Nordic welfare state. The SDP wants to restore the exercise  of power, which internationalization has taken away from  national decisionmaking, to "democratic decisionmaking" in the  Union.  <H5>  Monetary Union Is a Proper Goal </H5>   The SDP wants to develop common Union foreign and security  policies based on "sovereign states." Finland must be willing to  participate in joint peacekeeping missions whenever they do not  jeopardize its vital interests.    It views a common monetary union as a proper goal. Before we  can proceed to that, however, we must agree on special measures  required to reduce unemployment.</p>

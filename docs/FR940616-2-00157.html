			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> In addition to the Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing requirements described below, the Department has since 1971 attempted to translate the affirmatively furthering mandate through policy mechanisms such as the Site and Neighborhood Standards, Tenant Selection and Assignment and Equal Housing Opportunity Plans, and other program and project-specific strategies. In recent months the Department has recognized that these project and program-specific mechanisms do not fully address the broad-based fair housing problems which actually exist. The Department has also identified the problem of concentration of persons by race and income as a major barrier to the achievement of the objectives of fair housing in the United States. The Department is in the process of formulating appropriate responses that will be tested in the near future through special demonstration projects similar to this lab, including the feasibility of implementing a metropolitan areawide affirmative fair housing marketing plan through a clearinghouse mechanism.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=2 --> (2) The FHIP Program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Section 561 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987, 42 U.S.C. 3616 note, established as a demonstration program the Fair Housing Initiatives Program (FHIP) to strengthen the Department's enforcement of the Fair Housing Act and to further fair housing. This program assists projects and activities designed to enforce and enhance compliance with the Fair Housing Act and substantially equivalent State and local fair housing laws. Implementing regulations are found at 24 CFR part 125.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Three general categories of activities were established at 24 CFR part 125 for FHIP funding under section 561 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987: The Administrative Enforcement Initiative, the Education and Outreach Initiative, and the Private Enforcement Initiative. Section 905 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (HCDA 1992) (Pub. L. 102&hyph;550, approved October 28, 1992), amended section 561 by adding specific eligible applicants and activities to the Education and Outreach and Private Enforcement Initiatives, as well as an entirely new Fair Housing Organization Initiative. Section 905 also gave the program permanent status.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations at 24 CFR part 125, subpart C, describe the purpose and eligible activities under the Education and Outreach Initiative, the segment of the FHIP program under which the activity proposed in this NOFA is to be funded. Section 125.303(b) describes eligible outreach projects that may be funded under this initiative, including but not limited to the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``(1) Developing national, regional and local media campaigns;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Bringing housing industry and civic or fair housing groups together to identify illegal real estate practices and to determine how to correct them;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Designing specialized outreach projects to inform all persons of the availability of housing opportunities;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Developing and implementing a response to new or more sophisticated housing practices that may result in discriminatory housing practices; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Developing mechanisms for the identification of and quick response to housing discrimination cases that involve physical harm.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The activities set forth in this NOFA are eligible activities under the Education and Outreach Initiative of the FHIP program, since they relate to various eligible activities of this initiative. Other sections of this NOFA will specifically illustrate how this relationship is facilitated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=2 --> (3) Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing Requirements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The Fair Housing Act states that it is the policy of the United States to provide, within constitutional limitations, for fair housing throughout the United States. The Act also states at Section 808(e)(5) that the Department of Housing and Urban Development shall administer its programs in a manner affirmatively to further the objectives of the Fair Housing Act. Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing has, since 1972, been one of the means by which the Department has carried out Section 808(e)(5) of the Act through the programs it has administered. The purpose of Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing as stated in the regulations at 24 CFR 200.600, is to ``achieve a condition in which individuals of similar income levels in the same housing market area have a like range of housing choices available to them regardless of their race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status or national origin.'' These regulations also apply to all applicants for participation in HUD insured subsidized or unsubsidized housing programs whose applications are approved for:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Multifamily projects and manufactured home parks of five or more lots, units or spaces, and initial submissions by a lender for an application for mortgage insurance on a single family property, where the property is located in a subdivision and the builder or developer intends to sell five or more properties in the subdivision; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and dwelling units when the applicant's participation would exceed five or more HUD-insured single-family homes within the preceding twelve-month period. Such participants are required to develop an affirmative marketing program on a HUD-approved form. The regulations describe the specific components of an Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing Plan (AFHM) at 24 CFR 200.620.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  See the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  of August 3, 1993, HUD Systems for Approval of Single-Family Subdivisions. This Final Rule included amendments to the Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing Regulations that added handicap and familial status as protected classes under these Regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

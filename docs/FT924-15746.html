			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / International Company News: Continental Airlines gets Esop offer CONTINENTAL Airlines, a middle-ranking US carrier which has been operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection since late 1990, has received yet another investment proposal, this time from a group of former executives as part of an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (Esop). The proposal - the fifth in recent months - comes only weeks after Lufthansa, the German national carrier, filed a plan to acquire Continental for Dollars 400m in partnership with Mr Marvin Davis, the Californian financier. The latest offer of Dollars 25m in equity and Dollars 400m in Esop debt, would leave employees with a 52 per cent stake in the reorganised company. Creditors would get a 40 per cent tranche and the remainder would be held by senior management and Benefits Concepts of New York, a firm which designs, installs, administers and finances Esops. Other bidders for Continental include an investor group headed by Mr Charles Hurwitz, a Texas-based businessman, an offer from Mr Alfredo Bresner, whose family owns a considerable stake in Mexicana Airlines, and an offer from Air Canada with another Texan investment group. The face value of these packages has risen steadily from Dollars 350m to the latest Dollars 425m offer.</p>

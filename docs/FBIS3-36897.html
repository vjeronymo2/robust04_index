			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS-GIA correspondent] </F>   [Text] Tbilisi, 9 Feb -- The Georgian Foreign Ministry has  issued a statement saying that events in Abkhazia in recent days  clearly hinder the process of a peaceful settlement of the  conflict in that region.    It has become known, the document says, that during their  latest advance on 7-8 February, the Gudauta separatists used 12  items of heavy machinery, howitzers, and Grad installations as a  result of which six villages in Galskiy [Gali] Rayon were  destroyed. More than 100 people were killed, and the homes of  about 800 families was burned down. People were taken prisoner  and seized as hostages.    This action, the statement says, was carried out on the eve  of the work in Moscow of a mixed group of experts on the status  of Abkhazia and on the eve of the return of refugees and  displaced people to Galskiy Rayon, envisaged by the results of  the Geneva talks, and was planned with the clear aim of  preventing the return of the refugees. These actions not only  contradict the resolutions of the Security Council but also  pursue the aim of hindering the process of normalization of  Russian-Georgian relations.    Expressing a resolute protest in connection with the crude  violations of the Geneva accords, the Georgian Foreign Ministry  calls on the United Nations, the CSCE, and the Russian  Federation to activate all the mechanisms at their disposal to  prevent any further escalation of the conflict, which threatens  peace and stability throughout the Caucasus region.</p>

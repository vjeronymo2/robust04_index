			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / International Bonds: Korea Electric Power prepares to launch first global deal KOREA Electric Power, South Korea's partially-privatised power utility, is in the final stages of preparation for its first global bond offering. Lehman Brothers is thought to be arranging the deal. Kepco, which has a high single-A credit rating, is likely to file a shelf registration with the US Securities Exchange Commission today for a financing of at least Dollars 1bn and with an intermediate maturity. The offering is expected to be launched at the end of an international roadshow which should start next week. Syndicate managers noted that Kepco was already relatively well-known by international investors through its bond offerings in the Eurobond market and in the Yankee market, the US domestic bond market for foreign borrowers. They added that the city of Seoul was also looking to tap the international bond market in the near future. Among yesterday's new issues, Depfa, Germany's largest mortgage bank, took advantage of current investor demand for long-dated Canadian dollar paper to meet its D-Mark funding requirements. Mr Frank Ruhland, Depfa's treasurer, said it was becoming difficult to raise D-Mark financing with a maturity of more than eight years in the domestic German bond market. This is because investors are now focusing on the shorter end of the yield curve, which they believe will perform better in the event of further interest rate cuts than the long end. However, Depfa was able to solve this problem by swapping part of the proceeds of yesterday's CDollars 200m offering of 15-year Eurobonds into fixed-rate D-Marks. The bonds were priced to yield 36 basis points over the benchmark 7 1/2 per cent Canadian government bond due 2003 and 22 basis points over the interpolated 15-year area of the yield curve. Lead manager Goldman Sachs said the yield on Depfa's bonds was equivalent to the current yield on the Kingdom of Sweden's recent issue of 15-year Canadian dollar bonds. Depfa is expected to continue its international fundraising spree next week when it launches an offering of 10-year Eurobonds which should raise between FFr2bn and FFr3bn. The Canadian province of Alberta made a rare appearance in the Eurobond market yesterday with a Dollars 275m offering of four-year Eurobonds. Lead manager SBC said the issue was a refinancing of a high-coupon Swiss franc offering which Alberta called last month. This explains the unusual size and maturity of the deal. SBC said the 5 per cent coupon on Alberta's new bonds prompted some investors to switch out of their holdings of short-dated collared floating rate notes. Before the recent weakness in the US Treasury market, investors had been keen to buy collared floating-rate notes (FRNs) because the minimum coupon on the notes was higher than the coupon available on short-dated dollar bonds.</p>

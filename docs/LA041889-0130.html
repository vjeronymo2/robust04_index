			<p><P> April 18, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HIGHLIGHTS OF TODAY'S AFI/LA FILM FESTIVAL  </P> <P> Following are capsule reviews of today's screenings in the American Film  Institute Los Angeles International Film Festival at the Cineplex Odeon Century  Plaza Cinemas:  </P> <P> 'A Soldier's Tale'  </P> <P> New Zealand, 1988, 90 minutes  </P> <P> 9 p.m.  </P> <P>  Well-meaning but ponderous and improbable wartime romance, adapted by New  Zealand director Larry Parr and Grant Hindin from M.K. Joseph's novel. In 1944  Normandy, a British soldier (well-played by Gabriel Byrne) and a young French  woman (Marianne Basler) accused of treason by the French Resistance share a  brief interlude. Sincere, beautifully shot in Normandy by Alun Bollinger, but  sorely lacking in style and conviction. KEVIN THOMAS  </P></p>

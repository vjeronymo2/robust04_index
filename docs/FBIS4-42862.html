			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Views" column: "There Is No More Margin..."] </F>   [Text] It is not difficult for one to realize that the  United States and Britain encourage the new Turkish maneuver to  block the promotion of new, more effective, processes on the  Cyprus issue. A plan to amend Butrus-Ghali's report to the UN  Security Council supposedly to include Denktas' intentions is  already under way in New York. It is obvious that this attempt  aims at changing the climate that has been created following the  points made in the Butrus-Ghali report regarding Turkish  intransigence.    Once again, the United States and Britain rush to support  the  Turkish side. Once again, the United States and Britain attempt  to prevent developments which are not satisfactory to Ankara and  Denktas. Again and again, the United States and Britain render  useless, or at least attempt to render useless, every  possibility to steer the Cyprus issue onto the right course. It  is natural that these attempts concern us and we should deal  with them in a decisive and vigorous manner, because we do not  have the margin to be dragged into a process which derails the  Cyprus issue even further from its correct direction and  framework.</p>

			<p><P> January 6, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> J.C. Penney Co. said it has hired Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co., a financial  adviser, to help it "explore alternatives" for its Telaction Corp.  home-shopping subsidiary. Duncan Muir, a Penney spokesman, said the options  might include selling the operation or bringing in investors. "The purpose of  this is to see what direction we go in to make this a commercially feasible  project," he said, adding that the venture has already cost Penney $85 million.  The service, an interactive television marketing system, is now available to  more than 25,000 Chicago-area homes with cable.  </P></p>

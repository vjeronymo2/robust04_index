I hope you do too."  </P> <P> CHICKEN BREASTS WITH MUSHROOMS  </P> <P> 4 chicken breast halves  </P> <P> Salt, pepper  </P> <P> Flour  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons oil  </P> <P> 1 (11-ounce) can cream of celery soup  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon packaged onion dip and soup mix  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon lemon juice  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard  </P> <P> 1/2 cup dry white wine  </P> <P> 1/2 cup thinly sliced mushrooms, sauteed  </P> <P> 1/4 cup chopped sweet red pepper  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons sliced black olives  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons chopped parsley  </P> <P> Bone chicken breasts, if desired. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Lightly  dredge with flour. Heat oil in skillet and saute chicken pieces on both sides  until golden brown.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Second of three installments of an interview with </F> Subcommander Marcos of the Zapatist National Liberation Army by  Epigmenio Ibarra in the Lacandona Jungle; date not given; first  three paragraphs are LA JORNADA introduction]    [Text] Lacandona Jungle, Chiapas, June of 1994 --  Subcommander Marcos, of the Zapatist National Liberation Army  [EZLN] assured that if things stay as they are now, a peaceful  transition to democracy seems difficult. For Marcos, "when a  group of people decide that armed struggle is necessary and  possible -- a group mind you; I am not talking about millions of  people, but people with enough determination or who are mad  enough to carry out the struggle -- then big and concrete things  can happen in this country."    There is skepticism about the elections in what the  insurgent  leader calls "the basement of our country." Those who live in  this underground world, which pervades the country, "do not see  an alternative in any of the candidates, or a capability by any  of the candidates to lead a transition process to democracy."  The subcommander warns that "they conclude that all is prepared  for another fraud and what follows, instead of preparing for a  peaceful transition, which is to prepare for violent change."    He adds that "the historic moment is set and it does not  even  depend on our own strength." He says the only viable  alternative is a grand mobilization of society toward the  so-called National Democratic Convention, as the "point of  convergence." In this second portion of the interview, the EZLN  military leader insists that to speak of an imminent general  uprising is "not a threat but a warning." He also states that  the EZLN can negotiate "with the government that rises from the  21 August election or the government that arises from the  convention."    [Ibarra] What can we do about the elections, given the fact  that there will be nine candidates and there is supposed to be a  different democratic atmosphere? Are the people motivated?    [Marcos] The truth is quite the contrary. If it were not,  why does an armed option, such as the EZLN, continue to grow  under a truce? It is negotiating and will presumably surrender,  and there will soon be an election. Why does a military force  such as ours continue to gain territory, resources, and  strength? That is the logic we now face. Everyone tells us  that the people are more interested in the elections or the  World Cup Soccer Tournament. If so, we should have been  forgotten. I think they just followed the eight column  headlines and full page publications, and never took the  historic events that were occurring in the country into account.    It is not true. In most cases, people are not interested in  those events. There are many dissatisfied people betting on a  violent option. If that were not so, it would be impossible for  an army such as ours to grow, when all the technical and  military advantages are on the other side, meaning on the side  of the enemy.    We are trying to start this mobilization for the election.  Many people approach us by many routes. They do not come  through full-page publications, news articles, or by way of  demonstrations. They clearly say:     -  None of the political  parties offers an option;    -  None of the candidates offers an  option as president of the republic;    -  There will surely be  electoral fraud.     They are very skeptical about participating in the election.  They do not see any alternative in any of the candidates, or  the capability on the part of any of the candidates to lead a  transition process to democracy. They conclude that all is  prepared for another fraud and what follows, instead of  preparing for a peaceful transition, which is to prepare for  violent change.    Why does this happen in February, March, April, May, and now  June, when the Clandestine Committee says no to the government's  proposals? It is now when the electoral campaign is supposed to  be growing and the EZLN is supposed to be relegated to second,  third, fourth, or even fifth priority in the media. The  electoral campaign is supposed to be the top story.    According to the candidates, the debates are supposed to be  a  landmark in the country's democratization process. All they are  showing us is that the countries problems should be resolved by  unconstitutional means. This only produces more skepticism. It  produces the same reaction, as the same old show is being staged  again.    Now, however, there is an option; it has been demonstrated  that armed struggle, violent struggle, is possible. Now the  people are deciding that armed struggle is necessary. And when  a group of people decide that armed struggle is necessary and  even possible -- a group, mind you; I am not talking about  millions of people, but people with enough determination or who  are mad enough to carry it out -- then big and concrete things  can happen in this country.    [Ibarra] Can it be said that they are just a bunch of crazy  people?    [Marcos] Yes, the difference between this bunch of crazy  people in January and the bunch of crazy people in June is that  now they are scattered throughout the nation. Now there are  several groups of crazy people. If a group of crazy people was  able to wreak havoc in January, I ask you: What can several  groups of crazy people do in several states of the republic?    [Ibarra] It would seem as though we are headed toward a war.    [Marcos] We are still hopeful of what civilian society can  do. With the effective end to the siege; with the entrance of  the caravan of caravans, what in military terms is called a  penetration maneuver, a collapsing of the lines; and with a  belligerence within civil society that is very significant --  something that is very characteristic of sectors that  traditionally cannot tolerate one another -- we believe it is  yet possible to raise the banner of unity in a broadly  progressive, democratic left-wing sector and permit its  mobilization before 21 August to seek a transition. In any  event, an attempt should be made to make another opening in  which it will be possible to speak of negotiations and to speak  of peace talks that will not deceive the country, and that will  not use -- let me see if I can remember the word everyone is  using -- a padlock, which I believe politicians are using right  now.    Finally, the dialogue and proposals forwarded to the EZLN  were intended to put a padlock on the armed struggle or the  EZLN, and this proved to the EZLN that there would be no  solution. What was being done was the initiation of a period of  passivity to give other forces time to come into play. This can  only continue if there is indeed a definitive and clear change  in August.    [Ibarra] Are you not afraid that the influence of whoever  calls for peace will be more important than whoever calls for  war or warns of the possibility of war?    [Marcos] This is what we have expected since the  consultation  process, since the dialogue ended in San Cristobal. If the  people want peace, why do they recommend that we not give up our  weapons? Why do social sectors insist on this so much? I am not  only talking about dispossessed sectors. I am talking about the  middle class and the business sectors who are sympathetic to our  movement and view with concern the possibility that we may  surrender.    Why does an armed group of people, faceless people, have so  much prestige? How can this happen if it is speaking of war, if  it is clamoring for war, and if it represents war in this  country? The call for peace or to foresee peace in the face of  war is contained in the Second Lacandona Jungle Declaration. We  say it is necessary to make room for mobilization. Peace cannot  be a declaration or the product of negotiations at a table among  a group of hooded men who have no names, a commissioner who is  not a commissioner and who does not represent anyone, and a  mediator who does not represent the church as an institution.    The possibility of peace has to be the product of the  mobilization of this country, be it through an armed struggle,  civil struggle, or civil resistance. What we are doing is  issuing a warning, and we want this to be clear. The problem of  peace in this country is a problem of liberty, justice, and  democracy. Any attempt in any other direction is a masquerade  to deceive the country or to deceive ourselves.    One way or another, a 1 January will happen again, but next  time it will be uncontrollable. We believe this firmly. You  know how difficult it is to control a military force that is  conducting actions in a specific territory. The federal  policemen know it well. They know that during a clash, it is  difficult to control troops in terms of what they can do and how  they should react. Consider what numerous armed groups would  mean for the country. Think of what these military forces,  acting without any possibility of being controlled by anyone,  would signify. This is hell. This is not the San Miguel  checkpoint; this is going to be hell. I think that the military  will understand what I am saying if they know what a lack of  control or lack of command in the war signifies. They are going  to understand that the warning about a civil war is a serious  warning to all armies in this case, to both armies, the armies  of the federal government and the EZLN.    They can wipe us out, or they can appear to have wiped us  out. They can close all of the entrances and say: "You no longer  exist. We have killed you," even if we are alive. They can  exercise military control over all of the valleys, and they can  force us take to the mountains. The federal Army has the  technical and military capability of doing this, but it will  simply be postponing the problem once again. It could put an  end to this rebellious group in southeastern Mexico, but other  groups will emerge elsewhere. The federal Army cannot be  deceived into thinking that the solution to the problem is a  military solution.    One way or another, history has hit a crossroads. It no  longer depends on our forces. It depends on the organization of  this divided or disorganized rebellion that is called civilian  society. It depends on how it is consolidated and how it is  organized. We are offering an alternative -- the convention.  The convention would serve as a meeting point for armed groups  and civilians to regulate this peaceful transition or to give it  a little bit of coherence and, in the best of cases, to avoid an  outbreak of a civil war.    [Ibarra] Do you think the convention is indeed a suitable  path? Can it be?    [Marcos] Look, we, as an armed group, do not have many  options; we do not have other paths. We are facing a military  siege. We cannot send delegates to speak to other forces  because they are suspicious about whether these people are  really Zapatists.    As has happened already, there are other forces who claim to  be our forces for no other reason than to get money. In turn,  there is a great deal of mistrust in other social sectors if  someone comes and says: "I am a Zapatist; let us reach some  agreement." Then, the only possibility left is to call upon all  sectors to come and speak to us under terms of equality, but not  to negotiate a surrender; this is what the San Cristobal  dialogue attempt was. Instead, we need to talk and reach  agreements on something -- for example, on what we oppose or  what immediate steps should be taken in order that what we  oppose does not happen. We have no other alternative, but we  would welcome other efforts. Nevertheless, we feel there is so  much skepticism among the people, but the government and the  political parties still do not understand this. We see no  alternative.    For example, political parties all think the same thing:  "People are going to forget about the EZLN, and we are going to  retake the key role bestowed upon us by the calendar." The  calendar gives them a piece of democracy, a piece of electoral  change. The opposite, however, would happen -- and understand  me clearly on this -- because in the period leading up to the  elections a force that cannot participate in the elections is  growing, an armed, clandestine force, a force without a face and  which has a numerical disadvantage. This is not logical.  Something is happening in this country, and I remind you about  what I said in the last interview, when I told you: When  everyone in the world had said "no" to armed struggles because  of the disappearance of the socialist bloc, because of what  happened in Nicaragua, because of the negotiations of El  Salvador, and because the beginning of negotiations in Guatemala  -- when everyone said "no" to armed struggles, why did we grow  in 1992 and 1993? Why does an armed movement generate so much  support in January 1994?    Moreover, we are again issuing a warning, because in the  pre-electoral period this force is growing, and this means that  something is wrong. Something is still wrong in this country;  there was no change, and no one believes there has been a  change. There is a very serious credibility problem in terms of  the legitimacy of the electoral process. The only way to  legitimize the electoral process is for the government to step  aside, for both the government and the government party to step  aside. This is the alternative; the alternative was outlined in  January, and it cannot be called the EZLN. It must be called  something different. But believe me, weapons are going to  thunder again if change is not produced. This is a warning, not  a threat.    Now they are telling us in the newspapers: "They are making  threats from a position of force." No. We could surrender the  weapons, everyone would be happy, and the situation would  explode on 1 January, but all over the place. [sentence as  published] Also, there would be no checks and balances, and  then they would have regrets and repentance would follow.    [Ibarra] But your political vision seems a bit too narrow  because how can negotiations resume if you call for the  president to resign, and if he resigns, will you put him on  trial?    [Marcos] No. We are not calling for negotiations with the  government. Our "negative" response and the conclusion of the  San Cristobal dialogue mean that there is no room or conditions  for this to happen. I think the government recognizes this, and  it already has made concessions in this regard. I want to state  that we are giving up on a dialogue or an attempt at  negotiations because we establish, in the document, that it is  inappropriate to speak to a government that does not want to  change. On the other hand, it is time to speak to the people  who want to change it. We are saying we could talk and  negotiate with another government -- perhaps with the government  elected on 21 August or the government resulting from the  convention.    [Ibarra] Even if the government elected on 21 August is a  PRI  [Institutional Revolutionary Party] government presided over by  Zedillo?    [Marcos] We could deceive ourselves once more. We could try  to speak and talk with such a government, but just look at the  statements by Zedillo after we said "no." It is clear this  gentleman has placed no hope in negotiations, and certainly he  is not the government representative who has become our  spokesman. With what determination or confidence can we talk to  this gentleman, a gentleman, who following the dialogue, all the  procedures, and the cease-fire declared that the negotiations  failed, that dialogue is a failure? Evidently, this gentleman  would want to negotiate with weapons; that is, he wants to talk  to us with bullets. It is clear that he does not want to reach  an accord and that he is not open to listening to us.  Evidently, a Zedillo administration that may win the August  elections would be a very problematic government to talk to,  especially in terms of conditions and an agenda for such talks.    Also, it would raise a question among all armed and unarmed  Mexicans: Did he really win, or is it once again a sham? The  sham might be clear -- say, a shameless fraud -- or it might be  subtle. Nevertheless, even if he wins technically with so many  votes over his closest opponent, he already faces a credibility  problem. No one is going to believe this gentleman won the  presidential elections after his performance. If it wins the  presidential elections, the PRI's problem will not be the EZLN.  Instead, its problem will be that of the entire country -- all  Indian and peasant groups, workers, students, teachers,  housewives, settlers. If it wins the presidential elections,  the problem for the PRI will be a civil war; that is what its  problem will be.    [Ibarra] To be direct, there can be no peace with the PRI.    [Marcos] No. This is final. Under these conditions, we have  remained silent about what happens in other cases. People are  no longer willing to wait for a commitment to behave properly  and to make changes because the PRI is founded on a false system  at all levels. The PRI has its own name and image, and it must  pay its debts to everyone: Indian chiefs in Indian communities,  municipal presidents, police chiefs, judicial police commanders,  secretaries and engineers from some governmental office,  employees, and others. The PRI has a name and a face for the  people; the PRI can be blamed for anything that happens to  anyone because it appointed an official somewhere whom it cannot  remove now. As a political party, the PRI is built on these  kinds of situations. It is impossible, as we said in our second  declaration, for the government to comply with the  San Cristobal agreement because it can do nothing to try to  comply with it. I repeat: The PRI is built on such situations.    Look how the seemingly most rational and logical agreement  --  one that denounces discrimination against Indians and recognizes  their dignity -- sparks reactions from the true natives of  San Cristobal de las Casas and from the cattle ranchers who  maintain that saying Indians are honorable is racism because  they ask: So what does that make those who are not Indians?  They even oppose this view. This cannot be. I insist the EZLN  is not the problem; the whole country is the problem. The  people are no longer willing to give the PRI another  opportunity. Let us say the 1 January No more slogan  has become No more state party by June 1994. I am  telling you, we are betting on this in light of our analysis of  the situation.    [Ibarra] What we are talking about here is the permanence of  the state party.    [Marcos] Then, it does not make sense. If this system still  has an opportunity to perpetuate itself, and if it still has the  strength to rule, then why does a force that disadvantageously  rebels against this system grow under such conditions? It is  growing not only in the dispossessed sectors; its acceptance is  growing in middle class sectors and even in business sectors.  This force that is demanding change must have something to it.  What we are saying is this: There seems to be a consensus  among many sectors -- understand me on this -- and even among  privileged classes, on the belief that the state party must  disappear; there are few other alternatives.    [Ibarra] What alternatives are left then?    [Marcos] What we are proposing is a transition period for a  transition government to make time for the diverse groups to  organize themselves and to face whomever there is to face. This  includes the majority of the population. This is what we are  saying: If there are many forces that agree the state party must  disappear, but they are divided on what should replace the  party, then let us have a transition government to give these  forces time to properly propose alternatives and see what  happens.    They say: "We lack time, because the elections are so  close."  This is how we respond: You lack time because the war is  already coming. They must understand this. The problem in  August is not the elections; it is the war. This is why we are  saying the only possibility of resolving this problem is  agreeing on appointing someone while the change is being  organized. This someone must keep things more or less stable  while we determine what forces are going to influence or head  what is now being usurped by the state party -- namely, the  people's resolve.</p>

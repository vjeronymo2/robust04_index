			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["International Commentary" by Wei Guoqiang (7614 0948 </F> 1730): "PRC Active Diplomacy"]    [Text] The year 1994 has just begun and a situation of  unprecedented vigor has appeared on China's diplomatic front.  Qiao Shi, National People's Congress [NPC] Standing Committee  chairman; Liu Huaqing, Central Military Commission[CMC] vice  chairman; Qian Qichen, vice premier and foreign minister; and  Liu Huaqiu, deputy foreign minister left in turn for visits to  Europe, Southeast Asia, Africa, France, and the United States.  Meanwhile, Hwang Jang Yop, secretary of the Workers' Party of  Korea Central Committee; Cambodian First Prime Minister Norodom  Narariddh and Second Prime Minister Hun Sen; U.S. Treasury  Secretary Lloyd Bentsen and a U.S. Congressional delegation;  Tsutomu Hata, Japanese deputy prime minister and foreign  minister; Andrei Kozirev, Russian foreign minister; and  Azerbaijan Foreign Minister Hasang Hasangnuofu [0761 2718 0761  2718 6179 1133] also paid visits to China. Such a busy lineup  of bilateral exchanges within a short span of one month shows  China's expanding diplomatic front and that China's increasingly  active diplomatic activities are yielding fruitful results.    NPC Standing Committee Chairman Qiao Shi's recent  three-nation tour of Germany, Switzerland, and Austria, the  first visit by a Chinese leader to these three countries for  four years, received a warm and high-profile welcome. While in  Germany, Qiao Shi expressed the view that China and Germany  should approach and handle their bilateral relations from a  strategic plane. German Chancellor Kohl also said that Germany  and China share a special relationship and could do much  together in many spheres. During Qiao Shi's visits to  Switerland and Austria, the leaders of these two countries also  expressed their willingness to further promote understanding,  strengthen cooperation, and develop economic and trade ties with  China.    Because of its proximity, Southeast Asia has had traditional  ties of friendship with China. Recent years have seen a steady  growth in exchanges and cooperation between China and some of  the Southeast Asian countries on the economic and trade fronts.  Thus, strengthening and developing ties of friendship and  cooperation with Southeast Asian countries is not only conducive  to the maintenance of peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific  region but is in the fundamental interest of the peoples of  China and the Southeast Asian countries. China has always  attached great importance to its ties of friendship and  cooperation with Southeast Asian countries. CMC Vice Chairman  Liu Huaqing visited Thailand and Indonesia recently and made a  brief stopover in Singapore. During his tour, Liu Huaqing met  with the leaders of these countries and explained China's  consistent principled stand of hoping to see peace and  stability, friendly cooperation, and common development in the  Asia- Pacific region. China's sincerity received high acclaim  from Thailand, Indonesia and Singapore.    During his tour of the six African countries of Ethiopia,  Eritrea, Sudan, Kenya, Madagascar, and Mauritius, Qian Qichen  reiterated China's policy toward Africa, emphasizing that it is  the fundamental point of departure of China's foreign policy to  strengthen solidarity and cooperation with African nations and  other developing countries. In international and regional  affairs, China has many points in common with the African  nations. During Qian Qichen's six-nation tour of Africa, all  sides expressed the desire to further expand economic and trade  cooperation. Qian Qichen noted that economic and trade  relations between China and Africa embodied the spirit of mutual  benefit and assistance for common development. This shows that  China's policy of opening to the outside world is  multidirectional and that China not only wants to develop ties  of economic and trade cooperation with the developed countries  of the West and with its neighbors but also sincerely wishes to  develop diverse forms of cooperation based on mutual benefits  with the vast numbers of developing countries.    Not long after the Chinese and French Governments issued a  joint communique on the restoration of the traditional ties of  friendship and cooperation between the two countries on the  basis of the principles guiding the establishment of diplomatic  relations, Foreign Minister Qian Qichen paid an official visit  to France and received a warm welcome from the French. The  visit marked the beginning of "a new period" in Sino-French  relations after a difficult period. China and France are both  permanent members of the UN Security Council and both possess  nuclear weapons. Thus, an improvement in Sino-French relations  is not only conducive to economic and trade cooperation between  the two countries but will contribute to world peace and  stability. As Qian Qichen said in his recent meeting with  Peileifeite [0160 7191 5481 3676], the French prime minister's  special envoy, Sino-French relations have played a constructive,  stabilizing, and balancing role in the world over the past 30  years. In his opinion, the importance of these relations  exceeds the limits of bilateral relations and should be carried  forward in the current international situation.    While in Paris, Qian Qichen also met U.S. Secretary of  State Warren Christopher. Both sides reiterated that: China  and the United States share common interests and assume  important responsibilities in the maintenance of international  peace and security and in a wide range of other affairs; there  are huge potential and broad prospects for economic and trade  cooperation between the two countries; and that it is in the  fundamental interests of the peoples of both countries to expand  exchanges and cooperation on the economic, trade, and scientific  and technological fronts. Both sides also noted that the  meeting between Chinese State President Jiang Zemin and U.S.  President Clinton in Seattle last November represented a good  start to bilateral relations. At the end of January, in his  meeting with Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister Liu Huaqiu in  Washington, Christopher reiterated that the United States was  working hard on developing major ties with China and was willing  to continue working hand in hand with the Chinese in bringing  bilateral relations onto the road of healthy development as  quickly as possible.    This favorable situation in China's foreign relations has  come about as a result of its efforts to uphold a peaceful  foreign policy of maintaining independence and taking the  initiative in its own hands; it is also the fruit of its reform  and open policy, which has brought about an excellent situation  of political stability, unity among the people, and economic  development. It shows that China's sincere approach has been  increasingly widely understood and that its market, with its  immense potential, has become more and more attractive.    Looking around, it is only with Britain that we are having a  little trouble. We are also willing to develop ties of  friendship and cooperation with Britain. Of course we are not  going to do so at the expense of principle and sovereignty. We  have the desire and the patience and believe that the problem  between our two countries will be resolved sooner or later as  the trend of the times dictate.</p>

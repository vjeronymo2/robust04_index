			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Abu-Dhabi, 13 Jan (MENA)--Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa  has announced that Egypt has requested that the issue of  reviving Arab solidarity be included on the agenda of the next  Arab League meeting, and has noted Egypt's support for the  initiative of United Arab Emirates [UAE] President Shaykh Zayid  Bin-Sultan on this matter.    In an interview with the UAE paper AL-ITTIHAD today, Musa  affirmed that there are no differences among the Damascus  Declaration member countries. He said: Efforts and political  views are unified and everyone supports the peace process. We  all are against extremism and want economic reform and our  stances on all problems and crises are unified.    He added that turning the Damascus Declaration into an  economic bloc is a good idea and that it is important that we  should ensure the success of this idea. He said that there is  an enormous opportunity to revive the Damascus Declaration  because there is a consensus on the need to support it in the  face of regional developments.    Musa expected the Syrian-U.S. summit to give momentum to the  Syrian-Israeli track of the peace negotiations and said that the  situation will become extremely dangerous if the summit yields  nothing.    He noted that Syrian-Egyptian coordination in economics and  development has accomplished a great deal, and that this is an  age of cooperation and interests and not one of slogans.    On Egypt's view of reviving Arab solidarity, the Egyptian  foreign minister said that there are some impediments,  especially after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, that should be  addressed. He added that contradictions still exist and that  there are foreign currents that are trying to subvert the Arab  region under various themes to undermine stability in the Arab  world. Our task, he said, is to create stability in the Arab  world, but this will not work without economic reform and  genuine solidarity. He said that the issue should be discussed  quietly and that we must be ready for change and deal with it  united.</p>

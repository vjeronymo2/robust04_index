			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / International Company News: ITT records 14% decline but raises its dividend ITT, the US conglomerate, yesterday blamed the extended worldwide recession and the strength of the US dollar for a 14.7 per cent drop in its 1991 net earnings to Dollars 817m, or Dollars 6.05 a share. The New York-based group recorded a 1 per cent decline in 1991 revenues, to Dollars 20.4bn. However, it said that its operating income and financial strength were sufficient to permit an increase in the annual dividend, from Dollars 1.72 to Dollars 1.84 a share. The results appeared to have had little impact on Wall Street as the company's share price closed unchanged last night at Dollars 59 1/4 . Net income in the fourth quarter of 1991 was Dollars 195m, or Dollars 1.44 a share, more than double the Dollars 84m, or 65 cents, earned in the last quarter of 1990. But the 1991 fourth quarter included after-tax portfolio gains totalling Dollars 79m at the ITT Hartford insurance group and ITT financial division. Fourth-quarter revenues declined by 2 per cent, to Dollars 5.35bn. ITT said that three of its four service businesses improved their operating earnings in 1991. These were the Hartford insurance group, the ITT communications and information services division and the ITT financial arm. The ITT Sheraton hotel business suffered lower earnings as a result of lower occupancy rates, which reflected reduced travel in the US and the impact of recession. Hartford's investment income and improved US underwriting helped the insurance business, but non-US operations were affected adversely by problems in the UK. ITT's defence division had higher earnings on lower sales due to improved contract performance. The automotive business suffered a significant decline in operating income. Forest products operations had sharply lower operating earnings, reflecting the industry downturn in pulp pricing. ITT electronic components showed a loss in 1991 due to restructuring and volume reductions while ITT fluid technology results were hit by lower margins.</p>

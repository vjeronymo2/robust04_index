			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Comments by International Trade and Industry Minister </F> Hiroshi Kumagai during a panel debate moderated by political  commentator Soichiro Tawara; from the "Sunday Project" program  -- via satellite hookup]    [Excerpts] [Kumagai, commenting on the issue of numerical  targets in the Japanese-U.S. framework trade talks] I would  like to refute [Keio University] Professor Takenaka's assertion  that Japan has not proposed an alternative to the numerical  targets put forward by the United States. The fact is that,  based on actual trade results, Japan has proposed concrete  measures to help promote the access of U.S. firms to Japanese  markets. There is a discord between Japan and the United States  over the U.S. call for Japan to indicate market share targets  for U.S. companies in Japanese markets modeled on agreements  reached in the semiconductor talks. As Professor Takenaka  pointed out, the call will lead to managed trade. The Hosokawa  cabinet believes that, because the roles of the government and  private sectors have changed, the past tactics of the Ministry  of International Trade and Industry should be scrapped. Based on  this principle, the government has proposed concrete measures to  help U.S. and Japanese companies in their business activities.  The concrete measures include a plan to set up a joint  Japanese-U.S. committee to study the reasons behind stagnant  U.S. exports to Japan by examining the trade results of each  country. For example, the United States has called on the  subsidiaries of Japanese automakers in the United States to  increase their procurement of U.S.-made parts. If they are  going to buy more, U.S. parts makers have to improve the quality  of their products. To do this, both sides should submit their  plans under the so-called design-in scheme, and discuss the  design and cost of parts. Specifically, if they are to increase  Japanese procurement, they need to decide just how long they are  going to discuss these matters. Unlike government procurement,  however, private-sector procurement can change and depends on  the behavior of consumers and industry. The call to set targets  for procurement by the private sectors ignores this and is  tantamount to a controlled economy. We cannot accept such a  call. [passage omitted on remarks by other panelists]    [Kumagai, commenting on remarks by U.S. Treasury  Undersecretary Lawrence Summers that Washington is not demanding  numerical targets but indicators that monitor Japanese efforts  to open its markets] Washington is urging that Tokyo accept the  proposal to set indicators while we have expressed apprehension  that such indicators might become virtually numerical targets.  The principle Mr. Summers has just mentioned has been agreed by  Japan. I believe, therefore, that if we negotiate based on this  principle and with wisdom, we will certainly be able to  successfully conclude all trade sector talks, including talks on  macroeconomic measures, by 10 February. We should and can  conclude them by that date. As [Kyoto University] Professor  Kosaka pointed out, neither side can reveal its trump card while  negotiations are continuing. At the final stage, then, we hope  to make a political decision which can conclude the trade talks.  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa has repeated that the  government backs the agreement to create new markets, to review  the roles of government and private sector, and to create a  society which is open. I hope the two sides will conclude trade  talks based on these principles. I think Mr. Summers shares  that view. [passage omitted on comments by other panelists]    [Kumagai, commenting on Professor Takenaka's proposal that  Tokyo take responsibility for its macroeconomic issues and  Washington withdraw demands for measures that might lead to  managed trade] Since the first Hosokawa-Clinton talks we have  discussed macroeconomic issues based on the idea that Japan  should bear responsibility for the world economy. Japan has  promoted the discussions, not only to fulfill pledges to the  United States but to play its due role in the world. With this  in mind, the government is struggling to implement drastic  pump-priming measures and control the domestic situation.  Although the ratio of Japan's current account surplus to its  GNP was once 3.6 percent, it has dropped to about 3 percent.  Mindful of this, the government is trying to implement economic  stimulus measures. If Washington sees Japan's efforts to shore  up the economy, it will know that the Hosokawa government, has  tried to meet its responsibilities. It is true that Japan and  the United States distrust each other. Whether or not the  distrust is dispelled depends on your political stance.    [Kumagai answering Tahara's question as to what measures  he would propose to dispel distrust between Japan and the United  States] I think Japan should disclose its outlook for economic  growth and its stimulus measures. Prime Minister Hosokawa has  announced his long-term vision for the 20th century. He is now  trying to compile pump-priming measures, including the fiscal  1994 budget. I hope Washington will understand that in the  process of formulating pump-priming measures, many political  adjustments are needed.    [Kumagai commenting on a retracted Hosokawa proposal to  create a national welfare tax] On 3 September last year, Prime  Minister Hosokawa, based on an agreement among the ruling  parties, asked the Tax Commission to draw up drastic tax reform  measures. In October, the Tax Commission reached a conclusion  and announced reform measures. At that time, the mass media and  political circles had hot debates over the reform measures. The  debates included all questions currently being discussed. I  mean questions concerning implementing tax cuts to shore up the  economy and deal with the aging society, balancing income,  consumption, and asset taxes, and increasing the consumption tax  to fund large-scale tax cuts. The size of the tax hike and  reductions were also discussed. Moreover, whether or not to use  the term "welfare tax" was discussed by the Tax Commission. If  the Liberal Democratic Party were in power, it would have spent  about one month discussing the tax reform. But at that time,  the Hosokawa government had to deal with the Uruguay Round talks  and the political reform issue. As a result, tax reform  discussions came to halt. Nevertheless, the ruling parties have  continued tax reform debates. Also, the government established  the Economic Affairs Committee to continue the discussions.  Therefore, from our viewpoint, it was quite natural that the  idea of creating a welfare tax cropped up during discussions.  If you review media reports, you will know that the government  has continued tax reform discussions. But because everybody  focused on the political reform issue and the government had to  settle other grave issues in such a short period, it looked as  if the welfare tax proposal appeared abruptly.    [Kumagai answering Tawara's question as to whether he  supports Hosokawa's plan of adopting a 7 percent welfare tax in  1997 to fund 6 trillion yen tax cuts] From long-term viewpoints  and to balance all taxes, I think it is necessary to carry out  the plan. So I support the plan.    [Passage omitted on Kumagai remarks on the need to adopt the  welfare tax to make tax cuts possible and to deal with the aging  society]    [Kumagai answering Tawara's question as to how the  government  intends to handle Hosokawa's tax hike and reduction plans,  whether it will compromise with the Social Democratic Party of  Japan (SDPJ) over the plans] It is difficult for me to answer  the question since I am a member of the government. But I  support the plans as I said earlier. At any rate, the  government has to reach a conclusion in two days and the  conclusion should be agreed upon by all ruling parties. I think  the agreement among the ruling parties is important. I would  like to say to the SDPJ that should the Hosokawa cabinet,  ignoring financial conditions, decide on a plan to implement tax  cuts without securing revenue sources to fund the cuts, the  public will totally lose their trust in the cabinet. Therefore,  the cabinet has to implement tax cuts while securing revenue  sources. I hope you will understand this.    [Kumagai refuting Tawara's criticism that Prime Minister  Hosokawa retracted so easily his tax reform plans immediately  after the plans drew criticism] Prime Minister Hosokawa has not  changed his stance. Although the prime minister has agreed to  take his tax reform plans back to the drawing board and have the  representatives of the ruling parties discuss them again, he has  stated that his stance has not changed. He has asked the  representatives of the ruling parties to decide on measures to  fund tax cuts if they agree to implement them. Nonetheless, tax  reform is a grave issue. In the past, it rocked the LDP-led  Ohira, Nakasone, and Takeshita cabinets. At one time, about 80  to 90 percent of LDP members were opposed to the tax reform.  But I believe the Hosokawa cabinet is strong enough to tide  over the current difficulties.</p>

The complete application is available for a fee at the SEC's Public Reference Branch. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants' Representations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. The Company, a Delaware corporation, is a newly formed non-diversified closed-end management company that has elected to operate as a business development company under the Act. The Company has filed a registration statement on Form N&hyph;2 (File No. 33&hyph;50424) with respect to an initial public offering of its common stock. The registration statement has not yet been declared effective by the SEC. The Company's primary investment objective will be to achieve long-term capital appreciation through controlling (25% or greater) investments in ``eligible portfolio companies'' (as defined in the Act). The Company will invest in portfolio companies with viable existing businesses generating substantial revenues in established markets, but that have recently completed, are in the process of undergoing, or are likely to undergo, a financial restructuring pursuant to bankruptcy or reorganization proceedings or on a negotiated basis outside of bankruptcy or reorganization proceedings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The Investment Adviser is a registered investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the ``Advisers Act''). The Company has retained the Investment Adviser as the Company's investment adviser to identify, negotiate, manage and liquidate investments for the Company.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Martin D. Sass and Hugh R. Lamle, who are officers and directors of the Company, are principal stockholders, officers and directors of the Investment Adviser. James B. Rubin, an officer and director of the Company and Martin E. Winter, an officer of the Company, are also officers of the Investment Adviser. In addition, Messrs. Sass and Lamle are principal stockholders, officers, and directors of two other investment advisers registered under the Advisers Act, M.D. Sass Associates, Inc. (``Associates'') and M.D. Sass Management, Inc. (``Management''). Messrs. Rubin and Winter are also officers of Associates and Management. The Investment Adviser, Associates and Management control other entities engaged in investing primarily in financially distressed companies (the ``M.D. Sass Funds''). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. None of the M.D. Sass Funds has made or presently proposes to make a public offering of its securities. Each of the M.D. Sass Funds: (a) Is exempt from registration under the Act pursuant to section 3(c)(1) because its outstanding securities are beneficially owned by less than 100 persons; or (b) is not subject to registration under section 7(d) because it is not organized or otherwise created under the laws of the United States or any state and has not made use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce in connection with any public offering of its securities. The M.D. Sass Funds and those entities not subject to the registration requirements of the Act that may be subsequently created or otherwise organized by the Investment Adviser or affiliates of the Investment Adviser are referred to as the ``M.D. Sass Affiliates.'' The Company proposes to co-invest with the M.D. Sass Affiliates in order to acquire a diversified portfolio of investments and to compete effectively for such investments with larger entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants' Legal Analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Section 17(d) and rule 17d&hyph;1 thereunder provide, among other things, that it shall be unlawful for an affiliate person of an investment company, or an affiliated of such person, acting as principal, to participate in any joint enterprise or other joint arrangement in which any such investment company is a participant, unless the SEC has issued an order approving the joint enterprise or arrangement. Section 57(a)(4) applies the same prohibitions to affiliated persons of a business development company. Section 57(i) applies the rules adopted under section 17(d) to business development companies.  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

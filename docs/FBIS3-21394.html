Khergamvala] </F>   [Text] Manama (Bahrain), Jan. 25--On a day when the  Pakistan Prime Minister, Ms Benazir Bhutto, was talking about  jugular veins, iron curtains and preconditions, India's visiting  Minister of State for External Affairs, Mr. R.L. Bhatia, got  emphatic support from two Gulf regimes for a strict bilateral  approach to resolving the Kashmir dispute.    In Kuwait and in Bahrain where Mr. Bhatia met the top  echelons of the leadership the hosts made two points, in  addition to the routine but important message about the  contribution of the Indian community to development in these  places. One, that they are glad that talks between India and  Pakistan have been resumed and next, that these must continue if  a solution is to be found.    Noteworthy: Lest this sounds like a daily  exhortation coming from one part of the world or the other to  India and Pakistan, a specific nuance that injected itself into  these views from top Gulf leaders is noteworthy, especially  because this is the first time it has been made. In Kuwait,  sources say the term avoidance of "internationalisation" of the  resolution mechanism was used. However internationalised the  dispute already is, this usage was music to Indian official  ears, especially after unfounded rumours that Kuwait had joined  Saudi Arabia, Bosnia and the United Arab Emirates in agreeing to  sponsor a resolution against India on human rights violations.  Officials from both sides declined to identify the specific  Kuwait leader who used the term. The inference could be drawn  that it was either the Amir of Kuwait, Sheikh Jabir or the Crown  Prince and Prime Minister, Sheikh Sa'd.    Bahrain chose to make the same point using another logic.  Bahraini officials point to their own live dispute with Qatar  over the ownership of some islands and the maritime boundary.  Qatar has taken the dispute unilaterally to the International  Court of Justice (ICJ) but Bahrain has challenged in the first  instance, the right of Qatar to go to the ICJ unilaterally. The  message conveyed to Mr. Bhatia was that only direct disputants  can find the appropriate avenue to resolving a problem. It need  hardly be emphasised that especially in this region the events  surrounding the broader Arab-Israeli dispute are being shaped  through direct bilateral channels between Israel on the one hand  and the other Arab parties on the other.    Published announcement: It would be a mistake to  interpret the stands of Kuwait and Bahrain as being supportive  of India on Kashmir but India should be gratified that the  approach advocated by it had found an echo and been explained  through the logic of the circumstances in which these regimes  find themselves and the broader trends in the region. Bahrain  and Kuwait had one other stated and published announcement. This  time for the ears of the Pakistan opposition leader, Mr. Nawaz  Sharif, and the "Prime Minister of Azad Kashmir." Both of them  have been shouting themselves hoarse about sanctions against  India by the Gulf. On the day Mr. Bhatia arrived in Kuwait Mr.  Sharif appealed to the Organisation of Islamic Conference (OIC)  to call for sanctions against India.    Two facts respond to these appeals. One, made in Kuwait and  Bahrain about the contribution of the disciplined Indian  community and, another in the 1993 annual trade figures just  published by Bahrain. Imports from India increased by 20 percent  to $87.5 millions and exports to India nearly doubled to $56  millions. Pakistan bought only $8.5 millions worth of goods from  Bahrain and does not figure on the list of major sources of  exports. Also for Mr. Sharif's information is the fact that in  Saudi Arabia the number of Indians working has jumped to a  million. The Amir of Kuwait's visit to India is being scheduled.  Iran's Speaker is to visit India. The Saudis have just nominated  an Ambassador to India and positioned a military attache  recently in New Delhi.    Investments: In comments to newspersons Mr. Bhatia  by and large gave an economic-cum-investments spin to the  "goodwill" visit. Considering that India does not even know  about Kuwait's offset investments programme which could bring  money into India, if there was one aspect that Mr. Bhatia did  not discuss, it was investments. Both Gulf countries agreed to  send chamber of commerce delegations, which is not saying very  much. Bahrain also agreed to hold its joint committee meeting  with India in four months.    Mr. Bhatia's mission, timed and designed to preempt Pakistan  gaining an advantage in these countries seemed to suffer from an  old rigid syndrome. Gulf countries have changed. There are  consultative or elected assemblies. Though Mr. Bhatia did meet  the rulers and other top leaders as well as the Speaker of the  Kuwaiti Assembly, the effort next time should be on speaking to  politicians on various Assembly committees. The one dominant  issue in the assemblies is the subject of manpower imports and  human rights in countries with Muslim minorities, both of very  direct concern to India.</p>

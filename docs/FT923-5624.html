			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow closes slightly firmer in light trading Wall Street US share prices moved in a narrow, slightly firmer range in light trading yesterday as the latest economic figures and lower bond prices had little impact on investors, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 12.97 at 3,267.61, the index having spent all day hovering a few points above Thursday's close. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was also a touch firmer, up 1.30 at 414.83, while the Amex composite was 0.18 firmer at 381.18 and the Nasdaq composite 0.33 higher at 563.60. Turnover on the NYSE was only 153m shares, and rises outpaced declines by 925 to 748. The day's economic news had little impact on market sentiment. Government officials reported that personal income rose 0.2 per cent while personal spending was up by 0.3 per cent in July. The figures were in line with expectations, and again illustrated the sluggish nature of the economic recovery. Investors also shrugged off a modest drop in bond prices, which was prompted by slight weakness in the dollar. Overall, stock market sentiment was flat, and with many participants taking off early for the weekend, trading activity was light. Among individual stocks, Dow Chemical jumped Dollars 2 to Dollars 56 1/2 after the company was named 'Long-View Number One Stock of the Week' by the broking house Merrill Lynch, which set a 12-month to 18-month price target of Dollars 85 for the stock. General Motors fell Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 33 1/2 after the company announced that it is seeking a buyer for its worldwide bearing business which is spread over three sites in the US and Spain, and which employs about 3,000 workers. GM stock was also suffering a reaction to recent gains on hopes of better car sales. Among other car stocks, Ford lost Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 39 3/4 , and Chrysler was Dollars  3/8 lower at Dollars 19 1/8 . RJR Nabisco fell early on but ended unchanged at Dollars 8 5/8 after Ms Diana Temple, sector analyst at Salomon Brothers, reduced her 1992 earnings estimate for RJR from 62 cents a share to 57 cents a share, and for 1993 from Dollars 1 a share to 80 cents a share. Ms Temple is the third analyst in the last two weeks to lower earnings estimates for RJR. Hopes that Hurricane Andrew will prompt a turn in the depressed insurance pricing cycle lifted insurance broking stocks, among them Marsh &amp; Mclennan, up Dollars 3 1/8 at Dollars 82 7/8 . Canada TORONTO stocks closed slightly higher in light trading activity, as the TSE 300 Composite Index gained 10.34 points, or 0.30 per cent to close at 3402.94. On the week, the index was up about 13 points. Advances led declines 305 to 201. Gold stocks were up for the second consecutive day, rising 2.15% on index. In that group, American Barrick jumped CDollars 1 1/4 to CDollars 36 1/2 . In all, eight of the 14 stock groups closed higher. Banking and energy were up moderately, and mining, industrial products and consumer products were all little changed.</p>

			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / Letter: Maastricht treaty contains seeds of its own destruction Sir, Your 'A vote for Europe' editorial (November 2) lets down the normally excellent standards of your newspaper. The answer to the question, 'if not Maastricht, what?' is simple and clear - the Treaty of Rome and the Single European Act, both already in place. I am talking of the Common Market (remember the phrase?), for which the British people voted in a referendum, the largest customs union in the world. The Maastricht treaty contains the seeds of its own destruction, for precious few member states will achieve the convergence criteria to bring the single currency into effect in the foreseeable future. In that case, you may ask, what harm to ratify it? Great harm. It is a distraction from the real needs of the economies of Europe, a monstrous time-waster. Worse, the Conservative party has no heart for it: neither does the nation, and nor does Europe as a whole. Denmark voted No, France Yes. Yet the messages from Denmark and France are identical: there is no consensus for Maastricht. And there is none in Germany. While a simple parliamentary majority may suffice for day-to-day decisions, surely we cannot allow major constitutional changes affecting the citizenship of ourselves and our grandchildren to pass in the absence of wholehearted consent. Still less can we do so in order to save Mr Major embarrassment in Edinburgh. Mr Major has already found out the hard way that you can't buck the markets. He has yet to learn that you can't buck the people either. Roger Helmer, Suite 29, Suisse Grand Hotel, 201-1, Hongeun-Dong, Suhdaimoon-Ku, Seoul 120, Korea</p>

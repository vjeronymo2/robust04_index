			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Books: High on Victorian obsessions - Fiction ANGELS AND INSECTS by A S Byatt Chatto &amp; Windus, Pounds 14.99, 290 pages IN THE SECOND of two novellas in this volume, the poet Tennyson hears 'the buzzing of little flying fragments of language that hung around his head all the time in a cloud . . .', and henceforth I will always see AS Byatt through a similar cloud of buzzing fragments. Her mastery of the High Victorian style was demonstrated in her prize-winning 1990 novel, Possession, but like many readers I found its lengthy sections of pastiche difficult to enjoy. But here, AS Byatt communicates a love of words and a delight in their diversity and power that amounts, at times, to a giddy infatuation. The combination of high spirits and erudition is both challenging and exciting. Both novellas are quite separate. Morpho Eugenia refers to a large Amazonian butterfly and is the lighter and funnier of the two. It concerns a young entomologist, William Anderson, penniless after a shipwreck on his way back from the Amazon. He is offered work and hospitality by one of his patrons, Sir Harald Alabaster. William is absorbed into the teeming Alabaster household, where he resumes his entomological activities, providing a glass hive and glass ant-hill for the younger children and a 'cloud of butterflies' for the beautiful eldest daughter, Eugenia. In defiance of the conventions of Victorian realism, the penniless hero is given Eugenia's hand in marriage. Eugenia then retires, queen ant-like, into an all-absorbing reproductive cycle (twins twice, giving a total of five babies in three years) while her husband argues Darwin with Sir Harald and studies ants with the younger children and their companion, Matty Crompton. Matty, in spite of her lowly status as poor relation, has a considerable intellect. While there are obvious parallels between the ant-hills they observe so closely and the Alabaster household, Matty would extend this to the Industrial Revolution and the American Civil War: 'analogy is a slippery tool', says William. 'Men are not ants.' And yet, in a sense, the reader is presented with one vast analogy, which is also fairy tale, fable, parody and allegory. The Darwinian debates with Sir Harald and extracts from books written by William and Matty add to the prismatic effect, while on the realistic level narrative conventions of the time are again defied to provide our hero - and heroine - with a happy ending. The title of The Conjugial Angel sent me straight to the dictionary where I made the useful discovery that 'conjugial' was used by Swedenborg in preference to 'conjugal'. Ah, the pleasures of erudition] This emerges in any case from the account that follows of two seances held in 1875 in the Margate home of Emily Tennyson Jesse. She was previously engaged to Arthur Henry Hallam, whose death in 1833 inspired her brother's poem In Memoriam. One of the mediums, Lilias Papagay, a clever touch, is the wife of the Captain in whose ship the hero of the previous novella returns to the Amazon: he has been missing for ten years, probably dead. The Swedenborgian theorist, a Mr Hawke, is one of several characters whose condescension illustrates just how frustrating it must have been to be a woman of intellect in Victorian times. 'Mrs Papagay was an intelligent, questioning kind of woman, the kind who, in an earlier age, would have been a theologically-minded nun and in a later one would have had a university training in philosophy . . . She did not know much history, though she had read all the novels of Walter Scott . . .' The matter here is more directly literary with long passages of Tennyson and Hallam requiring a leisurely approach. AS Byatt deals with another set of Victorian obsessions here: theology, angels, the after-life and, of course, the conjugial. But Byatt is a compulsive story-teller and although the telling of a story is not her prime concern, she does it extremely well. That, and her ebullient use of language, are characteristics shared by both these highly-accomplished novellas, the work of a first-class writer on top form.</p>

			<p><P> July 10, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN;  </P> <P> ZONING PANEL REJECTS HIGHER-DENSITY PLAN  </P> <P> The Planning Commission on Monday unanimously rejected a developer's request to  rezone a recently annexed parcel.  </P> <P> The rezoning would have paved the way for the development of up to 25  condominiums.  </P> <P> When the 2.3-acre area at Holt and Warren avenues was annexed in 1989, some  North Tustin residents opposed it, saying Tustin would rezone it to allow  multifamily dwellings instead of the five houses that are there now.  </P> <P> Sixty North Tustin residents spoke against the proposal Monday, saying the  zoning change would hurt the open character of their neighborhood and increase  traffic congestion and noise. "We asked the city of Tustin not to increase the  density," said Stephen Johnson of Foothill Communities Assn. in a presentation  that drew loud applause.  </P> <P> The city planning staff recommended denial of the zoning change. Planning  commissioners said the zoning change could hurt the city's credibility and  future efforts to annex North Tustin properties.  </P> <P> "The city gave its word. I do not believe it is appropriate at this time to  make the change," Commissioner Alven Baker said.  </P> <P> The zoning change was proposed by Dennis Paquette, who has said he would buy  three parcels in the area to build condominiums.SHANNON SANDS  </P></p>

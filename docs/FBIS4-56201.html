			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Maribel Acosta] </F>   [Text] We all know that the special session of the National  Assembly of the People's Government [ANPP] will be held on May  Day to give continuity to the debate on the national financial  situation. The public debate process of the workers assemblies  was conducted between January and March. This process  highlighted for the ANPP the policies to be followed.    In accordance with a poll conducted nationwide in March by  the Sociology Studies Center among 1,404 workers, 87 percent  believe that the workers assembly process was worthwhile.  Likewise, 71 percent of the workers affirmed that the workplace  debates contributed to creating an awareness of the true  situation of the Cuban economy. Regarding the proposals and  suggested measures to streamline the internal finances, 56  percent of the workers believe that the measures will gradually  solve [passage indistinct], while seven percent do not see a  relation between measures and an improvement in the Cuban  economy.    Statistics reveal that it is evident there is a high  consensus on the need for economic measures, although, opinions  differ on the shape they ought to take. Some 39 percent of the  workers believe that the measures ought to be taken separately  and gradually; 25 percent believe the measures should be taken  separately but quickly; and 27 percent believe the measures  should be taken quickly and all at once. According to this poll,  which also shows a high level of democracy in the opinions  expressed, the measures with more widespread support are  reducing frivolous gratuities, eliminating the regulated sale of  cigarettes and rum, increasing the cost of electricity the  higher the consumption, and implementing a more active price  policy aimed at subsidizing people rather than products.    However, in my opinion, we ought to give more attention to  certain indicators revealed by the poll. For example, there is  not a clear enough understanding that economic measures will  affect everyone's living conditions to a different degree.  Fifty-five percent of the workers responded yes to the question:  Should we all receive the same? This shows a deeply rooted  egalitarianism. The poll also confirms the people's consensus on  the need to work more and shows the value of public discussion  when 64 percent of the workers stated that the country will move  ahead.    The opinion of the specialists is that the workers  assemblies  yielded the positive result of increasing trust and hope in the  possibility of Cuba's reversing the current economic situation.    On May Day the ANPP will meet; we know the expectations. The  ANPP will debate, compliment the consensus, and draft policies  on how to solve the current financial situation. Then it becomes  the government's responsibility to implement the policies  drafted by the ANPP.</p>

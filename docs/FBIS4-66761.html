			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Sa'd Matashar: "Doctors' Fees"] </F>   [Text] "Uncle Kazim," 60, is a retired villager. They  prescribed a specialist in Baghdad for him and told him that  this doctor would find him a cure and would end his struggle  with the disease. The man borrowed a sum of money, left part of  it with his family, and came to the capital with 300 Iraqi  dinars [ID] in his pocket. According to his account, his family  would have been delighted when he returned in sound health. The  man went to Baghdad, from street to street and bus to bus, until  he found his way to the doctor's clinic, but he was shocked to  find that admission to the doctor was "commercial." He asked for  an explanation, and they told him: If you are in a hurry, you  have to pay more to enter before others. If you have no money,  register and wait. The man heard this advice and said to  himself: I'll wait; it is better and less costly. He was  directed to the secretary so that he could register, but a major  disaster occurred because the examination fee was ID100.  <H5>  Medical Specialists and Practitioners Abuse Price Schedule </H5> for Medical Services    The story of Uncle Kazim is an appropriate entry into the  world of medicine and into a discussion of the fees of doctors  and their private clinics. Come with us to the world of the  angels of mercy.    Medicine is not a business. The complaints we hear about  high  fees and the high cost of drugs, tests, and medical analyses  should not be extended or generalized to the rest of private  clinics, which are still maintaining their humaneness. The story  of exploiting medicine and selling it on sidewalks and in  bandage shops must be ended.    Every citizen has the right to treatment and medicine, and  he  must be able to obtain them without being exploited. How can  that be achieved? Some of these clinics have very unfortunately  been turned into profit-seeking commercial centers and are  trading on people's illnesses, especially those people who  cannot pay the price to restore their health.    For many years, the state has enjoyed excellent health  planning, which begins at the point of citizen health awareness  and never ends, because medicine is an ever-changing science,  advancing minute by minute. From the start, the state has  enacted laws eliminating exploitation and monopolization,  liberating the citizen from the "deceit" that was being  practiced by some, and moving toward "openness," so that the  citizen may be free of ailments. Our society has rid itself of  all that, thanks to the Iraqi citizen's cultural growth and the  expansion of his scientific understanding.    Because we do not wish to return to that dark age in the  life  of our people, we must put a stop to the high fees of doctors'  private clinics. The doctor in his clinic should be more relaxed  and ready to talk and listen to the patient, in contrast to the  situation in the hospital. Certainly, the doctor should think  about his private clinic's reputation and seek clients for it.  If he only had the same feelings about his work in the hospital,  perhaps the picture would change. Some doctors comment on this  situation, saying that analyzing the situation in this way does  doctors a disservice, since the patient is the same, as is the  disease and the medicine. However, many are referred to the  hospital, and the severe overcrowding causes the doctor not to  give the same care to the referred patient. Perhaps he cannot  diagnose the patient's condition. We have heard that certain  doctors in hospitals suffer from that a great deal, with the  number of patients referred reaching up to 1,000 a day, and  sometimes even more!    This excuse might be acceptable, but why the excessively  high  fees for the examination? Is it reasonable for fees to be ID100  in certain private clinics? In certain dental clinics, the cost  goes up to ID1,000 when the visit is repeated. The fee to pull a  tooth is ID100. Those who cannot pay suffer from toothaches.  Should one have to suffer from a toothache? May God protect us  and you from the evil of pain. Who is responsible for monitoring  doctors' clinics, their fees, and their violations? There are  many medical clinics that have a sign bearing the medical  specialist's name, but the general practitioner who works there  demands a specialist's fees. We think that sometimes there are  two signs for one doctor: the first with the name of a general  practitioner and the second with the name of a specialist!    We have become convinced that lack of supervision has made  matters lax. Violations have become complaints that everybody  talks about, despite the fact that doctors' official fees are  set by law and are ID10 for a specialist and ID5 for a general  practitioner. Therefore, receiving a payment that is more than  that is a clear and distinct violation of the law.    The practical certainty is that diagnosis is half the  treatment and perhaps requires the patient to visit  laboratories, undergo analysis and examinations, and have X  rays. The cost of these services has become excessively high.  Doing the simplest analysis is not less than ID50; X rays exceed  ID100, and the simplest visit to these laboratories costs ID500  and, sometimes, as high as ID1,000.    As for the reason for these high prices, we have heard from  many doctors that some of it is because of the blockade, the  high prices that the medical market demands, and the current  shortage of solutions used in analytical processes, which are  imported materials that the iniquitous blockade keeps out of the  country and the prices of which have become unreal. This cost is  inevitably obtained from the patient, but the consideration is  not always money, since there is a greater issue, man's health.  From what we have also heard, there are erroneous diagnoses as a  result of using commercial medical analytic solutions that are  not of the same caliber of medical solutions that used to be  imported by the state.    Some doctors have converted their private clinics into  hospitals in which the patient finds various therapeutic  services. We do not call these services harmful, but they might  be unnecessary or of no value to the referred patient. However,  the doctor suggests having them, and each one costs something.  In the clinic of one doctor who specializes in fractures and  bone surgery, we have seen a room for natural treatment, another  for orthopedics, a third room for examinations, and a hall for  physical therapy. In order that the patient may reach a certain  degree of recovery, he must periodically be referred to have  physical therapy and pass through all of these rooms, all the  while paying the fees.    Patient 'Ala' Hamid underwent an ankle operation in Dr.  H.K.'s clinic. The operation cost him ID5,000, which was just  the doctor's fee; ID1,000 in fees for the hospital room; and  nearly ID500 for medicine. Since the operation two months ago,  he has paid nearly ID2,000 and is still being referred to his  private doctor because he has not completely healed. He pays for  each referral. I asked him: What do you do?    [Hamid] I'm a government employee.    [Matashar] Where did you get the money?    [Hamid] This money was for emergencies, and I spent it in  the  hospital.    [Matashar] Why didn't you have the operation in a government  hospital?    [Hamid] They advised me in the national hospital, and I took  their word.    [Matashar] Why?    [Hamid] One day after the operation, they put me out. I paid  my money and my referrals to the doctor's clinic began. I even  sold my wife's gold, and the journey continues.    Another patient told us about the quest for treatment for  his  illness (heart). He said: "God is the healer. Health is great  happiness. One does not know its value, until it is lost, God  forbid.    [Matashar] How about doctors' fees?    [Patient] Doctors are human beings...they are good persons.  They help the sick and are generous with them. I have been  referred to many clinics, and I have seen those who pay their  examination fees out of their daily food money. There are  doctors who set aside one day a week to see the poor. I was one  who was referred on this day. This doctor hung a sign that said  that the examination and treatment were free for those who could  not pay.    On the other hand, there are private clinics with exorbitant  prices. They have reached the point of not being able to  differentiate between black and white. Money becomes the primary  concern. It is strange that we have begun to hear about the  urgent reservation and the ordinary reservation. This is  inhumane. It is not right to expose our society to this, because  treatment and medicine should be for all, not just for the  wealthy but not the poor. We also question whether the blockade  has affected food supplies and medicine. Is it true that it  affects humanitarian dealings? The answer, of course, is well  known.    The private dental clinics attract unhappy talk. Fees in  these clinics have reached abnormal heights. The extraction of a  tooth, ID100; simple gum therapy, ID75; examination, ID50;  ordinary filling, ID100; root filling, ID300; operation to  extract a wisdom tooth, ID500; manufacture and fitting of a  movable tooth, ID300; fixed tooth, ID400; manufacture of a full  set of teeth, ID1,000.    In Dr. J.K.'s clinic, which specializes in internal and  heart  diseases, we broached the matter with one of those referred. She  was a doctor who came with one of her ailing relatives because  she was acquainted with the doctor's skill and his knowledge. He  is a professor at the Medical College and a fellow of the  largest medical college in the world. This doctor--the  referral--thinks the problem of rising medical fees has become  apparent in the last few years. It is a case that is linked to  the general situation and should not be overblown or  media-hyped. The problem will end when matters are stabilized.  We asked her: Why did it appear recently?    She said: "Because medicine is a skill. The doctor has a  right to take an appropriate fee in exchange for his skill or  service that he gives to the citizen. The doctor is also a human  being who deserves a certain standard of living, along with a  car and the ownership of a home, so that he feels that his work  has not been in vain."    Good, but those who cannot pay?    "I don't believe that there are those who cannot pay. Even  if  such a person is found, he has government hospitals; their doors  are open to all."    But the patient seeks the best service.    "Yes, everything has a price."    We spoke with another referral, named Sami 'Abdallah. We  asked him, what's the problem?    He said: "When you are referred, the doctor in the  government  hospital deals with you in a sullen manner. You are then forced  to visit him in his private clinic, and, when you buy his full  services, you are welcomed with a smiling face."    Another patient said: "Doctors are not the only problem."    What is the problem?    "Medicine and searching for someone who sells it. Making the  rounds of pharmacies and bandage shops. The black market."    As opposed to our findings on this tour, there was a  contrary  view. Dr. A.S. talked to us about the concerns of doctors, which  start with establishing the clinic. In Baghdad, this costs  ID150,000 in areas far from the city center, while on the main  streets it reaches ID500,000 and perhaps ID1 million. There is  also the cost of medical equipment. Some systems cost ID100,000  or ID150,000, but they are necessary in private clinics. In  addition, there are the high costs of services, such as rent,  secretarial, etc. There are other reasons for the wave of  universally high costs, which are linked to the iniquitous  blockade imposed upon our country. With regard to the doctor's  humaneness, our interlocutor said:    "It is unreasonable to think that a doctor would not be  humane. First, and above all, he has compassion. Therefore, he  does not begrudge helping those who need it. I don't believe  that any doctor would refuse to offer his services to the ill."    It only remains to say that the Physicians Union, to which  we  offered a summary of this report, apparently intends not to  intervene in this problem. It preferred to remain silent,  despite our insistence in obtaining its opinion. However, the  Cabinet has formed a special committee to study doctors' fees,  preparatory to drafting a special price list. This committee is  composed of representatives from the Ministry of Health, the  Physicians Union, and other agencies.</p>

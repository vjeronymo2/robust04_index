			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed Jean-Paul Croize: "An Ill-Fated Third </F> Stage"]    [Text] For the engineers there is no question of rethinking  the technical concepts on which the European launcher is based.  They claim: "It is a one-off problem relating to a part  failure or a machining accident for one of the components in the  third stage."    Nevertheless, Ariane's third stage, based on the use of a  cryotechnical engine that is extremely difficult to master since  it is fueled by a mixture of liquid hydrogen and oxygen at minus  251 degrees Celsius and minus 184 degrees Celsius respectively,  is really the "ill-fated" part of the launcher, since it has led  to four of the six failed flights.    The initial technical data once again clearly points the  finger at this third stage, and more specifically its engine.  After several operations engineers spoke at Kourou of a "loss  of pressure" when the failure occurred, the theory was  postulated of a failed roller bearing in the engine's turbopump.  It seems that initial flight data analyses soon showed the  bearing to be heating up. This would have led to it blocking  and prematurely stopping the turbopump injecting hydrogen and  oxygen into the combustion chamber.    Weighing some 30 kg, this turbopump is without doubt the  most  fragile Ariane component. It delivers 400 kilowatts of power,  the same as a high speed train, and rotates at 63,000 rpm.  Throughout its 600 seconds of operation in normal flight it has  to undergo extreme stress, and is less than 50 cm from  temperatures of minus 251 degrees Celsius at the hydrogen  injection point and plus 1,500 degrees Celsius in the combustion  chamber.    Without re-examining the design of the engine itself, it is  clear that even the slightest machining error or flaw in the  alloys can have devastating consequences.</p>

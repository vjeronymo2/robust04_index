			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / Bundesbank cuts rates by half percentage point: Surprise German move eases pressure on weak ERM currencies THE GERMAN Bundesbank cut its discount and Lombard rates by half a percentage point each yesterday, triggering a spate of rate cuts across continental Europe. The surprise move eased pressures on several weak currencies in the European exchange rate mechanism. Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US Treasury secretary, said in Washington that the cut would 'help strengthen world growth and create jobs'. The German central bank agreed at a meeting of its decision-making council to cut its discount rate, which sets the floor for German money rates, to 5.75 per cent. The Lombard rate, which it uses to lend emergency funds to banks against collateral, was lowered to 6.75 per cent. The move - which followed a similar half a percentage point reduction in both rates on September 9 - was followed by cuts in interest rates in the Netherlands, Belgium, Italy, Austria and Switzerland. Sweden had anticipated the German move by cutting rates earlier in the day. Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the new Bundesbank president, said the cut marked an adaptation to economic changes. Factors influencing the decision included the revaluation, in effect, of the D-Mark against other currencies since the widening of the ERM's fluctuation bands at the beginning of August. But he said the bank's policy was not driven by exchange rate considerations, nor was it affected by other people's thinking or requirements. 'We cannot be a central bank for Europe.' Asked about recent tensions in the ERM, notably affecting the Belgian franc, he said he hoped they were temporary. Yesterday's decision appeared to have been heavily influenced by poor prospects for a domestically-driven recovery from recession. German economists expect internal demand to remain weak well into next year. On Bundesbank calculations, the German economy has yet to show signs of recovery. Third quarter gross domestic product was expected to be unchanged from the second quarter, Mr Tietmeyer said. The bank was trying to support recovery 'within the limits of its powers'. The Bundesbank also cut its 'repo' rate, with which it provides liquidity to the banking system, to 6.4 per cent from 6.67 per cent. Although neither France nor Britain took advantage of the boost the German move gave to their currencies against the D-Mark by cutting borrowing rates, stock markets in both countries moved ahead strongly on the expectation of moves to ease borrowing conditions. On the Paris bourse, shares surged by 2.3 per cent while in London the FT-SE 100 index of leading shares gained 32 points to close at 3,188.3, for the second consecutive record closing high. Elsewhere, share prices on the Zurich and Amsterdam bourses moved ahead by about 1 per cent. Currency markets saw heavy selling of the D-Mark as investors shifted funds into the US dollar. The dollar rose nearly two pfennigs against the D-Mark in London to DM1.6635 and the pound closed more than two pfennigs higher on the day at DM2.4725. Both currencies were at similar levels in late New York trading. The French franc rebounded by two centimes to FFr3.5120 against the D-Mark in London as investors anticipated an early rate cut, and edged higher to FFr3.5055 in New York. The Belgian franc was hampered by doubts over the social pact on wages and employment, particularly after unions walked out of negotiations. The currency staged a more choppy recovery, but closed against the D-Mark in London at BFr21.67, up from BFr21.82.

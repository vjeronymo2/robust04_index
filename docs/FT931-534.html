			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Beijing gears up for speedy reform CHINA yesterday installed a younger, more technocratic government to spearhead speedy economic reform demanded by its ageing leader, Mr Deng Xiaoping. The National People's Congress, or parliament, also accepted a new constitution that enshrines Mr Deng's capitalist-style economic reforms and confirms China's opening to the outside world. Mr Zhu Rongji, 65, known as China's economic 'czar', was elevated to the post of senior vice-premier with specific responsibility of ensuring that Mr Deng's reformist legacy is preserved. The NPC also approved one of the largest government reshuffles in history with 22 new ministers out of 41, including the appointment of Madam Wu Yi, who heads the powerful Trade Ministry and is regarded as a rising star. New vice premiers include Mr Qian Qichen, 65, who also retains his post as foreign minister, and Mr Li Lanqing, 61, the former trade minister. The fourth vice premier is Mr Zou Jiahua, 67, who has already served one five-year term. China's new constitution - the fifth since the founding of the People's Republic - embraces the phrase 'socialist market economy' to describe the country's capitalist-style reforms that produced an economic growth rate last year nearing 13 per cent. The constitutional change mirrors resolutions adopted at the 14th Communist party conference last October which gave formal blessing to the move away from rigid central economic control. China's new leadership is meant to provide both the expertise and commitment needed to underpin the country's economic revolution once Mr Deng, who has aged noticeably in the past year, leaves the scene. This eighth NPC since 1949 - China's parliaments meet annually and run for five-year terms - has also provided Mr Deng and his reformist supporters with an opportunity to strengthen the collective leadership. The appointment of Mr Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the Communist party and chairman of the Military Commission, to the additional post of state president is part of this process.

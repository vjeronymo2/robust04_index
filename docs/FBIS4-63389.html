			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Sergey Shakhray, former Russian minister of </F> nationalities and regional policy, by an unidentified  correspondent; place and date not given; from the "Novosti"  newscast -- recorded]    [Text] [Correspondent] Sergey Mikhaylovich, many people  link your dismissal as minister for the affairs of nationalities  and regional policy with your stand at the talks with Chechnya,  and with the situation in the North Caucasus in general. Is  that really the case?    [Shakhray] I do not think there is a direct link here. Even  if there is, I still believe that decisions on personnel matters  should be made by the prime minister and the president on their  own, without prompts or recommendations from Chechen President  Dzhokhar Dudayev, as some hinted was the case. I should like to  say this is not a question of a certain personal stand of mine.  There is a presidential message in which the policy toward  Chechnya is formulated; there is a State Duma resolution.  Therefore, I believe that all the federal bodies of state  power--the Federation Council with its head, the State Duma, and  the government--should act along the lines that have been  defined, both in political and in legal terms, rather than  conjure up some inventions of their own. After all, there  should be elementary order in the country.    Incidentally, my resignation statement is connected with the  breach of elementary procedures and order. On the one hand, I  have been retained as a deputy prime minister in charge of the  nationalities and regional policy, and on the other, a minister  of whom I have not heard anything has been appointed to cover  the same area.    [Correspondent] Do you foresee any more serious changes in  the cabinet?    [Shakhray] I believe there will be no drastic upheavals and  reshuffles.    [Correspondent] You mean, there will be no such proposal  from  the prime minister himself?    [Shakhray] You may have noticed that the prime minister,  using his vast experience, believes that an old hand is better  than two new ones. He prefers not to change his personnel, his  ministers, as one changes one's gloves, but to work with the  cadres he has. My personal feeling is that Prime Minister  Viktor Chernomyrdin will not allow any reshuffles in the  government.</p>

			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WATTS, 25 YEARS POST-REBELLION  </P> <P> The hair raises on the back of my neck every time I come across a comment like  Robert Conot's ("Watts: Out of the Fire" Opinion, Aug. 5) that the cause of the  "increasing disparity" between black and white people's income is because black  students "have not been receiving" the education necessary for them to get  well-paying jobs.  </P> <P> Here it goes again, I shudder at this point, another of the common diatribes  against supposedly racist white teachers who deliberately prevent black  students from getting the education they need for future financial success.  </P> <P> What an immense restorative it was to read Conot's unusual yet correct  assessment of the problem of scholastic underachievement among blacks: "Schools  are one-half the equation. Home is the other."  </P> <P> Educators accept the vital need, for example, of early education programs for  black children like Head Start, and for making schoolwork interesting and  meaningful for them. It is now time for black leaders to begin to do what is  necessary to put a stop to the plague of pregnancies outside of marriage in  their communities. As Conot rightly warns, only if these pregnancies are  prevented can added expenditures for the education of black children have their  intended effect.  </P> <P> PATRICK GROFF  </P> <P> Professor, School of Education  </P> <P> San Diego State University  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 19, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROP. 103 SUPPORTERS ASK LIMITS BE SET ON AUTO POLICY CANCELING  </P> <P> The Proposition 103 "Voter Revolt" organization and a coalition of consumer and  civil rights groups filed an administrative petition with the state Department  of Insurance on Wednesday proposing a specific set of regulations to limit  insurance company rights to cancel or refuse to renew auto insurance policies.  </P> <P> The petitioners complained that Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie has  "failed to act decisively" to promulgate rules fleshing out and applying the  portions of Proposition 103 that the state Supreme Court ruled on Dec. 7 could  go into effect pending the court's review of the measure's constitutionality.  </P> <P> Among the groups filing the petition were the Consumers Union, the Center for  Public Interest Law, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, the National  Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People, the South-Central Organizing  Committee, the Latino Issues Forum and the Congress of California Seniors.  </P> <P> Under the petition procedure, the department has 30 days to either accept the  regulations the groups propose, deny them or call a public hearing on the  matter.  </P> <P> The petition was filed at the Insurance Department offices in Los Angeles. In  San Francisco, a spokeswoman for Gillespie said the commissioner had not yet  seen it and would reserve comment.  </P> <P> However, Gillespie, under pressure from a large association of insurance agents  to issue regulations on how to apply portions of Proposition 103, said earlier  this month that she would not do so until the Supreme Court rules on the  measure.  </P> <P> The proposed regulations on cancellations and non-renewals filed by the  pro-Proposition 103 groups Wednesday follow the filing of another petition last  week by many of the same groups. That petition proposed procedures for  exempting companies from the rate rollbacks called for by Proposition 103, if  the Supreme Court upholds the rollbacks.  </P> <P> Under the measure, a company may be exempted from the prescribed 20% rollbacks  from 1987 levels if it can show the insurance commissioner that it would face a  substantial threat of insolvency if it made such cuts.  </P> <P> The pro-Proposition 103 groups are proposing that "urgency status" be given  company petitions for exemptions, that hearings to be conducted by an  administrative law judge be scheduled within 14 days and that the insurance  commissioner make a determination within three days of receiving a proposed  decision from the judge.  </P> <P> A key recommendation by the pro-103 groups involves standards for determining  when there is "a substantial increase in the hazard insured against" that,  under Proposition 103, would allow the companies to refuse to renew a policy.  </P> <P> The pro-103 groups advanced a regulation saying that such an increase in hazard  exists for any person whose driving record shows a violation count, according  to the state Department of Motor Vehicles, of more than three points within 24  months, more than four points within 36 months or more than five points within  60 months. Most speeding convictions count for a point, while negligent or  drunk-driving convictions count for two points.  </P> <P> In addition, there would be a recognized substantial increase in hazard if a  driver was involved in three or more accidents resulting either in injury or  property damage of $200 or more within a five-year period.  </P> <P> In another development Wednesday, the Insurance Department officially barred  the Fireman's Fund group of companies from conditionally renewing auto  insurance policies, a practice the companies implemented after Proposition 103  passed. The seven Fireman's Fund companies have been telling customers their  policies will not be renewed unless they agree to give the companies the right  to later cancel coverage.  </P></p>

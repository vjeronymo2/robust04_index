			<p><P> November 1, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TONIGHT'S PREP FOOTBALL;  </P> <P> GROUNDED GARCIA HAS EL MODENA CLOSE TO TITLE  </P> <P> Adam Garcia's first game of the 1990 football season was interrupted by a loud  noise -- the one his right shoulder made when he reached up to bat down a pass.  </P> <P> The El Modena High School senior was playing defensive back when he separated  his shoulder in the fourth quarter of a 17-7 loss to Edison.  </P> <P> "I went up to hit ball down, and all I heard was this 'pop'," said Garcia, 5  feet 10 and 165 pounds. "When I landed on the field I was out cold (having  passed out from the pain). They (trainers) popped my shoulder back in on the  field.  </P> <P> "But when I got to the sideline, the team doctor moved my shoulder around to  check my mobility, and it popped out again. We had to pop it back in place. It  was just like Mel Gibson did with his shoulder in 'Lethal Weapon 2.' "  </P> <P> Fortunately for Garcia, he suffered no long-term damage and missed only two  games. But the injury ended his days as a defensive back -- and quarterback.  </P> <P> "I went back to practice, and there was no way I could throw ball," he said. "I  couldn't get my arm up high enough."  </P> <P> That was a problem for Vanguard Coach Bill Backstrom.  </P> <P> Jose Prado has taken over as the team's quarterback. But what was Backstrom  going to do with Garcia, one of his best athletes?  </P> <P> Move him to tailback, of course.  </P> <P> The change has worked out well. In five games as a tailback, Garcia has 519  yards rushing, including 167 and three touchdowns in a 21-7 victory over Santa  Ana Valley last week.  </P> <P> El Modena (5-3, 3-0) is hoping for another big game from Garcia tonight when it  plays Foothill (2-6, 1-2) at El Modena. The Vanguards can clinch the Century  League title with a victory.  </P> <P> The Vanguards slipped to 1-2 before Garcia returned from his injury, and lost  in his first game back, but they have won the past four games. They've averaged  25 points a game during their streak, and the threat of Garcia as a rusher has  opened up Prado's passing game.  </P> <P> "We hope it keeps the defenses honest," Garcia said of the game plan. "There's  no way they can key on just one person.  </P> <P> "We finally put it all together and play as a team. The offensive line is the  key to the whole thing."  </P> <P> Bishop Amat vs. Mater Dei at Santa Ana Stadium -- Who will be dancing in  celebration after this Angelus League matchup? Bishop Amat has some of the  league's quickest players, but Mater Dei might have the quickest in running  back Derek Sparks.  </P> <P> Bishop Amat (6-1, 2-0) is coming off a 49-13 victory over Servite. Mater Dei  (4-4, 2-0) lost to Paramount, 28-11, in a nonleague game.  </P> <P> In other games tonight:  </P> <P> Empire League: Katella vs. El Dorado at Valencia High School, Los Alamitos vs.  Loara at Glover Stadium; Garden Grove League: Garden Grove vs. Rancho Alamitos  at Bolsa Grande High School; Orange League: Savanna at Western; Pacific Coast  League: Laguna Beach vs. Laguna Hills at Mission Viejo High School; Sea View  League: Woodbridge at Newport Harbor; Sunset League: Edison vs. Ocean View at  Huntington Beach High School.  </P></p>

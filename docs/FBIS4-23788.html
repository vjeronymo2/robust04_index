			<p>BFN     [Text] Bujumbura, June 15 (AFP) -- Fears that ethnic  fighting in Rwanda is spreading to neighbouring Burundi  increased Wednesday [15 June] as aid officials questioned who  was to blame for a massacre of 100 refugees in the north of the  country.    The massacre Monday in Bugabira, in the northern province of  Kirundo, was initially reported to have been carried out by  Rwandan Hutu militants on Tutsi refugees.    But UN High Commissioner for Refugees [UNHCR] envoy here  Shelly Peterman said there were signs that the victims of the  slaughter were Hutus. Other aid officials allege the killings  were carried out by members of the Tutsi-led Burundi army.    Peterman said UNHCR staff had attended the arrival at  Bugabira of some 500 Rwandan refugees fleeing their own country.  The following day the staff returned to find 100 of them dead,  he said.    He declined to speculate who was responsible, saying that  was  for the official investigation to determine.    Military authorities meanwhile reported clashes between  armed  gangs at Kayanza in northern Burundi, with about 20 people dead  in the last few days. Some observers dispute the figure, saying  the toll was higher.    Clashes were also reported in the hills to the east of  Bujumbura, where armed forces are fighting Hutu extremists  chased out of the suburb of Kamenge about two months ago.</p>

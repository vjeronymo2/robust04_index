			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of Venture and Development Capital (1): A rethink on performance measures - Poor returns are prompting radical reforms in the venture capital industry, reports Charles Batchelor. The accepted practices by which the industry has lived for the past decade are now being challenged by its increasingly critical investors SMALLER companies that receive backing from venture and development capitalists seem to be emerging from the recession more rapidly than their larger counterparts. Stock market interest in venture backed companies is stronger now than for many years and in recent months a succession of venture funded firms has obtained a listing. Significant deal flow - attractive propositions worth backing - is yet to appear in this initial stage of recovery, but all the indicators point to an upturn in worthwhile investments. Behind the scenes, however, the venture and development capital industry is undergoing an intensive overhaul. The practices and assumptions by which the industry has lived for the past 10 years are being challenged by its increasingly critical investors. The changes currently under way include: A search for a more rigorous set of valuation guidelines to meet investor concern at the leeway venture funds have to fudge performance. Work on performance measures which will allow investors to compare the results of the funds in which they are invested and to monitor the performance of their own in-house managers. A radical rethink of the methods by which venture managers raise money from investors. Institutions are increasingly unwilling to tie their money to the traditional 10-year venture partnerships. A desperate search for funds by venture capitalists is prompting some innovative new financing structures. Hectic activity in a fast developing secondary market for venture portfolios. This is driven by disillusioned investors seeking to rid themselves of unwanted portfolios and by the need for venture capitalists to increase the sums under management and hence their management fees. If managers are unable to raise new money for their funds they will settle for recycling existing portfolios. Some of these issues have already been faced in the more developed US venture capital market, but they have yet to impact strongly on the venture market in continental Europe. For the moment it is the UK which is leading the way for venture capital throughout the continent. The British Venture Capital Association (BVCA) drew its first set of valuation guidelines in 1991 to help investors assess the worth of their portfolios. The guidelines were a valuable first step for assessing portfolio worth, but they still left too much room for subjectivity, says Mr Iain Tulloch, a director of Murray Johnstone and head of the BVCA's valuation committee. A revised set of guidelines is expected to be published in October. The new guide imposes stricter rules for writing down investments and requires more information for investors. Previously venture capitalists made a provision for 'permanent' diminution of value, allowing the unscrupulous to argue that a single poor set of results was not necessarily permanent. Provisions must now be made whether or not the fall in value is permanent. The next step for the venture capital industry is to use these more uniform guidelines to draw a set of performance measures enabling investors to compare different venture funds. Reference to the thousands of investments made since 1980 is required to devise any meaningful performance measures. The BVCA hopes to publish initial performance data next year. Performance indicators, when made readily available, will also enable the venture capitalist to attract investors to sound funds. However, in making fund performance more transparent the less successful funds will likely not succeed. Dissatisfaction with the fund performance has contributed to the sharp drop in new money for the industry. Independent UK venture funds, which account for about 45 per cent of all activity but act as a bellwether for the industry, raised just Pounds 300m in 1992, the third year of decline, according to BVCA figures. The investment picture was more positive with UK funds investing Pounds 1.4bn, a 15 per cent rise on the year before. The BVCA remains concerned, however, that the industry may have used up its funds 'pool' by the end of the 1990s. For Europe as a whole, the stronger performance of some continental economies in 1992 led to small increases in funds raised and amounts invested. New fundraising increased by 0.6 per cent to Ecu4.2bn (Pounds 3.21bn) while investments rose 1.5 per cent to Ecu4.7bn, according to the European Venture Capital Association. The UK and European industry remained focused on later stage investments - development capital, buy-outs and buy-ins - while start-ups and early stage details continued in the minority. Poor fund performance, leading to a more critical investor less inclined to invest new money has forced the industry to become more inventive in its fundraising activity and move away from the typical 10-year limited partnership. Baronsmead, a medium-sized independent fund has attempted to lure investors with a promise to return committed funds at any time if requested and to give investors a say in the choice of companies backed. Legal &amp; General Ventures, part of Legal &amp; General life assurance group, has unveiled plans for a series of rolling one-year funds which would return uninvested cash at the year end. Mrs Carol Ames, in charge of unquoted investments for Eagle Star Investment Managers, says: 'Arrangements between investors and venture capitalists will be made on more of an individual basis in future.' Venture capitalists have become aware that in introducing new measures to boost funds, the investor's approach to investments is becoming more short term - leading to demands for impossibly early returns. Mr Jonny Maxwell, manager of unquoted investments at Standard Life Assurance, says the growing second hand portfolio and partnership market is changing the shape of the industry. 'Cannibalism is well under way. Almost all the serious players are asking if any portfolios are available. They are looking to poach contracts from other managers,' he says. Venture capitalists are even willing to accept lower management fees or a smaller share in the capital gain to win a portfolio. One venture firm, Foreign &amp; Colonial Ventures, specialises in acquiring unwanted portfolios and selling off investments. It is currently winding down two portfolios. 'We don't have to apologise for the mistakes that have been made,' says Mr James Nelson, managing director. 'If the original manager has paid Pounds 10m for an investment now worth only Pounds 3m he will be reluctant to sell. We do not have that problem.' Winding down portfolios early is encouraged by the reduction in profits over time. Change in the venture capital industry has been driven by investors' dissatisfaction with fund performance and a growing awareness that they deserve a better deal. The fundamental reforms now taking place should lead to a more responsive and cost-effective industry by the late 1990s. But change will not take place without casualties. Fund managers who can adapt quickly might survive - for some it may already be too late.</p>

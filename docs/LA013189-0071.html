			<p><P> January 31, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEUKMEJIAN'S HOUSING CUTBACKS ASSAILED;  </P> <P> ADVOCATES SAY BUDGET PLAN WOULD CRIPPLE RUNNING OF SHELTERS  </P> <P> Los Angeles officials and homeless advocates are mounting an intense lobbying  effort to head off Gov. George Deukmejian's proposal to eliminate funding for  the California Housing Trust Fund, which they say would cripple the day-to-day  running of shelters for the homeless and "shared housing" programs for the  elderly.  </P> <P> The trust fund has provided $2 million to $10 million statewide annually to pay  counselors' salaries, utility bills and other daily costs at facilities ranging  from the huge Weingart Center on Skid Row to tiny neighborhood programs. Under  Deukmejian's budget, proposed earlier this month, the fund would get no money.  </P> <P> "Where and how does the governor think we'll be taking care of these people --  in prisons?" asked Maxene Johnston, executive director of the Weingart Center.  "This (homeless) problem -- I don't think he gets it, and I don't think his  advisers get it. We're looking around for other sources of money and we are  anticipating a crisis."  </P> <P> "Why is he doing this?" asked Janet Witkin, director of Alternative Living for  the Aging, which matches low-income elderly people with roommates to split the  cost of skyrocketing local rents.  </P> <P> "We have visitors from Europe coming here all the time to check out this great  program, to copy it, and now the governor's going to cut our key funding,"  Witkin said.  </P> <P> Julie Stewart, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Housing and Community  Development, said the money has been cut from the budget because California's  revenues from tideland oil extraction have dwindled. The revenues, used to  finance everything from education programs to the trust fund, "went into  education and other programs when the priorities were decided this time," she  said.  </P> <P> Stewart said her department is not trying to find another source of money to  keep the programs afloat.  </P> <P> Marc Brown, of the California Rural Legal Assistance Foundation, said his group  is "pushing hard" to have the cuts restored when legislative committees review  the budget this spring.  </P> <P> Brown said Deukmejian's cuts "would be a real tragedy for California." They  include the Farmworker Housing Grant Fund -- money earmarked for improving  slumlike farm worker housing.  </P> <P> Gary Squier, Mayor Tom Bradley's housing coordinator, said scores of  grass-roots programs and shelters are threatened.  </P> <P> "God, I'll tell you, these small shelter operations are all over the place --  just chewing-gum operations -- and if Deukmejian could only see how great the  problem is and how we are trying to deal with it, he would be a lot more  understanding," Squier said.  </P> <P> Administration officials have argued that the cuts will be offset by  Propositions 77 and 84, approved by voters last November, which provide $425  million for shelters and low-cost housing.  </P> <P> However, bond money cannot be used for daily costs, only for construction and  rehabilitation of buildings. "They give us the bricks and mortar, but there's a  desperate need for human services," said Ruth Schwartz, director of the Shelter  Partnership in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Johnston, of the Weingart Center, said that of the 6,000 people who have sought  help there, "62% did not return to the street because of the extra care and  attention we gave them. Without the programs, they will go back on the  streets." The center's counseling and job referral programs receive  three-quarters of their money from the trust fund.  </P> <P> City officials and advocates for the homeless have increasingly criticized  Deukmejian's resistance to housing programs -- especially his dozens of vetoes  of major housing bills over the years.  </P> <P> California has the largest homeless population in the nation and the worst  rental housing affordability problem, with 790,000 families living in housing  beyond their means, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities in  Washington. But it ranks near the bottom of the industrial states in funding  housing programs.  </P></p>

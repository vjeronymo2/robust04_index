			<p><P> June 24, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE CONTROVERSY OVER CONTROVERSIAL ART  </P> <P> Parachini's article gives the National Endowment for the Arts an image of  chronic spinelessness.  </P> <P> Censorphobia is no excuse for abandoning common sense and good taste in making  artistic judgments. Whoever could say with a straight face that Andres  Serrano's image of Christ in urine is art must be a direct descendant of the  emperor who gave gold to the weaver to make his wonderful invisible clothes.  </P> <P> Some people must be laughing privately at how they are fooling the dilettantes  who have drifted into positions of authority in the art establishment.  </P> <P> No amount of intimidation justifies any endowment organization's letting itself  be bamboozled into supporting vulgarity for its own sake.  </P> <P> EV MORRIS  </P> <P> Hemet  </P></p>

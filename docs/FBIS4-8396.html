			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Sarajevo, April 12 (AFP) -- Serbs placed at  least 40 UN military observers under house arrest on Tuesday [12  April], a UN official said here, as retaliation for air strikes  against Serb troops around the besieged Moslem enclave of  Gorazde.    Major Rob Thomas, Canadian head of UN military observers,  said house arrests took place in Serb-controlled zones in Bosnia.    Police and Serb soldiers stood guard outside some of the  observers' homes, Thomas said, while other observers had been  threatened with arrest if they left their places of residence.    The house arrests were one of the responses by Bosnian Serb  forces to NATO airstrikes Sunday and Monday on Serb positions  around Gorazde in eastern Bosnia.    Another UN military observer and his interpreter were  missing  on Monday in Serb territory after they left Zepa, a Moslem  enclave north of Gorazde.    Elsewhere, General Michael Rose, UN Protection Force  (UNPROFOR) commander in Bosnia, said Tuesday he was "worried"  about peacekeeping forces trapped by Serb mines in several areas  of Bosnia.    Talks were continuing Tuesday to free a convoy of Swedish  peacekeeping troops blocked since Sunday at a Serb checkpoint in  Kobiljaca, northwest of Sarajevo, French journalists said.    Serb troops planted mines around the convoy of six vehicles  and 16 men after the first NATO airstrike on Sunday. The  original reason for the blockade was said to be "administrative."    More peacekeeping troops were also trapped and surrounded by  mines in at least three Serb heavy arms centres in the exclusion  zone around Sarajevo, a UNPROFOR spokesman said.    Rose told reporters at a press conference: "They (the  troops)  are not under any direct threat at the moment." He said he was  "worried" by the situtation but did not want to increase  tension.

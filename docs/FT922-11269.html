			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / Letter: Financial necessities Sir, Companies' annual reports are a vital means of communication. It is encouraging that some attempt has been made to measure their effectiveness ('Annual reports marked 'could do better'', April 23). This can even be developed into an entertaining parlour game. But am I alone in my concern at the implication that financial analysts need spend no more than 100 seconds, and preferably less, on extracting five key items of financial information - and the related inference that five such items are all that they need?

			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / Municipal Mutual in talks with rivals after big losses: Company's solvency margin has fallen below 30% level MUNICIPAL MUTUAL, the UK's ninth largest general insurer, was yesterday in talks about its future with two other insurers. Municipal, which is owned by its policyholders and insures nine out of 10 local authorities in the UK, is talking to one UK and one continental European insurer about a possible transfer of its general business, which generated net premium income of Pounds 572.3m in 1990. Chairman, Mr Maurice Stonefrost, admitted the company, formed in 1903, might well disappear as an independent entity. Any deal would represent the most important restructuring in the British general insurance market since the takeover of Cornhill by Germany's Allianz in 1986. The talks began this week and are at an early stage. They follow heavy trading losses in the past two years which have cut Municipal's solvency margin - the yardstick measuring net assets as a percentage of non-life premium income - below the 30 per cent level regarded by industry regulators as adequate. Mr Stonefrost yesterday insist-ed Municipal was solvent but said the company had been in contact with the Department of Trade and Industry because of concerns about its solvency margin. Like other insurers, Municipal has been hard hit by rising claims and intense price competition in the UK market. Underwriting losses rose to Pounds 140.4m in 1990 and 1991 was at least as bad, although final figures are not yet available. The company has been hit by rising claims on employers' and public liability policies and could have insufficient reserves to meet future claims on these policies, which often emerge many years after the policy is written. Mr Stonefrost said that during 1990 and 1991 'claims experience was of a scale and nature much greater than had been anticipated or provided for'. The group has been badly hit by rising arson claims by schools - most of them the result of fires started by children. The company has been especially hard hit by price competition as it moved aggressively to reduce its dependence on its traditional local authority business. In 1990, it won a contract to write household insurance for Cheltenham and Gloucester Building Society on the basis of substantially lower premiums than its rivals. Gross premium income at Municipal and its operating subsidiary Municipal General rose from Pounds 425m in 1986 to Pounds 794m in 1990. The company also reduced its reliance on reinsurance, retaining more risks on its own books. Municipal has already stopped some business because of concerns about solvency. Last month, it sold its Australian subsidiary and transferred its commercial lines account to Groupe des Assurances Nationales - the French insurer which plans to build a larger presence in the UK market.</p>

			<p><P> September 19, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BITTER ISSUE OF WRITERS GUILD ELECTION IS STRIKE OF '88  </P> <P> The grueling Hollywood writers' strike that virtually shut down TV and film  production ended more than a year ago. But this month's campaign for the top  posts at the Writers Guild of America, West is reviving the painful memories  and internal dissent prompted by that five-month walkout, the longest in movie  history.  </P> <P> Winners in the current voting -- which ends Thursday -- will help chart the  course for the guild's next round of negotiations with management in 1992.  Those contract talks aren't expected to be any easier than previous  negotiations in the 1980s, when increasingly intransigent producers sought and  won rollbacks from Hollywood's creative unions.  </P> <P> While Writers Guild elections typically are more spirited than other union  contests in Hollywood, this year's race is especially rough. "It's pretty  nasty," said incumbent president George Kirgo. Added one of his two opponents,  Burt Prelutsky: "There seems to be hard feelings this time, a lot more dirty  politics."  </P> <P> Many of those hard feelings are a direct outgrowth of the strike. Prelutsky and  his allies wanted the guild leadership to be tougher with management -- even if  it meant a longer strike -- while presidential candidate L. Travis Clark was  part of a coalition of dissident writers who threatened to cross picket lines  to go back to work.  </P> <P> Kirgo falls squarely in the middle, defending his own performance as president  during the strike, and that of executive director Brian Walton, the London-born  lawyer who was hired to run the guild four years ago.  </P> <P> Many in the guild view the election as a referendum on Walton, who was thrown  into the limelight as the union's chief negotiator during the strike. Kirgo  lists the future of Walton as one of the two most important issues facing the  guild, right alongside the union's need to cope with the increasing  globalization of film and TV production.  </P> <P> "(Walton) is one of the most brilliant people I've ever met," said Kirgo. "For  us to lose him would be a tragedy." Kirgo's allies hint strongly that Walton  would leave if Prelutsky -- considered the most serious challenger to the  incumbent -- won the election.  </P> <P> Walton will say only that his contract runs through 1992, and he has "no plans  to leave the guild earlier than that."  </P> <P> Walton received a standing ovation when guild members met to ratify the strike  settlement in August, 1988, but Kirgo's two opponents for president don't think  he deserved it.  </P> <P> "Somehow, (Walton) wound up being the hero," said Prelutsky, who has won awards  for his TV movies and has written for such shows as "MASH," "Newhart" and  "Family Ties." "But I don't think the strike was successful."  </P> <P> As a member of the guild's board, Prelutsky cast what he calls a "symbolic"  vote against the final strike settlement, and he continues to believe that the  guild should have extracted more gains from management.  </P> <P> Prelutsky has been critical of Walton and Kirgo for other reasons too. "Brian  is sucking up too much power and George has been an accessory to that," said  Prelutsky. During the strike, he insisted, "the board of directors was cut out  of the loop."  </P> <P> Walton disputes Prelutsky's claims, noting that board meetings during the  strike averaged one per week and totaled more than 80 hours. "In addition,  several board members were on the negotiating committee and the president  (Kirgo) was at almost all the negotiations," he said. From the opposite end of  the spectrum, Clark also chastises the guild's handling of the strike. A critic  of contemporary union leadership in general, Clark said the guild's leaders  should have tried harder to avert a strike by reaching an early accommodation  with management. "The leaders were saying, 'We're going to bring this town to  its knees.' But this is our community, our town," Clark said. "Negotiations  should not start 30 days before a contract ends. (Guild leaders) should be  keeping up contact with management. A strike should be a last resort."  </P> <P> Clark also contends that neither Kirgo nor Walton has been accessible to the  guild's membership during or since the strike. "My argument is not with  management right now," Clark said, "it's with an elitist leadership that  doesn't give its members access."  </P> <P> Walton calls the charges of elitism "ludicrous." He said that between 1985,  when he came to the guild, and 1988, he "personally met with 2,000 or more  writers in small groups. . . . I came to the guild deeply concerned about  making it a member-oriented service organization, and a very democratic one."  </P> <P> Kirgo dismisses the accusation that he and Walton were inaccessible during the  strike as "a joke. . . . I was on the phone day and night. I was never absent  from a picket." As for Prelutsky's criticism of the settlement, Kirgo notes  that in the final settlement, the union chocked up 33 gains over management's  first offer.  </P> <P> Though critical of Prelutsky, Kirgo saves his sharpest attack for Clark, saying  his election would be a "travesty." "He's been a member of the guild for two  years and he thinks he's ready to be president," Kirgo said.  </P> <P> Both Kirgo and Prelutsky attack Clark for his involvement last year with 21  dissident writers who not only threatened to cross picket lines, but also asked  the National Labor Relations Board to invalidate provisions of the union  constitution preventing members from resigning and going back to work.  </P> <P> "If he won, would he then quit the guild?" asked Prelutsky.  </P> <P> "We never said we would resign," Clark responded. "We said that anyone who did  want to (resign during a strike) should have the right to do so." The labor  board later sided with the 21 dissidents.  </P> <P> It is unclear how much support Clark, a former civil rights activist who  co-created the TV show "Tour of Duty," can draw. Although the 21 dissidents  attracted about 550 interested writers to an informational meeting last summer,  many writers are still bitter about the group's threatened secession in the  midst of a difficult strike.  </P> <P> Clark has engaged in some mudslinging of his own. In a Sept. 5 letter, Clark,  who is black, virtually accused the guild of racism when he claimed that a  non-candidate opponent had gained privileged access to his candidate's  statement. "I look forward to being reassured that my candidacy has not been  trivialized in the manner to which African-American candidates have been  accustomed in so many elections in this country," Clark wrote to the guild.  </P> <P> (The non-candidate opponent, Brad Radnitz, had referred to Clark's statement in  a written critique of Clark and others. But guild spokeswoman Cheryl Rhoden  said the candidate statements were made available to all guild members once  they were submitted.)  </P> <P> Even the secretary-treasurer race is not immune to these rough-and-tumble  politics. Two allies of candidate Adam Rodman purchased an advertisement in  Daily Variety contending that the election of one of his opponents, Oliver  Crawford, "would be highly detrimental to the best interests of the guild."  </P> <P> In an interview, Rodman said the advertisement was necessary because Crawford,  a 25-year board member and a Prelutsky ally, is well-known among guild members.  "Ollie is just unqualified," said Rodman, a Kirgo ally. "Everyone knows his  name and they may associate that with competence."  </P> <P> "I try to stay away from these scurrilous attacks," Crawford responded. "I  don't think they belong in this organization."  </P> <P> The third candidate for secretary-treasurer, David P. Lewis, has managed to  stay out of this particular fray.  </P> <P> Despite the high emotions in this campaign, the election results will probably  turn on a fraction of the guild's membership. According to Rhoden, no more than  1,600 of the guild's nearly 6,500 eligible members ever vote in officer  elections.  </P> <P> The Writers Guild, insists Kirgo, came out of the strike with a reputation for  strength and unity. The current campaign is "embarrassing," he said. "I'm just  embarrassed by all this."  </P></p>

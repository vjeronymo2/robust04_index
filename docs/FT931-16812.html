			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / Hamas fails in bid to get PLO to pull out of peace talks The Islamic resistance movement Hamas failed to persuade the Palestine Liberation Organisation to pull Palestinian delegates out of Middle East peace talks at a meeting in Khartoum yesterday, Reuter reports from Amman. However, a Hamas official said it and the PLO's mainstream Fatah movement agreed after three days of talks that dialogue would continue. After Israel expelled 415 Palestinians on December 17, Hamas and other radical groups tried unsuccessfully at a PLO leadership meeting in Tunis to press for the withdrawal of Palestinian delegates from the peace negotiations.</p>

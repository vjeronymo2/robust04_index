			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Need to achieve a better balance in social policy in Europe and the UK (2) Sir, Peter Cooke's thoughtful letter was published in the same issue in which you featured a report, entitled 'Germany 'ahead of UK on labour costs' ', detailing the Confederation of British Industry's concerns that Germany's unit labour costs are reducing at the same time as the UK's are again beginning to increase. It would seem that the current policy of resisting the legal protection of employee rights is no guarantee of maintaining comparatively low unit labour costs, even when the comparison is with Germany, the European country where those rights are most entrenched.

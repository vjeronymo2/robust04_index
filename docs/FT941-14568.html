			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / World Trade News: EU leaves banana offer on the table The European Commission said yesterday that its offer of greater access to the banana market in the European Union for Latin American producers remained on the table until February 15 in spite of a damning report by a Gatt panel. The Commission was divided on the issue with Mr Rene Steichen, agriculture commissioner, pushing to keep the offer open while Sir Leon Brittan, trade commissioner, wanted to withdraw. Keeping the offer open would contradict earlier threats made in a letter from Mr Steichen and Sir Leon that the offer would be withdrawn if Latin American producers continued with their Gatt complaint. Some European countries appeared unhappy with the Commission's apparent about-turn. In addition, Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, is reported to be protesting to the Commission over strong-arm tactics used in encouraging Latin American producers to agree to the new banana deal. Latin American countries finally decided late on Tuesday to reject the EU's offer of greater access to the banana market after support from Costa Rica crumbled. The latest offer by the EU to eight Latin American producers would allow them to export 2.1m tonnes of bananas to the EU this year as opposed to 2m tonnes last year. It would also increase quota allocations for the Latin Americans, chiefly benefiting Costa Rica which would see its share of the 2.1m tonne access rise to 23.4 per cent from 19 per cent in 1992. A group of five Latin American countries have complained to Gatt about the EU's banana regime which favours African, Caribbean and Pacific producers. A first panel report by Gatt was released to complainants on Tuesday. The report found that the EU's banana arrangements are inconsistent with Gatt rules: in particular the 20 per cent tariffs charged, discrimination between producers such as those from Latin American countries and ACP countries and the licensing regime. The report is unlikely to be adopted but it puts EU countries in a difficult position. Some member states are pressing for changes to the banana regime.</p>

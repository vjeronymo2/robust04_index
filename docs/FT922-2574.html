			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / OFT probes Wimbledon ticket sales THE OFFICE of Fair Trading confirmed yesterday that it was investigating a complaint about the sale of tickets for the Wimbledon tennis championships. Mr Mike Burton, a former England rugby player who runs a corporate hospitality company, complained to the European Commission that the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club was operating a cartel and artificially forcing up the prices of debenture tickets for the Wimbledon finals, while banning the resale of other tickets. Debenture holders are guaranteed the most sought-after tickets, those for the men's singles final in the centre court. The tickets have a face value of Pounds 46, but Mr Burton claims that the All England Club has bought tickets for up to Pounds 700 and resold them to corporate hospitality companies for as much as Pounds 890. The club introduced anti-touting measures - including banning resale or transfer of ordinary tickets - for last year's season. Mr Burton subsequently issued a writ against the club for allegedly breaching competition law, but later withdrew his application for an injunction. The OFT said it had been passed a copy of the complaint to the European Commission and would make inquiries. The All England Club yesterday made no comment on Mr Burton's allegations.</p>

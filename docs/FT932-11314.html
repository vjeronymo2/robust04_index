			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Council members for Euro committee MR Tristan Garel-Jones, foreign office minister, confirmed last night that as a results of its earlier defeat on the Maastricht bill the government would appoint members of local councils to all 24 places allocated to Britain on the European Community's committee of the regions, Ivor Owen writes. As the report stage of the measure got under way, the government's acceptance that it could not revive its original proposal that businesspeople should be included among the British representatives on the committee was hailed as 'surrender' by Mr George Robertson from the Labour front bench. He stressed that during the committee stage the government had been defeated on a Labour amendment requiring all the British members of the committee to be elected concillors in spite of having entered into a 'conspiracy' with Scottish and Welsh nationalist MPs. Mr Robertson's claim that the nationalist parties had got nothing out of their deal with the government was disputed by Mr Ieuan Wyn Jones (Plaid Cymru Yns Mond) and Mrs Margaret Ewing (SNP Moray). In a series of clashes, Mr Jones emphasised that although claiming to support the Maastricht treaty Mr Robertson and his colleagues had voted 38 times with the Tory rebels who wanted to wreck it. MR Garel-Jones said the government would consult all the political parties before deciding on the composition of the British contingent on the committee of the regions.</p>

			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Restaurants: Lunch for a fiver - at Britain's finest - Nicholas Lander outlines the Weekend FT's scheme for eating out at an affordable price THE IDEA for the FT's 'Lunch for a Fiver' offer was conceived in New York last summer, when restaurants were emptying as locals headed for the beach. Delegates to the 1992 Democratic Convention failed to book the empty tables, so 100 restaurateurs agreed to try the ancient remedy of cutting prices. Each offered a set three-course lunch menu for Dollars 19.92 (then just over Pounds 10). The scheme was a success. After I had written about it, my editor, a Yorkshireman with a keen eye for value, asked whether we could run a similar scheme in the UK. I suggested we should try in late January, traditionally a quiet period for the trade. We decided on the ambitious target of Pounds 5 for a two course lunch and that the FT menu should be offered for two weeks to any customer and without special conditions. We then approached a selected list of restaurants, suggesting that they should enter into the spirit of the scheme by showing what they could do for Pounds 5. Most agreed to join. It will run for ten week-day lunches from Monday, January 18 until Friday, January 29. A full list of the 130 restaurants taking part appears in the box on the righthand side of this page. From Monday, January 11, the FT will be printing the names of a proportion of the participating restaurants each day as well as running a competition based on the names of the restaurants listed. (Please note that some of the restaurants close on a Monday). The prize for the winner of this competition - and for that in a questionnaire accompanying complimentary copies of the FT available at these restaurants, will be a weekend for two at Gidleigh Park, Devon, a luxurious country house hotel on the edge of Dartmoor renowned for its food and wine. If you would like to try the FT's 'Lunch for a Fiver', all you have to do is to specify the FT menu when booking a table. Customers will not be under any obligation to choose that menu once they arrive. The Pounds 5 will cover two courses from the special menu - either a starter and main or main course and dessert. Value added tax is included in the fixed price, but coffee, service, drinks, wine or a third course are not. Restaurateurs are interpreting this in different ways. Some are including a third course for the price of two; some are specifying the price of a third course; while others are taking the price of any extra dishes from their a la carte menu. Some are just discounting the price of any two dishes from their menu to meet the Pounds 5 limit. We have asked all the restaurants to submit sample menus. It would be naive for any prospective diner to expect to be offered the most expensive raw ingredients - fillet steak, sea bass or black truffles - for Pounds 5. But the range of dishes on offer is impressive. Starters include pumpkin risotto, fish soup and omelette Arnold Bennett while main courses include breast of guinea fowl with braised leeks, salmis of venison, and salmon and haddock fish cakes with parsley sauce. Although the timing of this scheme is important, one other vital factor that makes it possible is the growing appreciation of relatively inexpensive ingredients. Pasta, polenta, interesting and well-prepared vegetables, cheaper cuts of meat and less well-known varieties of fish provide, in the hands of an imaginative chef, the basis for exciting food. And, above all, we all hope that the FT's 'Lunch for a Fiver' will provide enjoyment. One restaurateur said that he was taking part not so much for the extra business but for the fun. 'I have been a restaurateur for 18 years and I am beginning to feel that the fun is going out of my profession,' he said. If this scheme is successful, it may be possible to repeat it. The most productive long-term effects will come from those who try the menus on offer and pass on their comments, complimentary or critical, to the restaurants and to me, Nicholas Lander, at the FT.</p>

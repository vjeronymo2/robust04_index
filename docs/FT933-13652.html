			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Records: Strange bedfellows - Opera Monk: Atlas. Meredith Monk Vocal Ensemble/Wayne Hankin. ECM 437 773-2 (two CDs) Maderna: Hyperion. Jacques Zoon, Penelope Walmsley-Clark, Bruno Ganz, Les Jeunes Solistes, ASKO Ensemble/Peter Eotvos. Disques Montaigne 782014 (two CDs) Dusapin: Medeamaterial. Hilde Leidland, Collegium Vocale, Orchestre de la Chapelle Royale/Philippe Herreweghe. Harmonia Mundi HMC 905215 ATLAS is the longest, most ambitious of Meredith Monk's performance pieces so far, categorised as 'an opera in three parts' but just as heavily dependent upon dance and gesture as on music and text. When it was first performed at the Houston Opera in February 1991 Max Loppert greeted Atlas here with great enthusiasm; when Monk toured an abridged concert version to London last year it made a charming if slighter impression. Certainly in concert and even more in a recording the dramatic essence of Atlas, the distinctive flavour of its visual and musical synthesis, are significantly diminished. The 15 numbers which make up the musical score do not carry the narrative forward so much as provide gloss and illustration. The majority of them are essentially textless, the dance and mime provide a kind of thread of continuity in the theatre, but to a large extent the audience has to take the story (an allegorical tale of a young girl travelling through life and through the world until she finds the spiritual peace she seeks) as given. On disc, then, each number has to survive on its own intrinsic musical merits; there can be no real sense of cumulative effect or of a dramatic context into which they can be fitted. The sequence of musical concepts has vivid and inspired moments as well as some that are insipid and inconsequential. At its best the music of Atlas is disarmingly likeable, constructed from the minimum of material - a simple melodic pattern, a handful of syllables, a second-hand folk tune  - and worked with great imagination and a minimum of rhetoric. The instrumental accompaniments are no more than functional, their scoring sometimes rather crude. It is the voices, wonderfully disciplined and precise, that matter, but their effect one must be incomparably enhanced when combined with congruent visuals and Monk's conception can be assimilated whole. Alongside Atlas, Maderna's Hyperion seems very much the product of a totally alien culture, almost a period piece. Slowly but surely Maderna's musical personality, which was very much shaded in his own lifetime by the greater flamboyance of his younger contemporaries Boulez and Stockhausen, seems to be acquiring a kind of icon-like stature, his achievement as a conductor recognised as hugely influential, his own music celebrated as one of the most lyrical products of the post-war avant garde. Certainly Hyperion is the quintessential 1960s piece, assembled over some six years from a variety of compositions that have independent lives of their own yet are linked more or less by their relationship to the poetry of Holderlin, and particularly to his Hyperion poems. The cycle contains orchestral pieces, a massive soprano aria, important solos for a flute and readings from Holderlin's verse; the ordering of these events is left to the performers. The Disques Montaigne recording, as well documented as always, is taken from performances staged at the Vienna Festwochen in 1992, a production shared with festivals in Amsterdam, Paris and Rome. The performing version was made by Peter Eotvos, and in musical terms at least it coheres wonderfully, full of marvellous orchestral writing  -Maderna was a master of texture and colour - intensely lyrical writing for both the flute (vividly played by Jacques Zoon) and the soprano (the indefatigable Penelope Walmsley-Clark), with Bruno Ganz relishing his delivery of the poetry. On disc, when the sequence of events can be tailored to the listener's own taste, it is endlessly diverting; on stage, one fancies, it would require a thoroughly imaginative staging to work effectively. When Dusapin's Medeamaterial was first performed at the Monnaie in Brussels in March 1992 it was hindered rather than helped by it as stage production, which blurred what was already a profoundly ambiguous scenario and text taken from Heiner Muller's playlet of the same name. On disc it begins to make more sense, and it is possible to appreciate far more the ingenuity of Dusapin's score, composed for a baroque orchestra playing in baroque temperament - the original commission specified that the work would be given in a double bill with Purcell's Dido and Aeneas. The burden of the work falls upon the character of Medea. gallantly taken by Heide Leidland; though the Nurse and her husband Jason are given a few phrases in the opening moments of the work, Medea taskes central stage for more than half an hour with a huge monologue, a grand apologia pro vita sua, while the orchestra busies itself with minute figuration and the occasional disconcerting baroque echo. The accompanying booklet provides texts in French and German, as well as an introduction translated from the French original; those who wish to get to grips with an intriguing work would be advised to read the French rather than the English version, which obscures far more than it manages to clarify.</p>

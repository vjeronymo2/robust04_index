			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / Determined Republicans halt progress on Clinton agenda As the day dawned yesterday, there were three Republican filibusters holding up bills in the Senate, and more threatened. By mid-morning the opposition had scored in the House, forcing a delay of at least 24 hours of a floor vote on the Gatt treaty. Across the legislative spectrum, measures that had once seemed certain of passage - often those which had already passed both chambers in different forms - were held in jeopardy by the Republican determination to block virtually every bill that could conceivably be interpreted as a success for President Bill Clinton and the Democratic party. The rules of Congress allow different methods of obstruction to be freely deployed. In the 100-member Senate, this may take the form of the simple filibuster, which normally requires 60 votes to override but under some circumstances two-thirds of those present. This hurdle has often been too high for the Democrats, who have a 56-44 nominal majority but face not only Republican solidarity but also defections from their own ranks. Senate rules also permit 30 hours for debate after a filibuster has been defeated. This has already been employed on both major and minor issues, such as nominations to federal office, thus squeezing the calendar even further before the scheduled adjournment at the end of this week. The Gatt delay in the House was also the result of a parliamentary device, with Republicans demanding that the rule under which the trade treaty would be debated be changed so as to allow further investigation of one provision. Specifically, Congressman Newt Gingrich, the Republican whip, is objecting to the so-called telecommunications 'pioneer preference' clause in the bill covering fees to be paid by licensees of advanced cellular phone technology. This is part of the revenue-raising exercise required to offset any losses from lower tariffs. Mr Gingrich, a clear leader of the conservative forces in Congress, has made much of the fact that the Washington Post Company, owner of the capital's liberal newspaper, is a large investor in this technology. A Post editorial yesterday flatly denied, however, that it was receiving favourable treatment. Mr Gingrich is also the architect of Senate obstruction of the lobbying reform bill, now also held hostage in spite of the fact that it first passed the chamber by a 95-4 vote. United We Stand, the political organisation set up by Mr Ross Perot, the 1992 independent presidential candidate, has also demanded that the bill be passed. Public disgust with Congress is such that failure to act may rebound on incumbents in the mid-term elections on November 8. But this suits the Republicans, since far more Democrats are up for re-election. Mr Gingrich's artful argument is that the bill would circumscribe the constitutional right to petition the government - especially by religious groups, the most vocal and conservative of which are, of course, staunchly Republican. The mood of Congress, matching that of the country, is now foul. Even one Republican, Senator John McCain of Arizona, observed: 'Most Americans want us to get out of town - they think we have already done enough harm.' One anonymous Democrat acidly said: 'There is nothing the Republicans want - except our jobs.'</p>

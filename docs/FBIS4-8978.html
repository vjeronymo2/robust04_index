			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Lech Falandysz, deputy chief of the </F> President's Office, by Agnieszka Kublik; place and date not  given: "New Political System Means New Elections"]    [Text] [Kublik] Rumor has it that you have not been  sleeping well since you have been trying to find an answer to  the question of how to dissolve parliament by lawful means. If  the president were to ask you now whether you managed to come up  with something, what would you tell him?    [Falandysz] I would tell him that for now, I know of no such  way. But if the coalition manages to change the political  system--that is, if it takes the right to influence the  government's composition away from the president--one should  consider whether the Small Constitution does not allow for a  dissolution of parliament. I think that the coalition, while  submitting a motion for an amendment to the Small Constitution,  considered the possibility of new parliamentary and presidential  elections.    [Kublik] Why would the coalition think that?    [Falandysz] I hope that serious politicians are aware that a  change in the political system should result in new elections.  I do not even rule out the possibility that the Sejm itself  will come to the conclusion that it has changed the political  system and then the Sejm will dissolve itself.    [Kublik] I hope you do not really mean that. After all,  your boss has announced that he is ready to take an extralegal  measure, even if he were to face the Tribunal of State for that.  The Small Constitution allows for the possibility of dissolving  the Sejm in three situations only: if the Sejm does not adopt a  budget in the prescribed time period, if it adopts a  no-confidence vote against the government while failing to  appoint a prime minister, or if the Sejm fails to nominate a new  government. None of the above situations apply to what we have  right now.    [Falandysz] One cannot rule out anything in politics.    [Kublik] Some people fear that the president, while ignoring  legal provisions, will write a "Consider yourself dismissed"  letter to the prime minister. This is how he recalled Henryk  Wujec in the past, from the post of secretary of the Citizens  Committee, and, most recently, this is how he recalled Marek  Markiewicz, chief of the National Radio and Television  Broadcasting Council.    [Falandysz] There is no analogy there, but I cannot rule out  such a situation. One would have to think more about it.    [Kublik] But what do you want to think about when the  Constitution does not provide that the president is empowered to  dismiss the prime minister?    [Falandysz] But one cannot exclude the possibility that, if  the president withdraws his support for the prime minister, the  latter would offer his resignation and then one would have to  begin appointing a new government.    [Kublik] Why would the prime minister want to resign? After  all, he enjoys support in the Sejm of almost 300 Sejm deputies  for the coalition.    [Falandysz] Imagine a prime minister who does not enjoy the  support of the head of state. How could he represent Poland  abroad? Theoretically, the prime minister could be dismissed and  a new government formed. The president could make that  difficult.    [Kublik] In what way?    [Falandysz] The Small Constitution provides that the  president has a final say in appointing a government, even if  the government was elected by the Sejm. But the president also  has the possibility of not appointing such a cabinet.    [Kublik] Why? After all, appointing a cabinet is just a  formality because the Sejm has voted it through, anyway.    [Falandysz] If one were to interpret the Constitution in a  presidential-parliamentary way, there is the possibility of the  president not appointing a government. The Small Constitution  clearly provides: "in case the Council of Ministers is not  appointed..." So that means that the president does not have to  make the appointment. And, if there is no government formed,  the president could dissolve parliament.    Do you know that there are countries where the president is  always empowered to dissolve parliament? Such a possibility is  contained in the Belweder's constitutional draft.    [Kublik] Is the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] the  Belweder's main enemy right now? It does not look like Walesa  is attacking the Polish Peasant Party [PSL].    [Falandysz] Let me put in another way: It is not the PSL  that is behind all of the antipresidential measures. It is the  SLD that is antipresidential. From the very beginning, SLD men  have wanted to reduce presidential powers. And then there were  their attempts, aimed at the three Belweder ministries. Walesa  has for years fought the kind of regime that is currently being  promoted by what is today the SLD, where the United Peasant  Accord was just a vassal. And this is the way it continues to  be. I once said that the president treats Pawlak as his younger  brother. But one can still have arguments, even with one's  younger brother.    [Kublik] The SLD accuses Walesa of striving for  dictatorship.    [Falandysz] That is rubbish. All the president does is  maintain his constitutional powers. They find it extremely hard  to come to terms with the fact that he, for instance, makes  decisions on personnel issues in the Defense, Internal Affairs,  and Foreign Affairs Ministries. They are used to a  monopoly--they have to have everything: the finance minister,  the ownership transformations minister, the police, the Army,  foreign affairs, and the chief customs official.    [Kublik] Will the president meet the SLD Sejm Deputies Club  at Kwasniewski's invitation?    [Falandysz] I am not sure it is a good idea for the  president to hold meetings with political parties. The  Constitution provides for another possibility: Article 38  states that "regarding issues of special importance to the  state, the president is empowered to call sessions of the  Council of Ministers and to chair them." I think that would be  a more appropriate forum for a constructive debate on the  current situation.</p>

			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / Balladur awaits polls verdict Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, was last night anxiously awaiting the outcome of the first round of voting in France's local council elections. It is the first significant test of confidence in his centre-right government since its election last March. Yesterday's vote, in 2,018 of France's 4,033 cantons, or local council wards, comes at a critical time for Mr Balladur, whose popularity has slipped in recent months on concern about high unemployment and a wave of violent strikes and demonstrations. Mr Balladur, whose capable manner made him one of Europe's most popular politicians during his first months in office, has already seen his approval rating fall from 55 per cent to about 50 per cent since the end of last year. The prime minister, who is still tipped as a contender for the centre-right candidacy in next spring's presidential elections, desperately needs to secure a vote of support in the local poll, which will be concluded with a second round of voting next Sunday. 'If we win, nobody will say anything, but if we lose, people will attack the government,' said Mr Charles Pasqua, the interior minister who was a candidate yesterday. The vote includes half the seats in each of France's 95 conseils, or general councils. The other seats will be up for re-election in three years. Opinion polls last week predicted that the Balladur centre-right coalition, whichp already controls 75 of the 95 conseils generals, would win up to 200 extra seats, following next Sunday's second round.</p>

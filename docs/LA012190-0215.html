			<p><P> January 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GENERAL OF LIFE &amp; DEATH;  </P> <P> CONTROVERSIAL SUPREME COURT CASES REFLECT EFFORTS OF MISSOURI'S WILLIAM WEBSTER  </P> <P> Here in the heart of what bicoastal snobs call fly-over country, folks are  helping to decide how the nation will live and die.  </P> <P> Last year, the office of William L. Webster, Missouri's 36-year-old attorney  general, brought three cases before the U. S. Supreme Court that directly touch  on the issues of when life begins and when and how it might end.  </P> <P> In one case, the Supreme Court accepted Missouri's argument that the state's  planned execution of 16-year-old Heath Wilkins would not be cruel and unusual.  </P> <P> In a case argued in December but yet to be decided, Missouri asserted its right  to prevent the family of 25-year-old Nancy Cruzan -- who has remained in a  "persistent vegetative state" since a 1983 automobile accident -- to remove the  water and nutrition tube that keeps her body functioning. The court's decision  is predicted to affect tens of thousands of families with comatose loved ones.  </P> <P> And in July of last year, the Supreme Court issued a ruling in Webster vs.  Reproductive Health Services that many observers believe has undermined the  1973 Roe vs. Wade decision, which guarantees women the right to abortion.  Underlying Missouri's argument was its clearly stated position that "the life  of each human being begins at conception."  </P> <P> Last century, in a Missouri-based case most citizens of the state would rather  forget, the Supreme Court decided that neither Dred Scott nor any other Negro  could be a citizen under the Constitution. The decision helped trigger the  Civil War.  </P> <P> Now, as the countdown to the 21st Century begins, the state that spawned such  wise and folksy thinkers as Mark Twain and Harry S. Truman is again asserting  itself as a key player in determining what may be some of the most divisive  issues since slavery.  </P> <P> Webster -- who some folks call "The General," and others "our whiz kid" -- says  he has become a gatekeeper of historical currents as the result of "an amazing  confluence of events . . . " His job is to defend the laws of his state,  whether he likes them or not, he asserts. And he bristles at being seen as a  symbol for any cause.  </P> <P> But Webster's critics say that like it or not, The General is irrevocably  linked to an image of godlike arrogance concerning the government's role in  decisions of life and death.  </P> <P> "His name means one thing to millions of people all over the country -- it  means a violation of women's rights," said Mary Bryant, director of public  affairs for Planned Parenthood of Missouri.  </P> <P> Last fall, several thousand people -- 10,000 by pro-choice estimates --  gathered near Webster's Jefferson City office and sang "Bye-bye Billy." One  speaker told the group: "There's only one woman in this entire state who wants  Bill Webster in her bedroom, and that's Mrs. Webster."  </P> <P> "I'm a hero and I'm an enemy," Webster acknowledged with a smile.  </P> <P> To understand a person, it's often necessary to know something about his  father. To find out about William L. Webster's dad, one need only step out of  the big brick Missouri Supreme Court building in Jefferson City and walk across  the street to the Capitol.  </P> <P> "Jeff City," as locals call the town, is exactly what a U.S. state capital is  supposed to look like. Its fringes may be fraying into strips of McDonald's and  Pizza Huts. But its core looks essentially the way it must have before this  "border state" splintered into Union and Confederate factions in the Civil War.  </P> <P> The Capitol -- a Romanesque, high-domed building of gray marble overlooking the  Missouri River -- radiates an aura of statesmanship. Thomas Jefferson stands  watch on the steps and Thomas Harte Benton's social realist murals decorate the  soaring interior.  </P> <P> A thin man, raw-boned and mildly disheveled, with his graying hair swept back  in a classic country lawyer wave, Sen. Richard M. Webster is quick to spin  folksy tales about his state's political workings. But the casual demeanor is  misleading.  </P> <P> The elder Webster has been a Missouri lawmaker for more than 40 years, serving  three terms in the House and now completing his fifth in the Senate. Although  the senator never fulfilled his dreams of becoming attorney general or  governor, local pundits call him the most powerful man in Missouri politics.  </P> <P> "He is seen as very ruthless and cunning," said former Lt. Gov. Harriett Woods,  adding that "those terms are both used in very respectful ways in the political  field."  </P> <P> Lately though, Sen. Webster's son has begun to eclipse him in the spotlight.  His son, he said, has nine ancestors who served in Missouri's House of  Representatives. "It's kind of a genetic thing."  </P> <P> The younger Webster grew up in Carthage, where he is considered the second most  famous native son -- after television naturalist Marlin Perkins, whom the town  has honored with a statue.  </P> <P> Carthage is Jefferson City writ small. Clean, quiet, safe and friendly, the  town of 12,000 is everything New York and Los Angeles are not.  </P> <P> Growing up in Carthage in the '60s, young Webster said he never knew of a drug  problem. He never even heard rumors of anyone having an abortion, which was  illegal in Missouri. "It was just a much more innocent time than today -- which  is not to say people didn't get pregnant, not to say abortions didn't take  place."  </P> <P> Each summer, when Mark Twain Elementary School, and later Carthage High, let  out, "Billy" accompanied his father to the capital, sleeping on a cot in a  motel room Richard Webster shared with another senator. By day, he worked as a  senate page; each night, he listened as a bipartisan cast of lawmakers met to  talk politics and strategy in his father's motel room.  </P> <P> Back at Carthage High, the boy pushed hard in other directions. His class of  250 elected him vice president, "Most Likely to Succeed" and prom king. He  became editor of the yearbook and newspaper, photographer for sporting events  and landed the lead in several student plays. He also became a top debater,  earning a scholarship to the University of Kansas.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, at 16, he had begun working 40 hours a week at the local radio  station, as everything from sportscaster to disc jockey. After graduating from  high school in 1971, he set up an entrepreneurial radio network; 18 stations  aired his coverage of the 1972 Republican and Democratic National Conventions,  including, Webster said, the first interview with old family friend and  surprise Democratic vice-presidential nominee Thomas F. Eagleton.  </P> <P> Sen. Webster had intended to go into journalism; on a whim, he chose law  school. General Webster graduated with a journalism degree, then earned his law  degree from the University of Missouri-Kansas City.  </P> <P> In 1980, William Webster was elected to the Missouri General Assembly, where he  was voted one of two outstanding new members in his first term; in his second  term, his colleagues named him an outstanding lawmaker. Now in his second term  as attorney general, Webster may well be on the way to fulfilling his father's  political ambitions: until recently, he was considered something of a shoo-in  for governor in 1992.  </P> <P> But whatever Webster picked up from his father's GOP-style politicking was  transformed by the irresistible media forces that shaped the consciousness of  baby boomers everywhere. He may have absorbed Richard Nixon's credo as a boy  but it was John F. Kennedy's style that sunk in.  </P> <P> On a wall behind Sen. Webster's desk hang two photographs, circa late 1960s.  Both show an intent young William Webster, sporting hair reminiscent of Donny  Osmond in his mod phase. On the wall of The General's own large, wood-paneled  office in the Supreme Court building, photos show him as a tall, crisply  groomed, downright presidential-looking figure in the company of conservative  icons Ronald Reagan, Bob Dole and George Bush.  </P> <P> Webster has 107 attorneys on his staff, a third of whom he has appointed, more  than half of them women. He said he never questions those who work with him  about their political beliefs -- one of his appointees was a George McGovern  campus recruiter. But an aura of Young Republicanism permeates the place, where  The General often can be found tinkering with the new Macintosh and IBM  hardware that he has championed and that now fills desks throughout the office.  </P> <P> At a recent Monday morning chief counsel's meeting, key attorneys gathered to  discuss the week's agenda. As it happened, one of them -- a Webster boyhood  friend whose father was a state representative -- was celebrating his 36th  birthday; the group wolfed down birthday cake, chasing it with Diet Sprites and  Diet Cokes. Seated at the head of the table in the conference room, Webster set  a wry, jocular tone for the talk, which bounced from deep legalities, to  college basketball, to the politics of rural Missouri courts and even to an  execution pending that night.  </P> <P> Openly competitive and hungry for important cases, Webster and his staff  crisscross the state by plane, train and automobile, touching down at their  four regional offices and in whichever rural courthouse their growing caseloads  land them.  </P> <P> The first U. S. Supreme Court case to draw big-time publicity for The General  and his staff was Wilkins vs. Missouri, in which the justices decided that  executing criminals who were age 16 when they committed a crime did not  necessarily constitute cruel and unusual punishment.  </P> <P> Webster did not argue the case himself; his office, he said, had little choice  but to defend state court decisions. His personal views on the case, and  capital punishment, in general, trace to issues of where the U. S. Constitution  and states' rights intersect and to issues of personal responsibility.  </P> <P> Webster said he knows little about Wilkins' upbringing. But if it was less than  perfect, he said, "it doesn't give him a license to go into a liquor store  after plotting a murder and slit a woman's throat, watch her beg, and then  watch her bleed to death."  </P> <P> The High Court's decision in Wilkins, coupled with a decision allowing the  execution of mentally retarded murderers, triggered a national outcry from  capital-punishment opponents and civil libertarians.  </P> <P> Back in Missouri, Webster's office tends to receive more day-to-day attention  for the less sweeping cases it pursues; in 1988, Ad Week magazine named him  "one of the 10 most feared attorneys general" because of the consumer  protection lawsuits filed by his office.  </P> <P> Critics, however, have suggested that his office itself needs lessons about  truth in advertising. The St. Louis Post Dispatch and Kansas City Times both  failed to endorse Webster in the 1988 election because of issues raised by  opponents. The Kansas City Times chided Webster for his unwillingness to join  other attorneys general in taking on the insurance industry; the paper also  chastised him for a suspect settlement with a nursing home that had contributed  to his campaign.  </P> <P> Webster writes off the criticisms as "sour grapes." His actions were based on  sound legal judgments, as recent court decisions show, he said: "What we are  doing here is an exciting, stimulating, significant sort of law. . . . My  record as attorney general suggests we have a progressive, some might call it  Populist office -- that we're interested in many of the same things (California  Atty. Gen.) John Van de Kamp has been involved in."  </P> <P> But his detractors say that The General -- named an "Outstanding Young  American" by the U.S. Junior Chamber of Commerce -- offers Missourians more  sizzle than steak, too many slick press releases for too little real legal  action.  </P> <P> "Every little consumer investigation starts out with a huge press conference,  yet most of them result in suits that generally have very little benefit to the  public," said Frank Susman, the St. Louis attorney who argued against Webster  in the Reproductive Health Services case.  </P> <P> Michael Wolff, a St. Louis University law professor who challenged Webster in  the 1988 attorney-general race, paints his adversary as a political automaton,  eager to have his name associated with landmark cases, even those, like the  Cruzan case, that he had relegated to assistants.  </P> <P> "Every decision that he makes is to further his political career," Wolff said.  "Sometimes that is consistent with the best interests of the state and  sometimes that's not."  </P> <P> The irony, critics say, is that the two most publicized cases with which  Webster has associated himself seem to have backfired.  </P> <P> Seated in his office, he kicks his shoes up on his desk and clasps his hands  behind his head. "People think that the cases you take are your essence, if you  will," he said, the trace of Andy of Mayberry in his voice giving his words a  folksy spin. What they don't understand, he said, is that he took an oath to  defend Missouri's laws, regardless of his personal views.  </P> <P> Personally, Webster believes that life begins at conception and that Roe vs.  Wade was flawed -- that there is no fundamental right to abortion. He believes  that abortion is essentially a moral decision best determined by individual  states -- the key issue of the landmark case bearing his name, he says.  </P> <P> But in the Cruzan case, his own feelings and the decision he had to defend did  not mesh well, he said.  </P> <P> The Cruzan tragedy began with a 1983 automobile wreck that left 25-year-old  Nancy Cruzan in what doctors have termed "a persistent vegetative state."  </P> <P> For four years, her parents attended to their hospitalized daughter. For four  years, they saw no sign she was conscious and received no encouragement she  would recover. In October, 1987, a Jasper County Circuit Court judge ruled that  her parents had the right to order a hospital to remove a food and water tube  that had maintained their daughter's limited existence.  </P> <P> The General appealed that decision; the state Supreme Court overturned the  lower court. Arguing that her family and not the state should decide their  daughter's fate, the Cruzans took their case to the U.S. Supreme Court.  </P> <P> From the beginning, Webster says he believed in the Cruzan family's good  intentions; he sympathized with their heartbreaking dilemma. At issue, however,  was whether constitutional guarantees of freedom and privacy entitle a family  to remove food and water from someone whose own wishes were unclear.  </P> <P> "There's got to be some kind of safeguard," he said, "so that someone can't  snuff Grandma when there's no one there to speak for her."  </P> <P> Webster himself has a "living will," detailing how he wants to be treated  should he meet a fate similar to Nancy Cruzan's. But he will not discuss it and  said its "provisions are personal, between me and my wife and family."  </P> <P> Even before the Cruzan case arrived at the Supreme Court, however, Webster was  working with state legislators to create a process to decide when it was  appropriate to withdraw life supports, including food and water.  </P> <P> On Jan. 10, he announced the bill at a press conference in Jefferson City, then  flew in a state plane with staff to press conferences in Joplin and  Springfield, where Webster exuded the self-assurance of a crackerjack  collegiate debater.  </P> <P> To his left, sat Sen. Dennis Smith, who introduced the legislation. To his  right, sat the father of the comatose Nancy Cruzan. Eyes flooding with tears,  Joseph Cruzan gazed into the swarm of television cameras and said he supports  the bill, which may finally end his family's soul-wrenching ordeal and help  other Missouri families.  </P> <P> But like most life and death matters, the proposed bill has stirred  controversy, as well as emotions.  </P> <P> Critics see it as a cynical nod to a growing public sentiment against the  government making decisions for families, while Missouri's strong right-to-life  movement thinks Webster has betrayed their cause. "We were disappointed that  General Webster proposed and is supporting that legislation," said Carol  Scoville, chairwoman of the antiabortion Missouri Citizens for Life. "We feel  strongly that all human life should be protected."  </P> <P> Even more problematic for Webster is the landmark Webster vs. Reproductive  Health Services decision, which pro-choice forces have vowed to turn into the  most important issue of the 1992 governor's race.  </P> <P> That complex case was summarized by Webster in a press release: "We think  states should be allowed to determine the point at which unborn children are  entitled to the protections of state law."  </P> <P> Although the Webster case clearly gave it the opportunity, the Supreme Court  did not go so far as to overturn the 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision, giving women  the right to abortion. The court did decide that Missouri constitutionally may  restrict public employees from performing nontherapeutic abortions and that the  state can require physicians to perform fetal viability tests.  </P> <P> After the June 3 decision, The General's office issued a press release  headlined "Webster Calls Supreme Court Abortion Decision 'Great Victory.' "  Antiabortion forces cheered.  </P> <P> But previously ineffective pro-choice activists used the decision as a rallying  point and quickly gathered themselves into a powerful political force.  </P> <P> Bryant, of Planned Parenthood, and others believe Webster was stunned by the  reaction to the Supreme Court decision and has tried to distance himself from  the case since. "He's trying to stop like a cat on slick linoleum," she said.  </P> <P> Webster, however, replied: "If I wanted to be a cautious, milquetoast type of  politician, I'd never take on anything controversial . . . If people want to  call that political courage or stupidity, that's their option."  </P> <P> Besides, contrary to his critics' impressions, "I'm not driven by an obsession  to hold another office . . . " he said. "I grew up in a house where public  service was given very high priority. There are lots of people who have made  incredible contributions and are unsung. That's a noble thing."  </P> <P> Meantime, three committees, including one called Fund for Missouri's Future,  have raised $733,298 for Webster. Most observers believe the money is earmarked  for the 1992 governor's race.  </P> <P> Earlier this month, Webster seemed content just to sit at the left of Missouri  Gov. John D. Ashcroft as he delivered his State of the State address.  </P> <P> The governor began his conservative, law-and-order, antiabortion talk by  lauding Missourians for being on the cutting edge of change. Quoting Thomas  Paine, he said: "We have it within our own power to begin the world over  again."  </P> <P> Webster applauded politely.  </P> <P>  Janet Lundblad in the Times' editorial library contributed research to this  article.  </P> <P> </P></p>

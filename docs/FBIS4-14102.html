			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Aharon Barne'a video report from Cairo] </F>   [Excerpts] There will be no agreement between the PLO and  Israel unless a timetable is determined for the release of all  Palestinian prisoners, including Hamas [Islamic Resistance  Movement] members. This was said today by Dr. Ahmad al-Tibi,  'Arafat's adviser. It was reported in Cairo today that the  delegations will continue their meetings next week. The date  for the signing of the agreement has still not been determined.    [Begin recording] [passage omitted] [Al-Tibi] Without an  agreed-upon timetable for the release of all the Palestinian  prisoners there will be no agreement.    [Barne'a] Are you referring to all the prisoners, including  Hamas people?    [Al-Tibi] All the prisoners are Palestinians, and the PLO is  the legitimate leadership of the entire Palestinian people,  therefore it is responsible for all prisoners, regardless of  their affiliation.

			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Wellcome anti-migraine drug threat for Glaxo Wellcome, the UK drugs group, has thrown down a challenge to its rival, Glaxo, by reporting successful tests of a new anti-migraine drug. The development of the drug - codenamed 311C-90 - could threaten the market dominance of Imigran, one of Glaxo's fastest-growing products which had sales of Pounds 116m last year. Although Wellcome is not expected to seek regulatory approval for the new drug for at least two years, it said it had the potential for 'previously unachieved levels of safety and efficacy'. City analysts said the market for such a drug was worth at least Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) and could, in time, exceed the market for anti-asthma treatments - currently worth some Dollars 4bn. 'Glaxo should be concerned about this development. It is the first real threat to Imigran,' said one analyst. The challenge coincided with news that Glaxo had alerted US physicians about possible drug-associated deaths linked to Imitrex, the name used for Imigran in North America. The manufacturer, however, said the vast majority of Imitrex users had not suffered any side effects, and the few fatalities were linked to exceptional circumstances where the patients been given the drug despite a history of cardiovascular diseases and other risk factors such as asthma. Wellcome, meanwhile, said its drug had shown no effects on blood pressure or cardiovascular problems during clinical trials. Those trials showed that 62 per cent of patients suffering migraine found a 'striking reduction' in pain within two hours. Glaxo said its tablet form of Imigran showed a 50 per cent success rate over the same period, although it showed an 80 per cent improvement in its injected form. Analysts predict sales of Imigran could exceed Dollars 480m in the 12 months to July this year, even though the drug has not yet become widely available in tablet form. Wellcome shares, which fell 14p to 685p earlier this amid concern at possible sedative side-effects of the drug, closed up 1p at 686p. Glaxo, which is expected to report full year profits of between Pounds 1.88bn and Pounds 1.9bn today, recovered to 622p, after closing down 13 1/2 p at 620p on Tuesday on news of Wellcome's drug development.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin says the katyusha that  fell on the Galilee was fired by a marginal organization. Our  correspondent Shmu'el Tal reports from the broadcast van at the  Labor Party building:    [Begin recording] [Tal] The Labor Party Bureau is today  addressing many issues. Among other things, Prime Minister  Rabin was asked about the katyusha attack in the north. Rabin  said this attack was contrary to all the understandings attained  in the wake of Operation Accountability. He noted, however,  that there was no basic change in the situation:    [Rabin] Our understandings with Syria regarding Hizballah  remain in effect. Today we know the katyusha was launched by a  splinter Palestinian group that seceded from Fatah due to its  opposition to the Declaration of Principles in particular and to  the peace process in general. We will operate as we deem  necessary. This organization calls itself the Black 13 September  Organization -- this does not refer to the 13th of September  1970, but rather to 1993. I believe that this is a marginal  organization that does not even approximate the magnitude of  threat posed by Hizballah. The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] will  find the appropriate way to deal with this issue.    [Tal] Referring to Syria, Rabin said the ball is now in its  court. Progress depends not only on Israel, but on Syria as  well.    [Rabin] Why is there no progress? Because Syria poses  demands we cannot accept. We must adhere to our positions, and  if Syria wants peace it must adjust to our demands and meet us  halfway. [end recording]</p>

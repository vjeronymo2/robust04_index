			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. The Onboard Diagnostics Issue  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Prior to the Administrator's November 30, 1994 finding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerning emission effects, three auto manufacturers, Ford,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> General Motors (GM), and Chrysler, and the American Automobile  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Manufacturers Association (AAMA), all commented on concerns about  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the impact of the oxidative products of MMT on onboard diagnostic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (OBD II) systems employing before-catalyst and after-catalyst  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> oxygen sensors. <FOOTCITE>48</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 48 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> An Onboard Diagnostic System, with the present generation commonly known as OBD&hyph;II, monitors the activity of an automobile's emission control system, primarily the catalytic converter, and alerts the driver via a dashboard light in the event of a malfunction. Put simply, this aspect of the OBD system functions by utilizing devices before and after the catalyst which ``sense'' the presence of oxygen. If the catalyst is functioning properly, it will absorb a certain amount of oxygen and a specified decrease in oxygen content in the exhaust gases can be determined by comparing the oxygen ``sensed'' before and after the catalyst. If the catalyst is functioning improperly, oxygen storage by the catalyst is impaired and a drop in exhaust gas oxygen after the catalyst beyond the proper range is ``sensed'' by the OBD system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> GM concerns regarding the OBD II system were two-fold. Its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> first concern was that since it is known that manganese oxide has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the ability to store oxygen, a potential problem could occur with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dual oxygen sensor systems. GM stated that, with manganese oxide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> covering the catalyst and the oxygen sensors, a false oxygen  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> storage capacity of the catalyst could be indicated by the OBD II  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system, which could then indicate that the catalyst was still  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> working properly while the opposite could be true. GM's second  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concern was that the catalyst would act as a ``filter'' and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manganese oxide from MMT combustion passing through the exhaust  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system would coat the before-catalyst oxygen sensor and after-catalyst oxygen sensors unevenly, thus causing the OBD II system  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to malfunction. GM also stated that in the 1994 model year GM  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> planned to market two engine families equipped with OBD II  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> systems employing before- and after-catalyst oxygen sensors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to the automakers' concern that use of MMT  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would adversely affect operation of the OBD II system, on July  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 15, 1993, Ethyl submitted data which it believed demonstrated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that this concern has no basis. <FOOTCITE>49</FOOTCITE>  Ethyl stated that no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> production vehicles were then equipped with OBD&hyph;II systems and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the primary hardware approach being considered by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> automobile manufacturers involves the use of exhaust gas oxygen  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (EGO) sensors before and after the catalytic converter to monitor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> converter efficiency. Ethyl further commented that test data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generated by Ethyl showed that use of the additive would have no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adverse effect on either the hardware component of these planned  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ODB&hyph;II systems (i.e., the oxygen sensors), or on the catalytic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> converter itself. Ethyl noted that, ``[s]ince these future  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> systems are currently under development, it is impossible to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consider the long term effects of MMT on these systems.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 49 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See Public Docket A&hyph;93&hyph;26, Number II&hyph;D&hyph;8, Appendix 5. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On November 4, 1994, only 26 days prior to the mandatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> date for a decision on Ethyl's waiver application, Ford Motor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Company submitted a report describing bench testing <FOOTCITE>50</FOOTCITE>  of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> catalysts, in which Ford measured the oxygen storage capacity of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> catalysts which had been deliberately degraded and then exposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the emissions from MMT-containing fuel. Ford's conclusion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> based on these tests was that the exhaust gas oxygen (EGO)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sensors would be affected by the deposition of manganese oxides  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> associated with MMT use, thus sending incorrect signals to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> diagnostic control system in the vehicle.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 50 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Bench testing means the testing of components during which time the components are not actually in the vehicle. The details of this testing can be found in Document II&hyph;D&hyph;56 in Docket A&hyph;93&hyph;26. (An incomplete preliminary report of this information was submitted to the Agency in Document II&hyph;D&hyph;38, Docket A&hyph;93&hyph;26.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although the Agency regarded the concerns expressed by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ford in its November 4, 1994 submission regarding the effect of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MMT use on OBD systems as potentially very important, based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the very limited analysis which could be undertaken prior to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> November 30, 1994 deadline for a decision concerning Ethyl's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application, the Agency concluded that the limited bench testing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submitted by Ford did not allow a conclusion concerning the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> likelihood that a significant impact would actually occur during  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicle operation. In addition, the Agency had several questions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regarding the procedures involved in the Ford testing which could  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not be resolved within the available time. The November 30, 1994  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notice announcing the Administrator's determination concerning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission effects made it clear that EPA was concerned about this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issue and would retain the authority to take appropriate action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the future pursuant to Clean Air Act Section 211(c).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA met with staff of Ford in February of 1994 in order to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discuss Ford's concerns raised in its November 4, 1993  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submission. Ford generally expressed the same concerns as had  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been expressed by GM (and discussed above). <FOOTCITE>51</FOOTCITE>  According to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ford, its testing showed that combustion of gasoline containing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MMT deposits a layer of manganese oxide on top of the catalyst  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> washcoat and that this causes the EGO Sensor to measure a lower  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> oxygen level, thereby indicating a higher oxygen storage capacity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than that which would be indicated by the catalyst without MMT.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a result, a malfunctioning catalyst might not be detected.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ford expressed particular concern because it had just introduced  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> three 1994 model year vehicle families employing OBD&hyph;II, whereas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the other automakers will not have systems out until the 1996  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> model year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 51 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Ford's concerns are discussed in more detail in a memo to docket A&hyph;93&hyph;26, with an attachment submitted to the Agency entitled ``Section 211(c) Impacts of MMT''. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Recently, on May 3, 1993, Ford submitted additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information which the Agency is currently reviewing. This new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information appears to provide further evidence to substantiate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the concerns expressed by Ford regarding the impact of MMT use on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OBD systems. Unlike the previously submitted Ford data, the new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data address an actual production vehicle fitted with a failed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> catalyst and the effect use of MMT had on the OBD system's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ability to detect failure of the catalyst.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (The Budget and You): Bonds battle on the 8 per cent line - Wall Street FORGET Super Tuesday. Wall Street's number one concern over the past week has not been the battle for the south in Tuesday's presidential primary race, but a rather more mundane tussle in the bond market. Call it the battle of 8 per cent. First, a little background: two big factors underpinned the sharp run up in US share prices which occurred around the turn of the year. One was falling short-term interest rates, which not only looked like helping an economic recovery, but also made shares seem a more attractive investment than many fixed income securities. The other was the belief that after last summer's false dawn, the economy really was on the mend. However, for the past few weeks interest rates across the maturity spectrum have been edging up again, making stocks not quite so attractive in comparison. No-where has this been more dramatic than at the long-end of the Government bond market, where yields have remained stubbornly high, despite successive rounds of monetary easing by the Federal Reserve, and this week shot briefly through 8 per cent. No one knows for sure just why long bond yields have remained so high when inflation is around 3.5 per cent and expected to fall further. But at least part of the reason is disbelief that inflation is really licked, and a fear that a combination of fiscal stimuli and an upswing in economic activity this year will set off another upward price spiral. President Bush did little to ease those fears this week when he said he was 'more concerned about stimulating the economy than pushing (interest) rates down.' That helped push long bond prices down on Wednesday and the following day they fell even more after the the publication of surprisingly robust retail sales figures for February. Analysts saw the figures as evidence that the economy is on the mend. The result was to push the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond  - which moves in the opposite direction to the bond's price - through the 8 per cent barrier for the first time since November, making fixed income securities even more attractive compared to stocks. The yield dropped below 8 per cent again yesterday morning, thanks to an increase in producer prices during February that was more modest than expected. But the creeping upward advance of interest rates, and diminishing hopes of a further Fed easing, will continue to act as a powerful restraint on the stock markets. Less clear is the extent to which equities will be able to balance its hopes of economic recovery, which would eventually boost corporate profits and dividends, against its concern over interest rates. Certainly, this week's retail sales figures, when added to a raft of other mildly encouraging statistics, suggest that some sort of recovery is under way. But its momentum remains uncertain, and there are fears that it might yet be choked off by rising interest rates. So far there have been relatively few signs from industrial America that a strong revival of activity is under way, although a survey of business executives published yesterday by the New York Times said almost half now said they saw some inkling of improvement. But until the recovery signals turn much brighter, it is hard to see the Dow making much headway above its current trading range, with some risk that it could fall through its 3,200 floor if interest rates continue on their upward trend. The Super-Tuesday primaries may have made little impact on Wall Street - given that President Bush won comfortable victories against right-winger Pat Buchanan - but a little local tussle in Detroit, Michigan, home of the motor industry, raised a few eyebrows. The directors of Chrysler, the financially strapped automobile manufacturer, seem to be having a problem choosing a successor to Lee Iacocca, the chairman who saved the company from near bankruptcy early in the 1980s but then sullied his reputation by ill-judged diversification. Iacocca is due to retire at the end of this year, yet after months of deliberation the board has yet to name a replacement, much to the disatisfaction of some of its major shareholders. The internal front-runner is Robert Lutz, a design and engineering expert, who has done much to restore the company's name for interesting vehicles. But this week Robert Eaton, head of the highly profitable European operations at arch-rival General Motors, let slip that he had twice talked to Iacocca about joining Chrysler in some capacity.  --------------------------------------- Monday       3215.12    -    6.48  --------------------------------------- Tuesday      3230.99    +   15.87  --------------------------------------- Wednesday    3208.63    -   22.36  --------------------------------------- Thursday     3208.63    -      --  --------------------------------------- Friday       3235.91    +   27.28  ---------------------------------------</p>

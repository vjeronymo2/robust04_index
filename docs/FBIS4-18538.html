			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Economics Minister Guenther Rexrodt: "A </F> Necessary Partnership Between International Trade and the  Environment"]    [Text] Bonn -- Following seven years of negotiations,  which were frequently marked by difficult, frequently  unbridgeable differences not only between partners from the  northern and southern hemispheres, but also between the states  belonging to the European Union [EU], a treaty will be signed in  Marrakesh, a treaty that represents more than just a stage on  the way to a liberal world trade system that will benefit  everyone.    With their signatures, the representatives of 117 states  will  not only eliminate the danger of a new form of protectionism and  of a trade war in the event of negotiations collapsing, but they  will set in motion a new process at the end of which -- in so  far as such a process can have an end -- an extensive, fair and  balanced world trade system, one integrating north, south, east,  west, will be possible, a system, which in addition to bringing  benefits for the individuals, also takes into account global  aspects.    At the beginning of an economic upturn, this positive  conclusion of negotiations will bolster the confidence of  business and all those involved in the economy -- entrepreneurs  and consumers, investors and manufacturers. On the one hand,  the conclusion of the negotiations creates conditions for our  companies to have worldwide improved access to existing and  expanding new markets. On the other hand, what it provides for  consumers is a larger, price-orientated supply of goods and  services.    Even if it is difficult to give a precise figure for the  "the  economic gains" that will emerge in the long and short term,  directly and indirectly, for the parties concerned, it can  nevertheless be stated that the gains and advantages will amount  to several hundred billion.  <H5>  The Difficulties in Implementing the Results of the </H5> Negotiations    However, what seems much more important to me is the higher  degree of awareness with regard to cooperation in world trade,  the extensive transfer of technology and know-how, the greater  integration of developing countries and the countries of  central, southeastern, and eastern Europe as well the former  states of the Soviet Union into world trade and the  international division of labor.    The end of the Uruguay Round is only the goal of a certain  stage. In the ongoing process of liberalizing trade, we are only  at the beginning of a more difficult phase, the implementation  of results, creating the structures of new world trade  organization, and especially the treatment of subjects the  importance of which has been recognized, but in view of their  complexity, could not be settled in these past negotiations.  These subjects include issues relating to trade and  competition, especially -- and I am personally concerned about  this -- the field of trade and the environment, which contains  many problems.    Those points of overlap between foreign trade and  environmental protection are being discussed more extensively  thanks to public opinion, which set the process in motion and  induced governments to take action.    There are two contrasting patterns of thinking: Some believe  that international trade, as the engine of the world economy,  definitely affects the environment -- possibly in a negative way  -- but that liberalization may be of benefit to the environment  if, on the one hand, the more effective and more economic use of  resources is maintained and, on the other hand, more prosperity  is created. That is why, especially in countries that are  dependent on the export of raw materials, there would also be  more money for environmental protection, investment in the  environment, the purchase of appropriate technology, but also  training, including further training, and the combating of  poverty.    The opposing party is no less strong and is definitely also  armed with good, weighty arguments, and it places environmental  protection above all else. It indulges in wishful thinking  about a zero burden on the environment combined with zero  growth, without revealing what possibilities there are  particularly for leading developing countries out of their  difficult situation, the hopelessness of overpopulation,  poverty, environmental damage, and technological and economic  backwardness. This area of overlap is a key area for action and  a main concern in the future work of the world trade  organization.    The parties to GATT have decided that the UN Conference on  Economic Development process should be taken up by GATT, and  that particularly entails promoting lasting development through  the liberalization of trade as well as mutual support on the  part of trade and environment politicians. The particular  importance of the principles contained in Chapter 2.22 of  Charter 21, namely, the necessity of international cooperation  and the condemnation of unilateral measures, has been stressed.    The elements of the work program have already been discussed  and fixed within the framework of the Trade Negotiating  Committee. Decisions about it should also be made in Marrakesh.  However, to my mind, the start that has been made is  insufficient. There are significant aspects and partial  problems that have not been addressed. We must approach these  general problems in a more comprehensive manner.    In my opinion, there are two viewpoints that should be the  basis of further action: The intensification of the  international division of labor combined with a marked increase  in the volume of trade -- also as a result of the liberalizing  effects of the Uruguay Round -- are to be welcomed in view of  their positive effects on economic growth and development and  should be promoted. However, a healthy and intact environment  -- it is the basis for life, and without it, no trade would be  possible -- is an increasingly scarce commodity and one whose  status is becoming increasingly important in all countries.    If a contradiction is perceived in that, then it is only  apparently so. It is entirely possible for environmental  protection and liberal international trade to be made  compatible, assuming that rules are comprehensible, clearly  defined, consider both areas, and clearly established.    Long before the conclusion of the GATT round, the  representatives of diverse institutions called for a "green  round" or talked of the necessity of "greening the GATT."  However, the question one must really ask oneself is if the  current GATT rules -- applied correctly and in accordance with  the principles -- which have created a worldwide legal framework  for international trade, also provide such a framework for  environmental protection measures?    Do present GATT regulations really fail to provide a balance  between the right people that have to determine paths and goals,  to protect their health and the environment and the right to  profit from trade that is as liberal as possible?  <H5>  Abuses Can Be Prevented Now </H5>   Is there really a need for "greening the GATT" or to create  special GATT exceptions that justify the introduction of  restrictions on trade or compensatory tariffs for environmental  protection reasons, such as the protection of tropical  rainforests or reduce carbon dioxide emission levels? Or is it  the case that regulations about nondiscrimination provide much  better protection against measures that harm the international  trading system, being resorted to under the pretext of  environmental protection?    A comparison of the economic, political, and legal status of  various environmental protection instruments shows GATT  regulations already contain possibilities for using  environmental protection instruments efficiently and preventing  their abuse by using environmental grounds as an excuse.  <H5>  State Independence </H5>   GATT goals, namely "the full use of world resources for  development" (GATT preamble), by way of banning obscure,  discriminatory or unreasonable trading restrictions and  distortions also apply to our environmental resources. The  consistent application of GATT environmental policy measures  will make it much more likely that the goals of the policy will  be achieved and, at the same time, will represent a model for  the production, use, consumption and reprocessing of goods.    Thus, the authors of GATT have taken a much broader view  than  one suspects and -- perhaps this is not perceptible and apparent  to everyone -- established a basis for environmental protection  in the regulations on trade.    GATT proceeds from the principle of state independence.  Every member state has the freedom to introduce internal taxes  and regulations and is at liberty to employ other protection  measures for reasons of environmental protection. The current  settlement contained in Article 22 in conjunction with GATT  makes that perfectly clear! The use of measures to protect the  goods listed there is permitted, but, as always within the  framework of GATT, not in a groundless and unlimited way. These  measures come under GATT basic principles and are conditioned to  that extent.    Thus, the GATT regulations not only empower the parties to  resort to measures and employ instruments that are necessary  from the viewpoint of economists. They have also always  provided a basis for measures called for by ecologists to the  extent that they deal with trade issues. The question is not  "whether," but "whether it is enough?" In this area too,  something decisive has happened. Thus, the current GATT  regulations have to a large extent provided the possibility of  taking into account environmental protection aspects within the  framework of GATT basic principles.  <H5>  A Whole Series of Open Questions </H5>   Existing possibilities for using GATT for environmental  protections have been further enhanced, extended, and bolstered  through a whole series of additional measures and legal  settlements contained in the various agreements that were  concluded within the framework of the Uruguay Round, for example:    -- The codex subsidies do not exclude support and assistance  for the promotion of environmental protection. If they satisfy  certain conditions, they cannot be attacked.    -- The treaty on technical trade restrictions sets out a  procedure for determining whether a product or production  process "restricts trade more than is absolutely necessary to  pursue justified interests such as the protection of health,  plant or animal life, or the environment quite simply."    -- Like Article 22 of GATT, the treaty on services also does  not rule out general exceptions such as the protection of the  life and health of people, animals, and plants.    The existing rules, measures, and procedures that are to be  implemented with the Marrakesh signing indicate that there is  growing concern on the part of GATT partners to bring the rules  of international trade and the necessity of preserving the  environment into harmony with each other. To orient trade and  the environment to achieving the GATT preamble principle of the  efficient use of world resources, trade and environmental  regulations should be mutually supportive. This requires that  the prices of the products and services that are traded should  reflect internal and external cost factors.    Trade restrictions tend to distort prices and should not  therefore be a substitute for more efficient direct  environmental measures such as production, product, or  consumption taxes and controls. Liberal trade regulations will  also contribute to improving trade and environmental techniques  and technologies.    However, despite what has been achieved, there are still  things that have to be done in order to achieve the goal of  sustained development in the field of "trade and the  environment" too. Even if the existing GATT agreement and the  additional procedures, measures, and settlements already take  into account environmental considerate in numerous ways or at  least try to, a whole series of questions and aspects still  remains open and has to be dealt with.    The first condition for this is to be created in Marrakesh.  Within the framework of the future world trade organization --  and on an interim basis until it is created -- structural  conditions should be created for dealing with theses issues. A  special agency -- irrespective of how it should be called or  will be called -- staffed by trade and environment experts will  deal with the basic issues.    The following subject areas -- for which basic preparations  have been made in other international organizations such as the  OECD, the UN Environment Program, and the UN Conference on Trade  and Development -- should be addressed by this agency thoroughly  and as quickly as possible:    -- An extensive investigation of those points in trade that  would be affected by the application of environmental measures  with the goal of making the GATT regulations, including Article  22, concrete. This entails that measures stemming from national  environment policies and international environmental treaties,  which intervene in international trade to varying degrees (for  example, voluntary product identification, economic instruments,  and import bans) and vary in their geographical scope (which  means investigating causes and consequences) must be viewed in a  differentiated manner when checked on the basis of the  principles that are to be applied under GATT;  <H5>  Extensive Development </H5>   -- Specific rules and procedures for dealing with so-called  environmental dumping and environmental subsidies;    -- Additional requirements for the notification of trade  measures based on environmental grounds with a view to greater  clarity and to facilitating consultations;    -- The investigation and assessment of environmental  treaties  or other international treaties from the viewpoint of their  relevance for trade, and conversely of trade measures from the  viewpoint of their environmental relevance.    Marrakesh cannot represent an end or even a transitional  stage, but must solely represent a new beginning. It must  represent a new beginning for an intensive dialogue between  trade and environment policies and politicians on national and  international levels with the goal of mutual support for trade  and environment policies and the constant assessment and  checking of such policies on the basis of criteria established  jointly, and this could make a contribution to bringing about  the desired partnership between trade and environment policies  and thus to partnership between international trade and the  environment.    A dialogue that is established in this way is a contribution  to extensive, sustained growth.</p>

Introduction and Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On March 17, 1994 the Cincinnati Stock Exchange, Inc. (``CSE'' or ``Exchange'') filed a proposed rule change with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder. <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  The proposed rule change would require specialists to establish the appropriate functional separation to their operations while maintaining and enforcing written procedures to prevent the misuse of material, non-public information by employee, affiliated individual and proprietary accounts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. &sect;78s(b)(1) (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1992). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Notice of the filing of this proposal appeared in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on June 21, 1994. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  No comment letters were received. For the reasons discussed below, the Commission has determined to approve the proposal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34215, 59 FR 32031 (June 21, 1994). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Description <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The CSE is proposing to require Exchange Designated Dealers (``specialist'') to establish the appropriate functional separation to their operations while maintaining and enforcing written procedures designed to prevent the misuse of material, non-public information by employee, affiliated individual and proprietary accounts. The proposed rule further requires that a copy of such procedures be provided to the Exchange for review and approval, and sets forth specific guidelines for designated dealers to follow in adopting, maintaining and enforcing Chinese Wall procedures. Finally, the proposal requires that the Exchange specialist firm obtain prior <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  written approval of the Exchange that it has complied with the requirements in establishing functional separation as appropriate to the operation and that it has established proper compliance and audit procedures to ensure the maintenance of the functional separation. <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Current Exchange members will be given a 90 day grace period to come into compliance. Thereafter, as well as for now applicants during such 90 day period, compliance must be demonstrated to the Exchange before the applicant firm may function as a specialist on the Exchange. Conversation between Robert P. Ackermann, Secretary and Vice President Regulatory Services, Cincinnati Stock Exchange, and Jill W. Ostergaard, Attorney, Office of Market Supervision, Division of Market Regulation, Commission on July 12, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> In addition, a copy of these Chinese Wall procedures, and any amendments thereto, must be filed with the Exchange Surveillance Department. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposal identifies certain minimum procedural and maintenance requirements. First, the associated or affiliated person can have no influence on specific specialist trading decisions. Second, material, non-public corporate or market information obtained by the associated or affiliated person from the issuer may not be made available to the specialist. Third, clearing and margin financing information regarding the specialist may be routed only to employees engaged in overseeing operations of the affiliated or associated persons and specialist entities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the proposal places limitations on the information which may pass between a broker affiliated with an associated or affiliated person and the specialist, such that they are limited to that exchange of information which would occur in the normal course of his trading and ``market probing'' activity. The specialist may divulge to such an affiliated broker information regarding market conditions in speciality stocks that he would make available in the normal course of specializing to any other broker, and in the same manner. The proposal permits an affiliated or associated person to ``popularize'' <FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>  a specialty stock provided it makes adequate disclosure about the existence of possible conflicts of interest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> ``Popularizing'' generally refers to the practice by specialists, their member organizations and their corporate parents, of making recommendations and providing research coverage regarding their speciality securities.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Securities Exchange Act Release No. 23768, 51 FR 41183 (November 13, 1986) (``NYSE/Amex Order''). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposal, moreover, provides specific procedures that will apply if a specialist becomes privy to material, non-public information. In such a case, the specialist must promptly inform his firm's compliance officer, or other designated official, of the communication and seek guidance from the officer or official as to what procedures he should follow or what other action should subsequently be followed. The compliance officer or official must maintain appropriate records, including a summary of the information received by the specialist and a description of the action taken by the compliance officer or other official. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, the Exchange has established certain procedures to monitor compliance, including the examination of the Chinese Wall procedures established by the Exchange specialist firms and surveillance of proprietary trades effected by an affiliated or associated person and its affiliated or associated specialist firm. The Exchange will also monitor the trading activities of affiliated or associated persons and affiliated or associated specialist in the specialist firms' speciality stocks in order to monitor the possible trading while in possession of material, nonpublic information through the periodic review of trade and comparisons reports generated by the Exchange. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / Unions poised for more rail action MORE disruption on the railways can be expected next week. The executive of the Rail, Maritime and Transport Union meets today to decide on its next move following last Friday's 24-hour stoppage on the railway network. Unless British Rail guarantees no future compulsory redundancies, RMT looks set to call another one-day strike, perhaps in mid-week. Tomorrow, the train drivers' union Aslef will announce the result of a strike ballot. Its leaders are confident of backing for a 24-hour stoppage. RMT members at Sealink Stena ferries are also expected to join strike action at ports while workers in the railway workshops are likely to join in the next 24-hour stoppage. The National Union of Mineworkers and London bus workers could also be involved in further stoppages. None of the unions can hold 24-hour stoppages indefinitely. By law they have to hold further strike ballots within 28 days of their last ballots.</p>

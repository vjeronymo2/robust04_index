			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Proclamation signed by Pavol Hagyari, chairman of the KDS, </F> and Anton Duris, chairman of the DS: "A Statement Concerning the  Merger of DS and KDS"]    [Text] The parliamentary elections of 1992 have clearly  demonstrated that the setback suffered by the Slovak civic right  was primarily the result of its fragmentation. As a result of  its inability to form a preelection coalition, more than 10  percent of voters today have no representative in the Slovak  parliament capable of promoting their political interests.  Having learned from this experience and, in accordance with the  will of our voting membership, having resolved to continue the  process of integration of the Slovak civic right, the  Conservative Democratic Party [KDS] and the Democratic Party  [DS] have concluded a merger agreement.    This new political entity intends to resume the traditions  of  the DS, which succeeded in concentrating all of the civic forces  that opposed fascism and, after the liberation [of 1945], fought  for the reestablishment of parliamentary democracy, a  law-governed state, and the protection of private property and  private enterprise. At that time, the DS demonstrated that it  could successfully defend these values in Slovakia while  struggling against communist expansionism, aggressive  proletarian dictatorship, and totalitarianism.    We will strive to renew, advance, and preserve democratic  values, and to create a civic society that will promote the free  development of individual citizens. We are convinced that only  a principled transformation of society and the economy will  enable Slovakia to join the community of democratic and  prosperous countries.</p>

			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / Union levy move rejected THE GOVERNMENT has decided against introducing proposals which would require trade unions to obtain regular permission from members on contributing to a political fund. The move would have seriously depleted Labour party resources. However, an employment bill expected this week is expected to include Conservative manifesto pledges to give the public the right to take legal action against illegal strikes and individuals greater freedom over which union they join. It also seems certain to require unions to obtain the written permission of members every three years before asking employers to deduct subscriptions at source. That is expected to reduce union funds significantly. However, Mr Michael Forsyth, the employment minister, has decided against introducing a similar clause on the political levy which is used for union contributions to the Labour party. The government is undecided whether to include changes to maternity pay entitlements. The Conservatives are committed to European Community proposals that would give all employed women, regardless of length of service, the right to 14 weeks maternity leave on levels equivalent at least to sick pay, and to the right to return to their job within six months. The proposals would also make it illegal to dismiss any worker for reasons connected with pregnancy. However, the government may want to delay legal implementation after the failure of EC employment ministers to agree the proposals last week. Under this week's legislation, the Department of Employment plans to appoint a commissioner to help the public sue unions that mount unlawful strikes anywhere in the private and public sectors. The bill is also understood to include a seven-day 'cooling-off' period between unions calling strikes and taking action. It is expected to include proposals for strike ballots to be conducted by post and subjected to independent scrutiny and the introduction of strengthened rights of union members against fraud in elections and mismanagement of finances.</p>

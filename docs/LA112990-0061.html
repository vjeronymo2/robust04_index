			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> D.A. DECIDES NOT TO CHARGE ROB PILATUS OF MILLI VANILLI  </P> <P> Citing insufficient evidence, prosecutors refused to file sexual battery  charges Wednesday against Rob Pilatus of the lip-syncing, scandal-ridden pop  duo Milli Vanilli.  </P> <P> "It's not that I question her credibility," Deputy Dist. Atty. Lynn Reed said  after interviewing the 25-year-old woman involved. "But the conduct described  did not rise to the level of a sexual assault or battery that we could  successfully prosecute."  </P> <P> Under state law, sexual battery is the touching of a person's private parts  while he or she is restrained, against his or her will, for sexual arousal,  excluding rape. Reed declined to specify what the woman claimed Pilatus had  done, but his attorney said no bondage was alleged.  </P> <P> The woman, whose name was not released, had met Pilatus on Monday night at the  China Club, a Hollywood nightspot, and later went home with the star, his  partner and another friend. The couple were "moving toward a romantic encounter  of some sort," said Mike Botula, a spokesman for the district attorney's  office, when the woman decided to leave.  </P> <P> Pilatus, 24, was arrested just before dawn Tuesday when Los Angeles police  responded to a 911 emergency telephone call from a taxi dispatcher who heard  arguing and shouting in the background when someone at the pop star's Bel-Air  home called for a cab.  </P> <P> He was released later that day after posting $10,000 bail and paying nearly  $500 for outstanding traffic violations.  </P> <P> "There was 'probable cause' for arresting him on suspicion of a felony based on  what the woman told the officer," said Lt. Ron Hall, commanding officer of the  West Los Angeles detectives unit. "But the district attorney felt there was not  enough evidence to get a conviction. It was a one-on-one situation, with no  corroborating evidence."  </P> <P> Hall said it is unlikely the case will be referred to the city attorney for  prosecution as a misdemeanor.  </P> <P> "This is not his month," said Pilatus' attorney, Erroll Stambler. He was  referring to Pilatus being stripped of the 1989 Grammy Award won with partner  Fab Morvan for the best-selling album "Girl You Know It's True," after the two  admitted that they had not sung a note on the album or at any of their "live"  performances.  </P> <P> It turns out that they also misled fans with their catchy name: Milli Vanilli  doesn't mean "positive energy" -- or anything -- in Turkish, as they had once  claimed.  </P> <P> "It's unfortunate for him, with the recent publicity, that this has come  about," Stambler said. "He's not at fault. He has done absolutely nothing  wrong."  </P> <P> Milli Vanilli Question  </P> <P> Are the lip-syncers an example of technology gone wild or the pioneers of a new  era?

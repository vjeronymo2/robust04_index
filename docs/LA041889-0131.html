			<p><P> April 18, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HIGHLIGHTS OF TODAY'S AFI/LA FILM FESTIVAL  </P> <P> Following are capsule reviews of today's screenings in the American Film  Institute Los Angeles International Film Festival at the Cineplex Odeon Century  Plaza Cinemas:  </P> <P> 'La Gran Fiesta'  </P> <P> Puerto Rico, 1986, 100 minutes  </P> <P> 7:15 p.m.  </P> <P>  San Juan's most prestigious casino and social club is the site of a last grand  ball before it is converted into a U.S. military facility for the duration of  World War II. Francoites and liberals dance and mingle and, under the  glittering surface, intrigues, double-crosses, and heartbreaks percolate and  pop. This first film by Marcos Zurinaga ("Tango Bar") is a lesser effort.  Zurinaga skimps on his specialties -- musical numbers and eye and body english  -- and, though we need a Fitzgeraldian bittersweet opulence, gives us something  drier, thinner, more like Edna Ferber.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As another way of harmonizing the CARB LEV program and the CFF program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to ensure a sufficient number of HDDEs will be available by 1998 for the fleet  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program, EPA will only test engine families which were certified to CFV standards on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> California diesel fuel on diesel fuel meeting California specifications during any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Selective Enforcement Audit (SEA) testing or in-use recall enforcement testing. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agency believes that if manufacturers of HD CFVs certified on California fuel perceive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that their engines may be subject to later EPA testing on federal diesel fuel, then they  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may desire to perform additional testing of these engines on federal certification diesel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fuel for the purpose of assuring themselves of in-use compliance on federal diesel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fuel. This approach to SEA and in-use recall testing should assure manufacturers that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> they will not need to perform any additional testing at certification beyond that required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for California certification. Fuel meeting California diesel test fuel specifications is an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acceptable test fuel under the FTP because it meets the federal fuel specifications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This policy of the Agency using fuel meeting California diesel test fuel specifications  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for SEA and recall testing applies only to CFVs. If the Agency becomes aware of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changed circumstances which indicate that this policy is inappropriate, the Agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reserves the right to discontinue this policy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For gasoline-fueled HD CFVs, EPA is aware of no evidence to suggest any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant difference in emissions between such vehicles operating on federal and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> California certification gasolines; thus the technical basis for separate standards which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exists for diesels does not apply for gasoline engines. Commenters did not respond  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the issue of the appropriateness of a single standard for all HDEs. However, EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believes that in general, a single standard for all fuels provides equity among  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturers of different types of engines for this program. Also, section 245 of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act seems to indicate that Congress intended for there to be a single heavy-duty CFV  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard. Therefore, as for diesel engines, EPA today also promulgates a standard of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.8 g/Bhp-hr for gasoline clean-fuel vehicle engines certified on federal gasoline test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fuel. As with diesel engines, gasoline engines demonstrating compliance with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> California 3.5 g/Bhp-hr standard on California gasoline certification fuel will be eligible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for a federal certificate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Given the arguments above, as well as the fact that manufacturers have more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than three years before the purchase requirements for clean-fuel fleet vehicles begin,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA believes that several heavy-duty diesel engine families will achieve a standard of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.8 g/Bhp-hr NMHC + NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on federal certification fuel or 3.5 g/Bhp-hr NMHC + NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on California certification fuel by the 1998 model year. Also, EPA believes that most  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gasoline-fueled HDE families can meet a standard of either 3.8 g/Bhp-hr on federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certification fuel or 3.5 g/Bhp-hr on California fuel by the 1998 model year. These  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clean fuel vehicle standards will apply to HDEs used in clean-fuel fleet vehicles of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8,501 to 26,000 lbs. GVWR to meet the purchase requirements of the fleet program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> b. Heavy-Duty ULEV and ZEV Standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As previously discussed, section 246(f)(4) of the CAA requires EPA to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> promulgate emission standards for ULEVs and ZEVs, for the purpose of determining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fleet program credits. The provision states that the standards:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> *&blank;*&blank;*&blank;shall be more stringent than those otherwise applicable to clean-fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles under this part*&blank;*&blank;*&blank;. The standards*&blank;*&blank;*for [light-duty] vehicles*&blank;*&blank;*shall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conform as closely as possible to standards which are established by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State of California for ULEV and ZEV vehicles in the same class. For  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles of 8,500 lbs. GVWR or more, the Administrator shall promulgate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comparable standards for purposes of this subsection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA interprets this comparability criteria to mean that ULEV and ZEV standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for heavy-duty engines should require approximately the same percentage of emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduction compared to heavy-duty CFV LEV standards as light-duty CFV ULEV and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ZEV standards require compared to light-duty CFV LEV standards. Under this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provision, EPA must determine the appropriate level for the heavy-duty ULEV and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ZEV standards. EPA proposed this interpretation and did not receive any comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> objecting to it.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA also believes it is appropriate to take California's ULEV and ZEV  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards into consideration and attempt to harmonize the federal and California  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards where possible. As mentioned above in the section pertaining to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> feasibility of the HD CFV LEV standard, EPA believes such harmonization is valuable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because it helps create a single larger market for heavy-duty ULEVs and ZEVs rather  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than two smaller markets. A single larger market makes it more economical for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturers to produce heavy-duty ULEVS and ZEVs, which makes it more likely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that manufacturers will choose to produce vehicles that can participate in the federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program. (The federal program does not have a sales mandate for manufacturers, so  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their participation is voluntary and controlled, in part, by market demand for their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> June 2, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> COUNSELED MCMARTIN CASE DEFENDANT;  </P> <P> MINISTER DENIES HEARING OF MOLESTATION  </P> <P> A Redondo Beach minister who in the early 1980s counseled McMartin Pre-School  defendants Raymond Buckey and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, testified  Thursday that the sessions had nothing to do with child molestation.  </P> <P> "I never discussed with Raymond Buckey sexual problems with children," said Dr.  Frank Richelieu, who described himself as pastor of the Church of Religious  Science, a metaphysical and motivational denomination, and a licensed  practitioner of prayer treatment.  </P> <P> Instead, he testified outside the presence of the jury, "I've seen Raymond on  general matters regarding his direction in life, his self-image and self-worth,  and at one time Raymond was going through a drinking experience."  </P> <P> The clergyman said Peggy McMartin Buckey, who was already in counseling, had  asked if he would see her son "and try to talk with him regarding the direction  in his life, what he would like to do . . . not any emotional problems."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Counseling Sessions  </P> <P> Richelieu was subpoenaed by prosecutors, who maintain that the counseling  sessions focused on what they say was Raymond Buckey's sexual attraction to  young children. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge William Pounders said he would  reserve a ruling on whether the counseling sessions are protected by  confidentiality laws until court resumes next Thursday, after a scheduled  break, or whether they may be discussed in front of the jury.  </P> <P> Tempers flared both inside and outside the courtroom Thursday as each side  attacked the other, and the judge at one point admonished the pastor to "calm  down."  </P> <P> In court, Richelieu said there was "not a word of truth" in a statement by  Deputy Dist. Atty. Lael Rubin that entries in Virginia McMartin's diaries  referring to her grandson's "problem" was a reference to his alleged sexual  proclivity toward children. The prosecutor's comment was contained in a 1987  Times article.  </P> <P> Asked afterward whether she had some basis two years ago for believing that a  sexual problem with young children was the subject of that counseling and  whether she had changed her mind, Rubin said: "I had a basis then, and as of  about an hour ago rechecked the basis of my statement, and my response is still  the same." She said she could not reveal the basis for her belief "because it  hasn't been presented yet."  </P> <P> Asked if she believes that Richelieu is lying, Rubin said, "What I'm suggesting  is that he may have other motivations."  </P> <P> Defense attorney Dean Gits, who represents Peggy McMartin Buckey, maintained  that "all of the evidence that is now before the court demonstrates that Dr.  Richelieu never counseled Ray Buckey for anything to do even remotely with  child molestation."  </P> <P> Lawyer Danny Davis, who represents Raymond Buckey, told reporters, "I agree  with Richelieu," and added that Rubin "is a liar."  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Written Rules  </P> <P> Richelieu said that while his church has no written rules about divulging what  happens during counseling sessions, he was trained to respect the confidences  entrusted to him by the Buckeys and others. The defense is seeking to block  more detailed questions about the content of those sessions.  </P> <P> During cross-examination of Peggy McMartin Buckey, which resumed late Thursday,  the judge has allowed testimony about Raymond Buckey's alcohol and drug  problems, his discomfort with peers and adults and preference for the company  of children, and a neighbor's account of Raymond's loud arguments with his  parents.  </P> <P> "Mrs. Buckey has painted the school and her conduct there in a particular way,"  he explained to the attorneys, adding that "this tends to seriously cast" that  in doubt. "If the descriptions here are correct, Raymond Buckey had a lot of  problems that should have caused him to be removed from the preschool, aside  from molesting children."  </P> <P> The Buckeys, now in their third year of trial, are charged with 65 counts of  molestation and conspiracy involving 11 children who attended their Manhattan  Beach nursery school.  </P></p>

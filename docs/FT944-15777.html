			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Arts: Today's Television Imagine the planning meeting for today's Channel 4 documentary: 'We want to do an elephant-on-the-floor documentary series'. 'What's that?' 'It's like a fly-on-the-wall series, but you tell the truth about the effect of having a camera crew around'. 'I'd stick to fly-on-the-wall if I were you. What's your subject?' 'The police'. 'You're joking, people have been making documentaries about the police since before the birth of Christ. Why not pastry cooks or lighthouse keepers?' 'They don't work in the nick and nick people'. 'No. Point taken. What are you going to call it?' The Nick. (9.00). Cardboard played a big part in last week's Scrimpers. One old lady showed how to extend your chair arms with loo roll inners, and an undertaker displayed his cardboard coffin. It still cost 49.95, but what a sound idea (8.00 C4). In The Shakespeare Laboratory members of the RSC work on Measure For Measure (8.00 BBC2). World In Action is about road accidents caused by tranquillisers and other drugs over-prescribed by doctors (8.30 ITV).</p>

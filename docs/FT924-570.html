			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / International Company News: GM considers extending its alliance with Toyota GENERAL Motors of the US and Toyota of Japan are believed to be discussing an extension of their existing alliance, which manufactures cars at a plant in California. The expansion might include the use of an idled GM factory to produce Toyota vehicles. Since 1984, GM and Toyota have had a 50-50 joint venture in California, called New United Motor Manufacturing Inc (Nummi), which is managed by the Japanese company and builds cars sold by each company under its own name. A Japanese newspaper report, denied by Toyota, said GM had now asked Toyota to use one of GM's idled US factories to build Toyota's new mid-size T100 pick-up truck. The T100 has caused a ripple of anxiety among Detroit manufacturers, who currently have the US market for large pick-up trucks to themselves. But GM issued a more positive statement, declaring that the Nummi joint venture provided a 'foundation for further co-operation'. It added: 'Certainly, the utilisation of idled facilities in the US presents a potential area for discussion.' GM said it was monitoring initial US market reaction to the T-100 and remained committed to defending its number one position in full-sized trucks. It would vigorously compete with all competitors. But analysts said an expanded alliance could benefit both companies. By manufacturing at a GM plant in the US, Toyota would get round a 25 per cent tariff on imported trucks and avoid the cost of building a new factory at a time of financial stringency. Co-operation with financially-troubled GM to keep an idled plant open would help Toyota lessen protectionist sentiment in Washington. GM, struggling to turn its lossmaking North American operations to profitability, would save money on labour costs, since under an agreement with the United Auto Workers union it is obliged to pay laid-off workers virtually full pay indefinitely. The Toyota truck would also occupy a market area where GM does not have a model.</p>

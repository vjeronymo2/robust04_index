Allegations of the Staff <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 5. In 1988, S&amp;D imported approximately 698,000 ``Santa Bear'' stuffed toy animals from China. The toys are subject to, but some failed to comply with, the Commission's Small Parts Regulation, 16 CFR part 1501, in that when tested by the staff in 1990 under 16 CFR 1500.52, (a) one or more parts of some of the tested toys separated and (b) one or more of the parts that separated from the tested toys fit completely within the test cylinder, as set forth in 16 CFR 1501.4. Accordingly, some of the Santa Bears present a ``mechanical hazard'' within the meaning of section 2(s) of the FHSA, 15 U.S.C. 1261(s).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Most of the Santa Bears identified in paragraph 5 above were sold to the public by Raffoler, Ltd., a mail order business that is owned by Jerry Williams and Stephen Brown and is located at the same address as S&amp;D. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Some of the Santa Bears identified in paragraph 5 above are a ``hazardous substance'' pursuant to section 2(f)(1)(D) of the FHSA, 15 U.S.C. 1261(f)(1)(D). Some of the Santa Bears identified in paragraph 5 above are also a ``banned hazardous substance'' pursuant to section 2(q)(1)(A) of the FHSA, 15 U.S.C. &sect;1261(q)(1)(A); and 16 CFR 1500.18(a)(9). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. On November 7, 1990, the staff sent a certified letter to S&amp;D advising the firm that the Santa Bear contains small parts and is considered to be a banned hazardous substance. Notice was provided that continued sale of the product is prohibited by section 4 of the FHSA, 15 U.S.C. 1263, and is punishable by penalties described in section 5 of the Act, 15 U.S.C. &sect;1264. At this time, S&amp;D had an unsold inventory of approximately 110,000 Santa Bears. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. On November 15, 1990, S&amp;D attempted to return its inventory of Santa Bears to the import agent from whom S&amp;D had purchasedthe goods. On November 20, 1990, the import agent advised S&amp;D that it would not accept return of the Santa Bears. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. In or around early December 1990, an employee of S&amp;D asked a third party to attempt to find prospective purchasers of the Santa Bears. The third party found a prospective purchaser and so advised the employee of S&amp;D. The sale of the Santa Bears was consummated and S&amp;D received proceeds from the sale in the form of credit from the import agent for goods previously purchased and for goods to be purchased in the future. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11. After receipt of the certified letter of November 7, 1990, from the staff, as described in paragraph 8 above, S&amp;D knowingly caused the introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of its remaining inventory of approximately 110,000 Santa Bears, in violation of section 4(a) of the FHSA, 15 U.S.C. 1263(a), and for which a civil penalty may be improved pursuant to section 5(c) of the FHSA, 15 U.S.C. 1264(c). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Response of S&amp;D Importing Co. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 12. S&amp;D denies the allegations of the staff set forth in paragraphs 5 through 11 above, including the allegations that it has knowingly caused the introduction into commerce of the aforesaid banned hazardous toys and that it has violated the FHSA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Many commenters opposed requiring a third-party servicer to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assume joint and several liability with an institution for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> violation by the servicer of a Title IV, HEA program requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These commenters argued that to impose joint and several  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> liability on a third-party servicer would (1) lead to increased  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicing fees to compensate for increased risk assumed by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicer; (2) force out servicers not willing to assume a level  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of risk in excess of the servicer's fees and compensation; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) interfere in contractual matters that should be left to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> parties involved. These commenters recommended that instead of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> imposing liability on a third-party servicer, to increase  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accountability of the administration of the Title IV, HEA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs, the Secretary should instead focus on an institution's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative capability and financial responsibility to achieve  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> greater accountability.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters questioned what happens to existing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contracts with institutions that were negotiated under a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> different assumption of liability. A few of these commenters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> asked the Secretary not to impose retroactive liability for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contracts that did not incorporate or price for such an event.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretary appreciates the support from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters who agreed that third-party servicers should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> jointly and severally liable with an institution with which the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicer contracts for any violation by the servicer of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Title IV, HEA program requirement. The Secretary agrees with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these commenters that third-party servicer liability is necessary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to insure compliance with Title IV, HEA program requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Servicers who must stand behind their work financially are more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> likely to use the high standard of care expected of Title IV, HEA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program participants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary has reexamined his position with regard to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adopting the compromise in the NPRM to limit joint and several  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> liability to the fees and compensation that a third-party  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicer has received from the institution if the servicer was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not an affiliate of the institution. The Secretary does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believe that anything less than the full assumption of liability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> can fully protect the interest of Federal tax dollars in the form  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of Title IV, HEA program assistance. Otherwise, servicers have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> no financial incentive to insure complete program compliance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to the comment that a third-party servicer should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not be assessed liability unless it can be proven that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicer is at fault, the Secretary does not consider a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> third-party servicer to be jointly and severally liable with an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution unless the servicer is the one that has violated a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Title IV, HEA program requirement. The Secretary believes that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> if a third-party servicer violates a Title IV, HEA program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement that the servicer should be held liable, along with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the institution with which the servicer contracts, because a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> violation, even an error, impacts on the integrity of the Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> student financial assistance programs, and should be redressed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary disagrees with the comments that requiring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicer liability will necessarily increase fees so as to deny  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> access to servicing. Some of these commenters noted that some  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicers may price their service at a low-level to reflect the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fact that they assume no liability. The Secretary does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believe that institutions or federal taxpayers are well served by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicers who are unwilling to stand behind the quality of their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> work. As agents of institutions participating in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Title IV, HEA programs, servicers are also subject to an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's fiduciary responsibility to use the highest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard of care and diligence. By rejecting any responsibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the quality of its work, the Secretary believes any such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicer cannot be expected to perform with the required concern  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the proper expenditure of federal funds. The Secretary notes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that he received favorable comments from organizations that are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> third-party servicers, or institutions who utilize third-party  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicers, who did not raise any issue of adverse impact on fees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary has no doubt that these and similar servicers will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continue to compete effectively for institutional clients at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> competitive prices. The Secretary notes that the higher  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> education servicing industry is highly competitive which should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> restrain any excessive fee increases; in fact, by requiring all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicers to assume liability, the Secretary believes that this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement should level the playing field by eliminating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> underbidding by those servicers who assume no responsibility for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the quality of their work.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary notes that servicers are not being asked to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> serve as guarantors for their client-institutions, but merely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> being required to answer for the consequences of their own  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conduct. In this regard, if the services they provide have no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adverse financial impact, there is no financial exposure for such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a third-party servicer, or reason to increase fees charged.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to those commenters who contended that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> liability provision interfered in contractual matters that should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be left up to the parties involved, the Secretary disagrees. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary strongly believes that it is necessary to include this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provision in the regulations because a third-party servicer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administers aspects of the Title IV, HEA programs that are funded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with Federal tax dollars. Therefore, it is entirely appropriate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to establish requirements to safeguard such funds. Simply  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> leaving this area to the parties, leaves open that possibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that no minimal care will be exercised by the servicer. An  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution is free, however, under these regulations to agree to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indemnify a third-party servicer in the event a third-party  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicer must make any payment to the Secretary. The Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notes that these regulations will have the salutary effect of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requiring institutions and servicers to exercise greater care in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the selection of their contractual partners.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary would like to make clear that a third-party  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicer and an institution are only jointly and severally liable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for any violations of any statutory or regulatory provision  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicable to Title IV of the HEA and not for other types of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> violations. The Secretary is imposing requirements in contracts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> between third-party servicers and institutions only to the extent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that a third-party servicer or institution administers any aspect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the Title IV, HEA programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to the commenters who asked about the impact on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existing contracts, the Secretary states that third-party  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicers will have no joint and several liability for periods  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prior to the effective date of these regulations. The Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expects that once these regulations become effective, all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contracts between third-party servicers and institutions will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have to include the requirements provided in &sect;668.25(c),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including the requirement that a third-party servicer is jointly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and severally liable with the institution for any violation by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the servicer of any statutory provision of or applicable to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Title IV of the HEA, any regulatory prescribed under that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statutory authority, and any applicable special arrangements,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agreements, and limitations entered into under the authority of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statutes pertaining to Title IV of the HEA. This may require  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modification of existing contracts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Some of the commenters questioned the provisions of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this section governing a third-party servicer's responsibility to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> report all suspected instances of fraud to the Department of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Education's Office of Inspector General. Two of these commenters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommended that in order to meet this requirement that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> third-party servicers be given an unqualified privilege exempting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the servicer from any liability in connection with the referral  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of an institution to the Department of Education's Office of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Inspector General. In addition, one of the commenter questioned  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Secretary's requirement to refer suspected instances of fraud  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or other criminal misconduct in connection with the Title IV, HEA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs. The commenter was concerned that if the servicer was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wrong that the servicer's reputation would be irrevocably  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> damaged. One commenter suggested that a third-party servicer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should only be required to report information indicating fraud  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only where there is proof to substantiate the belief that an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution may have engaged in fraud.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretary recognizes that third-party servicers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will not always be privy to sufficient information to identify  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possible fraud or criminal misconduct on the part of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution. However, if there are identifiable circumstances in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which a reasonable person would believe that an institution has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deliberately misreported information, recklessly reported  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information without regard for its accuracy, or altered official  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> documents, then a third-party servicer should report such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information to the Office of Inspector General. The servicer is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not required to reach a firm conclusion as to the impropriety of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the institution's actions or provide evidence to substantiate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possible criminal charges, but is required to simply refer the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> matter to the Department of Education's Office of Inspector  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> General for appropriate action. Since this referral requirement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is a required part of any contract between a third-party servicer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and an institution, an institution has no basis to object to any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> referral made pursuant to this requirement. The Secretary thus  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believes that it is unnecessary to provide an unqualified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> privilege as suggested by some commenters; moreover, such a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> privilege would allow referrals even where there is no reasonable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> basis to believe misconduct has occurred. The Secretary assures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> third-party servicers that a third-party servicer will not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> held responsible for any violations that the servicer has not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> itself perpetrated or aided and abetted. However, the Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will regard failure to take appropriate action when there is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasonable cause to believe that fraud or criminal misconduct has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occurred to be a serious violation of these regulations and of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participant's fiduciary obligations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter supported the concept of the provision  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in this section governing the requirement that an institution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must notify the Secretary within 10 days of the date that a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contract between an institution or third-party servicer is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modified or terminated or within 10 days of the date that a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> third-party servicer, under contract with that institution, goes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> out of business, stops providing services, or files a petition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for bankruptcy. However, the commenter believed that the burden  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of notifying the Secretary of any changes to the contract should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rest with the servicer. Many commenters opposed this provision  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and argued that this requirement constituted needless paperwork  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the part of the institution. These commenters contended that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any changes to a contract between a third-party servicer would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> examined in the course of having performed an annual audit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / Japan's Mr Talkman: Akio Morito, chairman of Sony, outlines his views to Charles Leadbeater Mr Akio Morita, the chairman of Sony, stood on the trading floor of a Wall Street stockbroking company, filled with bright young men watching computer screens displaying flickering share prices. He turned to one of them and posed his question about the nature of American capitalism: 'How far ahead do you look when you make decisions?' The young man shrugged: 'Ten minutes.' The revelation shook the questioner: 'It was a big shock for me because usually we look 10 years ahead.' What the stockbroker's remark revealed - however facetiously - was the extent of the clash between the cultures and values of Japanese and American capitalism. It is a conflict that increasingly preoccupies Mr Morita, Sony's co-founder. He has good reason to be concerned that relations between Japan and America are becoming more strained and distant. Sony's business depends upon a cultural bridge between the two countries. The consumer electronic hardware for which Sony is famous - stereo systems, tape recorders, video-cassette players, televisions - largely entertain people by playing American films, programmes and music made in the US: entertainment software, in the industry jargon. Sony's financial power is founded upon the success of its manufacturing base in Japan. This has funded its recent acquisitions in the US entertainment software business, most notably the Dollars 6.5bn it paid for Columbia Pictures in 1989 and the Dollars 2bn acquisition of CBS records the year before. By buying these businesses, Sony is seeking control over both software and hardware. As the company stands on legs spread between Japan and the US, it is not suprising that Mr Morita believes it imperative that trade conflict should not pull them apart. The career of the 70-year-old Mr Morita was in part devoted to increasing exports of consumer electronics, the very products that have come to form a large part of the trade surplus which trading partners complain so loudly about. Now in the twilight of his career, he sees his role as soothing the tensions generated by the surplus. Mr Morita founded the Tokyo Telecommunications Engineering Corporation with his partner, Mr Masaru Ibuka, in 1946, two years after graduating from Osaka Imperial University's physics department. The company's name was changed to Sony in 1958. He is widely admired by fellow engineers and senior executives in the west and Japan for his combination of technological prowess and business acumen. He has turned the company into a multinational group with 1990 sales of Y2,880bn (Pounds 12.6bn) and pre-tax profits of Y267bn. His ingenuity in inventing the Walkman portable personal cassette player has made him a more public figure than almost any other Japanese industrialist. A glint in his shiny blue eyes marks his passion for bright ideas and unconventional thinking. But that is only one side of him. He can also fix people with the steely gaze of a highly determined and driven individual. In the west he is widely acknowledged as the epitome of Japanese business success. Inside Japan, however, he is more often seen as a maverick, a self-appointed apostle of radical reform in debates about Japan's future economic and political role in the world, a subject most executives discreetly steer clear of. He entered the fray last month with a controversial article in the Bungei Shunju, the monthly business and cultural magazine which called on Japan to 're-invent itself to blend with the prevailing attitudes and practices of international business', or face mounting attacks from the US and Europe for being closed to foreign competition. Mr Morita believes that government agreements to manage trade frictions do not attack the heart of the issue. What will resolve tension in the long run is a deeper cultural reconciliation of the values and customs of Japan, Europe and the US, particularly in their attitudes towards work. Mr Morita's idea is what he calls a long-term harmonisation of social structures and customs to establish a fair basis for international competition. He explained: 'Japan must change. We are doing business all over the world, society is becoming borderless. The concept of competition must be considered in that light. The social costs of Japanese companies might be less than those US and European companies pay. It may be that difference which makes it difficult for them to compete. So in the long run we have to harmonise social conditions.' Over time, Mr Morita says, Japan should develop some of the characteristics of the European and US economies: instead of wealth accumulating in the hands of companies, more of it should pass into the hands of workers and consumers in the form of longer holidays, better pay, a shorter working life, a better environment and quality of life, particularly improved housing. That adjustment will be needed in the long run if Japan is to overcome with the foreign perception that its economy's competitiveness is based upon delivering poor rewards to workers who nevertheless give unswerving loyalty to their employers. Though he does not say it outright, Mr Morita hints that he believes Japan would be competitive even were it to adopt western approaches to work. For Mr Morita believes Europe and the US have to change a lot, too. His implication is that they are still too slow to learn from what has made Japanese companies successful. Western companies pay top management far too much and those executives often have the wrong attitudes. 'Top management must regard employees as humans not tools,' he says. Indeed, he suggests that many of the difficulties of western companies stem from the shortcomings of senior executives. Although he found his experience on the Wall Street trading floor shocking, he does not accept that short-termism is simply the fault of financiers. Companies are also to blame, he says. He explains how he coped as a fledgeling entrepreneur in the late 1940s, seeking finance to become the first Japanese producer of the tape recorder. 'We had already spent too much money. Our financial officer said we should not spend more money. So we got the engineer running our manufacturing plant, and bought the financial officer dinner, with a lot of beer. The head of manufacturing convinced him the idea seemed promising. That is the first step, to persaude financiers that production plans are realistic. 'If your industry wants to rebuild its strength I hope that top management will pay great attention to persauding the financiers and banks to be patient.' While Mr Morita believes Japan should rethink aspects of its work culture, he does not believe Sony's business strategy is in need of a similarly far-reaching reassessment, despite the sense that growth is slowing in the consumer electronics industry. Sony's pre-tax profits fell by 25.7 per cent in the six months to last September and it warned that business conditions in the second half would be even more severe. Along with its competitors, Sony is pumping huge sums into new products, such as high-definition television, which are still a long way from earning adequate returns. Mr Ken Iwaki, Sony's deputy president for corporate strategy, recently warned the company would have to cut capital spending as the first half of the decade would be marked by unstable, slower growth its largest markets. Mr Morita faces down this gloom with a bullish account of the outlook. 'Consumer electronics will continue to grow because we have many, many new applications of electronic technology for consumers, not just for entertainment but for household uses and in communications.' He is confident on several fronts. The technology inside consumer products will become increasingly sophisticated to make them easier to use, he says. Simple devices like video recorders and televisions already contain small computers which control them. Those computers will become increasingly powerful, making the products they run ever more flexible and intelligent. People will be increasingly using computers without realising it because they will not look like computers. Computers as such account for very little of Sony's sales. But it has set itself the goal of making 10 per cent of sales from computers in the late 1990s, partly through forging alliances with groups such as Apple Computer, the US personal computer maker. However Mr Morita reacts sharply to any suggestion that Sony is only just entering the computer business: 'We are already deeply involved in computers. Computers are not a separate business, they are integral to consumer electronics. Consumer products run on computers.' The integration of computers and consumer electronics will be matched by the growing integration of software and hardware, he believes. Mr Morita identifies three further factors which should feed the industry's growth - the extension, mobility and interconnection of electronic products. Electronics will spread, to transform products which as yet it has only just touched: notebooks and diaries will be replaced by small computers, while ordinary kitchen appliances will be controlled by them. Products such as specialised computers will become increasingly consumerised for a mass market. Products will also become increasingly mobile; they will be linked to people rather than places. Mr Morita believes the portable telephone will be an important product for the future. Televisions will not just deliver entertainment, they will become tools of communication as well, he says. This profusion of more mobile products will only be possible if they are connected to one another by an infrastructure of telecommunications and satellite links. The growth of consumer products will rest upon these infrastructures being extended internationally. Mr Morita has been like a powerful micro-processor, pumping away inside his company, turning ideas into technology, technology into products and products into money. But is it now time for a younger generation of management to take over? The response is clipped: 'There will be no changes in our administration this year.' Having called the Japanese to consider working fewer hours, some might suggest he should take a lead by retiring. At that kind of remark the glint in the Morita eye dims and the determined gaze descends.</p>

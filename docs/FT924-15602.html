			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / Sport: New package, same old product - Soccer ENGLISH soccer's top division has a new brand name and a new logo, but just six weeks into the FA Premier League's first season it is clear that the product has not improved. The league has changed the colour of the referees' shirts and added five minutes to half-time, but, for the most part, can offer only the same teams serving the same rubbish. Away from the grounds, television is awash with mediocre football and the back pages of Britain's newspapers are dominated by the squabbles of club chairmen. The chairmen are not arguing about how to play football but about money and power. The greatest irritant is television. Successive rounds of TV contract negotiations have left a legacy of anger, suspicion and resentment. The Premier League has its roots in the TV negotiations of 1988. The biggest clubs threatened to break away and take their ratings with them if the league did not sign the deal with ITV that they favoured. The top clubs won, but remained unhappy about subsidising their poorer brethren. Finally, the rich staged their revolution against the poor last year when the first division broke free of the other three. The medium-sized Premier League clubs believe that the ITV deal worked against them. ITV concentrated on the 'Big Five' clubs which had supported them, bestowing on them the generous 'facilities fees' the deal contained and allowing them to cash in on the exposure gained through perimeter advertising - worth up to Pounds 80,000 for one live game - and generous contracts from sponsors and kit makers eager to share that exposure. Ken Bates, chairman of Chelsea, accuses ITV of having a 'blacklist' of clubs which voted against its offer. Ron Noades, chairman of Crystal Palace, says he used to start each season Pounds 1.5m down on the top clubs. 'I can swallow lower gate receipts and merchandising revenue, but the big clubs were using money to which they had no moral right to fleece us.' In May the Premier League clubs accepted a five-year deal from BSkyB, the satellite broadcaster, with the BBC tagging along. It guaranteed Pounds 200m over five years: Pounds 40m a year for 60 live games on satellite plus highlights on BBC. ITV bid Pounds 30m-a-year for 30 live matches and had indicated it would go higher. 'It was a revenge vote,' says David Dein, vice-chairman of Arsenal. Noades says: 'I wanted a partner. I was not so interested in the best offer.' The contract was cunningly constructed by BSkyB. It guarantees every club live games which bring with them Pounds 60,000 'facilities fees.' But BSkyB's audience is tiny compared with the terrestrial channels. Its sports channel has just over 1m subscribers, its rivals reach 25m homes. The terrestrial channels have hit back with live matches from the old second division and the Italian first. The big clubs are unhappy. Dein says: 'We have got over-exposure of soccer on television. We have gone down a branchline and left the mainline free for others. Football could suffer from over-exposure.' The smaller audiences have hurt perimeter advertising, down to around Pounds 5,000 for a live match, and threatens sponsorship revenue. Perimeter advertising united the dissidents and sponsorship gave them the chance to exact their revenge. In September, eight clubs which had united in the 'Platinum group' to sell perimeter advertising were the only eight to vote against a Pounds 3m sponsorship offer by brewers Bass. Under the Premier League constitution, eight votes are enough to block any proposal. Behind the disputes there is a difference in the vision of the league. Bates says: 'The whole concept of the league was to create an elite away from the candyfloss - a league which would give you strength in depth unparalleled in the rest of the world.' But strength in depth is no good to the top clubs, which want to be able to match Europe's elite: AC Milan and Marseille in the increasingly lucrative and time-consuming European competitions. But these goals are often lost behind the grudges. Parry asks forlornly: 'Why are we talking about stuffing people over several thousand pounds?' 'There are a lot more important things in football than arguing about Bass sponsorship,' says Noades. 'We ought to be talking about the quality of the football.'</p>

			<p><P> December 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE BUTCHER: BEEF TENDERLOIN IS CENTERPIECE OF ELEGANT MEAL  </P> <P> At this time of year newspapers and food magazines are filled with ideas for  marvelous holiday meals large enough to feed a small army of friends and  family. It occurs to me, however, that there is a large and growing number of  us who are not going to be cooking for a crowd. There are also, I'm equally  sure, a large number who -- even during the holidays -- don't want to spend all  day in the kitchen. For those in either category, here is a little easy  elegance for holiday dining.  </P> <P> I think there is no more simple cut of meat in the world to work with than a  piece of beef tenderloin. Even the tenderloin of an old bull would melt in your  mouth, so you don't have to worry about what to buy.  </P> <P> Nor should you worry much about how to cook it. It's hard to go wrong. Simply  grilled or roasted rare beef served with red wine and a few sliced tomatoes  makes a great meal. Tenderloin even makes a delicious dish served raw. It's  called carpaccio. Simply slice beef tenderloin very, very thin, arrange the  slices on a plate and dress them with a good olive oil, a squeeze of lemon, a  grind of coarse black pepper and a grating of Parmesan cheese. A great dish for  a first course.  </P> <P> But for an easy, elegant holiday meal for two or four people, buy a  well-trimmed, two-pound piece of beef tenderloin and stuff it yourself. The  best part of the tenderloin for stuffing is the part the French call the  chateaubriand.  </P> <P> Here are a couple of ways to do it, neither of which should take you more than  30 minutes in the kitchen.  </P> <P> MUSHROOM-ONION STUFFED BEEF TENDERLOIN  </P> <P> 1 1/2 to 2 pounds beef tenderloin  </P> <P> Salt, pepper  </P> <P> 4 to 6 pearl onions  </P> <P> 1/2 cup beef broth  </P> <P> 4 to 6 small button mushrooms  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons butter  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon flour  </P> <P> 1/4 cup red wine  </P> <P> Make horizontal cut in 1 side of tenderloin and flatten out. Be careful not to  cut entirely through meat. Leave about 1-inch hinge. Pound meat to overall  thickness of about 3/4 to 1 inch. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Set  aside.  </P> <P> Peel and parboil pearl onions in beef broth until just tender. Reserve broth.  </P> <P> Cut mushrooms in half or quarters, depending on size, and saute in 1 tablespoon  butter in heavy skillet until just tender. Place onions and mushrooms at 1 end  of beef so when rolled up, stuffing will be in center. Roll up jelly-roll  fashion and tie with string at about 1-inch intervals.  </P> <P> Add remaining butter to same skillet in which mushrooms were sauteed and brown  meat well on all sides. Transfer to roasting pan and roast at 475 degrees 15 to  20 minutes for medium rare.  </P> <P> Sprinkle flour into mushroom pan and cook, stirring over medium heat, until  nicely browned and mixed well with all pan drippings. Pour in reserved beef  broth and red wine.  </P> <P> Cook, stirring occasionally, until sauce has reduced and thickened. Slice  stuffed tenderloin into 1/2-inch thick slices and serve with sauce. Makes 2 to  4 servings.  </P> <P> Note: Serve with rice or barley pilaf.  </P> <P> STUFFED BEEF TENDERLOIN  </P> <P> (Italian Style)  </P> <P> 1 1/2 to 2 pounds beef tenderloin  </P> <P> Salt  </P> <P> Coarse ground pepper  </P> <P> 1 hard-cooked egg  </P> <P> 1 egg, lightly beaten  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon capers  </P> <P> 2 to 3 anchovy fillets, minced  </P> <P> 2 cloves garlic, minced  </P> <P> 1 bunch spinach, chopped  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons olive oil  </P> <P> 2 teaspoons brandy  </P> <P> 1/2 cup beef broth  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon butter  </P> <P> Make horizontal cut in 1 side of beef tenderloin and flatten out. Be careful  not to cut entirely through meat. Leave about 1-inch hinge. Season to taste  with pepper. Set aside.  </P> <P> Mash hard-cooked egg in large bowl and add beaten egg, capers, anchovy fillets,  garlic and chopped spinach. Mix thoroughly.  </P> <P> Spread spinach-egg mixture over meat. Roll up jellyroll fashion and tie with  string at 1-inch intervals.  </P> <P> Heat olive oil in heavy skillet over high heat and brown meat well on all  sides. Transfer to roasting pan and roast at 475 degrees 15 to 20 minutes for  medium rare.  </P> <P> Add brandy to skillet in which meat was browned and cook, stirring over medium  heat, to loosen any particles in bottom of pan. Add beef broth and continue  cooking, stirring occasionally, until sauce has reduced and thickened slightly.  </P> <P> Stir in butter just before serving to finish sauce. Slice stuffed tenderloin  and serve with just enough sauce on each slice to moisten. Makes 2 to 4  servings.  </P> <P> Note: Serve with rich, creamy risotto.  </P></p>

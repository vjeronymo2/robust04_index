			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Natalya Pospelova: "The Shoots of Zemstvo"] </F>   [Text] The current Russian Zemstvo Movement is only  half a year old. The recently held 2nd Congress of the RZM  [Russian Zemstvo Movement] adopted movement's program, which  will become its guideline for action for the next few years.    Civil peace will not happen by itself or by edict. It will  have to be patiently constructed out of different building  blocks: Mutual understanding, kindness, the desire to meet each  other halfway, and many, many other things. The Russian Zemstvo  Movement may also become such a building block.    In years past it often made itself known. The zemstvos  [elective district councils in pre-revolutionary Russia] did  more than just try to give the state a competent, skilled worker.    Having their own income, zemstvos improved the life of their  province, volost, city or village, based on the specific needs  of society. In Kaluga Province alone, for example, by the  beginning of the current century there were 200 hospitals under  zemstvo management, which employed 4,000 doctors. The relative  share of allocations for medical aid in the zemstvo budget  comprised about 26 percent, and for education--30 percent. Funds  for farm credit were established in the province, and craft  industry was supported. A technical high school was built in  Kaluga, craft and railroad vocational technical schools were  established, as well as a school for doctor's assistants, and  several men's and women's trade preparatory schools.    The idea to recreate, and not to revive, the zemstvo under  current conditions signifies not only the rebirth of the  traditions of people's self-government. It is a rebirth of  citizenship, state consciousness and togetherness. In short, it  is that common bond which is still capable of saving Russia. The  idea received support from the Russian Culture Fund and numerous  local culture funds, the Association of Small and Medium-Sized  Cities, the Moscow Confederation of Industrialists and  Entrepreneurs, the Russian Orthodox Church, as well as from  representatives of the administrations of a number of cities and  regions.    "Concrete endeavors--for the benefit of the Homeland and  Russian citizens"--that is the slogan of today's zemstvo  members. And they are ready to act immediately, relying on their  own efforts. The movement has developed a number of programs  which have taken into consideration the age-old experience, and  which are directed toward the social and economic development of  the regions. They are intended for a long-term period. Thus, the  "Family" program provides for the organization of medical  consultation centers, funds for aid to large and low-income  families, and for the founding of zemstvo-operated maternity  homes and children's pre-school institutions. (We might add,  such a nursery school is already in operation in Krasnogorskiy  Rayon near Moscow.) Particular attention is given to family  welfare. In cooperation with the Russian Orthodox Church,  old-age homes will be opened at the monasteries.    Or, there is also the "Enlightenment" program. It includes  the preparation and publication of textbooks on the Russian  language, history and literature, books for extracurricular  reading, and for stocking the libraries of schools and  pre-school institutions. There are plans to create a  wide-circulation and inexpensive series entitled "The Zemstvo  Library," which will acquaint the reader with an anthology of  Russian literature, and a series of monument-books in philology,  art, philosophy and religion. One of the first priority tasks  will be a program of vocational training for rural youth.    Russia is strong in her provinces. These words have become  almost an incantation. But how does the province live? The  lion's share of what it earns goes to the federal budget. Only  3-4 percent is left for the local treasury. Just try to teach,  cure and elevate culture on this money. In fact, it turns out  that the local organs of self-government have neither powers and  authorities, nor financial levers. Only a law on local  self-government, on new land reform can grant the regions broad  powers and authorities.    The opportunity to help one's native city, village, or  region  attracts Russian entrepreneurs to the RZM. Without limiting  themselves to the charitable bowl of soup, although this too is  often necessary, they are investing capital in the construction  of schools and kindergartens, in the restoration of  architectural monuments and in the repair of hospitals. The  leader of the movement, Yelena Panina, in October of last year  instituted and is already paying out three monthly stipends in  the name of Yekaterina Dashkova to women graduate students at  scientific-research institutes of the Academy of Sciences. The  company of Vladimir Sedoy, which is well known in Nizhniy  Novgorod for its trade enterprises and practice halls, has built  a school. For the present time, the attendance is comprised of  only first and second grade children, but Sedov intends to  expand and add on to it.    The RZM is a public association. It is notable that Russian  citizens themselves--teachers, engineers, scientists, and  representatives of the creative intelligentsia--act as the  initiators for organizing its local sections. As in the time of  Minin and Pozharskiy, the first to act was Nizhniy Novgorod.  However, the idea was soon picked up by Tver, Kaluga,  Petrozavodsk, Ufa and Krasnoyarsk.    As a form of improving local life, the RZM is capable of  integrating in itself various national and ethnic peculiarities  and traditions of the people living on a given territory. The  Ufa Zemstvo, for example, has unified the Russian, Tatar and  Bashkir communities.    In the lobbies of the congress I had occasion to speak with  its delegates and guests representing various strata of our  society.    "We, the communists," stressed Gennadiy Zyuganov, Chairman  of  the RFCP [Russian Federation Communist Party] Central Executive  Committee, "view the zemstvo movement as a counterweight to our  power. Our regional patriotic organizations closely cooperate  with the local zemstvo sections."    This thought was continued by the ottoman of the Kuban  Cossack troops, Yuriy Serebryakov:    "Today we are trying to take power into our hands by  democratic means, and primarily to take control of our primary  wealth--the land. We want to manage it ourselves, and not hand  it over to be squandered away by yesterday's partocrats and  today's sorry excuses for democrats."</p>

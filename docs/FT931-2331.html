			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / UK Company News: GPG's Brown Shipley stake goes over 30% GPG, the UK investment arm of Sir Ron Brierly, the New Zealand entrepreneur, yesterday informed the Stock Exchange its holding in Brown Shipley Holdings, had exceeded the 30 per cent mark which would oblige it to make a bid under the takeover code. But the rise in the stake to 30.02 per cent in the investment business, which is under offer from Kredietbank Luxembourgeoise, was understood to have been made in error. GPG did not intend making a mandatory bid. GPG said on Wednesday it was considering a full cash bid 5p higher than KBL's 30p offer. KBL has extended the deadline on its bid to next Thursday and is awaiting GPG's next move.</p>

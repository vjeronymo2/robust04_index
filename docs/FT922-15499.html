			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / UK Company News: European Motor calls for Pounds 17.4m in rights EUROPEAN MOTOR Holdings, the motor group launched out of Cargo Control last autumn, is raising Pounds 17.4m in a rights issue and buying the car wash equipment market leader. The 4-for-3 issue of 17.4m shares at 105p each, will mostly be used to fund the cash and shares acquisition of Casemount, parent company of Wilcomatic. The deal consists of a Pounds 5.5m purchase price, in 3.59m shares and Pounds 1.7m cash, plus the repayment of Pounds 12.9m debt. EMH's shares were suspended last week at 123p. Mr Richard Palmer, chief executive, said about Pounds 4m of the issue proceeds would be left over to repay EMH's debt, leaving the combined group ungeared on net assets of about Pounds 14.5m. Wilcomatic's 2,200 machines carried out 52m car washes last year. Founded 25 years ago, it was the subject of a management buy-out via Casemount in 1989. In the year to February 1 Casemount made an operating profit of Pounds 2.33m on turnover of Pounds 15.2m. It is EMH's second purchase in six months. Last October it bought Thomas Robinson's motor dealership business for Pounds 7.1m, which was accompanied by a share issue to raise Pounds 9.5m. Robinson was then under the care of a company doctor and has since been taken over by BM Group, the industrial holding group. That deal marked the launch of EMH out of the ashes of Cargo Control, which had suffered substantial losses at Transequip, its aircraft container manufacturing subsidiary. Cargo's pre-tax losses amounted to Pounds 735,000 for the six months to September 30. Mr Palmer, who built up Western Motors between 1987 and March 1990 when it was sold for Pounds 100m to TKM, said: 'Most of last year was spent sorting out the company and we sold Transequip, which was the most haemorrhaging subsidiary.' The combined group is forecast to have annual profits of just over Pounds 4m on turnover of more than Pounds 80m.</p>

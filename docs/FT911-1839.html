			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / International Company News: LTV unveils restructuring plan LTV, the third largest US steel manufacturer, yesterday unveiled a plan aimed at paving the way for it to emerge from the protection of the bankruptcy courts - but the package immediately ran into strong criticism from its creditors. The company estimates that its unsecured creditors will be paid a maximum of only 25 per cent of their claims, while LTV pays large amounts of available funds to its largest creditor, the Federal Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. The official LTV Steel Creditors' Committee said it believed the plan substantially overestimated the amounts creditors might recover and also meant a 'grossly unfair' allocation in favour of the PBGC and the company's pension plans. LTV sought Chapter 11 protection in 1986, when the US steel industry was in the throes of a severe shake-out. It was weighed down by underfunded pension liabilities and high debt and health care costs. A restructuring programme has been delayed by a long-running dispute with the FBGC, the US pension insurance agency, over payment for LTV's pension liabilities. But a breakthrough agreement between the two sides was achieved in February, clearing the way for yesterday's announcement by LTV of its first restructuring proposal. Under the pensions deal, LTV would contribute Dollars 880m in cash and assets to three pension funds and from 1993 would make annual fixed payments of Dollars 100m, plus 50 per cent of available cash flow above that figure. The agency's claims total over Dollars 2.3bn. LTV would raise Dollars 300m in new cash as part of the initial Dollars 880m and is considering asset sales to meet this commitment. Secured creditors would get 100 cents on the dollar but unsecured creditors would only get up to a quarter of their claims, and would be paid in new common stock. Current holders of common and preferred stock would also receive new paper, in the ratio of 1.11 new shares for each 100 previously owned. The company estimates the value of the new stock at Dollars 1bn to Dollars 1.25bn.</p>

			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / Allies fall out over protecting Bosnia safe areas Wide differences of emphasis between the outside powers involved in Bosnia have resurfaced as they debate how to defuse the crisis in Bihac, a stronghold of the Moslem-led government which has been surrounded by Serb forces. The US, strongly committed to the Bosnian government, has pressed for the establishment around Bihac of as wide as possible an 'exclusion zone' in which heavy weapons would be subject to air strikes. This measure would be aimed at the Serbs, who enjoy overwhelming superiority in heavy armour. France has been no less strident than the US in saying that the town of Bihac - a small and theoretically UN-protected area of the Bihac enclave - must not be allowed to fall. Paris was one of the first western capitals to moot the idea of extending the protected area northwards from the town by up to four miles, less than the US would like but still a breathing space. At the same time, France and Britain - whose troops form the linchpin of the UN ground force in Bosnia - have doubts about the feasibility of protecting Bihac with air power alone. London and Paris differ about what these doubts imply. British officials say the fall of Bihac may in practice prove impossible to prevent, while the French say the limits of air power reinforce the need to deploy more ground troops. This Anglo-French difference is more rhetorical than substantial. But not for the first time, Paris is proving quicker than London to seize the moral high ground in Bosnia. The US put forward its ideas as part of a plan to 'demilitarise' Bihac - a worthy-sounding objective whose precise meaning is bitterly disputed. If it means a surrender of weapons by the government army, whose battle-hardened Fifth Corps is based in Bihac and remains in business, then it will be hailed by the Serbs and rejected by the Bosnian authorities. The reverse may apply if the Fifth Corps is allowed to keep its weapons and use them elsewhere. This week's showdown around Bihac is the third crisis since the UN designated six Bosnian towns as 'safe areas' in May 1993. The international community failed to define their borders and sent a handful of troops to guard them. Nor was their status as safe areas ever respected by the warring parties. Serbs have blocked convoys to the enclaves, while Moslems have used them as launching pads for assaults. The 'safe area' concept was born out of fears of a bloodbath in April 1993, when the defenders of Srebrenica, one of three Moslem enclaves in the east, smuggled out a note, saying they could not hold out. On condition that government forces disarmed immediately, Bosnian Serb commander General Ratko Mladic agreed to halt the offensive. The UN never called it a surrender, but it was a unilateral disarmament. About 44,000 Moslems remain in Srebrenica, an unviable enclave at the far end of a life support system. In April, Moslem defenders tried to break out of Gorazde, about 45 miles south-east of Sarajevo. Scoffing at Nato threats, Bosnian Serb forces closed in on the town, which was crowded with 65,000 people, most of them refugees. Nato reacted with a series of small air strikes. Gorazde, like Sarajevo, was declared an 'exclusion zone' where heavy weapons could be subject to aerial bombing, and a ceasefire was negotiated. Eight months later, the enclave remains short of food, and conditions are miserable, but the government army appears to have retained some fire-power in the town - enough, in the UN's view, to stage occasional provocations.</p>

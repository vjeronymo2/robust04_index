			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] National Assembly proceedings resumed this  morning. Here is our reporter Saibou Yara Nyandou with a live  report.    [Nyandou] Indeed, they all turned up this morning and  exchanged accolades with their colleagues of the majority. They  have returned to the parliamentary family. By they, I mean:  Hama Amadou, Afara Djika, Moutari Moussa, Ila Kane, Amadou  Boukari, and others among the 33 parliamentary opposition  members. A little over two and a half months ago, during the  roll call, our eyes turned to their empty seats. However, since  28 May, following the announcement of their return, we have had  the certainty that they will stay, work, and participate in the  present and future sessions for the triumph of democracy and the  consolidation of the gains made so far.

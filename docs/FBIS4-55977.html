			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 24 May (TANJUG) -- Federal Foreign  Minister Vladislav Jovanovic today had a news conference with  participants in the 32d International Meeting of Journalists,  organized by the Associations of Yugoslav Journalists. The aim  of the meeting is to exchange opinions on journalism and the  world order. In response to many questions Jovanovic informed  his guests, from 36 countries which are taking part in the  meeting, about the basic principles of Yugoslavia's foreign  policy and the plans for the period after the sanctions are  lifted. He also explained the course of the Yugoslav crisis,  with a special comment on the Bosnian conflict.    "Our main commitment and the basic principles of our foreign  policy are peace, a political solution to the Yugoslav crisis,  and especially the Bosnian conflict, the lifting of the  sanctions and eventually a complete reintegration of the FRY  into international trends," the Yugoslav foreign minister said.    According to Jovanovic, when the sanctions are lifted,  Yugoslavia is ready to assume an active role in the  integrational processes not only in the Balkans, but also in  Europe. He mentioned one of the provisions of the Yugoslav  Constitution whereby all those who seceded can rejoin the FRY,  if they wish to do so. "We are open, not closed to others."    Asked by a Romanian journalist what the neighboring  countries  could do to speed up the lifting of the sanctions, Jovanovic  said: "The sanctions are not only the consequence, but also a  cause of the Yugoslav crisis. They are a cause because, unless  they are lifted, there will be no peace in Bosnia."    Jovanovic went on to say that the sanctions "have a deadly  effect on certain countries in the region." He said that the  neighboring countries could contribute to the lifting of the  sanctions if they treat them as their own problem, not only as  Yugoslavia's problem. This means that they should request an  explanation from the Security Council about the actual purpose  of the sanctions. Serbian-Croatian relations was one of the  issues raised at the news conference.    "Relations between Serbia and Croatia have been the key to  stability in the Balkans ever since the beginning of this  century," Jovanovic said.    "We are aware of this fact in the current crisis, too. But  we did not want this crisis. On the contrary, we had been  constantly warning of its consequences. Regrettably, the Croats  strove to bring about crisis, which resulted in heavy conflicts  between the two peoples. Our intentions are clear. We expect  Croatia to demonstrate goodwill in the full normalization of  relations."    In this context Jovanovic was asked about the division of  inherited assets between the former Yugoslav republics and the  FRY.    "First of all, the division of assets should be separated  from our right to continuity. The process of dividing assets is  taking place within the Geneva Conference. It is unfortunately  making very slow progress. The reason behind this is the fact  that the FRY insists that all the rights and obligations  pertaining to the division [of assets] should include everything  that stems from 1918; in the case of the Former Yugoslav  Republic of Macedonia everything that stems from the Balkans  wars. The seceded Yugoslav republics insist on dividing what  had been created together since the 1974 Constitution".    The reporters were interested in the media war against the  FRY.    "We have lost the media war without taking part in it. This  is in a way a result of our mentality since we believe in the  truth and are incapable of peddling lies to the world."    A reporter from Israel asked Jovanovic about  Yugoslav-Israeli  relations.    Jovanovic said that since the end of World War II  Yugoslavia's foreign policies were formulated and carried out by  people from the western half of the country. He noted that  Tito, Kardelj, Bakaric, Vrhovec, and Loncar had been the chief  designers.    "Serbian politicians were not influential in formulating  foreign policies," Jovanovic said and added: "For example, the  decision to break off diplomatic relations with Israel was taken  by Tito at a time when he was visiting the Soviet Union. Marko  Nikezic opposed this but he was ignored."    "We are sorry if Israel thinks that the FRY is responsible  for the suspension of diplomatic ties in 1967. I would like to  remind you that, even before the disintegration of the Socialist  Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Serbian President Slobodan  Milosevic tried to exert influence on Yugoslav foreign policy,  but he failed to do so because of the dominance of people from  the western part of the country."    "We want Israel to open an embassy in Belgrade as soon as  possible," Jovanovic said.    In conclusion Jovanovic commented on the latest efforts to  solve the Bosnian conflict. He said Belgrade supports efforts  leading to peace, and in that context he stressed the importance  of the recent Geneva meeting of the five foreign ministers from  the EU, Russia, and the United States.    "It is commendable that the five foreign ministers are  trying  together to search for peace. It is commendable that they have  gone back to the European plan, and that they agreed there would  be no solution to the Bosnian conflict unless the sanctions are  lifted. We believe that the meeting of the five would have been  more successful if they had adopted a clearer position on the  sanctions. I assert that the Bosnian Muslims will sign a peace  agreement two weeks after the lifting of the sanctions."</p>

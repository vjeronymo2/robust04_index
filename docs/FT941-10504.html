			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / Observer: Paddy's revenge Action man Paddy Ashdown lived up to his reputation the other night with a robust suggestion on how best to tame the BBC's hard-nosed interviewer, Jeremy Paxman, who frequently terrorises politicians on BBC's Newsnight. 'Kick him on the shins under the table,' the Liberal Democrat leader told a House of Lords dinner for aspiring ethnic minority Lib Dem MPs. No sooner had the ex-commando passed on this fighting tip than the BBC pulled him away for an 11th hour appearance on . . . Newsnight. Obviously, Paddy doesn't kick hard enough.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Supreme Court yesterday gave reasons for its  ruling against the celebration of 31 December as a public  holiday and funding the celebrations from public funds. It  would be recalled that on 29 December 1993, the court gave a  five-four majority decision in favor of a writ filed by the New  Patriotic Party [NPP]. In the writ, the NPP sought from the  Supreme Court a declaration making it unconstitutional for the  government to declare 31 December as a public holiday.    Five justices of the Supreme Court ruled that the  celebration  was unconstitutional. They are Justices N.Y.B. Adade, G.R.M.  Francois, K.E. Amoah-Sakyi, G.E.K. Aikins, and C.F.  Hayfron-Benjamin. Those who dissented are the Chief Justice,  Mr. Justice Philip Archer, and Justices Abban, A.K.B. Appiah,  and Mrs. Justice Bamford Addo. It took the nine judges eight  and half hours to give reasons for their judgment.    The chief justice, Mr. Justice Archer, said in his opinion  he  did not see the celebration as unconstitutional. He said under  the public holiday's ordnance, it is only the executive and the  legislature that have the right to declare public holidays. He  said the court should not be made to extend its hands to areas  which are unconstitutional and illegal to tread. Mr. Justice  Archer said if people feel the need that the day should not be  celebrated they should submit to parliament to change the  schedule of PNDC [Provisional National Defense Council] Law 220,  the public holidays law. He also said since parliament  judiciously voted money for the celebration, in his opinion, it  is constitutional that public funds could be used to finance the  celebration.    Mr. Justice Abban said the indemnity clause in the  Constitution makes the suit null and void. He said the behavior  of Ghanaians toward the coups of 1966, 1972, 1979, and 31  December 1981, as well as the indemnity clauses in the 1969,  1979, and 1992 Constitutions made the coups historically vain.  Mr. Justice Abban said the argument that the celebration of 31  December was discriminatory was not sound. He said if such a  submission was upheld then the declaration of 25 December, the  birth of Christ, Good Friday, and such days could as well be  challenged by other non-Christian religious groups. He said it  must be clear that the declaration of public holidays is a  political issue and that it is the people through their elected  representatives who should set aside such days.    Mrs. Justice Bamford Addo said it is not for the judiciary  to  formulate public policies. She said the suit is caught by  Article 34 of the Constitution and that should it be even  accepted that the celebration is unconstitutional, that clause  will still override findings.    Mr. Justice N.Y.B. Adade, one of the five judges who agreed  that the declaration of 31 December as a public holiday is  unconstitutional, submitted that the celebration of the day has  the tendency of playing up the idea of military coups, which  contravenes the spirit and letter of the Constitution. He said  the indemnity clause in the Constitution accepts the illegality  of the event of 31 December 1981. He said that if it is  accepted that the celebration is constitutional, the flood gates  are being opened for other coup d'etat days to be celebrated.    Mr. Justice Francois said the day could be celebrated  provided it is not funded from public funds. He said the 1992  Constitution buried the immediate past and imposed an embargo on  future coups. He said the indemnity clause exempts coup makers  from penalties for their actions.    In his judgment Mr. Justice Amoah-Sakyi said 24 February, 13  January, June 4, and 31 December -- the days coups were staged  in Ghana -- ceased to be public holidays immediately democracy  was restored. He said the court is to make all agencies of  government to act within the parameters of the law. Mr. Justice  Amoah-Sakyi concluded: We have had enough of coup d'etats, we  want it no more.    Mr. Justice G.E.K. Aikins held the view that the celebration  and financing of the day are unconstitutional and an affront to  democracy. He said but for the indemnity clauses, all those who  stage coups would be tried after a constitutional government is  restored. This, he said, implies the unconstitutionality of  celebrating such days as public holidays. He said any law that  is inconsistent with the Constitution is declared null and void.  It is the view of Mr. Justice Aikins that PNDC Law 220, the  public holiday law, has some inconsistencies when tested with  the spirit and letter of the 1992 Constitution. He said those  inconsistencies had made the law void. Consequently, it will be  unconstitutional to celebrate the day.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 10 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa left for Washington on Thursday [10 February] for a  summit meeting with U.S. President Bill Clinton, which is  expected to focus on stalled trade negotiations.    Hosokawa and wife Kayoko, who departed on a government  aircraft from Haneda Airport, are scheduled to arrive in  Washington later Thursday evening local time.    The prime minister will meet with Clinton for two hours  Friday in an effort to break the deadlock over trade issues.    He is also scheduled to attend a joint press conference with  Clinton, meet with leaders of the Republican Party, and deliver  a speech in English at Clinton's alma mater, Georgetown  University.    Hosokawa is scheduled to return to Japan on Sunday.    It will be the third meeting between the two leaders, but  Clinton is expected to press Hosokawa harder this time for a  "results-oriented" agreement on the bilateral trade framework  negotiations.</p>

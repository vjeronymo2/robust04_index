			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Errors led to shortfall of Pounds 35m in business rates fund THE DEPARTMENT of the Environment may have lost more than Pounds 35m in the first year of collecting business rates because of errors in figures supplied by local authorities. The losses arose because the department accepted as reliable local authority figures that had been qualified by their auditors. A report published today by the National Audit Office, the government expenditure watchdog, says the department was slow to realise the significance of the auditors' qualifications. Over a third of the returns sent in by local authorities had been qualified by their auditors. The main reason was weaknesses in councils' computer systems which made it hard to check that the correct amount of business rates had been collected. The returns are used to redist-ribute income from uniform bus-iness rates between local authorities according to a nationally determined formula. Councils that collect more than they are entitled to must pay money into a pool; those that collect less receive a net payment. After the end of the year, the environment department makes a final adjustment for each council based on its audited return. Once the final adjustment has been made, the department cannot reopen the case, even if mistakes later emerge. At the end of 1990-91, the first year of the system, 123 out of 366 returns had been qualified by their auditors. The first 36 qualified returns, covering Pounds 962m, were settled by the department without questioning the significance of the qualifications. Steps were taken with the remaining 87 qualified returns to resolve problems arising from auditors' concerns. However, the audit office says there may still have been losses where local authority computer systems provided inadequate evidence to check the accuracy of payments. The exact shortfall is difficult to quantify, according to the audit office. However, it estimates that the environment department failed to collect up to Pounds 22.5m, and wrongly paid out up to Pounds 13.2m. Some of this shortfall may be recouped in later years, according to the audit office. The report says that steps have been taken to improve the accuracy and auditability of the returns for future years. As a result of the shortfall, Sir John Bourn, head of the NAO, has qualified his audit opinion on the environment department's 1991-92 account for non-domestic rates.

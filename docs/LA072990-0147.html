			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIGHTING WORDS  </P> <P> Regarding "Fighting Words," by Sarah Henry (June 10), I have been a bilingual  teacher for 15 years. The great majority of those who immigrate here value  English very much.  </P> <P> Give them three to seven years and they will learn to speak English. Many will  learn English in crowded evening English as a Second Language classes -- after  picking your food, cleaning your table at restaurants, hauling off your trash,  fixing your car, cleaning the bedpans at your local hospital or cleaning your  house.  </P> <P> Their children will learn, too. If they are lucky, they will maintain skills in  their native language. That will increase their chance of landing a better job  than that of their parents.  </P> <P> The majority of these immigrants will learn English, even with all the  hardships they must endure as America's underclass. Will you, advocates of  English only, learn compassion?  </P> <P> LINDA J. DILLON  </P> <P> Ventura  </P></p>

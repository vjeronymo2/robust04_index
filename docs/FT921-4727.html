			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / Rugby Union: Amateur code's key professional - The man who has transformed English rugby MOMENTS before the kick-off of this afternoon's match between England and Wales at Twickenham, a big, sandy-haired man will take his position in the one unnumbered seat in the officials' box in the West stand. Beneath the hair and eyebrows, there will probably be a smile on his face. Dudley Wood can be permitted that. Rugby Union is enjoying an unprecedented boom in popularity and Wood, the secretary of the English Rugby Football Union, is the man who deserves the credit for transforming it into the most modern and best-run rugby union in the world. 'I am just a hired hand', he says, modestly. 'I am the servant of The Committee.' The reality is that Wood was the first high-powered businessman to move from industry to rugby administration, and he has been a brilliant success. 'It simply isn't good enough to appoint enthusiastic ex-players to these positions any more,' he says. 'Sport is a mixture of everything from high politics to low jokes.' Since Wood arrived at Twickenham in August 1986, England's success on the field has been matched by an improvement off it. Turnover? Up from Pounds 5m to Pounds 40m. Staff? Risen from 40 to 100, including part-timers. Ticketing? All computerised and done in-house. Seating? Increased to 60,000 and soon to be increased again, to 75,000. After leaving Oxford with a degree in modern languages, Wood spent more than 30 years with ICI in its petrochemicals division. Retirement was nearing when he was nudged into applying for the secretaryship of the ERFU. His application arrived on the closing date. When he got the job, he was horrified to discover that the telephone number of the ERFU was ex-directory. He changed that immediately. He has initiated an unprecedented opening-up of Twickenham, from establishing of excellent relations with local residents to improving facilities for wheelchairs. Journalists, used to being palmed-off with non-committal statements and numerous no-comments, found themselves invited to regular press conferences at which Wood and his officials would answer questions on any subject. He fought for, and got, club-class travel for the England players and has given a woman on his staff the responsibility of looking after the wives and girl-friends of every player in the England development squad. The result is that his personal standing is high and the ERFU is no longer perceived to be an outdated, ill-managed coterie of plummy-voiced former public schoolboys. You get Wood's measure when you discover the standing in which he is held outside rugby. He recently received a letter from a head-hunter searching for a new chief executive for the Squash Rackets Association. 'Since you are widely held to be the role model for such positions, do you have any ideas?' it read. Wood's counsel was sought when the Football Association was searching for a chief executive. But he says: 'I am not an ideas man. By training, I am a marketing man. I can sell other people's ideas.' In two particular areas, Wood's profile has been high. The first is in fighting to maintain the view that rugby is still an amateur game. 'I regret that I have not won that argument,' he says. 'The point is this: rugby is better on the basis on which it is now played than on any other. We must not throw out its greatest virtue, which is that it is a leisure activity for those who earn a living. 'It is a sport for players who have to work on a Monday. I like the idea that Jonathan Webb took someone's appendix out on the morning of the Harlequins vs Bath game and that Nigel Heslop went skiing in midseason. I was delighted when Rob Andrew was made chartered surveyor of the year. These guys are individuals. They've got their priorities right. They have a right to lead their own lives.' This view is seen by some as old-fashioned - typical of an elderly administrator who is anti-money and thus anti the England players' Run with the Ball campaign. 'We do not have the right to stop players profiting from activities outside rugby, like opening supermarkets, but I do draw the line at them asking a fee for making a speech at a rugby dinner. That is taking money out of the game. That is wrong.' After the Run with the Ball campaign was approved by the international board, Wood wrote in the ERFU magazine: 'In other words, rugby players, no doubt because of their new-found fame, can receive an appropriate fee for appearing or talking in a non-rugby milieu. Big deal] Not, I think, a revolution or the end of an amateur sport.' The second area in which his name is always mentioned is as an after-dinner speaker. There are those who are self-deprecating, those who tell a string of jokes, and those whose humour is at the expense of others. Wood belongs to the last group. 'No one doubts his intelligence,' he said of a well-known rugby official. 'It's just that no one ever mentions it.' On another occasion, he stood up after a lacklustre speech by the club chairman and asked: 'How did the charisma bypass operation go?' Such irreverence could be dangerous coming from a paid official of the ERFU, so it is a measure of the esteem in which Wood is held that his victims bear no grudges. Wood retires, aged 65, in 1995. If he carries on for the next three years as sure-footedly as he has done for the past six, a significant reward would be in order.</p>

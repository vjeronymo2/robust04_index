			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / Finance and the Family: The Week Ahead The new management at Trafalgar House is expected to undertake a thorough house-cleaning operation - including further extensive asset write-downs and provisions - when the troubled conglomerate reports its full-year results on Tuesday. The group took Pounds 120m of provisions to cover restructuring and property write-downs at the interim stage, and a further Pounds 100m to Pounds 150m of provisions are expected to be announced. Although the group is expected to post a small underlying annual profit, the provisions are likely to result in full-year pre-tax losses of up to Pounds 250m compared with losses of Pounds 30.3m the previous year. The company has already forecast a full-year dividend of 3.25p, down from 6p a year earlier. Asda, the UK's fourth-biggest grocery superstore group, is expected on Friday to announce an increase in interim pre-tax profits to between Pounds 75m and Pounds 85m. The substantial increase from last year's pre-exceptional figure of Pounds 46m suggests Asda's recovery is still on course. But analysts will be keen to hear more details of how last week's sale of the Allied carpet business to Carpetland will benefit Asda's cost structure. Exceptional costs of Pounds 70m, and a goodwill write-off of Pounds 53.3m associated with the Allied sale, will be taken in the full-year figures and not in the first half. The Daily Mail and General Trust is expected on Wednesday to publish pre-tax profits for the year of about Pounds 73m, excluding exceptional items. This represents good progress compared with last year's profits of Pounds 59m on a similar basis, and indicates an improving environment for display advertising. But analysts will be looking particularly at the costs of recent supplement launches and the company's strategy for the electronic media. Greene King, the East Anglia-based brewer, is expected to report first-half pre-tax profits 11 per cent ahead at Pounds 10.5m on Monday. Beer volumes are likely to have fallen, but by less than the 3 per cent market decline. An improvement is forecast in bad debt provisions, and a substantial increase in food sales will have contributed to a good performance by the company's managed pubs. A 7 per cent increase in full-year results is forecast from Vaux Group on Tuesday, with pre-tax profits, before property and exceptionals, of about Pounds 26.5m. Brewing and pub operations will be boosted by acquisitions, although like-for-like beer volumes will be lower. A continued recovery can be expected from the group's hotels on the back of higher occupancy rates.</p>

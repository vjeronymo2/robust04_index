			<p><P> June 3, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RETIREMENT FUND WILL SELL, NOT REDO, ANAHEIM PLAZA  </P> <P> The owner of the Anaheim Plaza mall has decided to sell the center rather than  spend millions to renovate it, a spokeswoman said Friday.  </P> <P> The California State Teachers Retirement System pension fund, which owns the  center, made the decision to sell the mall this week after receiving several  unsolicited offers from developers interested in buying it, said Charlotte  Ellis, vice president of marketing for the Lehndorff Group in Dallas, the  property manager for the mall.  </P> <P> The reasons for the flurry of inquiries from developers about the 34-year-old  mall are not clear. The result, however, Ellis said, is that the pension fund  plans to hire a Wall Street investment firm to actively market the  827,000-square-foot center.  </P> <P> Anaheim Plaza has for some time suffered from sagging sales and a loss of  tenants.  </P> <P> In 1986, the center reported the sharpest sales drop of any county mall; its  taxable sales had slipped 5.6% to $84 million. In 1987 -- the last year for  which numbers are available -- sales dipped 1.2% to $83 million, ranking it No.  10 in sales among the county's 13 major malls, according to the State Board of  Equalization.  </P> <P> The mall suffered a serious blow last year when Robinson's closed its store  there. The building it occupied -- now owned by the pension fund -- is vacant.  </P> <P> Robinson's departure left only the Broadway and Mervyn's department stores as  anchor tenants. The vacancy rate at the mall is now 31%, Ellis said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Renovated in Early 1970s  </P> <P> Last December, in a move intended to boost sales, the pension fund approved a  multimillion-dollar face-lift for the mall, last updated in the early 1970s.  Elaborate plans called for new entrance facades and awnings, brighter lighting,  new windows and floors, and outdoor seating. Long-range plans called for adding  two department stores, a second retail level and possibly a hotel.  </P> <P> But spending the money to renovate, Ellis said, would have involved "a certain  amount of risk -- and it's a greater risk than a pension fund ordinarily can  take."  </P> <P> Pension fund officials in Sacramento could not be reached Friday.  </P></p>

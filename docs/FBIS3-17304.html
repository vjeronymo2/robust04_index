			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS special correspondent Aleksandr Trushin] </F>   [Text] Santiago, 24 Mar -- Retired General David Shoval,  director of a directorate in Israel's Defense Ministry, is for  close contacts between Israel and Russia in the  military-industrial sphere. In an interview with ITAR-TASS on  Wednesday [23 March], he said that there are good prospects for  such cooperation, especially for joint modernization of old  military equipment.    We should look for ways of cooperating in the  military-industrial field. It would have been difficult to  imagine this cooperation five years ago, but today it is quite  possible. We made our first contacts at aerospace salons in  Singapore and Paris and we should also use the [current]  FIDAE-94 [expansion unknown] [exhibition]. We still do not know  each other well. In the military-industrial sphere, we could  start by exchanging information, David Shoval said.    All of Israel's state, private, and mixed enterprises  producing arms and military equipment are subordinated to the  directorate headed by Retired General D. Shoval, which controls  all of Israel's military exports.    Retired General Shoval is in Santiago as one of the heads of  the Israeli delegation at the international FIDAE-94 aerospace  exhibition. On show from Israel's military industry are  military trucks and service trucks, electronic arms, land, air  and sea firing systems, and small arms weapons. According to  the [retired] general, the most promising developments are in  the field of infrared apparatus, [examples of which are] on show  at the exhibition.    Currently, nearly 80 percent of Israel's military production  is exported, some going to South America, said David Shoval.  During the exhibition, a deal was struck with Chile for the  delivery of service vehicles for the Carbineers Corps. At the  same time, military budgets are being reduced in practically all  countries of the world and Israel is no exception. As a result,  some of our enterprises have started to modernize old equipment  and weapons and are cooperating with a number of foreign firms  in this. We could begin such cooperation with Russia, in  particular, by renovating the close-range MIG-21 fighters. "You  have high technology, while we could install modern electronic  equipment in old planes. Currently, thousands of old MIG's are  out of use. If we brighten them up, it could be a mutually  profitable business," David Shoval said.</p>

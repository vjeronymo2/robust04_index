			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / European space budget cut A SOMBRE director-general of the European Space Agency said yesterday the world economic crisis would force ESA to slash spending until the year 2001 by Ecus 4bn (Pounds 3.1bn), Reuter reports from Paris. Mr Jean-Marie Luton also indicated to reporters that Europe's most ambitious space project, the Hermes manned space shuttle, was dead. Mr Luton was commenting on a draft budget he will propose to industry and science ministers from ESA's 13 member states, who meet in Paris on October 12-13 to decide future programmes. Mr Luton said ESA's draft budget for 1994-2000 would be Ecus 18bn (Pounds 13.9bn) instead of Ecus 22bn as planned until drastic cuts in spending were ordered by the agency's ministerial council in Spain last November.</p>

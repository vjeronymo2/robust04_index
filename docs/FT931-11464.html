			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / International Company News: Kolbenschmidt chief executive warns continued losses possible KOLBENSCHMIDT, the car components subsidiary of the Metallgesellschaft group, may make losses until the end of 1994, the new chief executive warned. Mr Heinrich Binder said that the market for car suppliers had become more difficult since the start of the new business year in October. In the year to the end of September, group losses were DM90m (Dollars 56.9m) after barely breaking even in the previous year. He said the loss for the current year would not exceed last year's figure and sales would be no less than the DM1.51bn achieved in 1991-92. Sales in the first quarter rose 11 per cent to DM396m. The company's air-bag and steering-wheel businesses were expected to do well during the year, but all other operations would be put on short-time working for six months.</p>

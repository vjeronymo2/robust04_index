Twelve people were arrested a short while ago after the hostages  were released. The drama started early this afternoon when  three House of Delegates employees were taken hostage by a group  of seven (Bunela) residents at Truro House. They demanded that  charges of trespassing against them be dropped. They had been  charged with illegally occupying houses at Cato Manor near  Durban. The suspects will appear in court tomorrow.</p>

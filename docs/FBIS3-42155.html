			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Moscow, Feb. 2 [dateline as received] (YONHAP) --  The Russian Government hopes to expand military cooperation with  South Korea as it would contribute to peace and stability in the  Asia and Pacific region, Vice Defense Minister Andrei Kokoshin  says.    In an exclusive interview with YONHAP News Agency, Kokoshin  said Wednesday that Russia positively evaluates its cooperation  in the military field with South Korea.    The prospects for further expansion of such cooperation are  bright, he said.    The development of military cooperation between the two  countries will not have an adverse effect on any third country  but rather contribute to the easing of tensions in the  Asia-Pacific region, he noted.    Kokoshin, who is in charge of Russia's defense industry,  said  that conditions are ripe for South Korean companies to take part  in the process of privatizing Russia's arms industry.    Russia needs South Korean capital for joint development of  its arms industry as well as Korea's expertise in marketing.    He said the Russian Government is prepared to supply  up-to-date military hardware to South Korea to help repay loans  the former Soviet Union had taken out from Seoul. Moscow has  already made a proposal and is now awaiting the Seoul  government's reply, he added.    He also said there was no room for doubt about President  Boris Yeltsin's promise that Russia would not provide North  Korea with offensive weapons, a pledge Moscow would continue to  honor.    With regard to the North Korean nuclear issue, Kokoshin said  the Russian Government's basic policy is that Pyongyang should  not have any nuclear weapons and therefore, Moscow will do its  utmost to achieve that goal.    In any event, Russia believes that the level of North  Korea's  nuclear development isn't very high, he added.</p>

			<p><P> March 23, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> AIDING THE INNER HEALING OF BURN VICTIMS  </P> <P> Ten-year-old Damon Kimball does not remember the accident in which his father  backed over him in the family car, causing injuries that have permanently  scarred his face and chest.  </P> <P> Damon was only 2 1/2 when the accident occurred. His father, who had a stroke  and died two years ago, thought that his son was in the back seat when he  pressed his foot on the accelerator.  </P> <P> Today, after several corrective surgeries and the passage of time, Damon's  burn-like scars on his left cheek no longer impair his vision or limit the use  of his mouth. But when he is among strangers, some still stare or point and  murmur, making it hard for the scars inside to heal fully.  </P> <P> Damon's father was separated from his mother, Pat Kimball, when the accident  occurred during an outing with two of his three young sons. Somehow, Damon  survived, with deep-tissue abrasions -- "tire burns" -- over 90% of his face  and chest. During his hospital stay, the outer layers of his skin were removed  repeatedly in scrub baths to prevent infection and help the skin to heal  properly.  </P> <P> For two years, Damon wore a ski mask-like bandage over his head in an attempt  to reduce the scarring. He also wore a pressure bandage around his chest to  keep the reddish welts of scar tissue from swelling during the long healing  process.  </P> <P> "The initial trauma is horrendous," Pat Kimball said recently at the family's  Granada Hills home. "It follows you forever."  </P> <P> But Damon and his family eventually found some relief from an unexpected  source. Last year, a representative of the Alisa Ann Ruch California Burn  Foundation visited Damon's school as part of a public education program  designed to teach schoolchildren how to prevent burn injuries.  </P> <P> The foundation, which has headquarters in Canoga Park, provides prevention  programs to schools, businesses and community groups, and services to burn  survivors and their families throughout the state. It also funds burn care  research and operates a summer camp at Wonder Valley Ranch, about 30 miles east  of Fresno, for burn survivors ages 5 to 18.  </P> <P> During the talk at Tulsa Elementary School in Granada Hills, Damon said he  learned how to "stop, drop and roll" should he catch fire.  </P> <P> Soon afterward, he learned about the ranch. Pat Kimball says a week at summer  camp last year went a long way to help her son renew his confidence and focus  on a goal: Damon says he wants to be a member of a police SWAT team when he  grows up.  </P> <P> The foundation, which operates with a small full-time staff and a large number  of volunteers, was created in 1971 in the memory of an 8-year-old Southern  California girl who was fatally burned in a back-yard barbecue fire. It is  supported solely by contributions.  </P> <P> Although much of the foundation's efforts are aimed at burn prevention and  helping children, the staff and volunteers also work with adult burn victims,  their families and even their co-workers to help build understanding and  cooperation when a burned person returns to work. A similar in-school program  is conducted to prepare a child's classmates and teachers for an injured  child's return to school.  </P> <P> After Damon's accident, Kimball said, she did what she could to make sure that  her son got the medical care he needed. While her marriage foundered, she went  back to school and got a degree in early childhood education.  </P> <P> When her husband died suddenly two years ago, she filed for bankruptcy and  began again, moving to Granada Hills from Sepulveda with Damon, Ethan, 14, and  Justin, 18. She works full time with young disabled children in the Glendale  Unified School District.  </P> <P> Before Damon went to camp, Kimball said she did what she could to be a model  for her son when they were in public, showing him ways to manage on his own.  </P> <P> "I see you notice my son's scars. We're so lucky he's alive," she would tell  adults and children who stared at Damon while they were shopping. The  rehabilitation period was long and painful.  </P> <P> "I'm a special education teacher, and I talk to parents all the time about  their kids' handicaps," Kimball said. "It's a very different story when it's  your own child."  </P> <P> To be eligible for the camp, children must have sustained burns or burn-like  injuries. They do not have to be severe. Foundation officials said the most  important consideration is: Can a child benefit from spending time at camp,  like other children, swimming, riding horses, playing with go-carts and playing  games?  </P> <P> "Champ Camp" gives each child a week away from home under medical supervision.  No one stops and stares; no one asks how or why. "Campers aren't permitted to  ask about the nature of each other's injuries," said Tom Kiefer, the  foundation's director of burn services. A registered nurse is on duty 24 hours  a day.  </P> <P> Although the camp is in a rural setting, the facilities are not rustic.  "Children with burn injuries must keep their skin especially clean," Kiefer  said. "All rooms are equipped with showers, and children are monitored by the  nursing staff to make sure they take proper care of their healing wounds. Those  who require medications receive them, under supervision and with the child's  doctor's permission."  </P> <P> The week at camp last summer marked the first time that Damon and his mother  were separated, and Kimball said she was concerned about sending her son to  camp with children who had suffered devastating, disfiguring injuries. She was  afraid that he would "see other kids with limitations and feel a part of this."  </P> <P> But she decided that the potential benefits outweighed the risk that Damon  would identify himself as disfigured and disabled. "I knew I had a child who  was very distressed about everything in his life. His father died. We moved. He  transferred schools. I had a new job."  </P> <P> In the end, the week at camp was "the greatest thing that ever happened to  him," Kimball said. "For one week, he was a little boy who didn't have a scar.  He didn't have to worry. . . . That experience has sustained him all year. The  nurses, the firemen at camp are all so understanding."  </P> <P> Firefighters and their wives make up the largest segment of volunteer  counselors at the camp; they use their special understanding of the trauma of  burn injuries to help children have fun without being self-conscious. Some  firefighters return year after year, Kiefer said.  </P> <P> "The experience really helps rebuild a fragmented person," Kimball said. "I'm  not saying camp solved all his problems, but it gave Damon a chance to depend  on other people. They enjoyed him for who he is."  </P> <P> Damon says he loved his time at camp and wants to return this summer. Kiefer  said that although invitations to camp haven't been issued, each year the  number of campers increases as donated camperships rise. Children who could  benefit from a return visit do go back, and "Damon will go to camp this summer  if I have anything to say about it," Kiefer said.  </P> <P> The week at camp ends each year with a trip to Disneyland to help the children  test the coping skills they learned.  </P> <P> Damon recalls that some people at Disneyland stared at the campers. They  wouldn't have, though, if they hadn't worn their Champ Camp T-shirts, he said.  Damon had forgotten about the scars.  </P> <P> Kiefer said Champ Camp, in its fourth year, expects to have 100 youngsters this  summer, giving children "a week without scars," a "pure camp experience," a  chance to experience new successes, try new things and meet new people.  </P> <P> The severity of the burn injury is not an issue, Kiefer said. "We're much more  interested in the child and what the burn means to them."  </P> <P> (In the Los Angeles area, the foundation oversees a support group for adult  burn survivors and the parents of burn survivors. It meets at Westside  Pavilion. The foundation refers residents of the San Fernando Valley to Sherman  Oaks Community Hospital's support group for burn survivors; the foundation  doesn't attempt to duplicate the hospital's service.)  </P> <P> </P> <P> How to Prevent Burns  </P> <P> The Alisa Ann Ruch California Burn Foundation of Canoga Park gives the  following tips during presentations on burn prevention:  </P> <P> * Cool a burn. Put burned skin under cool water for at least 20 minutes. Use a  faucet, shower, whatever is handy. Do not use butter, ice or grease. They will  only further damage tissue.  </P> <P> * Avoid scalds. Most burns are the result of scalds, and most scalds are  suffered by children. Be careful when cooking or drinking hot liquids. Keep pot  handles, cups of coffee or tea out of the reach of children.  </P> <P> * Cook with care. Keep children out of the way when cooking. If grease catches  fire, place a lid over the pan and turn off the burner. Never use water to try  to extinguish a grease fire. Make sure pot handles are turned toward the back  of the stove, out of the reach of children.  </P> <P> * Stop, drop and roll. If your clothes catch fire, stop where you are, drop to  the ground or floor, and roll over and over until the flames are out.  </P> <P> * Install smoke detectors. Install at least one smoke detector on every level  of your home and one outside each sleeping area. Test them once a month.  Replace batteries at least once a year, and keep detectors free of dust and  cobwebs.  </P> <P> * Plan a home escape route. Find two ways out of each room in the house. Make  special provisions for infants, elderly and disabled members of your family.  Establish a place outside where everyone will gather. Practice the escape plan  with all family members.  </P> <P> * Check electrical cords. Replace cords that are frayed or broken. Do not place  extension cords beneath rugs or carpet where they can be stepped on and broken.  </P> <P> * Turn water heater thermostats down. Most water heaters are set at 170  degrees. Hot liquid at 150 degrees can cause a third-degree burn in one second.  Water heaters should be set between low and medium (120 to 130 degrees) to  prevent scalding.  </P> <P> * Watch out for smokers. If you permit smoking in your home, make sure that  cigarettes are extinguished in large, deep ashtrays. Empty ashtrays into the  toilet. Never smoke in bed.  </P> <P> * Be careful with flammable liquids. Use only approved gasoline storage cans.  Avoid contact with battery acid, hot oil and radiator steam.  </P></p>

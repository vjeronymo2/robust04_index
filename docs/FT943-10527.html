			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Members back merger of northern building societies The planned merger between Northern Rock Building Society, the UK's 11th largest, and North of England Building Society, its smaller neighbour, has been approved overwhelmingly by members of both organisations. The approvals - reflecting the consent of more than 90 per cent of members voting - mean that the merger is on course to go ahead on October 1. While the percentages of approvals were impressive, the turnout figures were rather less so. Only about 10 per cent of North of England's 330,000 or so potential votes were cast. And just 1 or 2 per cent of Northern Rock's 764,405 investing members and 186,917 borrowers took part. Mr Chris Sharp, Northern Rock managing director, was unapologetic about the low proportion of voting. He said there was no reason to suppose that those who did not vote were unhappy with the merger plans. Yesterday's special general meeting of Northern Rock - only the second since the society was formed in 1965 - offered a vivid illustration of how even a small amount of member participation can put society directors on the spot. Though little more than a hundred members attended the meeting, this did not guarantee a trouble-free ride for Mr Robert Dickinson, chairman. A series of waspish questions - delivered by apparently benign senior citizens - aired several prickly issues, including directors' pay and the bonus offered as part of the deal to North of England, but not Northern Rock, members. Silver-haired retired head teacher Miss Marguerite Maxwell weighed in first. She had been a Northern Rock investor for 30 years, she said, while a friend had moved her account to the North of England. 'She who deserted the Northern Rock gets a bonus and I who have been a loyal member do not. I don't agree with that and I think it most unfair.' Mr Dickinson gave the standard response: North of England's reserves were larger and that society would disappear, whereas Northern Rock would remain. Miss Maxwell, unimpressed, was supported by another rebel who asked plaintively: 'Couldn't you give a sweetener to Northern Rock members?' Later, and marginally less diplomatically, Mr Sharp said that people stayed with Northern Rock and with some other societies because they knew that in the longer-term that was where their best interests lay. 'There is no way I would have attempted to persuade my board to pay a bonus to Northern Rock members at this time,' he said. 'We are a dynamic and ongoing outfit.' The 1.4m members of Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society will get a similar opportunity to cross-question their directors at the special general meeting which must be held to seek their approval for the Pounds 1.8bn cash offer from Lloyds Bank.</p>

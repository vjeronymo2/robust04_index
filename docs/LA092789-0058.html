			<p><P> September 27, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 30,000 TONS WOULD BE BURNED AT SITES IN 8 STATES;  </P> <P> U.S. POISON GAS STOCKPILED AROUND COUNTRY  </P> <P> At least 30,000 tons of lethal nerve gases and mustard gas that would be  destroyed under the terms of a proposed agreement with the Soviet Union are  stockpiled at eight sites across the country and one in the Pacific.  </P> <P> After an extensive study last year, a panel convened by the National Academy of  Sciences concluded that the best disposal option is to build an incinerator at  each of the eight sites to burn the chemicals, at a cost that the U.S. Army  says could exceed $3.5 billion. The only alternative seriously considered was  transportation of the lethal agents to one or two central sites for burning --  an option that was dismissed because of the unacceptably high risks of moving  the materials around.  </P> <P> Realistically, said chemical warfare expert Matthew Meselson of Harvard  University, incineration is the "only option" for disposing of the obsolete  chemical weapons that would be covered under the agreement. "We've been working  toward this for 15 years," he said.  </P> <P> Meselson and other researchers acknowledge that risks are involved in burning  the agents if it is not done carefully. Even the Army concedes the risks.  </P> <P> "We don't have any risk-free options," conceded Charles Baronian, technical  director of the Army's chemical demilitarization program. "All options have  fairly significant risk associated with them."  </P> <P> But the risks of not burning the agents might be even greater. Already,  according to Will Collette, national organizing director for the Citizens  Clearinghouse for Hazardous Wastes in Arlington, Va., 2% to 5% of the  containers in which the agents are now stored are leaking.  </P> <P> "Everybody involved recognizes that the Army is in a real bind," Collette said.  "It's too dangerous to leave them sitting there. It's too dangerous to move  them. The Army simply may not have any choice but to burn them."  </P> <P> Opposition to the Army's incineration plan has been arising in the communities  surrounding the storage depots, but even those groups are not opposed to the  idea of burning the chemical warfare agents -- only to the thought of burning  them in their own backyards. Most of the thrust of such groups now, Collette  said, is to ensure that the Army takes adequate safeguards in burning the  agents and that health and property rights are protected.  </P> <P> None of the storage sites are in California. The eight storage depots in the  United States are: Tooele, near Salt Lake City, Utah, 42% of the total;  Umatilla, near Pendleton, Ore., 12%; Pueblo, Colo., 10%; Pine Bluff, near  Little Rock, Ark., 12%; Newport, near Terre Haute, Ind., 4%; Aberdeen, Md., 5%;  Lexington-Bluegrass, near Richmond, Ky., 2%, and Anniston, near Huntsville,  Ala., 7%. An additional 6.6% is also stored outside the continental United  States, primarily at Johnston Island in the Pacific.  </P> <P> The incinerator at Tooele has been completed, and about 6.2 million pounds of  chemical warfare agents have been destroyed there in the past two years,  according to Army Maj. Joel Padilla. Tests of the new incinerator are scheduled  to begin at Johnston Island within two months, and incinerators are under  construction at other sites.  </P></p>

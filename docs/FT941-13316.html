			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Meat traders cut into City's power base in Smithfield feud Smithfield market's meat traders celebrated an historic electoral breakthrough yesterday in a long-running feud with their landlords, the Corporation of London. Two of their number - Mr John Brewster, chairman of Smithfield Market Tenants' Association, and Mr Peter Martinelli, head of the association's meat division - won seats on the City's general council in a by-election. They now have a firm platform to argue their case over who should pay for the Pounds 60m refurbishment of Smithfield's elderly buildings, needed to comply with European Union regulations. The dispute has now dragged on for a decade and may force a change in the City's medieval constitution. The traders say their beloved market, which has operated from at least the 12th century, might be forced to close if rent rises of between 85 per cent and 145 per cent are enforced. But more than money is at stake. The traders believe they can win several more City wards where election turnouts are normally fewer than 100, simply by establishing offices in them. In one, they believe the entire turnout at the last election came from one accountancy firm. Under its centuries-old constitution, only residents, partnerships and sole traders may vote. Large corporations which provide the city's lifeblood have no say. But the City has a contingency plan aimed at preventing the traders from 'packing' elections. It could extend the vote to limited companies, although this would need an act of parliament. Yesterday, the new councillors' first act was to summon their well-heeled colleagues for a conference, followed by a meat buffet, at Butchers' Hall near Smithfield. Mr Martinelli angrily denied the City's claim that it will be subsidising the market by Pounds 2m each year under the terms of its current offer to tenants. He said: 'Anyone can create panic in the enemy if you tell lies or make grand statements with no backup. When they show me what the subsidy is we'll make adjustments accordingly. There is no subsidy.' City officials maintained their claim: 'It is absolute nonsense to suggest that we are not offering a genuine and generous subsidy.' Picture, Page 8</p>

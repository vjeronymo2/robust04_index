Casas was arrested  yesterday in the United States and charged with spying for the  former USSR.    Casas, who was born in Colombia, and her husband, Aldrich  Ames, a high-level employee of the CIA for more than 30 years,  were arrested in the state of Virginia. They were accused of  having sold secrets to the KGB, the former Soviet secret  service, since 1985 for a total of $1.5 million.    The 41-year-old Colombian became a U.S. citizen after  marrying Ames, 52. She was a cultural attache for the Colombian  Embassy in Mexico in 1983 when she met the American.    The Colombian foreign minister said Maria del Rosario Casas  "worked at the Foreign Ministry more than ten years ago. She  was an intelligent official; she studied at Andes University,  taught at the institution, and did her job well."    Sanin added: "After that, there was no news about her."  Sanin said the U.S. Government has not yet asked Colombia for  any information about the former diplomat.    Maria del Rosario Casas' involvement in this espionage case  has caused commotion throughout Colombia, whose laws recognize  dual citizenship. She was an outstanding teacher of philosophy  and language and was taking graduate classes at Georgetown  University.    In voicing his regret over the incident, Prosecutor General  Gustavo de Greiff said that if the charges are proven, Maria del  Rosario Casas will have committed "treason against the  fatherland, which is sacred."</p>

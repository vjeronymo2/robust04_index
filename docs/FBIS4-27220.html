			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 31 KYODO -- The government's key  economic forecasting gauge surged above the boom-or-bust line of  50 percent in March for the third straight month, the Economic  Planning Agency (EPA) said Tuesday [31 May].    However, an EPA official downplayed the significance of the  latest data and pointed to the need to see statistics making up  the index in the coming months before deciding whether the  economy is getting back on the recovery path.    The index of leading indicators, designed to forecast  economic trends three to six months down the road, rose to 90.9  percent in March from a revised 54.2 percent in February.    The index was first reported at 45 percent for February. The  upward revision reflects positive figures on a backlog for  construction orders and business sentiment among small and  medium- sized companies, which were not included in preliminary  data.    In theory, the EPA considers a reading above 50 as a sign  that the economy will expand in the near future but a level  below 50 as heralding contraction.    The EPA remains cautious about painting a bright picture of  the state of the economy, though, since two other indexes  released together with the leading index contained negative  findings.    "Despite positive movements in the leading index, basic  movements in the indexes reflect the fact that the national  economy remains sluggish," the EPA said in a report.    The index of coincident indicators, a measure of the state  of  the economy, stayed above 50 percent in March for the first time  in two months, rising to 90.0 percent from a revised 30.0  percent in February.    The index of lagging indicators, which gauges the economic  performance in the recent past, fell below 50 percent for six  months in a row, staying at 28.6 percent against a preliminary  0.0 percent in February.</p>

			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / Union role stressed in work schemes Unions can have a beneficial effect on performance-related pay schemes even though most disapprove of them, says a study by Kingston University. It argues that union involvement in devising the schemes encourages more objective measures of performance, ensures effective monitoring to prevent discrimination and leads to insistence on fair appeals procedures. The survey of 61 unions and staff associations found that most disliked the use of the schemes. Just under three-quarters of unions said some of their members had experienced the schemes while nearly 40 per cent said they were 'one of the most pressing problems with which they were currently dealing'. The majority believed that the schemes did not improve management-employee relations. More than a third said they had generated a demand for union protection among employees. Two thirds of the unions said the schemes were being used by companies who wanted to 'minimise union involvement'. In spite of union opposition, only two unions - the IRSF tax officers' union and the Natfhe education union - had sought to resist the schemes by industrial action. More commonly, unions said their response had been to increase training for negotiators, improve communications with members and develop advisory services. The report says: 'The union response to PRP in many cases bears the stamp of 'managerial unionism' in which members are treated rather like consumers whose needs must be researched and then met through well-promoted union services provided by a trained and professional corps of representatives.' It adds: 'Employer preparedness to involve unions was the dominant influence on union success. The success of unions in shaping PRP is partly a product of union pushfulness. Unions which are more demanding are perhaps less likely to comply readily with management proposals and are more effective in regulating management decision-making.' The report concludes: 'It is fashionable to suggest unions must moderate their policies towards employers if they are to continue to represent their members' interests. Our findings contradict this advice and suggest that more oppositional unions may be better at wringing concessions from employers than their more moderate counterparts.'

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Text" of a letter from President Husni Mubarak to </F> President Geydar Aliyev; date not given, read by announcer]    [Text] In the name of God, the merciful, and compassionate.  President Geydar Aliyev, I have received your letter of 14  January 1994. You focused significant attention on bilateral  relations and the perspectives and opportunities for cooperation  between our two countries in various fields to benefit our  peoples. Our people have been bound together by historic and  cultural ties, which have helped [words indistinct] flourish.    Egypt contributes toward the effort made to establish a just  and durable peace in the Middle East. It also contributes to  the effort made to establish peace in the Caucasus. We regard  as our guidelines the principles that the occupation of  territories through the use of force is inadmissible, that  territorial integrity must be respected, and that international  relations must be maintained in a peaceful way and in accordance  with the UN Charter's principles and objectives.    Egypt has closely followed the dispute in Daghlyk Karabakh.  It has condemned the occupation of Azerbaijan's territory  through the use of force and called for the complete withdrawal  of Armenia's occupying forces. Egypt has outlined on various  platforms that it approves of the international effort aimed at  ending the dispute and supports the CSCE Minsk Group's  initiatives, which are in line with the UN Security Council  resolutions.    Egypt hopes that the destructive war will end and financial  resources will be channeled toward maintaining the effort to  realize economic reform. That complies with the region's  interests.    Mr. President, I am truly very happy to have been invited to  visit Azerbaijan. I am pleased to invite you to visit Egypt.  The date of the visit will be established through diplomatic  channels.    I conclude by wishing progress and happiness to Azerbaijan's  peaceful people. I also wish you sound health and happiness.</p>

			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / The monarch's assassin: Why deer culling is necessary in the Scottish Highlands WINTER'S SEVERITY bleaches the colour from the Scottish Highlands, as the heather's blaze is replaced by monochromes of snow and rock. To most, the hills are a picture of still life. To Malcolm, they are a living chessboard. Malcolm McCarthy has been a professional stalker for 30 years and is of his ilk, blending kindness with irony. He loves his deer and so culls them heavily. His employer's estate is part of a deer management programme monitored by the Red Deer Commission. This year they have to shoot 35 hinds to meet their quota. Throughout the Highlands other stalkers on other estates are already busy culling. It is a hard task. Dick Youngson, senior deer officer of the government's Red Deer Commission, has watched the deer population rise from 270,000 a decade ago to 300,000 today. According to Youngson, that is 50,000 deer too many. 'The Scottish deer population consists of 86,000 stags, 160,000 hinds and 54,000 calves. We are working closely with all the deer management groups to achieve an overall stock of 110,000 hinds, to produce an annual birth of 40,000 calves, both male and female.' The prize for this endeavour is great: the return of the original Caledonian forest. Once the open Highland hills supported a native woodland of Scots pine, birch and rowan. That environment has all but disappeared through overgrazing. The government's agency, Scottish Natural Heritage, is bent on the restoration of the woods. But this can only be achieved by controlling the deer. On this, all are agreed, though some question whether it is practicable to turn back the environmental clock hundreds of years. Others point to the 9.4m sheep close-cropping the Scottish vegetation at a cost, in tax-payers' subsidies, of Pounds 25 per hill ewe. They contest that, rather than taking drastic action against the Highlands' natural inhabitants, the red deer, we should reduce the number of their domesticated competitors. It is an attractive argument, especially for those who view the Highlands either as a sporting playground or as a natural, glorious wilderness. To the Highlander, it is neither: the hills are his livelihood. It is a precarious one. Many suspect that the subsidies will go eventually, and with them the hill-farmer's life. Until then, the sheep stay and the deer are blamed for the environmental damage. There are some politics in this. In urban Scottish offices the bitter memory of the Highland Clearances remain: the sheep are the working man's, the deer are the laird's. If there is a problem with overgrazing, the landowner must deal with it, by eradicating the deer if necessary. In the Highlands, they are more pragmatic. According to a survey by the British Association for Shooting and Conservation, field sports contribute Pounds 173m to the Scottish economy, of which deer-stalking brings in Pounds 9m. To shoot a single stag costs an average of Pounds 250 - and the estate keeps the carcass. The estates, their stalkers and ghillies, the hotels, restaurants and a plethora of other local services rely on this annual injection of visitors' cash. The Scottish stag season only lasts four months, however, and estates have to be manned year-long. The big payers, the Germans, are now looking eastwards, where the rich forests of Romania and Hungary produce huge red deer with forests of antlers. Red deer hinds, having no antlers, have no commercial value other than their meat and this barely makes enough to pay the stalker's wages. In good years, venison off the hill will fetch 70p per pound, making an average hind worth Pounds 50. Most of the venison is sold to Germany and Belgium, where the average consumer is used to eating game regularly. However, this is a fickle market. Continental prices for venison were shattered following the Chernobyl radiation fallout and the discovery that Scandinavian reindeer had grazed irradiated mosses. Commercial deer farming has also had an effect. The venison market is beginning to recover but at the moment a hill beast is fetching just 40p a pound. With the hinds producing little income and stalkers still needing to be paid, some deer forest owners have chosen to let staff go and their hind cull slide. To an extent, they can rely on nature. Deer can withstand intense cold so long as it is dry, but succumb rapidly to prolonged wet, windy weather. Having lost condition, the deer die from exposure and starvation. With this in mind, I wriggled through the snow-melt after Malcolm. Way down in the glen we had spied a small parcel of hinds feeding some 300 ft above us. We had made slow progress. A shifting breeze had threatened to carry our scent, forcing us to climb above the hinds where a steady breeze allowed an approach. Then a single hind, sensing our approach, had kept us pinned in the bottom of an icy burn. Finally, our surveyor moved off. Malcolm took the rifle from me and we slid forward for 30 yards on our stomachs. He checked the rifle, worked a round into the chamber and placed it carefully on his knapsack. Head buried, he signaled me alongside. 'The two hinds on the left. If either of them turns broadside on, shoot.' One does, and collapses. The hinds stop, unable to see or smell us and unsure as to the direction of the gunfire. A second beast turns sideways, allowing a heart shot. Already dead, its reflexes send it crashing down the hill. A third hind disappears over the brow. That, it seems, is that. We stay hidden for three minutes then walk forward to gather the beasts and inspect them. One is in good condition, the other two have sparse coats and one weighs little more than a yearling calf. These two were destined for early starvation. Sharing the carcasses between us, we begin the long drag down the hill. In a way, hind-stalking is assassin's work, with the deer unconscious of the danger and of the bullet. Yet who could deny that it is a better death, coming instantly, than the slow decline into starvation? Or that in order to pursue a green policy in managing our uplands, it is sometimes necessary to stain the snow red?</p>

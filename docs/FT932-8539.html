			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Danes deliver clear Yes to treaty: Polls show 57% back Maastricht DENMARK delivered a decisive vote in favour of the Maastricht treaty on European union last night, according to computer predictions and exit polls broadcast on Danish television. The result came as a huge relief to European Community leaders as well as to the Danish government. Last June's initial rejection of the treaty by Danish voters convulsed the EC, throwing its strategy for closer economic and political union into doubt. Computer forecasts of the final result, based on 46.7 per cent of votes counted, showed a win for the Yes campaign by 56.8 per cent to 43.2 per cent, overturning the Danish rejection of Maastricht in a previous referendum last June. The prediction was in line with exit surveys by the Gallup organisation and the AIM polling institute, published as polls closed, both of which forecast a 57 per cent to 43 per cent victory for the Yes camp. Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, the prime minister, claimed victory shortly after the first computer predictions were broadcast. 'I am happy that it is such a clear result . . . it is a very important Yes,' he said. Mr Niels Helveg Petersen, Danish foreign minister, proclaimed: 'This is good for Denmark and it is good for Europe.' Looking forward to the EC summit in Copenhagen next month, which Denmark will chair as current president of the Community, Mr Helveg Petersen said: 'Denmark can speak with greater authority.' Ms Drude Dahlerup, spokeswoman of the anti-treaty June Movement conceded defeat shortly after the first exit polls, saying: 'It's clearly a disappointment. It's a historical decision going the wrong way.' But she said the size of the No vote showed that 'the people are still divided and parliamentarians must listen to all those people who voted against the treaty.' The Danish government is expected to unveil today a package of economic measures to expand domestic demand and reform the income tax system which it was holding back until sure of a Yes vote. France, which last June had initially urged EC partners to brush aside Denmark's rejection of Maastricht, last night welcomed the subsequent Danish approval. The foreign ministry, with an eye to British ratification, said it was most important to implement Maastricht as soon as possible. Sir Leon Brittan, EC commissioner for external economic affairs, said last night: 'The Danes have decided after long and detailed analysis that, far from forcing them down the road of an overcentralised and bureaucratic union, the Maastricht treaty will strengthen the ties between European nations without threatening their identity.' Sir Leon added that the vote was as relevant to Britain as to Denmark. After Denmark, only Britain and Germany, where the treaty is being challenged in the constitutional court, have not yet ratified Maastricht. In the first Danish vote on June 2 last year, the verdict went against ratification by 50.7 per cent to 49.3 per cent, a majority of only 46,000 votes out of almost 3.3m cast. Yesterday, turnout was estimated at 85 per cent, exceeding last year's 83 per cent. With the vast majority of the Danish parliament supporting Maastricht, the country's leaders sought a way of going back to the electorate. This was secured at the Edinburgh EC summit last December when Denmark was granted opt-outs from the treaty's provisions on a unified currency, defence policy, Community-wide legal and police co-operation, and union citizenship. The Edinburgh agreement was backed by more than 90 per cent of the Danish parliament, representing seven of the eight parliamentary parties. Opponents argued it was a meaningless excuse to hold a second poll on the treaty, which itself has not been changed. Page 4 Key to unlock Community Anti-EC sentiment grows</p>

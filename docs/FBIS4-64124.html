			<p>BFN     [Text] Tallinn, May 26, BNS -- A common air space defense  system of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania may create better  chances for the three countries to become NATO members soon,  officials expect.    "If the three Baltic countries reach a common system as to  the technical and organizational level of their air space  defense, this may become a strong starting point in their  joining NATO. The NATO members have set up a common air space  defense system which strongly ties these countries with each  other," said Colonel Vello Loemaa, head of the air space defense  division at the Estonian Army Central Staff.    All three Baltic countries have joined NATO's Partnership  for  Peace plan and are working toward setting up a common  peacekeeping battalion to take part in UN operations by November  1995. Also these steps are expected to speed up movement toward  full member status in the North Atlantic Alliance.    Air space defense chiefs of the three countries at a meeting  in Lithuania's Meskuiciai air base Tuesday [24 May] signed a  protocol about starting preparations for setting up a common air  space defense system and joint training of pilots.    "We try to coordinate air space defense-related activity and  develop it with minimum expense. Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania  currently are in a rather similar situation, but develop  different contacts. We must make joint efforts to create a  common air space defense system," Loemaa told BNS.    He said the Baltics are also considering the purchase of air  space defense-related technology, including radars.    "This, of course, is a long-term program that will become a  reality only after several years. But we expect to make the  first concrete steps already this year," Loemaa said.    Lithuanian experts have estimated that setting up a  structure  to control the entire Baltic air space would take between 5 and  10 years.    Loemaa added that the defense forces of Latvia and Lithuania  are better equipped with aircraft than the forces in Estonia.    Lithuania currently operates three air bases for its air  force fleet of four Czech-made L-39 jet fighters, two L-140  transport planes received as gift from Germany, and tens of  older Soviet-made AN-2 aircraft the country uses to train its  paratroopers. Lithuania also has Soviet-made Mi-8 helicopters,  mainly used by the country's rescue service.</p>

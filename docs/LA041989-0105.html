			<p><P> April 19, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ANAHEIM TO REQUIRE SPRINKLERS IN ALL NEW HOMES, BUILDINGS  </P> <P> A sharply divided Anaheim City Council voted Tuesday night to adopt one of the  most sweeping fire ordinances in the nation, requiring sprinkler systems in all  new homes, apartments and commercial buildings.  </P> <P> The only other city with such a stringent ordinance is Scottsdale, Ariz.,  Anaheim Fire Chief Jeff Bowman said. Bowman added that San Clemente and a  handful of other California cities have sprinkler laws, but they are not as  strict.  </P> <P> "I'm very pleased and I couldn't be happier," Bowman said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'We're Disappointed'  </P> <P> Orange County's chapter of the Building Industry Assn. opposed the measure for  reasons of cost, liability and lack of consumer demand.  </P> <P> "We're disappointed," said John Withers, BIA director of government affairs.  "We don't think the council had full information."  </P> <P> The ordinance passed on a 3-2 vote, with opposing councilmen Thomas Daly and  William D. Ehrle citing costs as their major concern.  </P> <P> The Fire Department estimates the cost of sprinklers for the average new home  at $2,000. Sprinklers for a 20,000-square-foot commercial building are  estimated at up to $40,000.  </P> <P> "Young families are saving every penny to buy their own home," Daly said. "'In  the entire United States, there is no more expensive place to buy a house than  in Orange County."  </P> <P> But Councilman Irv Pickler, who voted with Mayor Fred Hunter and Councilwoman  Miriam Kaywood to pass the law, said sprinklers save lives.  </P> <P> "You can't put a value on human life," Pickler said. "That to me is more  important than anything."  </P> <P> The ordinance, which becomes law in 30 days, requires sprinkler systems for all  new commercial buildings, homes and apartments. Current city law requires them  only in commercial buildings greater than 6,000 square feet.  </P> <P> The ordinance will have little impact on new apartments in the city. More than  80% of the city's apartment complexes already have automatic sprinklers, fire  officials said, because city ordinances require builders to install the  equipment in apartments where fire trucks will have difficulty reaching the  buildings through narrow street entrances.  </P> <P> Developers of three residential projects on sprawling ranches in the East  Anaheim Hills, where about 5,500 homes and condominiums are scheduled to go up  over the next several years, apparently will not have to install sprinklers.  </P> <P> The developers -- Woodcrest Development, Presley of Southern California and the  Baldwin Building Co. -- had negotiated earlier agreements with the city  exempting their projects from any new sprinkler requirements in return for  providing other fire safety measures.  </P> <P> By law, the city can impose ordinances relating to public health and safety.  But Fire Chief Bowman said after Tuesday's vote that the city would not require  the sprinklers in the developments.  </P> <P> Franklyn R. Elfend, a representative of the developers, had estimated the cost  of installing sprinklers at $18 million. Anaheim Fire Marshall Michael Doty  dismissed that figure as "shooting too high."  </P> <P> Elfend said after the vote that he had no comment, since he believed the new  ordinance would not apply to the ranch developments.  </P></p>

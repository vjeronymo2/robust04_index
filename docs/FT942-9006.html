			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / Hope mingles with fears at troubled Lloyd's Lloyd's of London has done its best to soften the impact of its 1991 losses of Pounds 2.05bn on the Names, whose assets have traditionally supported the insurance market. Nevertheless, in spite of some encouraging signs, the figures announced yesterday provide evidence of a number of worrying trends especially in relation to the market's exposure to US asbestos and pollution claims. The identification of a substantial 'double count' in the 1991 and 1990 results is probably the most welcome news for Names - Pounds 533m of the 1991 loss and Pounds 596m of the 1990 loss has been counted twice, reducing losses for the two years from Pounds 5.4bn to Pounds 4.3bn. An estimated Pounds 268m of the 1991 'double count' has emerged on errors and omissions policies, which cover agents against legal awards for negligence. The remaining Pounds 265m has occurred on personal stop loss (a personal re-insurance policy bought by Lloyd's Names) and estate protection plans (a policy which covers the liabilities of deceased Names). Lloyd's is also holding out the prospect of further reductions as it seeks to eliminate other forms of 'double counting'. These include the losses on catastrophe re-insurance syndicates, which specialised in so-called 'spiral' business, covering the high-level risks of other Lloyd's syndicates and companies. 'We've got to get to grips with dual notification of claims,' said Mr Peter Middleton, chief executive. Other positive signs include pledges to accelerate tax recoveries and payments of stop loss policies. Lloyd's is also holding out the prospect of future rewards for Names, following increases in insurance rates. Mr David Rowland, the chairman, said recent restructuring at Lloyd's had 'resulted in a much leaner, fitter generation of surviving underwriters'. He added: 'It is encouraging to note that nearly two-thirds of the capacity in the Lloyd's of 1994 is in the hands of syndicates which made good profits in 1991.' Confidence is so great in this respect that the market is again allowing Names to borrow a percentage of profits from the current year of account - an amount equal to 3 per cent of their premium income limit - to meet past losses. Syndicate managers are also being encouraged to delay cash calls on Names. From the market's point of view, agents and underwriters can take comfort from indications that the 1991 loss will prove to be more widely spread than in recent years. Mr Rowland said this made 'the possibility of recovery easier than if it were concentrated on fewer heads'. Members of syndicates specialising in catastrophe re-insurance were hit by claims from disasters such as Hurricane Hugo in the Caribbean and the European winter storms of 1990. They faced some of the worst losses in 1989 and 1990. In 1991 the marine market, which was heavily exposed to catastrophe business in 1989 and 1990, reduced its losses for the year by about 50 per cent to Pounds 452m (Pounds 892.9m), for example. While Lloyd's may be beginning to emerge from its immediate problems, the legacy of its past involvement in the US, where syndicates were leading underwriters of liability business, still casts a shadow. An increase in reserves of Pounds 1,042m for years before 1991 - mainly from asbestos, pollution and other health-related claims - was the 'single largest factor in the result', Mr Rowland said. Lloyd's explained that claims from 'asbestos property damage', which involves property owners claiming for the cost of removing asbestos from their buildings, were 'coming in quicker than expected'. In addition, there had been a 'ballooning' of settlements on 'asbestos bodily injury', which arise when victims of asbestos-related diseases successfully sue for damages. The uncertainty over the evolution of these claims has led to a rise in the number of syndicates unable to close their accounts, with the number of 'open years of account' rising from 162 at the end of 1991 to 317 at the end of 1992 and 478 at the end of 1993. Lloyd's stresses that it is well-reserved, especially compared with US insurers, to meet these claims. It is confident that plans to establish NewCo, a re-insurance company into which all business underwritten before 1986 will be transferred, will prove to be successful. There is optimism, too, about the prospects of reforming the so-called 'superfund' laws, under which the US government can order business to clean up contaminated land sites. Names, who face cash calls of between Pounds 1.6bn and Pounds 1.7bn this year, can only hope that this optimism is well-founded.  ---------------------------------------------------------------               SECURITY UNDERLYING LLOYD'S POLICIES  ---------------------------------------------------------------                                             1993         1992                                           Pounds m     Pounds m  --------------------------------------------------------------- Premium trust funds                        19,650       16,663 Members' means                              6,467        6,377 (including Lloyd's deposits and reserves) Members' total resources                   26,117       23,040 Central fund and other assets               1,187        1,399 Total resources of Lloyd's                 27,304       24,439 Provisions current and future             (20.995)     (18,348) Total net resources                         6,309        6,091  ---------------------------------------------------------------</p>

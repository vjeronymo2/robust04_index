The North Korean nuclear issue is a  problem which we are directly concerned with, and it is a  difficult problem to solve for the world as a whole.  Fortunately, the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]  inspection team has entered Pyongyang to conduct official  inspections. In Panmunjom, a working contact is being held for  the exchange of special envoys. How do you think this problem  will be solved? If it is not solved, what measure do you think  will be necessary?    [President Kim Yong-sam] The North Korean nuclear program  should be stopped by all means. This is necessary not only for  the survival of the 70 million fellow countrymen but for peace  in Northeast Asia and the world. This is a problem directly  connected with our survival and for peace on the Korean  peninsula. Therefore, I think we should mobilize all means  possible to solve this problem.    Fortunately, the IAEA inspection has started. The working  contact for the exchange of special envoys is being held. We  cannot be too optimistic at this stage, for we have undergone  numerous critical stages in our relations with North Korea. We  cannot expect that everything will be settled smoothly. We will  have to overcome some more critical points. However, now that  North Korea is permitting the nuclear inspection, the so-called  nuclear card has left the North Korean hand. I think the  inter-Korean dialogue, therefore, has to make considerable  progress. The United States has promised us that it will not  hold the third round of high-level talks with North Korea unless  there is significant progress in the exchange of special envoys.  North Korea has also officially announced it will do so.    What is most important at the present stage is that we are  handling every matter in close cooperation with the United  States. The United States has always consulted us on their  contacts with North Korea. At times, the United States even  halted the talks with North Korea to have time to discuss  matters with us.    I think what is most important to the ROK is maintaining  such  a close cooperative system with the United States. If the  exchange of special envoys and inter-Korean dialogues proceed as  we intend and North Korea's nuclear development program is  hindered, we could promote relations with North Korea in  various areas, including the economic sector.    I think North Korea should acknowledge the fact that the ROK  is in a position to actively help it improve relations with the  United States. It would be foolish of North Korea to think that  it can discuss this issue without the ROK.    [Yi] In a recent news conference, you said that the  precondition for the exchange of special envoys is holding a  summit. You even said that you would meet with the North Korean  president when you believed it conducive to keeping North Korea  from developing nuclear weapons. When do you think it will take  place?    [Kim] It is hard to predict now. I will have to judge the  timing by watching the development for the exchange of special  envoys. [passage omitted]</p>

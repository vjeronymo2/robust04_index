			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / World Trade News: Chrysler to go to law against EC MR Robert Eaton, chairman-elect of Chrysler, warned yesterday that the US vehicle-maker planned to take legal action against the European Commission in response to the Community's decision to impose a 10 per cent duty on imports of diesel-engined Chrysler Voyager vehicles from Austria. Mr Eaton, Chrysler vice-chairman who takes over as chairman from Mr Lee Iacocca in January, said that Chrysler would also campaign in the US for duties on European car imports to be increased to 10 per cent from the present level of 2.5 per cent. The US vehicle-maker has been angered by the EC decision to impose a 10 per cent duty on Chrysler's Austrian-produced vehicles. The EC claims that the Chrysler plant in Graz has breached its rules on state subsidies to the automotive industry. The plant called Eurostar, a 50/50 joint venture between Chrysler and Steyr-Daimler-Puch, the Austrian engineering group, began production earlier this year. It is producing vehicles at the rate of around 26,000 a year (105 a day), which will be increased to 40,000 a year (165 a day) from February, when a second shift is introduced. The EC decided last week to impose the 10 per cent duty on the Chryslers but delayed implementation for two weeks until November 17 to allow the Austrian government more time to claw back Ecu100m (Pounds 80m) in state aid to the plant. Mr Eaton said that under the terms of the original deal Austrian subsidies were to amount to 33.3 per cent of the Sch5.6bn (Pounds 330m) investment in the Eurostar plant. Chrysler had agreed to allow this to be reduced to 22 per cent, but this had still not satisfied the Commission. 'I am enraged about the treatment we are getting,' said Mr Eaton in an interview in London. 'Ideally we would like the investment refunded and we will close the plant down and pull out of manufacturing in Europe.' 'I will work hard to get the same treatment for European vehicles in the US as we are getting in Europe. Raising the import duty in the US from 2.5 to 10 per cent would give us a level playing field.' Mr Eaton said that it was much more expensive to build the Chrysler vehicles in Europe than in the US. The imposition of the 10 per cent duty meant that the project 'no longer made financial sense'. Mr Gerhard Waas, an official in the Austrian Economics Ministry responsible for multilateral economic ties, said last week that the ministry believed that 'the legal grounds for a punitive tariff are insufficient - and EC competition rules are not valid here, because we are not a Community member.' Mr Waas said the EC and Austria were only a few percentage points apart on the level of allowable state subsidies. He said he believed it was still possible to reach a compromise.</p>

			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / Progress on easing air travel controls BRITISH and US transport negotiators said yesterday they had made good progress towards a further liberalisation of trans-Atlantic air travel after talks in Washington. Further progress will depend, however, on how the Clinton administration responds to a recent report from a US airline commission recommending that foreign airlines be allowed more leeway to acquire holdings in US companies. Mr John MacGregor, UK transport secretary, said after four hours of talks with his US counterpart, Mr Federico Pena, that the discussions represented 'a very important step forward'. The talks are aimed at giving airlines more freedom in deciding fares and routes. The UK government is also keen for British Airways to be allowed to complete the purchase of a 49 per cent stake in USAir. British Airways' holding has been blocked at under 25 per cent. Further talks are due in October. The two sides hope to reach agreement by April.</p>

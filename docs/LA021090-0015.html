			<p><P> February 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ETHNIC CONFLICT IN EAST BLOC  </P> <P> I think that it is very difficult for Americans to comprehend the idea of  nationalism. Our population is so diverse that the prevalent philosophy is one  of un-nationalism.  </P> <P> But when we look at events in other countries, there is a different story.  </P> <P> It is obvious that the attempt to "Sovietize" the population within the Soviet  Union did not work. To understand why this was a failure, one has to thoroughly  understand the individual histories of the 14 non-Russian countries -- not the  Russian versions of these histories.  </P> <P> The emergence of the Soviet Union did not solve the territorial problems by  examining the roots of these conflicts and offering solutions; imposition of  the Soviet system was like placing a Band-Aid over a wound which needed more  sophisticated treatment.  </P> <P> With some loosening of this oppressive system, the smoldering fires of  nationalism flared up once again. The "ghosts in the attic" are not dangerous  ghosts. Nationalism is actually a very healthy state and people should be  masters on their own territories.  </P> <P> Unlike the comments made by Alexiev, nationalism has always been on the  forefront. It did not re-emerge suddenly with glasnost and perestroika.  </P> <P> CHLOE ROSE PARKER  </P> <P> West Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD;  </P> <P> PLEA FOR MARCOS REFUSED  </P> <P> Vice President Salvador Laurel returned to the Philippines after a visit with  ailing former President Ferdinand E. Marcos and appealed to President Corazon  Aquino to let the man she succeeded die in his homeland. Aquino, however,  refused Laurel's request for a meeting, saying he should "share with the  Filipino people" the results of his visit with Marcos, a presidential statement  said. "President Aquino felt that there should be nothing secret in what Mr.  Marcos sought to convey to her," the statement said. Meanwhile, William Craig,  the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service district director in Hawaii,  visited the 71-year-old exiled leader and confirmed that he appears to be  "gravely ill."  </P></p>

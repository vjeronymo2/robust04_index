			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Ex-Eastman Kodak chief of finance joins Citicorp MR Christopher Steffen, chief financial officer at Eastman Kodak until he quit after 11 weeks because of differences with the chairman of the troubled film products company, is to join Citicorp, the biggest US bank. An announcement from the bank yesterday said that Mr Steffen would become a member of its management committee and 'concentrate on internal operations, productivity programmes, control and audit'. Mr John Reed, Citicorp's chairman, added that he expected to recommend that Mr Steffen be made a Citicorp director, and a senior executive vice-president at the bank. The move seems likely to be interpreted as an attempt by Citicorp to introduce solid industrial management experience and a fresh approach to operational controls. 'Chris brings . . . a breadth of international and modern industrial experience that will contribute significantly to our continued focus on . . . operational performance,' said Mr Reed. Mr Steffen, who was formerly chief financial officer of Honeywell, had come to Kodak with a reputation for taking tough, rapid action to improve a company's performance. His departure appeared to result from a clash with the group's chairman, Mr Kay Whitmore, over how to approach the company's problems. Mr Whitmore said at the time that Mr Steffen had left 'not because we disagreed on what needs to change, but because we could not agree on the process for making that change happen'.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovene </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Highway Construction Plans in </F> Slovenia--Project of Century"]    [Text] This year we will begin the largest investment  project in Slovenia, which some call the project of the century:  the accelerated construction of highways. According to this  plan, 318 kilometers of highways and modern roads will be  constructed by 1999, leading from the West (Koper) to the East  (Lendava), branching off in the direction of Sezana and Nova  Gorica (Italy) and Sentilj (Austria). The project should  stimulate a new investment cycle.    In July, the State Assembly ratified the transportation  agreement between the Republic of Slovenia and the European  Union [EU]. (One of six European routes between East and West,  the Barcelona-Kiev route, crosses Slovenia.) The EU agreed to  provide 150 million ECU's during the next three years. The  highway planning, construction, maintenance, and management will  be supervised by the newly established Slovene Highway Authority  (DARS), which will begin construction this year on nine  sections, including Arja Vas-Vransko, Hoce-Arja Vas, and  Sentilj-Pesnica, totaling 121 kilometers, as reported by STA  [Slovene Press Agency].</p>

			<p><P> May 21, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> A'S STEWART (8-1) CONTINUES TO WIN  </P> <P> Dave Stewart became the first pitcher in the major leagues to win eight games  for the second season in a row Saturday, working out of a first-inning jam and  holding the Boston Red Sox to six hits in 7 2/3 innings at Oakland as the  Athletics won, 6-3.  </P> <P> Dennis Eckersley, coming right back after giving up a grand slam to Dwight  Evans Friday night, got the last four outs to earn his 13th save.  </P> <P> Actually, Stewart's record isn't quite as good as it was a year ago, when he  went on to post a 21-12 record. In 1988, he won his first eight. This year, the  8-1 record is probably more of an accomplishment, mainly because Jose Canseco  has not appeared in a game, taking away a big part of the Athletics' punch.  </P> <P> While most observers realize that Stewart has become an outstanding pitcher, it  is Red Sox Manager Joe Morgan who points to an extra part of Stewart's game.  </P> <P> "It seems that in every game he pitches against us," Morgan said, "he makes at  least one great defensive play. Taking (Danny) Heep's smash and getting the  double play, that saved the game for him. He not only pitches, he does whatever  he has to, to win."  </P> <P> Mike Greenwell's single in the first inning had driven in a run, and there were  Red Sox runners on first and third with one out. Stewart speared Heep's shot up  the middle. Instead of going home, he wheeled to second to start the  inning-ending double play.  </P> <P> "That early there isn't much chance two or three runs is going to beat us,"  Stewart said. "So I'd rather try to get out of the inning than try to cut down  the run at the plate."  </P> <P> Mike Gallego and Terry Steinbach homered for the A's, and Dave Parker drove in  two runs with a pair of singles. Eckersley came in with the bases loaded in the  eighth -- the same situation as the night before -- but disposed of Rich Gedman  on a ground-out.  </P> <P> "I was anxious to get back in there after what happened last night," Eckersley  said. "I wanted it bad. I didn't sleep well after the home run."  </P> <P> Baltimore 5, Cleveland 1 -- Jeff Ballard, 8-12 with the ineffective team of  last season, is off to the best start for an Oriole pitcher since Wayne Garland  won his first eight decisions in 1976.  </P> <P> Ballard gave up four hits in 7 2/3 innings at Baltimore to improve his record  to 7-1. The key hit for the Orioles, who built a 5-0 lead, was a bases-loaded  single for Craig Worthington to make it 3-0 in the seventh. Worthington is 5  for 5 with seven runs batted in when the bases have been loaded.  </P> <P> After his fast start, Garland went on to win 20 games. Arm problems then  wrecked his career and he soon faded from the scene.  </P> <P> Detroit 2, Kansas City 1 -- The Tigers are 2-0 since Manager Sparky Anderson  was sent home for a rest.  </P> <P> Both wins at Detroit have come on ninth-inning home runs. Friday night, Lou  Whitaker hit a two-run homer. In this one, Alan Trammell led off the ninth with  his second home run.  </P> <P> For the second game in a row, Mike Henneman won it with two scoreless innings  of relief.  </P> <P> The Royals had a chance to break it open in the seventh. But Pat Tabler, who  also has a phenomenal record when batting with the bases loaded, flied out with  three runners on.  </P> <P> Toronto 11, Chicago 1 -- Ernie Whitt had four hits, including a three-run home  run, and Lloyd Moseby drove in three runs at Chicago to lead the Blue Jays.  </P> <P> Jimmy Key (5-2) allowed four hits in eight innings, including Ron Kittle's  eighth homer.  </P> <P> Minnesota 19, Texas 3 -- Randy Bush hit two home runs and tied a club record  with eight RBIs as the Twins breezed to victory at Arlington, Tex.  </P> <P> When the Rangers ran out of pitchers, infielder Jeff Kunkel pitched in the  eighth and ninth.  </P> <P> He gave up Bush's second three-run home run in the ninth.  </P> <P> Seattle 6, New York 4 -- Ken Griffey Jr. hit a three-run homer in the seventh  inning as the Mariners beat the Yankees at Seattle.  </P> <P> Reliever Steve Trout (4-2) retired all three batters he faced in the seventh  inning to get the victory, and Mike Schooler pitched the last two innings for  his 11th save.  </P> <P> Dave LaPoint (5-2) had his five-game winning streak snapped, allowing five runs  on nine hits and five walks, but Griffey connected off reliever Dale Mahorcic.  </P> <P> Rookie Bob Geren put the Yankees ahead, 4-3, in the sixth with his first major  league home run.

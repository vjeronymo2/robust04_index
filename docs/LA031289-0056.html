			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TWO KINDS OF ENGLISH RESISTANCE;  </P> <P> LORD NELSON THE IMMORTAL MEMORY BY DAVID HOWARTH AND STEPHEN HOWARTH (VIKING:  </P> <P> 1989 marks the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution. Coming at the end of  a century of French intellectual leadership and followed by an attempt,  temporarily successful, to make Europe a French empire, the Revolution well  deserves the torrent of books that will be devoted to it this year. Two of the  first of these books deal with the resistance to the Revolution: Edmund Burke,  right, in the intellectual resistance, challenging the political philosophy of  the Revolution; Horatio, Viscount Nelson in the military resistance, blocking  the advance of Napoleon.  </P> <P> In London, Horatio, Viscount Nelson's Column stands proud as any memorial to  Washington or Lincoln. His ship is enshrined and Sir Francis Drake's wasn't.  His brilliant tactics and foolish acts have become public domain through a  dozen biographies, eight volumes of letters and dispatches -- every form of  public record, in fact, save a "Masterpiece Theatre" miniseries.  </P> <P> Nelson, clearly, bequeathed himself to Britain and there should be little left  to say.  </P> <P> David and Stephen Howarth have produced a detailed, balanced chronology. It is  studious, readable and clean of emotional partialities. Their fascination is  Nelson and the creation of an icon, his toughness and frailties, not the  win-loss stats of one admiral and the pedantics of his wars at sea.  </P> <P> A reader is ever aware, and thankful for that direction and the authors' joint  standing and understanding as military historians.  </P> <P> Yet it remains just another book about Nelson that recycles the household and  schoolboy lore (at least among schoolboys in British households) of the Royal  Navy's wooden-walled glories and one officer's spanking victories at Cape St.  Vincent, the Battle of the Nile, and, in 1805, the Battle of Trafalgar.  </P> <P> Here's Nelson, one-eyed, one-armed, deserting his wife for a blatant and  international affair with married Lady Emma Hamilton. There's Nelson, during  one sea battle, placing a spyglass to his sightless eye and not seeing his  commander's recall flags. And Horatio Nelson, the split personality; an  insecure popinjay seduced by his own decorations and fame -- yet a confident,  respected iron hero at sea.  </P> <P> And exactly as much of it was reported (less the slap and tickle and  psychological interpretations) by Robert Southey in "The Life of Nelson" as  early as 1813.  </P> <P> The longevity and intensity of this public reverence for Lord Nelson is not  lost on the Howarths.  </P> <P> "No one and nothing can be remembered literally for ever," they note. "Nelson  is an unusually hard person to forget, or even to want to forget. The reasons  for remembering him have changed often with time, fashion and individuals.  </P> <P> "The idea of Nelson as martyr entered into it very quickly and grew to  Christ-like proportions . . . dying not only for his country but for its  salvation. Even in his lifetime, he was regarded by many as a national guardian  angel . . . and afterwards he became virtually a secular patron saint.  </P> <P> "Although some people felt Emma's claim that during battle, he would cry out:  'For Emma and England' was going a bit far."  </P> <P> It certainly was. On the other hand, the truths of Nelson's life were equal to  any apocrypha. By all standards of any era, he was one of the greatest heroes  and military leaders the world has ever seen.  </P> <P> He went to sea at age 12. He was a lieutenant at 18 and a captain in command of  an armed schooner at 20. Two years later he was in combat and had he lived in  our time and served this country, Nelson would have been the recipient of at  least the Medal of Honor, certainly the Distinguished Service Cross, and  definitely four Purple Hearts.  </P> <P> Although slight and short, Nelson was tough enough to fight continual sea  sickness, recurring malaria and an endless variety of paralyzing plagues and  fevers. Emotionally, he was very much the lesser man who fell for anything in  crinolines and was besotted by Lady Hamilton, the promiscuous apogee of  Nelson's vanity, arrogance and mid-life crisis.  </P> <P> And like George S. Patton Jr. he sensed a mystic guidance to his military  service. Patton believed he was the reincarnation of a commander of Roman  legions. Nelson, as a 17-year-old sailor, saw a "brilliant orb."  </P> <P> He half-believed it a light from heaven and fully believed the sudden vision as  "A glow of patriotism . . . (that) presented my king and country as my patron.  My mind exulted in the idea. Well then, I exclaimed. I will be a hero! And  confiding in Providence, I will brave every danger."  </P> <P> Thirty years later, while routing Napoleon's navy at Trafalgar, while setting  an end to war at sea for more than a century, he was hit in the chest by a  French musket ball and died below decks on his flagship "Victory."  </P> <P> At 47, he died in the arms of his officers and surrounded by his wounded men.  There was national and individual devastation sufficient to overshadow  England's final victory against the French.  </P> <P> A senior captain wrote to his wife: "On such terms it was a victory I never  wished to have witnessed."  </P> <P> A gundeck sailor wrote home in pencil and said it much better: "Our dear  Admiral Nelson is killed . . . chaps that fought like the devil sit down and  cry like a wench."  </P> <P> Shiver my timbers, Alistair, what stuff for a "Masterpiece Theatre" miniseries.  </P></p>

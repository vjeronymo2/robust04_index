			<p><P> May 11, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: OTAY MESA  </P> <P> One man was in custody Thursday after attempting to rob three uniformed San  Diego police officers about half a mile north of the border, police said.  </P> <P> The officers, members of the Border Crime Intervention Unit, were at an  observation point at Old Dairy Mart and Monument roads when they were  surrounded by three men about 11:45 p.m. Wednesday, said Bill Robinson, a San  Diego Police Department spokesman.  </P> <P> One of the men asked the officers if they had any "weed" (marijuana), Robinson  said. As they were talking, the officers noticed that one of the men, Jose  Ramirez, had a knife in his hand. Then, as the first man asked the officers for  money, the third man pulled out a gun, Robinson said.  </P> <P> The officers struggled with the men and Ramirez was taken into custody. The  other two fled south across the border. Officers seized the knife Ramirez was  holding and a .22-caliber Ruger pistol, which was dropped by the third suspect,  Robinson said.  </P> <P> Ramirez, 18, was booked on three counts of suspicion of attempted armed robbery  and was being held in lieu of $45,000 bail at County Jail downtown. Ramirez, a  native of Los Mochis in Mexico, told police he has been living in Tijuana,  Robinson said.  </P> <P> The officers -- Joe Bane, Paul Hollman and Michael Richardson -- have been with  the unit for less than a year, Robinson said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 16, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> UNION CIVIL WAR PRISON CAMP AN ALL-BUT-FORGOTTEN RELIC OF BRUTALITY  </P> <P> Like some rusty bayonet or tattered battle flag hidden away in the attic, the  Elmira prison camp is an all-but-forgotten relic of the Civil War.  </P> <P> Considering the human suffering involved, maybe memories of the prison, which  opened 125 years ago this month, are best left undisturbed.  </P> <P> Except for a flagpole, a small monument and two stone markers, there's nothing  in the quiet Elmira neighborhood where the prison camp once stood to mark its  presence. But buried beneath tidy rows of white headstones and shade trees at  the Woodlawn National Cemetery are the remains of 2,973 Confederate soldiers  who died at Elmira, many from starvation.  </P> <P> The Confederacy's Andersonville prison in Georgia is remembered as the most  infamous example of the inhumanity and deprivations of the Civil War, even  though records show that a soldier imprisoned in Elmira stood little better  chance of surviving than did one in Andersonville.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Death Camp?'  </P> <P> Questions linger over whether those 2,973 Rebels died mainly because of the  primitive state of medicine and sanitation during the Civil War, or whether  they were victims of the Lincoln Administration's retaliatory neglect of some  prisoners of war.  </P> <P> "Can one say that, by design, this was a death camp?" asked J. Michael Horigan,  an Elmira history teacher who spent much of the past year researching records  from Civil War prison camps in Washington, D.C., and in the South. "I think one  can say it, but you can't document it. The records on this camp are very  incomplete. But circumstantial evidence certainly makes it look that way."  </P> <P> Union officials ordered in May, 1864, that a complex of barracks at Elmira that  had been used for three years to house Union soldiers be converted to a prison  camp for captive Southerners. A 12-foot-high fence was immediately thrown  around a 30-acre portion of barracks.  </P> <P> There were 35 wooden buildings in the complex, each about 100 feet long and 16  feet wide. Union officers in Elmira wrote the War Department that the barracks  could accommodate 3,000 men comfortably and 1,000 more in a pinch.  </P> <P> Orders came back from Washington that 10,000 men were to be housed in the camp.  Men not lucky enough to get places in barracks would sleep in tents. Wooden  barracks weren't constructed for all the men until well after winter had set  in.  </P> <P> On July 6, 1864, a train pulled into Elmira with the first 399-man contingent  of prisoners on board.  </P> <P> It was a ragged group of prisoners. Most had been captured during the grinding  battles of the Wilderness in Virginia. Elmirans noted that their ragtag  uniforms hardly made the men look like members of the same army. Some prisoners  wore only shirts and underwear. Many had no shoes.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Grisly Beginning  </P> <P> Things went wrong at the prison camp almost from the beginning.  </P> <P> On July 15, a train loaded with 844 Confederates and 128 Union guards bound for  Elmira smashed head-on with a coal train near Shohola, Pa. Many of the wooden  cars were reduced to kindling in the accident, which killed 49 prisoners and 17  guards.  </P> <P> Five prisoners escaped during the chaos, and it took three days for some of the  wounded to receive medical treatment.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fouled Pond  </P> <P> Meanwhile, inside the camp, a peril just as lethal, although slower in its  effect, was taking shape.  </P> <P> A stagnant body of water, called Foster's Pond, was within the fences of the  prison. With so many men being sent to the camp -- there would be more than  4,400 by the end of July, and 9,600 by the end of August -- the water quickly  became fouled. The pond became a breeding ground of disease amid an extended  heat wave that summer.  </P> <P> Less than three weeks after Elmira opened, a local newspaper reported that a  "deleterious miasma" hung over the camp due to the stagnant water. One Union  surgeon called it a "festering mass of corruption."  </P> <P> Prison administrators asked the Union's commissioner general of prisoners, Col.  William Hoffman, for permission to dig canals connecting the pond with the  nearby Chemung River to allow fresher water to pass through it.  </P> <P> Approval for that project didn't come until October -- and prisoners didn't  complete the canals until Jan. 1, 1865.  </P> <P> "I think this falls into the realm of circumstantial evidence," Horigan says.  "This is what I call the politics of delay. The sluice could have been done by  August, 1864."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Disease Spread  </P> <P> In the meantime, men were dying in droves.  </P> <P> "The scurvy was among us, and as the cold weather advanced the death rate  increased rapidly," wrote prisoner L.B. Jones. "Scurvy, typhoid, pneumonia and  finally smallpox broke out to an alarming extent, carrying off great numbers of  the poor fellows."  </P> <P> Emory Thomas, a history professor at the University of Georgia, says doctors at  Elmira weren't different from those practicing elsewhere during a war in which  twice as many men died from disease than from battle-related wounds.  </P> <P> "The doctors really weren't convinced about the germ theory of disease at this  point," he said. "At this time they were dealing with very, very nuts-and-bolts  things, like how to set a fracture properly and whether chloroform would kill  and if ether was better than chloroform. These are important things, but we're  not talking about great leaps forward in medical practice."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Rations Small  </P> <P> The food at Elmira could have been another problem. Elmira prisoners after the  war said a day's rations generally included two, 1-inch-thick slices of bread,  2 ounces of meat and a pint of soup, often only the thin broth in which the  meat was cooked. Union officers insisted after the war that rations at Elmira  were more generous.  </P> <P> "I was assured by a guard that the same rations were issued to the prisoners as  to the U.S. troops stationed there," Confederate soldier Erastus Palmer  recalled after the war. "There seemed to me to be some bad leak in it before it  got to us."  </P> <P> In May, 1864, Secretary of War Edwin Stanton had ordered that prison rations to  Confederates being held in Northern camps be reduced to the same level as those  Southern troops in the field were receiving. This coincided with the Lincoln  Administration's general hardening of its treatment of Southern prisoners  starting that year as news began to filter north of the deprivations being  endured by Union soldiers at Andersonville, the Libby prison in Richmond, Va.,  and other Confederate camps.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Vindictive Man'  </P> <P> Horigan calls Stanton a "very vindictive man" who exercised virtual dictatorial  control over the Northern prison camp system.  </P> <P> "Abraham Lincoln had very little to do with any decision-making as far as the  prison-camp system was concerned," Horigan said. "One of the characteristics of  his presidency was that he (delegated) power to his Cabinet members. He gave  them an enormous amount of power and an enormous amount of leeway."  </P> <P> Many of Elmira's prisoners blamed Stanton too.  </P> <P> "It is my honest opinion that Secretary Stanton did this in retaliation,"  Virginia soldier Enos Lyons later wrote of conditions at Elmira. "Yes, men died  in Elmira prison I know from hunger and want; this in a land of plenty. I was  young and strong and determined I would not be carried out if I could help it,  but many poor prisoners lay right down and died of hunger."  </P> <P> </P> <P> More than 20% Died  </P> <P> According to figures compiled by an early-century historian of the Elmira  prison, Clay Holmes, 27% of the camp's captives died. Pulitzer Prize-winning  Civil War historian James McPherson places Elmira's mortality rate at 24%.  </P> <P> By way of comparison, 13,000, or 29%, of the 45,000 Union soldiers imprisoned  at Andersonville died.  </P> <P> For the Civil War as a whole, 15.5% of the Union soldiers imprisoned in 28  Southern camps died while in captivity and 12% of the Confederates in 24  Northern camps died.  </P> <P> Why, then, have Elmira and other Northern prisons with high death rates -- Camp  Alton, Ill.; Lookout Point, Md.; Johnson's Island, Ohio; and Rock Island, Ill.  -- escaped Andersonville's notoriety?  </P> <P> "To the extent that Elmira and others lack infamy, I would guess it has to do  with who won the war," Thomas said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Mismanagement on Both Sides  </P> <P> Andersonville's commandant, Henry Wirz, was the only soldier executed after the  Civil War as a war criminal, an act that caused lingering resentment for  decades among some Southerners who claimed that he was made a scapegoat for the  mismanagement of prison camps on both sides.  </P> <P> And the only historic site operated by the National Park Service at a former  Civil War prison camp is at Andersonville. Events including historic  re-creations, memorial services and even an archeological dig will be held  throughout this year to mark Andersonville's 125th birthday.  </P> <P> But Elmira's anniversary will pass quietly. The chances are good that most of  the people living in the well-maintained, turn-of-the-century homes around the  former site of the camp won't give the historic significance of this year a  second thought.  </P> <P> "The people in the South know Elmira," Horigan said. "They know their  granddaddy was there or whatever. And quite a few compare it to Andersonville.  I don't think they're correct in doing so. Nothing else was Andersonville.  </P> <P> "But why we only think of Andersonville when we think of Civil War prison camps  I don't know. These places were bad places, all of them were. It was  despicable, the way both the South and the Union treated their prisoners. It  was the darkest chapter of the war."  </P> <P> A Union surgeon called the camp a 'festering mass of corruption.'  </P></p>

			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / Obituary of Sir Owen Aisher: Reforming a market SIR OWEN AISHER, who died last weekend aged 93, took the small family building business he joined in 1924 and created one of the Britain's leading building materials companies: Marley. Owen Arthur Aisher was born in on May 28 1900, the eldest of six children, all of whom became involved in the family business. His father, Owen Aisher, was a plasterer by trade, but after the Boer War worked as a civilian at the army camp, where young Owen was educated. After the first world war, in which he served as a motorcycle despatch rider, Sir Owen joined the Metropolitan Police as a constable, moving in 1920 to Scotland Yard as one of the first motorcycle policemen. Weekends saw him cycling down to Harrietsham in Kent to help his father, then running a small housebuilding business. In 1924 he joined his father full-time. Like other small builders, the Aishers had been making a few concrete roof tiles on site when the traditional product was unavailable. The concrete tile had been available in the UK for 30 years, but was not popular. Within decade, the Aisher family had developed their garden-shed business into the largest roofing tile manufacturer and the largest roofing contractor in the country. Sir Owen's early selling experience determined his lifetime marketing philosophy. Traditional builders' merchants showed little interest in the new concrete tile and, throughout his career, Sir Owen maintained that the builders' merchant was no more than a provider of goods which already had a market. When he tried to sell tiles directly to builders, he found them resistant to new methods of fixing. Sir Owen's response was to offer not just the tiles but to fix the whole roof. Thus Marley's 'supply and fix' philosophy was born. By 1932 Marley had become the country's largest roofing contractor. Sir Owen had found a unique formula. He produced in volume and sold aggressively into one of Britain's most conservative industries. Sir Owen's father had been in equal partnership with Arthur Blackman, a prominent coal merchant and five times Lord Mayor of Hastings. Blackman finance was needed for the original tile factory at Harrietsham, leaving the family with only one third of the equity; the construction of two more factories diluted the Aisher interests further. The conflict of interest and personality between Sir Owen, who by 1930 was in effect running the business, and his sleeping partner nearly led to the break-up of Marley. Eventually it was agreed that the Marley companies should be sold, a process that took more than two years to complete. The Blackman interests were bought by Sir James Dunn and Dean Finance, part of British American Tobacco; the Aisher family holding was increased to around one third and Marley was floated on the London Stock Exchange in 1935. After the second world war, Sir Owen became one of the leaders in the development of plastic products for the building trade. In wartime visits to the US he had seen asphalt flooring, and he believed that there would be a post-war timber shortage leading to houses being built with concrete floors. He recognised that people would need a quality product to cover such floors. Against the advice of his non-executive directors, Marley began to build its first floor-tile factory. Production began in spring 1948 - a few months after Dunlop but ahead of Armstrong of the US. Still no more than a small company, Marley competed head-on with two much larger concerns and emerged with the largest market share. Through the use of plastics, Marley sought to widen its sphere of interest, eventually spreading as far as the motor industry. The Aishers extended the philosophy of creating their own market through the development of Payless, its merchanting and do-it-yourself retailing business. Marley tried to establish itself overseas after the war. The shape of the company's extensive overseas manufacturing interests was determined in the 1950s when the Aishers chose to develop the plastic flooring business. As a new product it was thought to provide more opportunities for Marley's supply-and-fix philosophy. In the 1950s a network of plants was developed across Europe and deep into the the southern hemisphere. During the 1970s the group began to lose its way. It suffered from capital limitations which were, to a degree, imposed by Sir Owen's desire to maintain family control. More significant was a conflict over marketing philosophies, in particular Sir Owen's commitment to supply and fix against the opposition of most of his colleagues, and Marley's position as a competitor to its own customers. The internal conflict was symptomatic of a management structure rooted in a successful family business and unable to come to terms with the passing of the years. Interviewed by Building magazine in 1978, Sir Owen stated forcefully his views on the role of the family. 'One of the things we older people deplore is a lack of family. The invention of the word nepotism is all part of the academic idea of denigrating family. In other words, if you work for your family and create a job for your son, they suggest it's wrong . . . We look after ourselves first, on the basis that if we're strong and healthy, we can do something for the other fellow.' Sir Owen stood down as chairman of Marley in October 1982, becoming life president. There had been a difficult annual general meeting earlier in the year and pressure was growing, both from inside the company and from the City. Although he remained a director, Sir Owen no longer attended board meetings. Shortly after he retired as chairman, he sold the majority of his Marley shareholding.</p>

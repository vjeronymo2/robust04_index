			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / Company News (This Week): Return to the black after the dark years - Philips On Thursday, long-suffering shareholders in Philips, the Dutch electronics group, will find out whether they can expect to receive a dividend this year  -for the first time since the company fell into difficulties in 1990 and embarked on its 'Centurion' restructuring programme. An immediate resumption of the Fl 2.00 per share paid out of 1989 profits will not be possible, but there may be room for around Fl 0.50. Philips will certainly report a profit, with the help of a Fl 1.1bn (Pounds 383m) gain on the sale of its 35 per cent stake in Matsushita Electronics Corp, a joint venture with Matsushita of Japan. This will more than reverse the previous year's net loss of Fl 900m. Even without one-off items, Philips is expected to post a net profit of Fl 500m-Fl 850m. Much will depend on whether Christmas shoppers stocked up on consumer electronics products. That division is expected to have remained loss-making in 1993, although break-even is in sight. A big question is how many consumers have been tempted to buy two new offerings: the digital compact cassette (DCC) and compact disc-interactive, a multi-media version of the CD player. Philips should be aided by robust results from PolyGram, its 75 per cent-owned music and film company, reporting in London today.</p>

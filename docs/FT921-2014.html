			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Bush may be warming to Rio's Earth Summit: The US could change its mind and back plans for a global environmental charter THERE are signs that President George Bush may be ready to give way to international pressure to put his weight behind the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in June. Mr Bush has so far resisted appeals at home and abroad for the administration to sign up to an international charter at the summit to protect the global environment. Alone among industrialised countries, the US has baulked at signing an agreement, a centrepiece of the Earth Summit, that would commit it to limit carbon dioxide emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000. The administration has been arguing there are so many unanswered questions about global warming that the US must proceed with caution. But it may have little choice about changing its position. Legislation is being drawn up by the House of Representatives sub-committee on health and the environment that would mandate a curb in emissions to 1990 levels. The bill is likely to attract sufficient support for passage, particularly with an election looming. After testifying this week before the sub-committee, Dr Daniel Lashof, a senior scientist at the Natural Resources Defence Council, said the administration now was 'considering whether to change its position based on internal government analyses.' These analyses, including one by Mr Lashof and his colleagues, conclude that the US could meet the goals being pressed by the European Community and other allies by implementing some of the measures endorsed by the administration last month at the last round of climate treaty negotiations in New York in preparation for the June summit. At the sub-committee hearing, Congressman Henry Waxman, its chairman, said on the basis of latest evidence from the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Academy of Science and others, the US could stabilise carbon dioxide emissions at 1990 levels 'at little or no cost.' 'The central questions that scientists are debating now concern how much warming and how quickly,' said Mr Waxman. 'But there is little question that warming will occur.' Scientists predict that the long-term effects of global warming include a dramatic decline in the world's agriculture productivity, increased spread of infectious disease, flooding of coastal areas and wetlands, inundation of drinking water supplies and devastation of many of the planet's natural ecosystems. US and EC representatives are scheduled to take the issue up again in Paris on April 13. The last round of international negotiations are set to begin in New York on April 30. While there is a vocal green lobby in the US, particularly among young voters, as an election issue it has been obscured by worries about the US economy. Recessionary pressures have lent greater weight to the argument of US business and industry that 'ill-considered policy responses' could damage US competitiveness. In testimony to Congress last Thursday, Mr Richard Briggs, vice-chairman of the Global Climate Coalition, warned that overall measures to sharply reduce greenhouse gas emissions could impose 'massive costs' on the US economy - as much as Dollars 95bn a year, according to one study. Mr Briggs contended that few of the 'so-called commitments' by other countries to curb carbon dioxide are 'meaningful' because they are not supported by binding obligations under the laws and regulations of those countries. 'Several industrialised countries have suggested that policies address only carbon dioxide, and thus ignore methane and other greenhouse gases,' he said. 'To focus solely on carbon dioxide emissions is to ignore up to half of the potential impact of greenhouse gas emissions.' The administration is under great pressure to abandon its opposition to the climate change treaty. All five current and former Democratic presidential candidates agreed to urge the president to attend the Rio summit and to demonstrate US leadership on global warming. The international community is worried that the summit will fall flat if Mr Bush is not there. Mr Bush is hardly likely to go unless he intends to sign up for concrete action. But he will lose any hope of passing himself off as 'the environmental president' unless he makes it to Rio in June.</p>

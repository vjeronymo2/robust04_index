			<p><P> May 10, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAYOR SAYS HE EXPECTS COMPLETE EXONERATION;  </P> <P> BRADLEY INTENTIONALLY REFUSING TO DEFEND HIS FINANCIAL DEALINGS, INSTEAD  RELYING ON PROBES  </P> <P> Facing what he acknowledged as the toughest test of his career, Mayor Tom  Bradley said Tuesday that he has intentionally embarked on the politically  dangerous tactic of refusing to defend his controversial financial transactions  in the expectation that he will be exonerated by the formal investigations now  under way.  </P> <P> But while Bradley portrayed the city and himself as moving steadily ahead  despite the state of crisis, the toll of the mounting debate over his behavior  was clear.  </P> <P> Asked, for example, what he hoped to accomplish in the remainder of his  four-year elective term, the mayor replied: "A speedy conclusion of this  inquiry."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Supports Hahn Investigation  </P> <P> Referring to the burgeoning controversy over his finances during a luncheon  with Times reporters and editors, Bradley said he objects to private calls by  high-ranking city officials for appointment of an independent counsel to  investigate the case. He said he fully supports the inquiry now under way by  City Atty. James K. Hahn.  </P> <P> Despite his self-invoked silence, however, Bradley also illuminated aspects of  his financial history and his views on the furor that has cast a shadow over  his 16-year tenure as the city's political leader and provoked unprecedented  questioning at City Hall.  </P> <P>  -- Bradley acknowledged that he has stock accounts at Drexel Burnham Lambert  and other investment firms, but said he had never discussed transactions with  Drexel's former junk bond chief, Michael Milken, a prominent Bradley supporter  who is under indictment for insider trading and securities violations. Bradley  also said he did not consider it a conflict of interest to take mayoral actions  benefitting the firm that held his personal accounts.  </P> <P>  -- The mayor held firmly to his position that he did not involve himself in  conflicts of interest with regard to his holdings. He said he did not consider  it a mistake to have taken money to act as an adviser to local financial  institutions while serving as mayor.  </P> <P> But if he could relive events, Bradley said, he would have shown "even greater  caution than I felt I had exhibited."  </P> <P>  -- The mayor added that throughout his administration he has relied on  himself, and not on the city attorney, to determine whether specific  circumstances pose conflict-of-interest problems. Likewise, he said, he alone  made the decision to refuse to discuss specifics about the pending  investigations. But he said that move came not because his attorneys asked him  to remain silent but because he does not believe that his side will receive an  accurate airing.  </P> <P> Bradley insisted that he has "the perfect answer" to the myriad and persistent  questions raised about his personal finances, but he refused to give it.  </P> <P> "The truth as I see it will come out," Bradley said.  </P> <P> In more than one hour of give-and-take, Bradley also sought to downplay the  potential political impact of lengthy investigations on what has been perceived  as a career marked by personal integrity. Bradley's refusal to answer questions  about his finances has raised eyebrows even among long-time defenders, and the  mayor acknowledged the potential danger of his strategy.  </P> <P> "I made the judgment I made, right or wrong," he said. "Whether it is harmful  or helpful, time will tell."  </P> <P> The mayor said he does not expect ambitious City Council members to "look for  ways of trying to attack me personally," but he asserted that he will  aggressively press his agenda in disputes with the council over the city's  upcoming budget. A battle over the budget, centered on conflicting approaches  backed by Bradley and the council's Finance Committee chairman, Zev  Yaroslavsky, looms next week.  </P> <P> "I will not back away," the mayor vowed.  </P> <P> Only weeks after he won an unprecedented fifth term as mayor, Bradley faces  three separate investigations. City Atty. Hahn's inquiry, which is expected to  continue for months, centers on Bradley's financial relationships with two  local institutions. Far East National Bank last year awarded Bradley $18,000 to  serve as the only paid member of its advisory board. The second firm, Valley  Federal Savings &amp; Loan, paid Bradley up to $24,000 a year since 1978 to  serve as a director.  </P> <P> Bradley initially denied knowing that the firms were active with the city, but  documents released in recent weeks have indicated that Bradley knew that Far  East held city accounts. Bradley also approved city measures affecting Valley  Federal subsidiaries before he left the board earlier this year.  </P> <P> The mayor also faces inquiries by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which  is looking into his investments with Drexel Burnham Lambert, and the Fair  Political Practices Commission, which has launched two investigations of the  mayor.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Not Taking His Time  </P> <P> Bradley said he has not yet been questioned by Hahn's aides, but said members  of his staff have been interviewed in recent days. The investigation, he said,  is taking "practically none" of his time.  </P> <P> The mayor's own attorneys, Bradley indicated, have yet to receive a full  package of materials relating to his financial transactions.  </P> <P> "I don't know that they have all that," he said. " . . . When they're ready,  they will get anything of that nature that they want."  </P> <P> Bradley turned aside private suggestions by council members that the  investigation be taken over by an independent lawyer. Council members are known  to question the breadth of Hahn's investigation and have expressed concerns  that it will not be forceful enough.  </P> <P> "The city attorney is independently elected, he's answerable to the people, not  to the mayor or to the City Council," Bradley said. " . . . He is the  appropriate person to conduct such an inquiry."  </P> <P> The mayor swatted down Councilman Michael Woo's current consideration of  recommending appointment of a special counsel. "I don't know that Mr. Woo  carefully thought it through," Bradley declared brusquely. "I don't know that  anybody has given him legal advice on it."  </P> <P> "I for one want to get the thing over," he added. "And I certainly would not  want to have at this point of the game, after the city attorney has conducted  as much of the inquiry as he can, somebody else . . . brought in to carry on  and duplicate all that he has done."  </P> <P> The mayor also said that he has launched his own informal inquiry into the  activities of his business associates, but he said he had turned up no  information pertinent to his case.  </P> <P> While he refused to delve into specifics about his ties to Far East and Valley  Federal, Bradley on Tuesday did defend the general notion of working for  outside concerns while serving as mayor.  </P> <P> "I don't see it as a big prohibition," he said. "It's a question of what you do  in that position."  </P> <P> Documents related to the case have indicated that Bradley both approved  measures relating to his business contacts, and, in his dealings with city  officials, spoke about them. But he defended the overall practice of speaking  for his allies.  </P> <P> "I was there as a service agent," he said, referring to his mayoral role.  </P> <P> The mayor, citing his self-imposed ban on specifics, refused even to concur  with City Treasurer Leonard Rittenberg's statement that Bradley, in discussing  Far East with Rittenberg, had not applied untoward pressure to deposit city  accounts in the bank.  </P> <P> "I have the perfect answer. Let me just leave it at that," Bradley said.  Pressed on whether Rittenberg's comment was "the perfect answer," the mayor  replied: "It's one of the perfect answers."  </P> <P> Offering more detail than he has in the past about his financial holdings,  Bradley said that he has had "several accounts" at Drexel Burnham and other  brokerages, but insisted that controversial junk bond chief Milken did not, to  Bradley's knowledge, involve himself in the mayor's portfolio.  </P> <P> "I don't ever recall talking to Michael Milken about stock," the mayor said. "I  don't recall ever talking to him about any stock."  </P> <P> The mayor said he was also "not aware" that he had ever been allowed to  purchase stock that was not available to the general public.  </P> <P> Bradley also indicated that he had no records specifying the dates of his stock  purchases and sales, although records such as that are required by the Internal  Revenue Service. The mayor had previously promised to make the dates available  to Times reporters if he could determine them.  </P> <P> Asked whether he had considered it a conflict of interest to weigh in on  matters involving Drexel while having accounts with the firm, the mayor replied  simply: "No." Drexel officials have said that the mayor intervened at their  behest when SEC officials were considering shifting the firm's junk bond  accounts out of the Beverly Hills office. Bradley called Rep. Tony Coelho  (D-Merced) and asked him to lobby for the firm's continued presence in Beverly  Hills, officials said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Shows Some Impatience  </P> <P> Despite his decision not to speak openly about his side of the case, Bradley  indicated a certain impatience with the recent turn of events and what is  expected to be months of investigations into his administration.  </P> <P> "If there is any No. 1 thing that I'm most proud of, it is that record of  honest integrity, prudent management of the city," he said. "And that's the  reason that I have been pained and concerned about the . . . press coverage  that has taken place in the last several weeks.  </P> <P> "As soon as that inquiry is finished, I'll be prepared to talk to the whole  world, and nobody could want it to be finished faster and more fully than I,  because I'm the one who's had to suffer the battering."  </P></p>

			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Owners Abroad postpones EGM Owners Abroad has postponed the extraordinary meeting at which its shareholders were to vote on a tie-up with Thomas Cook, the travel agency group, writes Richard Gourlay. The EGM will now be held on March 22, a week after the closing date of the hostile bid from Airtours, the rival holiday company. Mr David Crossland, Airtours chairman, welcomed the postponement of Owners Abroad's EGM. 'Now Owners shareholders can concentrate on what matters,' he said. 'Airtours' offer is significantly higher than the 100p a share at which Owners are planning their ill-conceived tie-up.'</p>

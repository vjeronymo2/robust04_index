			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 9. USFWS and NMFS have expressed concern that special measures may be necessary to protect Delta smelt in the event of a late spawn. In particular, these agencies have suggested that if real-time monitoring indicates that peak Delta smelt spawning occurs in late June or July, it might be appropriate to maintain the 2 ppt isohaline in Suisun Bay during those months to assure that juveniles remain in the suitable rearing habitat in eastern Suisun Bay.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is soliciting comment as to whether and how these measures should be incorporated into water quality criteria, and on the operational impacts of such criteria. In addition, EPA requests comment on how implementation of these criteria would affect carryover storage requirements presently imposed on water projects for the benefit of the threatened winter-run Chinook salmon.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. EPA is proposing salmon smolt survival criteria to protect the Cold Fresh-Water Habitat and Fish Migration designated uses. These criteria would address EPA's concerns with certain temperature criteria contained in the 1991 Bay/Delta Plan that were disapproved by EPA. As explained in more detail above, the Agency believes that it presently has an inadequate basis to propose temperature criteria. Further, the adoption of salmon smolt criteria provides the State with more flexibility in determining an implementation plan protecting the fisheries use.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is soliciting comment as to whether an adequate scientific basis exists to propose a temperature criteria alone. The Agency is especially interested in receiving comment as to whether a temperature criteria would provide better protection for the designated uses than the proposed criteria, and whether a temperature criteria could be implemented given the present operational flexibility in the estuary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11. EPA welcomes any additional information on the effectiveness and feasibility of installing a barrier to fish (including a sound barrier) at the head of Georgiana Slough. Results from USFWS coded-wire salmon smolt experiments clearly demonstrate that migrating smolts survive poorly in the central Delta, and salmon smolt survival would be higher if fish migrated down the main Sacramento River channel. Closure of Georgiana Slough is one of the implementation measures that the Delta Team of the Five Agency Chinook Salmon Committee evaluated and recommended as a measure to increase salmon smolt survival, and survival indices recommended by the fisheries agencies included this measure. The major concerns over Georgiana Slough closure are: exacerbation of the reverse flow situation in the lower San Joaquin River, degradation of water quality conditions in the Central Delta, and blocking of upstream migration of adult salmon. It is likely that reverse flows would become less of a problem with a barrier in place in Georgiana Slough if exports were balanced with San Joaquin River flows to continue to provide positive flows in the lower San Joaquin. EPA would like more information on whether a balance could be achieved to provide some periods of time when a Georgiana Slough barrier would be beneficial for salmon without causing detrimental effects on the other species and habitats in the Delta. Since EPA's proposed salmon smolt survival index is a criteria to protect the outmigration of smolts, and Georgiana Slough closure is a measure that would be beneficial for outmigrating salmon, EPA solicits comments on whether the target index values in its proposal should be changed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12. As explained in more detail above, EPA has based its proposed index values for the salmon smolt survival criteria for the San Joaquin River on recommendations by the USFWS, NMFS and California DFG at the State Board's Interim Water Rights Hearings for the San Francisco Bay/Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta Estuary. These recommendations include placing a barrier at the head of Old River during migration of San Joaquin River system smolts through the Delta (April 1 until May 31). The Old River barrier was also recommended by the Delta Team of the Five Agency Chinook Salmon Committee, and is one of the projects called for in the CVP Improvement Act. However, discussions with USWFS and NMFS carried out during EPA's consultations under the ESA have raised questions about whether the barrier would adversely affect reverse flows in the central Delta under certain conditions. EPA is therefore requesting comment on the following issues:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Would the proposed salmon smolt criteria index values on the San Joaquin need to be revised if the Old River barrier is not built? In what ways?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Should EPA promulgate alternative or additional criteria that would be effective in the event that the Old River barrier is not constructed?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 13. In addition to a barrier at the head of Old River, the USFWS implementation recommendations for the San Joaquin also included certain export limits and flow requirements during peak migration periods. Export limits are also an important measure for achieving protection for migrating smolts on the Sacramento River system, especially if there is no barrier in place at Georgiana Slough, and are an element of the models used to generate the salmon smolt survival indices on the Sacramento River. EPA is concerned that there may be implementation scenarios for the two rivers that could result in detrimental conditions for migrating smolts even if the proposed index values are achieved. One such possible scenario may occur if the State Board adopts USFWS implementation recommendations on the Sacramento River (adjusted, as described above, to account for Georgiana Slough remaining open), but then operates the San Joaquin River so as to just meet the proposed index values. In this case, our preliminary review indicates that the San Joaquin River index value theoretically might be attained with lower flows than are protective for the salmon resources. The USFWS has substantial evidence that San Joaquin River flows are a critical element for successful smolt migration. Protection of migration for these runs is particularly important considering the low abundances and poor conditions in the San Joaquin system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The discussion above raises the possibility that the salmon smolt criteria for the San Joaquin River system may need to be refined. We are therefore requesting comment as to whether the proposed index values should be revised to reflect the interrelation between Sacramento River and San Joaquin River implementation measures recommended by USFWS. In particular, should the proposed index values be revised to account for the possible effects of low flow scenarios on the San Joaquin River?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

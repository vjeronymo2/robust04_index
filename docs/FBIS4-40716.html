			<p>BFN     [Text] If a former USSR republic is ready to set up a  confederation or even a union, Russia will unequivocally support  it, the Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev declared at a session of  the Council on Foreign Policy in Moscow Thursday.    In his opinion, the idea suggested by Kazakhstan's President  Nursultan Nazarbayev to set up a Eurasian alliance "should focus  on current CIS integration difficulties rather than distract  attention from them."    He said it was good that the process of separation in the  former USSR proceeded peacefully. "Fortunately, Russia had  enough strength to avoid confrontation and bloodshed. Now, it  is necessary to advance towards setting up a real commonwealth  rather than a neutral community, a commonwealth where all its  members be respected as sovereign and independent republics," he  said.    Speaking about Russia's peace-keeping efforts in CIS states,  Kozyrev regretted the absence of appropriate legislation for  that.    "Regrettably, our new parliament has no time for such  legislation. It finds it more exciting to discuss North Korea's  nuclear program. The impression is that our members of  parliament work on the principle that our chief concern is that  there should not be another Pol Pot," Kozyrev said.    He voiced puzzlement at the fact that the Federation Council  is not ready to sanction a Russian peace-keeping operation in  Abkhazia. "Whenever there is a vacuum, it is always filled. If  not Russia, some other country will come to that region, and  that will hardly be in Russia's interests," Kozyrev said.</p>

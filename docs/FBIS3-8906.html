			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 16 Mar (TANJUG) -- Special Russian envoy  Vitaliy Churkin today said in Belgrade, following his talks with  Radovan Karadzic, president of the Serb republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, that he believed that Karadzic had fulfilled  his promise given in Moscow to open Tuzla airport.    Churkin noted that Karadzic had given this promise under two  conditions: the presence of Russian military observers, which  -- in his words -- was possible to organize within 48 hours, and  the presence of Serb liaison officers, which was an element in  the initial UN document on opening Tuzla airport.    The Russian envoy stressed that the other side did not  accept  the presence of Serb liaison officers at this airport but he  nevertheless said he hoped other participants would continue  negotiations with the Muslim government on this issue since this  was a very important humanitarian issue.    We also agreed that in seeking a political solution for  Bosnia-Herzegovina one should take account of the interests and  sovereign rights of all three constituent peoples, he stressed.  We agreed that there were ways of stimulating the difficult  negotiating process, the Russian special envoy added.    Karadzic said that today's meeting was one in a series of  working meetings characterized by a high degree of understanding  and that he was satisfied with the fact that it had been stated  in clear terms that the Serbs should have the same sovereign  rights as the Muslims and Croats in Bosnia. The Serb side is  trying to adjust its interests to the situation as we are  determined to contribute to a final solution, particularly  peace, Karadzic said. He stressed that the Serbs in Bosnia have  a need for special relations with Yugoslavia. We must seek  solutions within this framework, Karadzic said in conclusion.</p>

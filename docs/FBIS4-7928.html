			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, April 7 (CTK) -- Czech Prime Minister  Vaclav Klaus' Moscow visit marks the collapse of the exclusively  pro-Western economic strategy which the Czech Republic  originally declared, Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia  (KSCM) spokeswoman Vera Zezulkova told journalists today.    She said that Klaus' visit to Moscow on April 4-5 clearly  showed that the premier had to "strongly reassess his initial  stands," although outwardly Klaus acted in Moscow sovereignly  and with self- confidence and even with the attitude of a  Western and successfully developing country which could teach  its less advanced neighbor how economic reform should be carried  out.    What is essential, however, is that Klaus has came to  realize  at last that Czech Republic's economy cannot do without the  Russian markets which it had light-heartedly abandoned, and  without Russian raw materials, she said. The communists  therefore perceived Klaus' Moscow talks not so much as a triumph  of the Czech economy but rather as Klaus' and his government's  victory over themselves, she added.    To present Klaus' Moscow talks to the public as a move  towards a successful completion of an agreement on the repayment  of Russian debts towards the Czech Republic is merely a  concealing maneuver, Zezulkova said, adding that the KSCM was  apprehensive about the Russian repayments of the debt being used  to "fill the holes" in the Czech state budget.    KSCM economic expert Jiri Dolejs said that not only Russians  should be blamed for Czech claims towards Russia in the two  countries' post-November 1989 trade. He said this was also  caused by the Czech Republic's deliberate cutting off all its  former trade ties and by a new division of Europe. The new  division of Europe is not merely the invention of Russian ultra  nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky, Dolejs said.</p>

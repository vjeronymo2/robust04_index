			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [BTA headlines: "Socialist Leader Videnov: "Yugo-Sanctions </F> Proved Utterly Ineffective and Hit Harder Serbia and  Montenegro's Neighbours"]    [Text] Sofia, April 19 (BTA) -- Zhan Videnov, leader of  the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), said he is supportive of  the idea of an all-Balkan initiative to lift UN sanctions  against rump Yugoslavia, speaking to the press after a regular  BSP news conference today. In his view, the Balkan countries  should call for a change in the status quo but not for a  complete and sharp lifting of the sanctions as suggested by  Serbia and Greece. "It is not proper to claim that the Balkan  countries or Bulgaria are ready to tolerate indefinitely the  current state of affairs, linking it to a so far unclear  positive effect on the peace process in the former Yugoslavia,"  Videnov said. He believes that "Bulgaria cannot uphold a view  that in April 1994 the embargo is a strong peace factor in the  Balkans." He said he objected to Bulgaria's positive official  view on the embargo rather than to its commitment to enforce it.  During his unofficial visit to Bulgaria on Sunday, Vladislav  Jovanovic, foreign minister of Serbia and Montenegro, also  called for the lifting of the sanctions as "a road to the  peaceful settlement of the Yugo-conflict." After his meeting  with Jovanovic, Bulgaria's Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov  said Bulgaria would continue enforcing the sanctions despite the  great damage it has suffered.    Zhan Videnov believes that the sanctions could be lifted  partly by allowing transit transport across Serbia and  Montenegro, to which the international community has become  reconciled according to him. This has not materialized because  Bulgaria has not been importunate, so the embargo has cost it  several billion dollars, Videnov said. According to him, the  United Nations should take a decision at last to grant passage  to escorted Bulgarian convoys through Serbia and Montenegro.  Videnov drew an analogy between this and the decision taken by  Bulgarian Parliament last Friday to allow UN equipment granted  by the U.S. Government to cross Bulgaria into Macedonia, where  it will be used by the UN Protection Force. The BSP voted  against, arguing that Bulgaria had clearly declared itself in  favour of non-involvement in the conflict in the former  Yugoslavia. The other parliamentary forces, President Zhelyu  Zhelev and the government stated that granting the convoy a  single passage would contribute to Macedonia's security, and  therefore to Bulgaria's security, and would not run counter to  the basic principles of Bulgaria's Balkan policy.    The Socialist leader assumes that the UN blue helmets in  Macedonia are the prelude to U.S. military bases on its  territory. "The whole affair is under the UN aegis but  genetically it is not related to the UN," Videnov said.  According to him, Macedonia has the sovereign right to decide  together with the United States or any other country how to  guarantee its national security. "What worries me is the  likelihood of revival of the logic of cordons, blocs and axes in  the Balkans, the likelihood of keeping the peace in the Balkans  through foreposts of great powers or military alliances," the  socialist leader said.</p>

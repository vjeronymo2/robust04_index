			<p>BFN     [Text] Brasilia, 22 Jun (EFE) -- The Brazilian Government  has proposed to the four member countries of the Common Market  of the South, Mercosur, -- Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and  Uruguay -- a common external tariff below 20 percent for  informatics and telecommunications products as of 2001.    Brazilian Ambassador Jose Arturo De Medeiros on 22 June told  EFE that Brazil, which wants to protect its informatics  industry, is willing to reduce its import tariffs, which  currently are at 35 percent, to below 20 percent by 2001.    De Medeiros, a professional diplomat, is a member of the  Brazilian delegation negotiating with the other Mercosur member  countries on the common external tariffs Mercosur will impose on  imports as of 1 January 1995, when Mercosur becomes a free trade  zone.    The technical negotiations over a common external tariff,  which should be ready by 15 July when the presidents of the  Mercosur member countries meet in Buenos Aires, have agreed on  almost 85 percent of products. The negotiations have,  nonetheless, been paralyzed over vital subjects like  petrochemical and especially informatics and telecommunications  products.    With the new proposal presented 17 June during a technical  meeting in Buenos Aires, Brazil expects the negotiations to make  considerable progress and finish in three weeks.    According to the Brazilian proposal that apparently was  viewed with interest by the other member countries'  representatives, Brazil will reduce its import tariffs on  informatics and telecommunications equipment until reaching a  rate below 20 percent in 2001, which is the maximum allowed by  Mercosur.    According to the same proposal, Argentina, Paraguay, and  Uruguay -- which import informatics and telecommunications  equipment with minimum import tariffs (Argentina imports these  products with a zero tariff) -- will increase their tariffs  until meeting the same level of Brazilian tariffs in 2001.    The Brazilian proposal, if accepted by its partners, will  allow the negotiations over the common external tariff to  conclude on time, but making an exception for capital,  informatics, and telecommunications products.    Free trade and a common external tariff for 90 percent of  products will be established among the four member countries as  of 1995 and until 2001, the year when the exceptions will end  and the common external tariff will be the same for all products  for the four member countries.    Brazilian insistence on protecting its informatics industry  had forced the Mercosur negotiators to declare that the tariffs  among the four member countries would be the same only by 2006  and that it would be very difficult to reach an agreement in the  informatics and telecommunications field.    According to the newspaper GAZETA MERCANTIL, the new  Brazilian proposal was possible thanks to a concession granted  by the national industry after a government request.    Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay must give an answer to the  Brazilian proposal next week when the technical negotiators meet  in Montevideo.</p>

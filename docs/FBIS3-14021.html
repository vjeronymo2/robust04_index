			<p>Language: <F P=105> Urdu </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Occupied Kashmir--Indian Republic Day or Black </F> Day?"]    [Text] India observed its Republic Day the other day with  pomp and pageantry, publicly displaying for the first time its  devastating Prithvi missile and demonstrating its might to  Pakistan and other neighboring countries. The steps taken by  India, such as the use of closed-circuit televisions, to deal  with any possible danger on that day in various cities,  particularly in occupied Kashmir, indicate that the Indian  authorities were driven by an unknown fear that prompted them to  show off their military might and declare their desire for  supremacy. The way the Kashmiri mojahedin shattered the Indian  troops' tight security steps by firing volleys of missiles and  rockets on Srinagar and targeting 30 military camps testifies to  the fact that India, despite all its oppressive strength and  repressive machinations, could not dampen the morale of the  highly-spirited fighters of the independence movement in Kashmir  who are fully capable of making their existence felt wherever  and whenever they like. The fleeing of Indian security forces  and even the adviser to the Kashmir governor in the face of the  mojahedin's unrelenting barrage of missiles on Bakhshi Stadium  prove that India is maintaining its hold on Kashmir only with  the help of its oppressive measures. Every individual, even a  child, in Kashmir detests India and aspires to get rid of its  clutches. Turning Indian Republic Day into a Black Day in  occupied Kashmir is in fact a message to the United Nations and  a call to Western countries to ignore their selfish interests  and rid the Kashmiris of Indian domination. Otherwise, the  people of Kashmir will smash this yoke and chain of slavery  themselves.  *</p>

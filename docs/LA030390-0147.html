			<p><P> March 3, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY COLLEGE REGIONAL MEN'S BASKETBALL;  </P> <P> THREE COUNTY TEAMS HAVE A SHOT AT STATE FINAL EIGHT  </P> <P> The basketball coaches in the Orange Empire Conference have contended for the  past few years that the conference is the best in Southern California.  </P> <P> The point was made stronger when five of the seven members reached the Southern  California regional playoffs, which started a week ago.  </P> <P> Three of those teams -- Cypress, Rancho Santiago and Golden West -- can reach  the final eight in the state.  </P> <P> In the four Southern California regional finals at 7:30 tonight, Cypress plays  host to El Camino, Glendale is at Rancho Santiago, Moorpark at Golden West and  Compton is at Antelope Valley. The winners will advance along with the four  winners from Northern California to the quarterfinals at UC Irvine, March 8-10.  </P> <P> A look at tonight's games:  </P> <P> El Camino (22-10) at Cypress (28-3) -- Cypress Coach Don Johnson got his 500th  victory when the Chargers defeated Oxnard in the second round Wednesday. This  will be the second time the teams have met this season. The Chargers defeated  El Camino, 70-49, in December.  </P> <P> El Camino struggled in the South Coast Conference to a fourth-place finish, but  has been impressive in the playoffs. The Warriors, seeded 23rd, upset No. 10  Santa Monica, 81-79, last Saturday, then upset No. 7 Los Angeles City, 97-90,  Wednesday.  </P> <P> Glendale (24-11) at Rancho Santiago (28-3) -- Rancho Santiago, the third-seeded  team, breezed by Los Angeles Harbor, 105-68, in the second round. The same  night, Glendale upset Cerritos, 71-63. Cerritos was the sixth-seeded team and  the defending state champion.  </P> <P> Glendale has been up and down this season, but did defeat Cypress, 68-55, in  December.  </P> <P> Rancho Santiago is much taller across the front with Matt Lien (6-feet-9),  Corie Blount (6-4) and Gene Altamirano (6-4). Glendale's tallest starter is 6-6  Justin Lord, but the Vaqueros are quick.  </P> <P> Moorpark (23-10) at Golden West (23-10) -- Golden West's 23 victories are the  most the program has had since Coach Jim Greenfield took over in 1978. Golden  West's best season was 1970-71 when the Rustlers were 26-6 under Coach Dick  Stricklin.  </P> <P> Golden West is down to eight players because of injuries, and starting forward  Kevin Andersen was ill Wednesday but still played as Golden West, the  12th-seeded team, ousted fifth-seeded Los Angles Valley, 84-80. Andersen is  expected to be back at full strength tonight.  </P></p>

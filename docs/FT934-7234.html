			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Money Markets: German M3, CPI eyed Portugal joined the European rate-cutting party yesterday and lowered two key money market intervention rates by  1/8 point, writes Conner Middelmann. The Bank of Portugal offered to inject seven-day funds at a fixed rate of 11.25 per cent in a securities repurchase tender, down from 11.375 per cent at the start of the previous period on November 12. In addition, it offered to drain funds with seven-day certificates at 10.25 per cent, down from 10.375 per cent. The past week has seen money-market easing in the Netherlands, Belgium, Norway and Austria following Tuesday's nine basis-point cut in the Deutsche Bundesbank's rate for two-week securities repurchase agreements. The Bundesbank also set a fixed-rate 14-day repo at 6.25 per cent for this week, reinforcing market hopes for continued - albeit slow - easing. Despite Tuesday's cut in the Nederlandsche Bank's special advances rate, the Dutch guilder's continued strength against the D-Mark and easier Dutch money-market rates spurred talk of another easing. However, the central bank left the rate unchanged at 6 per cent at its operation yesterday. In Germany, all eyes are on next week's release of October M3 money supply and November inflation data. M3 is expected to come in around the top of the Bundesbank's 4.5 to 6.5 per cent target range while inflation is expected to have slowed to around 3.7 per cent year-on-year from 3.9 per cent in October. Subdued M3 and inflation data could fan rate-cut speculation, despite comments from Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer who warned on Friday that 'we now have to stay on the cautious side'. He said the Bundesbank's recent rate cuts had already taken account of developments it expected to happen in the future. In the UK money market, the short sterling futures contract eased 0.01 point in thin trade to 94.61. The Bank of England forecast an early shortage of Pounds 1bn. In its market operations it purchased some Pounds 328m of bills and provided late assistance of around Pounds 510m. A small liquidity squeeze pushed the overnight interbank rate to around 6 1/4 per cent, but according to one trader, this should not be seen as an attempt by the Bank of England to quash rate-cut rumors.</p>

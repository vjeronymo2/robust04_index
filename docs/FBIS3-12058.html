Minister  Cardoso today received the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy  Party] leaders. Speaking in the name of his party, PSDB  President Tasso Jereissati invited Cardoso to become a  presidential candidate. Jereissati said his party considers  Cardoso's candidacy indispensable.    In his speech to the PSDB leaders, Minister Cardoso said he  accepted the nomination and would carry the banner of victory  because, according to him, it is the best way in which the  economic plan can be complied with.    Cardoso said that the country is tired of corruption,  inflation, and poverty. He told his PSDB colleagues that he  will officially inform President Itamar Franco of his decision  to step down from his ministry to become candidate for president  of the Republic during the cabinet meeting that is taking place  right now at Planalto Palace.</p>

			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / International Capital Markets: Top US banks consider cheque processing venture THREE of the biggest commercial banks in the US are discussing the possibility of setting up a joint cheque processing venture. The move would be aimed at reducing back-office and other administrative and operational costs at Chemical Banking, Bank of America and NationsBank. There could also be broader cost savings since these banks are also large processors of cheques for other banks. Although none of the banks wished to comment on the talks, first disclosed in the American Banker, a trade publication, executives with knowledge of the three-way talks said yesterday that technology for a unified cheque-processing network might come from International Business Machines. Bankers said the computer company has also been involved in some of the exploratory talks. The idea is to create a joint cheque clearing utility, which might include more than just the three banks already in talks. Analysts have calculated that such an entity could reduce processing costs by up to 50 per cent at some banks.</p>

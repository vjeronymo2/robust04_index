			<p>BFN     [Text] A government delegation headed by Deputy Prime  Minister Valeriy Shmarov returned to Kiev yesterday from the  United States. A news conference devoted to the results of the  visit was held at Boryspil airport. Our correspondent Yuriy  Horban has the details.    [Horban] Aside from Valeriy Shmarov, the delegation  comprised high-level officials from the Ministries of Foreign  Affairs, Machine-Building, and Defense Industry and Conversion,  as well as of the National Space Agency of Ukraine. As the  deputy prime minister noted, the wide range of issues discussed  in the United States primarily included Ukraine's joining the  international convention controlling the proliferation of  missile technologies and equipment, and its implementation of  provisions stemming from START I. Also discussed were  possibilities for cooperation in the power industry,  particularly, in nuclear power engineering and the conversion of  defense enterprises. Summarizing the negotiations held in the  United States, Valeriy Shmarov said the following:    [Begin Shmarov recording] There is a certain degree of  success in our cooperation with the United States -- its  recognition of Ukraine as a partner. The U.S. Administration  noted in a joint statement that Ukraine has become a reliable  partner. There is no attitude of, as the saying goes, an elder  or stronger brother -- regular work based on parity is being  carried out instead. Regarding our cooperation in RKRT  [expansion unknown], we signed a memorandum. For the U.S. side,  it was signed by Vice President Gore, from ours, I was  commissioned to sign it. The memorandum virtually opens for  Ukraine the possibility to conduct studies, as well as to launch  production and operation in the space-missile industry. This is  very important. I believe that it is a very important document  that makes it possible for our state to use and develop its  potential. A second aspect important for the future is that,  having analyzed the implementation of commitments stemming from  the tripartite declaration [on nuclear disarmament] and the  START treaty, the U.S. and Ukrainian Governments issued a joint  statement, in which Ukraine's actions and consistency in nuclear  disarmament were praised. The fact that the United States  announced in the joint, bilateral statement that all missiles  pointed at Ukraine will be retargeted by 30 May, I regard as our  important achievement; not only political but also a practical  achievement.    Regarding conversion, pilot projects were assigned, and one  of the projects -- concerning cooperation between the  Westinghouse and Kharprom corporations -- has already been  signed, meaning that the first step toward real cooperation has  been taken. In general, I would say that we have begun real  work in all directions of our cooperation, meaning that we are  moving from political intentions toward practical cooperation.  [end recording]</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Network Africa" program] </F>   [Text] Nigeria's Chief Moshood Abiola says he is under  arrest this morning. It appears that he was arrested late last  night after making a surprise appearance in front of a crowd in  Lagos yesterday afternoon. That was the first time that he had  been seen in public since he proclaimed himself president on the  first anniversary of the annulled 12 June election, which he was  widely believed to have won. Well, after his proclamation the  military government offered an award for his arrest and the  chief went into hiding. As he was being arrested, Chief Abiola  spoke on his mobile phone to James Sacks who asked where he was:    [Begin recording] [Abiola] I am speaking from my car. I am  being taken to detention.    [Sacks] So, where are you being taken to?    [Abiola] I understand to Anegbor Close, the detention  center.    [Sacks] And have you been told what exactly you are being  charged with?    [Abiola] They said I have been charged with felony or  allegation of felony, namely treason.    [Sacks] Having spoken to the rally in Lagos last night, is  this what you were expecting to happen?    [Abiola] In Nigeria, even the most unexpected can happen.  There is no [word indistinct]. [laughs] These things are not as  bad as they sound.    [Sacks] So, now that you are on your way to the police  station what are your feelings? Are you in any way changing  your mind about your position?    [Abiola] Absolutely not! Absolutely not! I have the  overwhelming mandate of the Nigerian people to be the president  and commander in chief. Even Sani Abacha confessed that two  days ago on television. He said injustice was done by the  annulment, yet he did not want to correct the injustice.  Instead, [laughs] his way of correcting this injustice is  charging me with treason, whereas it is he himself who is  leading an illegal authority over Nigeria by force of arms.    [Sacks] Now, you are on your way to prison at the moment. Do  you think that you are going to be less trouble or more trouble  to the military administration behind bars?    [Abiola] No it is not, you see.... [pauses] I am not any  trouble or anything. It is the people.... [pauses] This new  government is against the people, and they cannot win. They are  taking me in as the symbol of the people's mandate. The people  are not going to watch and let an individual override the  sovereign wish of the Nigerian people. He is about to find out  how truly important he really is. Just wait and see. I don't  want to say anymore. Thank you very much. [end recording]</p>

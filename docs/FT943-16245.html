			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / Inflation falls in Turkey Turkey's reform programme was given a boost yesterday on the eve of signing a standby agreement with the International Monetary Fund, with inflation falling to 0.9 per cent in June compared with 10 per cent in May. June inflation, the lowest monthly figure in two years, will underpin government efforts to restrain wages in the talks with public sector unions which start this month. Turkey's letter of intent with the Fund envisages an annual rate, which is now running at 115 per cent, will fall to 20 per cent by mid-1995. John Murray Brown, Ankara</p>

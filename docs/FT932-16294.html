			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / Money Markets: French rates unchanged ONE-MONTH interest rates in the French cash market were a little firmer yesterday lunchtime after the Bank of France decided to leave its intervention rate unchanged, writes James Blitz. One week into the lifetime of the new French government, there were strong expectations that the authorities in Paris would ease monetary policy to stimulate the French economy. However, the Bank of France left its intervention rate unaltered at 9.10 per cent. As a result, one-month cash firmed slightly from about 10.30 per cent at the start of the day to about 10.35 per cent. It later fell back to a level that was more-or-less unchanged on the day as the French franc rose to a close of FFr3.391 against the D-Mark in London. Some analysts were baffled as to why the French authorities were leaving official policy on hold, because the domestic pressures on the new French government to ease policy are getting greater all the time. Mr Jonathan Hoffman, director of Economics at Credit Suisse First Boston, said there was a striking dichotomy between the confidence of the new French administration and the uncertainty of the financial sector, which was crying out for lower interest rates. Mr Hoffman added that the recent end-of-year results of the major French banks underlined how painful it had become for them to borrow wholesale cash at high interest rates without passing these costs on to the retail sector. Last week, for example, Credit Lyonnais announced a net loss of FFr1.85bn for 1992. A problem for the French authorities is that they cannot be sure about the speed with which short-term German rates are coming down. The market appears to expect that the Bundesbank will ease the rate at which it offers wholesale funds to German commercial banks this week, but they cannot be sure. In the sterling cash market, short-dated rates firmed as dealers found it difficult to remove a Pounds 1.75bn shortage forecast by the Bank of England. Three-month money finished at 5 15/16 per cent last night, having been at 5 7/8 per cent on Friday evening. Overnight money traded at 8.75 per cent before lunchtime, when Pounds 1.2bn of the shortage had still not been removed. There was late assistance of Pounds 275m.</p>

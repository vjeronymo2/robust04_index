			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Power deal may aid coal rescue A DEAL struck recently between the regional electricity companies and the main power generators in England and Wales may have eased the government's predicament as it struggles towards a coal rescue package. The deal over thermal efficiency rates written into long-term contracts tentatively agreed last month should result in better margins for National Power and PowerGen than would have applied if assumptions in the existing contracts had remained unchanged. This may in turn encourage the generators to view with less hostility the government's insistence that they finance the stockpiling of an extra 15m tonnes of domestic coal. Leaked correspondence dating from February 4 and 5 between Mr John Baker, chief executive of National Power, and Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, indicated that there was a virtual impasse. The deal on efficiency is understood to have been reached five days later on February 9 or 10. 'No doubt the government is seeing this as useful,' said an individual familiar with the negotiations. 'The concession the recs (regional electricity companies) made was against the backcloth that the generators were being pressed to take additional coal tonnages,' said another. The agreement is favourable to the generators because they would be deemed to have consumed less raw material per unit of electricity produced. Efficiency improvements achieved over the past three years by closing inefficient plant means that assumptions written into the present contracts have fallen increasingly out of line with true efficiency levels and have contributed to the generators' excess coal stocks. Under the new agreements, due to come into force in April, the regional companies would take about 5 per cent more electricity than under the old arrangements.</p>

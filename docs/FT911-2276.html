			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / FT Law Report: Swiss bank instructions are set aside BANK OF CRETE SA v KOSKOTAS AND OTHERS Court of Appeal (Lord Justice Parker, Lord Justice Staughton and Sir David Croom-Johnson): March 14 1991 THE COURT has power to order a defendant to instruct his Swiss bank to disclose account documents for the purpose of a contested application for continuance of a Mareva injunction; but the order will be set aside if its purpose disappears in that the defendant abandons his opposition to the injunction, and if an application to stay or set aside the main action is pending which, if successful, would make disclosure unnecessary. The Court of Appeal so held when allowing an appeal by Mr Georgis Louvaris and Brockton Investments Ltd, the ninth and 10th defendants in an action against Mr George Koskotas, Mr Panayottis Vakalis and others, from Mr Justice Mummery's decision ordering Mr Louvaris to instruct his Swiss bank to disclose account documents for the purposes of a Mareva application by the plaintiff, the Bank of Crete SA. LORD JUSTICE STAUGHTON said that Mr Louvaris lived in Greece. Brockton was said to be controlled by him. The facts alleged in the action were that Mr Koskotas held an important position in the Bank of Crete, and had misappropriated Dollars 200m from its assets with the assistance of Mr Vakalis, who also held a position with the bank. Some of that money was said to have come into the hands of Mr Louvaris and Brockton. Two particular sums were identified, of DM250,000 and DM650,000. Out of those monies Brockton was said to have bought a flat in Finchley Road in St John's Wood. The Bank of Crete claimed to be able to trace the monies and to have a charge on them, and similar remedies in respect of the flat. On May 2 1990 Mr Justice Mummery ordered Mr Louvaris to sign a letter instructing his Swiss bank, United Overseas Bank, to disclose his account documents for the period January 1 1987 to October 31 1988. By the order, if Mr Louvaris defaulted in signing he would be debarred from defending the action. Counsel were given an opportunity to agree the letter. It said: 'I hereby instruct you to proceed and make single copies at my cost of each of the foregoing documents.' It released the bank from any liability under Swiss law and asked that the documents be sent to a firm of Swiss lawyers acting for the Bank of Crete. When the judge made that order there were other motions shortly to be heard in the Chancery Division. One was a motion to continue a Mareva injunction which had been granted ex parte over the English assets of Mr Louvaris and Brockton. There were also motions by Mr Louvaris and Brockton to set aside the proceedings for want of jurisdiction, or to stay proceedings on the ground that England was not the appropriate forum. The reason Mr Justice Mummery made the somewhat unusual order was that there had already been a contest as to whether the existing Mareva injunction should be continued. Mr Louvaris and Brockton were saying they had been guilty of no misappropriation and that there was no cause of action. At an earlier stage Mr Justice Morritt had said there ought to be a measure of discovery to enable the Bank of Crete to check the assertions in the affidavits made on behalf of Mr Louvaris and Brockton. That was an unusual measure. Normally a judge made up his mind on the affidavit evidence at that stage. After the original order for discovery a consent order was made, on February 7 1990, for production of documents relating to Mr Louvaris's D-Mark account with the Swiss bank, and also relating to an item in his account described as 'vente devises'. At first the documents were not produced. Then documents relating to the general account were produced with account numbers obliterated. There was a protest and further copies were produced, again with account numbers obliterated. Eventually proper copies were produced. Documents relating to the 'vente devises' were not produced and the solicitors for Mr Louvaris and Brockton, no doubt on instructions, said they did not exist. Eventually a document relating to that transaction was produced. So there was quite some history when the matter came before Mr Justice Mummery. Mr Louvaris now appealed against his order. Mr Hollington for Mr Louvaris pointed out that on June 18 1990, while the present appeal was pending, his instructing solicitors wrote to the Bank of Crete's solicitors, saying they abandoned their opposition to the Mareva. Eventually it was said that the abandonment applied to both Mr Louvaris and Brockton. Accordingly, Mr Hollington submitted, since Mr Justice Mummery's order had been made for the purpose of the Mareva application, it was no longer necessary. Mr Thomas for the Bank of Crete said the purpose of the order was not solely to enable the bank to sustain its application for continuation of the Mareva. When one looked at the affidavit of the Bank of Crete's solicitor, it was plain that the immediate purpose of the application to Mr Justice Mummery was to enable the bank to sustain its application for a Mareva injunction. At first sight it seemed there was no longer any need for Mr Justice Mummery's order. It might be that at a later stage the ordered documents might be relevant and discoverable in the action. But the application by Mr Louvaris and Brockton to set aside or stay the proceedings was due to be heard shortly after the May 2 proceedings. When the appeal was lodged against the May 2 order, it was decided to adjourn the application until the appeal had been disposed of. In the result, an application to set aside or stay the proceedings was still pending. Mr Hollington submitted that the application had some chance of success. He observed that Mr Louvaris lived in Greece. Little affecting him took place in the UK, except perhaps for the purchase of the Finchley Road flat. The application to set aside or stay the proceedings was not frivolous. If it succeeded there would never be a substantive order for discovery of the documents in the action against Mr Louvaris and Brockton. They were entitled to have that application determined before there was a substantive order for discovery. If it failed there could then, if necessary, be a renewed application for discovery. So, although the documents might prove relevant at a later stage, that was not sufficient ground for upholding the judge's order now that opposition to the Mareva injunction had been abandoned. Mr Hollington's second point was that there was no power to order that a party should send a letter to his bank and that if he defaulted he would be debarred from defending. The court was referred to Order 24 rule 16 of the Rules of the Supreme Court. Under Order 24 rule 16 the same effect could have been achieved by ordering Mr Louvaris and Brockton to disclose the documents and, if they were in their power, to obtain them from whoever had custody of them. If they failed to comply, they could have been debarred from defending. It was said the judge should not have made the order because there was only a trivial interface between the dollar account of which disclosure was sought and the D-Mark account which was relevant to the proceedings. That was a matter for the judge's discretion in the light of the action's history of discovery. He was entitled to take the view that the dollar account ought to be disclosed. It might be that the judge's order short-circuited the matter somewhat, but it was not on that ground, in view of the history of the case, an order he had no power to make. It was said for Mr Louvaris that a Swiss bank would not comply with a request in the form of the letter scheduled to the judge's order. Evidence was produced from a Swiss lawyer to that effect. The Bank of Crete produced evidence from another Swiss lawyer to the contrary effect. The issue was not determined. The Swiss were sensitive about their banking secrecy laws and also about intrusion into their affairs by court order from other countries. But even if the Swiss bank would not or might not comply with the request in the letter, that by itself would not be a ground for the judge not to make the order. The order should not be interfered with on those other grounds. However, in the events that had now happened it should be set aside. The appeal was allowed. Their Lordships agreed. For the Bank of Crete: Neville Thomas QC and Ian Geering (Denton Hall Burgin &amp; Warrens). For Mr Louvaris: Robin Hollington (Zaiwalla &amp; Co).</p>

Velasquez conceded  that the Venezuelan Government's insolvency is due to a "huge  foreign debt," as well as to an "even greater social debt, which  cannot wait."    According to Velasquez, the social debt is pending with 48  percent of Venezuelans living in extreme poverty and whose  incomes fail to cover the price of essential goods. Aside from  this, the current situation is that the government's social debt  also affects the middle class, which has been hard-hit  constantly since "the government for the poor" made everyone  poor. This is the way we have felt since that tragic Black  Friday.    Since that time, and in a sustained manner, the "middle  class," which does not receive any food stamps or other state  subsidies, is becoming ever smaller. The middle class only has a  salary, from which growing amounts are being deducted for taxes,  social security, and the housing fund without receiving any  benefits in exchange.    The Venezuelan "middle class" is one that does not illegally  hook its homes into the electric power grid but, rather, pays  its entire bill, including monthly "adjustments," and  accordingly, the bills for other services -- if they work --  such as water, gas, telephone, and garbage collection, which  also have extra charges.    The middle class comprises those Venezuelans who can no  longer afford a car, not only because a car is now as costly as  a luxury home used to be, but also because they cannot pay for  insurance to protect themselves from a very high theft risk. It  includes those who had to stop dreaming about owning a decent  home of their own because they had to give up their hopes for  credit because of rising interest rates. The middle class also  includes those who this year will have to forget about providing  a better future for their children because they have no access  to private schools or private medical attention, needless to say  a well-balanced diet.    The middle class also comprises those who today, in addition  to witnessing a decline in their purchasing power, must face  losing their savings if they had an account with Banco Latino or  are afraid of losing them if the crisis spreads to other  institutions.    The middle class comprises professionals, technicians, and  office clerks who, regardless of having a professional  background, see their hopes disintegrating.    Venezuelan society was always an open society where, with  work and effort, the poor had the hope of becoming a member of  the middle class. Leaving the shack was an achievable goal.  Currently, the poor feel as though they will never leave the  shack, while the middle class feels increasingly pushed toward  the shack.    The middle class builds the country. In Venezuela, these  builders are being destroyed. It is important that the national  leadership and, especially the new government, understand that  that social debt is much greater, and that it cannot be paid  with petty grants or food stamps. The solution to this problem  lies in an open and valiant fight against inflation, which is  impossible without a deficit reduction.</p>

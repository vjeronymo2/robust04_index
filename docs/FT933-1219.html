			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of Venture and Development Capital (8): A potent mix of skills - Venturer of the year, Michael Peagram HOLLIDAY Chemical Holdings is one of those companies that venture capitalists frequently dream about, but only rarely hold in their portfolios. Very rarely. The returns to institutional investors which backed Holliday's original buy out in February 1987 have been mouth watering by any standards. Led by NatWest Ventures - and supported by Citicorp Venture Capital, 3i, Thompson Clive and Apax - they subscribed Pounds 3m of capital to what was then at best a small and convalescing specialty chemicals group. When Holliday came to the stock market earlier this year their money had been turned into a stake worth Pounds 58.7m, equivalent to an annual compound rate of return of 73.6 per cent. The shares, floated at 195p, were last week trading at around the 220p mark. More than most companies of its size - its market capitalisation is now around Pounds 185m - today's Holliday is the creation of one man, Michael Peagram. His achievements have also earned him the distinction of being the fourth overall winner of the Venturer of the Year award, sponsored by the Financial Times, Cartier the jewellers, and the British Venture Capital Association. Michael Peagram's story is all the more remarkable in that it lacks any visible high technology wizardry or mould-breaking innovative spark. Holliday's enviable record of sales and earnings per share growth, indeed, has been based on a range of relatively unexciting products sold into niches of mostly mature UK and international markets. These products include dye stuffs and dyestuff intermediates for textiles, plastics and ink, hair dyes, photographic chemicals and sulphur dyes, sulphur dioxide and iodine derivatives, and fine chemicals for pharmaceutical and veterinary products. It is not as if Holliday's strategy - as developed before and after the buy out - even sounds exciting on paper. Any number of companies have tried to concentrate on higher margins, aimed to be more market led, attempted to source more cheaply, and vowed to expand on to the continent into related product areas. Far fewer actually deliver on the promise. Mr Peagram recalls thinking to himself a week after he arrived as managing director in October 1985 that he had probably lost his own money. Holliday Dyes and Chemicals, as it was then called - a family company with a proud history dating back to the 1830s - had been in receivership once and was in deep trouble again. Wooed away from the relative safety of Croda Chemicals - where he had also been managing director - Mr Peagram subscribed Pounds 50,000 for a 25 per cent stake (and an option on a further 24 per cent). Those early months, he says, were touch and go - 'it was a year before I really felt safe. Even so, if the recession had struck in 1986 we would probably have gone. There wouldn't have been time to build up enough fat.' Losses of Pounds 1m on sales of Pounds 8m in 1985 demonstrated just how dire things were, and Peagram needed all his natural persuasiveness and negotiating skill to convince Holliday's local Inland Revenue inspector at that stage not to pull the plug. After the initial turnaround the opportunity arose to buy out the majority shareholder - a Jersey businessman - which is when Peagram approached NatWest Ventures. Significantly the deal included ratchet terms which had the effect of boosting his personal equity stake - and reducing the holdings of the venture capitalists - if certain profit targets were hit - 'they never thought I'd make them,' grins the man whose personal stake in the business is now worth Pounds 37m. Holliday's success since the buy-out has stemmed from a combination of organic growth and a series of well conceived acquisitions, of which the 1991 takeover of Lancashire based William Blythe was by far the biggest. All in all, Holliday has spent Pounds 44.9m on acquisitions since September 1987. 'I've always had the philosophy that before we acquired a company we should do a very thorough investigation,' says Peagram. 'We generally try to identify 10 things that we can do when we take over. Trying three would make a difference, but we tend to go for all ten and end up succeeding with seven. In a nutshell, that's why the returns are so good.' Common features of Holliday companies include an industrial customer base, flexible plants, batch-based processes and high capital barriers to entry. But it has been that uncommon ability to breathe new life and ideas into underperforming businesses which has distinguished Peagram and his team from the run of ordinary companies. AS the Venture Award judges observed: 'Michael Peagram has a highly analytical approach to both the market and to acquisitions. He is a genuine entrepreneur and a fine manager, combining clear thinking, vision and strategic skills with excellent man management.' Mr Peagram admits his own style may not be everyone's cup of tea - but the enthusiasm and commitment are infectious and have undoubtedly helped him recruit and retain talented managers in the operating businesses. He acknowledges, though rejects, the fears of some City analysts that Holliday is a one man band, and has made it known that the roles of chairman and chief executive will be split within the next couple of years - 'this is not because of some theoretical corporate governance charter,' he explains. 'It's because there's plenty of work for two people.' Relations with the City have been good so far - a small dip in first half profits has not damped expectations of around Pounds 15m for the full year (against Pounds 12.4m in 1992) - and he comes across as strongly motivated by the challenge ahead. 'We've given the venture capitalists what they wanted. The big pressure now is from the new shareholders, with whom I have to establish a new track record over the next two to three years,' he says. Peagram is nonetheless conscious that managing a medium sized company may require new skills - given its historic record Holliday's turnover could be double 1992's Pounds 97m in a couple of years time. 'In many ways we are not a small company any more. Our factory here in Huddersfield, which has around 270 people, has much the same professionalism as the bigger ICI plant next door. 'But I don't see why larger companies can't apply many of the features of a well-run small business.' 1993 VENTURER OF THE YEAR AWARD: CATEGORY WINNERS Small start-up: Tillery Valley Foods/Chris and Hilary Bradshaw.

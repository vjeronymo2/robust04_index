			<p>BFN     [Text] According to Minister of National Defense Piotr  Kolodziejczyk, military cooperation between Poland, Germany, and  other Baltic states is very good.

The Polish defense minister announced that it was agreed to  include Finland in cooperation, which has joined Partnership for  Peace, and also Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. He said that the  first step would be a military exercise of sapper units, planned  for October in Jutland and to be attended, among others, by the  Lithuanians.

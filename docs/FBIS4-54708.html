			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Statement by the Democratic Party of Albania" -- ATA </F> headline]    [Text] Tirana, May 3 (ATA) -- Recently Albanian Orthodoxs,  wherever they live in Albania, celebrated freely and in a  festive way the great Easter and the resurrection day of Jesus  Christ, a press release of the Democratic Party [DP] points out.  The Albanian democratic state and all the Albanians respected  the religious feelings of the Albanian Orthodox believers. The  Albanian Television devoted an expanded part of its programs to  the religious ceremonies of the Orthodox Easter.    But, we regret that the Greek manipulations and provocations  were not absent even during this marked religious holiday. The  Democratic Party of Albania denounces as groundless and  niggardly the interventions of the Greek Government in affairs  of the Albanian Autocephalous Orthodox Church. These acts speak  of another example of the continual Greek interventions in the  internal affairs of Albania. The Albanian Autocephalous  Orthodox Church is independent in its activity and mission and  being so it has served and serves the Albanian Orthodox  believers and national interests of Albania. We avail of the  opportunity, the DP press release emphasizes, to remind his  holiness, Janullatos, that tens and hundreds of Albanian  clergies and patriots have been tried and sacrificed their lives  for the Albanian Autocephalous Orthodox Church. The Democratic  Party of Albania considers as holy the independence of the  Albanian Autocephalous Orthodox Church and condemns any  intervention and intrusion.</p>

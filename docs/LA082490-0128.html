			<p><P> August 24, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EVENING WEAR WOES;  </P> <P> BENEFACTORS SOUND OFF AT WAYNE CANCER CLINIC BENEFIT LUNCHEON  </P> <P> A charity fashion show featuring chic cocktail dresses and gowns seemed the  perfect place to find out what cogent comments women have about the current  state of evening wear.  </P> <P> "It's hard to find clothes within a certain price category," one woman said  emphatically. "You can find them for $300 and $3,000, but that in-between price  is hard to find."  </P> <P> "I'm looking for something that when I walk into a room every one of us doesn't  have on the same outfit," said another.  </P> <P> The women were surveyed during the John Wayne Cancer Clinic (at UCLA)  Auxiliary's annual membership luncheon/fashion show/fund-raiser Wednesday.  </P> <P> This group of supporters (99% were women) gathered in the ballroom of the  Regent Beverly Wilshire in Beverly Hills to view the 1990 Neiman Marcus gown  collection in a runway show titled "A Little Night Magic," produced by David  Cardoza. Body-hugging evening wear by Vicky Tiel, Bob Mackie's trademark glitzy  sequins and Isabelle Allard's slinky black lace gowns were paraded down the  runway by models in the highest heels and Bardot hair.  </P> <P> But some of the 550 women present spoke plainly about the lack of affordable,  elegant evening wear needed to maneuver through the upcoming hectic social  season in style.  </P> <P> "I'm offended when I go into Chanel and somebody tells me that the jacket's  $3,000 and the skirt's another $1,600. I'm not going to buy it," said Gretchen  Wayne, wife of Michael Wayne and a member of the auxiliary's board of  directors.  </P> <P> "I think you should be able to dress well and not look like everybody else. We  need to have better quality in the clothing too, at a price that's within  reason for the people who are shopping. I'm not shy about spending money at  all, but I don't want to wear something that looks like a uniform. Otherwise  I'll go back to wearing my high school uniform."  </P> <P> "Every year the John Wayne Cancer Clinic has a benefactor's event in December,  and I'll be needing a gown for that, and one for our auxiliary's major  fund-raiser in April," said Jackie Banchik, president of the auxiliary, who  wore a white pique suit with gold embroidery. "If I don't start looking now,  forget it. Because I'm small, it's hard for me to find things."  </P> <P> Lorraine Lubin and Elaine Lerman, co-chairs of the luncheon, were pinning their  hopes on New York designer Pamela Dennis, whose cocktail dresses and gowns were  featured in the show.  </P> <P> "We can wear her clothes," said Lubin. "They're great for women in their 50s."  </P> <P> "She has the freshest, most wonderful look of any new designer I've seen,"  added Lerman.  </P> <P> Dennis, 30, who came to the show, said she never designs a collection without  listening to her customers' needs.  </P> <P> "I do a lot of trunk shows," she said, "and I do listen to these women. I'm not  just in this to make things that sit on a rack. They tell me they want to look  classy but sexy at the same time. She really wants her husband to say, 'Wow!' I  mean, that's what I want."  </P> <P> But not all the talk at the luncheon was about clothes. Celebrity host Jill  Eikenberry (there with husband Michael Tucker) spoke of her battle with breast  cancer and stressed the need for support and care of anyone faced with the  disease.  </P> <P> So did honorary chairwoman Susan Dobson, who told of her mother's bout with  pancreatic cancer that doctors told her would take her life in three to six  months. She then introduced her healthy mother to the crowd to wild applause.  </P> <P> Other guests were Michele Lee and Joan Van Ark; Joyce Green, executive director  of the clinic; and more Wayne clan members, including Michael Wayne, Toni Wayne  LaCava and Melinda Wayne Munoz. Dr. Donald L. Morton, chief of the cancer  clinic, was presented with a check for $360,000, representing the money raised  last year from the auxiliary's events.  </P></p>

			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / Technology: A better use for design - Why are computers often so complicated to use? Hugh Aldersey-Williams looks at solutions Worldwide investment in digital communications and information systems is about to soar, but many companies have been slow to appreciate just how much this could change their operations. As well as affecting the electronics and telecommunications sectors, the shift in industrial emphasis will also influence the shape of all but the simplest products. In Britain, the design implications are well appreciated at London's Royal College of Art which trains students in computer-related design. The focus is on 'interaction design'. Products are becoming less bulky and more interactive. Design is less about objects themselves and more about use. 'In an increasingly software-driven economy, design becomes more important rather than less,' says Derrick de Kerckhove, director of the McLuhan Programme in Culture and Technology at the University of Toronto. 'It practically becomes the content of the product.' But interaction design has yet to make its name. Even manufacturers respected both for the styling of their products and for making them user-friendly are not yet making full use of designers in shaping their non-material aspect. 'Even at Apple Computer, there are few designers involved in interaction design. It is mostly computer engineers and a sprinkling of psychologists,' says Gillian Crampton-Smith, professor of computer-related design at the RCA. Computer specialists solve problems in ways that reflect their understanding of the workings of a machine rather than its eventual users. The result is often an electronically efficient device that is difficult or unpleasant to use. 'In the past, display graphics have been done by software engineers, for example,' says Stephen Hall, chief executive of IN. form, the UK design consultancy. 'Their problem is that they tend to live in a very closed world of computer technology that they understand very well.' Designers' relative ignorance of the technical side can be a benefit. The roll call of disciplines that could make future electronic products less alien will surprise many business people. According to Max Whitby of the Multimedia Corporation, an associate company of the BBC that publishes multimedia products, 'it's a synthesis of three disciplines: print design; television design for planning the delivery of information over time; and industrial design for the controls, etc'. These new design procedures offer some distinct business advantages. Where there is a temporal dimension, for example, it is possible to show that one design proposal is more effective than another simply by measuring the time a user takes to navigate a database to perform a desired task. It also becomes practical to test several trial designs. The IDEO design company of the US used this strategy in the design of an infusion pump - for McGaw, the American medical manufacturer - which delivers drugs intravenously under automatic control. By mocking up instrument controls on a touch-sensitive computer display and testing them with nurses, the designers found that doses should be programmed using a volume control rather than a numerical keypad. This eliminates the risk of large errors in dosage through pressing the wrong number or by misplacing a decimal point. This technique was not available, for example, in the early days of bank automated teller machines. People were leaving their plastic cards behind because the machines gave out the money before returning the card. That problem arose, says Hall, who designed the latest generation of ATMs for American Express, because the machines were made by a small clique of specialist manufacturers who did not consult enough people at the design stage. ATMs now return the card first. Many interactive products still do little to make users feel at ease - and not because the technology is fundamentally complex or hostile. Frequently, there has been no attempt to design 'a fluid, immersive experience', says Whitby. 'Too often the designer is brought in at the end just to fix the icons.' Because the requisite teams have mostly not been assembled within the commercial sector, the potential for interaction design is perhaps best seen at places such as the RCA where groups of students from different disciplines can be brought together to collaborate on specific projects. On behalf of American Express, IN. form set up a research study to extend the ATM: what other services could it provide? And how could those services be made more user-friendly? The RCA students' projects envisaged a multi-dimensional data space which could show present and past performance of stocks for personal investors. The FT-SE 100, the London stock market index, is shown on one wall of the space for comparison. The growth of investments of different amounts is modelled by columns of different diameter which grow over time from the floor of the space. The designer's concern is that the user approaches technology with preconceptions that must be shattered and fears that must be allayed. In the past, computer users have been willing to put up with bad design. Increasingly, however, people are becoming less indulgent.</p>

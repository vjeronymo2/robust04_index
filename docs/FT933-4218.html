			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Survey of World Car Industry (4): Tensions with the EC are growing - Painful negotiations are again under way between Brussels and Tokyo over the levels of Japanese exports / The Japanese in Europe THE rapid development of Japanese carmakers' production capacity in Europe is coinciding alarmingly with a steep downturn in west European new car sales. Inevitably tensions are growing between the European Community and Japan, as European carmakers face a growing burden of overcapacity and in many cases mounting losses. Painful negotiations are again under way between Brussels and Tokyo over Japanese export levels, as some European carmakers seek sharp cuts in Japanese vehicle shipments to the EC and call for restraints to be placed on the level of Japanese production in Europe. Under the terms of the controversial understanding reached by the European Commission and the Japanese Government in 1991 - the so-called 'Elements of Consensus' - there were to be 'no restrictions on Japanese investment or on the free circulation of its products in the Community'. At the same time, however, Tokyo undertook to avoid 'market disruption by exports from Japan', and to monitor the level of its exports for seven years to the end of 1999. The seven-year transitional period was to allow EC carmakers to adjust 'towards adequate levels of international competitiveness.' The vaguely-worded 1991 understanding, which itself was only reached after months of tortuous negotiations, had always threatened to be a minefield to administer from the moment it came into force at the start of this year. But Brussels and Tokyo could hardly have bargained with the enormity of the problem they now face in the first year of the monitoring system: a plunge in the west European car market steeper than that suffered in the wake of the first oil crisis in the first half of the 1970s. In April the two sides finally agreed on a ceiling for Japanese exports to the EC of 1.089m vehicles - cars and light commercial vehicles up to 5 tonnes gross vehicle weight - for 1993, a reduction of 9.4 per cent from 1992. The reduction was based, however, on an assumed reduction of only 6.54 per cent in the EC market this year. Even at the time the market forecast looked hopelessly optimistic, and in June the Commission was again forced to seek talks with Tokyo to try to negotiate a further reduction in Japanese exports. Another round of talks is expected to take place this month. In the event, new car sales in the EC have plunged by 17.8 per cent in the first six months of this year, with no sign of any recovery in demand in the second half. The downturn in the west European new car market could hardly have come at a more sensitive moment, with Japanese vehicle production in Europe starting to growing rapidly. Nissan, whose European presence is most advanced, has forecast a 51 per cent rise in output at its UK plant this year, to 270,000 cars from 179,000 in 1992. During the last 12 months Toyota and Honda have started production at their first European car plants, both located in the UK. Suzuki has started car assembly at its more modest facility in Hungary. Honda is expected to produce 32,000 cars this year at its Swindon plant in southern England, while output at Toyota's plant at Burnaston, near Derby, is expected to total 36,000 in 1993, rising to 100,000 next year. Magyar Suzuki, which is scheduled to produce 15,000 cars this year, is planning to raise output to 50,000 by 1995. In the UK Honda has talked publicly about raising output to 100,000 by 1995, while Toyota has named 1997 as the target date for reaching a capacity of 200,000 cars a year. However, vehicle industry analysts expect both plants to raise output significantly above these levels by the end of the decade. As output expands at these locations, Mitsubishi Motors is the next in line to start production in Europe. It is pushing ahead with the development of Netherlands Car (Nedcar), its joint venture with Volvo of Sweden in which a one-third stake is also held by the Dutch government. Mitsubishi and Volvo are investing heavily in NedCar - it is currently included in the Volvo 400 small family car series - for the development of a new range of cars to be launched in 1995/96. The capacity of the plant at Born in the Netherlands is being doubled to 200,000 a year. The output of 160-200,000 cars a year will be shared equally between Mitsubishi and Volvo. NedCar says that about Fl 3bn is being invested in the development of the cars and the plant, of which Fl 2.1bn will be financed by the present shareholders and the remainder financed externally. The training of several hundred NedCar employees at Mitsubishi's Mizushima plant in Japan is already beginning this autumn. Above all, the Japanese car plants are having a big impact in the UK, where they already account for more than a fifth of British car production. DRI, the UK-based automotive analysts, forecast that the car output of Nissan, Toyota, Honda and Mitsubishi in west Europe, will grow from 326,000 this year to 993,000 in 1998. At the same time the share of Japanese makes of car in the west European new car market is forecast to grow from 11.9 per cent last year to 15.5 per cent by 1998. The Japanese vehicle manufacturing presence in west Europe also includes several other ventures: Nissan Motor Iberica and Suzuki's Santana-Motor in Spain; IBC Vehicles, Isuzu's joint venture with General Motors in the UK, as well as Daihatsu's joint venture with Piaggio in Italy to produce small microvans; and the production under licence of Toyota pick-ups by Volkswagen in Germany. In Italy, Bertone produces a small volume of four-wheel-drive vehicles, called the Freeclimber, based on the Daihatsu Sportrak but powered by a BMW engine. The production of four-wheel-drive leisure/utility vehicles has proved an attractive niche for the Japanese carmakers in Europe, as these vehicles become increasingly popular as substitutes for cars. In the UK, IBC Vehicles produces the Opel/Vauxhall Frontera, a four-wheel-drive vehicle based on Isuzu technology. Frontera output is forecast at 42,000-45,000 this year. In Spain, Santana-Motor produces the small Suzuki Vitara four-wheel-drive vehicle with an output of 32,515 last year, while also in Spain, Nissan production includes the Terrano II leisure/utility vehicle - also sold as the Ford Maverick. Despite this rapidly growing presence, it has not all been plain sailing for the Japanese carmakers in Europe. In July Suzuki announced that it was being forced to abandon its planned venture to produce a small car in collaboration with Seat, the Spanish subsidiary of Volkswagen. The project was well advanced, with production already set to start in 1995, scheduled to rise to 150,000 a year. For Mazda, several years of negotiations - including talks with Ford and Saab - have ended in frustration; it has been unable to find a joint venture partner in Europe. Mazda is left as the only one of the leading Japanese carmakers with no firm strategy for European production. Nissan, too, has run into expensive problems in Spain, where Nissan Motor Iberica is accumulating heavy losses - they total Pta14.37bn (Dollars 116m) in the whole of 1992, and a further Pta11.1bn (Dollars 89.7m) in the first three months of this year alone. It has already been forced to inject Pta5.023bn (Dollars 40.5m) in new equity capital into the company so far this year, and expects to have to inject a further Pta10bn during the next 12 months. At the same time, there are signs that the Japanese carmakers will very quickly become just as vulnerable to recession in Europe as their long-established rivals. Already, Nissan has been forced this year to cut production in the UK of its Primera large family car, in response to falling sales across Europe. It has also had to stop overtime work at the plant.</p>

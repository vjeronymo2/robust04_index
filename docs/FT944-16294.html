			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / Airline disunited over flight attendants: United wants to keep them on but their own union wants them out Next time you take an international flight with United Airlines, the biggest US airline, spare a thought for the flight attendants. If they are anything other than American, they may be wondering how much longer they will have a job. This would hardly raise an eyebrow if it were simply another case of a cash-strapped US airline trimming operations to cut costs. In this case, however, United wants to keep the 1,354 flight attendants it employs at its three overseas bases; it is the attendants' own trade union that wants them out. Of the flight attendants involved, 777 are based in London, 338 in Paris, and 239 in Taipei. Like their US-based colleagues, these overseas attendants pay Dollars 39 (Pounds 24.60) a month in membership fees to the Association of Flight Attendants, the US labour union which all 16,873 United attendants are required to join. The union takes their money, but would rather not. It wants United's overseas bases closed because it says the people employed in them - mainly Britons and other Europeans in London, French in Paris and Taiwanese in Taipei - are depriving US nationals of employment on international routes, which is generally better paid than work on domestic flights. The row has gone on since the first overseas base opened in London in 1991, but it came to a head this summer when United succumbed to a union-led buy-out giving employees a 55 per cent stake in the company in return for Dollars 4.9bn worth of pay cuts and other concessions. The flight attendants' union said it would only join the employee buy-out if United agreed to close the overseas bases. United refused, for a number of reasons. Its overseas flight attendants, still relatively new to the airline, are cheaper to employ on international routes than their US counterparts because they are not as senior. The geographical spread of the overseas bases gives the airline more flexibility in planning work rosters and saves money in hotel bills. And the overseas attendants are said to get on better with United's international passengers than their US colleagues because they are more in tune with other languages and cultures. Since the buy-out, however, events have moved on. United is now owned by its employees, and Mr Stephen Wolf, the airline's uncompromising chairman and chief executive, has been replaced by the labour unions' nominee, Mr Gerald Greenwald. Keen to get the flight attendants into the buy-out scheme, the new management has been telling the union that it is prepared in principle to close the overseas bases after all. The stumbling block has been the seemingly trivial issue of language skills. United says that if the overseas attendants go, the resulting vacancies can only be filled by attendants with the appropriate language qualifications. The union says this is unacceptable because it will in effect bar the positions to most of its US members. Now, the issue has been complicated by another factor. Like other employee groups, the flight attendants have been asked by the management to take a pay cut - in their case, of 4 per cent - in return for participation in the buy-out. But in the absence of a deal, the attendants have just received a 4 per cent pay increase under their existing contract of employment. That means they would now have to take an 8 per cent pay cut to join the buy-out  -a highly uninviting prospect. To this extent, the threat of a deal with the management has receded. But the Association of Flight Attendants says the fact remains that the overseas bases are having a detrimental affect on the majority of US-based attendants, and are costing American jobs. 'Will this issue of job exportation go away? No, it won't,' Mr Kevin Lum, head of the union's master executive council at United, says. 'We are going to have to find a way to address it.' As for the overseas attendants, there is little doubt how they feel. The New York office of the Financial Times recently received an anonymous letter written on headed notepaper from the New York Helmsley Hotel, a regular layover hotel for United attendants, accusing the Association of Flight Attendants of 'treachery' against its fee-paying members. It said: 'To my knowledge, this would be the first time a labour union has actively campaigned for its dues-paying members to be effectively fired.' Ms Fiona MacDonald Hughes, a British flight attendant working from United's London base, says the letter probably sums up her colleagues' feelings. 'You have to look at it from the American point of view. It would be the same if British Airways opened a base in America and didn't send any Britons over,' she says. 'But people are bitter about the union taking our money and stabbing us in the back at the same time.'</p>

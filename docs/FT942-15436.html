			<p>940415 FT  15 APR 94 / Lords amend Sunday shops bill The Lords last night changed the Sunday trading bill to allow motor suppliers, garden centres and DIY shops to trade without restriction on Sundays, regardless of size. The move was approved in spite of fears expressed by Earl Ferrers, Home Office minister, that it could face problems in the Commons. Both houses have already decided that small shops should be able to trade without restriction on Sundays but that shops of more than 280 sq m should be limited to six hours.</p>

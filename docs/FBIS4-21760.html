			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Cairo, 31 Mar (MENA)--[passage omitted] In an  interview with today's AL-JUMHURIYAH, Interior Minister Hasan  al-Alfi noted that public opinion has exposed the terrorists for  what they really are--outlaws who have nothing to do with  religion and whose goal is to terrorize the people, spread  panic, and disrupt stability. [passage omitted]    The minister noted that cooperation exists among the Arab  interior ministers to confront the misleading ideologies as well  as the groups preaching such ideologies, because most of the  Arab states have started to realize the gravity of the ideas of  these gangs, which have become a threat to their regimes. These  groups use the same slogans, training methods, and even the same  instructors, he added. Proof of this is that bombs used in  Tunis, for instance, were made up of the same substances and  components as those used in Egypt, he added.    Al-Alfi expressed his belief that brainwashing of those who  join these organizations explains why particular individuals  carry out suicide operations. He noted that these organizations  receive continuing and considerable financial support. He said  that $15,000 and 20,000 pounds were seized from one of these  terrorist groups.</p>

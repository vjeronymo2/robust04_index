A XINHUA  reporter has conducted an interview with Hu Sheng, vice chairman  of the CPPCC National Committee and deputy head of the task  force for amending the CPPCC constitution.    [Reporter] The "Draft Amendments to the CPPCC Constitution"  have been submitted to the Second Plenary Session of the Eighth  CPPCC National Committee for examination. As deputy head of the  task force for amending the CPPCC Constitution, would you please  talk about the process of the revision.    [Hu] In May 1993, the Second Standing Committee Session of  the Eighth CPPCC National Committee adopted the "Decision on  Partial Revision of the CPPCC Constitution." A task force was  set up with Li Ruihuan as its head and Ye Xuanping, Wu Xueqing,  and me as the deputy heads. After half a year of work, the  "Draft Amendments to the CPPCC Constitution" have been completed  and submitted to the Second Plenary Session of the Eighth CPPCC  National Committee for examination.    [Reporter] Why is it necessary to revise the present  constitution?    [Hu] The present constitution was revised in 1982 under the  leadership of Deng Xiaoping, who was then chairman of the CPPCC  National Committee. It was a good constitution which played an  important role in ushering in a new situation in CPPCC work in  the new period. In the past 12 years, we have made tremendous  progress in reform, opening up, and the socialist modernization  drive, and the state has undergone profound changes.  Especially since Comrade Deng Xiaoping made those talks when  he visited the south and the convocation of the 14th CPC  National Congress, China has entered a new phase of reform,  opening up, and the modernization drive. To meet the  requirements of these changes, necessary revisions have been  made to the Constitution, the CPC Constitution, and the  constitutions of the democratic parties. Therefore requisite  revisions to the CPPCC Constitution should also be made.    [Reporter] What are the principles you followed in drafting  the amendments the CPPCC Constitution this time?    [Hu] In drafting the amendments, our principle is to take  the  guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress as our guidance, to  make the changes converge with the amendments to the state  constitution, and to emphasize the theory of building socialism  with Chinese characteristics, the basic line for the primary  stage of socialism, the system of multiparty cooperation and  political consultation under the leadership of the CPC, and the  socialist market economic system. We also took care to draw on  the new experience and new achievements in promoting socialist  democracy and CPPCC work since 1982. Provisions in the 1982  revised constitution that are still applicable today will, as a  rule, remain unchanged. We are not writing a new 1994 version of  the CPPCC Constitution. It is still the 1982 constitution with  some partial, necessary changes.    [Reporter] What are the main contents of the present  amendments?    [Hu] Contents about the theory of socialism with Chinese  characteristics, the basic line for the primary stage of  socialism, and the socialist market economic system have been  incorporated into some pertinent paragraphs and articles. While  asserting the CPPCC as a patriotic united front organization of  the Chinese people, the CPPCC Constitution, as amended, goes one  step further by asserting it as an important organization of  multiparty cooperation and political consultation under the  leadership of the CPC. It also expressly establishes that the  principal functions of the CPPCC include political consultation;  democratic supervision; organizing the parties, organizations,  and personages representing all nationalities and quarters to  participate in the deliberation and administration of state  affairs; and so forth.    It is possible that changes will be made to the draft when  it is examined by the Second Plenary Session of the Eighth CPPCC  National Committee. It will be promulgated after approval.</p>

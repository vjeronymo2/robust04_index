			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Chip Tsao in Hong Kong and Rain Ren in Beijing] </F>   [Text] A senior Chinese official in Hong Kong has told  EASTERN EXPRESS the real sticking point in the protracted  Sino-British talks was the issue of appointed seats on the  district boards after 1997. The official spoke as the Governor,  Chris Patten, was preparing to disclose the contents of the  secret Sino-British talks on political reform in Hong Kong later  today.    In Beijing, an official said the Chinese Government would be  publishing its own account of how the talks failed after  assessing the Hong Kong government's White Paper. The Beijing  official said: "We would like to see what Mr Patten wants to say  about the breakdown of the talks before we release our side of  the story."    It is understood the Chinese account will focus on its  concessions during the negotiations.    The Chinese official in Hong Kong said that technically  there  was "no 17th [final] round of talks" because Peter Lai, the  deputy secretary of constitutional affairs, rejected China's  compromise proposal during a preliminary discussion with the  Chinese team leader, Jiang Enzhu. The Chinese compromise  proposal was to give Hong Kong fully elected district boards  before 1997. After the transfer of sovereignty the new  government would add 100 appointed district board members to the  338 directly elected members.    He said that, as the talks drew to a close, there was  tentative agreement on three of the five key issues. They were:  The lowering of the voting age to 18; the affirmation that  district boards were to be given no executive powers; and the  right of members of the National People's Congress to take part  in Legislative Council elections.    The issues where there was no sign of an agreement were: The  abolition of appointed seats on the district boards; and whether  the single vote, single seat method should be applied to all  three echelons of election.    A Hong Kong government official said the British side could  not accept China's compromise proposals because the number of  seats for the district boards was a matter to be decided by the  future Special Adminstrative Region (SAR) government. He  believed the Chinese compromise proposal amounted to "an  undermining of the SAR's autonomy".    On his arrival in Beijing for the Preliminary Working  Committee meeting, a PWC member, Tsang Yok-shing, said he hoped  the Chinese side would release its document on the talks as soon  as possible.</p>

			<p><P> November 5, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS' MARCH IN PARIS TURNS INTO A RIOT  </P> <P> Youths wrecked stores and stoned riot police today as more than 100,000 high  school students nationwide joined marches demanding more teachers, better  facilities and improved security on campus.  </P> <P> Authorities said most of the marchers in more than a dozen cities were orderly.  </P> <P> But scores of youths threw stones and bottles at riot police deployed near the  National Assembly building in Paris, where lawmakers opened debate on the 1991  education budget.  </P> <P> At least five police officers and eight journalists were injured by  projectiles, police said.  </P> <P> Police responded to the bombardment by pushing back some of the youths with  clubs, but they generally avoided confrontations.  </P> <P> March organizers urged the protesters to remain peaceful and blamed the  violence on provocateurs.  </P> <P> Estimates of the number of protesters in Paris ranged from 20,000 to 40,000.  </P> <P> Youths damaged several stores, telephone booths and newsstands during a rampage  that lasted about an hour. Some students were seen trying to limit the damage  by passing potential projectiles to police officers deployed behind barricades.  </P> <P> Police Chief Pierre Verbrugghe said an unspecified number of youths were  arrested for looting a store along the march route.  </P> <P> Earlier, some youths had chanted slogans comparing the riot squads with Nazi  Germany's SS forces.  </P> <P> Other marches involving at least 3,000 students each were reported in Lyon,  Grenoble, Toulouse, Rennes, Brest, Clermont-Ferrand, Strasbourg, Lille, Lens,  Nancy, Marseille and Bordeaux. At least two cars were damaged in Lyon, where an  estimated 6,000 students marched.  </P></p>

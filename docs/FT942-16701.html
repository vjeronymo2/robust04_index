			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / International Company News: Swissair falls 48% to SFr59m Swissair, Switzerland's shareholder-owned national airline, announced that its net group profit fell 48 per cent in 1993, to SFr59m (Dollars 40.9m) from SFr113m in 1992, AP-DJ reports from Zurich. It also said it would pass its dividend on the 1993 results. As previously reported, the company posted a first-half 1993 group net loss of SFr65m. Swissair indicated a month ago that full-year 1993 group results would be positive. At the airline level, 1993 net profit fell 68 per cent to SFr6.7m from SFr20.8m in 1992. The company blamed fare erosion and said it would ask shareholders to agree to omit a dividend. Last year, the airline paid a dividend of SFr10 a share, down from SFr20 the year before. Group operating profit rose slightly last year to SFr216m from SFr214m in 1992.</p>

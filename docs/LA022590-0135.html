			<p><P> February 25, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> TRYING TIMES FOR ILLINOIS' LOU HENSON;  </P> <P> COLLEGE BASKETBALL: COACH MAINTAINS HIS COOL IN THE FACE OF AN NCAA  INVESTIGATION THAT PRODUCES CHARGES OF IMPROPRIETIES IN THE ILLINI PROGRAM.  </P> <P> He will write a book about these days and set everything straight. It will  answer his critics in a way that he cannot right now. And it will be titled  something like, "The Loneliest Days of Lou Henson."  </P> <P> But that is still sometime off in the future.  </P> <P> In the present, the coach of 19th-ranked Illinois sits calmly Thursday, but  tight-lipped, on the NCAA equivalent of Death Row, waiting for the evidence  that will send the real culprits to the electric chair in his place.  </P> <P> Last Thursday, the NCAA set out a bill of particulars of Illinois' alleged sins  and when Henson took his charges to a game in East Lansing, Mich., two days  later, the students there waved bills at them and yelled at him, "You're a  crook, Lou."  </P> <P> He has been an inviting target for a long time, hammered for things both  significant -- Indiana rival Bobby Knight rarely passes up an opportunity to  belittle his coaching skills -- and insignificant -- his wraparound hairdo, the  "Lou-do." And yet no one seems to have gotten deep enough under his skin to  touch that place where he really hurts and make him complain.  </P> <P> Not even in this past week, one of the roughest 57-year-old Lou Henson has ever  known.  </P> <P> "He was just born with that temperment," his wife, Mary, said. "In his quiet  moments, I'm sure he's thinking a lot about the situation and the criticism  that went with it. But he's got no problem pushing it aside and focusing on  whatever is necessary. He's been that way since I met him."  </P> <P> "I don't doubt he's heard the screaming," said Stephen Bardo, Illinois'  articulate senior guard, "We all have. You can't be human and not feel  something.  </P> <P> "But we really haven't seen any changes in him and we've been looking. He may  purposely be trying not to change any of the circumstances around the team to  keep us from focusing on this."  </P> <P> On Thursday morning, a cold winter rain has already filtered most of the light  peeking through a thin strip of windows on the back wall of his cramped office.  But Henson is in the midst of a never-ending good mood, smiling. He begins  drawing a map.  </P> <P> It is an accurate enough, but not very elaborate map. The state of Illinois is  a rectangle in the middle of the lined, yellow legal pad, the Champaign campus  a small circle at its center. Iowa is to the left, Indiana to the right.  </P> <P> "Why shouldn't we have an advantage recruiting here and here and here?" Henson  said, filling every corner of makeshift Illinois with dots from a black pen.  </P> <P> "And that's what makes me the most uncomfortable about this whole mess," Henson  said. "Because when bad things happen to us, everybody around us stands to  benefit."  </P> <P> Then he stops cold. What Lou Henson dares not say -- at least not now, anyway  -- is what everybody else in Champaign has been saying for days. That jealous  neighbors, the names most often mentioned belong to University of Iowa  recruiter Bruce Pearl and Notre Dame coach Digger Phelps, helped trump up the  charges and called in the cops.  </P> <P> A week ago Thursday, the NCAA leveled charges that Illinois committed six major  rules violations in recruiting two players over the last two years: LaPhonso  Ellis, a high school All-America who played at nearby East St. Louis and is now  a sophomore at Notre Dame; and Deon Thomas, another high school All-America  from Chicago's Public League and now a freshman at Illinois, though he has been  barred by the school from playing a single minute this season.  </P> <P> At the risk of oversimplification, both recruits allegedly were promised  eye-popping cash packages -- about $25,000 in Thomas' case and $80,000 for  Ellis -- a car and financial assistance to help relocate a relative.  </P> <P> None of the charges implicate Henson, though almost each names Jimmy Collins,  his assistant coach and chief recruiter. As a college player, Collins brought  Henson and New Mexico State from obscurity to the Final Four in 1970; as a  recruiter these past seven seasons, he has brought the finest talent from  basketball-rich Illinois and Chicago's especially wealthy Public League to  sleepy Champaign.  </P> <P> In the process, Collins frequently bumped heads with Pearl and almost always  won. That seems to be why Pearl phoned Thomas late one evening in May, and  unbeknownst to Thomas (and legal in Iowa) taped a telephone conversation  between the two. In it, Thomas apparently rambles on carelessly about what  Illinois has put on the table, and not long after that, the NCAA gets a listen.  </P> <P> That tape's effectiveness as a weapon, Illinois' defenders say, will soon be  rendered harmless. Thomas, they note, already has characterized his half of the  conversation as meaningless bragging, an immature attempt to get Pearl off his  back. And equally important, detractors belive they can prove the tape has been  doctored, noting a telephone bill shows the conversation to be 14 minutes long  and only six of those minutes are captured on tape.  </P> <P> The motives in Ellis' case, though, are decidedly less apparent. For one thing,  Ellis said nothing about any offers of payola for a year. For another, like  Thomas, Ellis' high school coach and almost everyone close to him -- friends  and relatives alike -- have denied any knowledge of the matter.  </P> <P> Which is how the suspicion began that somebody put Ellis up to this and how the  finger-pointing settled on Phelps, who thus far has studiously avoided stepping  into the fray.  </P> <P> But sources close to the investigation, who declined to be identified, offer  the following reasons: Phelps is upset because Illinois beat Notre Dame to the  punch on a TV contract with Chicago superstation WGN; Phelps is upset by his  inability to recruit in Chicago and is feeling the heat from alumni similarly  upset; Phelps, simply, has never liked Henson, and couldn't pass up an  opportunity to stoke a fire that Pearl had already set.  </P> <P> Henson won't field any of the possibilities, but it's clear this dull Thursday  morning that none of them has ruined his day.  </P> <P> Wednesday night, Illinois upset No. 9 Purdue, virtually guaranteeing its eighth  straight NCAA berth, its ninth in Henson's 15 years, and he has an abiding  faith that tomorrow will be even better.  </P> <P> Even though he knows come April, or June, or whenever it is the NCAA gets  around to deciding this case, he could become a sacrificial lamb, his firing an  offering part of the cleansing ritual schools undergo to appease the NCAA.  </P> <P> "A head coach should take the blame," Henson said, eyes still bright. "It's  like a family. You have kids at home and they may do something completely  outside your reach.  </P> <P> "But it's still," he said, "your responsibility. And that still means something  to me."  </P></p>

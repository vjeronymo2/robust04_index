			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Everest Foods suffers pressure on margins Everest Foods, the West Midlands-based potato chip producer, blamed low-cost economy products for a 47 per cent decline in pre-tax profits in the year to May 31. The group, which also owns Ashfords, the lossmaking food distributor, saw pre-tax profits fall from Pounds 2.09m to Pounds 1.1m, despite a 14 per cent rise in turnover from Pounds 31.9m to Pounds 36.3m. Mr Bob Gilbert, chairman, said that supermarket demand for economy goods put severe pressure on margins. The group has revised its contracts to lend more flexibility to potato pur-chases. However, the group argues that its contracts place it in a strong position to survive the current potato crop fears, which have pushed prices high. Everest cut its final dividend to 1.3p (2.5p), leaving a total of 2.5p (3.7p). Earnings per share declined from 5.46p to 3.23p. Ashfords, which made losses of about Pounds 250,000 this year, suffered as Sunday trading by supermarkets reduced demand from the smaller convenience stores which the distributor supplies. In July, Everest sold the majority of its stake in Arnold Davies, the egg production company, to concentrate on its core business of potato products.</p>

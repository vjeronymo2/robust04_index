			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (What It Means For You): Reforms to tax-paying pushed to the forefront - Self-assessment Self-assessment, the biggest shake-up in the UK tax system since PAYE was introduced half a century ago, crept ever closer yesterday with the Budget announcement of a raft of anti-avoidance measures. The chancellor found time in his speech to tell the House of the 'positive response' so far to the reforms put forward by the Inland Revenue and he promised to try to keep the burdens on employers to a minimum. The reforms were set in train in 1993 and the progress towards implementation is now accelerating. Eight million taxpayers will have to take part when self-assessment comes on stream in the 1996-97 tax year. For the newly self-employed, compliance began on April 5 this year. 'SA', as it is known, catches more than taxpayers. If you are an employer the system will require you to provide employees with more information than in the past. Details on what employers would have to provide were published yesterday. While the Revenue points out that the new system will ultimately be cheaper, faster, simpler, and more accurate, taxpayers face changes on a big scale. SA is a new tax system, with a new set of tax forms, and a new set of payment dates. Of those who currently return a tax form, and who will be caught by the new legislation, half are self-employed and half employees. They include business partners, directors, and employees and pensioners with complicated tax affairs. SA has several basic building blocks but is essentially founded on the assessment of tax with respect to figures provided by the taxpayer. The taxpayer is invited to carry out this assessment themselves on the forms provided - but this is not compulsory. Everything else is. The new system is one based on current year assessment. Your tax bill for any year relates to your income in that same year. The new system brings together all income, and capital gains, to be taxed at one time. The present system has different payment dates, for different years, and different types of income. The new system has a set of payment dates which are fixed. Three payments are made in a year. Two are due on January 31 in one single transaction: they are the first payment on account for the current year and a payment, or refund claim, to settle up on the previous year. The second payment on account will be due on July 31. For example a taxpayer with income tax liability of Pounds 5,200 for 1997-98, the first year of current year assessment, would pay Pounds 2,600 on January 31 1999 and Pounds 2,600 on July 31 1999. If the actual tax liability for 1998-99 is found to be Pounds 5,600 then on January 31 2000 the taxpayer would pay Pounds 400, the balance for the previous year, and Pounds 2,800. On July 31 the taxpayer would pay the second instalment of Pounds 2,800. And so on. The new tax form itself will have to be in by January 31 after the end of the tax year it covers in those cases where the taxpayer has 'self-assessed': in other words calculated their own tax. If the taxpayer has opted for 'revenue calculation' the return, with all the relevant information, must be in by the previous September 30. The system is based on 'process now, check later' in that, apart from obvious errors, the taxpayer's figures are accepted. However all returns will be checked and a sample reviewed and taxpayers interviewed. Such inquiries will usually have to begin within 12 months of the due date for the return. There is also a system of penalties. Yesterday the chancellor announced measures to stop tax avoidance which could come about by the moving of profits or income into the transitional period between accounts compiled on the preceding year basis and those on current year basis. Because of the overlap between the periods, an averaging out of profits is proposed and some profits will drop out of the reckoning entirely in order to make sure there is no double taxation. The scope for manipulation is wide and the Treasury signalled its intention to act in March this year. The measures announced yesterday are now open for consultation. While agents, such as accountants and other tax practitioners, are already preparing themselves for the transition period and beyond, many individual taxpayers may be in for a surprise. The new tax form not only looks different but it asks different questions. At present self-employed taxpayers who file returns can write 'as per accounts' on their returns and post them off with the accounts attached. The new form will require the figures to be placed in a pre-set format. PAYE taxpayers who also file a tax return can, at present, cut corners by referring to employer-provided documents in answer to questions, for example, on benefits in kind. Employees will now need this information from their employers - and they will need it in time to avoid penalty.</p>

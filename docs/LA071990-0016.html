			<p><P> July 19, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EARNINGS  </P> <P> AMR Corp.: The nation's largest airline company said its second-quarter  earnings fell 27.4% to $129.2 million from a year ago.  </P> <P> Earnings fell despite a 9.5% increase in revenue to $2.97 billion. The  Dallas-Ft. Worth Airport-based parent of American Airlines attributed its  earnings decline to weaker-than-expected traffic and higher operating expenses.  The firm said revenue increases did not keep up with the rising costs of fuel,  maintenance and airport operating fees.  </P></p>

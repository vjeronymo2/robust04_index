			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / Finance &amp; the Family: More help for small shareholders - Diary of a Private Investor AROUND 1.66m people applied for shares in BT3. But how many of them also will buy shares in non-privatisation issues? Probably considerably less than two-thirds. Although it has been estimated that British adults owning shares have increased from 9 per cent in 1979 to about 25 per cent, more than 70 per cent of them have an interest in only one or two companies. According to figures from Proshare - of which more in a moment - private shareholders in 1957 held 65.8 per cent of UK quoted shares directly, while pension funds and insurance companies accounted for 12.2 per cent. By 1989, and despite a spate of privatisations, the number of UK quoted shares owned directly by private investors had slumped to 21.3 per cent, while pension funds and insurance companies owned 48.8 per cent. What explains this dramatic change? I believe it can be attributed largely to two things: the considerable tax advantages given to pension and life assurance companies compared with private investors owning shares directly; and the belief by many people that, apart from privatisation issues, owning shares is rather risky and best left to 'experts.' Another reason why many private investors view direct investment with some caution is because they have read about corporate scandals, such as executives awarding themselves huge salaries for modest successes and being given excessive payments to leave companies which they have brought almost to their knees. What influence can an ordinary private shareholder have over the general governance of a company? City institutions have a number of powerful committees which make representations to the government and can use the threat of their massive voting power to work behind the scenes to encourage changes in various badly-managed companies. But where are the equivalent committees to represent private shareholders? Many people also are unsure about how to buy shares. It is easy with privatisation issues: just clip a coupon in a newspaper. But acquiring shares in other companies can seem a daunting experience. Where can they turn for impartial help and guidance? Fortunately, there are now two organisations which seek to improve the lot of the private investor: Proshare, and the UK Shareholders Association (UKSA). Proshare was formed last year and encompasses the old Wider Share Ownership Council and the Stock Exchange Investors' Club. It offers a number of attractive benefits in return for the Pounds 30 annual subscription. I have been a member since the start and, besides an informative and well-written monthly bulletin, I have received a number of other useful publications. Especially helpful was Proshare's Guide to Information Sources for the Private Investor. This ranked newspapers, magazines, newsletters, radio and television programmes, and a variety of other information sources according to their value for money, ease of use, simple language and up-to-date information. It also gave brief summaries of the content and nature of each information source, along with details of cost and how and where it could be obtained. Proshare organises events for members, too. These have included visits to such companies as Granada, Eurotunnel, Pilkington and British Airways, plus visits to the stock exchange and seminars on a variety of investment topics, including options. Proshare members also get details of a variety of special offers on products likely to be of interest to private investors. Financial support for Proshare has been provided by the stock exchange, the Department of Trade and Industry, a number of major companies and the Gatsby charitable trust. But while it aims to 'stimulate fiscal initiatives that will give the private investor equal taxation treatment with the institutional investor' and will engage in 'promotional initiatives to encourage more user-friendly and lower cost share distribution services,' Proshare does not offer openly to aid shareholders in their relations with particular companies. This task is done ably by the recently-formed UKSA. The association is independent and gets all its income from subscriptions: Pounds 20 a year for full members and Pounds 12.50 for associates. Its main aim is to 'stand up for private shareholders' as well as to 'provide a forum for private shareholders to voice their concerns' and 'promote improved standards of corporate governance.' Already, UKSA has submitted a number of recommendations to various industry and government committees. There are thriving shareholder organisations in Germany, Holland, Sweden and the US, and UKSA aims to learn from them. I have joined recently and can look forward to three newsletters a year, although the association hopes eventually to produce between six and 12. UKSA also organises special events, which have included meeting John McFarlane, chairman of the task force established recently by the Auditing Practices Board to look into 'the future development of auditing.' I very much welcome the advent of these organisations. Perhaps it will not be too long before the government heeds their advice and reverses the seemingly inexorable decline of direct investment in shares by private investors. Further details of UKSA can be obtained from its chairman, Donald Butcher, 12 Burgh Heath Road, Epsom, Surrey KT17 4LJ. Details of Proshare are obtainable from its offices at Library Chambers, 13-14 Basinghall Street, London EC2V 5BQ.</p>

			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / Battle for Australian pay-TV worthy of the medium: A struggle between the media heavyweights and the underdogs for satellite broadcasting licences The convoluted power games surrounding the introduction of pay-TV in Australia would do credit to any television soap opera. On one side are the nation's media heavyweights, including Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Limited and Mr Kerry Packer's dominant Nine Network, as well as Telecom, the giant state-owned telecommunications group. They are joined by Network Ten and Seven Network, two other commercial TV stations, in a consortium known as PMT. On the other are a couple of fledgling companies and joint ventures which - to everyone's surprise - have ended up as holders of two satellite broadcasting licences. The big guns want to overturn those licence awards and headed into court last month, on the grounds that the authorities did not comply with the bid guidelines, to try to do so. But government ministers appear to have stepped in - perhaps aware that the pay-TV saga does nothing for Australia's image and reportedly concerned that one state agency (Telecom) was suing another (Australian Broadcasting Authority, which awarded the licences). On Friday, via a five-minute court hearing, the consortium's action was withdrawn. For one of the licence holders, the recently floated Australis group, this is a huge relief. Had a legal wrangle developed, its imminent fund-raising plans, expected to involve about ADollars 200m (Pounds 98.5m), could have been jeopardised. But while the underdogs may have won the latest battle, the real question is whether they have won the war. Analysts, looking at the opposition's clout, are doubtful. 'Murdoch and Packer are not likely to let Australis steal their market,' says Mike Magnan, at Pru-Bache Securities. In theory, Australia's 18m inhabitants should be a ready market for subscription services. Disposable income is high and TV-watching is an ingrained habit. About 60 per cent of households have two televisions, according to a survey by the Australian Broadcasting Authority. About 83 per cent own a video recorder. But, for various reasons, pay-TV never got a look-in during the 1980s. This spared the nation's existing commercial networks any threat to their revenues. Only in 1991 did the Labor government lift a moratorium on subscription services. Even then, it took another two years, and furious political jockeying, before a system for allocating satellite licences was devised. A two-channel licence was reserved for the state-owned Australian Broadcasting Corporation (the C licence). Two other four-channel licences (A and B) were put up for auction last April. The A licence was subject to stringent cross-media ownership rules and designed to attract new entrants. The B licence, by contrast, was expected to go to the newly formed alliance between Messrs Murdoch and Packer and Telecom. But PMT was outbid, and the A and B licences ended up in the hands of two largely unknown companies, UCOM and New World Telecommunications. Behind both was a Lebanese-born computer distributer, Mr Albert Hadid. At the end of 1993, Mr Hadid sold the B licence on to Australis Media, acting in conjunction with Lenfest, a US-based cable company. The A licence, meanwhile, went to a joint venture between Continental Venture Capital, an Australian investment company, and Century Communications, another second-league US cable operator. With a legal challenge to Australis in effect now ruled out, observers are wondering what cards PMT, or its members individually, will play next. There are some areas that will be closely watched. First, Australis has yet to tie up any programming. Second, its plan envisages that satellite services will be delivered into most homes via microwave delivery system (MDS) which cuts out the need for a satellite dish. This latter element could prove a problem in the short term, given that Mr Bob Collins, the former communications minister, decided last year that MDS delivery of pay-TV should be banned until after the satellite system was up and running. Australis says that there is nothing to stop the ABA doing preparatory work on MDS delivery approvals, and then giving the green light simultaneously with the satellite launch. But even if these issues are put to one side, it seems that the PMT pressures on Australis are likely to increase. Most immediate, for example, is the danger that other technologies for delivering pay-TV will steal a march or at least woo the most accessible consumers and create enough confusion to make satellite marketing difficult. Only days after the PMT lawsuit was filed, a company called Cable Television Services announced a deal with Telecom which, it claimed, 'would launch Australia's first pay-TV service in July 1994'. CTS is headed by Mr Lynton Taylor, a former senior executive at Mr Packer's Nine Network. He was chairman of the PMT consortium until November. CTS's plan is to deliver a 10-channel service via a cable network provided by Telecom. Much of this is in place, with fibre-optic cables extending to the local exchanges, although Telecom would have to cable the final stretches into the home. CTS says it has finalised programming agreements with Turner Broadcasting in the US, giving it non-exclusive rights to CNN, the Turner Cartoon Channel, and TNT, the movie channel. However, it will be months or years before most Australians see any benefit. Pressed for details, Telecom says the plan is to hook up about five high-density Sydney suburbs by the July launch date, bringing the CTS service to perhaps 6,000 homes at the outset. Even on the CTS forecasts, this cable network will reach only 1.1m homes, a fifth of the nation's households, in three years' time. Telecom says that it is in discussions with various other would-be cable operators. 'There's a high probability that some additional agreements will be reached, although only two others are of the size of CTS,' says Mr Ross Kelso, manager of the regulatory and technology aspects of Telecom's pay-TV strategy. The telecoms group is also talking about running trials of an alternative ADSL (asymetric digital subscriber line) cable system in 1995 on a commercial basis. This would send video images down existing copper wires into the home. If successful, this might be a cheaper and easier way of delivering subscription services to outlying areas. For some observers, then, the final outcome of Australia's pay-TV battle is plain: PMT, or its members, will end up making life so difficult for Australis, that either the company, or its B licence, will eventually end up in the consortium's hands. Mr Magnan, for example, agrees that this is a likely outcome - 'but not at these prices', he warns. For consumers, meanwhile, the upshot is an array of possibilities, many promises but no service yet. Two decades after pay-TV became available in the US, Australia - home to some of the world's best-known media moguls - is still waiting.</p>

			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / International Company News: German toolmaker deal closer SHARES in Maho and Friedrich Deckel, two of Germany's largest machine-tool manufacturers, were suspended yesterday as they finalised their planned merger. The shares have been suspended pending a formal valuation of the two companies to determine the terms on which the merger - and an accompanying capital-raising issue - is to be effected. The transaction is set to be finalised in September. The fusion of the two south German companies, for decades bitter rivals, underlines the severity of the downturn in the German machine-tools sector. Both are loss-making and analysts believe a merger is the only way they can survive amid market conditions depressed by weak demand for capital goods. From being one of Germany's most prosperous industrial sectors, machine-tool production fell 13 per cent in 1991 and a further 17 per cent last year. It is set to fall again this year, taking output to half the level of 1989, the record year for the industry in Germany. The merged company will have market share of between 35 and 40 per cent of the domestic German market for certain types of products, for example milling and boring machines. The transaction is still subject to the approval of Germany's cartel authorities. Maho, based in Pfronten in south Germany, lost DM157m (Dollars 98.1m) in the year to the end of June, 1992 on sales down 31 per cent to DM442m; Deckel, based in Munich, lost DM75m last year on sales down from DM406m to DM290m. The merger is likely to be effected by the exchange of one Deckel share for 1.2 Maho shares. It was first announced in April after Maho abandoned plans for a strategic alliance with Traub, another machine-tools company. Traub announced a co-operation deal with Berthold Hermle, manufacturer of milling and boring tools.</p>

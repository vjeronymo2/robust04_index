			<p><P> November 18, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> VILLA PARK SURVIVES SHAKY START, THEN PUTS AWAY ESPERANZA  </P> <P> So much for flashy starts.  </P> <P> On the first play of the Division III playoff game Friday night between  Esperanza and Villa Park High Schools, Esperanza's Jarod Smith caught a 68-yard  bomb from quarterback Keith McDonald over the top of the Villa Park defense for  a touchdown.  </P> <P> From there, though, the game belonged to Villa Park. After Esperanza forged a  14-6 lead on a 15-pass from McDonald to Jeff Corbett, Villa Park ran off six  consecutive touchdowns and pulled away to a convincing 48-28 victory over  visiting Esperanza at Fred Kelly Stadium.  </P> <P> "If they're going to score, they might as well score in the first 10 seconds,"  Villa Park Coach Pat Mahoney said. "That gave us the whole game to make up the  difference."  </P> <P> Villa Park erased it with a vengeance. Leading the way was halfback Gary  Bladow, whose 196 yards in 17 carries included three touchdown runs, the most  important of which was a 40-yard sprint up the middle that tied the game at  14-14 in the second quarter.  </P> <P> Villa Park held a 20-14 lead at the half. But Villa Park sophomore Ellis  Williams took a kickoff 47 yards to open the second half, and three plays  later, quarterback Jason Martian scrambled 28 yards for a touchdown to make it  27-14.  </P> <P> Century League co-champion Villa Park (8-3) will face El Toro (10-1) in the  second round next Friday.  </P> <P> "Hopefully we'll be healthy by then," Mahoney said. "Hopefully the kids will  come back to school with no more than a bruise here and there."  </P> <P> Esperanza finished 6-5.  </P></p>

			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / 'Tell us your single market troubles' European citizens and businesses should report any complaints about the year-old single European market to the European Commission, officials said yesterday. They said they were satisfied with the progress of the single market project, in spite of certain teething troubles. The Commission estimates that the implementation of the market has added 0.4 per cent to annual economic growth in the European Union since the project was set in train in 1986. They pointed out that recent criticism from business and consumers was not reflected in complaints to the Commission, which is supposed to enforce the aims of free movement of people, capital, goods and services. Mr John Mogg, the senior Commission official responsible for the internal market, said yesterday Brussels would not be soft on infringements of the market's rules, but it could not act on unsubstantiated reports. 'We are not complacent, but we have to know what is going on. We have had a very low level of complaints, which we have dealt with either legally or with the appropriate directive, but if we don't hear about problems we don't know about problems,' he said. Mr Mogg admitted there were certain gaps in the market, particularly in the central objective of abolishing passport checks at internal borders, which has still not been achieved more than a year after the single market 'deadline' of January 1 1993. But he also hit back at reports of companies' dissatisfaction with the year-old system of collecting and monitoring value added tax. Mr Mogg cast doubt on the depth of one recent survey by KPMG, the UK accountants, which pointed to British exporters' dissatisfaction with the market.</p>

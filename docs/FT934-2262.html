			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / World Trade News: Air Canada buys Airbus widebodies worth Dollars 800m The European Airbus aircraft manufacturing consortium yesterday announced six firm orders from Air Canada for its new long-range A340-300 widebody airliner worth more than Dollars 800m (Pounds 537m). It also said it was setting up a new division in Beijing called Airbus Industrie China to reinforce the group's commercial, industrial and product support operations in the fast-growing Chinese aviation market. Airbus will create a training centre and spares facility in Beijing as part of its expansion into the Chinese market. The Air Canada order for A340 aircraft follows last week's order by Cathay Pacific, the Hong-Kong based airline, for a similar order for six A340-300 long-range air-liners. The two deals are a boost for Airbus which is competing fiercely against the US Boeing company's new 777 twin-engine widebody airliner with its A340 four-engine aircraft and its twin-engine sister, the A330. Airbus is also seeking to make growing inroads into the Chinese market against tough competition from the US manufacturers which have already developed a strong presence in China. The European consortium currently has three customers and airline operators in China including China Eastern in Shanghai, China Northwest Airlines in Xian and China Northern in Shenyang. It has won orders for 18 airliners from China this year.</p>

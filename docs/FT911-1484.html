			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Property: How low can you go? - Examples of some of the knockdown prices which were available offered at Pounds 3.5m late in 1987 and subject to fiercely competitive bidding - was eventually bought for a fraction under Pounds 5m, in spite of needing another Pounds 2m of upgrading work. Within months of the purchase the planned sale of the new owners' business fell through and the house had to be offered for resale privately. Many visitors and countless trips to the bank later, the house was finally sold earlier this year for just Pounds 2.5m - a 100 per cent discount before costs on what the vendor admits to have been, in retrospect, a reckless price. A London Docklands' penthouse - bought with an 80 per cent staff bank mortgage for Pounds 475,000 in June 1987. The keys were posted to the lenders mid-1990 by the Australian owner who left London six months after being laid off by the bank. He'd simply given up trying to keep pace with loan costs. The flat was re-sold for Pounds 285,000 earlier this year, a 40 per cent discount on the purchase price. The lender has accepted that the gap between the mortgage plus rolled-up interest charges and the resale price has to be written off. A substantial North London detached house - bought for Pounds 875,000 in June 1988. Re-offered for sale at 'over Pounds 900,000' in March 1990, the price was cut to Pounds 825,000 in June 1990 and cut again to Pounds 750,000 by new agents in September 1990. It was re-marketed on the basis of 'offers over Pounds 700,000' last October and was subject to a bid at Pounds 710,000 that month. Before the owners had time to put away the celebratory champagne, that offer fell through. The house was finally sold for Pounds 740,000 in February this year after the owners had initially received two identical offers of Pounds 725,000. The sale represents an 18 per cent discount on the purchase price after two and a half years of costs and a near divorce. A 1950s semi-detached former council house bought on a 40 per cent discount by the tenants for Pounds 42,000 in December 1988. Resold in a lot with six other houses and flats at auction by the mortgagees after a repossession sale for Pounds 35,000 in May 1990, and resold within days by the trader-purchaser for Pounds 68,000 - in line with its estimated market value two and a quarter years ago. Private resales in flat blocks where the owner has to compete with developer sales - no developer discounts or offers special mortgage rates, so the only sale incentive is price. The best of the Docklands flats in Wapping and the Isle of Dogs - now discounted to levels that offer double-figure returns in a lively rental market. The supply of waterfront flats is thin after two years with no new schemes and anyone able to take a three to four year view on values should see substantial capital growth. Fully modernised family homes in prime central London - never out of fashion and increasingly back in demand. West Country and Hereford houses - an area too far away for Londoners who cannot work some of the week at home, but who bought anyway in the late 1980s. The cheapest Costa del Sol flats - there is virtually no holiday resale market for these now and new developments aim to provide far larger and better quality accommodation but there is growing local demand for staff and low cost housing, and no supply. Repossession properties - with professional advice only from auctions. Beware the long unsold property re-branded as a 'no offers bargain'. That's often a way of attracting scavenger bidders without any change to the asking price. Also beware of priced properties, since every property for sale in the country has been termed 'realistic' in recent months whether it is cheap, fairly valued or outrageously over-priced. 'Guide prices' can be equally misleading as the term might best be described as a figure reflecting hope over experience; it's left to the buyer discover whether that's a vendor's hope over agency's experience, or not.</p>

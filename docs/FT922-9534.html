			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Survey of Switzerland (2): Decisions loom on Europe - Ian Rodger looks beneath the calm of the country's political life PERHAPS IT is the calm before the storm. In the past year, Swiss political life has been eerily quiet, especially in contrast to the previous turbulent three years of scandals and consequent debate about the effectiveness of the country's peculiar political institutions and traditions. Probably the biggest issue to disturb politicians in the past year has been dealing with the country's surprisingly large number of drug addicts. And while one would not attempt to underrate the seriousness of the drug problem, it is not a matter that is likely to influence the country's future. By contrast, everyone knows that vital decisions about Switzerland's place in Europe and the world are just around the corner, starting with next week's referendum on joining the International Monetary Fund and followed by another one in the autumn on whether or not to build new railway tunnels through the Alps. The tunnels are aimed at defusing the long-running dispute between Switzerland and the European Community over transit rights for EC lorries. That referendum is a prelude to another plebiscite, now expected in mid-1993, to approve a treaty uniting the six countries of the European Free Trade Association (Efta), including Switzerland, with the EC in the so-called European Economic Area (EEA). That, in turn, is seen by the government as merely a 'first step' towards Switzerland becoming a full EC member. Yet, so far, public debate on Europe has been muted, to say the least. In last October's general elections, for example, the issue was scarcely discussed. There was no clear theme in that campaign although, as in other European countries, extremist and single theme parties made gains at the expense of the four-party grand coalition that has been in power since 1959. The anti-immigrant Automobile Party, for example, raised its representation from two seats to eight in the 200-seat National Council, while the Swiss Democrats, another anti-immigration group, raised their tally from three to five. On the left, the Greens won 12 seats, three more than they won in the 1987 elections, while the Lega dei Ticinesi, a new populist formation from the Italian speaking canton of Ticino, took two seats. Among the coalition parties, only the Social Democrats and the conservative People's Party maintained their totals of 41 and 25 seats respectively. The conservative Radicals dropped from 51 to 44 and the Christian Democrats from 42 to 36. In all, the election result was seen as only a mild rebuke to the ruling parties for the scandals of the last parliament, notably that over Mrs Elisabeth Kopp, the former justice minister, who tipped off her husband that a company of which he was vice-chairman was under investigation for money laundering. She was acquitted in 1990 of breaching official secrecy, but the judgment was widely criticised. Another scandal raged over revelations that cabinet ministers were unaware that federal police maintained secret files on more than 900,000 Swiss citizens and foreigners living in the country. These scandals, together with other indications that the Swiss government system was no longer working effectively, led a number of critics to press more stridently for radical reforms. The fact that parliament sits for only four three-week sessions a year, for example, is considered an anachronism. It should become a full-time body, many argue, but the politicians themselves rejected the idea last year. Similarly, the size of the cabinet, with only seven members, one of whom takes a turn at being president under an annual rotation system, is considered hopelessly inadequate for today's needs. And many of its tasks, such as setting speed limits and appointing minor officials, could be delegated. The result is that the cabinet has trouble finding time to debate important issues, such as those thrown up by a group of experts in March on the compatibility of Swiss neutrality with membership in the European Community. Also, the cabinet's composition, according to the so-called magic formula that splits the ministerial portfolios among the ruling parties and representatives from regions and language groups, is considered by many to be far too rigid. However, critics admit that the cabinet is a fair representation of the bland combination of four parties making up the governing coalition. It is perhaps worth pointing out that the two conservative parties could, with the help of splinter parties, control parliament on their own. There have been suggestions from time to time that the grand coalition may collapse, but there is no sign of it at the moment. The Social Democrats threatened last month to take the government to court for making a SFr50m down payment on a Dollars 2.3bn order for 34 F-18 fighter aircraft, but they backed down when their coalition partners suggested this was an unfriendly move. Another complaint about the political system is that the conditions which a group of citizens has to fulfil so as to force a plebiscite have become too light. It is said that almost anyone with enough money to hire the right public relations agency can raise the required 100,000 signatures to force a vote on any issue. The figure has not changed in a century, except in 1977 when it was roughly doubled to take account of women being given the right to vote. But all these complaints have receded somewhat in the past few months, perhaps reflecting a feeling that, compared with some other countries in these tough times, Switzerland is not, after all, that badly governed. Also, the cabinet has at least twice shown an uncharacteristically high sense of purpose in recent months. Last October's decision to make membership in the EC official government policy and to declare that ratification of the EEA treaty was only a 'first step' towards accession to the EC itself startled many observers. Only two members of the cabinet, Mr Rene Felber, the foreign minister and this year's president, and Mr Jean-Pascal Delamuraz, the economics minister, are unconditionally enthusiastic about EC membership. Another, Mr Adolf Ogi, the transport and communication minister, is in favour, but cannot stray from his People's Party's negative stance. Mr Flavio Cotti, the interior minister, and Mr Arnold Koller, the justice minister, are unenthusiastic and Mr Otto Stich, the finance minister, is resolutely opposed. In March, Mr Felber, flanked by Mr Stich, Mr Delamuraz and Mr Markus Lusser, president of the Swiss National Bank, appeared before the press to make a passionate appeal to the people to endorse the government's plan to join the IMF and World Bank. 'It is in institutions like the IMF or World Bank which practise international co-operation on the basis of recognised rules that states see their rights best protected,' he said. It remains to be seen if this forceful presence is enough to win the day in next week's referendum. Many observers doubt it, but even if the government's policy is rejected, life will go on as normal. 'There is no opposition in parliament,' says Mr Christoph Blocher, the outspoken president of the People's Party in Canton Zurich. 'In our system, the people are the opposition.'</p>

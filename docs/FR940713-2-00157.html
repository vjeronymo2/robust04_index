Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act (Perkins Act). Under the absolute priority, funds under this competition would be reserved for applications proposing to demonstrate successful cooperation between the private sector and public agencies in vocational education programs that serve criminal offenders under the supervision of the justice system. In addition, the Secretary particularly invites applications that, within the absolute priority on correctional education, incorporate one or more of the following invitational priorities: (1) advanced technologies; (2) community-based correctional education; and (3) juvenile justice education. The Secretary also imposes requirements related to the priorities and other matters, and will use new selection criteria in evaluating applications submitted for this competition only.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  The provisions in this notice take effect either 45 days after publication in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  or later if Congress takes certain adjournments.

This program can help further the purposes of the National Education Goals; specifically, the correctional education priority directly supports the Goal that, by the year 2000, every adult American will be literate and will possess the knowledge and skills necessary to compete in a global economy and exercise the rights and responsibilities of citizenship.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The designation of correctional education as a priority under the Cooperative Demonstration program is based on the critical problems of illiteracy and recidivism pervading our Nation's adult and juvenile corrections population. The U.S. Department of Education's National Adult Literacy Survey Report, ``Literacy Behind Prison Walls'' described a 70 percent illiteracy rate among a sample of prisoners as follows:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> About seven in ten prisoners&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*&blank;are apt to experience difficulty in performing tasks that require them to integrate or synthesize information from complex or lengthy texts or to perform quantitative tasks that involve two or more sequential operations and that require the individual to set up the problem (1993, p. vi).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Additionally, a recent study, ``Vocational and Academic Indicators of Parole Success,'' published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Journal of Correctional Education <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , found that inmates who had received academic and vocational training while in prison were more likely to be employed and less likely to commit crimes after their release than other inmates (Schumacker, et al., 1990).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Academic and vocational training is also critical for probationers and parolees, since the majority of the Nation's criminal offenders are serving sentences within community corrections settings. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, there were about 3.5 million adults under correctional supervision in the United States at the beginning of 1993. Of these, 2.6 million, or 74 percent, were under active probation or parole supervision within the community.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Educational programs for criminal offenders that use applied learning strategies to teach life skills, job skills, and literacy can reduce the likelihood that the offenders will return to the criminal justice system. After completing their sentences, ex-offenders often have limited opportunities for meaningful employment and lack necessary basic life skills, including the job-seeking and job-retention skills needed to obtain and maintain employment. Without basic literacy and job skills, it is unlikely that these persons will become fully productive members of society.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On April 6, 1994, the Secretary published a notice of proposed priorities, required activities, selection criteria, and other requirements for the Cooperative Demonstration Program (Correctional Education) in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (59 FR 16192). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Note:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> This notice of final priorities does  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> not <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  solicit applications. A notice inviting applications under this competition is published in a separate notice in this issue of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Analysis of Comments and Changes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In response to the Secretary's invitation in the notice of proposed priority, 18 parties submitted comments. An analysis of the specific comments follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Absolute and Invitational Priorities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter recommended that priority be given to programs that build on correctional education projects previously funded under the Cooperative Demonstration Program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary intended that previously funded correctional education demonstration grants, awarded in September 1992, include plans for continuing after Federal funding ends, as demonstrated by the selection criteria used in the earlier competition. The Secretary believes that while expanding previously funded programs may indeed be worthwhile, other projects should be afforded the opportunity to compete for these limited Federal funds. Nevertheless, previously funded projects are eligible to apply for funds under this competition on the same basis as other projects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters made suggestions for more comprehensive services to be identified under the proposed priorities, including: pre-vocational assessment, individual training plans for students, case management as an approach to providing social services for released offenders, student retention as an outcome measure, use of support systems in the community, and the availability of non-traditional vocational training programs for female offenders. One commenter recommended that invitational priorities be created for offenders with special learning needs and histories of substance abuse. One commenter also recommended that the coordination of the academic, vocational, and substance abuse treatment components be an integral feature of the funded projects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG -->  <!-- PJG /FTAG --></p>

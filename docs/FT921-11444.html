			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Oftel to keep firm control on BT prices OFTEL, the regulator of the telecommunications industry, yesterday promised to maintain firm control over BT's prices as it launched its most comprehensive review of the company since privatisation. The review, which is unlikely to be completed before the middle of the year, will take place at a time of public debate over whether BT is earning excessive profits. The debate is expected to be particularly intense because of the general election campaign and Oftel's decision to conduct the review in public. BT yesterday announced a 4 per cent fall in third quarter pre-tax profits to Pounds 759m from a previous Pounds 787m, a result of regulatory and competitive pressures and the recession. Mr Iain Vallance, chairman, countered criticism about BT's profitability, saying it was reasonable. The Labour party, however, claimed profit levels were still excessive. Sir Bryan Carsberg, Oftel's director-general, said the new price control, which would take effect in August 1993, would 'provide BT with a tough challenge'. But he said the current control was starting to affect BT's profits. Sir Bryan argued that a price cap was preferable to direct control of BT's profits because this gave the company an incentive to cut costs and improve efficiency. Oftel published two consultative documents - one on BT's prices and the other on its cost of capital - and invited comments by March 27. After the consultation period, Sir Bryan will try to strike a deal with BT and if unsuccessful, he can refer the matter to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The main issues in the review are: Should the price cap be tightened or loosened? At present, BT is required to cut the average price of a basket of its main services by 6.25 per cent a year less than the annual rate of inflation. Should BT be allowed to increase line rental charges rapidly? At present, it is barred from raising them by more than 2 per cent above the annual inflation rate but argues it is losing money on the service. Oftel said its investigations suggested there was justification for increasing household rental charges to Pounds 100 a year from the current Pounds 73.84, but gave no timescale for such a move. In that case trunk call charges might be cut by 50 per cent and local call charges might go up by 30 per cent. Many telephone users, for whom rental charges are a large portion of their bills, would resist rapid increases. The Telecommunications Users' Association hoped the review would stop BT 'manipulating prices in those areas where it holds a monopoly' - BT does faces little competition in the residential market. Oftel promised to review BT's policy on disconnecting non-paying customers. 'A utility with a captive market can abuse its position by using the threat of disconnection to make sure that the company's interests always prevail over those of the customer,' it said.

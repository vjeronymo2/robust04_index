The goal is  for a prestigious third party to evaluate the results and  progress of joint research at that research laboratory where  researchers from Japan and overseas, and from industry, the  government, and academia have gathered and tackled problems. In  addition, the employment of Russian researchers as public  research employees will also be studied.    The evaluation committee will consist of people with  well-known achievements both as researchers and as research  managers. The members are currently being selected. Beginning  with Japanese scientists who have won the Nobel Prize, 14  candidates are being appointed. Two or three heads of research  institutes in the United States and Germany are expected to  participate.    The content and management system of ongoing research at the  same research laboratory will be discussed every one or two  years. The evaluations of the evaluation committee will be  received as outside opinions; however, the independence of the  laboratory will be respected concerning the progress of research.    AIST will reorganize its national laboratories at Tsukuba.  As  one link, the laboratory was set up in January to undertake  basic research that intersects fields like materials and  information.    To promote joint research with, for instance, foreign or  private corporations, in 1993, 14 foreign researchers have  already been employed as public researchers in 15 national  research laboratories throughout Japan. Currently, one  researcher from Russia has been accepted at the Hokkaido  Government Industrial Research Institute (GIRI). The employment  of a second person in fusion research is being studied.</p>

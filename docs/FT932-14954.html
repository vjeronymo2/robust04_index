			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / Russia and The G7: French commercial banks oppose rescheduling of Russian debt France's commercial banks plan to oppose attempts to reschedule Russia's Dollars 20bn private debt until the Russian financial system is more stable and corruption has been curbed, Alice Rawsthorn writes from Paris. French banks, which account for between Dollars 3.7bn and Dollars 4.6bn of Russia's private debt, will put their case this weekend to the London Club meeting of western banks. Gallic banks with heaviest exposure are Credit Lyonnais, Banque Nationale de Paris and Societe Generale. Mr Michel Freyche, president of the French banking association, said they would not agree to Russian proposals that commercial lenders should reschedule loans along the same lines as official creditors agreed earlier this month with their Dollars 38bn debt. He said they should wait until proper exchange controls were in place and corruption stamped out.</p>

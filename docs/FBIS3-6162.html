			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Commerce Minister Uthai Phimchaichon has told  reporters that it is unfair for France to set up barriers  against Thai fish products, noting that the Commerce Ministry  has been trying to settle the matter through diplomatic channels  and instructed the Thai commerce attache to closely monitor the  situation.    Uthai said: "If France continues to use such unfair measures  against us, we must plan to reciprocate as France exports mostly  luxury goods to Thailand. If we do nothing, France will treat  us like that again." The commerce minister disclosed that other  countries suffering from the French action include Indonesia and  the Philippines. France, by so doing, has claimed that these  countries have no specific quality control agencies for their  fish products. Meanwhile, the European Union has set the end of  1994 as the deadline for all its members including France to do  away with such protectionist measures.</p>

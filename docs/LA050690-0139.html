			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> WARRANTS TARGET $17.6 MILLION IN ACCOUNTS LINKED TO DRUGS  </P> <P> Federal drug agents served warrants to confiscate $17.6 million in South  Florida financial institutions as a nationwide drug money laundering crackdown  focuses on suspicious accounts, a spokesman said Saturday.  </P> <P> Federal officials froze $400 million in more than 750 accounts nationally three  weeks ago as part of the long-running Operation Polar Cap. Investigators have  been working to pin down the origin of the funds, said Drug Enforcement  Administration spokesman John Fernandes.  </P> <P> The seizure warrants served Friday in South Florida, covering $17.6 million,  were for accounts in which investigators have concluded that there was  "probable cause" to believe the money was drug proceeds, Fernandes said  Saturday. He said he did not have any details on what seizure orders might have  been issued in other parts of the country.  </P> <P> The warrants were served on bank officers for 72 accounts at 20 South Florida  banks -- a legal step in the process of transfering the suspected drug cartel  money to federal coffers. In all, accounts had been frozen in 78 Miami banks.  </P> <P> The government also could prosecute bankers and the account holders after  tracing the money, Fernandes said.  </P> <P> "If we show complicity on the part of a bank or bank official or some  representative of a corporation or a front corporation or what have you, that  would be a separate part of the civil action," the DEA spokesman said.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the account holders are preparing to fight the freezing or loss of  funds, with some arguing they were involved in "flight capital" -- sending of  assets from troubled foreign countries to the United States -- and not money  laundering.  </P> <P> "It's the only way people in Colombia can have dollars in the United States to  avoid inflation and other problems with the Colombian economy," said Fred  Schwartz, an attorney for a Colombian industrialist with $600,000 in frozen  accounts.  </P> <P> Schwartz and other attorneys say their clients bought dollars in Latin America  on the black market -- a huge pot of money swelled by the cocaine trade --  without knowing the cash was drug-tainted.  </P> <P> The money then was transferred to U.S. accounts, often in violation of currency  laws abroad, as a cushion against the vagaries of Latin American economics and  politics.  </P> <P> The Justice Department obtained a court order April 16 in Atlanta to freeze  accounts in 173 banks in 22 states after investigators estimated Colombia's  Medellin cartel amassed $1.2 billion from cocaine sales from 1987 to early  1989.  </P> <P> Federal officials believe $400 million was returned to the United States to  support drug trafficking.  </P></p>

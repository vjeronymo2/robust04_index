			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Shi Wensheng, director of the Heilongjiang </F> Provincial Coal Industrial Administrative Bureau and head of the  preparatory leading group of the provincial coal department, by  reporter Yin Liming (1438 4539 2494) on deepening reform,  transforming mechanisms, and being extricated from a difficult  position -- place and date not given]    [Text] Recently, the State Council abolished the Northeast  China and Inner Mongolia Coal Industrial Corporation,  established coal industrial administrative bureaus respectively  in various provinces, simultaneously merged provincial coal  departments with these bureaus, and defined the management  functions and duties of the ministry and the provinces according  to the principles of separating government functions from  enterprise management and of balancing the relationship between  the central authorities and the localities. On 14 May, this  reporter had an interview with Comrade Shi Wensheng, director of  the provincial coal industrial administrative bureau and head of  the preparatory leading group of the provincial coal department,  on the issues of how our province's coal enterprises can  overcome their difficulties and extricate themselves from the  difficult position.    Shi Wensheng introduced: The party Central Committee and the  State Council fully understand and have been extremely concerned  with the difficulties of state-owned coal enterprises cropping  up since the development of the market economy. In March and  April, Vice Premiers Zhu Rongji and Zou Jiahua sponsored  meetings on several occasions to especially study the coal  industry's problems cropping up in the operation of the economy.  In mid April when Vice Premier Zhu Rongji and the leading  comrades of the state departments and commissions concerned  conducted investigation and study activities and handled  official business on the spot in our province, they concentrated  more energy to study and resolve the difficulties of the  state-owned coal enterprises in Heilongjiang and also adopted a  series of supporting measures as follows: The value added tax  rate of the coal enterprises should be reduced from 17 percent  to 13 percent. Four million yuan of loans will be granted to  the Jixi, Hegang, Shuangyashan, and Qitaihe coal mining  administrative bureaus to ensure the payment of wages to their  staff members and workers as well as the supply of funds  urgently needed in production. The time limit for the return of  the loans that were granted to the Jixi and Hegang coal mining  administrative bureaus before the Spring Festival to ensure the  payment of the wages to their staff members and workers will be  extended from three months to nine months. Loans will be  granted to the power, metallurgical, and chemical industrial  trades to help pay off the arrears of the payments for goods to  the Jixi, Hegang, Shangyashan, and Qitaihe coal mining  administrative bureaus. These measures have been or are being  implemented in a step-by-step manner and will greatly help  promote the reform, development, and stability of the  state-owned coal enterprises in the province. It can be said  that this is a historical turn in the development of  Heilongjiang's coal industry. The situation ahead of the coal  industry of the province at present can be summarized as good  opportunities, many advantages, great difficulties, and heavy  tasks. The key to grasping favorable opportunities, using  advantages, overcoming and tiding over difficulties, and  welcoming challenges hinges on the enterprises themselves. The  coal enterprises should ultimately rely on the deepening of  self-reform, make painstaking efforts to enhance internal  strength, and strengthen management.    Shi Wensheng pointed out: Deepening reform and changing  mechanisms is the fundamental way for coal enterprises to  extricate themselves from the difficult position. The coal  industry of our province should comprehensively popularize  Kailuan's experience to carry out the simulated legal persons'  operation method and to set up the internal market mechanism.  It is necessary to reform the highly centralized management  pattern of mining administrative bureaus, determine small  accounting units, and carry out the internal economic contacts.  The auxiliary production units of all mining administrative  bureaus, such as machine repair plants, water works, power  plants, and transportation departments, should assume  responsibility for their own profits or losses, settle accounts  for themselves, externally offer services, and push themselves  to markets. At the time of offering internal services, the  units in service of the people's livelihood, such as  guesthouses, vehicle teams, and administrative services, should  positively create income from the outside places to make up for  the deficiency in internal services. The enterprises  subordinate to these coal mining administrative bureaus, such as  water and heat supply units, should create profits. Production  plants and sections are allowed to carry out either the  two-level legal persons management method or the simulated legal  persons management method; keep separate accounts; settle  different accounts among different levels; and gradually change  from the simple relations between higher levels and lower  levels, the relations between the first line of administrative  management and the second line of administrative management, and  the relations between to serve and to be served to the relations  with the focus on economic contacts.    Reducing the staff and increasing efficiency is a major  measure for the coal enterprises to halt deficits and increase  profits. This year, the four bureaus in our province plan to  reduce 50,000 staff members and 10,000 raw coal production  personnel. According to this target, all bureaus should reduce  the existing pit management personnel, reduce the quotas of the  office cadres at various levels, remove unplanned employees, and  strive to basically realize the goal of three-line separations  within 2 years. Simultaneously, it is necessary to accelerate  the setup of the modern enterprise system. The bureaus and  collieries where conditions permit should carry out the  corporate system on a trial basis, strive to gain experiences in  carrying out the system, and gradually popularize it. We should  pay attention to summing up the small-sized mines and plants'  experiences in implementing, on a trial basis, the state  ownership and civilian management system, the decontrolled  management system, the leasing management system, and the  shareholding system; gradually perfect and develop these systems  based on the existing conditions; and expand the implementation  of the systems. It is necessary to continue to achieve the  auxiliary reform; to deepen the reform of the labor, wage  distribution, and social insurance systems as well as the  organizational structure; and to reduce enterprises' burdens on  developing social undertakings.    All bureaus and mines should exert efforts to reasonably  readjust structures and upgrade overall economic quality of  enterprises. We should optimize the product mix, grasp the  washing and processing of raw coal, expand the raw coal washing  volume, and promote a big increase in coal products. According  to the demands of markets and consumers, we should readjust the  production volume of pits. Under the current situation that  supply exceeds demand, we should adopt resolute measures to  close down and suspend the operation of those pits with poor  production conditions, without guarantee for safety in  production, with poor coal quality, without good sales, with low  economic results, and whose deficits surpass their wage bills  and the extra-business expenses.    Although our province is rich in coal resources, the  resources are, after all, limited and will not be produced  forever. Some of our pits have become withered through the  development in the past decades. Thus, we are required to grasp  the current work, make long-term arrangements, appropriately  readjust product mixes, and accelerate the development of the  non-coal economy. Not only collieries but also plants should  develop a diversified economy and the tertiary industry. We  should extend the orientation of development from coal bases to  coal-power, coal-steel, and coal-chemical industrial bases and  take the paths of increasing value through processing and making  overall development. We should prominently lay stress on the  investment in the development of a diversified economy and the  tertiary industry; strive to build a group of key larger-scale  projects with strong competitiveness and good economic results;  develop the projects with "less investment, short construction  periods, and rapid efficiency" that are closely related to coal  production, the construction of coal industry, and the  livelihood of the staff and workers; ensure that a project that  has been completed can promote the development of a number of  other projects, and increase the input and output rates.    Objectively speaking, our coal enterprises are extensively  managed and still have to tap great potential for production,  washing and processing, sales, and supply. Thus, we must turn  our eyes inward, tap potential, and strengthen management to  seek high efficiency. We should set up a system of  responsibility for control of fixed-quota production costs,  perfect accounting and management systems, stop up loopholes,  strengthen the management of capital, reduce all expenses,  strengthen the management of the supply of goods and materials,  and strive to enliven capital.    In short, all bureaus, collieries, and units should make  concerted efforts, firmly grasp the main contradiction and the  central task of being extricated from the difficult position,  attach primary importance to implementing and expanding the  achievements in resolving the problems in coal industrial  development, and organize and mobilize the broad masses of party  members, cadres, and staff and workers to make self-improvement  and be independent and regard the rejuvenation of Heilongjiang's  coal industry as the primary task. Only by doing will our  province's coal enterprises be developed rapidly.</p>

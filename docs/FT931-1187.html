			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Advance by power stocks NEWS THAT PowerGen is to pay a second interim dividend of 7.15p a share, coupled with widespread relief that the Government's White Paper on the coal industry brought no regulatory negatives for the power generators, saw the two English and Welsh generators surge ahead. PowerGen shares raced up to equal their all-time high of 342p, a net gain of 16, following very heavy turnover of 7.3m shares. Dealers in the utilities sector said the market had expected PowerGen to bring forward payment of the dividend from June to March because of the alterations to Advanced Corporation Tax in the Budget. There was, however, marginal disappointment with the dividend level proposed. National Power, expected to follow PowerGen in bringing forward its final dividend, climbed 12 to 336p after turnover of 6m shares.</p>

			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / Rivalry among Bosnian Moslems sharper as troops storm radio station at Bihac THE BOSNIAN government came under fresh attack from its own people yesterday, as the confrontation between President Alija Izetbegovic and his rival, Mr Fikrat Abdic, leader of the north-western enclave of Bihac, turned violent. Forces loyal to Mr Izetbegovic stormed a radio station held by forces loyal to Mr Abdic and shot dead a local policeman. A UN forces spokesman said thousands of pro- and anti-government demonstrators had taken to the streets at Bihac. Mr Abdic, long an opponent of Mr Izetbegovic, was sacked from Bosnia's collective leadership after he declared that the enclave, which is surrounded by Serb territory, would be independent of Sarajevo. Mr Ejup Ganic, a member of the Bosnian government, Mr Rasim Delic, Bosnian army commander, and the Moslem Iman of Sarajevo are to meet Mr Abdic for UN-sponsored negotiations today. In another blow to Bosnia's Moslem-led government, the Bosnian Serb leader, Mr Radovan Karadzic, confirmed that his Serb assembly had withdrawn the offer to hand over land seized in the 18-month war. The Bosnian Serb assembly, on Saturday night in Banja Luka, the north-western Serb stronghold, voted to withdraw all concessions to its outgunned Moslem rivals, following the rejection by the Bosnian assembly of proposed maps. The assembly of the self-styled Bosnian Serb state, dealt another death blow to the Geneva peace process, making clear its opposition to despatch of foreign troops, including Nato forces, to Serb-held territory. Deployment of US and Nato troops is seen as crucial to the enforcement of any peace plan. But, as a sign of pressure on the Bosnian Serbs from Belgrade, which is eager to reach a settlement to lift the UN sanctions on Serbia, the Serbs said they wanted to remain part of the peace process. In spite of fears that the latest breakdown in peace talks would set off more fighting, the UN said Bosnia remained relatively calm, with a ceasefire around Mostar apparently holding. But troops were reported massing in the Serb-controlled enclave of Krajina in Croatia, where the mandate for the UN peacekeepers patrolling the region is due to run out tomorrow. Croatia says the UN peacekeepers should disarm the Serbs or withdraw entirely.</p>

			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / Italy plans tough crisis budget THE Italian government has begun toughening the 1993 budget and preparing measures to tackle the country's financial crisis following a wave of criticism over the devaluation of the lira. The moves were made against the background of renewed pressure on the lira, nervousness on the Milan stock exchange and a slight rise in short-term interest rates after Monday's dip in the wake of devaluation. The government's original intention in July was to find an extra L83,000bn (Pounds 37bn) in the 1993 budget to contain the public sector deficit, but this has been overtaken by events. High interest rates in defence of the lira have added to the cost of funding the deficit, while the concerted wave of speculation against the Italian currency has emphasised that only a tough budget will restore some credibility in the markets. On present trends economists estimate the government would have to find at least L100,000bn in fresh revenues and spending cuts. But if interest rates do not drop this may only hold the deficit down to 10.5 per cent of GDP - almost double the EC average. Among the measures being considered are an immediate deindexation of the state pensions scheme and the capping of health spending. The finance ministry is also considering a cut in the number of permitted tax breaks for companies and a rise in corporate income tax. President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, after a meeting yesterday with Mr Giuliano Amato, the prime minister, threw his weight behind an austerity package and said the crisis required 'the maximum understanding from politicians and society in general.' The president said the government should introduce two laws to show the burden of sacrifice falls equably - a law dealing with political corruption and one to end pay privileges of state concerns' board members who have been removed from their jobs. The meeting also appeared to be designed to show the president's backing for the prime minister as rumours swept Rome yesterday that the government was about to resign.</p>

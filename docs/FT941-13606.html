			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / People: Taube shifts investment gear Lord Rothschild's investment guru Nils Taube, who turned 65 last year, is relinquishing his executive directorship of investment company St James's Place Capital. But despite that, he is adamant that he will be devoting no less time to his role as principal investment adviser to the J Rothschild group. 'I was getting in at 7.15 am; maybe I will now get in at 7.20,' quips Taube, who explains that the main point is that he is changing his 'contractual relationship' with the company, moving to receiving fees rather being a salaried employee. For those still in doubt, he emphasises: 'I can assure you I am not retiring.' Taube adds that a team of just three, including himself, are now managing marketable assets of around Pounds 1bn. He had resented spending 'more and more time on administrative matters that had nothing to do with investment'. He is retaining other outside posts, including his non-executive directorship of George Soros's Quantum Fund.</p>

The last similar destroyer of the first rank was built at  the  "Northern Shipyard" joint-stock company back in the time of the  USSR. The "Besstrashnyy" will become part of the Northern Fleet,  where several such ships are already based.    Viktor Chernomyrdin noted that task of building the new  Russian fleet must be resolved under extremely difficult  conditions in connection with the loss of a number of military  bases in the Baltic, Black Sea, and Caspian Sea and also with  the complex economic situation and the difficult political  circumstances.    In commenting on the raising of the Andreyevskiy flag on the  destroyer "Besstrashnyy," Andrey Kokoshin said that this was a  real celebration for the Armed Forces.    It was very difficult for the Ministry of Defense and the  personnel of "Northern Shipyard" to complete the construction of  the "Besstrashnyy" under the conditions of the extremely acute  situation with respect to the financing of the state defense  order, noted Andrey Kokoshin. The leadership of the Ministry of  Defense continually had to follow the course of the work and  provide for even financing. Presently, analogous work is being  done with respect to the completion of the heavy nuclear missile  cruiser "Petr Velikiy," a destroyer, and an antisubmarine ship.</p>

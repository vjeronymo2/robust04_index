			<p><P> May 7, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAMES FLANIGAN: WORLD ECONOMY FEELS IMPACT OF PERESTROIKA  </P> <P> Will Gorbachev survive, and does it matter anyway? In perestroika's latest  episode, U.S. Secretary of Defense Richard Cheney said a week ago that Soviet  leader Mikhail Gorbachev's attempts to reform his country's economy would lead  to his downfall.  </P> <P> Cheney's comment was countered somewhat by President Bush, saying he told  Gorbachev that we in America want perestroika to succeed and backing that  sentiment with an OK for subsidies on grain sales to the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> But more than American exports will be affected by Gorbachev's policies, which  bring the challenge of change to the United States as well as to the Soviet  Union. The promise of lowered East-West tensions is already producing second  thoughts about NATO missiles in West Germany. And no doubt it is also  contributing to the prospect of long-term shrinkage in the U.S. defense  industry -- a $300-billion-a-year mainstay of the U.S. economy.  </P> <P> Gorbachev, in short, makes a difference. In speculating on his possible  downfall, Cheney wasn't arguing for higher defense spending but cautioning  against a hasty withdrawal of U.S. troops from Europe lest today's sweet talk  is replaced by tomorrow's growl.  </P> <P> Opening up closed economies is difficult and perilous. The exhilaration of free  markets is soon replaced by confusion and rage at rising prices. What people  don't realize is that inflation has always been there but evident in shortages  rather than high prices.  </P> <P> "There are two kinds of inflation," an official of East Germany's government  once explained succinctly, "the kind in which I cannot buy because the price is  too high and the kind in which I cannot buy because the products are not  there." Perestroika, literally restructuring, means awakening from illusion.  But that doesn't make it less painful.  </P> <P> Next will come unemployment, as state-owned railroads and airlines, factories  and offices try to lay off surplus staff and become efficient. Still, with all  the difficulties, voters in Moscow (and students in Beijing) are calling for  further change -- having tasted economic freedom, they want political  self-determination. Ultimately, what is going on in the reforming Communist  world will present profound challenges to U.S. foreign and economic policies.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Weakening Hold on Asia  </P> <P> "Within 25 years, if not sooner, the Russian empire will have disappeared,"  says Peter F. Drucker. "In fact, the more Gorbachev's perestroika succeeds in  reviving a decaying Russian economy, the faster will the Russian empire  unravel."  </P> <P> Drucker is best known as an authority on business management, but he is more an  historian of economics and culture. At 79, he is publishing his 25th book this  month, "The New Realities," a collection of essays based on lectures he gave  last fall at the Claremont Graduate School about the implications of the  information age.  </P> <P> In one of the book's arresting essays, Drucker writes not only of the Soviet  Union's changing relationship with Eastern Europe but the weakening hold of the  European Russian leadership over vast stretches of Asia, as the Russian half of  the Soviet population grows at one-third the rate of the country's Central  Asian peoples.  </P> <P> The Soviet Union is not a melting pot society; the ruling Russians don't even  equip Asian soldiers with live ammunition. One reason Gorbachev offered to  reduce Soviet troop strength by 500,000, says Drucker, is that lacking Russian  youths to fill the ranks, he would have to recruit and arm Asians.  </P> <P> So Russia is changing in more ways than one. Which means, writes Drucker, that  the United States has to rethink 44 years of foreign and economic policies that  centered on the Soviet Union. Protecting countries from Soviet power is  difficult, after all, when they no longer think that they need protection.  </P> <P> West Germany is already turning eastward toward the vast and underdeveloped  Soviet market. The Soviet Union has a gross national product of about $2.2  trillion, comparable to that of Japan and double that of West Germany. But 286  million Soviet citizens have a standard of living -- GNP per person -- that is  less than half that of Japan or Germany. Germany's second thoughts about NATO  are related, of course, to its ambitions for trade and ties with the East.  </P> <P> In Asia, too, things are changing. Japan wants to build its own fighter plane,  the FSX. Does the United States support this reach for independence or demand  continued dependence?  </P> <P> Of course, all these developments are positive. They mean that the American  postwar policy of fostering economic recovery in Europe and Japan has  succeeded. There's a lot of truth in President Bush's remarks last week that  "the United States should hope that economic reform succeeds everywhere in the  world. With its emphasis on incentives and market economics, economic reform  leads to more freedom."  </P> <P> What does it all mean? Militarily, America won the war; philosophically, it has  won the postwar. Now it is challenged to come up with an encore.  </P></p>

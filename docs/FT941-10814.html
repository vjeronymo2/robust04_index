			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / Heads 'lose out' on pay awards Many school governing bodies are too embarrassed to give discretionary awards to head teachers and their deputies, according to a report by the Institute of Manpower Studies. The report, based on a survey of 1,600 heads and deputies, estimates that senior staff in almost two-thirds of schools in England and Wales went for more than a year without a formal salary review. Discretionary additions to national awards can be made for a number of reasons, including overall performance and levels of responsibility. Mr John Stock, co-author of the report, said: 'It seems that many governing bodies find discussing the pay of their head embarrassing and demeaning - which means that many heads and deputies lose out.' Some respondents said governors had no understanding of what was involved in the job and no experience of pay determination. Mr Stock said the recommendation of annual review by a standing committee of governors, made last week by the school teachers review body, should help clarify the process. Specialists charged with slimming down the national curriculum have not cut enough, the government Schools Curriculum and Assessment Authority said yesterday. Sir Ron Dearing, its chairman, announced last month that substantial cuts were to be made in the prescribed curriculum for schools in England and Wales, so that 20 per cent of classroom time could be left to teachers' discretion. But Mr Chris Woodhead, chief executive of the authority, said plans submitted by subject working groups had not been sufficiently ruthless. Separate working groups have returned the draft proposals to subject specialists for further cuts. A head for figures? A survey of head and deputy head teachers. IMS Report 262 1994 Pounds 35.

			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Brady backs stock-index futures bill MOVES by three US stock exchanges to lower margin requirements on stock index futures have rekindled a simmering controversy over the regulation of such contracts. Mr Nicholas Brady, the US secretary of the treasury, who contends that stock index futures increase stock market volatility, has stepped back into the fray to urge Congress to pass legislation granting the Federal Reserve authority over stock index futures margins. The legislation has been languishing for more than a year. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which trades the widely-used Standard &amp; Poor's 500 stock index future, and the Chicago Board of Trade, which trades a Major Market Index future, recently lowered their initial margin requirements for such contracts. The New York Futures Exchange, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the New York Stock Exchange, which trades a NYSE Composite Index, lowered its margin requirements last month. The exchanges argue that stock index futures margins are too high and that lowering them will not increase volatility. However, a number of influential senators are pressing for reform. They say it would take only a single day of big losses - paired with lowered futures margins - 'to reignite public controversies similar to those of 1987 and 1989.' The senators have urged the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the futures industry regulator, to determine if current margin levels are adequate.</p>

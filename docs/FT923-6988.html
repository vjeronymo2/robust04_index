			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / Woolwich scheme lets 5,000 keep homes THE WOOLWICH, the third largest building society, said yesterday that its in-house programme for those facing repossession has saved more than 5,000 mortgage holders from losing their homes since the start of the year. The society, which has 512,300 mortgage customers, said the 5,000 were more than 12 months in arrears with their payments and would normally have been evicted. Last year Woolwich repossessed 2,853 homes. So far this year its repossessions are running about 20 per cent below last year's level. Under the Woolwich scheme branches take responsibility for visiting borrowers with serious arrears problems. Borrowers are encouraged to talk to all the other lenders to whom they owe money and reschedule their debts. The society said: 'We are looking after customers who cannot pay all their mortgages but can pay some of what they owe.' The 5,000 customers do not have a guarantee that they will never lose their homes if they keep paying. The society merely says it expects at some stage to be able to make permanent financial arrangements for them to keep their homes. Woolwich said it saw some hope over arrears. Its two-month arrears were currently 20 per cent lower than they were a year ago and at their lowest since February 1988.</p>

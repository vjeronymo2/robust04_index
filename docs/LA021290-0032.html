			<p><P> February 12, 1990, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SOCKERS' LATE COMEBACK NOT ENOUGH  </P> <P> Trailing, 4-0, with just 10:19 remaining in regulation play, the Sockers came  up with their best clutch performance of the season before dropping a 5-4  double-overtime decision Sunday afternoon to the Cleveland Crunch.  </P> <P> "It's never over until it's over," said victorious Crunch Player-Coach Kai  Haaskivi, who watched from the bench as his team struggled to come up with the  victory.  </P> <P> The loss, at the Richfield Coliseum in front of 4,335 fans, was the Sockers  12th in 15 road games this season. It snapped a four-game winning streak  against the expansion Crunch. Two of the Sockers three road victories came  against the Crunch. The third was against the expansion St. Louis Storm.  </P> <P> After building a 4-0 lead against the Sockers, with just 10:19 remaining in  regulation play, the Crunch was forced into double overtime before team captain  Mike Sweeney sent the Sockers packing with a power-play goal just 1:54 into the  second overtime.  </P> <P> Sweeney, who had crossed from the left of the Sockers' goal to the corner of  the Sockers' penalty area, took a pass from teammate Pato Margetic and then  took three steps toward the middle line before firing a shot from straight on  past goalie Zoltan Toth.  </P> <P> While Sweeney was the building's happiest occupant after the team's victory lap  around the Coliseum carpet, the most unhappy was Sockers' Coach Ron Newman, who  was trying to find justification for a two-minute tripping penalty handed  defender Branko Segota by referee Casey Frankewicz with just one second  remaining in the first overtime.  </P> <P> After the contest ended, Newman charged onto the field and ran up to  Frankewicz, grabbing his hand and shaking it. "It was bloody - - - - - - - -,"  Newman said, of the call which gave the Crunch a man-advantage in the second  overtime.  </P> <P> "I shook his hand and said to him, 'Congratulations on your win.' The man  totally forgot the main rule of calling a penalty as opposed to just a simple  foul -- a player's intent. That was the worst time he could have made a call  like that. If he wants to call it a foul, fine. But pulling a card with just  one second left is bloody B.S."  </P> <P> The Crunch jumped out to a 2-0 lead in the first half, with defender Bernie  James scoring at 3:49 of the first quarter, with a shot from 15-feet out.  </P> <P> Sweeney then added a goal at 6:44 of the opening quarter, with a 15-footer  straight on off a pass from Michael King.  </P> <P> The Crunch then scored again at 5:54 of the third quarter, with Hector Marinaro  bouncing the ball off Toth and into the net from five-feet away. Michael King  then scored his 30th goal of the season with 4:41 gone in the fourth quarter,  giving the Crunch a 4-0 lead.  </P> <P> The next 10 minutes will remain in the mind of Haaskivi for a long time, as the  Sockers scored four goals over a 5:25 period to tie the score at 4-4, sending  the game into overtime.  </P> <P> Midfielder Thien Nguyen got it started with his first goal of the season, at  6:13 of the fourth quarter. Cacho then followed with the Sockers' second goal  at 9:45, followed by Steve Zungul's third goal of the season, at 10:40. Then  came Zoran Karic's game-tieing effort from 10-feet out to the left of Crunch  goalie P.J. Johns, which deflected off Johns with just 3:17 remaining in  regulation.  </P> <P> "We got caught looking," Haaskivi admitted. "They're a great team and great  teams never quit. I saw my worst nightmare happening right before my eyes and I  felt a little helpless.  </P> <P> "But I couldn't be prouder of the way we responded in the overtime. We sucked  it up and went out and played determined soccer at a time we needed a total  team effort.  </P> <P> "I can't say we were exactly thrilled with a few calls ourselves. When Zungul  scored their third goal, they had seven players on the field and didn't get  caught. We argued with the officials, but nothing was changed."  </P></p>

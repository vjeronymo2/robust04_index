			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Private View: How Beauty was defiled by the Nazi Beast - Film-maker Leni Riefenstahl was the darling of Hitler and Goebbels. She is still trying to explain why HERE IS the woman Hitler embraced on the beach one night in 1932, and at whose feet Goebbels grovelled with unrequited lust. Here is the girl who danced for Max Reinhardt, the film actress who drove men to the verge of suicide, who got Marlene Dietrich her role in The Blue Angel, and whose talent secured her one triumph after another . . . until her illusions and career were shattered by war. Leni Riefenstahl, one of the cinema's greatest documentarists, this week published the English edition* of her memoirs, five years after their debut in Germany. Visually inspired she may be, but one reads her written testament - nearly 700 pages - with mounting incredulity. The style is breathlessly banal, the narrative self-obsessed, the vision monocular. Even the hairsbreadth escapes  -Leni falling off mountains and ice floes, her flying accidents, her car crash - read like fiction. Her publisher's choice of title, The Sieve of Time, seems cruelly appropriate. Leni Riefenstahl, harried and maligned even after the Allies exculpated her of any complicity in Nazi crimes, emerges on paper as her own worst advocate. In person, now 90, she is much more plausible but no less startling. She was wearing skintight black leggings and a blue shirt with gemstone buttons. She dabbed at her lips with a handkerchief. She looked nervous and frail. But Riefenstahl is no poor old lady. She had just returned from a diving trip to the Maldives with her long-standing boyfriend, Horst Kettner. He is 40 years her junior. Persuaded it was safe to be left alone with me, Riefenstahl, in poor but adequate English, became passionate and confiding. Occasionally she extended a bony finger to tap a point home. But what she confided was what she has been saying for nearly 47 years. I commented that the book read like a protracted defence. 'Naturally. It must be a defence. I have to do this. But that was not the reason I wrote it. The reason was that I can't inform hundreds of journalists about my life. Now I can say to them 'read my memoirs''. Did you not write it also to explain your life to yourself? 'No. I had only one idea. I had to write the truth. What really happened. I am not a good writer. My gift is my eyes, the picture, film. I hated writing. I wanted to explain my feelings and the difficulties I have had. Because of the attacks after the war I was not able to make films and that was so hard for me, because my life is in my art. If you take a fish from the water and put it in the sand, the fish can't die and he can't live. It was so hard. What I read after the war about me - none of it was Leni Riefenstahl. It was a different person.' Did you not discover a different view of your past? 'I don't think so. How can I change my opinion? People and journalists say 'She won't say she's guilty.' But, please, what have I done that is bad? Tell me what I have done]' You could be accused of being very naive. 'No. I don't think that I am naive. The only thing to make clear was at the beginning one admired Hitler, yes? But I have admired him along with millions of others. How am I guilty and the others not? That is one thing. For this I can't say I am guilty, because all around me were enthusiastic.' I thought of her frequent meetings, public and private, with Hitler, Goebbels and other Nazi henchmen. Wasn't she different? 'Look,' she interrupted. 'The second thing is only my film, The Triumph of the Will. There were not even any Jewish laws at this time. In my film there was not one word of Nazi ideology, only the documentary pictures of what happened. Nothing was said against Jewish people.' I had seen Triumph of the Will, her film of the 1934 Nuremberg rally. Cinematically, it is stunning, and it led to her equally stunning record of the Berlin Olympics two years later. Riefenstahl says she made Triumph, her two other films of rallies, and even Olympia, under duress. But to claim that Triumph is neither political nor propagandist is so brazen as to be absurd. The film is a passionate, unremitting distillation of the Nazis' mawkish, brutal, supremacist fantasy. I remembered, too, her account of Hitler coming to tea and flipping through her copy of Mein Kampf with her critical notes in its margins. But you had read Mein Kampf, I said. 'Ja. But not the whole book; only some chapters before '32.' So you knew what Hitler's ideas were? 'Yes, but, look. I will tell you. Only people who have lived in this time are able to understand the time. Because Germany was so poor, so lost, all its people unhappy, six million without work and hungry on the street. I didn't admire Hitler for his ideas; no, it was only for his social policies. It was as if someone in England promised . . .' Yes, I understand. But you say yourself you realised Hitler could be dangerous. 'I was not sure.' I'm not passing judgment, Frau Riefenstahl. I want to know whether now, at 90, you think you made a mistake in approaching Hitler, in writing that letter to him. 'Why? I was very happy to meet him. I was in the beginning like other people impressed by him. How can I change my feelings? If I would say now I am guilty, I am unhappy, I made mistakes, then I would be a liar. 'All people in Germany say: 'Nobody was a Nazi. Nobody did like this (she half-raised her arm in the Nazi salute). I was never there, I was against Hitler.' I am one of the rare people who has the courage to say the truth. And I think that is important. It is better than lying. 'It would have been better for me to say I was guilty, that I made a mistake. Then I would have no problems now. But why I don't say this is because it is not true. I didn't think for one moment that he would do the things he did later against the Jewish people and so on.' You suffered a lot after the war because of your association with top Nazis. 'Naturally.' And you have been suffering until . . . I don't know when you will be free of this. 'I will never be free. Never, in my life. Because I can't understand why they want people to say what is not true.' I suggested that, like Marlene Dietrich, she could have gone to America. Riefenstahl corrected me. Dietrich had to go to the US for her career and denounced the Nazis from there because she had been better informed of the truth by her circle. Riefenstahl's own Jewish friends - they loyally defended her later - had initially been impressed by Hitler and advised her not to leave Germany, she said. You could have followed your instinct and kept away from these men. 'But it was too late.' Riefenstahl did not join the Party, for, as she reports telling Hitler to his face, she disliked his racism. According to her book, she lived 'as if inside an egg'. So consumed was she by her art, she read nothing in the papers, heard nothing on the radio - and there was no TV. The outbreak of war took her by surprise. The interview was turning into a fruitless interrogation, so I asked about her art. You love physical beauty, I suggested. She saw a trap. 'Beauty, not physical beauty,' she corrected. 'People say I made my Olympic athletes so beautiful. I am not God. They were like that.' When you were a girl, you loved fairy tales. Your films also have this air of fantasy. 'You are right. It was very hard for me to adapt to reality. Then my world was the dance. Nothing else existed for me.' When I her asked her why she did not portray poverty or ugliness, she replied that her films were a way of saying Yes to life. 'Poor people, ugly people or sick people need hope, films that are positive. I think for an artist it's much more difficult to make a good positive film than to make a good negative one.' Did Hitler share your ideal of beauty? 'Not one little bit.' We discussed men. You've had many lovers, I said. 'Many? Not so much.' She laughed. They were passionate affairs but often you were betrayed. Why? 'My profession. To make these very difficult films, to work 18 hours in the cutting room, I had no private life. My life, my work, was always very very hard. The men I loved wanted to sleep with me and I had to work.' I thought of Goebbels' seduction attempts. Did you like Goebbels? 'Ugh] Never. From the first moment not. He hated me. If he spoke well of my films, that is a different thing. But he hated me because I didn't love him, didn't like him and he was jealous that Hitler liked me.' After the war Riefenstahl was arrested, interrogated and freed. But her career was blighted and she spent years fighting libel actions. Among the accusations hurled at her were that she had witnessed a massacre of Jews in Poland, that she used concentration camp inmates for her film Tiefland, that she danced naked at the Berchtesgaden, that she was Hitler's mistress. All this she sets down in the book. Shunned in Germany, boycotted almost everywhere, she found refuge and affection with a remote Sudanese tribe, the Nuba, whose primitive innocence and naked rituals she has photographed. 'My Nuba', she calls them. When I suggested that she never really understood other people she thought I was accusing her of lacking sympathy for the poor. Then she declared: 'I understand my enemies. I am not surprised. I understand that the Jews hate me. The problem is they don't see the difference between the ideas of Hitler and Leni Riefenstahl, and they are absolutely contraire.' You had everything a woman could want, I said. Beauty, brains, artistic sense, energy, discipline. (Riefenstahl smiled with pleasure). What are your faults, do you think? 'Maybe I am too much of a perfectionist. And I am too concentrated on one thing . . . egocentric. My desire to make a new work. Not to have success, that's not so important. Money is not interesting.' I asked her directly if she was not ashamed of her fascination with Hitler. 'It was a mistake]' Finally she had said it. 'Looking back I must say this, but I can't say it was not true. It was a mistake and it disturbed my life. It has disturbed my life. 'It is the story of my film The Blue Light. Junta (the heroine) loves the blue light: it is like an ideal. Leni thought Hitler was an ideal. She thought he was a good man who was bringing peace and then, like Junta, she saw it was wrong. Junta dies. It is the same for me. This is my destiny.' Every word of her memoirs may be literally true, down to the verbatim reports of Hitler's conversations. And yet . . . something seems to have slipped through the sieve of time. It is as if there is another Leni Riefenstahl whom she is unable to face yet whom she must take with her, resolutely, to the grave. *The Sieve of Time; Quartet Books, Pounds 30.</p>

			<p><P> May 13, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROTECTING TELEPHONE ANONYMITY  </P> <P> By offering a device that would identify a caller, we are taking one more step  toward the day when our lives are monitored totally by Big Brother.  </P> <P> This plan would almost negate the benefits afforded by having an unlisted  telephone number and possibly subject telephone users to a rash of unwanted  solicitations. I feel that there should be public hearings conducted by the  Public Utilities Commission, so that everyone may have the opportunity of  airing their opinions and that we are able to carefully weigh all the aspects  of such a program.  </P> <P> There is no doubt that being able to identify a caller has many benefits,  particularly in the case of obscene, crank calls and overzealous salesmen.  However, the price we pay in our loss of privacy may be too great. The  telephone has been a wonderful invention that has greatly enhanced our lives,  but it can also be an intrusive method to deprive us of privacy and anonymity.  Some safeguards must be offered before we are able to reap the benefits of this  system.  </P> <P> BYRON SLATER  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / Construction Contracts: New French headquarters for Nestle BOVIS SA, a wholly owned subsidiary of the P&amp;O company Bovis International, has won an Pounds 85m management contract to build the new 650,000 sq ft headquarters for Nestle France at Noisiel, Seine-et-Marne, 18km east of Paris. The 30-month project, which starts on site in February 1994, involves the refurbishment of a group of listed 19th-century industrial buildings that line the banks of the River Marne and the construction of a 200,000 sq ft building. The 34-acre development, which includes an 8-acre island, will welcome 1,850 Nestle staff from several subsidiaries in January 1996. Nestle has made the restoration of the listed buildings one of its main priorities. One of these, a mill built in 1871, will be fully restored to show the original hydroelectric machinery in the basement. An area of the bank alongside the mill will be transformed into a square that will feature the foundations of the old factory's main chimney. The upper floor of the mill will be fitted out to provide offices for the Nestle board. One of the first reinforced concrete structures built on the island will also be fully restored. Built in 1906, the 'Cathedral' was designed by Stephen Sauvestre, a partner of G. Eiffel, famous for tower construction. It is linked directly to the other buildings on the site by an arched concrete bridge that has a span of 146ft. The length of the span was believed to be a record at the beginning of this century. Internal fittings will be the same in the refurbished and new buildings offering Nestle's staff space, a high level of comfort and the latest communications technology. Bovis SA will also manage the fit-out.</p>

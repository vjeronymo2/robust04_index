			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "Manmohan's Statement Criticised"] </F>   [Text] New Delhi, March 7. Opposition members in the Rajya  Sabha, particularly the Janata Dal and the CPI (Communist Party  of India) today objected to the Finance Minister, Dr. Manmohan  Singh, making a statement in Patiala about the acceptance of the  recommendations of the Malhotra Committee, which went into the  issue of restructuring the insurance sector.    Raising the matter during zero hour, Mr. Jaipal Reddy, JD  (Janata Dal), said the Finance Minister had said in the course  of his budget speech that the Malhotra Committee recommendations  were under the active consideration of the Government.    When Parliament was in session, the Finance Minister had  announced in Patiala that most of the committee's  recommendations had been accepted.    Saying that the Finance Minister should have informed  Parliament first, Mr. Reddy said he had committed contempt of  Parliament.    Mr. Reddy was strongly supported by Mr. M.A. Baby, CPI(M),  who said the Minister should not have made the statement outside  Parliament. -- PTI</p>

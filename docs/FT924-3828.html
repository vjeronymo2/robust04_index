			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Foreign bargain hunters rally Hong Kong stocks HONG KONG share prices broke their steep downward trend yesterday after heavy overseas buying. But there was no expectation of a resolution of the row between Britain and China which has shattered confidence in the colony. Meanwhile stockbrokers called in an open letter for the withdrawal of Governor Chris Patten's proposed democratic reforms and for his resignation. Support for the letter came from Chim Pui-chung, the financial community's representative on Hong Kong's Legislative Council Mr Chim claimed strong backing from some of the smaller local brokerages. However, international brokers said it was not their role to make political judgments based on the performance of the stock market. The Hang Seng Index - the colony's barometer of blue chip stock prices  - climbed 289.89 points, or 5.82 per cent, yesterday, but recovered less than a third of the week's losses. Mr Archie Hart, research director at Crosby Securities, said: 'This is a knee-jerk reaction. I don't see any reason why the market should sustain this rally.' Confidence was hit last week by China's threats to reverse contracts handed out by the 'Hong Kong-British' Government before 1997, and to invalidate the Sino-British Joint Declaration. The Joint Liaison Group - the Sino-British forum for discussing the transfer of Hong Kong to China - is to meet on Tuesday and some investors are hoping that it could break the deadlock. However, government officials do not see scope for any fine-tuning of the Chinese insistence that Mr Patten unconditionally withdraws his proposals. China's call has found significant support within a business community which has suffered short-term losses from the effects of the uncertainty, and which is concerned over the potential ripple effect into the economy and the property market. Some of the larger international broking houses reported record overseas buying yesterday and turnover hit Dollars HK5.4bn (Pounds 462m)one of the highest figures ever recorded on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Mr Richard Witts, managing director of local brokerage United Mok Ying Kie, said: 'It is difficult to resist buying at these levels; but we are not out of the woods yet.' Yvonne Preston adds from Beijing: Lord Howe, the former British foreign secretary, yesterday rallied to the support of Mr Patten, criticising China for its 'oversimplified denunciations and rejections' of the reform proposals. Lord Howe, who was foreign secretary when the Sino-British Joint Declaration on Hong Kong was negotiated in 1984, said in Beijing of the present angry confrontation: 'These situations don't continue indefinitely without the prospect of any forward movement.' Lord Howe was leading a six-man British human rights delegation to China. The visit comes just over a year after Prime Minister John Major's warning to the Chinese that the British government intended to maintain 'unremitting, unrelenting and continuing pressure' over human rights. On Monday the first US congressional delegation to visit China since the election of Mr Bill Clinton as president warned Chinese leaders to improve their human rights record or risk losing their most-favoured-nation trade status with the US.</p>

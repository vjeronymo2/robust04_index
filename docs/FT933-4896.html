			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / Jordan deplores social opt-out MR BILL Jordan, president of the AEEU craft union, yesterday told the TUC that the UK's 'opt-out' from the next stage of European social legislation would prove 'untenable' in the long run. 'The British government will not stop progress and they won't stop British companies being affected,' he said. He said the unions continued to support European economic and social integration. The Congress voted to establish an office in Brussels.</p>

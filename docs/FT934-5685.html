			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Survey of Denmark (7): Seven lean years - Hilary Barnes, how the banks weathered the storm The Danish banks have come through a seven-year recession with their financial integrity intact and, in contrast to the situation in the other Nordic countries, the state has not had to provide either capital or guarantees to keep the banking sector afloat. The reasons, said Mr Knud Sorensen, chief executive of the country's largest bank, Den Danske Bank, who is also chairman of the Danish Banker's Association, is sound legislation and a very thorough bank inspectorate. 'Compared with what happened in Norway, Sweden and Finland, Danish banks have fared very well indeed,' he said. But in a country which still has about 180 banks and savings banks (many of them tiny) to serve 5.1m people, dozens of banks have closed over the past 10 years. In most cases the process has been fairly painless. Other banks have taken over banks whose capital adequacy has fallen below the legal minimum (nine per cent currently, falling to eight per cent in 1995). Depositors (covered by an insurance scheme for deposits of up to DKr250,000) have not lost their money, although in several cases shareholders have. 'The banking community takes pride in finding solutions which do not involve direct state aid,' said Mr Sorensen. But resistance by healthy banks to saving their weaker brethren is growing. 'After a number of years when we have had to set aside considerable sums to cover losses, willingness and capability to assist is rather limited,' said Mr Sorensen. 'We have reached a stage where it is hard to justify to your own shareholders, staff and customers that you have to support banks which have taken too many risks. We will do a lot out of responsibility to society, but there is a limit.' Whether this limit has been definitively reached is something which only time can tell, and the matter may not be put to serious test in the immediate future as this year has favoured the banks, which suffered a combined loss of DKr10.9bn in 1992. Rising bond and share prices have boosted investment income, and cost cutting and lower interest rates have contributed to better operating margins. All the big banks, Danske, Unibank, Bikuben and Jyske Bank, were back in the black in the first half. 'The present situation in Danish banking is not that bad. We look forward with some optimism to 1994 and 1993 should be a fairly good year,' said Mr Sorensen. The difficulty of rescuing troubled banks was highlighted this autumn by the case of Himmerlandsbanken, a small bank serving the North Jutland town of Hobro, where it had a market share of around 40 per cent. The bank collapsed. Shareholders and bondholders lost their money, but the bank was enabled to keep going when it was taken over by Sparekassen Nordjylland (Spar Nord), the North Jutland savings bank, after some hard persuasion by the government. Spar Nord believes it received a promise from the government that in return for preventing the closure of Himmerland, Spar Nord could make a tax loss deduction of DKr173m. But when muck-raking politicians began questioning the legality of the deduction, the government denied having made the promise. The case came close to costing the minister for revenue, Mr Ole Stavad, a Social Democrat, his job, and it may yet do so. A judicial inquiry has been set up to look into the misunderstanding and Mr Stavad's political life is on the line. Himmerland has been accused of trying to save itself by selling bonds in the bank with money lent to its customers for the purpose, and without the risks being properly explained to investors. As a consequence, the government has tabled legislation which will make it illegal for a bank, from the moment that a bond issue is announced, to offer to finance investment in the bonds. With many banks needing to replace bond-financed subordinated (tier 2) capital with new loans in order to meet the requirements of BIS capital adequacy rules, the events at Himmerlandsbanken and the political reaction to it have come at a bad moment for the banks. 'Right now is not the best climate in which to raise capital,' said Mr Sorensen. 'But things will calm down again. One should not draw the conclusion from Himmerlandsbanken that other banks will not be able to refinance.' Meanwhile, attempts are being made to find a solution to a problem at Varde Bank, which serves the west coast port of Esbjerg, the country's 10th largest bank with assets of about DKr11bn. Despite a capital restructuring in 1992, when the Central Bank and a consortium of larger banks guaranteed the bank's capital and liquidity, the bank's capital adequacy ratio has slipped below the legal minimum again and action to save the bank is imminent. 'I can only say that we shall try to adopt the most sensible solution,' said Mr Sorensen.</p>

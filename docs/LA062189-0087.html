			<p><P> June 21, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> San Jose Mayor Tom McEnery said he will ask the City Council to increase the  reward to $25,000 for information leading to the capture of the killer of a  16-year-old Japanese exchange student. A private organization called Crime  Stoppers has already offered a $5,000 reward in the death of Ai Toyoshima, who  was shot in the chest when she got off a bus on Friday. "This is the type of  mindless, senseless violence that cannot be tolerated in our city or our  society," the mayor said.  </P></p>

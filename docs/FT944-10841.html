			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Economic upturn may falter The recovery could be set to falter in the months ahead, if leading cyclical indicators for October, published yesterday by the Central Statistical Office, are to be believed. The shorter leading index, supposed to predict turning points in the economy about five months ahead, turned down slightly last month after rising from May to September. The longer leading index, which is said to indicate turning points about 13 months ahead, has been declining since July. They have, however, proved erratic guides.</p>

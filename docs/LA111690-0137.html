			<p><P> November 16, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DANA PARSONS: 2 GRANDFATHERS -- UNDERSTANDING CAME EARLY AND LATE  </P> <P> On a cool day in late September of 1978, my grandfather died at 90. He was a  simple man with a third-grade education who walked 2 miles every day to his job  as a custodian for the railroad.  </P> <P> We have an old family photo of me as a 3-year-old combing the eight or nine  strands of hair that grandpa had. As a teen-ager, I had a running joke with him  based on my grandma's passion for bingo, which she indulged in three or four  nights a week at the local parlor. Grandpa would phone and invite me over, and  I'd ask him if grandma was going to be home, knowing full well she was probably  at bingo.  </P> <P> "No, she's down at Billy Graham's tonight," he would say, always delivering the  joke with his high-pitched laugh.  </P> <P> Good ol' Grandpa.  </P> <P> That's essentially how he remained in my consciousness until well into adult  life, when I gave my first serious thought to the rhythms of his life. Born in  1888, married in 1911, devastated at 41 by the Depression. The father of four  children. In my mind's eye, I pictured him at various stages of life -- in good  times, in bad times -- not as a stick figure caricature of a "Grandpa," but as  a flesh-and-blood man of both vice and virtue.  </P> <P> But by the time I pieced together who Grandpa really was, he was already dead.  </P> <P> This remembrance is sparked by a letter from Justin Yoshida, a junior at  Fountain Valley High School. Along with the letter, Justin sent a photocopy of  a front-page photo in The Times from Oct. 10, showing his grandfather with U.S.  Atty. Gen. Richard Thornburgh.  </P> <P> The letter, written Nov. 1 as an outpouring of Justin's thoughts, explains the  rest:  </P> <P> "This weekend, I watched my grandfather in a hospital bed being fed green  liquid through an IV tube. I solemnly stared at his expressionless face for a  long time. His breath came in long, deep gasps, interrupted intermittently by  weak coughs. As I stood by this once powerful man, unexpected emotions ran  through me. I didn't feel deep sorrow. I felt strangely satisfied.  </P> <P> "I clasped his age-scarred hand firmly. He wouldn't have felt my grip  physically, even if he had been awake. My grandfather had suffered two  debilitating strokes in the past week. The first he had been unaware of, or had  shaken off. He was hospitalized for the second one, which had paralyzed his  right side.  </P> <P> "I loved this man deeply. I remember him taking care of his grandchildren  tenderly, even in his old age. He was always special to me, because he was the  oldest person I was related to -- 101 years old. If I had such deep feelings  for him, why did I feel so content while he wasted away at my side?  </P> <P> "Three weeks ago, my grandfather flew to Washington, D.C. My aunt and cousin  escorted him, for he had trouble walking from place to place and was  disoriented. Very recently, he had won an award at Los Angeles Nisei week for  being a pioneer of the Japanese-American community. He had been supportive to  his friends and family all of his life, but now it was his turn to be aided --  in simple walking.  </P> <P> "I pondered for a long time on his benevolence, and it enraged me to think that  this noble man and all others like him had never been recompensed for being  betrayed and interned in prison camps by his own country during the second  world war. The Japanese-Americans, a notoriously proud and honorable ethnic  group, had never been apologized to, in person, for the great losses and  atrocities they suffered as the result of unjustified suspicion and racism. It  was detrimental to their fierce pride and deep honor.  </P> <P> "Now in D.C., my grandfather, Senkichi Yuge, was being televised as the  attorney general of the United States of America offered a war reparations  check and an apology on behalf of our country to him, and shook his hand. It  was the happiest I have ever seen my grandfather, cousin or aunt. As I watched  each first-generation Japanese-American accept both a check and an apology, I  felt what all of my people were experiencing -- fulfillment and relief, but  deep sorrow for all of those who would never receive an apology or reparations  (more than half of all people interned in prison camps have already died).  </P> <P> "Today at school, I realized why I was satisfied for my grandfather. He had  waited his whole life to have his dignity restored, and it finally had been. A  wave of patriotism, unity and pride for my people washed over me as I sat in  U.S. history class. I went home fulfilled, only to receive very serious news.  </P> <P> "My grandfather died today. It was sudden, unexpected and hopefully painless  for him. Perhaps I should feel pensive, morose, gloomy, but my new level of  awareness enables me to have a different insight. I am happy for my  grandfather. He passed away only after his high hopes had been fulfilled. His  people's honor was restored. He was content. And he passed away on All Saints  Day."  </P> <P> Justin and I both had memorable grandfathers. He just got to know his a lot  sooner than I did.  </P> <P>  Dana Parsons' column appears Wednesday, Friday and Sunday.

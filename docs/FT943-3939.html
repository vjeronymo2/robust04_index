			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / Archer not expected at party conference Conservative party managers are relieved that Lord Archer is not expected to attend the party conference next month. The millionaire novelist and former deputy chairman of the party, who was recently the subject of an investigation into alleged insider dealing, has been a prominent figure at past conferences. However, party managers are understood to be relieved he will not be present while questions remain over his role in the purchase of Anglia Television shares. Mr Jeremy Hanley, Tory party chairman, said Lord Archer would not be able to attend next month's gathering in Bournemouth because he was busy with his duties as a working Conservative peer. 'I don't think he is actually coming for the simple reason that the House of Lords are well in session,' he said yesterday on BBC television. 'They have got a running three-line whip and he is a hard-working peer.' Lord Archer's share dealing was investigated by the Department of Trade and Industry after a business associate of Lord Archer - whose wife is a non-executive director of Anglia - made an Pounds 80,000 profit. Although Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, ruled that no action would be taken over the deal, Labour MPs have been pressing for a full explanation of Lord Archer's role in the affair. Mr Hanley warned that Lord Archer may have to bow to pressure and make a full public statement when he returns to Britain from a book-signing tour abroad. 'It is very much a matter for Jeffrey,' he said.</p>

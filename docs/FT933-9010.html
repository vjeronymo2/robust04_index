			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / Observer: No return Who said that the days of mad advances and crazed auctions in the British publishing industry were over? Travel writer Bill Bryson, whose latest work The Lost Continent has been on the best-seller lists for 27 weeks, has just hit gold. Transworld, the UK publishing arm of Bertelsmann, outbid five other publishers desperate to get their hands on Bryson's next tome. Carol Heaton, Bryson's agent, says that it is 'one of the most exciting deals' she has ever been involved in. It certainly sounds like it. Although she refuses to disclose the size of the advance, disappointed bidders suggest that it is around Pounds 240,000. That should enable Bryson to buy a large number of mules or Concorde tickets to help him think up an idea for a book for which there is no synopsis, let alone a title. How about 'Journey into the Unknown'?</p>

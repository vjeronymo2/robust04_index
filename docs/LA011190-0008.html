			<p><P> January 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW WORDS BUT SAME OLD MUSIC  </P> <P> Premier Li Peng took to China's airwaves yesterday to announce that martial law  was being ended in Beijing, seven months after it was decreed in a move to  crush swelling popular protests. As Li finished his 10-minute speech, the  official radio began blaring a concert of triumphant martial music. The irony,  however unintended, was clearly appropriate. Still fully in place, along with a  heavy presence of troops in the capital, are other repressive measures that  make it a crime to strike, to display political posters, to take part in  anti-government demonstrations. Though martial law has been lifted, the Chinese  are no freer the day after that event than they were the day before.  </P> <P> To be sure, not everyone sees it that way. Vice President Dan Quayle, for one,  has hailed the ending of martial law as a "step forward for human rights" and a  vindication of President Bush's policy of engaging in secret high-level  contacts with Chinese leaders starting just a month after the June 4 massacre  of hundreds, and perhaps thousands, of protesters in central Beijing. It may  well be true that National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft, on his two  unannounced visits to Beijing, urged China's leaders to ease up on repression  so as to forestall further punitive responses from Congress. But it's insulting  to all those who died last June or who have been imprisoned or executed since  to confuse an expedient and cosmetic lifting of martial law with any genuine  improvement in human rights.  </P> <P> Economic woes couldn't have been far from the mind of the leadership when it  decided to end martial law. The World Bank is considering a $700-million loan  package to China, which helps explain Li's insistence that his country is now  "stable politically, economically and socially." The White House said Wednesday  that it might well support the Chinese loan application. But federal law  forbids endorsing loans to a country that is a "gross and consistent violator  of human rights." Tragically for its people and unhappily for their economic  future, China continues to fit that bleak description.  </P></p>

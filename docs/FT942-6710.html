			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Market weakness hits Recs It was a rollercoaster ride in the regional electricity companies (Recs) yesterday with a strong performance by the shares finally succumbing to the overall weakness of the market. South Western was a strong feature in early trading, as it announced that it was to seek permission from shareholders to buy back up to 10 per cent of the issued share capital. The shares moved forward on the news and led a sector-wide rise, underpinned by investor enthusiasm for yield plays and recent buy recommendations from several brokers. However, the strong downward momentum in the market, fuelled by the sliding gilts market, sapped the undercurrent of support and the shares gave way. South Western managed to end the session unchanged at 609p, while London slipped 3 to 570p, Eastern 6 to 604p and Manweb 6 to 700p. Analysts said that they expected a further half-dozen of the highly cash-positive Recs to initiate share buy-back schemes. Last month, Eastern completed the first buy-back, purchasing 10 per cent if its share capital.</p>

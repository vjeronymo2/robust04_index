			<p><P> May 23, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REGULATORS AGREE TO SELL LINCOLN S&amp;L STAKE IN TCS  </P> <P> Regulators running insolvent Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan have agreed to sell the  Irvine thrift's stake in TCS Enterprises back to the San Diego  financial-services firm for 30% of the original price, the company's chairman  said Tuesday.  </P> <P> A spokesman for Lincoln's former parent company immediately criticized  regulators for selling too cheaply.  </P> <P> TCS will pay $1.50 a share -- $867,000 in all -- to buy back the 20% interest  that Lincoln acquired in January, 1985. The original purchase price was $5 a  share, or nearly $2.9 million.  </P> <P> Thomas C. Stickel, chairman and chief executive of the firm that bears his  initials, said regulators rejected his offer to pay the S&amp;L the original  purchase price because the terms included payment over 10 years.  </P> <P> "The RTC wanted a cash offer, which we eventually settled upon at $1.50 per  share," Stickel said in a prepared statement. He could not be reached for  further comment.  </P> <P> RTC executives also could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> "This is a great deal for TCS and a terrible deal for the taxpayers," said  Bradley J. Boland, a spokesman for American Continental Corp. in Phoenix. The  company owned Lincoln when regulators seized the thrift on April 14, 1989.  "This is another example of how the taxpayers are being pillaged by the federal  government's incompetence and inability to maximize values for Lincoln's  assets," Boland said.  </P> <P> TCS is the company that hired Lawrence W. Taggart in late 1984 from his job as  commissioner of the state Department of Savings and Loan. It was Taggart who  introduced Stickel to Charles H. Keating Jr., American Continental's chairman.  </P> <P> While TCS has been profitable since Lincoln's investment, it is expected to  announce soon substantially lower earnings for its fiscal second quarter, which  ended April 30. TCS recently has been losing money on a mortgage-packaging  arrangement with Great American Bank, a San Diego savings and loan that has  been crippled by its Arizona real estate operations.  </P> <P> Chris Kraul, San Diego business editor, contributed to this story.  </P></p>

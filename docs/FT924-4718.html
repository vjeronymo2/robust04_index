			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / Letter: A taxing anomaly ignored Sir, There has been much debate over the last few days over whether the Queen should be liable for income tax. By contrast there has been remarkably little debate about the minimal levels of taxation payable by European civil servants. The moves towards a single market in Europe make this increasingly anomalous. In addition this results in considerable distortions in the local housing and job markets in Brussels and in Luxembourg, where the difference in net salary levels between the private sector and the European institutions is considerable. Which is it: subsidiarity in practice or extreme parochialism on the part of the British public? Jonathan Miles, 315 Route de Longwy, L-2519 Luxembourg</p>

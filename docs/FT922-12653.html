			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / International Company News: Deere pulls out of accord with leading competitors DEERE &amp; CO, the troubled US construction equipment maker, has pulled out of the three-way alliance with Fiat of Italy and Hitachi Construction Machinery of Japan. The decision has thrown into doubt the future of the deal, which was seen as a response by three leading construction equipment makers to the crisis facing their recession-hit industry. The US group said the agreement signed in November last year to explore a joint venture stipulated that a final decision on the accord would be made after a period of evaluation and discussion. 'As a result of that evaluation, we decided that it was not in the interest of Deere &amp; Co to proceed,' the company said. Hitachi confirmed that it would continue discussions with Fiat but would not elaborate. Fiat, which may have the most to lose from the Deere move, said the two remaining partners, which already had a joint venture arrangement before the latest deal, had decided to press ahead. However, they are now likely to change substantially the nature of the agreement, possibly reducing its scope or even seeking an alternative partner. The Fiat-Hitachi-Deere link envisaged the creation of a new company to be majority-owned by Fiat. The new venture would use the Italian group's existing sales network in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Fiat would have contributed its earth-moving equipment business, which is partly covered by an existing joint venture with Hitachi, while Hitachi and Deere would have contributed product and manufacturing expertise to the new company. The arrangement was seen as advantageous for all sides as it would have helped to overcome the severe problems of over-capacity in the industry, which has already experienced considerable concentration in takeovers and co-operative ventures. It may even have paved the way for an eventual merger of the three companies' European construction equipment businesses. The reasons behind Deere's decision are not known. It is believed that Deere was unhappy with the distribution arrangements for the backloader that it was to have contributed to the venture.</p>

			<p><P> January 6, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GORBACHEV AND CHANGES IN EAST BLOC  </P> <P> Time magazine names Mikhail Gorbachev "Man of the Decade." Commentators in The  Times applaud him for his progressive policies, stating that his policies have  assisted the democratization of Eastern Europe (editorial, "Man of the Decade's  Challenge," Dec. 29).  </P> <P> Why not give credit where it's due?  </P> <P> For nine years, first Ronald Reagan and then George Bush have insisted that  America's military remain strong, and have assisted anti-communist rebels and  regimes worldwide, notably in Afghanistan, Africa and Latin America.  </P> <P> In trying to counteract this military pressure, Russia has bankrupted its  puppet dictatorships by forcing them to feed the Russian people and arm the  Russian military. Now that the Warsaw Pact economies are on the verge of  collapse, Gorbachev allows them to go democratic, hoping, no doubt, that when  the real crunch hits in February or March, it will be blamed on the new order,  and that repressive policies will be put back in the spring.  </P> <P> Liberals are calling for massive reductions in the U.S. defense budget now. I  suggest we postpone any cuts until free elections are allowed in Russia.  </P> <P> Gorbachev is a chess player. In chess, until the king is captured, it doesn't  matter how many pawns are sacrificed.  </P> <P> JEFF BRODY  </P> <P> Venice  </P></p>

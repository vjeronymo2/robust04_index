			<p>930607 FT  07 JUN 93 / International Company News: Hawtal Whiting losses at Pounds 2m LOSSES at Hawtal Whiting, which provides design and engineering services to the motor industry, continued to mount in the second six months and for the full 1992 year reached Pounds 2.18m pre-tax. The deficit, which compared with previous profits of Pounds 197,000, was struck after taking account of exceptional provisions amounting to Pounds 1.5m. Provision made against amounts owed by Leyland-Daf, which went into receivership in February, was Pounds 805,000. Balance of the overall provision was made up as to Pounds 333,000 for other identified doubtful debts and Pounds 365,000 for restructuring, including redundancies and facility rationalisations. Turnover for the year slipped to Pounds 56.4m (Pounds 62.4m). Pre-exceptionals, the group made an operating profit of Pounds 513,000 (Pounds 1.74m) after taking account of a first half loss of Pounds 368,000. Losses per share worked through at 39.6p (0.9p). The dividend for the year is being passed - last time a nominal 0.1p was paid. The directors said that a deterioration in shareholders' funds to Pounds 3.6m against Pounds 6.37m, brought about by poor trading conditions in 1992, together with the failure of Leyland-Daf, would result in the company breaching the existing borrowing powers laid down in its articles of association when the audited accounts for the year were published. Shareholders will be asked to consider a resolution to authorise a temporary increase in Hawtal's borrowing powers. The directors pointed out that the group was not in breach of any loan or facility covenants and continued to have the support of its banks. Net debt at year-end had risen to Pounds 14.1m (Pounds 10.22m).</p>

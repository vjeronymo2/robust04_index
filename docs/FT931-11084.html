			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / Leading Article: Cyprus choice GREEK CYPRIOTS have an important decision to make next Sunday, and the Sunday after, in their two-ballot presidential election. It is to all intents and purposes a referendum on the 'set of ideas' proposed by the United Nations as a basis for reuniting the island as a single state, but with two separate zones for Greeks and Turks and a federal constitution. The incumbent, Mr George Vassiliou, was intimately involved in negotiating this document and is firmly committed to it. Of his two serious opponents one, Mr Paschalis Paschalides, rejects it outright, while the other, Mr Glafcos Clerides, says it contains both good and bad, and claims that he can improve it. The latter claim is quite unrealistic. The set of ideas, although worked out by the UN Secretariat on the basis of two years of intensive contact with both sides, has been rejected by Mr Rauf Denktas, the Turkish Cypriot leader, as giving too much to the Greeks. But it has been formally endorsed by the UN Security Council which, in a resolution passed last November, pointed its finger clearly at the Turkish Cypriot side as being responsible for the failure of repeated attempts to reach agreement, and formally called on that side 'to adopt positions that are consistent with the set of ideas' on certain important issues. That the Security Council should have involved itself in this way in the substance of negotiations between the two communities, and have come down so clearly on one side, is unprecedented, and constitutes a remarkable victory for Mr Vassiliou's moderate and reasonable approach. Mr Denktas and his protectors on the Turkish mainland are more isolated internationally on the issue than at any time since Turkey used force to secure the northern third of the island for the Turkish-speaking fifth of the population in 1974-75. At that time the Turks successfully defied Security Council resolutions calling for the withdrawal of all foreign troops from the island; and in cold war conditions the council did nothing about it, except urge the two Cypriot communities to negotiate. In the 1990s it will not be so easily fobbed off. Turkey would have to take seriously the position of a re-elected President Vassiliou, backed by a sympathetic President Clinton and, for once, a united EC. Greek Cypriot voters would be foolish indeed if they spared the Turkish government that dilemma.</p>

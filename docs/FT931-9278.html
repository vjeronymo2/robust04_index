			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Oversold on Europe Kingfisher's flirtation with the French electrical chain Darty is reviving debate about the merits of overseas retail expansion. As Kingfisher must be anxiously aware, the precedents are scarcely propitious. In the 1980s, a wave of UK retailers tried to expand in the US by splashing out almost Dollars 9bn on acquisitions. With precious few exceptions, they have produced dismal returns. Dixons' unhappy experience with Silo is the latest entry in the encyclopaedia of woe. Pessimists fear that as UK retailers turn to mainland Europe they will simply throw their money away again. But there are significant differences between the two regions. The most obvious is that mainland Europe is closer, which makes control easier. While Marks and Spencer's North American business is based in New York, for example, it can oversee its more successful European operations from London. There are also scale advantages from operating across Europe as the single market becomes a reality. Kingfisher will doubtless stress such arguments. It will also help soothe operational doubts by pointing out that Darty's management will continue to run the business if the deal goes through. Darty is certainly a sound business in as stable a market as Europe can offer. Still, the safer route to international expansion lies through organic growth as the likes of Ikea, Toys R Us, and C&amp;A have successfully proved. This can take generations. Kingfisher wants quicker results. The price is higher risk.</p>

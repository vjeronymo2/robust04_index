			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Italy adds another dimension to debt The prolonged bull market in international bonds has generated many curious phenomena, not the least of them being yesterday's 2 trillion lire (Dollars 1.2bn) issue of 30-year Italian government bonds. Any rudimentary credit-scoring test of Italy would give poor results indeed. Existing commitments? More than 100 per cent of GDP - fail. Budget shortfall? Almost 10 per cent of GDP - fail. Stability of domestic arrangements? Only recently changed prime minister, tricky election coming up next spring, serious medium-term risk of national break-up - fail. Perhaps somebody, somewhere, believes that the Italian government, or its several successors, will repay the loan in the year 2023 with money that will then buy more than a cup of espresso coffee. Most do not, but then they do not seriously expect to be holding the bonds in 2023, only during the next few months. The point about ultra-long bonds is that they are volatile instruments which offer new opportunities to players in the financial markets. In a bull market investors have made money and have built the confidence to step up their level of risk. Given that the average length of the Italian government's debt is about three years, 30-year bonds introduce a new dimension for sophisticated speculators. Italian bonds have enjoyed a spectacular run. A year ago the 10-year government bond yield hit nearly 14 per cent, now it is down to 9.4 per cent. The total return so far in 1993 has been close to 30 per cent. Politically and economically the country has come back from the brink (but is still viewed suspiciously by the credit rating agencies). The short average maturity of the massive Dollars 1,000bn debt would normally be regarded as a disadvantage, but with interest rates tumbling it has actually proved a blessing in disguise. Through refinancing, the cost of servicing the debt is coming down fast, so that although the primary budget deficit is worsening, the overall deficit (including the enormous, but declining, amounts of debt interest) is improving. Why, therefore, start to lengthen the debt now? Logically because the scope for further falls in interest rates is seen as slight. Certainly, rates are low by past standards: curiously, Italy's 10-year bond yields have tumbled lower outside the European exchange rate mechanism than they were while the country was supposedly converging towards German-style inflation rates. Temporarily, inflation at 4 per cent is no higher than in Germany, but inflation as low as this makes the decision to issue 30-year debt at 9.87 per cent look very strange. The implied real interest rate is well over 5 per cent (albeit reduced for foreign investors who pay a 12 1/2 per cent withholding tax) and an overborrowed nation cannot travel down such a financial path for long: if the real interest rate is greater than the economic growth rate, arithmetic dictates that the burden of debt will go on increasing. Governments that truly believe in low inflation will never issue long-dated fixed interest bonds with high coupons. The British government has been more logical in this respect, having been reluctant to issue gilts in recent months with longer than a 15-year maturity. Inflation-linked bonds would be a more logical alternative for the Italians, but only if they could be issued on real yields of between 2 and 3 per cent. Of course, in the context of the formidable total of Italian government debt a mere Dollars 1.2bn (little more than a thousandth of the total) does not count for much: a billion here and a billion there does not, after all, add up to real money. Perhaps we should regard it as a marker or a status symbol, or just a minor instrument for the global bond desks to play with. The 30-year bond therefore looks like a diversion. Surely the real question is how the Italian national debt will eventually be restructured; the country's creditors should bear in mind the uncomfortable thought that by ceasing to pay interest the Italians would put their budget more or less back into balance (something that is far from true for the UK, for instance). We can be sure that there will be action long before 2023.</p>

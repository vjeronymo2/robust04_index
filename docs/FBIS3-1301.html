			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Willi Germund: "Brown Network From Germany to </F> South Africa"]    [Text] Johannesburg -- German and South African  authorities are investigating the possibility of an  international network by which German right-wing extremists are  taken to South Africa. Yesterday morning, German Horst Klentz  (57) was arrested, along with his accomplice, Alex Neidnelein,  in Boskop, close to the South African capital, Pretoria. Last  Monday, there was a gunfight with the South African police.    According to information obtained by DIE TAGESZEITUNG,  Klentz, who is wanted in Namibia for murder, belongs to the same  network of German right-wing extremists with whom the murderers  of South African communist leader Chris Hani, who was killed in  April 1993, were in contact. He wrote, among other things, for  the neofascist circular DIE AUSCHWITZLUEGE [The Lie About  Auschwitz] and used newspaper advertisements to recruit "young,  strong people." They were later trained in shooting and bombing  techniques on farms in South Africa. Helmut Hornung, who owns a  farm on the Sabie River near the city of Graskop in Transvaal,  also belongs to the Klentz group in South Africa. Hornung only  receives visitors who have been personally recommended by  National Democratic Party of Germany functionary Guenter Deckert  in Weinheim and Peter Dehoust, publisher of the magazine NATION  UND EUROPA in Coburg in Upper Franconia. According to Hornung,  the German right-wing extremists are still in training on farms  in South Africa.    NATION UND EUROPE publisher Dehous was in close contact with  South African journalist Arthur Kemp, who procured the addresses  of politicians who were to be murdered at the order of Hani's  murderers. At that time, Kemp was not arrested because he helped  the authorities with their investigations. Before that, he had  written articles for NATION UND EUROPA and held lectures before  right-wing extremists and the "German-South African Society" in  Coburg. Moreover, the Klentz group in South Africa maintains  contacts with German neo-Nazi Manfred Roeder, who was released  from prison early in 1990. He held lectures when he visited the  Cape in early 1993.    During a gunfight last Monday, Thomas Kuntz, who was wanted  for aggravated robbery in Germany, was killed. His accomplice  Stephan Rays was arrested. Some weeks ago, the two had been  watched in the circle of South African right-wing extremists  around the formerly illegal radio station, Radio Pretoria.</p>

The restructuring of the UN  Security Council and how it can become more effective were also  discussed at the talks. Cetin was also received by New Zealand  Prime Minister Jim Bolger. He also met with Donald Charles  McKinnon, New Zealand deputy prime minister and minister of  external relations and trade.    Later official talks were held between the two delegations  headed Cetin and McKinnon. The two ministers held a joint news  conference after the talks.

			<p><P> May 10, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> AVON STOCK SOARS ON AMWAY OFFER  </P> <P> Avon Products Inc. said today it received a $39-a-share takeover proposal from  Amway Corp., sending the stock price of the struggling door-to-door cosmetics  company soaring.  </P> <P> Amway, the home products company known for a zealous direct-sales force, said  last week that it had acquired a 10.3% stake in Avon with a partner,  Minneapolis investor Irwin Jacobs.  </P> <P> Avon -- a $3-billion company based in Ada, Mich., that has been hampered by a  heavy debt load and a trickling cash flow -- said the proposal for an  acquisition was made only by Amway.  </P> <P> Avon shares were up $3.125 to $39.125 in heavy mid-afternoon trading on the New  York Stock Exchange.  </P> <P> A spokesman for Avon said the company, which earlier this week filed lawsuits  seeking to block an unwanted takeover by Amway and Jacobs, had no immediate  comment.  </P></p>

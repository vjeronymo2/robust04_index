			<p><P> June 12, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VOTE NOTE;  </P> <P> PRIMARY BLUES  </P> <P> Does familiarity with democracy breed contempt?  </P> <P> In Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria -- oh so fresh and new to the democratic game --  people hit the polling booths over the weekend as if they were going to the  beach.  </P> <P> In Bulgaria, 84% of the 6.4 million eligible voted; the Czech figure reached  96% of 11.2 million.  </P> <P> Not here. Only 39% of the 19 million eligible bothered to vote last week in the  California primary. Why? One theory: Nowadays people vote less because they  think it does little good. In a way, non-voting is a kind of protest  non-movement.  </P> <P> Then there's another theory -- that fewer people vote these days because  America is working well enough and people are not all that agitated. Hmm... By  such logic, Californians must be profoundly satisfied with the way things are  going -- Tuesday's turnout was the lowest since 1960.  </P> <P> And then there's a theory that it's a good thing not everyone votes. With  Tuesday's ballot loaded down with propositions, only the well-informed could  not have been intimidated by the prospect of voting. So people who're aware of  what's going on voted, while those who didn't much care or don't know much  didn't. So why encourage ignorant voting by decrying low turnouts?  </P> <P> Sophistries aside, it's better when more people care, when more people are  informed, when more people vote. There were some good primary outcomes last  week but overall the low turnout is telling us something. And it's not good.  </P></p>

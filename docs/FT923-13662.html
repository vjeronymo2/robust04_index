			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Ferry row referred to police THE LEGAL wrangle over one of the oldest ferry routes in Europe took a new turn yesterday after the operators of the cross-Thames service announced that they had passed files to the police alleging that the Crown Estate could be open to prosecution if it forces closure of the service. The rights to the crossing are owned by the Crown Estate. It has told White Horse Ferries, operators of the Tilbury-Gravesend ferry service, to stop journeys on the route. The Crown Estate, which manages property owned by the sovereign, says the route licence held by the previous operator was non-transferable. The company has defied the order to halt services and is seeking damages for loss of revenue and a fall in passenger numbers. White Horse has now sent to the police details of legal judgments indicating that the commissioners acting for the Crown Estate may risk committing an offence if the service is closed. White Horse says it is an offence if a ferry owner breaches its common-law obligation to operate a service. Essex police confirmed yesterday that they had received the documents. Copies of the judgments have also been sent to the Crown Estate, which said it was seeking legal advice.</p>

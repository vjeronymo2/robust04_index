			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / International Company News: CRA bucks prices trend with advance to ADollars 379m CRA, the Australian mining company, has traded against the trend of falling commodity prices to increase net profit to ADollars 379.6m (USDollars 256.40m) from ADollars 128.1m for the first half of 1993. The result was achieved on a 12.2 per cent rise in sales to ADollars 2.79bn and allows CRA to double its dividend to 30 cents a share. Directors said the result was helped by a weaker Australian dollar and higher sales volumes for iron ore. These factors more than offset the negative impact of weaker prices for aluminium, iron ore, zinc, lead and coal. The biggest after-tax contribution came from iron ore, up at ADollars 191.0m from ADollars 161.0m, coal earnings jumped from ADollars 34.5m to ADollars 119.5m, boosted by the acquisition of Coal and Allied Industries, and profit on diamonds was ADollars 41.4m, up from ADollars 36.9m. Other significant earnings contributions came from copper/gold, up from ADollars 3m to ADollars 34.7m, and aluminium, improving from ADollars 12.1m to ADollars 27.8m. The overall result included some non-trading items, chiefly a ADollars 37.7m surplus on the superannuation fund (compared with a ADollars 55.4m deficit previously) and a ADollars 91.5m positive tax adjustment. Capital expenditure rose from ADollars 254.4m to ADollars 436.3m. Gross borrowings at the end of June totalled ADollars 1.44bn, against ADollars 1.2bn a year ago. Renison and Pasminco, the large Australian mining companies, report continuing losses for the June year following lower commodity prices and heavy asset write downs. Pasminco's net loss increased to ADollars 86.9m from ADollars 58.6m. Renison's net loss rose to ADollars 24.4m from ADollars 10.1m.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Pu Liye (5543 4539 2814)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 2 Jun (XINHUA) -- State Councillor Chen  Junsheng recently said emphatically: In economically developed  coastal provinces, agricultural development does not conflict  with the development of secondary and tertiary industries, and  agricultural development and industrial development are not  interchangeable. Those who think the development of secondary  and tertiary industries will eventually affect agricultural  development are wrong. He added: As long as cadres at all  levels earnestly take the overall interests into consideration,  they will be able to promote and develop primary, secondary, and  tertiary industries simultaneously. If they develop secondary  and tertiary industries at the expense of agriculture, the  consequences will be perilous.    The State Council held a joint conference on comprehensive  agricultural development in Beijing on 31 May. Leaders from  departments concerned of the CPC Central Committee exchanged  views on the arrangements for such comprehensive agricultural  development projects as the Liao He Small Delta development  project. Chen Junsheng pointed out at the meeting: We are  faced with a very important task -- under the situation in which  the population continues to grow and farmland shrinks with each  passing year, how can we take effective measures to utilize and  develop farmland resources to the maximum, ensure a long-term  and stable supply of agricultural produce, and pay attention to  family planning and control of illegal use of farmland at the  same time?    Chen Junsheng urged localities to do a good job in the  following aspects while developing and utilizing land resources:    First, we need to further transform medium- and low-yield  farmland and quicken the pace of rationally cultivating  wasteland. He said: From 1988 to 1993, 145 million mu of  medium- and low-yield farmland has been transformed, and 17.25  million mu of wasteland has been cultivated across the country.  These two projects helped increase 1.915 billion kg of grains,  a increase of 105 kg per mu. It is a great achievement. At  present, 855 million mu of medium- and low-yield farmland  nationwide has not yet been transformed, indicating great  potential in the increase of grain production. The key to  achieving the task lies in irrigation construction,  popularization of improved varieties of grains, and development  of new cultivation techniques. From now on, we should further  arouse the enthusiasm of all sides and intensify efforts in  cultivating wasteland. In this field, we must persist in paying  equal attention to economic, social, and ecological efficiency.    Second, we must turn the desert into an oasis. China now has  1 billion mu of usable sandy wasteland. If we spend 10 years  developing 100 million mu of sandy wasteland, we will get  incalculable social and ecological benefits. He said: China  has accumulated plenty of successful experiences in desert  control and we should popularize these experiences in various  localities in line with local conditions.    Third, we should develop coastal shoals and reclaim land  from  marshes. Chen Junsheng said: There is nearly 20 million mu of  shoals along China's coastal provinces that are suitable for  cultivation. If we can turn 10 million mu of these shoals into  farmland in 10 years, we will gain huge profits.    Chen Junsheng spoke highly of Liaoning's measures to promote  comprehensive agricultural development in recent years and its  achievement of being more than sufficient in agricultural  produce. Liaoning, China's base of heavy industries and raw  materials, had been short of grain and major nonstaple food for  a long time. Since 1988, Liaoning has made efforts in  comprehensive agricultural development and has significantly  increased grain production. Since 1990, total grain production  in Liaoning has reached 1.5 billion kg, enough for the entire  province. Since then, Liaoning has not needed to import grain  from other regions. Currently, Liaoning has a sufficient supply  of nonstaple food like poultry, eggs, milk, pork, and  vegetables. Chen Junsheng pointed out: Liaoning offers a good  example to other coastal provinces in coordinately developing  primary, secondary, and tertiary industries.</p>

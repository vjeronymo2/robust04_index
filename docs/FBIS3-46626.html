			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed "Seismometer" column article] </F>   [Text] Eight pro-coalition factions of the Social  Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] have recently united into a  policy group called "Democrats." It appears the new SDPJ  faction is getting ready for a breakaway from the party when  Chairman Tomiichi Murayama and the ideology-oriented factions  react negatively toward the enactment of the political reform  bills. In fact, the Democrats are steadily promoting  "exchanges" with the Japan New Party [JNP] and the Sakigake.  The weak point of the Democrats is the fact that they have no  prominent leader yet, but many members expect Hokkaido Governor  Takahiro Yokomichi to return to the Diet to lead them. If that  happens, the Democrats may trigger the second stage of political  regrouping, with some members actively seeking the foundation of  "a troika party led by three ex-governors -- Prime Minister  Hosokawa, Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura, and Mr. Yokomichi as  the leader of the Democrats."  <H5>  Forty Dietmen Gather at Founding Assembly </H5>   On 22 December, or the day following the launch of the  Democrats, SDPJ Diet Administration Committee Chairman Koken  Nosaka criticized Vice Chairman Churyo Morii in the Diet for  participating in the Democrats as a commissioner. Nosaka said:  "I do not think organizing a new, giant faction is a good idea.  Even in my faction there are members seeking to form new  groups, but I am stopping them from such reckless action."    Morii, however, did not take the complaint seriously, and  answered: "I agree with you. I just allowed them to use my  name. That was all I did."    Nosaka angrily said: "If you really agreed with me you would  have tried to stop them."    The founding assembly of the Democrats comprised 40 SDPJ  Diet  members from both the rightist and middle-of-the-road factions.  Members include former SDPJ Chairman Makoto Tanabe and former  Secretary General Hirotaka Akamatsu. While such interfactional  movements have never had any success so far in the SDPJ, the  foundation of the Democrats may represent the turning-point for  the party. In an address given to the founding assembly,  Secretary General Shogo Abe of the Social Democratic Federation  said emotionally: "I feel my party has now completed its  historical role." SDPJ Secretary General Wataru Kubo did not  address the assembly out of consideration for the position of  Chairman Tomiichi Murayama; however, the group adopted as its  main objective the "regrouping of political parties" rather than  the SDPJ rightists' conventional goal of "party reform."    The Democrats use their broadly-acceptable name to actively  seek ties with other parties. As the secretary general of the  Democrats, former Secretary General Akamatsu attended the first  meeting of a study group on "long-term and basic problems" on 22  December. It was jointly organized by the Democrats and some  JNP members. Akamatsu stressed that "closer ties between the  Democrats and the JNP will trigger a greater trend toward  political regrouping." The study group was organized by 26  members, with equal numbers from the JNP and the SDPJ. The SDPJ  members all belong to the Democrats. In its platform, the  Democrats declared policy is to seek "small central government  and big local government." This is also an objective of the  study group.    On the evening of the same day, Democrats Commissioner  Masanori Goto met with Representative Kenichiro Sato and other  Sakigake members. They discussed positively a "three-party  tie-up between the JNP, Sakigake, and the SDPJ."    Goto proposed: "The JNP, the Sakigake, and the SDPJ should  carry out a nationwide campaign tour next spring. It will have  a great impact on the public."  <H5>  Receiving Yokomichi as Deputy Prime Minister </H5>   On the evening of 21 December, SDPJ ideologists held a  meeting as if in competition with the Democrats. At the  meeting, SDPJ Chairman Murayama predicted: "The coalition  government may make further concessions to the Liberal  Democratic Party [LDP] on the political reform bills, and  further revise them to bring them more into line with the LDP  proposal. This means the coalition is deserting the SDPJ. In  mid-January, the SDPJ is likely to be faced with the ultimate  choice."    SDPJ ideologists will not accept drastic concessions on the  political reform bills, but Murayama is afraid the "Democrats  may support the coalition even against the wishes of the party  leadership." When Diet debates on the political reform bills  reach a climax in mid-January, the SDPJ will face a crucial  choice.    The Democrats group, meanwhile, is not yet fully active  because it "has a team flag but no captain." The faction is  currently led by nine commissioners selected from eight  pro-coalition factions. The lack of one prominent leader is the  reason the Democrats want Governor Yokomichi, who used to serve  as an SDPJ lower house member, as their leader alongside  Hosokawa and Takemura.    The Democrats, JNP members, and major union officials are  excited about the idea of getting Yokomichi back to the Diet.  Some of them say: "The Democrats, the JNP, Sakigake, LDP  reformists, and some Democratic Socialist Party members should  form a 100-man party now, before the next general election, to  start a new trend in Japanese politics. If that were to happen,  the party would become popular under its troika leadership of  Hosokawa, Takemura, and Yokomichi."    Yet others say: "If Mr. Yokomichi returns to the lower  house, we would prepare for him the post of deputy prime  minister." SDPJ Secretary General Kubo was an ally of Yokomichi  when they organized the New Trend Association [Atarashii  Nagare-no-kai]. An SDPJ cabinet member said: "At that time,  Mr. Kubo's dream was to serve as the party secretary general  under Chairman Yokomichi. I think he still has the dream."  <H5>  "Differences" in Attitudes of JNP Members </H5>   In mid-December, Governor Yokomichi visited Tokyo to make  petitions about the 1994 budget; however, he had positive  meetings with senior SDPJ officials and labor unions during his  stay. On 24 December, he held a news conference at the Hokkaido  Prefectural Government's Tokyo office, and announced "I am now  working on Hokkaido's fiscal 1994 budget, and I have to serve my  third term to the end."    However, when he met Shinseito officials Yokomichi  reportedly  said he might resign from the prefectural government after  enacting the fiscal 1994 budget.    He was quoted then as saying: "If the general election is  held in January, I cannot run in that. The governor's position  is different from that of an assemblyman because I have to  fulfill my responsibility to the public by enacting the 1994  budget for Hokkaido."    Governor Yokomichi is unlikely to take action if there is an  election in January. Members of the Democrats are irritated by  this, saying "contrary to our expectations he seems to be a man  of indecision."    At the JNP secretaries' meeting held on 22 December, Vice  Secretary General Seishu Makino called reported the foundation  of the long-term problem study group and called it a joint  JNP-SDPJ group.    Secretary Kodo Kohata reacted strongly to this, saying:  "What I want is not an explanation, but your apology." There  are many pro-Shinseito members in the JNP, and they do not  really welcome closer ties with the SDPJ Democrats. SDPJ  Democrats may have great expectations of political events next  year, but they still feel a sense of uncertainty.</p>

			<p><P> July 30, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MCDONALD'S PLANS GET COOL RECEPTION FROM EAST BERLIN  </P> <P> U.S. fast-food giant McDonald's unveiled plans today to open its first outlet  in East Germany but found its global hamburger empire was not to everyone's  taste.  </P> <P> Environmentalists and city politicians hostile to the move snuffed a planned  blaze of publicity, ensuring that not a single Big Mac made it across the  Berlin Wall to accompany the news.  </P> <P> "We are a successful restaurant chain offering quality products, not some  wandering snack bar," Walter Rettenwender, chairman of McDonald's Germany, said  at a news conference.  </P> <P> Not everyone agreed.  </P> <P> East Berlin's City Council refused permission for a mobile McDonald's burger  stand in the Alexanderplatz, saying it wanted to cut down on street traders in  its main square.  </P> <P> McDonald's canceled a five-star press reception in an East Berlin hotel,  fearing disruption from ecologists who say the company is bad for health and  the planet.  </P> <P> Even plans to hand out burgers at the news conference went wrong. Journalists  had smoked-salmon sandwiches instead.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, May 27 (XINHUA) -- The American Chamber  of Commerce in Hong Kong welcomes President Bill Clinton's  decision to renew China's most-favored nation (MFN) trade status  and delink human rights issues from the annual renewal of MFN.    "it is critically important to Asia -- the most dynamic and  vital region on the face of the globe -- that our two countries  have a relationship that works," the chamber said in a news  release issued here this evening.    It noted that the president's statement of his intention to  delink human rights issues from the annual renewal of MFN  signals a firm commitment on the part of the American Government  to rebuild a "functional, effective and wide-ranging bilateral  relationship."    "The long and bitter debate over MFN is over at last," said  Gerald Murdock, chairman of the chamber.    This is a time for "moderation and optimism," he said,  adding  "both the United States and China must seize the moment to build  new ties, based on broader engagement and dialog."</p>

			<p>CSO     [Text] The Mexican Center for Children's Rights has  reported that approximately a million children in the country  between ages eight and 17 are inhaling solvents, and that there  is no control over the sale of these products.    The foregoing is inferred from the study made by that  center,  titled "Inhalable Solvents and Child Drug Addiction," in which  it also specifies that these substances are used primarily by  street children. They are easily purchased in paint shops, or  from shopping centers and street vending stands located in areas  where those youngsters gather.    Thinner, resistol, glue, paints, and dyes, among other  items,  cost relatively little; hence, they have been called "cheap  drugs." The price of any of these products ready for inhaling,  and contained in bottles or plastic bags, is from five to 10 new  pesos.    Based on reports from previous years, this center claimed  that there is no effective control over the sale of these  products. It indicated that even some members of police forces  in Mexico City, and those in other countries, are profiting from  this criminal business.    It comments: "In legal terms, inhalable solvents are not  classified as drugs in Mexico, because they are industrial  products manufactured, transported, and sold lawfully." Hence,  the Penal Code does not categorize their sale for purposes other  than those for which they were manufactured as a crime.    As for the damage caused by the inhalable substances, the  report notes that it is known that recent studies with rats at  the Mexican Institute of Pediatrics determined that toluene, a  substance contained in all the products inhaled by children,  damages the brain chemistry, reducing the response time in  dangerous situations.</p>

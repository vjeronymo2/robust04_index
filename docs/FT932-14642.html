			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / Money Markets: UK futures tumble THERE was a sharp change of mood in both the sterling cash and futures markets yesterday, with dealers taking the view that UK base rates could soon be on an upward trend, writes James Blitz. On the futures market, there was a substantial sell-off in the June and Septmber sterling contracts following the announcement that the headline figure for inflation in March had risen to 1.9 per cent from 1.8 per cent year-on-year. The unexpected rise in the data raised speculation that the UK authorities might have to tighten monetary policy if inflation were to remain within the government's target range. The data also came at the end of a week which has seen a raft of indicators suggesting that the UK economy is in the midst of an unswing, and that another cut in base rates might not be needed. Compounding the change of mood was the Bank of England's announcement yesterday that it will set another gilt auction on April 28. This may mean there is a drain on liquidity at the end of the month, bringing tighter money market conditions and rates. All these factors created a strong view in the market that 6 per cent may mark the bottom for UK rates in this cycle. Last night, there was a clear upward sloping yield curve in both the cash and futures markets for the first time this year. The strongest reaction to the RPI data came in the futures market, where the June contract fell 14 basis points to bottom out at 93.92. It later closed at 93.94, pricing 3-month money in June at 6.04 per cent. There was an even stronger reaction in the March 1994 contract, which lost 44 basis points on the day to close at 93.60. Cash rates firmed sharply in the wake of the figures with 3-month money closing up more than  1/16 per cent at 6 1/16 per cent. One year money moved up even more sharply at 6 3/16 per cent from a previous 5 7/8 per cent. Despite the stark change of mood, some dealers expressed the view that the market had heavily over-reacted. One dealer pointed to more UK economic data due out next week, including unemployment figures and retail sales figures for March. 'The market will retrace this latest move if these point out any sluggishness in the UK economy,' he said.</p>

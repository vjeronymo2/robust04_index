Mr Toboti said in a statement to SAPA  his comments on Radio Transkei earlier on Tuesday were in Xhosa  and had not been properly translated in subsequent reports.  "What I said was people who suspend members of the organisation  on false premises are causing chaos and division in the party."    Mr Toboti said he still had not been told of his suspension.  Earlier, Jaki Seroke of the PAC's publicity and information  office told SAPA they were having difficulty contacting Mr  Toboti to tell him of his suspension.    On Saturday the PAC announced the suspension of Mr Toboti,  Central Transkei Regional Secretary Mfanelo Skwatsha and Azanian  National Youth Unity member Chargin Mabaso with immediate effect  for criticising the PAC's suspension of its armed struggle.    Mr Seroke added the PAC had no interest in getting involved  in a "slanging match" with Mr Toboti. A decision had been  taken, he said.</p>

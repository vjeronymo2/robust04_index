			<p><P> July 13, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BUSH'S RAINSTORM GESTURE OF CHIVALRY COSTS AGENT A COAT  </P> <P> Remember the raincoat that President Bush so generously took off and gave to an  elderly woman in a rainstorm in Budapest, Hungary? Well, it wasn't his.  </P> <P> Barbara Bush said today that the raincoat belonged to a Secret Service agent  who was accompanying the President to an arrival ceremony in a downtown square  Tuesday.  </P> <P> After making an abbreviated speech, Bush spotted the woman in the crowd,  drenched to the bone after a heavy downpour. He took off the raincoat and gave  it to her -- a seemingly selfless gesture that attracted a lot of publicity.  </P> <P> Promising to replace the agent's coat, Barbara Bush said she and the President  know the exact brand they have to get.  </P></p>

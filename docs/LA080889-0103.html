			<p><P> August 8, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ARSON AT BUDDHIST HOUSE WAS HATE CRIME, REPORT SAYS  </P> <P> The July 3 firebombing of a Northridge home where Buddhist services were held  was a "hate crime" motivated by religious or racial prejudice, a report  presented Monday to the Los Angeles County Human Relations Commission  concluded.  </P> <P> Pradit and Pachri Phongpharnich and their two children escaped unharmed after  three firebombs were thrown at their house on Yolanda Avenue, authorities said.  The roof was badly damaged. No suspects have been identified.  </P> <P> The staff report, requested by the commission, ruled out the possibility that  the bombing was part of a neighborhood feud, said Eugene Mornell, the  commission's executive director. The neighbors generally were supportive,  Mornell said.  </P> <P> He said the arson may have been related to the firebombing of a synagogue in  Tujunga the same morning and the visit to Los Angeles of the Dalai Lama, the  exiled Tibetan leader revered by Buddhists, in early July.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Police Department has not concluded its investigation.  </P></p>

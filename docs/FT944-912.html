			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / Syria in 'secret' talks with Israel Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin's top military advisers have left for secret talks with Syrian officials in Washington, Israeli and Syrian media reported yesterday. Foreign minister Shimon Peres suggested closed-door talks were planned with Syria but refused to elaborate. 'Considering that these are secret negotiations, you cannot expect me to give all the details,' he said. Syria officially announced that a meeting between the Syrian and Israeli ambassadors to the US was due to be held in Washington yesterday. The official Syrian news agency Sana said Syrian and Israeli military officials would attend the talks due to be held at the State Department under the auspices and participation of the US. Channel Two TV said LtGen Ehud Barak, the Israeli military chief of staff, was in Washington for the talks. The army refused to comment. The peace talks appear still stuck over the Golan Heights captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed in 1981. Syria wants Israel to agree to a full withdrawal before discussing the terms of peace, while Israel is proposing a limited withdrawal followed by a testing period during which the final withdrawal line would be negotiated.</p>

			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / International Company News: Seafood price rise helps lift Irvin and Johnson A rise in international seafood prices and improved domestic retail sales helped Irvin and Johnson, the South African food processing company, to increase after-tax income 9 per cent to R62.2m (Dollars 13.7m) from R57.08m for the year ending in June. In spite of a 7 per cent fall in sales volumes, due largely to a decline in chicken supplies and a planned reduction in low-value seafood production, turnover rose 8 per cent to R1.77bn from R1.65bn. Operating income increased only 5 per cent to R88.26m from R84.19m, but a 14 per cent drop in tax paid, to R15.9m from R18.6m, helped improve overall results. The dividend was unchanged at 83 cents. The company said it was pressing ahead with an accelerated capital investment project to improve overall international competitiveness, noting that new capital expenditure for the year to June was R77.76m and that a further R35.2m had already been authorised. I&amp;J also announced it had reduced its shareholding in Namibia-based Kuiseb fish products through an issue of new shares to Namibian partners, leaving it with a 49 per cent interest in Kuiseb.</p>

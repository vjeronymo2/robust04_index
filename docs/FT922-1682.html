			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / WEU to be given military units for peacekeeping role FOREIGN and defence ministers from nine European countries agreed in Bonn yesterday to give the dormant Western European Union defence organisation a genuine military capability to enable it to take part in international peacekeeping and peacemaking operations. But it was clear that member states continue to disagree on the precise circumstances in which their troops would be made available. Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, with the Yugoslav conflict clearly in mind, emphasised that if peacemaking meant that member states would be prepared to impose a political solution by force, he believed that was excluded 'both in practice and in theory'. The Germans and French, however, were much more prepared to envisage a peacemaking role for WEU forces, though Mr Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign minister, conceded that Germany would not be 'in the forefront' of those advocating such a role because of its constitutional restrictions on employing German troops abroad. What was made clear in the so-called 'Petersburg Declaration,' named after the mansion on the outskirts of Bonn where the conference was held, was that the WEU would take part in peacekeeping, and humanitarian operations only at the request of other international organisations such as the United Nations and the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE). Every decision to answer such requests would be taken on a case-by-case basis and individual member countries would reserve their sovereign right to participate or not. Though the ministers, who hailed their declaration as an important step towards forging a European defence identity, said they were ready to make available to the WEU military units 'from the whole spectrum of their conventional armed forces', no final decision was taken on precisely which units would be assigned to the organisation. However, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the British defence secretary, said there had been wide support for his proposal that multinational units such as the planned Dutch-Belgian-German-British Nato rapid reaction force and the UK-Netherlands amphibious force should also be put at the disposal of the WEU under so-called 'double hatting' arrangements. Though France and Germany are also prepared to make available to WEU their proposed joint 'Eurocorps', Mr Rifkind indicated that Britain and some other member countries had expressed 'ongoing concerns' about the confusion that would arise from the fact that German troops came under Nato command, while French forces were outside the Nato command structure. In a special declaration on Yugoslavia, the ministers said the WEU was prepared, 'within the bounds of its possibilities', to contribute towards the effective implementation of UN Security Council resolutions on the application of sanctions against Serbia.</p>

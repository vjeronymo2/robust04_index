			<p><P> July 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TEST RESULTS  </P> <P> Because of John Matuszak's prominence, tests were done as quickly as possible  (June 19). Hmm . . . it's a shame he wasn't a little less prominent, so as to  get lost in the shuffle as my girlfriend did. (It took nine weeks for the  results.)  </P> <P> To Lilia Shelton, coroner's supervising investigator: How about dealing from  the top of the deck?  </P> <P> TOM NOVIKOFF  </P> <P> Santa Fe Springs  </P></p>

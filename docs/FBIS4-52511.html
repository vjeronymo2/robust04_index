			<p>BFN     [Text] Kobe, May 10 KYODO -- A government panel studying  agricultural policies on Tuesday [10 May] received calls for a  review of the controversial Food Control Law which regulates  rice production and distribution, Farm Ministry officials said.    The Agricultural Administration Council, an advisory panel  to  the prime minister, held a closed-door session here Tuesday to  hear views from 11 representatives of agricultural, distribution  and consumer groups in western Japan, the officials said. Most  attendants called for the government to make efforts toward  self-sufficiency in rice production and stable supplies, while  seeking a review of the Food Control Law, taking a flexible  approach to rice production and sales, the officials said.    They said the representatives of agricultural cooperatives  and consumer organizations urged the government to ease  regulations on rice production and distribution.    The council plans to hold similar sessions in six other  cities, including Sapporo and Miyazaki, before working out an  interim report for the government in July.</p>

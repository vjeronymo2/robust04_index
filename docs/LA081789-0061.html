			<p><P> August 17, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ELECTORATE TO DECIDE WHETHER TO ESTABLISH POLICE REVIEW PANEL  </P> <P> Voters next spring will decide whether to establish a citizen commission that  would for the first time give the public the power to investigate complaints of  police brutality and abuse.  </P> <P> The City Council this week voted 5 to 3 to place the proposal for a Citizen  Police Complaint Commission on next April's ballot, capping more than six  months of effort by a coalition of activists.  </P> <P> Despite the split council vote, supporters predicted that the commission would  win widespread popular support. "I think the community will be a completely  different story," said Frank Berry of the National Assn. for the Advancement of  Colored People, one of a number of organizations backing the commission  proposal.  </P> <P> Proponents said they will soon meet to plan a campaign to win approval of the  commission, which requires a change in the City Charter.  </P> <P> Although the 11-member review board, appointed by the mayor and the council,  would have the authority to investigate complaints, the city administration  would retain key powers. The city manager rather than the commission would  appoint the commission's independent investigator, and it would be up to the  police chief rather than the commission to actually discipline police officers.  </P> <P> The proposal also contains a provision directing the City Council to evaluate  the commission after it has been in existence for two years.  </P> <P> The idea of giving residents a say in misconduct investigations has been  discussed for years in Long Beach. But it was not until a white Long Beach  police officer was secretly videotaped in an encounter with a black police  activist last January that the proposal picked up sufficient political backing  to move forward.  </P> <P> On that tape, filmed by a TV crew and broadcast on national television, Officer  Mark Dickey appeared to shove activist Don Jackson into a plate-glass window  after pulling Jackson's car over for a routine traffic stop. Jackson, a former  Hawthorne police officer, had gone to Long Beach with the film crew to try to  prove longstanding allegations of police mistreatment of minorities in the  city.  </P> <P> Dickey and his partner have since gone on stress-related leave and are awaiting  trial on misdemeanor criminal charges stemming from the episode.  </P> <P> Barbara Shoag, who as a member of the city's Public Safety Advisory Commission  has crusaded for a review board, said that without the Jackson incident, the  commission proposal never would have gotten a place on the ballot.  </P> <P> Council proponents of the commission idea argue that it is necessary to restore  trust in the Police Department, while opponents contend that it robs the  council and the police administration of accountability.  </P> <P> The police administration earlier indicated it would prefer not to have a  citizen review board, but Assistant Chief Gene Brizzolara said the department  will not oppose the ballot item. "If the citizens feel that it is warranted,  they should go forward and vote in a police commission," he said.  </P> <P> Leaders of Long Beach's powerful police union have in the past said they will  support a citizen commission, but they have not appeared at any council  meetings to reaffirm their position.  </P> <P> Councilmen Clarence Smith, Evan Anderson Braude, Ray Grabinski, Tom Clark and  Wallace Edgerton voted to place the matter on the ballot. Council members Jan  Hall, Les Robbins and Jeffrey A. Kellogg voted no. Although Councilman Warren  Harwood attended Tuesday's council meeting, he was absent for the vote,  prompting criticism from the commission's supporters.  </P> <P> "He avoided the vote. It was very obvious," asserted Sid Solomon of Long Beach  Area Citizens Involved, a citywide political group.  </P> <P> Harwood later said his absence was unintentional, explaining that he had to  leave to make some telephone calls on council business. He added that his  absence "in no way represented any kind of opinion. I voted for this all the  way through."  </P></p>

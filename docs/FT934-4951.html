			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / International Company News: Synergies and savings elusive for Qantas - Upheaval has been the most conspicuous feature at the airline since its takeover of Australian 14 months ago Has Qantas, Australia's long-time international airline and, for the past 14 months, owner of the large internal Australian Airlines network, just passed through a bout of severe turbulence? Or are there more bumps ahead? For most of the year, upheaval has been the most conspicuous feature at the Sydney-based carrier. On the management front, Mr Gary Toomey today takes over as chief financial officer. He replaces Mr Graham Jones, who resigned recently after only 11 months with Qantas and who, according to industry sources, could not commit himself to a three-to-five year stint at the airline. Mr Jones followed in the footsteps of Mr John Ward, former managing director who departed in August, and Mr Bill Dix, previous Qantas chairman who resigned in March. Even with Mr Toomey's appointment as a director there is still a vacancy on the Qantas board. Finances have been equally tumultuous - Qantas recently announced a ADollars 377.2m (USDollars 249m) after-tax loss for the year to end-June. The deficit was due to large abnormal provisions, but operating profits still fell to just ADollars 32.9m, on revenues of ADollars 5.8bn. The result, which included a 10-month contribution of ADollars 9.5m from Australian Airlines, compared with revenues of ADollars 4.0bn and operating profit of ADollars 102.8m for Qantas alone in the previous year. All this can hardly be music to the ears of British Airways, which paid ADollars 665m for a 25 per cent stake in Qantas in March. Indeed, there has been speculation that the UK carrier, which is entitled to three of the 12 board seats at Qantas, instigated some of the top-level management changes. BA says only that it was consulted over Mr Dix's replacement, and declines to comment on Mr Jones' departure. Much of the turmoil relates directly to the Australian/Qantas tie-up. Airline mergers are notoriously difficult, and nobody pretends that this deal has been any exception. Take the labour situation, for example. Some 18 unions were represented at the two carriers, and although many were common to both - pilots being an exception - pay and conditions differed. Union negotiators say that wage rates tended to be higher at Qantas, while benefits and conditions were more generous at Australian. Qantas had one superannuation fund; Australian had seven. 'Extremely difficult' is how one labour representative leader characterises the efforts to move towards an integrated structure. The task, he adds, is probably about 70 per cent complete. The complexities are also demonstrated by the types of aircraft deployed. Qantas, as an international carrier, used Boeing 747s and 767s; Australian, 737s, 727s and Airbus A300s. There were obvious gains to be achieved from using some Qantas aircraft on internal routes, rather than have them sitting on the ground between international flights. But that, in turn, meant different servicing requirements at different airports. Conversely, when an Australian aircraft, repainted in Qantas colours, arrived in Melbourne, a demarcation dispute erupted over who should handle it. While fleet realignment has led to spare aircraft, Qantas - facing a weak equipment market - has yet to discard unwanted goods. 'We've still got four Australian A300s flying around,' says Mr Rodger Robertson, head of corporate planning. 'Four of any aircraft is a fleet size which is just too small. We're scheduling them out over the next 12 months, but the market for selling aircraft is not great.' Costs attached to these kinds of operational changes - together with the funding of around 1,835 redundances out of the pre-merger combined workforce of 27,000 - accounted for a large part of last year's abnormal charge. Qantas wrote off ADollars 282.3m of goodwill in respect of Australian; took a ADollars 71.5m pre-tax charge for redundancy and restructuring costs; revised aircraft depreciation policies, leading to a ADollars 46m charge before tax; and provided, to the tune of almost ADollars 40m, for the under-recovery of rentals on unused premises. But the pressing question is when the benefits from this process will show through, how substantial they will be, and whether other changes in the Australian aviation market will mitigate against a speedy upturn in Qantas' fortunes. All along, Qantas has argued that the eventual cost-savings from combining the airlines should run to at least ADollars 100m a year. 'I think we're relaxed with the Dollars 100m figure,' says Mr Robertson. However, he also admits that 'some of that will take some time to get in.' Some 'synergies', Mr Robertson suggests, will only be achievable over the very long-term. Anyone connecting from a old Qantas terminal to a former Australian one, for example, usually finds that they are on opposite sides of the airport. 'That means it's going to be a lifetime before we can do all the things an airline should do and get all its operations together'. How quickly the two airlines' 'cultures' will blend is also debatable. It is no secret that there were tensions between the two employee groups, at least at the outset. 'Qantas was bigger and it has always had a bit of a superiority complex,' says one observer. To make matters worse, Australian was headquartered in Melbourne and Qantas in Sydney. Rivalry between the two cities is legendary, and Australian employees faced the prospect of either shifting base or remaining in a 'branch office'. However, the appointment of executives with experience of Australian to top positions at the combined airline seems to have smoothed a few feathers. Mr James Strong, who took over as managing director from Mr Ward, was chief executive of Australian for four years in the 1980s; Mr Gary Pemberton, the new chairman, was an Australian director from 1988 to 1990. And Mr Toomey joins the Qantas fold from Arnotts, the food group, having been chief financial executive at Australian between 1987 and 1992. All the merger-related upheavals, meanwhile, come against the background of a local market which is still depressed and price-sensitive, and an international arena where Qantas must compete for routes with Ansett, the second and slightly larger domestic carrier. Just as Qantas was allowed to move into domestic aviation by merging with Australian, Ansett has been permitted to apply for international route authorities. It has already built up a clutch of interests in the Asia-Pacific basin. Qantas admits that watching the competition absorbs management effort, although it downplays the real impact. 'Ansett is more of an impediment than a huge competitor. They've got very good distribution in Australia, so they'll get Australians going on the service overseas, but they'll find it much more difficult to get into the in-bound market,' is the airline's own assessment. But the rivalry is clearly taken seriously: talking about trans-Tasman routes, for example, Qantas has made it clear that if Ansett is to be allowed to fly between domestic terminals in New Zealand and Australia, it wants parity. Finally, there is the question of British Airways' global ambitions, and the issue of how quickly and smoothly links with the UK carrier - and with USAir, BA's US partner - will be pursued. Here, any notion of swift integration is dismissed, a contrast to the 'seamless service' hype. 'So far we've achieved a lot of small things, but nothing monumental.' says Mr Robertson. 'I think BA has been concentrating much more on the USAir relationship and would have prefered the timing to be a little bit different,' he adds. 'Our approach has been a lot less structured than at USAir. There, they've got people appointed to handle the integration, and they've got consultants. There's none of that with Qantas, although there is a series of working groups talking on particular specialist issues. Some are making progress, others not so fast.' Some tripartite talks have been held, but Qantas remains cautious about the US leg of the alliance. Qantas customers who arrive on the west coast of the US, it points out, usually want to connect with flights to other big US cities such as Chicago or Washington, not to be ferried around USAir's east coast heartland. 'Our difficulty with USAir is that it doesn't serve the west coast of the US very much, and would not be Qantas' natural partner in the US. It just doesn't fit properly, which is why we still have our relationship with American Airlines over there. (Qantas, for example, shares a frequent-flier mileage scheme with American Airlines, BA's arch-rival on transatlantic routes.) Until, and if, USAir gets an operation which suits us, we'll stay that way.' At the end of the day, the delayed privatisation of the remaining 75 per cent of Qantas which is still owned by government means that the carrier probably has another year to get its house in order. Every moment, one suspects, will be welcome.</p>

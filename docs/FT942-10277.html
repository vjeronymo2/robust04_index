			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Schroders poised to launch Japanese investment trust Schroders is to launch an investment trust to catch the current wave of enthusiasm for Japan. The Schroder Japan Growth Fund will invest in the whole range of Japanese companies, from the Tokyo Stock Exchange first section to the over-the-counter market. It is the second new Japanese trust to be launched this year, while at least two existing funds have raised new capital or are planning to do so. Many trusts in the sector have been trading at a slight premium to net asset value, making new issues comparatively attractive. Schroder Investment Management is better known for unit than investment trusts: it already has four Japanese unit trusts. The new trust will be managed from Tokyo by Mr Ed Merner, who has been responsible for the Schroder Japanese Smaller Companies unit trust since its launch 10 years ago. Mr Jeremy Hill, a director of Schroder Investment Management, said the company believed there was growing evidence of recovery in Japan. The fund is being launched by means of a placing and public offer for subscription which opens on June 7 and closes on June 30. Shares will be issued at 100p, with warrants attached on a 1-for-5 basis. Dealings are due to start on July 11.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Kampala, 11 Apr (AFP) -- A Rwandan Patriotic Front  (RPF) spokeswoman in Uganda on Monday [11 April] refuted claims  by a Rwandan pro-Hutu extremist group that its chairman and  military commander had been killed. "The rumour is a work of  the CDR [Coalition for the Defence of the Republic] just to give  morale to the Rwandan Army...It is totally untrue, it is just a  work of a clique of people in Kigali who may be trying to  disorganise our camp, Christine Umutoni, a member of the  Political Bureau of the RPF, told AFP.    The radio of the Coalition for the Defence of the Republic  (CDR), a pro-Hutu extremist movement fiercely opposed to the  incorporation of the mainly Tutsi RPF in the Rwandan Government,  had earlier Monday reported that RPF commander Paul Kagame and  Chairman Alexis Kanyarengwe had been killed in a power struggle  within the movement.    Umutoni said she had contacted the RPF High Command in  Rwanda  at 8.00 A.M (5.00 GMT) on Monday morning and was informed that  rebel forces were advancing towards the Rwandan capital and were  now at Kabuye, eight kilometers (five miles) from Kigali. She  could not tell when they will storm the capital where ethnic  warfare continues to rage since the death of the Rwandan  President Juvenal Habyarimana and his Burundian counterpart in a  suspect plane crash on Wednesday. "We have not encountered any  significant resistance on the battle front," Umutoni said.</p>

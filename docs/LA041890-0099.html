			<p><P> April 18, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MAGNITUDE 4.6 AFTERSHOCK JOLTS SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA  </P> <P> A magnitude 4.6 earthquake that struck just west of Upland at 3:32 p.m. Tuesday  was the most recent of hundreds of aftershocks that have startled Southern  Californians after the Feb. 28 Upland earthquake.  </P> <P> The afternoon jolt was preceded by two foreshocks Tuesday, a magnitude 3.3  temblor at 7:12 a.m. and a magnitude 2.6 at 7:19 a.m.  </P> <P> Those, in turn, had been preceded by a magnitude 3.4 shock about three miles  farther northwest at 1:47 a.m. Tuesday.  </P> <P> Geologist Lucile Jones of the U.S. Geological Survey in Pasadena said the  number of aftershocks from the 5.5-magnitude Feb. 28 earthquake was "in the  normal range, but higher than average."  </P> <P> The greater-than-average aftershock activity in the Upland area does not  necessarily indicate that Tuesday afternoon's quake is the precursor of a  larger quake, Jones said. In California, she noted, there is a one-in-20 chance  that any earthquake is the foreshock of a larger shock, and that probability  holds for this one as well.  </P> <P> Although the afternoon shock startled residents of Upland and Pomona, which  suffered the most damage in the Feb. 28 earthquake, there were no reports of  significant damage or injuries. Officials surveyed buildings for damage, but  none was found except for a few bricks that tumbled from a chimney in the  city's "old district," Pomona Fire Inspector Ron Gomez said. "There wasn't any  damage other than nerves," he said.  </P> <P> Upland Assistant City Manager Mike Matlock said he was sitting at his desk in  City Hall when the 4.6 aftershock hit.  </P> <P> "It was strange," he said. "The floor felt like it sank three inches and came  back up. It was a hard jolt but not a very long one."  </P> <P> On Upland's Main Street, anxious shopkeepers and customers ran out of  storefronts.  </P> <P> The 4.6 quake was also felt from Brea to Huntington Beach, but Orange County  emergency officials said there were no reports of any significant damage. The  temblor was felt most strongly in North County, where police agencies in  Fullerton, Brea and La Habra reported dozens of calls from concerned residents.  </P> <P> "It was a strong roll, but we've had so many lately, nobody seemed to panic,"  said Sally Williams, a shopper in a Placentia supermarket. "A few boxes of  laundry soap fell off the shelf. Nothing serious."  </P></p>

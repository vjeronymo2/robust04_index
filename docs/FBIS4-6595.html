			<p>BFN     [Text] The military leadership today denied involvement  in a plot to liquidate Jose Ma. Sison, exiled leader of the  Communist Party of the Philippines-New People's Army-National  Democratic Front [CPP-NPA-NDF]. This was revealed by Lieutenant  General Arturo Enrile, Armed Forces of the Philippines [AFP]  chief of staff, and Maj. Gen. Alfredo Filler, AFP vice chief of  staff, in reaction to Sison's accusation.    Enrile emphasized that any attempt on the life of any of the  communist movement's leaders will only destroy the peace process  pushed by government.    Meanwhile, Filler said that there is no report of any such  plan monitored by the AFP Intelligence Service. Filler  clarified that it is Sison's group who are doing things that are  destructive to them in the first place, like murder, kidnapping,  and robbery.    [Begin recording in English] [Enrile] Why should we do that  in the first place. You know, we are part of that sincere  effort for peace in this country. If that is done, that will  only derail whatever peace process that we are working out with  the CPP-NPA-NDF. So, there is really no such thing.    [Filler] The Armed Forces of the Philippines do not operate  that way. We view such an act as entirely counterproductive to  the reconciliation process and our search for lasting peace.

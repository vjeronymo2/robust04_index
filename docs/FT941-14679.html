			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Bradstock buys Yarrow Young for up to Pounds 4.2m Bradstock Group, the insurance broker, is paying up to Pounds 4.2m for Yarrow Young, a general commercial insurance broker and financial adviser. The consideration is made up of an initial Pounds 3.5m cash and a further profit-related Pounds 700,000. Part of the initial payment will be satisfied by a vendor placing of 2.1m shares at 149p each to raise about Pounds 3.1m, before expenses. Bradstock is raising a further Pounds 3m by a placing of 2m shares, again at 149p. A large part of the proceeds will be used for repayment of Yarrow Young's debt. Both placings have been underwritten. Bradstock shares closed 3p lower at 153p. In total, shares to be issued will amount to about 7.5 per cent of Bradstock's existing share capital. It is expected that the effect of the acquisition and placings on earnings per share in the year to September 30 1994 will be broadly neutral. In the year to May 31 1993 Yarrow Young reported turnover of Pounds 2.6m (Pounds 2.5m) for pre-tax profit of Pounds 176,000 (Pounds 61,000). Net liabilities at the end of the period were Pounds 1.9m.</p>

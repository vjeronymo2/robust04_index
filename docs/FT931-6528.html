			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / Opposition mounts to widening Brussels' merger role FRANCE, Germany and the UK have joined forces to oppose any expansion of the European Commission's powers to vet large mergers when EC rules come up for review this autumn. The governments in Bonn, Paris and London have indicated to Brussels that they will resist moves to lower the turnover thresholds above which the EC's competition authorities automatically investigate deals affecting the EC market. Brussels officials last week said the Commission remained 'neutral' on the matter of thresholds. At present, Brussels looks at all mergers involving companies with a combined turnover of Ecus5bn (Pounds 6.1bn). Last December, Sir Leon Brittan, then EC competition commissioner, said existing thresholds were too high. Mr Karel van Miert, his successor, has yet to comment. But if he does propose lower thresholds, he will face strong opposition from France, Germany and the UK which see the matter as a test case for 'subsidiarity' - the principle that powers should be devolved to the most appropriate national or regional authority. Mr Michel Sapin, French finance minister, has suggested scaling back the Commission's competition powers, starting with higher thresholds for merger investigations. Paris was incensed in 1991 when the Commission blocked a Franco-Italian takeover of de Havilland, the Canadian aircraft-maker - the only merger so far rejected under the 1990 EC merger rules. Sir Bryan Carsberg, the director-general of the Office of Fair Trading in London, is reported to view an increase in Brussels' jurisdiction as premature. Similarly, the Bundeskartellamt in Berlin believes that, after only two years of operating the new rules, it is too soon to make a judgment on change. A senior Bundeskartellamt official suggested that Germany was pushing first for other reforms, specifically more open decision-making in Brussels. The Commission is conducting a wide-ranging review of its September 1990 merger rules. Consultations with industry, lawyers and governments are likely to be wrapped up in a fortnight, at which point the Commission must decide whether to push for more powers. Mr Van Miert must table any amendments by the end of the year for approval by member states. The EC's merger task force, the special unit set up within the Commission competition directorate, has won praise for its speed and comparative efficiency in examining more than 300 cases over the past two and a half years. The Commission is also examining whether to bring all joint ventures under the merger rules, and whether to allow companies to amend their deals to win approval during the preliminary inquiry.</p>

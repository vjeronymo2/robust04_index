			<p>921230 FT  30 DEC 92 / Vote forces Panic into opposition THE YUGOSLAV parliament yesterday passed a motion of no confidence in Mr Milan Panic, the moderate federal prime minister, thwarting the challenge of the Serbian-American millionaire to the country's most powerful political figure, Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic. The parliament voted to allow Mr Radoje Kontic, a deputy prime minister, to lead the caretaker government. Mr Panic said he will remain in Yugoslavia to lead opposition to the new government. Both houses of parliament voted overwhelmingly for the motion introduced by the extreme nationalist Serbian Radical party. The result was in contrast to a vote in November when delegates to the upper house from the republic of Montenegro, who enjoy parity with delegates from Serbia, saved Mr Panic's premiership by defeating a similar motion. The Radicals' leader, Mr Vojislav Seselj, named as a suspected war criminal by foreign governments and human-rights watchdogs, had called for Mr Panic to be barred from leading a caretaker government which would rule until the newly elected parliament is seated in early 1993. In last week's fraud-marred elections, Mr Milosevic heavily defeated Mr Panic. Yesterday the US State Department said elections in Serbia and its ally Montenegro 'failed to meet international standards for a free and fair democratic process.' It said Mr Milosevic's ruling party abused its position. Voter lists were manipulated so many eligible voters were excluded from voting, ballot boxes were not handled properly and voters were said to have been intimidated. Reuter adds from Sarajevo: Some 10,000 Moslem fighters have gathered on a strategic hill overlooking Sarajevo amid rumours of an imminent Moslem assault to break the Serb siege of the Bosnian capital. However, Mr Mik Magnusson of the UN Protection Forces (Unprofor) in Sarajevo said Unprofor troops had not been placed on any kind of alert as a result of the build-up.</p>

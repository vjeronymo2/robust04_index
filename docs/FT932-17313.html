			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / UK Company News: Macdonald Martin warns of setback SHARES in Macdonald Martin Distilleries, producer of Glenmorangie malt whisky, fell 53p to 390p yesterday after the company warned of a sharp decline in full year profits. Pre-tax profits for the year which ended yesterday are expected to be about Pounds 4m compared with Pounds 8.6m for 1991-92. The company said it intended to maintain an unchanged final dividend of 6.6p for A shares and 3.3p for B shares. The price of the B shares fell 50p to 600p Trading in the second half had continued to be affected by the price discounting and lack of consumer confidence that had cut interim pre-tax profits by 42 per cent, said Mr Neil McKerrow, managing director. 'Sales of proprietary whiskies have not reached expectations and the anticipated renewal of industry supply contracts has not materialised as a result of declining trading conditions.' Bulk blend sales, particularly to Australia and the US, had suffered volume and margin pressures, though losses had now been stabilised. Bottled blend volumes were ahead but there had been a substantial reduction in profitability. Glenmorangie volumes had fallen 12 per cent in UK duty free. Sales in other markets were stable, with encouraging performances in Japan, Germany, Spain and the Netherlands, but increased marketing expenditure had reduced profits.</p>

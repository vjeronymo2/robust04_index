			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Canada and Brazil gain TORONTO managed to end on a firm note after a lacklustre, featureless session kept drab by the closure of US markets, for the Memorial Day holiday, and also most European bourses, for Whitsun. The TSE 300 index put on 16.2 at 3,882.7 and rises outscored declines by 388 to 305 after volume of 37.3m shares. There were no significant changes among the sub-groups, with 11 higher and three lower. SAO PAULO rose 2.5 per cent initially, assisted by demand from mutual funds squaring positions ahead of the end of the account. The market slipped back later to leave a 1.4 per cent net gain, the Bovespa index closing 513 ahead at 35,406. Investors continued to focus on talks being held between Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the economy minister, and political leaders on ways to cut the budget.</p>

			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / The Queen's Awards 1992 (23): Breeders can benefit from Blup statistical predictions - Cotswold Pig Development A sophisticated computer- dating system for pigs has won Cotswold Pig Development an award for technological achievement. The Lincolnshire-based company has developed a breeding scheme to speed up genetic improvement in pigs and produce the consistently leaner, healthier pork that international markets now demand. It enables the performance, in terms of speed of growth and litter size, of the same genes on different farms to be compared for the first time, in effect separating hereditary and environmental influences. It uses a statistical technique, best linear unbiased prediction (Blup), which makes calculations based on detailed computer records kept on each pig's ancestry, development and habits. Once ideal mates to produce the next generation have been selected by the computer, the Cotswold system loses its similarity with blind dating agencies. Genes with desirable characteristics are brought together through artificial insemination. This means that genes can be spread around the country without having to move the animals, making the process much faster. Dr John Webb, genetics director at Cotswold Pig Development, says that he is carrying on a long tradition. 'Britain is pig breeder to the world. Britain invented the science of breeding,' he said. Cotswold has updated what pig breeders have been doing for centuries, and made the process far more accurate. Cotswold is the first livestock company to win a Queen's award for technological achievement, but according to Dr Webb, the pig breeding industry is a fertile ground for technological innovation. 'It is a small industry, high-tech, very competitive, with a very short technology transfer time. Because it is so competitive, it forces companies to get the technology in as soon as possible,' he says. The system which has won Cotswold the award was developed from technologies which have been available for a long time. 'Really, we have taken two technologies and married them. One was Blup, the other was artificial insemination,' says Dr Webb. 'The world has been very slow with many technologies. They sit on the back burner until somebody finds an application for them.' Blup itself was invented in the US 20 or more years ago and originally applied to cattle breeding. As cows produce only one calf a year, the calculations were much simpler. But pigs can have around two dozen offspring a year. 'It was not on to use this for pigs until we had very cheap, high-speed computing,' says Dr Webb. High rates of artificial insemination, around 80 per cent, were also needed. AI is not widespread in pig breeding - only 3 per cent of pig matings use it. Cotswold has developed the technique and now runs the largest AI centre for pigs in the world, using 360 boars a year. Old-fashioned breeding methods are able to produce leaner and hardier pigs, but find it difficult to increase litter size, as this is not a well-inherited trait. Cotswold's techniques have changed this. 'What Blup does is give us a very accurate projection of a pig's genetic merit for litter size. We can improve pigs born per litter by around one extra pig every five years, which in biological terms is quite a lot,' said Dr Webb. The system also makes it easier to breed pigs with characteristics tailored to specific markets. For example, conditions in south-east Asia are not always as 'pig-friendly' as in the UK, so hardier specimens can be bred to cope with the different environment. Four years ago Cotswold Pig Development won a Queen's award for its achievement in exporting pig breeding stock all over the world, from South Korea and the Philippines to Italy and France. Around half the pigs bred by Cotswold are for the export market. Dr Webb kept pigs as a teenager. He has become so attached to them that he prefers not to eat pork, but he describes that as a 'human frailty' and does not let his own personal prejudice interfere with business. 'There is nothing wrong with pig meat at all,' he says.</p>

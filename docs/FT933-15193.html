			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / Money Markets: French rates rise THERE WAS a sharp upward move in French franc money market interest rates yesterday after the currency came under strong pressure inside the European exchange rate mechanism, writes James Blitz. The French currency has been under pressure for some days amid concern about the deteriorating economic situation in France and speculation that the Bundesbank may not reduce short-term interest rates by as much as the Bank of France would like. Yesterday the fall in the currency had a pronounced effect on interest rate markets. Dealers took the view that the French authorities would be unable to cut interest rates by as much as they would like as long as the currency threatens to move close to its ERM floor against the D-Mark. French three-month cash rates rose sharply during the day, from about 7 per cent in the early European morning to a peak of 7.40 per cent on the bid side. In the afternoon some of this move was retraced and three-month francs closed at about 7.18 per cent. But this left them only 10 basis points below their German counter-parts, a striking indication of how the spread between money market rates in both countries has narrowed. Sentiment in French interest rate futures markets was equally downbeat. The Septem-ber Pibor contract dropped 31 basis points to finish at 93.24. At one stage the contract was traded at 93.21, bringing it only 7 basis points away from the equivalent Euromark contract. Dealers in sterling markets tempered their expectations for a base rate cut before the end of the year after sterling performed weakly on the foreign exchanges. However, the pound retreated about  1/2 pfennig against the German currency yesterday, forcing a slight retracement in interest rate futures. The September short sterling contract was down about 4 basis points at one stage, bottoming out at 94.21. It later climbed back to close at 94.27 as sterling staged a small recovery. The cash market reflected the slightly gloomier outlook on interest rates, with three-month money finishing  1/16 percentage point higher at 5 15/16 per cent. There was a large shortage of Pounds 2bn forecast at the start of trading, but much of this was removed by the Bank of England using a repurchase agreement in the early round.</p>

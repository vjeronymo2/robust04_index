			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / Small companies' cash restraint Poor access to finance means that Europe's small and medium sized enterprises are unlikely to provide a solution to the European Union's unemployment problem, according to a survey yesterday. Tipped by the European Commission to become the main source of jobs as European economies recover, more than half of Europe's smaller companies are not confident that they have sufficient finance to support their plans, according to a study of 5,000 companies in the 12 member states plus Austria, Sweden and Malta. Funding is most precarious in France, Greece, Italy, Spain and Austria but satisfactory in Belgium, Denmark and Holland. The survey showed that most smaller company finance is short-term. In the UK, 70 per cent fund their businesses with an overdraft, compared with only 37 per cent in Germany where loans are preferred. By contrast, more than 80 per cent of German companies favour loans of two years or more, against only 40 per cent in the UK.</p>

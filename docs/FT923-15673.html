			<p>920701 FT  01 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Chrysalis plans satellite TV game show channel CHRYSALIS, the music publishing, communications and media company, is planning to launch the UK's first game show channel on satellite television. The company has acquired the television rights to 14,000 American game shows and plans to run them non-stop for 18 hours a day. Chrysalis, in partnership with Mr Howard Huntridge, the television game show specialist, is trying to raise Pounds 15m for the venture. So far there has been little investment interest in the project from the UK and talks are about to begin with potential US backers. The aim would be to launch the channel on cable television in the autumn and move to the new Astra satellite a year from now. Negotiations are at an advanced stage with SES, the Luxembourg company that runs the Astra satellite system, for an option. Apart from advertising and sponsorship income further revenue is envisaged from viewers taking part in games by telephone and a television shopping segment.</p>

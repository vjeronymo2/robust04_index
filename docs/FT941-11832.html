			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Currencies The foreign exchange markets seem to be having some difficulty discerning which way US interest rates and therefore the dollar are heading. On Monday Mr Alan Greenspan said that the Federal Reserve would have to tighten some time, but gave no indication of when. That looked initially like a reprieve. Yesterday the purchasing managers' index for January turned out stronger than the market expected, especially in the areas of price and delivery times, both of which suggest capacity is beginning to be stretched. If that is so, an interest rate level originally set amid fears of a credit crunch looks less appropriate. Friday's employment figures may give a better lead, but the balance of expectation must be that the Fed is unlikely to act quickly. Fourth-quarter inflation figures showed inflation well under control, while the high rate of growth is expected to slow. The resignation yesterday of Mr David Mullins will remove another hawkish member from the Fed Board. It is thus more likely that when it does eventually tighten, the Fed will simply nudge rates gently higher. That is little comfort for those who have been banking on a strong appreciation of the dollar this year. In the short run they also have to contend with worries about the looming trade talks between the US and Japan which may yet see the US side talking the yen up. Expectations of a German rate cut this week are diminishing. There is a chance that the Bundesbank, which likes to surprise, may slip in a cut now that the D-Mark has revived. But there is little longer-term encouragement for the dollar if Germany is only prepared to cut interest rates when its own currency is strong.</p>

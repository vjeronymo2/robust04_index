			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The revised proposal also would provide significantly more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> guidance regarding the standards for approval of a plan. Commenters on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> December proposal were divided over the standards for approval. Some  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters thought the regulation should state that the standards for approval  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of a plan are the same as the standards on the lending, service, and investment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tests, or that the plan should require no less lending than the lending test. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contrast, some industry commenters thought that the plan would not provide a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> real alternative unless it permitted an institution to depart from the standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tests in responding to local needs. Under the revised proposal, a plan would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have to specify measurable goals for helping to meet the credit needs of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's service area, particularly the needs of low- and moderate-income  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> geographies and low- and moderate-income individuals. These goals would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have to reflect the institution's capacity and constraints, product offerings, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> business strategy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The revised proposal would require that the plan specify  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measurable goals in lending, investment, and the provision of services, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate to the circumstances. The proposal would specify the broad criteria  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in lending, investment, and services that should be the framework for the plan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> goals. At the same time, however, the proposal would make clear that an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution has great flexibility to fashion its program within those parameters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An institution would not be required to set levels of performance in all three  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> categories. In order to maintain the focus on lending for retail institutions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operating under a plan, a retail institution's goals would have to emphasize  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lending and lending-related activities, unless a different emphasis were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate given the credit needs of the service area, public comment, and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's capacity and constraints.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agencies intend through these provisions to provide guidance to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the industry and the community regarding the standards for plan approval,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> while preserving substantial flexibility for institutions to tailor their CRA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs. The purpose of the plan is not to provide institutions operating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under a plan with a different or lesser obligation to help meet the needs of their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> community; it is to provide more certainty and flexibility for those institutions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that wish to meet their obligation in a fashion that they believe may not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriately assessed by the standard performance tests.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The revised proposal would require that each plan specify  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measurable goals, the satisfaction of which, the institution believes, would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> warrant a ``satisfactory'' rating. An institution also would have the option of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identifying a separate set of goals that, if met, would warrant an ``outstanding''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rating. An institution would not be considered for a rating of outstanding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unless its plan contained outstanding goals that had been approved by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relevant agency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The revised proposal also would clarify how performance would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessed under the plan. The agencies believe that the standard of performance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the December proposal should be strengthened, and the revised proposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would require an institution to substantially achieve its plan goals to receive that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rating. This would apply to the satisfactory rating and, if the plan contained  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such approved goals, to the outstanding rating.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some commenters believed that the possibility of being considered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the standard tests, as contemplated by the December proposal, made the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plan a less attractive alternative to the standard tests. The revised proposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would, unless the institution chose otherwise, rate an institution's performance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under an approved plan solely in relation to its plan goals. An institution would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have the option, however, to elect in its plan to be subject to the standard tests  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should its performance under the plan goals be less than satisfactory. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies intend that an institution operating under an approved plan would,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during the period of the plan, never be subject to assessment under the standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tests, unless the institution so chose.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to industry comments that said the two year plan term  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the December proposal was too short to warrant the expense of preparing a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plan and to permit institutions to initiate activities with a longer view, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies have lengthened the possible plan term to 5 years, but would require  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the plan to have annual interim measurable goals. The agencies agree that it is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> beneficial to provide institutions the opportunity for long-range planning, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the interim goals should enable effective examinations during the plan period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposal also would permit an institution to develop a single plan for one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or more or all of its service areas and allow affiliated institutions to prepare  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> joint plans.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

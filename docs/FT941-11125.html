			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / Financial Times Round the World Ski Expedition: Many a welcome in the mountains But where is the mountain? We were desperately scanning the night sky for a glimpse of anything resembling a hill. At last we found a road which zig-zagged 16 miles into the sky and as we neared the resort of Bogus Basin in Idaho we were relieved to be dazzled by arc lights illuminating dozens of night-skiing trails. There have been some touch-and-go moments for Lucy Dicker, my companion, and I during the first month of our round the world expedition - but we're still on course to ski every day of 1994. Sceptical colleagues who accused us of taking a year-long holiday have been proved wrong as we have already endured illness (colds), injury (slight), and theft (cameras and credit cards), plus the welcome attentions of the North American media. We have, of course made mistakes: one bad one was to drive on an ordinary mountain highway instead of an interstate on our way to the windswept slopes of Mount Bachelor in Oregon. We drove for nine hours through a relentless blizzard and there were times we could not distinguish between the road and surrounding fields. Early in the night, we spotted a motel and were tempted to stop. But something felt wrong. Then we saw the name: in dimly-lit neon, Bate's Motel. My foot hit the accelerator and we hurtled into the night. Celebrities, such as actor Clint Eastwood, have wished us well and we have even become minor celebrities ourselves, receiving incredible welcomes everywhere we have been. One of the more dramatic was a mountain-top champagne reception and a huge banner at the top of Monument Peak at Heavenly in California. It was a moving sight, with giant red letters reading: 'A Heavenly welcome to Lucy and Arnie, round the world skiers.' Our odyssey began on new year's day at Jackson Hole in Wyoming, which we reached courtesy of American Airlines. A couple of days later we were at Sun Valley, Idaho, the grande dame of American ski resorts. Celebrities visiting Sun Valley over the years must almost have outnumbered the entire pre-war population of Aspen. Their photographs, lining the long museum-like corridors of the lodge, stare down at you: Gary Cooper, Marilyn Monroe, the Shah of Iran, Clark Gable, and Judy Garland. Lucy and I tip-toed down the corridor to snatch a glimpse of the restaurant where we were relieved to find the Maitre d', was most welcoming. When he discovered that Lucy was from his native Provence, he ushered use to the best table in the house and insisted on treating us like the Hollywood stars who had stepped off the train 40 years earlier. 'It is not every day,' he said, 'that we have someone in from Marseille.' Bogus Basin in Idaho got its name because in the 1860s rumours that there was gold here attracted prospectors from far and wide. But location became notoriously difficult to find and the 'gold' turned out to be pyrites. We had problems finding it too. Once settled in, however, Bogus provided some of our best snow and most picturesque skiing. An instructor called Bud Piggot (he pronounced it like Peugeot) skied with us through the tree-lined avenues of Brundage Mountain, Idaho. Much as he loves skiing, his preference is to roar over the slopes rather than down them - his passion is aerobatics in a Pitts stunt plane. After the Bates Motel scare on the way to Mount Bachelor, we recovered with an early brunch at the Sun River Resort and were ready for anything - including Mount Bachelor. Bachelor is a barely extinct volcano, with a snow-covered cone that permits almost 360 degrees of skiing. Unfortunately the top half of the mountain, with the most challenging skiing was enveloped in a cold mist, and neither visible nor skiable. At Mount Ashland, Oregon, we did manage to get above the grey ceiling that seems permanently to box the town in. Ashland is famous for its Shakespearean theatres and festivals and the resort, recently rescued from closure by local residents, has named many of its trails after Shakespearean plays and characters. It was as we left Ashland that we first saw the most beautiful mountain rising into the heavens in the distant Cascades, a series of single volcanic mountains. This one was special. Even from more than 100 miles away, we knew we had to ski at Mount Shasta. First, though, we had an appointment with the high Sierras surrounding one of the world's most beautiful stretches of alpine water, Lake Tahoe. Heavenly, above the lake, combines sunshine with a snow-making programme on the California and Nevada sides of the mountain. Nearby Squaw Valley turned out to be Lucy's favourite resort so far. With six mountains to choose from, we were spoilt for choice. One of them - Emigrant Peak - was a stark reminder of tragic events during the last century when many immigrants perished in their search for a way across the Sierras. People still perish today on Mount Shasta. More than 14,000ft high and riddled with glaciers, this noble peak attracts weekend hikers who set out to climb it in shirt sleeves as if it were an afternoon stroll. We hate to leave, but Washington awaits: 'Bluewood welcomes Financial Times' said the sign above the lift station. 'But what made you come here?' asked Stan Goodell, the owner, incredulously. Bluewood is scarcely known outside Washington and has only one serious lift, although it does give access to 22 trails. British Columbia's resorts made us so welcome we didn't want to leave. Silver Star, Big White and Apex are hoping to attract skiers from Europe who want to enjoy a variety of skiing in more than one resort. Each is only 90 minutes or so from Kelowna, from which skiers can ski all three areas. Unlike the others, Red Mountain, another British Columbian resort, has the old mining town of Rossland at its base. Canada's first ski competitions were held here just before the turn of the century. Although the skiing later expanded to another peak, Granite Mountain - where we skied Long Squaw, the best cruising run I have skied for years  - the resort has retained the original name. Panorama resort, whose outstanding views of the Canadian Rockies explain its name, has built a new T-bar to the top of the mountain called Top-Of-The-World. This gives the resort a vertical drop of 4,300 feet, second only to Whistler/Blackcomb (5,280 feet) in the whole of North America. And in Lake Louise, Alberta, we celebrated our first month on skis - so now it's on to the next month.</p>

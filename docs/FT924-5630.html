			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / International Company News: Shintom to close electronics factory THE decline in the world market for video equipment has forced Shintom, a medium-sized Japanese electronics company, to shut down production at its factory in Kofu, with 94 job losses. The outright closure of a factory and elimination of jobs is a rare event for a listed Japanese company and is symptomatic of the severe pressure facing the country's consumer electronics industry, which has huge excess capacity. Shintom has shed 242 full-time jobs in the past year, bringing its worldwide workforce down to 540. It is looking to reduce the workforce by another 150 through 'voluntary' retirement. Shintom's main business has been to produce video recorders on an original equipment manufacturer basis, and 90 per cent of its production is exported. Consolidated sales plunged to Y36.65bn (Dollars 295m) in the year to March 1992 from Y80.59bn in the previous year. The company posted pre-tax losses of Y7.31bn, against profit of Y75.98bn, and is expected to be in the red this year as well. Although Shintom hardly ranks as a pillar of the Japanese electronics establishment, the shutdown of production facilities is nonetheless an important part of a restructuring process that the Japanese industry must go through if it is to regain reasonable levels of profitability. Between the worldwide decline in video equipment sales and the rising value of the yen, Shintom found itself squeezed out of the market.</p>

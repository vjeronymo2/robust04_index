			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Valeriy Gromak report in the "Facts and Comments" column: </F> "To Moscow from Kaliningrad... Over Neutral Waters. We Shall  Have To Sustain Huge Expenses Unless Regulations Are Drafted for  Using the Air Space Between Russia and Lithuania"]    [Text] Today the skies over Kalinigrad Oblast (Russian  Federation) are legally controlled by a neighboring state --  Lithuania. More specifically, the Vilnyus Regional Air Traffic  Control Center. The working of Russian aircraft here fully  depends on the mood of foreign specialists or rather political  ambitions. Ways of resolving this problem were discussed at a  meeting between Petr Shirshov, chairman of the Russian Federal  Assembly's Security and Defense Committee, and Yuriy Matochkin,  chief of the Kaliningrad Oblast administration.    "Two years ago," Lt.-Gen. Vasiliy Proskurin, commander of  the  Baltic Fleet's Air Force said, "an interim agreement was  prepared between Russia and Lithuania on using the air space in  the region. It established procedures for aircraft passage from  the oblast's territory to Russia. But for reasons I am not  aware of it was not signed...."    The effects were immediately felt by Navy, Air Defense and  Border Guard pilots. An air "barrier" prevented their crossing  Lithuania's territory. It came to the point that one day the  Vilnyus Regional Air Traffic Control Center denied entry to the  Russian defense minister's plane. Now military aircraft, taking  off in Kaliningrad, fly over the sea to Liepaya and Riga and  then on to Moscow.    "We shall have to fly," Proskurin said, "over neutral waters  via the Gulf of Finland to St. Petersburg. This is quite a  detour and it will be expensive but there is no other answer so  far...."</p>

			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / International Company News: Dairy Farm earnings decline 3% DAIRY FARM International, Jardine Matheson group's food retailing arm, announced a 3 per cent decline in net earnings for 1991 as a result of the impact of acquisitions in Spain and New Zealand in mid-1990 and the effects of a price war in Australia. The company also announced it would follow Jardine Matheson in pushing for a primary listing in London with a secondary listing in Hong Kong if the Hong Kong Stock Exchange implements the changes in secondary listing requirements, which were hammered out following Jardine's threat to delist. 'This would enable us to be represented in a consistent regulatory framework over the long term,' said Mr Owen Price, managing director. The announcement had been expected. Dairy Farm's results were also in line with expectations. Profit after taxation and minority interests fell to Dollars 146.8m, from Dollars 151.8m, while turnover increased by 26 per cent to Dollars 4.62bn, from Dollars 3.65bn in 1990. The company had been rumoured to be announcing a rights issue, but Mr Price said that with a debt-to-equity ratio of 26.6 per cent and strong cash flow, there would be no need. And the company provided an optimistic forecast for 1992. Wholly-owned Australian supermarket chain Franklins succeeded in increasing market share during last year's price war, although profit margins were pared. Margins were expected to improve in 1992, he said. The company saw a maiden full-year contribution from recently-acquired Woolworths New Zealand, where a change of marketing strategy increased its share of the market, although sales were affected by the weak economy. Hong Kong operations continued to grow, but with high market share in a limited area, Mr Price indicated its Wellcome Supermarket sales would see slowing growth. The outlook for Taiwan was positive. The operations continued to lose money in 1991, but it emerged as the largest supermarket chain in the country and set up a central warehouse in Taipei, the rewards of which will be seen in 1992. Simago, the recently-acquired Spanish retail chain, remained a drain on both management and financial resources. Mr Price said large changes were implemented in 1991, with a significant retrenchment of staff, and 'we would expect an improvement in 1992'. At the year end, Dairy Farm had a total of 985 stores and a gross trading area of 10m square feet. The company recommended a dividend of 3.25 cents per share, making a full year dividend of 4.6 cents, the same as 1990.</p>

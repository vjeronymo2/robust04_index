			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / International Company News: Sales decline at Goodyear GOODYEAR Tire &amp; Rubber, the last surviving big US tyre-maker, yesterday unveiled a considerable first-quarter net loss on declining sales. The Ohio-based company had warned it would post a first-quarter loss, and shares in the company added Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 21 3/8 by the close on the New York Stock Exchange. The company, which has cut jobs, restructured and slashed its dividend in a bid to return to profitability, expects to be back in the black in the second quarter if the economy in North America improves. But Goodyear's problems run deeper than the recession and decline in vehicle production. The company is struggling under the burden of its disastrous Dollars 1.6bn investment in the All American Pipeline, an oil pipeline from California to Texas that is operating at only a fraction of capacity and has had to be written down. Goodyear expects these operations to eat into earnings for at least two years. Stripping out extraordinary items, Goodyear suffered a loss of Dollars 30.4, or 52 cents a share, in the first three months of 1991, against profits of Dollars 16.5m, or 29 cents, a year earlier. In the 1991 quarter, Goodyear took a one-off, after-tax charge of Dollars 59.7m, or Dollars 1.02 a share, related to job cuts and the discontinuation of its efforts to establish a tyre factory in South Korea. In the 1990 quarter, the company had extraordinary gains of Dollars 4.4m, or 7 cents a share. Including the one-time items, Goodyear's net loss for the 1991 quarter was Dollars 90.1m, or Dollars 1.54, against net income of Dollars 20.9m, or 36 cents a share. The company said the downturn in the tyre and rubber industry reduced first-quarter worldwide sales by 7.2 per cent to Dollars 2.5bn. In the US, operating income dropped to Dollars 30.1m from Dollars 82.8m a year ago, partly reflecting unusual charges of Dollars 34m in the 1991 quarter. Sales fell 9.5 per cent to Dollars 1.4bn. Weak demand reduced Goodyear's tyre sales by 7.5 per cent. Operating income fell to Dollars 62.8m, including one-time charges of Dollars 46.9m, from Dollars 129.9m. The company's oil transportation business extended its operating loss to Dollars 25.1m from Dollars 14.6m, reflecting losses on oil sales in spite of reduced operating expenses.</p>

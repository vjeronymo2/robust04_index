			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The general command of the Organization of the  Vanguards of the Popular Liberation War, al-Sa'iqah Forces, has  issued as statement, which said: The Zionist enemy forces  perpetrated an abhorrent crime at the Ibrahimi Mosque, adding a  fresh outrage to its long list of crimes to promote its  genocidal policy against our Arab people and liquidate their  national cause.    This new Zionist crime is a natural corollary of the  capitulatory agreement signed by 'Arafat with the Zionists in  Oslo and Cairo and a consequence of the policies of  relinquishment and capitulation pursued by 'Arafat and his  deviationist methods.    We promise our people to remain faithful to our cause and  national struggle and the martyrs' blood until all Palestinian  territory is liberated.</p>

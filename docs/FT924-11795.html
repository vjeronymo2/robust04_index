			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / Observer: One job too many? 'Don't ask me where I'll find the time', says David James, one of Britain's best-known company doctors, who now wants to add membership of the governing council of Lloyd's of London to his heavy caseload. James already works 80 hours a week in his role as chairman of Lep Group, Eagle Trust and Davies &amp; Newman. He has been a Name at the insurance market for 10 years and currently trades Pounds 850,000 on the market. He says that he 'cottoned on' to the problems of the spiral reinsurance syndicates - which account for half of Lloyd's last reported loss of Pounds 2.06bn, and believes that many of the Names facing heavy losses were 'totally ignorant of what they were getting into'. Tate and Lyle boss Neil Shaw, who is also chairman of the Association of Lloyd's members, says that he is impressed by James and his 'no-nonsense grasp' of the issues now facing the insurance market. Hence the ALM is taking the unusual step of backing James for the one vacancy for an external member in this year's elections. However, James already has more than enough to worry about without trying to advise Lloyd's on its problems. If British Airways does come to the rescue of Dan-Air, perhaps he may have more time available. But it won't have done his reputation much good.</p>

			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Flexello talks to third party FLEXELLO Castors &amp; Wheels, the Berkshire-based manufacturer of castors and trolley wheels, announced that it is in discussions with a third party with a view to strengthening its financial and commercial position. The group said that the discussions taking place may or may not lead to an offer being made for the company. The shares have moved sharply in the past week, gaining over 20 per cent from 87p on April 25 to 105p at Wednesday's close. Yesterday they fell to 97p on the news. Flexello also warned that due to difficult trading conditions results for the six months to end-March were likely to be significantly worse than those for the comparable period. At the previous interim stage Flexello incurred a loss of Pounds 377,895 (profit Pounds 507,987). In the year to September 30 1990 the deficit was Pounds 497,000 compared with profits of Pounds 949,000 in 1989. The lapse into losses was due largely to destocking by its distributors.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Because the SMCRA deadline is procedural, OSM can evaluate Colorado's counterpart provisions under a ``same as or similar to'' standard in determining whether a proposed State procedure is consistent with and in accordance with SMCRA and no less effective than the Federal regulations. The only difference in the procedure is an extra 30 days, which increases the amount of time for the regulatory authority to carry out its review responsibilities and does not prejudice a permittee's right to due process. For these reasons, OSM considers the extra 30 days to be reasonable and finds that Colorado's procedure itself is similar to the procedural requirements of section 519(b) of SMCRA and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.40(b)(2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, based on the above discussion, the Director finds that the revisions proposed by Colorado at Rules 3.03.2(4)(c) and 3.03.2(5) are in accordance with and consistent with SMCRA and no less effective than the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.40(a)(2), (b)(2), and (f), and approves them.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 10. Rules 3.06, Bonding Requirements for Construction of Mine Drainage Control Facilities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Colorado proposed to delete in its entirety Rule 3.06 (including Rules 3.06.1 through 3.06.3), concerning special bonding requirements for construction of mine drainage control facilities. Colorado's Rule 3.06 contains exemptions, from several of Colorado's bonding requirements, for special reclamation techniques.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rule 3.06 has no counterpart in the Federal program. The exemptions it provides, however, are less effective than the bonding requirements concerning the determination of bond amount, long-term periods of liability, and bond release in the respective Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.14, 800.17, and 800.40. In addition, Colorado's program at Rule 3 includes the counterpart provisions to these Federal regulations, which conflict with the existing exemptions at Rule 3.06. The proposed deletion of the exemptions at Rule 3.06, therefore, removes less effective provisions from the Colorado program and, at the same time, remedies an internal conflict in the Colorado program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, the Director finds that Colorado's proposed deletion of Rule 3.06 is consistent with and no less effective than the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.14, 800.17, and 800.40, and approves it.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Summary and Disposition of Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Following are summaries of all substantive oral and written comments on the proposed amendment that were received by OSM, and OSM's responses to them.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Public Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OSM invited public comments on the proposed amendment, but none were received.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Federal Agency Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to 732.17(h)(11)(i), OSM solicited comments on the proposed amendment from various Federal agencies with an actual or potential interest in the Colorado program (administrative record Nos. CO&hyph;615 and CO&hyph;641). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The U.S. Bureau of Mines responded on May 12, 1994, that it had no comments (administrative record No. CO&hyph;614). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers responded on May 25 and September 8, 1994, that the proposed amendment was satisfactory (administrative record Nos. CO&hyph;618 and CO&hyph;647).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service (SCS), responded on May 26, 1994, by stating that (1) it supported the proposed deletion of the use of first-lien security interests from the definition for ``collateral bond'' at Rule 1.04(25); and (2) regarding the proposed deletion of the requirement for bond liability on disturbed lands that are outside of the permit area from Rule 3.02.1(4), it believed mining companies should be liable for all lands that are disturbed by their activities regardless of the relative location of these lands. SCS also questioned (1) who would be responsible for site-specific standards of success for revegetation proposed at Rule 3.03.1(2)(b); and (2) whether there would be language proposed to replace the proposed deletion of Rule 3.02.4(2)(c)(ix), regarding real and personal property as a form of collateral bond, and Rule 3.06, regarding special bonding requirements for construction of mine drainage control facilities (administrative record No. CO&hyph;619).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

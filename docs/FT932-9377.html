			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / Japan irked by rejection of whale plan A JAPANESE request for a harvest of 50 whales in its coastal waters was rejected yesterday by member nations of the International Whaling Commission, which are still deeply divided over a controversial proposal for a sanctuary in the southern oceans. Japanese officials again threatened that the country would leave the IWC if it continues to rule against a limited resumption of commercial whaling, while the commission has virtually split into two camps and is unable to agree on when to discuss sensitive issues, let alone to agree on decisions. A majority of the 34 nations represented at the IWC's annual meeting in Kyoto supported a resolution condemning the 'research' whaling programmes of Norway and Japan, which last year caught 330 minke whales in the Antarctic region. The vote annoyed Japanese representatives, who argue that the research is necessary to ensure the health of the whale population. Japanese officials were also unhappy that a majority of nations voted against the quota of 50 whales under a scheme known as community-based whaling. Tokyo had hoped to win approval for the concept of community whaling, which, it says, would involve the local consumption of whale products and not commercial sales. But in spite of the setbacks, and the threats to leave the IWC, UK and US officials expect that Japan will remain in the commission, as it would be a loss of face for the country to withdraw when hosting the annual meeting. Tokyo is also known to be wary of irritating the US government, which is taking a strong line on environmental issues. The commission's meeting is due to end today, and its reputation will suffer if member countries are unable to agree to vote on the sanctuary proposal or on a management scheme for whale stocks, supposed to be concluded at this gathering. Five nations, including Brazil and Sweden, proposed that the sanctuary vote be deferred for a year, but supports of the sanctuary, which would last for 50 years and be reviewed after 10 years, are still pushing for vote even though they are certain not to get the three-quarters majority required.</p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Baghdad AL-THAWRAH in Arabic on 23, 24,  25, and 27 March 1994, and Baghdad BABIL in Arabic on 26 March  1994 publish articles by Iraqi columnists on the latest UN  Security Council debate over the Iraqi blockade. All articles  note a "development" in the UN Security Council stance, saying  now that Iraq has fulfilled its obligations, Security Council  members should honor their resolutions "despite any endeavor by  the United States to continue the blockade." However, while  most articles hail "the new UN stand" as a development "in  Iraq's favor" and predict "great victory" soon, one columnist,  while acknowledging this development, thinks Iraqis have been  too euphoric, and warns local papers against playing up the  "split," saying "our papers have been carried away by this game  of nations."    Baghdad AL-THAWRAH in Arabic 23 March carries in its  "Standpoint" column on page two a 700-word article by Mu'ayyad  'Abd-al-Zahrah entitled: "The Security Council Must Honor Its  Resolutions!" The article says Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq  'Aziz's intensive deliberations and contacts with UN members  have led to "further international understanding of and clear  sympathy with Iraq's rights and legitimate demands." Referring  to the "Iraqi message of facts" which 'Aziz submitted to the  Security Council, the article says: "Facing the Security Council  with the facts and asking it to stand by its decision had fully  exposed the situation so that it was no longer acceptable for  anyone to remain silent." "The message," the article adds: "was  echoed by several permanent member states, which acknowledged  Iraq's positive steps toward and tangible cooperation with the  UN resolutions." The article concludes: "Thus, the new change  occurred as a result of Iraq's steadfastness and firm struggle  as well as its people's courage and patience in adversity. The  coming days portend the harvest of a great victory over the  tyrant and the collapse of the unfair blockade."    The paper also publishes in its "Attention" column on page  three a 300-word article by Hasan al-Kashif entitled: "The  Blockade and the Requirement." Al-Kashif says due to "absolute  U.S. and British hostility to Iraq" those Security Council  members "who acknowledged Iraq's commitment and cooperation with  the United Nations are alone qualified to represent  international will." He adds: "Washington has chosen to be the  enemy of Iraq and this is its own affair. But, if it wants to  express its dirty options, it should do so outside international  legitimacy. At any rate, This is not something new to the  United States, which is blockading Cuba due to an American  decision with which no one agrees. Therefore, it can, if it  wants, remain captive to its failure before Iraq's willpower.  But it has no right to ask the international community to adopt  a stand which is not based on legitimacy or law. It cannot  justify the murder of Iraqi people through hunger and disease."    Baghdad AL-THAWRAH in Arabic 24 March publishes in its  "Standpoint" column on page two a 700-word article by 'Adil Sa'd  entitled "The International Change and the Internal  Requirement," saying: Two factors were behind "the creation of  a significant majority in the Security Council calling for a new  approach" Iraq's cooperation with the UN resolutions and its  citizens' "great patience and ability to adjust to hardships."  Sa'd calls upon the government, headed by the Prime Ministry,  to make up for the citizens' endurance internally by improving  public services and being "very tough with the renegade  parasites and horders who speculate on people's livelihood."    Baghdad AL-THAWRAH in Arabic on 27 March carries in its  "Standpoint" column a 500-word article by 'Isa Ismail al-'Abbadi  entitled: "The Blockade In a Bottleneck." Al-'Abbadi says  contacts inside and outside UN lobbies between Iraq and world  nations indicate that the blockade "is in a bottleneck and its  continuation can no longer be justified by anyone," despite  "contradictions" in recent statements by Ekeus, chairman of the  UN Special Commission, "who, in one press interview, says he  cannot now say that he is completely satisfied with what he has  achieved in Iraq concerning the implementation of what was  requested by the Security Council, and in another press  interview says that he is 'completely satisfied' with what he  achieved in Iraq in this regard, but also adding that he cannot  now recommend lifting the blockade on Iraq." Al-'Abbadi  concludes by saying that in view of these contradictions "It is  essential for the Security Council to consider the facts as they  stand without being influenced by the biased political  influences of the United States."    Baghdad BABIL in Arabic 26 March 1994 publishes on page two  an article by Mazhar 'Arif entitled: "The Security Council and  the Game of Nations!" (filed as JN3003215794) in which he warns  lraqi news media against playing up the "split" in the Security  Council by raising citizens' hope about "an impending  breakthrough," saying what took place was "a game of nations,"  and the outcome was "a gain for the United States, and not for  Iraq."    Baghdad AL-THAWRAH in Arabic 25 March 1994 carries in its  "AL-THAWRAH Diary" on page eight an article by Wadi' al-Muzaffar  entitled: "A Pledge by Marsh Arabs." The item says since  President Saddam Husayn's "historic speech" to the Iraqi cabinet  on Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 'Aziz' mission to the UN Security  Council to lift the blockade, Ba'th Party offices in the ,  al-Basrah Governorate witnessed continuous tribal rallies in  support of the president. The item says tribal chiefs and  citizens "armed to the teeth" poured into those offices  "demanding to volunteer as fighters against evil aggressors."  The item reports on one particular rally in a tribal camp in  the marshlands, where an 80-year old tribal chief addressing his  sons and grandsons says: "The mean, treacherous act of the  Americans and Zionists in blockading Iraq and depriving our  people of food and medicine, and their flying of their crows in  our airspace on the pretext of protecting us have driven me  crazy." He pledges: "We stand behind the leader Saddam Husayn  with all we possess: soul, spirit, and the tribe."</p>

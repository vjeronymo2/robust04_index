			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 23/4/1994 -- "Partnership for  Peace" [PFP] was the theme of a session held in plenum Saturday,  23 April, afternoon, during the Bucharest conference of the  Crans Montana Forum.    Chaired by Charles Thomas, ambassador in the United States  Department of State, and by Jean-Paul Carteron, president of the  Forum Foundation, the session occasioned a presentation of  opinions regarding the Partnership for Peace.    In his address, Gheorghe Tinca, Romanian minister of  defense,  stressed that the Partnership for Peace was the sole initiative  to start the evolution process that could ensure security in  Central and Eastern Europe, while Romania's adherence was  proving the will to integrate within European and Euro-Atlantic  structures.    Approaching the political dimension of the initiative, the  speaker stressed that the ensurance of indirect guarantees for  security could eliminate any discrimination among states, but in  the conditions of tempering integration at various speeds, that  could lead to new separation marks on the continent, so that the  security of any country should not be conceived to the detriment  of other countries participating in the partnership.    In the opinion of Petre Roman, president of the Democratic  Party (National Salvation Front), the Partnership for Peace is a  serious step towards NATO's widening and consolidation.    Stressing from the very beginning on the need for security,  Jean Freymond, director of the Geneva Center for Practical  Studies on International Negotiations, assessed that the Eastern  and Central European countries should not indulge in illusions  of joining NATO, "illusions that might be turned tomorrow into  disappointment".    The conclusions over the debates were however optimistic,  the  Partnership for Peace being viewed as a fundamental contribution  to the security and stability, to consolidation of democratic  structures and of the process of transition in Central and  Eastern European states.</p>

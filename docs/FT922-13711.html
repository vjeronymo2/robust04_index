			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / Fears of collapse behind a brave front: Worries about prospects for industrial survival in Northumberland BULLDOZERS are levelling the ground for a Pounds 40m industrial estate on the site in the Wansbeck district of Northumberland where thousands of men went underground to dig for coal for more than a century, earning the town of Ashington the tag of 'largest pit village in the world'. A road, funded partly by EC money, now bypasses Ashington town centre. From it the view of British Alcan's Lynemouth power station and aluminium plant, one of only two big smelters in Britain, dominates the skyline. A few miles south is National Power's Blyth power station. Slightly north of the smelter, just outside Wansbeck district but drawing most of its workforce from within it, is Ellington colliery, a profitable pit with large reserves, where pit ponies work alongside the newest technology at coal faces eight miles under the North Sea. If Wansbeck is compared with many of Britain's traditional mining areas, where pit closures have left no manual jobs for men, Wansbeck may seem fortunate. In just six months, however, it has suffered nearly 700 direct job losses from Alcan, Blyth power station and Ellington, the coalfield's last pit, raising fears of the total collapse of the area's three biggest industrial employers and the loss of 2,400 mostly male jobs in an area where 3,000 men are already unemployed. According to a newly-published report commissioned by a working group comprising the area's local authorities, MPs, unions and some employers, Wansbeck can either resign itself to the collapse of its primary industries or fight to improve their survival prospects by promoting their potential in a 'greener' future of clean coal technology, sustainable energy and recycling. The report, A Future for South East Northumberland, produced by John Tomaney of Newcastle University's Centre for Urban and Regional Development Studies for the Newcastle-based Trade Union Studies Information Unit, recommends the 'green' option. The area's political leaders agree. Mr John McCormack, Labour leader of Wansbeck council, says: 'We haven't lost all the major industries yet; this report is saying before it gets too late there are steps which can be taken to preserve what we've got. We're very much at the crossroads. If the right decisions are made we can pull out of this.' A moratorium on building gas-fired power stations, a brake on pit closures and coal imports and abandonment of British Coal's privatisation - all proposed by Labour before yesterday's election - would raise the survival chances, at least in the short term, of Blyth power station and Ellington pit, earmarked for closure in the Rothschild report commissioned by the last government. Other items on Wansbeck's lobbying list - a more generous regime of inward investment grants, an Enterprise Zone and state intervention to aid the survival of Alcan's smelter on the grounds of UK strategic importance - would be prickly issues for any government. Wansbeck's problem is, ironically, partly due to earlier success in building on its traditional industry with Blyth power station and Alcan, both of which are big coal-burners. When the government reviewed regional policy in the early 1980s, Wansbeck's unemployment problems were not considered acute enough to justify continuation of its top-tier status. It was demoted to intermediate-area status, hampering its fight with other parts of north-east England for inward investment from development-area grants to incoming employers, development corporations and enterprise zones. Wansbeck's failure to win any significant inward investment in the past decade has heightened its dependence on a shrinking coal industry; deep mining in Northumberland has shrunk from 60 pits employing 40,385 men when the industry was nationalised to one, Ellington, with 1,657 men, plus Ashington workshops, employing 240. Ellington, producing only industrial coal, sells half its 2m tonnes annual output to Alcan at Lynemouth; Blyth power station is also a big customer. However, Alcan has been badly hit by a steep worldwide drop in aluminium prices, which last winter forced it to halve production from Lynemouth. Mr Paul Belanger, managing director of Alcan's UK primary and recycling division, supports the emphasis in Mr Tomaney's report on aluminium's future potential because of its potential for recycling. But Mr Belanger says there is 'no immediate optimism' about any rapid improvement in the market. Blyth power station, opened in the 1960s, would in any case now be nearing the end of the average coal-fired station's 40 -year life. Its prospects have been worsened by the creation of a competitive electricity generating market and the 'dash for gas' - the construction of a wave of gas-fired stations - and uncertainty over the generators' future demand from British Coal once the present supply contract expires next March. Mr Tomaney's report suggests that Blyth and Ellington could be linked to form a demonstration site for clean coal technology, the only one of its kind in Britain. National Power says any such departure would have to be judged on its economic viability. Undeterred, Mr McCormack is now enlisting more employers to help promote Wansbeck's cause. 'We feel it will have more weight in lobbying Westminster and Europe, no matter who is in power, if we can say the whole community is represented and we're speaking with one voice.'</p>

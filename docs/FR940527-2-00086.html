This prohibition does not apply to such an individual where one of the exceptions described in section 202(t)(2) through 202(t)(5) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 402(t)(2) through 402(t)(5)) affects his or her case.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 202(t)(2) of the Social Security Act provides that, subject to certain residency requirements of section 202(t)(11), the prohibition against payment shall not apply to any individual who is a citizen of a country which the Secretary of Health and Human Services finds has in effect a social insurance or pension system which is of general application in such country and which:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Pays periodic benefits, or the actuarial equivalent thereof, on account of old age, retirement, or death; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Permits individuals who are United States citizens but not citizens of that country and who qualify for such benefits to receive those benefits, or the actuarial equivalent thereof, while outside the foreign country regardless of the duration of the absence.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary of Health and Human Services has delegated the authority to make such a finding to the Commissioner of Social Security. The Commissioner has redelegated that authority to the Director of the Office of International Policy. Under that authority the Director of the Office of International Policy has approved a finding that the Republic of Yemen, beginning June 9, 1992, does not have a social insurance or pension system of general application in effect which pays periodic benefits, or the actuarial equivalent thereof, on account of old age, retirement, or death.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, it is hereby determined and found that the Republic of Yemen does not have in effect, beginning June 9, 1992, a social insurance or pension system which meets the requirements of section 202(t)(2)(A) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 402(t)(2)(A)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This finding is also relevant regarding the application of subparagraph (A) and (B) of section 202(t)(4) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 402(t)(4) (A) and (B)). That section provides that, subject to certain residency requirements of section 202(t)(11), section 202(t)(1) shall not be applicable to benefits payable on the earnings record of an individual who has not less than 40 quarters of coverage under Social Security or who has resided in the United States for a period or periods aggregating 10 years or more. However, the provisions of subparagraphs (A) and (B) of section 202(t)(4) shall not apply to an individual who is a citizen of a foreign country that has in effect a social insurance or pension system which is of general application in such country and which satisfies the provisions of subparagraph (A) of section 202(t)(2) but not the provisions of subparagraph (B) of section 202(t)(2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with the finding herein, the limitation on payment of monthly benefits to aliens included in section 202(t)(1) does not apply to citizens of the Republic of Yemen receiving benefits on the earnings records of individuals who have not less than 40 quarters of coverage under Social Security or who have resided in the United States for a period or periods aggregating 10 years or more.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </ACTION> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Terry Fahey, room 1104, West High Rise Building, 6401 Security Boulevard, Baltimore, MD 21235, (410) 965&hyph;3566.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> (Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance: Program Nos. 93.802 Social Security_Disability Insurance; 93.803 Social Security_Retirement Insurance; 93.805 Social Security_Survivors Insurance)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FURTHER> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> James A.

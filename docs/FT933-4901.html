			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / Policy on IRA faces scrutiny THE BRITISH government is likely to be forced to mount a defence of its rules of engagement against the IRA before the European Court of Justice. The Strasbourg-based European Commission of Human Rights ruled yesterday that the controversial killings of three IRA members in Gibraltar five years ago could be heard by the European Court. The ruling was hailed as a significant victory by relatives of the victims who have argued that the shooting violated the European Convention of Human Rights, guaranteeing the right to life. The case was taken to Strasbourg after a Gibraltar coroner's inquest - at which evidence was withheld by the government on grounds of national security - declared the killings lawful. Special Air Service (SAS) soldiers said they killed the three IRA members under the Ministry of Defence's 'rules of engagement', which permit soldiers to open fire if there is a threat to life. It was declared in the coroner's court that the SAS soldiers had acted after being briefed that the three IRA terrorists had planted a bomb in Gibraltar linked to them by remote control, and that they were probably armed. Relatives of the family have always contended that the killings were unnecessary as British intelligence had information from their Spanish counterparts that they were not armed. The commission yesterday signalled it had doubts about the case, although its support for a full court action will not be published for a month. The Foreign Office said last night that the UK government remained 'convinced' that the SAS soldiers acted 'lawfully'. One Foreign Office official said: 'If the case is brought to the European court, our defence will be vigorous.' Whitehall has been advised by its legal experts that the case could take anything between a year and six years to unravel. The Irish government, which initially condemned the killings, yesterday refused to comment publicly on the case. Dublin officials privately indicated that they had no wish to become embroiled in the case at a European level for political reasons. However, legal experts working for Amnesty International, the group which campaigns for human rights, predicted last night that any eventual ruling by the European Court against the government could force changes to legislation in the UK and bring the definition of the justified use of force closer into line with the con-vention. Amnesty believes that although the court's decision would not be directly binding in UK courts, British authorities could find it difficult to ignore.</p>

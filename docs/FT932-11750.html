			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / Law Society loses first round in legal aid battle THE LAW Society yesterday lost the first round of its battle with the Lord Chancellor over legal aid. The solicitors' governing body failed to persuade the High Court to block Lord Mackay's proposals to change the way in which solicitors are paid for criminal legal aid work in magistrates' courts. The society had accused Lord Mackay of acting outside his powers under the 1988 Legal Aid Act by replacing hourly-based fees with a standard fees system. The Lord Chancellor's desire for economy had overridden the need to act both lawfully and rationally, it said. But Lord Justice Leggatt, sitting with Mr Justice McCullough, said once the court was satisfied the Lord Chancellor had not acted illegally and that his decision was not so absurd that it could be said he had taken leave of his senses, it was 'no part of its function to adjudicate on the merits of an administrative scheme'. The judge said it was evident that Lord Mackay had exercised the broad discretion given him by parliament under the 1988 act to introduce the new system and Lord Mackay had taken account of all the factors he was required to. He suggested that the Law Society might wish to take stock of the wisdom of continuing its challenge. 'It might do better to see how the amended scheme works and then press for improvements,' he said. After the hearing Mr John Appleby, chairman of the society's courts and legal services committee, said they would take advice before deciding whether to appeal. 'It is now clear the powers the Lord Chancellor was granted under the Legal Aid Act are wider than anyone had previously thought and that he can restrict access to justice simply by cutting or restricting lawyers' fees,' he said. The society believes the new scheme will overpay some lawyers and underpay others. Mr Appleby stressed that the society's separate legal challenge to the government's legal aid eligibility cuts was unaffected by yesterday's decision. That case will be heard at the end of May. Red Hot Television, the satellite pornography channel, is 'more likely to fail than succeed' when it challenges a UK broadcasting ban in the European Court, the Court of Appeal said yesterday. Giving its reasons for refusing to grant the channel an injunction against the government's decision to impose a ban, the court rejected Red Hot's argument that the High Court judges who originally refused an injunction failed to consider the prospects of success in Europe - one of the factors which affect the granting of such injunctions.</p>

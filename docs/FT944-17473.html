			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow softens ahead of crucial jobs data Wall Street US share prices gave ground for the third session in a row yesterday as equity investors braced themselves for today's crucial jobs data, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 11.78 lower at 3,775.56, while the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 slipped 1.16 to 452.36. The Nasdaq composite receded 2.09 to 744.19 but the American SE composite bucked the trend, gaining 2.49 at 453.60. On the New York SE, declining issues outpaced advances by a slim margin after moderate volume of 271.4m shares. Stocks opened weaker but limped back to near their starting levels by mid-morning. There was no important economic news released, and the bond market was taking a break after a long spell of turbulence which had driven prices lower in recent weeks. But the charged atmosphere was expected to return with a vengeance this morning. With the Labor Department set to release its monthly report on the employment market, investors were calculating the odds of the Federal Reserve responding with a move to lift interest rates again. Economists were expecting to see an increase in non-farm payrolls of about 250,000. If the gain was close to 300,000 - a figure which would indic-ate a spurt of economic act-ivity - many thought it was likely that the Fed would act immediately. During the afternoon, the selling pressure picked up a little pace, pushing several of the Dow components lower. International Paper retreated Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 76 3/8 amid a general downturn in paper and pulp issues. General Motors dropped Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 43 7/8 , pulling down Chrysler Dollars 1 to Dollars 44 1/8 and Ford Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 27 1/8 . JP Morgan was off Dollars 1 at Dollars 59 1/4 but Procter &amp; Gamble climbed Dollars 1 to Dollars 59 7/8 . The session was enlivened by the announcement of an attempt to derail an agreed merger between two big railways. Union Pacific weakened Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 50 on the disclosure that it had filed a lawsuit seeking to force Santa Fe Pacific to entertain its rival takeover offer. Santa Fe's share price added Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 13 3/8 in the wake of the move, while Burlington Northern, its would-be partner, relinquished Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 48 7/8 . Salomon, the Wall Street investment bank, slipped Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 37 7/8 after warning that it would report an after-tax loss of Dollars 100m for the third quarter. The market was generally non-plussed by the release of monthly sales data by the leading retailers, although Kmart receded Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 16 7/8 . Sales in stores opened at least a year were up a tepid 2.8 per cent, and the company warned of a decline in third-quarter earnings. On the Nasdaq market, Apple Computer gave back Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 36 1/4 in heavy volume of 4.7m shares. The stock had jumped in the previous session on speculation that Motorola was interested in acquiring the company.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Andrey Aderekhin, IZVESTIYA correspondent: </F> "Extraordinary Measures for Combatting Crime Introduced in  Kuban"]    [Text] The decree of the head of administration, "On  Extraordinary Measures for Combatting Crime," has been  introduced into operation in Krasnodar Kray. The preamble of the  document states that the criminal situation which has arisen in  the kray creates a real threat to political, economic and social  transformations.    By coincidence, on the eve of the appearance of the decree,  Krasnodar had buried four victims of crime. Two men in masks had  broken into the jewelry store "Zhemchug," and shot the  salesgirl, a customer and the duty militiaman with an automatic  weapon. Another woman was wounded by a stray bullet. During the  ensuing chase and gun battles which took place in crowded  places, one more militia worker was killed. Later, during the  capture of the robbers, one of them was killed... According to  the decree, the internal affairs agencies must significantly  increase the density and mobility of units of the militia  patrol-duty service.    Among the measures introduced were operations for preventing  and curtailing the activity of armed groups, as well as a set of  measures for maintaining the safety of citizens in places of  possible inter-ethnic conflicts.    The document devoted much attention to outsiders. Those who  violate the public order will be deported outside the boundaries  of the kray. Anyone who is not carrying documents shall be  detained and placed in receiving-distributing centers until  their identity can be established.    Some measures are extraordinary. Thus, the agencies of the  tax police, if they are unable to collect taxes due to the  budget and other mandatory payments, receive the right to impose  administrative arrest (seizure) of the property of legal persons  and individuals and to later sell it through auctions.    Juveniles are also not overlooked. It has been decided "to  limit the presence of minors under 16 years of age in public  places after 10:00 p.m. without their parents or persons acting  in lieu of them."    One of the points of the decree is an innovation, although  the mechanism of its realization has not yet been explained. "In  necessary cases, to provide for the allocation of facilities for  the temporary residence of persons who have become victims of  domestic violence, to create publicly funded counselling centers  for provision of legal and other aid to citizens in the  resolution of social-domestic conflicts."    Aside from the internal affairs agencies, military  servicemen  of the internal troops and Cossack social organizations will  also be involved in the fight against crime. The heads of the  law enforcement agencies have been told to implement  organizational measures for utilizing the capacities the kray's  radio and television broadcasting network for emergency  transmission of current announcements.    Citizens who report the whereabouts of especially dangerous  criminals who have committed or are planning to commit serious  crimes will be given a monetary reward in the amount of up to 5  million rubles (R).    The extraordinary measures, the need for which Russian  Minister of Internal Affairs Viktor Yerin pointed out during his  recent visit to Kuban, shall remain in effect up until 1 October  of this year.</p>

			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Straw condemns education record LABOUR yesterday fiercely attacked the Tories' record on education and said additional annual spending of Pounds 600m would raise standards for every child, of every level of ability, Andrew Bolger writes. Mr Jack Straw, shadow education secretary, said reading standards had gone down since 1987. 'From the Tories we've not had standards, but double standards - a few children in opt-out schools and city technology colleges favoured, while the needs of the rest are neglected.' Labour promised to set and achieve ambitious targets to secure a nursery education for every child whose parents wanted it, and to raise the staying-on and achievement rates for pupils over the age of 16.</p>

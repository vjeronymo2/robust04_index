			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Luidmila Aleksandrova] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 22 TASS -- The State Duma, the Russian  parliament's lower chamber, endorsed on Friday the government's  bill on state pensions. According to the bill, a minimum monthly  pension benefit in Russia is fixed at 19 thousand roubles from  May 1 and all other pension benefits will be increased 1.3  times. Inflation compensation of 19700 roubles will be paid in  addition to pension benefits as before. The difference between  maximum and minimum benefits will increase twofold (comparing to  1.85 times at present).    The bill, which is also to be approved by the Federation  Council, the upper chamber, will provide the adjustment of  pensions to the price growth, taking into account the financial  resourses of the pension fund. In spite of many critical  remarks and proposals, the lawmakers decided to endorse the bill  allowing the payment of new benefits to begin from May 1, but  the work to improve the pension laws will continue. However,  some proposals, including on the government's power to fully  regulate pensions, were withdrawn from the bill.</p>

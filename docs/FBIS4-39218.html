			<p>BFN     [Text] Vilnius, Jun 06, BNS -- Lithuanian President  Algirdas Brazauskas on Monday signed the recently adopted law on  government, which comes into effect next week.    In his traditional Monday radio interview this week,  Brazauskas said outlays on government will not increase,  although the number of ministries will grow from 16 to 19.    The president said changes within the Cabinet do not mean  that a government of experts will be replaced by government of  politicians. Brazauskas emphasized that ministers must be both  politicians and experts.    Commenting on the creation of the new Environment Protection  Ministry instead of the currently existing department, which is  subordinate to the parliament, Brazauskas said it is not normal  that an institution of the executive branch belongs to the  legislative branch. Besides, he said, such ministries exist in  nearly all countries around the Baltic Sea. Similar structures  should deal with such problems as pollution of the sea,  Brazauskas said.    Discussing division of the Culture and Education Ministry  into two separate ministries, the president said these  institutions were merged artificially and the step proved to be  incorrect.    In Brazauskas' words, the new Municipal Affairs Ministry  will  not be very big, but is needed to carry out government reforms  "from the top to the bottom."</p>

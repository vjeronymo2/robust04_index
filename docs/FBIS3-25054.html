"Mandela, give us a volkstaat [homeland] or you'll have total  war in South Africa," the AWB leader said at an Afrikaner  Volksfront [Afrikaner National Front] (AVF) rally at the  Lichtenburg showgrounds in the Western Transvaal. The  400-strong crowd cheered wildly when the AWB leader made his  threat.    Earlier, quoting private security companies, Mr Terreblanche  said 41 bombs had exploded in the Western Transvaal in the past  few days. "Professionals are destroying South Africa's railway  tracks to fight the ANC.... More explosions will occur from  tonight (Saturday)," he said.    In a disparaging reference to the National Party (NP)  election campaign to gain black votes, Mr Terreblanche said the  NP had become "a party of kissing (black) girls and garden  kaffirs".    At the same rally AVF leader Tienie Groenewald said,  evidently contradicting Mr Terreblanche, the AVF would use any  peaceful means to achieve its goals. Pessimistic about the  final round of talks between the Freedom Alliance, the  government and the ANC on Monday, Gen Groenewald said he  expected no settlement at the end of this negotiation phase.  The AVF had been told that there would be no more concessions,  he said. "We now have to face the reality of resistance," he  said, stopping short of using the term armed resistance.    Gen Groenewald conceded the government had made some  concessions in the latest round of talks, but there had been no  backing down by the ANC on the powers of regions which were  unacceptable to the right wing. "But from Monday we will  systematically put pressure on the ANC and the government to try  and reach our objectives."    The third speaker at the meeting, Conservative Party (CP)  leader Ferdi Hartzenberg, said during a heavy downpour that the  CP leadership would meet next Thursday to consider its options  regarding the April elections.    AVF convenor Gen Constand Viljoen, who was scheduled to have  addressed the rally, did not arrive. No reason for his absence  was given.</p>

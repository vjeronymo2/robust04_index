			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Meaningless Moves"] </F>   [Text] During their repeated tours of the Middle East,  U.S. and Russian officials have shown eagerness to emphasize  that the two large co-sponsors of the regional peace process  want to promote this process and remove it from the critical  atmosphere that has overwhelmed it. They also stress that the  success of this peace process depends on commitment to the basic  principles stipulated in the Madrid conference that unleashed  the peace negotiations between Israel and the Arab parties  directly concerned with the Arab-Israeli conflict.    If we review what the peace process has thus far achieved,  we  will simply find that it continues to face one major obstacle,  represented by the issue of Israeli withdrawal from the occupied  Arab territories. Such a withdrawal is a basic principle.  Peace cannot be achieved or entrenched without implementing  this principle in accordance with the resolutions of  international legitimacy, particularly Resolutions 242 and 338.  Moreover, without a full and comprehensive Israeli withdrawal  from all occupied Arab territories, any talk about peace will  continue to move in a vicious circle, so any achievement on the  path of peace will merely be like building peace on sand.    The repeated visits to the region by the U.S. secretary of  state and the Russian envoys, as well as the continued  consultations held bilaterally and collectively as part of the  bilateral and multilateral negotiations, have thus far failed to  effect a clear Israeli commitment to full withdrawal from the  occupied territories. The issue of withdrawal is still part of  the Israeli maneuvers designed to fragment the Arab side, set  timetables, propose phased solutions, and give only in  installments. This will deprive the land-for-peace principle of  both the meaning and legitimacy according to which the peace  process was launched in the first place. The issue of full  withdrawal in exchange for full peace is an essential link in  any comprehensive solution that will securely resolve all issues  pertaining to both the Palestine question and the overall  conflict in the Middle East. However, this fact, which is  ignored by the U.S. and Russian co-sponsors, has failed to spare  the peace efforts of the Israeli attempts designed to conclude  partial and separate deals.    The emphasis by the U.S. and Russian governments on their  good intentions, as well as the Arab parties' commitment to both  the peace process and its principles, are not sufficient to  force Israel into committing itself to the bases and principles  of peace as long as such statements are nothing more than  utterances of mere diplomacy. Political moves, whether U.S. or  Russian, should be serious in order to promote the peace process  in the right direction. These moves should be joined by the  Israeli side, which rejects the concept of full withdrawal in  exchange for comprehensive peace on all fronts of the conflict.  Otherwise, the visits, moves, and tours will continue to  revolve in a vicious circle of action and reaction, and they  will never succeed in pushing the peace process forward.</p>

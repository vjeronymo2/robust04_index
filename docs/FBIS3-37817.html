			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksey Kuznetsov] </F>   [Text] Delhi, 19 Feb -- Russia has an interest in  maintaining stability in the Indian Ocean area to prevent  regional conflicts here, Admiral Feliks Gromov, commander in  chief of the Russian Navy said today at the end of his visit to  India, in an interview with an ITAR-TASS correspondent. He held  talks in Delhi with the Indian Republic's Naval Commander  Admiral V.S. Shekhawat, was received by Defense Minister M.  Mallikarjun, visited naval bases in Vishakhapatnam and Bombay,  and also visited a warship.    It is no secret that in the past two years the level of  military-technical cooperation between Russia and India has seen  a decline and that the rupture of economic links between the  countries of the CIS and the transfer to a new system of  interstate calculations account for much of this, Gromov said.  Therefore, the talks and meetings that have been held here have  centered on problems connected to the resumption of bilateral  ties on the basis of agreements arrived at during Russian  President Boris Yeltsin's visit to India in January 1993. These  documents are now being qualitatively implemented where they  relate to military-technical cooperation, in particular in  weaponry matters and orders for spare parts, mechanisms, and  materials. Furthermore, there are opportunities for organizing  the exchange of experience in the tactics of the art of war and  in personnel training.    The Russian military leader expressed hope that the creation  in Moscow of Rosvooruzheniye with the aim of settling all  matters from the sale of arms through to their technical  servicing and use in one package would provide for the smooth  functioning of deliveries. We have taken it upon ourselves to  work more closely with this new structure in order to meet our  obligations to India, he said.    The commander in chief praised the level of maintenance at  Indian bases, ships, and training equipment and the training of  servicemen. All categories without exception -- from admiral to  sailor -- display a conscientious attitude to the fulfillment of  their duties. There are elements that we could adopt during the  transition to the construction of Russia's Armed Forces on a  new, professional basis.    The entry into Bombay of a detachment of the Russian Pacific  Fleet consisting of the large Admiral Vinogradov antisubmarine  vessel, the large Admiral Vilkov landing vessel and the Viktor  Kolechitskiy tanker was timed to coincide with Gromov's visit.  By agreement with the command of India's Navy, the first  Russian-Indian exercises since the dissolution of the USSR were  held in the Arabian Sea, during the course of which, according  to the admiral, individual elements of military activity were  tested: The establishment of communications, joint maneuvers,  work with aerial and underwater targets, and the use of  helicopters. A decision was made to conduct similar maneuvers  in the future.</p>

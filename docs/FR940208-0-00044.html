			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Director finds this proposed revision to be no less effective than the Federal requirement and is approving it. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 21. IAC 27&hyph;40.39(8), IAC 27&hyph;40.67.1, and IAC 27&hyph;40.67(3), Coal Preparation Plants Not Located Within the Permit Area of a Mine <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Iowa proposes to revise IAC 27&hyph;40.39(8) to require that the following clarifying sentence be added to incorporated 30 CFR 785.21(a): ``An off-site processing plant operated in connection with the mine but off the mine site will be regulated without regard to its proximity to the mine.'' Iowa also proposes to add a rule at IAC 27&hyph;40.67(1) that would delete the Federal regulation 30 CFR 827.1 from Iowa's incorporation by reference of 30 CFR Part 827. Finally, Iowa proposes to add a rule at IAC 27&hyph;40.67(3) that states ``[p]roximity shall not be the decisive factor in deciding to regulate an offsite processing plant.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These proposed rule changes are in response to, and satisfy, required program amendments placed on Iowa's program at 30 CFR 915.16(a)(6) and (13) in a November 6, 1991 (56 FR 56578, 56594&hyph;56595), rulemaking action. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These proposed rule changes are also in accordance with OSM's latest clarification of its position regarding regulation of off-site coal preparation plants. In a final rule  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice published on January 8, 1993, (58 FR 3466, 3468) OSM stated its position as follows: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> OSM's position on the proximity issue, as clarified today in this final rule, is that surface mining regulatory authorities may consider geographic proximity as a factor in determining whether off-site coal processing facilities operate in connection with a mine as long as proximity is not the decisive factor. To allow proximity to be the decisive factor would render ``in connection with'' equivalent to ``at or near.'' That is not the Secretary's intent. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Therefore, the Director finds Iowa's proposed rules at IAC 27&hyph;40.39(8), IAC 27&hyph;40.67(1), and IAC 27&hyph;40.67(3) to be consistent with the Federal program and is approving them. The Director will amend 30 CFR 915.16(a) by removing the required program amendments at 30 CFR 915.16(a)(6) and 30 CFR 915.16(a)(13). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 22. IAC 27&hyph;40.51(7), Bond Release Application <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Iowa proposes to revise its rules at IAC 27&hyph;40.51(7) to modify 30 CFR 800.40(a)(2), as incorporated by reference into the Iowa program, by deleting the phrase ``Within 30 days after an application for bond release has been filed with the regulatory authority, the permittee shall submit a copy of an advertisement placed'' and inserting in its place the following: ``After an application for bond release is deemed complete by the division, an advertisement shall be placed by the permittee within 30 days of the date of notification of completeness.'' In addition, Iowa proposes to add the following sentence after the first sentence of 30 CFR 800.40(a)(2), as modified: ``The permittee shall submit a copy of the advertisement to the division within 30 days of the last publication.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.40(a)(2) do not require a permittee to obtain a ``notification of completeness'' prior to placing an advertisement announcing an application for bond release. Under the Federal regulations, the advertisement is placed within 30 days after the application has been filed with the regulatory authority. Iowa proposes to delay the advertisement until it can verify that the application is complete. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While the concept of requiring a permittee to obtain a notification of completeness prior to placing the advertisement is not considered less effective than the Federal program, the implementation of this concept would render Iowa's program less effective than the Federal program because of the inherent contradiction this revision would create in the State rules regarding applicable time limits for the processing of bond release applications. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

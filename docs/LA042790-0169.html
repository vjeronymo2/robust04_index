			<p><P> April 27, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SMALL MISTAKE SHOULDN'T BE SEEN AS RACISM  </P> <P> Your premise that a black golfer, Roy, was mistaken for a car wash attendant  (Family Life Column by Mike Spencer, April 5) because of some stereotyping  plants the idea that blacks can suspect that all slights by people of other  races are racially motivated. Wrong. People of all colors can be insensitive  and oblivious to the feelings of others on any given day. Furthermore, being  mistaken for someone working should not be a personal affront. Since our  lifestyles and attire are so casual, it is frequently difficult to distinguish  the servers from the served.  </P> <P> The hard-working, clean, pleasant, young people who work in our car wash in  Laguna Hills are part of the self-supporting, taxpaying sector of our society.  My husband and sons often man the gas pumps and vacuum and move cars, while my  daughter has spent many hours at the cash register. Would you be offended to be  mistaken for the owner of a multimillion-dollar establishment or just his  employee? Would you know the difference?  </P> <P> To deny that racism exists is to deny truth. To attribute small slights,  misunderstandings, unkindness and rudeness to racism fosters unhealthy paranoid  attitudes in the minds of the recipients of such incidents. Most of these  occurrences are as impersonal as being cut off by a truck on the freeway.  </P> <P> Roy was a victim of a racial slight only if he allowed himself to think he was.  How insignificant the event was, and if that was the worst thing that happened  to him, he had a pretty good day. He handled the situation correctly while you,  on the other hand, would have created a potentially chaotic situation, and the  business people trying to accommodate you would have born the brunt.  </P> <P> Your effort to teach us to be sensitive to racial differences was made at the  expense of people who do not measure up to your standard of social equality.  There is more than one kind of discrimination. You are making class  distinctions to create your own "pecking order" and sense of worth. You would  be more constructive (and democratic) to advocate that we respect all others,  regardless of race or job status.  </P> <P> No one likes to be snubbed.  </P> <P> We all behave better if we're appreciated.  </P> <P> Perhaps you can be more aware of your own obvious propensity toward class  consciousness and how that can lead to rude, overly aggressive behavior.  </P> <P> Carinel Stamos,  </P> <P> Villa Park  </P></p>

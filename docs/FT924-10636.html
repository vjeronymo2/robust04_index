			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / European Court finds Ireland at fault over abortion information ban Ireland has been found to have violated human rights for banning two pregnancy counselling clinics from providing information to women on how and where to obtain abortions abroad, Tim Coone writes. The European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg ruled yesterday that the 1988 ban, ordered by an Irish Supreme Court injunction, had violated a right to receive and impart information, information which was in any case available elsewhere from telephone directories or through contacts abroad. The European Court awarded the two clinics a total of IPounds 194,000 (Pounds 208,000) in costs and damages. Ireland has a constitutional ban on abortion dating back to 1983.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Each supplier of an engine or transmission shall determine the country of origin once a year for each engine and transmission. The origin of engines shall be calculated for engines of the same displacement produced at the same plant. The origin for transmissions shall be calculated for transmissions of the same type produced at the same plant. Transmissions are of the same type if they have the same attributes including: Drive line application, number of forward gears, controls, and layout. The U.S. and Canada are treated separately in making such determination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The value of an engine or transmission is determined by adding up the prices paid by the manufacturer of the engine/transmission for each component comprising the engine/ transmission, as delivered to the assembly plant of the engine/transmission, and the fair market value of each individual part produced at the plant. All value added at the engine/transmission plant is otherwise excluded from the calculation of origin. Individual parts refers to the most basic level of parts used to assemble an engine or transmission and not subassemblies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Determining the country of origin of components.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Except as provided in (c)(2), the country of origin of each component is the country which contributes the greatest amount of value added to that item.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Instead of making country of origin determinations in the manner specified in (c)(1), a manufacturer may, at its option, use any other methodology that is used for customs purposes (U.S. or foreign), so long as a consistent methodology is employed for all components.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Determination of the total value of an engine/transmission which is attributable to individual countries <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The value of an engine/transmission that is attributable to each country is determined by adding up the total value of all of the components installed in that engine/transmission which originated in that country.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) The country of origin of each engine and the country of origin of each transmission is the country which contributes the greatest amount of value added to that item of equipment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;583.9  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Attachment and maintenance of label.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Attachment of the label.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Except as provided in (a)(2), each manufacturer shall cause the label required by &sect;583.5 to be affixed to each new passenger motor vehicle before the vehicle is delivered to a dealer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) For vehicles which are delivered to a dealer prior to the introduction date for the model in question, each manufacturer shall cause the label required by &sect;583.5 to be affixed to the vehicle prior to such introduction date.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Maintenance of the label.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Each dealer shall cause to be maintained each label on the new passenger motor vehicles it receives until after such time as a vehicle has been sold to a consumer for purposes other than resale.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) If the manufacturer of a passenger motor vehicle provides a substitute label containing corrected information, the dealer shall replace the original label with the substitute label.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) If a label becomes damaged so that the information it contains is not legible, the dealer shall replace it with an identical, undamaged label.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=3 --> &sect;583.10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=3 --> Outside suppliers of passenger motor vehicle equipment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> (a) For each unique type of passenger motor vehicle equipment for which a manufacturer or allied supplier requests information, the outside supplier shall provide the manufacturer/allied supplier with a certificate providing the following information:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The name and address of the supplier;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) A description of the unique type of equipment;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The price of the equipment to the manufacturer or allied supplier;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) A statement that the equipment has, or does not have, at least 70 percent of its value added in the United States and Canada, determined under &sect;583.6(c);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) For equipment which has less than 70 percent of its value added in the United States and Canada, the country of origin of the equipment, determined under &sect;583.7(c);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) For equipment that may be used in an engine or transmission, the country of origin of the equipment, determined under &sect;583.8(c);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) A certification for the information, pursuant to &sect;583.13, and the date (at least giving the month and year) of the certification.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8) A single certificate may cover multiple items of equipment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The information and certification required by paragraph (a) of this section shall be provided to the manufacturer or allied supplier no later than 45 days after receipt of the request, or the date specified by the manufacturer/allied supplier, whichever is later.

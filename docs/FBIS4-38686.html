			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, 2 Jun (ITAR-TASS) -- Russia has every reason  to be optimistic about the prospects for relations with the  Republic of Korea [ROK]. Russia regards relations between the  two countries as those of constructive good-neighborliness.  Russian President Boris Yeltsin said this at a joint news  conference today with ROK President Kim Yong-sam.    President Yeltsin said that at the talks with the ROK  president, which ended in Moscow today, Russia's task is "not so  much to take stock of what has been done, as to ensure that  there is a good future for cooperation, that the leap forward  which we made in 1992 should continue, that our relations should  become stronger, and that our fundamental accords should be  filled with new specific deeds."    Boris Yeltsin said that a new Moscow declaration has been  signed with the president of Korea. In his opinion, it is "a  major political document looking solely to the future." The  Russian president believes that following the treaty on the  fundamentals of bilateral relations, signed in Seoul in November  1992, this declaration is "a new step forward in mutually  beneficial cooperation." In the opinion of Boris Yeltsin, an  agreement to start next year on a regular exchange of young  people will enable the peoples of Russia and Korea to learn more  about one another, and also looks to the future.    "We have said many times", the Russian president stressed,  "that we are interested in full-scale economic relations, that  we would like to see a growth of investments by South Korean  firms in our economy, especially in the Far East."    Boris Yeltsin believes that active participation by the  companies of the Republic of Korea in the conversion of Russian  military industry could also become mutually beneficial. The  Russian president said that some considerable mutual  understanding has been reached on these issues.    At the talks with the Korean president, considerable  attention was paid to examining the situation on the Korean  Peninsula in the context of nuclear non-proliferation. Russia,  as Boris Yeltsin stressed, "is extremely worried at the  unsettled nature of the nuclear question in this region, and  Russia bases itself on the premise that the DPRK should remain a  fully fledged member of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty,  and should fully implement its commitments under the  verification agreement with the IAEA."    "This is our fundamental line," the Russian president  stated.    "At the same time," he pointed out, "we consider that it is  necessary to tackle the North Korean nuclear problem by  political methods, without damaging the legitimate interests of  all the sides involved therein."    One way of resolving this problem, Boris Yeltsin stressed,  lies in implementing a Russian proposal on an international  conference on security and the nuclear-free status of the Korean  Peninsula, with the participation of Russia, both Korean states,  the United States, China, Japan, and also representatives of the  United Nations and the IAEA.    At the talks with Kim Yong-sam, the question of the 100,000  ethnic Koreans of Russian citizenship living in Russia was also  touched on. "On our part," Boris Yeltsin noted, "it was  stressed that Russian Koreans, like all Russians in our  multi-ethnic country, have the right to state support, to the  maintenance of their culture, language, and customs, and  development of links with their historical motherland."</p>

			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / Survey of Finland (8): Pulp, paper industry turns corner - Forestry AFTER TWO years of heavy losses, Finnish pulp and paper companies have turned the corner. Some groups will remain in the red in 1993, but enough of them will be profitable to give the industry as a whole a break-even result. This represents a considerable improvement on last year's combined loss of FM4.2bn, and 1991's FM5.2bn deficit. Whatever help the industry has had, it has not come from the market. Hopes that prices would turn decisively this year have been badly disappointed, and expectations for next year are already being toned down, particularly as far as the key west European market is concerned. Instead, the Finns have had to rely on their own efforts and a hefty 30 per cent devaluation of the markka to ride out the storm. All the major companies have rationalised heavily, cutting staff numbers by up to 30 per cent, and they have conceded little in the way of wage rises in the last two years. Added to this has been a 32 per cent fall in wood prices since 1991, which has lowered the raw material costs of the pulp mills significantly. The depreciation of the markka has also helped, but it has not proved as big a benefit as originally hoped. Buyers have also wanted their cut from devaluation's benefits, forcing prices down still further. For some products, such as sawn goods and fine papers, markka prices today are virtually the same as they were a year ago. The collapse in the market, particularly for pulp and fine papers, is the principal reason why the Finnish forestry industry will manage only to break even rather than make a profit this year. The other factor is the high debt load which the major Finnish groups continue to carry following their hefty investment programmes in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Combined debts at FM70bn are as big as turnover, and since more than 60 per cent of them are denominated in foreign currencies, they have risen sharply because of the weaker markka. In 1991 and 1992 around half of the industry's losses were attributable to currency losses. On the short-term perspective, Finnish groups clearly over-invested on the back of the boom market conditions of the late 1980s, even though they now have the world's most modern and efficient pulp and paper machinery to show for it. The emphasis was different in Sweden where the big forestry groups concentrated their expansion more on company and plant acquisitions in Europe. Some argue that the Swedish tactic was better, because it facilitated the removal of extra capacity in the market downturn, though it has also left the Swedes with greater production capacity in hard currency countries. The debt burden has forced the Finnish forestry industry to consolidate. Total investment will fall to an annual FM4.5bn this year and next, compared with FM8bn a year in 1989 and 1990. There are currently only two major projects on the blocks: a DM800m scheme to build a newsprint plant, based on recycled paper, in eastern Germany and a FM3bn plan to construct a new pulp mill at Rauma in western Finland. Other projects may only see the light of day as part of a risk-sharing collaboration between different groups. Balance sheet constraints are also likely to limit takeover activity, unless industrial logic - or distress - can be cited to justify it. For one thing, there has already been a considerable shake-out in the Finnish forestry sector, and for another, the 1980s argument that it made sense to buy in Europe cannot be sustained today when Finland has become a low cost producer again. 'Priority number one over the next two years will be repaying debts,' says Mr Jarl Kohler, managing director of the Finnish Forest Industries Federation. Enhanced cash-flow, disposals and share offers will all feature in the drive for a stronger balance sheet. Mr Kohler acknowledges that 1994 will be another tough year for the Finnish forest companies, but he nevertheless expects an overall profit for the industry, thanks to the trends which have begun to emerge. Firstly, the industry has been able to raise its capacity utilisation from 83 per cent in 1992 to 87 per cent this year. For sawn wood the jump has been from 81 to 92 per cent, and for newsprint from 82 to 91 per cent. But some sectors are still very depressed - utilisation for uncoated (SC) paper has fallen to 77 per cent this year from 83 per cent, while pulp utilisation rates have climbed only to 85 per cent from 83 per cent. Secondly, in spite of the recession, worldwide paper consumption is continuing to grow, albeit at a m o d e s t 1 - 2 per cent a year. Thirdly, exports have been growing strongly: they are predicted to rise by 10 per cent in volume terms and 14 per cent in value terms during 1993. The gains have come despite the fact that western Europe, which last year accounted for 80 per cent of Finnish forest industry exports, has been in recession. Increased sales to North America, Asia, the former eastern bloc and Latin America account for all but a tenth of the increased export volume. If the short-term outlook is relatively positive, questions remain about how well placed Finnish forest companies are to meet long-term competitive challenges. The threats come not just from trends like recycling and greater computerisation, but from expanded production in current export markets - such as Indonesia - and from the ability of rivals with stronger balance sheets to exploit market opportunities. The Finns do not appear to be unduly alarmed by their position. They point out that with their emphasis on higher value-added products and their modern machinery, they are as well placed as any of their competitors to take advantage of an upturn in market conditions. The broader question is whether Finland should be trying to reduce its dependence on an industry which accounts for as much as 50 per cent of its net exports and which is highly capital intensive. The answer is almost certainly yes. Mr Henrik Ehrnrooth, chief executive of Jaakko Poyry, the international consultancy group, says the country is 'definitely' over-dependent on forestry. 'But it's hard to change,' he notes, 'when forestry tends to attract the country's best brains.'</p>

In the  afternoon Mr. Cindoruk visited the National Assembly and talked  with National Assembly Chairman Aleksandur Yordanov.    [Begin Cindoruk recording, in Turkish fading into Bulgarian  translation read by Tsenkova] Except for sending Turkish Blue  Helmets to Bosnia-Herzegovina, we did not have any other issues  on which our opinions were not similar, Cindoruk said. He also  added that it was not so much a difference of opinions on that  issue but rather a different interpretation of the UN decision.    However, according to Mr. Yordanov, the participation of  Turkish blue helmets in the Yugoslav conflict will revive the  historical memories of the population in the region. A modern  policy cannot be based on memories. According to Aleksandur  Yordanov, the Bulgarian position is correct, balancing, and  moderate. It requires from all countries to stay away from the  conflict, even if they feel equally engaged in the situation in  former Yugoslavia.    The positions of the two countries on developing Black Sea  economic cooperation also were discussed.    At the moment the Turkish parliamentary delegation is  meeting  the minister of foreign affairs.</p>

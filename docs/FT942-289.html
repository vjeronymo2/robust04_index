			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / FT Review of Business Books (23): Their finest hour - Unions / Robert Taylor on the final volume of Clegg's history A History of British Trade Unions since 1889 Volume III 1934-1951 by Hugh Clegg Oxford University Press, Pounds 55 458 pages Now that they are virtually banished by government to the fringes of influence, it is hard for many people to recall the days when Britain's trade unions were a mighty power in the land. The lasting value of Professor Clegg's lucid and comprehensive account is to provide a reminder of an earlier period of this century when the unions played a central role in Britain's political and industrial life. Neither the leaders of the main political parties - Conservative as much as Labour - nor most employers regarded the trade unions between 1934 and 1951 as an obstacle to progress in the market economy, let alone as the enemy within. On the contrary, Clegg shows how both the state and many companies sought to work with and not against them. In the early - and best - chapters he provides a convincing vindication of the 1930s as 'one of the most productive periods of state intervention in industrial relations'. Not only did the 'dismal decade' produce a strong economic recovery but a significant growth in trade union membership and a substantial expansion in collective bargaining, mainly at the initiative of conciliatory employers. Above all, the unions, through the Trades Union Congress, found they could do business with the national governments of Stanley Baldwin and Neville Chamberlain without compromising their independence. The steady rapprochement between organised labour and government during the 1930s was achieved by what Clegg calls the 'strange' but highly effective 'partnership' forged between TUC general secretary Sir Walter Citrine and Ernest Bevin, general secretary of the Transport and General Workers union. Both men - aptly described by Clegg as 'the two most remarkable leaders the British trade union movement has ever produced' - disliked each other intensely but they worked in harness for over 20 years. While Bevin was 'imaginative, generous (though he could also be domineering) and passionate', Citrine was the opposite - 'deliberate, systematic, calculating'. What they had in common was a pragmatic and clear-headed view of the role of the trade unions in a democratic society. To a great extent, they achieved most of their aims for organised labour under the terrible exigencies of total war. Following Lord Bullock's masterly volume on Bevin's years as Minister of Labour and National Service in Churchill's wartime coalition, published over 20 years ago, Clegg provides an overdue assessment of the important but neglected role the trade unions played in the achievement of victory over Nazi Germany. It was that period - from May 1940 to May 1945 - which turned out to be organised labour's 'finest hour'. Neither before nor since have Britain's trade unions exercised such a decisive and positive influence. Their achievement was seen not just at national level through the growth of the corporate state but also in the workplace where the joint production committees mobilised with success in the war effort. Much of Britain's manpower planning was carried out through draconian powers acquired by the state but to a remarkable extent - thanks mainly on Bevin's insistence - workers and their unions were able to retain their autonomy. The core values of the voluntarist tradition of industrial relations remained more or less intact. Although Clegg endorses the domestic achievements of the post-war Labour government in establishing full employment and creating the welfare state, he argues that after 1945 the trade unions began to lose influence. In part, he pins the blame for this decline on the 'poor calibre' of the next generation of union leaders who lacked the abilities of their predecessors. But Clegg also questions the wisdom of Mr Attlee's government in eventually demanding union co-operation for wage restraint. In retrospect, he believes this was 'perhaps a mistake from the start'. In more socially disciplined Scandinavia national incomes policies might have been possible but in Britain he believes they 'are best avoided' due to the decentralised and fragmented character of workplace bargaining and the lack of central authority that trade unions can exercise over their members. Most of his life, Clegg was an advocate of incomes policies - a member of the long defunct Prices and Incomes Board and chairman of the short-lived Pay Comparability Commission scrapped by Mrs Thatcher - but not apparently any more. Indeed, beneath the corporate bias that grew up between the trade unions and the state from the early 1930s, Clegg pinpoints another and more enduring trend of workplace unionism based on the shop steward movement. It was the 'centrifugal' tendency - compounded by 'complicated pay structures and multi-unionism' - that gave British industrial relations its distinctive character, particularly in the post-1945 conditions of full employment and relative worker affluence. The volume is - like its two predecessors produced over the past 30 years - accurate and cogent. Clegg may not be an evocative writer: he restrains his enthusiasms behind a dry, matter-of-fact style. Essentially, his view is from on high but he has an inspiring story to tell which nobody who is interested in the history of the 20th century Labour movement can afford to ignore.</p>

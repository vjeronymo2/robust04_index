			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg May 1 SAPA -- Four major counting  centres, controlling ballots which represent the largest slice  of the election results, were running way behind schedule with  counting by Sunday [1 May] evening. These facts emerged from  internal Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) reports received  on the status of the counting process country-wide at 8PM on  Sunday.    Umtata, Durban, Pretoria and Nasrec [National Exhibition  Center] all reported massive backlogs while the North West,  Western Cape and Northern Cape had almost completed their count.    By 8PM the OFS [Orange Free State] reported that more than  half the votes in the province had been counted.    Information from some regions were sketchy on completed  counts but most counting stations reported progress indicating  that many tallies were ready to be verified and released by IEC  HQ soon.    Difficulties seem to focus on Durban's counting, where the  8PM report recorded that of its 60 stations 32 were not counting  and at 28 there had been no reconciliation. A crisis team had  been sent to deal with the problem.    At Umtata only six of the 61 stations had completed  counting,  50 were counting and two were still reconciling.    In the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] region the  bottleneck, expected to take counting into late Monday or even  Tuesday, has occured at Pretoria and at Johannesburg's Nasrec  Centre. Pretoria has reported zero per cent completed, with the  counting stage just reached and the releases of counted batches  only just starting.    At Nasrec the report recorded that counting officers were  still unsure of procedure and monitors were assisting with the  process. Randburg Bryanston, Sharonlea and Marlboror were all  complete.    Vereeniging reported nine per cent complete, the West Rand  52  per cent, East Rand 47 per cent and Johannesburg 15 per cent.  All told, 24.6 per cent of the counting at the PWV's 141  stations had been completed.    The following regional statistics were given:    -- Western Cape: Cape Town 48 stations out of 58 completed  counting with Vredendal and Beaufort West complete.    -- Orange Free State: Welkom nine out of 17 completed,  Kroonstad 11 of 12, Bloemfontein 19 out of 30, Bethlehem 10 out  of 15. But they are also counting the additional QwaQwa station  which was added on Sunday morning.    -- North West: Rustenburg 18 out of 21 completed, Mafeking  five out of 11, Klerksdorp all completed by 7PM, Vryburg eight  out of 11.    -- Eastern Transvaal -- Ermelo 20 out of 28 completed with  four counting, Witbank 16 out of 19 completed.    -- KwaZulu/Natal -- Durban nul out of 60 stations completed,  Empangeni four out of 20, Newcastle five out of 19,  Pietermaritzburg four out of eight, Port Shepstone two out of 18.    -- Northern Cape -- 20 stations out of 32 completed, with De  Aar and Upington expected to be finished shortly after reporting  time.    -- Northern Transvaal -- Ellisras both stations still  counting, Nylstroom one station reconciling and two out of the  four counting, Pietersburg 15 out of 21 counting and five  reconciling, Phalaborwa six completed out of 20, Thohoyando two  completed out of 14, with one still reconciling.    -- Eastern Cape -- Port Elizabeth 12 out of 27 completed,  East London ten out of 19, Queenstown completed, Umtata six out  of 61 completed.    Foreign voting at the DHL warehouse at Isando was reported  as  still proceeding very slowly.</p>

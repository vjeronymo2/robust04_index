			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Daimler-Benz and Mitsubishi link up for marketing deal GERMANY'S Daimler-Benz and Japan's Mitsubishi, two of the world's largest industrial groups, yesterday agreed to a package of measures aimed at marketing each other's goods and increasing co-operation in recycling. The agreements were unveiled last night in Berlin following 3 1/2 years of discussions and several co-operation agreements. Mr Edzard Reuter, chairman of Daimler-Benz, said: 'This kind of co-operation between two huge industrial groups is still considered unique.' Mr Shinroku Morohashi, the chairman of Mitsubishi, said that despite the differences in management philosophy and corporate culture, relations between the two companies 'would deepen'. The projects are aimed at consolidating Daimler-Benz's strategy of gaining a foothold in Japan and south-east Asia. They are also designed to strengthen the competitiveness of Mitsubishi. Projects range from environmental and recycling licence agreements and joint ventures to distribution and marketing of Daimler-Benz products. They include: Metallurgical recycling process. A joint venture between Mercedes Benz and Austrian Industries will take responsibility for technology transfer and development, while Mitsubishi will market the process in Japan and throughout the Asian market. The process replaces the conventional method of shredding used cars. Car industry. A subsidiary of Mercedes-Benz will assemble, distribute and market the Mitsubishi L200 pick-up truck in South Africa. Electronics. Mitsubishi Electric will supply Temic Telefunken microelectronic, a subsidiary of Daimler-Benz, with technology required for the manufacture of semi-conductors for cars. Plastics. Both companies will conduct a one-year feasibility study on the recycling of waste plastics, with emphasis on cars, aircraft and electric appliances. A Daimler-Benz official said yesterday's agreements were expected to be enhanced.</p>

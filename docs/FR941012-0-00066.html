			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Clause (e)(1)(ii) should allow exceptions to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wearing of leg protectors for all circumstances (not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> just climbers) in which there is a greater hazard than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> working without them (for instance, fatigue from heat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and humidity or loss of mobility in heavy undergrowth  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> etc.). It would be even more appropriate if the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wearing of ``leg protectors'' were made optional,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> depending on the individual work circumstances. One  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> study, (The Role of Personal Protection in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Prevention of Accidental Injuries in Logging Work, T.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Klen and S. Vayrynen, Journal of Occupational  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accidents, 1984) concluded that personal protectors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have not been very effective and that this was a result  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of a phenomena known as ``risk compensation'', the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tendency of workers to be more careless when they  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believe that personal protectors will prevent injury  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Ex. 5&hyph;59).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OSHA has carefully reviewed the record on this issue  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and, for several reasons, has decided in the final rule to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> retain the requirement that leg protection cover the upper  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> thigh to the boot top. The record clearly shows that chain-saw operators face a significant risk of injury due to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> kickback. The WIR survey indicates that 64 percent of all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chain-saw injuries reported were the result of kickback (Ex.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2&hyph;1). Further, the WIR survey shows that almost 30 percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of all injured employees were not wearing leg protection at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the time. Also, almost one-fourth of all injuries reported  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were to the leg.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> According to the Maine BLS survey, chain-saw accidents  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accounted for 26 percent of all reported injuries and more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than half of those accidents involved chain-saw kickback.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA does not believe the record supports the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters' claims that chain-saw injuries only occur to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> area around the knee. Injuries to the lower leg as well as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the knee are significant. The WIR survey indicated that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nine percent of all employees reporting injuries were hurt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the lower leg or ankle, while 11 percent were injured in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the knee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The available accident and injury data also do not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> support the commenters' argument that lack of mobility is a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> greater hazard to chain-saw operators than lack of leg  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protection. To the contrary, the data clearly show that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> risk of chain-saw kickback is far more serious than any of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the potential dangers that have been suggested with regard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to leg protection (Ex. 2&hyph;1). For example, according to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> WIR survey, none of the chain-saw operators said they had  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been injured because they did not have enough time to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> retreat from the falling tree. On the other hand, almost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> two-thirds of the chain-saw operators were injured because  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the chain saw kicked back. In any event, OSHA believes that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other provisions in the proposed and final rule will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adequately address concerns about mobility. For example,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the requirement to plan and clear retreat paths before  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commencing cutting will protect employees who would be at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> risk from decreased mobility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, OSHA believes the new innovations in leg  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protection technology address the commenters' concerns about  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> costs, mobility, fatigue and heat stress. First, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> record shows that full-leg protection now being manufactured  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is light-weight and relatively cool (Ex. 5&hyph;68, 9&hyph;4). The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> record also shows that light-weight leg protection that is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inserted or sewn into logging pants is now available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> According to one commenter, these new innovations make leg  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protection tolerable even in the hot and humid southern  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> logging regions. OSHA believes these innovations will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduce fatigue and heat stress and will prevent mobility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from being impeded. Second, the record shows that foot  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coverings are available that can supplement protection in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those instances where leg protection may not fully cover the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> logger's lower leg. These devices will provide adequate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protection in those isolated instances where leg protection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may not be long enough without requiring the employer to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purchase leg protection in many different sizes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 4. First aid. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The hearing notice raised two issues  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> about first aid: the number of employees who must have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> first-aid training, and the elements required as part of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that training, such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> a. Number of employees trained. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The proposed standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specified that all supervisors and all fellers be adequately  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> trained in first aid methods as prescribed by the American  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Red Cross, the Mine Safety and Health Administration or an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equivalent training program. In addition, the proposed rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> included a provision that at least one person in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``operating area'' have first-aid training.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / The ERM - Picking up the Pieces: Same rules but easier to play WIDENING the currency bands to 15 per cent for all except the D-Mark and the guilder makes it much less demanding to be a member of the ERM. But the basic rules of the system are otherwise the same. It is a 'parity grid system', meaning each currency can only fluctuate a certain amount from a fixed 'par value' with regard to every other member currency. In the revamped mechanism, all the par values are unchanged, but these rates will be a lot less relevant now that currencies can oscillate so widely. Before last weekend, a currency's maximum deviation from its par value was only plus or minus 2.25 per cent, except for the Spanish peseta and the Portuguese escudo, which could move 6 per cent either way. With 15 per cent bands, a currency could be theoretically devalued by 30 per cent - from its ceiling to its floor - against another member without falling out of the system. A look at the new floor and ceiling values for each member currency shows the impact of the broader bands. The French franc can now fall as low as FFr3.8948 against the D-Mark, or rise as high as FFr2.8881, before endangering its position in the ERM grid. Until yesterday morning, the franc's floor and ceiling against the D-Mark since 1987 had been FFr3.4305 and FFr3.2792, respectively. According to the ERM's rules, whenever a currency is at its floor against another member, the central banks of both countries have to intervene to prevent the currency from falling out of the system. In practice, the monetary authorities used to prop up a weak currency well before then. Even so, many economists doubt that the situation will arise very often while the wider fluctuation bands are in place.</p>

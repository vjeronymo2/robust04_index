			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Spanish Defense Minister Julian Garcia Vargas  believes that the allied attack on aircraft of the former  Yugoslavia does not place the Spanish blue helmets in particular  danger, because more tense situations have been experienced,  such as the one last week when the Western ultimatum expired.    In statements in the Congress lobby prior to reporting to a  closed session on the operational situation of the Armed Forces,  the minister explained that it is still not known to which force  the downed aircraft belonged because noone is owning up to it.  For this reason, an increase in tension is not expected.    Garcia Vargas considers that, in a sense, the attack was  expected because it has always been thought, he said, that the  violation of the air exclusion zone should elicit a response.  Yesterday saw the materialization of a possibility that had  always existed.    He also referred to the possibility of mortar attacks on  Sarajevo. If this shelling is continuous, he said, there will  be a NATO attack.</p>

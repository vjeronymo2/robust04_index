			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, May 10 (BTA) -- "This is a very important  visit. It is at a good level and it is important to keep our  relations at this level at least. There are a lot of problems  of mutual interest which we can resolve together," Lieutenant  General Janos Deak, commander of the Hungarian Army and General  Staff Chief, told BTA. Gen. Deak is leading a Hungarian military  delegation on a two-day visit to Bulgaria paid under the  Bulgarian-Hungarian programme for cooperation in the military  field.    The programme for military cooperation between Bulgaria and  Hungary should be expanded, Army General Lyuben Petrov, chief of  the General Staff of the Bulgarian Army, and Gen. Janos Deak  agreed at their meeting today. "The consensus of the Hungarian  Parliament on the Army Act adopted in 1993 has opened a  possibility for the active restructuring of the armed forces in  that country and Bulgaria can learn a lot from Hungary's  experience in this respect," Gen. Petrov told BTA. It is planned  to expand joint activities mainly in the exchange of information  and experience in carrying out the reform and restructuring of  the armed forces and in providing supplies for the armies under  the conditions of a market economy. According to Gen. Petrov,  it is the sides' shared opinion that the Balkans are an area  arousing concern among the European and the regional  communities. Bulgarian-Hungarian military cooperation was also  discussed at the meeting which the Hungarian guest had with  Deputy Minister of Defence Grigor Khandzhiev.    The problems of relations between the military and civil  army  leaderships were considered at the meeting of Gen. Deak and  Parliamentary National Security Committee Chairman Nikolay  Slatinski. The sides exchanged experience on the legislative  solution to army problems. "The Bulgarian Parliament may not  pass the defence and armed forces legislation because many keep  talking about early elections, and it will take another two  months to finalize the bill," BTA was told by Mr. Slatinski. He  shared his positive impression from the pragmatic approach  applied by the Hungarian Defence Ministry in resolving the  economic problems under the conditions of transition to a market  economy. "As NATO's Partnership for Peace plan is still at a  stage of political solutions, it has no&amp; been discussed in  detail," the Bulgarian parliamentarian said. He stressed that  integration within Europe should not be achieved at the expense  of the Central and East European countries' bilateral relations.  "A kind of 'rivalry' observed at international forums gives rise  to prejudice in this respect sometimes," Mr. Slatinski said.  "Defence Minister Valentin Aleksandrov's idea of expanding  military contacts among the Danubian countries has not become  state policy yet," he stated. Mr. Slatinksi believes that the  idea was developed by the political scientist, diplomat and  historian Valentin Aleksandrov rather than Valentin Aleksandrov  the defence minister.    The idea of expanding the Danubian countries' military  contacts was discussed by Defence Minister Aleksandrov and his  Hungarian counterpart Lajos Fur in Sofia in March 1993. At the  time the two defence ministers confirmed the sides' shared  desire for the promotion of bilateral military cooperation at  all levels. A joint declaration was signed on the advancement  of military ties in the spirit of the cooperation agreement  concluded between the Bulgarian and Hungarian Defence Ministries  in Sofia in 1991. The agreement built on the political  declaration on bilateral relations which President Zhelyu Zhelev  of Bulgaria and President Arpad Goncz of Hungary had signed in  Budapest the previous month. The agreement is an expression of  the desire for cooperation based on mutual respect and aimed at  confidence building, which would help establish an European  collective security system. It makes provisions for  coordination of the activity of the two countries' Defence  Ministries in the implementation of the United Nations  resolutions concerning peacekeeping and of their activity within  the framework of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in  Europe process. The bilateral documents map out the fields of  future joint work on the problems of security policies,  development of the armies and their staff structure,  modernization in the military and technological field, defence  economy and financial support of the armies, etc.</p>

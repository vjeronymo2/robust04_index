			<p><P> June 10, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TO HIM, IT DOESN'T MEAN A THING IF IT'S NOT SWING;  </P> <P> RADIO VETERAN JON HOLIDAY BELIEVES THAT BIG BANDS CAN KEEP WINNING FANS, AND  HE'S PROVING IT WITH A NATIONALLY SYNDICATED SHOW.  </P> <P> "Big Band Swing -- the Hit Music of the 1990s!" Say what? Believe it. That's an  actual headline from Fortune Magazine's "Trendspotter's to the Tastes of the  1990s."  </P> <P> Of course, predicting something doesn't make it happen, and this particular  report from the old crystal ball might seem like especially wishful thinking.  But it came as good news -- "real confirmation of what I believe in" -- to  radio veteran Jon Holiday of San Clemente.  </P> <P> Actually, the headline is far from the only thing that Holiday finds  encouraging. All he has to do is check the Arbitron ratings for "Swing Era II,"  his nationally syndicated radio show. It's been battering the "adult  contemporary" and "modern country" categories in some of the larger markets.  </P> <P> Holiday says the show, which presents a blend of classic and contemporary  swing, is the only one of its kind in syndication -- it's produced in stereo  specifically for FM.  </P> <P> "I've always felt that swing was due for a comeback," Holiday says. "Hell, I  wasn't convinced it had ever really gone away. It was just being ignored by  most radio programmers -- even though new swing records are being recorded  every day." He cites Linda Ronstadt and the Manhattan Transfer as two such  artists, along with lesser-known lights such as the Spitfire Band from Canada  and Bill Tole's Orchestra from Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "The problem," Holiday says, "is that even with all the research they have  available, a lot of people in the industry don't seem to know much about their  audiences. They hang out with other radio people and they don't get out into  the field to find out what their listeners want to hear." Among the  disbelievers are programmers in Orange County, who won't give the hometown  hero's show a slot.  </P> <P> If his track record is any indication, though, Holiday knows just what his  listeners want to hear. The most recent Arbitron numbers for Cleveland, for  example, list his four-hour show, known there as "Big Band Saturday Night," as  the top-rated radio program among people 35 to 64 years old. Figures for other  cities -- Philadelphia, Washington, Jacksonville and San Antonio among them --  show similarly impressive results.  </P> <P> What really makes Holiday gloat, though is that "in Philadelphia, we're getting  500 listeners per quarter hour in the 12- to 17-year-old demographics!"  </P> <P> "All the radio guys think kids don't like swing. But the truth is that kids do  like it -- when they get a chance to hear it."  </P> <P> Holiday's primary strategy for reaching "the kids" is to steer clear of  nostalgia. "I don't, and I won't, program nostalgia," he declares. "I program  swing music." The difference, he says, is that nostalgia is "designed to appeal  to listeners who wish to be vicariously transported to the past," whereas swing  music reaches out to listeners who are interested in "interpretation,  improvisation, musical value and quality of composition.  </P> <P> "The love of swing," Holiday asserts, "crosses all demographic lines. (It's)  uninhibited by the age of the listener."  </P> <P> About 25% of the music Holiday plays "is from the '30s and '40s -- Glenn  Miller, Benny Goodman, and so forth," he says. "Fifty percent is from the '50s  through the '70s -- Billy May, Ray Anthony, Frank Sinatra and Jo Stafford. And  25% is music recorded in the '80s." (See box, next page.)  </P> <P> Holiday, 69, is tall and craggy-looking and has the deceptively laid-back style  of a cracker barrel philosopher. But he has the drive and determination of a  man at least 10 years younger. His resume lists jobs at 14 radio stations in 10  states stretching from Georgia to Washington.  </P> <P> Holiday, who was born in New Jersey, began playing the clarinet in 1935 after  he heard a radio broadcast by the Benny Goodman band. "I couldn't believe what  I heard," he recalled. "Nobody could play like that. So I got really serious  with the instrument.  </P> <P> "By the time I was 14, I had a gig in a tavern, playing four hours a night for  a buck an hour. May not sound like much now, but in 1935 that was pretty good  pay. You could buy a hamburger for a dime and a Coke for a nickel. And they  were real hamburgers."  </P> <P> Holiday joined the Navy a year before World War II started. He managed to spend  much of his shore leaves in New York City, following the multitude of big bands  appearing there. But all that changed on Dec. 7, 1941.  </P> <P> "After the war started, I spent four years, one month and three days outside  the continental limits of the United States. Had two ships torpedoed under me,  one of them sunk. I was awarded 12 battle stars. But I sure didn't hear a lot  of music."  </P> <P> When the war was over, Holiday was in Atlanta, uncertain whether to continue a  music career. "I ran into two guys who'd been on the scene and asked them what  was happening. One of them pulled out a record by an alto saxophone player,  knowing that was my instrument. Well, I was just blown away. The next day I  went out and sold my horn. The sax player was Charlie Parker."  </P> <P> Holiday enrolled at the University of Georgia, majoring in journalism and  music, and he soon was working at the Athens radio station WGAU.  </P> <P> "That was the start of my radio career. From then on, as we used to say in the  Navy, I never unpacked my sea bag. I worked in Athens, Ga., and Rockfield, S.C.  -- which is a wide place in the road. I worked in Charlotte three or four  different times, as well as Greensboro, Winston-Salem and Raleigh. I was in  Little Rock, Ark., for five years, then Kansas City, El Paso, Spokane, Seattle  and L.A. I guess I've pretty much covered the map."  </P> <P> Late in 1983, Holiday suffered a severe heart attack. A triple bypass operation  and long recuperation followed. "By the time I was ready to go back to work, my  job was gone. And few radio stations are in love with the idea of employing  program directors who are over the age of 60."  </P> <P> Forced, then, to work as an independent, he founded Holiday Broadcasting and  developed the "Swing Era II" syndication format. By the mid-'80s, it was  established well enough to spin off a swing-oriented newsletter.  </P> <P> Holiday's one real regret, he says, is that he has not been able to place the  show on an Orange County station. "Oh, I've tried all right. But they've got  their minds made up that what they're already doing is good enough.  </P> <P> "I talked to one local station about a Saturday night swing program -- that's  when it's done best across the country -- and they said they were content to  cover horse races in that time slot." He shakes his head in disbelief.  </P> <P> But his characteristic enthusiasm for all matters relating to swing soon  overcomes his incredulity.  </P> <P> "You know what I'd really like to see? Big band radio remotes, like the kind of  broadcasts we used to get from all those famous ballrooms: the Glen Island  Casino, the Steel Pier, Meadowbrook, the Palladium.  </P> <P> "And it could be done, too," Holiday continues, his voice brightening with  fervor. "Disneyland has bands working every weekend. You could easily do a live  broadcast from there, and I'll bet you anything it would get better ratings  than some of the sound-alike programming you hear on FM every night."  </P> <P> Holiday pauses for a moment, a wry smile on his face.  </P> <P> "Look, I'm well aware of the fact that I may be a dinosaur. I may be the last  of a breed, trying to make this programming work. But I'm convinced that  there're an awful lot of folks out there, maybe some of whom don't speak up  quite often enough, who agree with me. So I'm going to hang in there and keep  trying to make a case for swing music.  </P> <P> "What the hell. Nobody ever said life was easy. And I'm too damn mean to die  anyhow. When it gets right down to it, my final ambition is to keep on  programming swing music -- and then get shot dead by a jealous husband when I'm  99."  </P></p>

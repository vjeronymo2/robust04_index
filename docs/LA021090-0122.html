			<p><P> February 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOCKOUT EMITS WINTRY CHILL;  </P> <P> SPRING TRAINING: IT COULD MEAN ECONOMIC DISASTER FOR SOME SUN BELT TOWNS,  BUSINESSES DEPENDENT ON CAMPS.  </P> <P> While white-shirted executives sit in stale meeting rooms and argue over  methods to make ballplayers millionaires, the thoughts of a grocer in Dunedin,  Fla., and a hotel operator in Mesa, Ariz., are elsewhere. They are more  concerned with the economic impact of a spring training lockout that could keep  them from realizing their economic dreams.  </P> <P> Barring a late settlement, baseball's spring training camps will not open next  week. And that translates to a loss of income for many businesses that bank on  the six-week spring training period.  </P> <P> Contrary to recent published reports, however, Florida officials are not  estimating a $300-million loss to the state's economy if there is a lockout.  </P> <P> That figure represents the financial influx spring training added to the  state's economy in 1987, according to a study. Officials agree there will be a  financial impact, but are uncertain how bad it will be.  </P> <P> Of the 26 major league teams, 18 train in Florida. Still, Floridians boast  their state has more to offer tourists than spring baseball. They hope that  revenue normally generated by spring training will be diverted into other  activities.  </P> <P> "We have 37 million visitors a year in Florida, and a good third of them come  through in February and March," said Ron Safford, director of sports promotion  for the state.  </P> <P> "For the sports enthusiast, even though spring training may not occur, there is  plenty down here to do and see, and it may actually open some eyes to the value  of some of these other sports. We are trying to look on the bright side of  this."  </P> <P> Studies indicate that although 63% of Florida's tourists are influenced to  visit the state because of spring training, only 7% of those who stay in hotels  attend it.  </P> <P> Snowbirds, as those who head to warmer climates in the winter months are called  by Arizona and Florida residents, make reservations months in advance for  extended stays during Florida's peak season of February and March.  </P> <P> A good example of that is in Vero Beach, where the Dodgers train. The Chamber  of Commerce says hotels report solid bookings through March, and reservations  are not contingent on spring training.  </P> <P> "In Vero Beach, $20-25 million is generated each spring training," said J. B.  Norton, executive vice president of the Vero Beach chamber of commerce.  </P> <P> "The loss to us if the Dodgers aren't here is about $5 million. The tourists  are going to be here anyway. The major loss is going to be in the rentals of  homes and condos by the Dodger players, at the restaurants and car rental  agencies. Also, there are many people who live in the state who love the  Dodgers and drive over for the day."  </P> <P> The Ocean Grill in Vero Beach expects to lose 30 to 50 dinners a night without  spring training. The restaurant says the loss of business will be primarily  Dodger personnel.  </P> <P> "I would say, and I have nothing to back this up, but about 15% of our winter  visitors come to Vero Beach specifically for spring training," Norton said. "We  are a resort state, so people are going to be here anyway. The hotels were full  in Port St. Lucie before the New York Mets moved there two years ago. And  beginning the latter part of this month, it will be difficult to find a room."  </P> <P> Dodger players who normally bring their families to Vero Beach might have a  problem finding housing, should the lockout suddenly end. Dodgertown, the  team's spring training facility, houses players only.  </P> <P> The optimism, however, can't override reality for many Florida businesses. The  Days Inn in Vero Beach estimates a loss of $12,000 without spring training.  </P> <P> And in Dunedin, Fla., where the Toronto Blue Jays train, a new $2.5-million  stadium will be ready March 2. But without the Blue Jays, the annual payment of  $300,000 on the park will be tough for the city to make. Dunedin's population  is 35,000.  </P> <P> "We are not desperate, but it's not good," said Cecil Englebert, who was  instrumental in bringing the Blue Jays to Dunedin. "The tourists are still  going to be here, but they are going to spend money somewhere else in the state  and not locally. At Disney World or someplace. But not from the local grocer."  </P> <P> There is less reason for optimism in Arizona. The state's economy is suffering  from a severe real estate slowdown and banking collapse. Property values have  plunged, and foreclosures are widespread.  </P> <P> Arizona counts on spring training to generate nearly $160 million. Although  studies show a relatively small group of tourists visit Florida specifically  for spring training, baseball is the primary draw for tourists at most southern  Arizona sites at this time of year.  </P> <P> Of the seven Arizona cities that play host to major league teams, only three  are bona fide vacation resorts -- Scottsdale, Phoenix and Tucson. Rarely do  people plan to vacation in Mesa, Yuma, Tempe or Chandler.  </P> <P> But camp operators in at least two cities, Mesa and Tempe, have reportedly  taken out lockout insurance policies with Lloyd's of London. And it is believed  that Chandler and Scottsdale have also taken out policies, but camp operators  would not confirm it.  </P> <P> Sources say that the HoHoKam organization, which runs the Chicago Cubs' camp in  Mesa, has bought a policy that would cover payments on a recent $400,000  improvement of the stadium. They said that the policy also will cover basic  operating expenses and be paid on a pro-rated basis during any lockout.  </P> <P> But there is no insurance for the Mesa economy. Besides the Cubs, the Angels  and Milwaukee Brewers stay in Mesa hotels. The Brewers play their games in  nearby Chandler, and the Angels begin spring training in Mesa and then move  their camp to Palm Springs in mid-March.  </P> <P> Studies indicate that the Cubs alone add $37.5 million to the Mesa economy, and  the Angels generate another $15.5. Combined, the teams spend nearly $2 million.  </P> <P> "We count on March to get us through the rest of the year, so I would say it  would be quite disastrous if there is no spring training," said Deidra Draper,  general manager of the Mazona Motor Hotel, where the Cubs stay.  </P> <P> "Tours from Chicago have already expressed concern in sending their deposits,  and the first tour is not scheduled to arrive until March 3, so if they cancel  72 hours in advance we will issue refunds. I would say we would lose about  $150,000 if there is no spring training."  </P> <P> Also hard hit will be Mesa's Boys and Girls Club, whose concession business at  three parks accounted for $500,000, or half of its annual operating income last  season.  </P> <P> And many of Arizona's charities, which derive income from ballpark concessions  and parking, would suffer.  </P> <P> "I guess I have a vacation now," said Rick (the Peanut Man) Kaminski, who has  worked as a vendor for the Boys and Girls Club for three years.  </P> <P> "We get 25 cents for each item we sell, so individually I will lose about  $2,500 to $3,000 for the one-month period when the games are played."  </P> <P> Cub announcers Steve Stone and Harry Caray are co-owners of restaurants in  Mesa, about five minutes from the Cubs' ballpark, and in Scottsdale. Stone  anticipates a major plunge in business in Mesa and a loss of about 25% in  Scottsdale.  </P> <P> "The hotels in Scottsdale are booked because people have to make their  reservations in advance, regardless," Stone said.  </P> <P> "But if there is no spring training, will the people still come? They might.  Will they go to the same haunts they would have gone to if the baseball players  were here? I doubt it."  </P> <P> Officials in Palm Springs, where the Angels spend the last two weeks of spring  training, estimate the team generates about $3 million for the city. But Palm  Springs officials look at spring training as merely one of many tourist  attractions.  </P> <P> Florida, Arizona and Palm Springs also stand to lose in a way that can't be  measured in dollars.  </P> <P> Said Florida's Safford: "We know for a fact that folks in Boston, when they are  snowbound in their apartment or they come home and have that warm cup of cocoa  and sit down in front of the evening news, and they see film footage from  Florida of their team -- people in short sleeves in Florida participating  outdoors in warm weather -- they know that spring is coming. And in a month,  their team is coming up with a new season, a clean record, a chance to win the  pennant, they say, 'This is the year for us!'  </P> <P> "That warm sense they get is the best public relations you can ever have for a  state, and that will be somewhat lost if we don't have spring training. That's  our major loss."  </P> <P> Baseball lore has it that long ago, Dodger management, in an effort to  determine the impact the team's presence had on Vero Beach, decided to conduct  a study.  </P> <P> They paid their ballplayers in $2 bills, then waited to see where the bills  turned up. Soon, the story goes, every merchant in town had registers  overflowing with $2 bills.  </P> <P> That's not likely to happen this year.  </P></p>

			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Security lures first-time buyers Sir, As a future first-time buyer I noted with great interest the article on the long-term view of the housing market ('The long view' October 9). I agree that a home is not a prime money-making asset in today's climate but I do not agree that there will necessarily be a shortage of first-time buyers in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The reason that I will buy into the housing market in a few years' time is because I feel that owning a house will give me far greater security in later life than renting a house. With this in mind I feel that the market for first-time buyers will continue to prosper under a much 'wiser' generation. Kaylene Eastwood, Newbold College, Binfield, Bracknell, Berkshire RG12 5AN</p>

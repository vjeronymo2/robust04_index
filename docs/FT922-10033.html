			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / Survey of Danish Shipping and Shipbuilding (2): Loans work better than subsidies - A financing system that keeps the industry afloat INSTEAD OF resorting to cash hand-outs, Denmark has chosen an innovative form of ship financing to keep its shipbuilding industry afloat. For, unlike their European counterparts, Danish shipyards do not receive direct cash subsidies. 'We believe that we have the best system. In contrast to Sweden and Germany, where funds were pumped directly into the yards, which gave them no incentive to become more efficient, our system supports the shipping companies and not the yards. So Danish yards have been compelled to improve,' explains Mr Stig Kaare Lyngsie, senior vice-president of Danmarks Skibskreditfond (DSF). The Danish system is on offer to shipping companies of any nationality wanting to build new ships at Danish shipyards. It works through a combination of indexed loans, carrying a maximum rate of interest of 5.5 per cent all told, and OECD loans at 8 per cent over eight and half years. DSF provides financing of up to 80 per cent of the contract price, which often is arranged through a partnership financing system that provides hard-pressed Danish taxpayers with a tax break. For the indexed loans the owner can choose either a rate of interest of 2.5 per cent with an indexation of a maximum 3 per cent per annum or a rate of interest of 4 per cent with an indexation of a maximum 1.5 per cent per annum. The indexed and OECD loans are funded by bonds issued by DSF and sold on the Copenhagen Stock Exchange. Government support enters into the picture more in the form of a guarantee than an immediate subsidy. The government promises to make up any difference between the indexation of the loan and the bond. This means that in periods of low inflation, which the Danish economy has enjoyed for the last three years, the government pays almost nothing in this guaranteed subsidy. 'We are very safe,' explains Mr Per Schnack, DSF treasurer, 'because our capital adequacy requirements are high at 10 per cent compared with the mortgage credit institutions which need 8 per cent. Last year we were actually at 27 per cent.' DSF finances nearly all commercial ship building in Denmark. Today the fund has a portfolio of 500 ships or about 0.75 per cent of the world shipping fleet. 'We are one of the largest pure ship financing organisations in the world,' says Mr Lyngsie. The fund is secured by guarantee capital of DKr300m provided by the Danish central bank and members of the Danish Bankers' Association, the Danish Shipowners' Association, the Association of Danish Shipbuilders and the Danish insurance association. The subsidy element in a ship built at a Danish yard varies with the financing system used and the date of delivery of vessels on order. If index loans only together with OECD loans are used to finance up to 80 per cent of the contract price, - the maximum permitted under international agreements - then the subsidy element may be as low as 2.2 per cent on ships for delivery in 1994. That would depend, however, on the rate of inflation and market rates of interest. If partnership financing is used together with the other financing forms, the subsidy element would then rise to the maximum 9 per cent of the contract price as permitted by the EC at present. The partnership system (similar to the widespread Norwegian one known as the k/s or kommandit system) is the most frequently used financing system where a group of small investors provides the financing for a project. Investors buy or help finance the building of a ship and are then paid via a bare boat charter party of the vessel. Because of the large number of investors - it can be 5,000 or more for a single project - the partnership schemes have been able to finance major shipping projects. But the real attraction for investors has been a deferred payment of tax because of the special status of these partnership systems rather than profit made directly from the investment. Rules to cut back the tax benefits of the schemes have gradually been introduced by the Danish parliament which has been increasingly concerned that the tax break was too generous. According to OECD calculations the system is also equivalent to a subsidy of 5 to 6 per cent. That has proved enough for Denmark's politicians to take the plunge and put an end to this type of financing. Now, new partnership schemes can only be set up for the building of new ships in Danish yards which must be delivered before the end of 1995. By 1995 government subsidised loans such as those made by DSF and the partnership schemes will have disappeared. DSF is sanguine about its future. 'There is massive need for financing all over Europe because of the age of the shipping fleets and we have already seen great interest in our market loans,' says Mr Lyngsie. The only mourners of the passing of shipping subsidies in Denmark will be the Danish taxpayers.</p>

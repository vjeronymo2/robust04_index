			<p><P> February 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: SANDERS SHOULD JOIN THE NFL, FATHER SAYS  </P> <P> The father of Barry Sanders, Oklahoma State's Heisman Trophy winner, said that  his son should forgo his senior year at Oklahoma State, which is under National  Collegiate Athletic Assn. sanction, and try his luck in the National Football  League.  </P> <P> "If he won the Heisman Trophy again this year, he couldn't get any more money  or market himself any more than they are already," William Sanders said.  </P> <P> Barry Sanders said in early January, when a four-year probation for Oklahoma  State's football program was announced, that he would return for his senior  season with the Cowboys.  </P> <P> On Sunday, Sanders said he has made a decision but wouldn't say what it is.  </P> <P> The Dallas Morning News reported Sunday, however, that Sanders, a junior, told  one NFL team that he will definitely turn professional. Since Sanders has never  redshirted, he would not be eligible for the regular NFL draft this spring  unless he decides to challenge it in the courts. He could, however, apply for  the summer supplemental draft.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Buenos Aires, 15 Apr (NA) -- The Argentine  Association of Newspaper Owners (ADEPA) today warned that "the  main problem facing journalists in Argentina is: the threat that  an eventual law excessively increasing penalties for slander  might be left at the disposal of officials wanting to silence  reports on corruption, which have regularly involved Argentine  public figures."    The institution's concern is included in a report issued by  the Freedom of the Press and Information Commission presided  over by Jose Claudio Escribano that was unanimously approved  during the deliberations of the 94th ADEPA semi-annual board of  directors meeting that ended today.    The editors also unanimously and categorically rejected the  "ethic tribunals imposed or suggested from the highest  government levels. We reiterate that no journalism is possible  without solid moral bases and the implacable daily judgment  passed by readers and clients who do not hesitate to be  categorical."    The report also discusses "the confusion over the meaning of  journalistic criticism, the theory of real malice, Santiago del  Estero's inadmissible situation in the distribution and sale of  newspapers, the figure of the ombudsman, so-called contempt of  court, and the investigation of attacks against journalists,"  among other things.    ADEPA recognized that "independent journalists are not  necessarily against governments, but neither will they place  themselves at their service, for they serve society."    ADEPA's board of directors started their meeting on 14  April.  On that occasion President Guillermo Ignacio offered his report  and gave details on ADEPA activities since the Salta assembly in  September 1993.    Ignacio's report includes details of his meetings with  President Carlos Menem in October 1993 and January 1994.    He also referred to meetings with special fiscal prosecutor  Luis Gonzalez Warcalde to learn about the progress of  investigations into the attacks against journalists. The report  gave details on steps taken with the Brazilian Newspaper  Association to invite other Latin American press associations to  form an association to represent them. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Polish Union of the Democratic Left Chairman </F> Aleksander Kwasniewski by Pavol Minarik in Warsaw; date not  given: "Can the Left Establish Capitalism?"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Minarik] What is your view  on cooperation among the Visegrad Four countries?    [Kwasniewski] I am convinced that mutual cooperation will  not weaken our countries, but will enhance their domestic and  international status. Therefore, I do not consider the course  of action being followed by Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus, who is  trying to incorporate Bohemia into a united Europe behind the  backs of the Visegrad Group, to be a very fortunate one. I  think our position will be better if we proceed together. A  race to see who will be first, for example, in the European  Union, will not speed up this incorporation process, rather it  will slow it down. Apart from this, I think it would be  beneficial to intensify economic cooperation in the region, for  example, by establishing free trade zones or by adopting a joint  course of action to acquire or restore markets, first and  foremost, in the East.    [Minarik] Developing a security system in Central Europe  should also be one of the main areas of cooperation among the  Visegrad Four.    [Kwasniewski] I am absolutely in favor of us coordinating  our steps for entry into security structures, including NATO,  because we all face the same problems. First and foremost, we  have to convince the West to open up to us, but, on the other  hand, we cannot turn our relations with Russia and Ukraine into  antagonistic ones.    [Minarik] Are you worried by the victory of [Liberal  Democratic Party] V. Zhirinovskiy in the Russian elections,  especially by his controversial statements about Poland?    [Kwasniewski] Zhirinovskiy's victory was remarkable, but the  question still is what kind of influence will he have in Russia.  The fundamental issue is how will the man who wields real power  in the country behave, that is, Boris Yeltsin, who is  responsible for the new constitution. It is crucial whether he  embarks upon a policy of strengthening the democratic processes  and becoming involved in security systems or whether  Zhirinovskiy will scare him and he embarks upon a policy of  nationalism and restoring power-wielding whims. I think,  however, that Boris Yeltsin realizes that Russia needs to  cooperate with the West and Europe and that he will also direct  his steps toward this end. [passage omitted]</p>

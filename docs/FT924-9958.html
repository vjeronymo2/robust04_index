			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / International Company News: Turkey offers 20% stake in Netas THE TURKISH Government is offering to sell its 20 per cent share in Netas, the local subsidiary of Northern Telecom of Canada, plus stakes in four other companies in an attempt to revive its flagging privatisation programme. The five companies are expected to raise TL641bn (Dollars 85.3m). Bids have to be submitted by December 1. The Public Participation Administration, which handles the sale of state assets to the public, plans to make sales worth TL5,500 in 1992, including the sale of 11 state cement companies. Bids for these are closed. Netas, listed on the Istanbul stock exchange, is Turkey's second-largest telecommunications manufacturer and has recently concluded a deal to supply digital switches to Azerbaijan. The company said yesterday Northern Telcom, which owns 51 per cent, was expected to make an offer for the government stake. A balancing 29 per cent stake owned by the PPA is to be sold by public offering to local investors before the new year. PPA's 18 per cent stake in Teletas, another telecommunications manufacturer, is to go on sale this month, after talks with Alcatel, its French majority partner broke down.</p>

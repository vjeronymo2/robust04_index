			<p><P> June 14, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> OXNARD STARTS HEARINGS OVER TROUBLED BUDGET  </P> <P> The Oxnard City Council has begun hearings on how to deal with the city budget  crisis, but officials said they won't make final decisions until they see the  results of a management audit next week.  </P> <P> The council is discussing how to avoid a projected $2.8-million budget deficit  next year. The hearings started Tuesday and continued into Wednesday night.  </P> <P> "I don't think there is anyone looking forward to the next few days," City  Manager David Mora said at the outset on Tuesday.  </P> <P> He said the city must consider service reductions and as many as 64 personnel  cuts, including 16 from the Police Department and 8 from the Fire Department.  </P> <P> The city had hoped to raise $5 million annually with a 5% utility tax increase,  but voters rejected it on June 5 by a 3-to-1 margin.  </P> <P> The management audit was originally due May 30 but was delayed until next week.  It is expected to explain the cause of Oxnard's fiscal crisis and recommend  savings.  </P> <P> Mayor Nao Takasugi has criticized the auditing firm, Cresap Management  Consultants of Washington, for suggesting in private conversations that the  city cut 41 positions in the Police Department, eliminate 18 positions in the  Fire Department, close two fire stations and sell some city parks.  </P> <P> Mora said some personnel cuts are inevitable but revealed several ways in which  the city can lessen the impact.  </P> <P> He said the city can spend part of a $1.4-million rebate from the state-run  public employee retirement program. The rebate was the result of successful  investments made with the city's retirement funds, city officials said.  </P> <P> Mora said the city can avoid immediate layoffs by spending some of the rebate  money to pay employees until they find other jobs or retire.  </P> <P> Councilman Manuel Lopez recommended that the city spend $600,000 of the rebate  to allow staff reductions through attrition and use the balance to reduce the  deficit. Councilwoman Dorothy Maron agreed.  </P> <P> Councilwoman Geraldine (Gerry) Furr suggested that half the rebate go toward  phasing out employees and the other half go to replenish the city's reserve  funds, which have dropped from $9 million to about $4 million.  </P> <P> For the last three years the City Council has dipped into the reserves to avoid  deficits. This year it vowed to leave the reserves untouched.  </P> <P> Mora said the council could also reduce the deficit marginally and avoid  further cuts by putting off a five-year, $3-million project to remove asbestos  from several city buildings.  </P> <P> He said the city has earmarked $457,000 this year to begin the asbestos-removal  project. But Mora said the city should not put off the project. "The asbestos  problem is not going to go away," he said.  </P> <P> In Wednesday's hearing, Takasugi suggested that the city delay the project but  put aside $120,000 toward the cost of removing the asbestos in the future.  </P></p>

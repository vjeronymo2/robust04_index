			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / UK Company News: IIMR gives definition of 'headline' earnings THE INSTITUTE of Investment Management and Research has announced the final definition of the 'headline' earnings calculation it will use in response to changes in accounting standards. The figure will include all trading profits and losses for the company for the year, including interest and abnormal trading items, and those from operations discontinued during the year. Profits or losses on the sale or termination of a discontinued operation and on the sale of fixed assets or of businesses should be excluded. The adoption of the formula follows the introduction of FRS 3, the new financial reporting standard on the profit and loss account, which is now mandatory for British companies. There has been one change since the Institute's draft proposals for a headline figure announced in March this year. Provisions for writing down fixed assets where there has been a permanent diminution in value are excluded from the calculation. So are profits and losses on the sale of fixed assets or complete write-offs. The Financial Times will be adopting the IIMR proposals for its calculation of price/earnings ratios. Extel Financial will also be using the figure as its principal earnings number.</p>

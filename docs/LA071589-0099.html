			<p><P> July 15, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DAIRY CLEARED OF LIABILITY IN 1985 LISTERIOSIS CASES  </P> <P> A Los Angeles Superior Court jury Friday found that Alta-Dena Certified Dairy  will not have to share financial liability for nearly $100 million in unsettled  claims filed by victims of a listeriosis epidemic that killed 48 people and  sickened hundreds of others in 1985.  </P> <P> In an 11-1 verdict reached after 3 1/2 days of deliberations, the jury spurned  arguments by now-defunct Jalisco Mexican Products Inc. of Artesia that raw milk  supplied by Alta-Dena to make cheese was infected with listeria bacteria.  </P> <P> "I feel the Lord has answered our prayers," said Alta-Dena founder Harold  Stueve, 71, in a brief telephone interview. "We had nothing to do with this  case in the first place."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'On Cloud Nine'  </P> <P> Attorney Raymond A. Novell, who represented Alta-Dena in the case, said: "This  was strictly an issue between two companies. Jalisco looked around for deep  pockets and sued us. . . . I'm on cloud nine."  </P> <P> Gary McPherson, former owner of Jalisco, would only say: "We lost. We will  finish settling."  </P> <P> Still, the verdict may have extinguished chances that families of those killed  and children born with birth defects will receive full compensation for their  injuries, said Kim Miller, an attorney for more than 100 plaintiffs who watched  the case from the sidelines.  </P> <P> "I'm surprised that it came out this way. We really believed that the milk  contained the bacteria when it left Alta-Dena," Miller said. Now, she added, "a  lot of the significantly injured plaintiffs will have to take small  compensations. There will not be enough funds to properly compensate these  victims from Jalisco or its insurance proceeds."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Small Insurance Policy'  </P> <P> Miller said the problem is that "Jalisco had a small insurance policy to begin  with -- about $10 million -- almost three-fourths of which has already been  depleted in settlements of claims."  </P> <P> An investigation led by researchers from the federal Centers for Disease  Control in Atlanta counted 142 cases of listeriosis between Jan. 1 and Aug. 15,  1985. The deaths included 20 fetuses, 10 newborns and 18 adults.  </P> <P> McPherson and cheese maker Jose Luis Medina both pleaded no contest in 1986 to  misdemeanor criminal charges. They were sentenced to 30 days and 60 days,  respectively, in Los Angeles County Jail. They were fined a total of about  $48,000.  </P> <P> Throughout the trial, presided over by Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Richard  Lavine, Jalisco attorney Roy Brisbois used expensive models, video  presentations and testimony from medical and food scientists to prove that the  cheese was infected by Alta-Dena's unpasteurized raw milk.  </P> <P> Brisbois' direct evidence of a link between the milk and epidemic, however, was  based largely on the fact that the same strain of bacteria that contaminated  the cheese was found after the outbreak in a carton of Alta-Dena sour cream  taken from a truck at a local dump. The same bacteria turned up in a sample of  caseinate -- which is used to make sour cream -- taken from an Alta-Dena  warehouse.  </P> <P> The same strain of bacteria was also found in body fluid taken from an elderly  man who consumed only Alta-Dena raw milk before he died of cancer in 1982.  While the incident occurred three years before the listeriosis outbreak, health  officials said it constituted direct evidence to back up the discovery of  listeria in the carton of Alta-Dena sour cream.  </P> <P> "The only common link is the milk. . . . It's the only explanation that makes  sense," Brisbois insisted in final remarks to the jury. "I'm asking you to  agree with the best scientific minds in the government that we are right."  </P> <P> But Novell, in his final remarks, called Brisbois' evidence "the three sows'  ears of epidemiology" and blamed the epidemic on "filthy conditions at the  Jalisco plant."  </P> <P> He pointed out that listeria was never detected in milk produced by Alta-Dena's  herds. Between Dec. 1, 1984, and June 30, 1985, Alta-Dena also supplied 26  million gallons of milk to 30 customers. Only Jalisco had a problem, Novell  said. These facts weighed heavily in Alta-Dena's favor during deliberations,  members of the jury said.  </P> <P> Said juror Dina DiBella, 27, of South Gate: "There just wasn't enough evidence  to prove that the milk was contaminated before it got to the Jalisco plant."  </P> <P> With the trial over, Stueve -- who sold Alta-Dena in February to the American  subsidiary of a French firm -- said he and his two brothers plan to devote  their time to producing and distributing Stueve's Natural raw certified milk.  </P></p>

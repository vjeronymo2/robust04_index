			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / Survey of Israel (11): Chocolates on parade - Profile, Elite Foods IN an inner eastern suburb of Tel Aviv, just across a busy road junction from the Israeli diamond exchange, the heavy aroma of chocolate hangs over an otherwise unremarkable factory building, writes HUGH CARNEGY. It is the headquarters of Elite, one of Israel's leading - and oldest - food processors. In a small basement office Mr Nathan Nissani, the chief executive, has plotted the transformation of the company from a confectionery and coffee producer enjoying a virtual monopoly in the Israeli market into an aggressive outfit fighting a tough domestic battle with local competitors in a growing range of products, while at the same time seeking to expand its exports. The past two years have seen some bruising encounters in Israeli supermarkets between Elite and its chief rival, Osem, another long-established company now working hard to expand under the leadership of Mr Dan Propper, a member of one of Osem's founding families. Osem has attacked Elite's overwhelming dominance in coffee. Elite, winning government approval to lower import tariffs, has hit back in Osem's traditional strongholds of pasta and also savoury snacks. The Elite-Osem rivalry is a sign of a slow but significant spreading of competition in Israel's still heavily cartelised food market. Mr Nissani says his steering of Elite into greater local diversity and into exports was a 'deep strategic need' sparked by two factors: the liberalisation of imports of US and European confectionery products and the limited size of the local market. Now he adopts a near military approach to his business. Calling himself a 'hired gun' for his shareholders, he says Israeli managers' army service experience gives them a cutting edge in business. As Elite expands into Europe - including eastern Europe - Mr Nissani sees this combining successfully with Israel's rich pool of emigres. 'One of the big advantages Israel has is the ability to apply the right people in the right places. We also still have the ability to think small - we can adapt quickly.' Elite's direct exports have grown rapidly under Mr Nissani, from Dollars 7m in 1989 to an anticipated Dollars 21m this year out of total sales of Dollars 250m. The target is to achieve Dollars 35m in overseas sales next year. Meanwhile the company, which employs 2,400 people in Israel, has grown in market value from less than Dollars 100m in late 1989 to approaching Dollars 300m today. Apart from direct exports - mainly private confectionery brands for supermarket outlets which Mr Nissani complains bitterly are hampered by EC levies on agricultural ingredients such as milk and sugar - Elite has begun to implement a strategic policy of acquisitions in Europe. It has bought a company called SAF in the St Etienne area of France where Mr Nissani plans to take on all comers. Elite has also purchased the Union Kaffee Group in Germany, a company with Dollars 250m annual turnover with outlets in France, Spain, Belgium and Poland, and owns a company in Poland called Goman. The total sales of these foreign acquisitions now outstrip Elite's Israeli turnover. 'We now have a base in Europe,' says Mr Nissani. 'This will give us sufficient contact with those markets and the ability to understand those markets. We are looking to Russia as well as to Poland. We are now one of the only western companies with a distribution network in Poland.' Elite, however, still has heavy excess capacity at home. One potential to take this up lies in the prospect of Middle East peace. Open borders to Arab countries could be a 'paradise', says Mr Nissani. He says he has begun tentatively to prepare for such a day - as has his rival at Osem. But as in any 'paradise', peace is elusive.</p>

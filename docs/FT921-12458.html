THE WEEK AHEAD The Rank Organisation is expected to report full-year pre-tax profits of Pounds 245m on Thursday, down on last year's Pounds 312.1m. Holidays and bingo are expected to have held up reasonably well, but hotels, casinos and amusement machines are expected to show the wear and tear of recession. Particular attention will focus on the dividend; maintaining last year's final payment of 20.75p would give investors confidence that the group expects to profit from a consumer upturn. The elimination of loss-making businesses is likely to allow W H Smith to post reasonable interim pre-tax profits when it announces its half-year results to December 1 on Wednesday. The City is looking for a figure in the range of Pounds 46m to Pounds 50m, reflecting weakness on the high street but huge savings in interest payments. The interest charge will be down from Pounds 15m to Pounds 5m after a Pounds 148m rights issue in May and the sale of its travel and television interests last year. Book sales, however, were affected by the recession on the high street, which persisted through the Christmas season, while profits from the DIY business are likely to have been dull as well. Growth in the W H Smith book chain is also expected to have been countered by a slightly higher rise in costs. Waterstones, however, has done extremely well, with double digit like-for-like growth.

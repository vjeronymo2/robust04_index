			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, Feb 28 (AFP)--The European Union (EU)  warned China on Monday that any attempt to discriminate against  Britain in trade terms because of the Sino-British row over Hong  Kong would be totally unacceptable and have serious consequences  for EU-China ties.    Sparks flew at a joint press conference given here by EU  Commissioner Leon Brittan and Chinese Foreign Trade Minister Wu  Yi, which was cut short after a heated exchange over the issue  of Hong Kong and Sino-British trade ties.    The press briefing followed the 13th meeting here of the  EU-China Joint Committee, which was co-chaired by Brittan and Wu  and focused on the EU's support for China's re-entry to the  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).    Responding to comments by Wu that Britain's "unfriendly and  uncooperative" stance on Hong Kong would inevitably damage  Sino-British trade ties and economic cooperation, Brittan  stressed that EU-China relations were based on  non-discrimination against separate EU member states. "Any  action that discriminated against one member state on political  grounds would be a very serious matter, not just for that member  state but for the European Union as a whole," Brittan said. He  declined to specify what action the EU might take should China  disrupt trade ties with Britain, but the union's main leverage  on Beijing would appear to be continued support for China's GATT  re-entry.    Wu's suggestion that Brittan, as a British citizen, was  especially concerned with Sino-British ties drew an angry  response from the commissioner, who insisted that the EU's  position would be "identical" in the case of dicrimination  against any other member country. "It would not be acceptable,"  he added. Despite Wu's reply that her comment "was a joke," the  press conference was abruptly cut short.    The question of China's trade ties with Britain was not  actually discussed during the morning talks, but Brittan said he  would certainly be bringing it up in the afternoon.    The briefing began amiably with both sides voicing optimism  after what they described as a "frank and constructive" round of  morning talks. Brittan said the EU was "full of admiration" for  China's efforts to move towards a market economy, but added that  while the EU believed China's re-entry to GATT was in the  interests of the global community, differences on certain  issues still remain. There are problems to resolve because  China's development is of course remarkable but not complete,"  Brittan said, adding that the terms under which China re-enters  the world trade body "have to be negotiated to reflect this and  accelerate the process of refom and liberalisation." Brittan  also said that he expressed European concerns about aspects of  human rights in China. The commissioner had brought a draft  protocol outlining EU proposals on how to resolve outstanding  questions and said he hoped "progress can be made on that  urgently."    For her part, Wu also admitted that differences of opinions  remained, but stressed that both sides were willing to make  efforts to resolve them.    According to a western diplomat here, the EU is concerned  that China will strike a deal with the United States over GATT  membership that would see Beijing making exclusive trading  concessions to Washington at Europe's expense. In an apparent  reference to the United States, Brittan said he had stressed  during the morning talks that the EU's relationship with China  "must be on the fundamental basis of non-discrimination between  the European Union and other powers."    According to Chinese customs statistics, bilateral trade  between the EU and China grew 50 percent last year to 26.1  billion dollars, with China posting a 2.7-billion-dollar  deficit. According to the European Union, however, China enjoys  a growing trade surplus that amounted to 9.93 billion dollars in  1992. EU figures for last year were unavailable.</p>

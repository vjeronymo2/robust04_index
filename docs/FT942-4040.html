			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Markets: Why property shares are the party poopers - Bottom Line After the party, the hangover. Property shares, which produced a glittering return of 89 per cent last year, are now languishing in the doldrums. In the last six months, the sector has fallen by an average of 14 per cent, compared with a 4.5 per cent fall in the market as a whole. At first sight, the reasons for this lacklustre performance are not obvious. The reporting season for big quoted companies, which ended this week, reveals some spectacular results. Land Securities, the sector's largest company, produced a 34 per cent rise in net asset value over the year to end-March, as it reaped the benefit of the remarkable recovery in the property market over the past year. British Land did even better. On Thursday, it announced a 46 per cent rise in its net asset value for the year to end-March. Moreover, most analysts are predicting healthy - albeit more modest - rises in values this year. For instance, British Land's net asset value is tipped to rise from Pounds 4.23 to as much as Pounds 5 this year. Indeed, the weakness of property shares is less due to a serious setback in the sector than from the excessive expectations that had been built into prices. At the start of the year, hopes of rapidly rising property values were reflected in the average 20 per cent premium to net asset values on which shares traded, according to UBS, brokers. Since then, they have sunk to an 8 per cent discount to assets. The waning of investors' enthusiasm for property shares is partly because investors became jaded by a glut of new property companies coming to the market. A more important reason, however, is that the direct property investment market has gone off the boil, as a result of the ailing state of the bond market. Total returns from property actually fell in May, according to Richard Ellis, chartered surveyors. Many commentators think that property share prices will not start to rise again until there is convincing evidence of rental growth in the property market. If bond values suffer another battering, there is a chance that property prices - and the share prices of the quoted companies - will suffer further falls. But even if the big picture for property shares is uninspiring, investors could still do well by careful selection of property shares. In the last six months, some of the best-performing smaller companies have bucked the trend: Shares in Burford Holdings, which yesterday bought London's Trocadero Centre, have risen by 27 per cent in the last six months, while Helical Bar, a developer, has increased by 31 per cent. 'Some of the smaller companies are providing more excitement and interest than the bigger companies,' says Robert Kynoch, of NatWest Securities, brokers. He cites Capital and Regional and Helical Bar as examples of companies with entrepreneurial flair and an ability to ride the cycle. 'If you are a clever entrepreneur, there are very few markets where you can't find value,' says Marc Gilbard, of Goldman Sachs. Of the sector's smaller companies, he favours Helical Bar, Burford, Allied London, Asda Property Holdings, Capital &amp; Regional and Chelsfield. Of the larger companies, he opts for those with good quality portfolios, namely Land Securities, British land and Brixton Estate. In the view of many City analysts, values are likely to drift through this summer. But once property rents start rising, the sector could get a new lease of life. David Tunstall, of Smith New Court, broker, argues that there is plenty of scope for share prices to grow, since the sector is at a relatively early stage of a cyclical upswing. 'We are in a cycle that will last three to four years,' he says.</p>

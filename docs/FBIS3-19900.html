The chancellor, who for more than 11  years has spent 14 to 16 hours a day wallowing in government  business, has a firm opinion about the merry epicure: "He is  lazy."    It is not just Kohl who knows about the unresolved mountains  of files of the president of the Constitutional Court.    A "cordial unrelationship" links the two of them,  according to one of Kohl's ministers. Herzog is by no means  "Kohl's candidate of the heart." For the leader of the CDU  [Christian Democratic Union], the situation with the law  professor, Herzog, is similar to that with the aristocrat,  Richard von Weizsaecker. He did not want the one whom he got. An  irony of history.    No, Roman Herzog will not be a federal president with the  chancellor's favor (if he does become president). The free  thinker is self-confidently celebrating his independence.    It was Tuesday of last week [8 March] in the Bonn Water  Works, the makeshift plenary hall. They were freely discussing  Herzog's candidacy and there was a general setting of boundaries  by Kohl, by Weizsaecker, and by Heitmann.    The friend of clear words contrasts his program to Kohl's  nebulous rhetoric: "We must speak as clear as glass in this  state."    He himself adhered to unity at a time when that was not  customary "in this land of ours," says Herzog. "In this land of  ours," Kohl's patriotic formula until the cabaret performers  ruined it for him. A scornful laugh goes through the hall. Once  again Herzog got carried away with his sarcasm ("my worst  fault").    Things that were taken for granted for 40 years must be  examined. Forty years: that includes Kohl's time in office. In  family policy, for example. Those without children ought to pay  compensation for the families: "That will cost a lot of money."  Herzog mentions Hannelore Roensch. After she made this proposal,  the family minister had to accept a reprimand from Kohl. Herzog  now nonchalantly vindicates her: "A demonstration," is how a CDU  elector later judges his performance.    Setting of boundaries, part two: Weizsaecker, who  found the parties to be "obsessed with power" and who fed the  displeasure with them, is corrected. Herzog: "The political and  social stability of the last 40 years comes from our party  system." Before that in an interview, the president of the court  had accused the parties of a lack of capacity for integration  and had warned against another Weimar. Was there something to  that?    Steffan Heitmann's clumsy ideas about national  socialism were the last nail in his coffin. Herzog chats about  the time of the Nazis without a written speech. Alluding to  Oskar Lafontaine, he talks about secondary virtues that made  concentration camps possible. Of course, Herzog admits affably,  one can run a concentration camp with diligence and punctuality.  But secondary virtues are supposed to be more than that:  interpersonal relations, respect, politeness. "Then I would like  to see the concentration camp that can be run that way."  Performance of duty, punctuality, diligence--these virtues ought  to be employed for human dignity and liberty. Herzog gets past  the reefs but just barely. Afterwards electors say that they  held their breath when they heard this passage. It awakens  memories of Philipp Jenninger, who hit the wrong note in his  rhetoric about national socialism and therefore had to be  replaced as president of the Bundestag. But Herzog is not  Henninger.    Herzog's singular characteristics--they also  include his sensitivity. The president can dish it out, but he  cannot take it so well.    Friedrich Karl Fromme, domestic-policy chief of the  newspaper  FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE, took the candidate Heitmann under his  wings. The editorial writer is now reprimanding Heitmann's  successor Herzog as scarcely anyone else is. Fromme knows the  scene of the jurists. Herzog knows that and therefore this hit  him hard.    And so he is getting revenge publicly with the  publicists--in  front of this team from the CDU/CSU [Christian Social Union].  Fromme (Herzog does not mention his name, because that would be  giving him too much honor) is a "nationally known sourpuss."  Kohl, who eats up journalists, never went that far.    When Richard von Weizsaecker came down from his  aristocratic-presidential Olympus to accuse the parties of being  obsessed with power, Norbert Bluem responded to him in DER  SPIEGEL: "Welcome to the tumult, Mr. Federal President."    Roman Herzog, the uncrowned interview king of recent weeks,  has long since arrived in the tumult of the fast-paced  altercation. Unemployment, integration of foreigners, Europe,  family policy: Herzog knows the answers.    In accordance with the traditional pattern, the altercation  sometimes leans to the left and sometimes to the right. It is  something that they cannot get hold of politically--an  unpredictable factor for the CDU. Its program: Herzog is Herzog.    The tempermental Bavarian by birth does not want to stay out  of the daily political discussion. After all, he is one who  speaks his mind.    Where is it written in the constitution that a president  must  be a substitute emperor?</p>

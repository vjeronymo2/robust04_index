			<p><P> May 15, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> UNBRIDLED MAY LACK VERSATILITY NEEDED TO SUCCEED AT PREAKNESS  </P> <P> The character of the Kentucky Derby winner usually dictates the flavor of the  Preakness.  </P> <P> There is the charismatic Derby winner. Secretariat, Seattle Slew and  Spectacular Bid were of this type. They brought to Pimlico the shared  anticipation of singular accomplishment. A truly special horse can carry  Preakness week by himself.  </P> <P> On the opposite side of charisma's coin is the type that comes to Maryland  having to duplicate the success of Kentucky to establish themselves. Winning  Colors, Alysheba, Ferdinand, Swale, Sunny's Halo, Pleasant Colony and Genuine  Risk fit beneath this umbrella. Some succeed; most fail. The Derby and  Preakness may be racing's second-toughest winning streak.  </P> <P> The exceptions are the horses accompanied to Baltimore by the anticipation of a  rematch. Affirmed was dogged by Alydar, Sunday Silence by Easy Goer. These are  the most compelling Preaknesses and the most rare.  </P> <P> Unbridled fits neatly into the second category. He is a one-paced stayer,  probably at his best at about 1 1/4 miles, always at the mercy of pace and  forever dependent upon the ability of his rider to avoid trouble. He was  clearly the best horse May 5 at Churchill Downs, and he won the Derby  impressively for 92-year-old owner Frances Genter. But he will not be an  overwhelming Preakness favorite Saturday.  </P> <P> Carl Nafzger was confident throughout Derby week that Unbridled would run his  race. He was correct. In fact, every horse in the Derby except Summer Squall  ran Unbridled's race.  </P> <P> Now for the Preakness.  </P> <P> This is a different game, and Unbridled must display versatility he may not  have. Pleasant Colony, Alysheba and Sunday Silence passed this test. Genuine  Risk, Sunny's Halo, Swale, Ferdinand and Winning Colors failed.  </P> <P> Mister Frisky will be a factor in Baltimore. If he can control the track in a  field with a good deal less speed than the Derby, where five horses were sent  after the lead in a suicidal early pace, he threatens to be the Snow Chief of  1990: incinerated in Louisville, exonerated in Baltimore. He worked five  furlongs in 59 2/5 seconds Sunday at Pimlico, significantly faster than he  worked at Churchill a week before the Derby.  </P> <P> But will Mister Frisky control the pace? Kentucky Jazz is the cheap-speed  portion of Wayne Lukas' entry with Land Rush and has the potential to dictate  the race's development. Champagneforashley is another ingredient. He has the  necessary tactical speed. He is fresh and a month off the Wood Memorial. He  should be suited to the distance and will not lose touch with the pace.  </P> <P> And then there is Summer Squall. Is this where he falls off the table? His  performance and his appearance were incongruous in Kentucky. He walked sorely  to be saddled, appearing to favor his left foreleg, was hollow beneath the hip  bones and with ribs protruding. His connections say there is nothing that can  be done for his unsightly appearance, but Summer Squall is fine. And he ran his  heart out as far as he held up in Kentucky, gaining the lead from a tired  Mister Frisky near the mile mark and holding everyone safe except Unbridled.  </P></p>

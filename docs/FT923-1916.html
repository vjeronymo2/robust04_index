			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / Ministers offer hope of small cut in loan rates MINISTERS last night held out the prospect of an early cut in interest rates but sought to play down speculation that sterling's departure from the European exchange rate mechanism had set the stage for a rapid relaxation of anti-inflation policy. The forecast of a fall in borrowing costs before the Conservative party conference - which starts early next month - did little to disguise growing concern within the cabinet about the longer-term implications of the break with the D-Mark. The unease coincided with acknowledgement by Whitehall officials that it was now 'impossible to predict' exactly when sterling would rejoin the ERM. One of Mr John Major's senior colleagues said the uncertainty would foreshadow intense debate within the cabinet over the pace of the pound's re-entry. It is understood that there is no pressure on the prime minister to rejoin over the next few weeks. There is a broad consensus that the immediate priority is to see the establishment of economic recovery in Britain and evidence from Germany that its interest rates are on a downward path. But Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, and other senior ministers are arguing that an indefinite suspension of ERM membership would decisively undercut Britain's economic prospects. Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, and Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, are among others said to believe that the government should be thinking in terms of resuming membership later this year or early next year. Pro-European ministers were emphasising yesterday that the increasing confidence of the Euro-sceptics on the Conservative back benches disguised the fact that the cabinet is stacked heavily against them. Their hope is that Mr Major will reaffirm his commitment to keeping Britain at the 'heart of Europe' during Thursday's emergency Commons debate on the economy. The ministers acknowledged concern that the shock of last week's devaluation may for a time tempt the prime minister to switch his attention from rebuilding bridges with Europe to the need for economic recovery here. The timing and scale of reductions in interest rates will depend on the level at which sterling settles on foreign exchange markets after yesterday's French referendum on the Maastricht treaty. Treasury officials are warning ministers that the devaluation of the pound since last Wednesday has already provided a loosening of monetary policy. If the government moved too quickly to push up domestic demand through lower borrowing costs, the competitive gain from the devaluation would quickly be lost in high inflation. But Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, is expected to judge that even with a lower pound there is scope for a cut of between  1/2 a percentage point and 1 percentage point in base rates over the next few weeks.</p>

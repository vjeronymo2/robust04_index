			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / Jordan-Germany loan agreements Germany and Jordan signed two agreements yesterday under which debt-burdened Amman will get DM37m (Pounds 12.7m) in commodity loans to support the country's trade balance, Reuter reports from Amman. An embassy spokesman said under the first accord, Amman would get DM32m to cover imports of vital commodities needed for civilian use, excluding luxury or military goods. Under the second agreement, Jordan will get DM5m to finance imports needed by Jordan's agricultural sector. Jordan is among the recipients of the largest per capita amount of German aid. Amman has received a total of DM1.63bn, most of it in financial aid, since a bilateral economic co-operation programme began in 1955.</p>

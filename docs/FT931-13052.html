			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / A window on the world: AT&amp;T is positioning itself to take advantage of the increasing convergence of technologies A bizarre decoration hangs in an otherwise bland executive conference room at the New Jersey headquarters of AT&amp;T's Network Systems business, which makes capital equipment for the telecommunications industry. It is a small, scruffy, four-paned window which would be more at home in a junkyard. It looks like the creation of a particularly challenging modern artist, though in reality it is an unusual management teaching aid. Placed on the wall of the windowless conference room by Mr Bill Marx, who heads Network Systems, it is a symbolic reminder to his executives of the need to be looking outwards, trying to anticipate customers' needs. The window could also serve as a symbol of a remarkable shake-up in the entire AT&amp;T group since the watershed year of 1984. That was when the company, previously a US national telephone monopoly known as Ma Bell, was forced to divest its local telephone operations into seven separate businesses - the so-called Baby Bells - in settlement of an anti-trust legal battle. Since then, the rump AT&amp;T, which remains the largest long-distance telecommunications business in the US, has been turned from an inward-looking, complacent bureaucracy into an aggressive global competitor. It is positioning itself to benefit from what may be the most significant industrial upheaval of the next two decades: the expected convergence of telecommunications, computers and video to create a single multi-media industry serving many new markets. For example, the day may not be too far off when affluent westerners are equipped with wireless, hand-held devices which allow them not just to talk, but see each other in video images, receive and send fax messages, and communicate with computers. AT&amp;T wants to be a giant spider at the centre of such webs of communications technology, providing equipment, the knowhow to link it up and, most important, the communications network through which to transmit the traffic. Mr Bob Allen, AT&amp;T's chairman, says it aims to become 'the world's best at bringing people together, giving them easy access to each other and to the information and services they want and need - anytime, anywhere'. His global ambitions are being helped by political as well as technological change. Governments are deregulating and privatising their telecommunications services industries, unleashing powerful competitive forces which are pushing national carriers into convoluted networks of global alliances. Almost every month brings fresh examples of AT&amp;T's vigorous pursuit of its strategy. In September it celebrated the first anniversary of its Dollars 7.5bn takeover of US computer company NCR. In November it announced plans to get into the cellular telephone service business by taking a 33 per cent stake in McCaw Cellular Communications, the largest operator in the US, with the option of majority control later. And over the past few weeks it has forged an alliance with Novell, the computer software group, to develop products linking computer networks with telephones, and agreed to take a stake in Unitel, a Canadian long-distance company. In the age of multi-media, AT&amp;T may have a unique advantage, for it is the world's only information technology company with large interests in three crucial areas - telecommunications services; telecommunications equipment manufacturing, where it serves both the capital and consumer markets; and computers, where the NCR takeover has given critical mass to AT&amp;T's previously loss-making operations. It also owns Bell Laboratories, arguably the world's finest corporate research and development centre. AT&amp;T is co-developer of a technology for high definition television (HDTV) that could be chosen this year as the US national standard. And Wall Street thinks the group wants to round out its multi-media interests by forming a partnership with a large US cable-TV operator. Mr Robert Morris, an analyst with investment bank Goldman Sachs, says that, if AT&amp;T can pull off its 'communacopia' strategy, 'then I don't think there will be any other company in the world which can duplicate what they have done'. Mr Allen, however, is still a long way from proving the strategy a winner. No one knows just how convergence between the industries will work in practice, while AT&amp;T, with a chequered financial record since it divested the Baby Bells, has to show it can deliver strong, sustained earnings growth. Still, the company is looking more like a winner than at any time since it lost its cosy status as a regulated monopoly. That opened it to fierce competition in the long-distance market from relative newcomers such as MCI Communications and Sprint, while in the equipment market it had to fight for previously captive Baby Bell contracts against foreign competitors such as Northern Telecom of Canada and Alcatel of France. This was a blessing in disguise, as it shook the company out of the kind of complacency that has led to profound troubles at two other leading US industrial groups - International Business Machines and General Motors. 'We look back on divestiture as a springboard for new energy in the corporation,' says Mr Marx. Yet the most radical change in AT&amp;T's deep-seated bureaucratic culture arrived only after Mr Allen took over as chairman in 1988 on the unexpected death of the then incumbent, Mr James Olsen. Mr Allen, 58 yesterday, looks an unlikely revolutionary. A tall, slim man with a conservative dress sense, soft voice and undemonstrative manner, he is the son of a small business owner from a small mid-western town and has worked inside the Bell system since leaving college. Yet he also has a reputation for strategic analysis, a quietly wry sense of humour and stubborn determination. He quickly reorganised the monolithic business into 20 separate product areas and made each responsible for the first time for its own pricing, marketing, product development and profits. This pointed up where the group was making and losing money and forced individual businesses to focus more closely on cutting fat. Some 60,000 jobs have been axed over the past four years. At the same time, the shake-up has greatly accelerated decision-making, and made the businesses increasingly aware of customer needs. Mr Victor Pelson, who heads the telecommunications services side of the business, says: 'Whereas five years ago we had maybe a dozen people making the fundamental decisions on how to serve a marketplace, today we have literally hundreds. That's an enormous change.' The cultural revolution - not yet complete - has been helped by the fact that more than half AT&amp;T's employees have joined the group since 1984. Most have also been exposed to Total Quality Management - the popular theory that says companies must devote prodigious energies to satisfying their customers. A new willingness to hire senior executives from outside represents another cultural change. Mr Alex Mandl, the highly regarded chief financial officer, came from conglomerate CSX, while another senior executive, Mr Jerre Stead, was formerly president of Square D, a large electrical components group. Mr David Stone, a leading software strategist, was recently lured from computer company Digital Equipment. AT&amp;T is also becoming more international. Sudden competition at home after 1984 forced it to look abroad for new markets, but its early moves were clumsy, with the collapse of alliances with Philips of the Netherlands and Italy's Olivetti. The group is now moving with more confidence, as demonstrated by two deals last year in eastern Europe: it is playing an important role in the modernisation of the Ukraine's telecommunications system, and was the first western company to invest in Poland's equipment business. It has moved the headquarters of its corded telephone business from the US to France. 'It took us a while to get it - that to compete in Europe we had to be European,' says Mr Robert Kavner, head of Communications Products. The NCR takeover has greatly expanded the international business - the computer company has 60 per cent of its sales outside the US - and Mr Allen suggests AT&amp;T could get 50 per cent of its revenues from abroad by 2000, compared with some 24 per cent now. All this has combined to make AT&amp;T a much more profitable business, with net income before special charges roughly doubling between 1984 and 1991. The company's long-term target is earnings growth of at least 10 per cent a year, and it is expected to announce 1992 results which meet that goal. Even its subsidiary making PBX business phone systems, which has been losing money for years, is back in the black. Yet most of this improvement has come from efficiency gains rather than business growth. In the long-distance market, which still provides some 60 per cent of revenues and an estimated 80 per cent of income, AT&amp;T's profit margins are thought to be the best in the business, thanks to high productivity and modern, digital technology. However, its long-distance revenues have been virtually static since 1984, even though the US market has been enjoying solid volume growth - more than 10 per cent a year in the 1980s, dipping to 6-7 per cent in the recent recession. AT&amp;T has been losing market share to its rivals - on one measure it is down from more than 80 per cent of call volume in 1984 to about 60 per cent now. The effects on revenue have been compounded by a price war in 1990-91 and the insistence of government regulators that the long-distance carriers pass on to consumers cuts in their biggest cost, the access charges paid to local telephone companies to complete calls. Over the past two years AT&amp;T's market share erosion has slowed as it has adopted a more aggressive marketing stance. This has ranged from price cuts to the launch of its own credit card, offering discounts on calls, which in little more than two years has become the second most widely held card in the US. US recovery from recession will boost long-distance traffic, but AT&amp;T needs to encourage more intensive use of its network, preferably by customers who need more sophisticated services, which generate higher revenues. This helps explain much of its interest in multi-media as well as the proposed McCaw deal. McCaw will catapult AT&amp;T from nowhere into the leading position in cellular, the fastest-growing part of US telecommunications, with annual US growth rates of 30 to 40 per cent. The deal has shocked the Baby Bells, which operate rival cellular services to McCaw's, since it potentially brings AT&amp;T into local competition with them for the first time since 1984. Observers suggest AT&amp;T might eventually try to link its long-distance network directly into McCaw's, thus getting round paying access charges to the local telephone companies. But AT&amp;T says it simply needs a presence in cellular to serve customers, who will increasingly demand integrated communications networks. The same long-term logic underlay the takeover of NCR, though the initial goal was to use NCR's expertise to turn AT&amp;T's much smaller computer business to profit. Some 18 months on from the merger, the two businesses appear to have gelled well, and the combined group is modestly profitable - a reasonable achievement, given the red ink at many other large computer companies. It is, however, too early to say whether the merger will develop into more than the sum of its parts, with NCR helping AT&amp;T win contracts for integrated communications and computer networks, and both sides throwing up important new technology ideas. That said, they have already jointly developed an automatic teller machine that will identify a bank customer by voice, rather than numbers punched in a keyboard. And they are working on one that would allow customers to summon up a bank clerk for a conversation on an ATM video screen. Mr Gilbert Williamson, the NCR chairman, says the early results from six teams looking at cross-fertilisation makes him 'really enthusiastic about the potential'. Still, AT&amp;T's overall strategy could have some big pitfalls. First, the Baby Bells, still the main customers for its telecommunications capital equipment, may be reluctant to buy from a direct, cellular competitor. Nor is it clear that large corporate customers will want to entrust so much of their business to mighty AT&amp;T. The history of IBM over the past decade shows that huge, integrated technology companies are not necessarily a match for a collection of nimble, niche players. However, senior executives across AT&amp;T insist that the most successful companies in the coming revolution will be those that can provide simple, transparent solutions to customers' complex communications problems. AT&amp;T, they say, is positioning itself to do just that. An article on NCR after the takeover will appear on the Management page tomorrow</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Jibril al-Rajub, Yasir 'Arafat's aide, in </F> Tunis, by Gid'on Zelinger and Moti Amir, recorded `earlier  today'; place not given]    [Text] [Al-Rajub] What did 'Arafat mean? He meant that  the killing of innocent people -- as was the case in Hebron  today -- must stop.    [Zelinger] What is the chairman's mood? Did you meet him  this morning?    [Al-Rajub] I was the first one who received the information  about the Hebron incident, and I was the one who called and woke  'Arafat up. As you know, he was sleeping at the time. I gave  him details about the incident. He was indeed very agitated.    [Zelinger] One of the leaders of the rejectionist front  organizations -- those who oppose 'Arafat and the peace process  -- suggested that 'Arafat use his personal revolver and commit  suicide. He said that 'Arafat and his peace process are a  failure.    [Al-Rajub] Look, nobody will teach us how to behave in such  situations. I think that the lunatic and insane person who  perpetrated the murder in Hebron today killed all the  possibilities of pursuing the peace process.    [Zelinger] Is it that bad?    [Al-Rajub] Yes, this is what I believe. But those who  oppose us can say whatever they want. They won't teach 'Arafat  and Fatah how to behave in such situations.    [Amir] Jibril al-Rajub, you are 'Arafat's adviser for West  Bank affairs and are familiar with the Hebron events. You know  that only one individual was responsible for this criminal  attack. Do you believe that this tragic and criminal incident  was the last nail in the Oslo agreement's coffin, and is this  what you advised 'Arafat?    [Al-Rajub] This is my personal opinion. I do not believe  this was the work of one person. I do not think he could have  perpetrated the attack without the support of somebody from the  IDF [Israel Defense Forces] or the Israeli security services.    [Zelinger] I want to understand, Mr. al-Rajub, are you  recommending that 'Arafat terminate -- or at least freeze -- the  peace process?    [Al-Rajub] I am expressing my opinion as a fighter and a  Palestinian. This is my personal opinion.    [Zelinger] So you are speaking to us as a fighter and not as  a man of peace?    [Al-Rajub] I am a Palestinian citizen and fighter, as you  know. I think that the man who shot the worshipers today killed  all the possibilities for continuing the peace process in the  region.    [Zelinger] I want to understand you better; do you believe  that the current peace process, based on the Oslo  understandings, has no chances of success?    [Al-Rajub] I do not think that any progress has been made.  There was talk of progress, but the agreement should have been  implemented months ago, but nothing was done yet.    [Zelinger] Is this your personal opinion? We heard a  similar opinion expressed by several opposition members in the  territories. What does 'Arafat think?    [Al-Rajub] The PLO leadership is currently meeting. I  believe 'Arafat is under great stress. I think that it is still  impossible to understand or speak about what happened in Hebron  today.    [Zelinger] One thing is certain, though. The position you  are expressing is playing into the hands of all those who oppose  the peace process, whether Jews or Arabs.    [Al-Rajub] Look, I also cannot understand how after this  incident people were still killed by the IDF....[several words  indistinct] Our blood is also sacred.    [Zelinger] Will you resign if 'Arafat pursues the peace  process?    [Al-Rajub] I will draw my own conclusions.    [Amir] Jibril al-Rajub, you have heard the torrent of  denunciations coming from the direction of the Israeli  president, prime minister, and ministers. All of them referred  to it as a tragic and despicable act perpetrated by one person.  The Israeli supporters of the peace process are anxiously  following this process and we are greatly interested in what the  Palestinians think. You -- 'Arafat's aide -- are saying that  this act terminated the entire peace process. Will Yasir  'Arafat pursue the peace process?    [Al-Rajub] I am not the chairman's spokesman. You must  realize, however, that there is a difference between denouncing  such attacks and between taking steps to prevent their  recurrence. I do not think this was the first such incident,  but it is extremely grave and I believe we must draw the  appropriate conclusions as a nation and an organization. Two  months ago we started talking about peace and coexistence, but  so far nothing has moved in that direction.    [Zelinger] You presented yourself both as 'Arafat's aide and  a fighter. What do you have to say today to your fighters in  the Gaza Strip and the West Bank -- the Fatah Hawks? Will they  receive new instructions now?    [Al-Rajub] It is possible that they will receive new  instructions. If real means to protect the Palestinian citizens  are not implemented I think we will have to issue new orders. I  say this with regret.    [Amir] Does this mean breaking the agreement on a cessation  to Fatah hostile acts and resuming the attacks?    [Al-Rajub] I am afraid that unless real measures are not  taken to protect the Palestinian citizens there will be new  orders.    [Zelinger] Is it possible that you are speaking now in a  state of extreme agitation and that you will change your mind in  the next few days?    [Al-Rajub] I cannot say so now, but let's wait and see.    [Zelinger] I want to thank you, Jibril al-Rajub -- one of  the most senior aides of 'Arafat in Tunis. I understand you  want to add something before we take our leave of you.    [Al-Rajub] I only wanted to tell you that for us war is not  an end, but only a means of achieving peace and security for our  people. In this case I do not think it is the right way  [sentence as heard].</p>

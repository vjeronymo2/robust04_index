			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / Racal to split debt with Chubb under demerger terms RACAL Electronics yesterday announced the terms of the demerger of Chubb, its security subsidiary, to complete an unbundling of the group by its chairman, Sir Ernest Harrison, which began with the flotation of Vodafone. The main element of the proposal is an equal split of Racal Electronics' debt with the new Chubb Group. Chubb's shares and Racal's shares, after a one-for-five share consolidation, will begin trading officially on October 5 if shareholders approve the proposals. Sir Ernest said the demerger continued the process of gaining 'appropriate stock market recognition for the component businesses' within Racal. Before Racal distributed its 80 per cent stake in Vodafone to its shareholders last year the market effectively valued the group at a level that suggested the non-Vodafone business had no value at all. While the unbundling of Vodafone benefited Racal shareholders - their 80 per cent of Vodafone is now worth about Pounds 2.3bn and Racal has a market capitalisation of more than Pounds 900m compared with a total market value of about Pounds 2bn before the unbundling was announced - the merits of demerging Chubb are less immediately obvious. Sir Ernest said yesterday his advisers expected little difference in market ratings of Chubb and Racal after the demerger. Added value would come from benefits from standing alone and a premium that would develop as a result of bid speculation. 'There will be two bid premiums instead of one,' said Mr David Elsbury, chief executive of Racal Electronics. It is proposed that Chubb will float with half Racal's debt, or about Pounds 60m at rates prevailing at the last balance sheet date in April. This will give Chubb gearing of about 42.4 per cent, and most of the non-dollar borrowings. Racal's pro-forma gearing in April would have been 12.3 per cent; it will enjoy most of the benefit of the low-interest dollar borrowings. Racal said Chubb profits would continue to improve. In the 28 weeks to October 9 they would be no less than Pounds 28m, up 35 per cent. Chubb said it would demerge Chubb during its successful defence against a hostile bid from Williams Holdings last year. Lex, Page 26; Details, Page 28</p>

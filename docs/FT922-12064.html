			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Brokers cut Rank forecasts THREE BROKERS were called in to see Rank Organisation yesterday prior to the leisure group moving into its closed period, and all seemingly emerged to cut their profits forecasts. Continuing worries over the performance of its part-owned subsidiary Fuji Xerox were thought to have influenced the downgrades, although other anxieties emerged. All three houses - County NatWest, Hoare Govett and Goldman Sachs - were already at the bottom of the range of analysts' forecasts. County shaved Pounds 5m off its estimate to Pounds 265m, and Hoare's figure was also down that amount to Pounds 270m. Goldman was reported to be downgrading by a similar amount. This, and the fact that Rank has had a good run, moved County on to a short-term sell stance. Fuji Xerox is part of Rank Xerox, the office equipment group which contributes 60 per cent to Rank Organisation's overall profits. There was also some disquiet on the US video distribution business. The shares lost 19 to 739p. Marshalls placing Ibstock Johnsen was said to have sold its 4.2 per cent stake in Marshalls, the Halifax-based building materials company, raising Pounds 3.6m for the hard-pressed brick and forestry products group. The 3.9m shares were sold by Ibstock at 85p - apparently by Ibstock's broker James Capel - and placed at 86p. Ibstock is believed to have made a small profit on its holding. The shares were picked up by three large institutional buyers within minutes of being offered. Marshalls was unmoved at 88p, and Ibstock firmed a penny to 86p in turnover of 3.6m. Life assurance companies followed the market's downward trend, ahead of a buy note on the sector from UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. Mr Youssef Ziai, insurance specialist at UBS, pointed out that the life sector has underperformed the market by 8 per cent since the beginning of the year, but he expects it to recover as political risk has been removed following the general election. The prospect of lower interest rates and economic recovery is also positive for life assurance companies, according to Mr Ziai, as well as the conclusion of the ABI's accounting proposals for life companies. UBS believes this could produce room for a 10 per cent upward rerating when companies publish their restated figures. Legal &amp; General finished 2 firmer at 390p, but other stocks in the sector lost ground, with Britannic, one of UBS's buy recommendations, falling 11 to 854p and Refuge, another on the favoured list, slipping 7 to 658p. A shortage of stock exacerbated rises in leading property shares as the weekend talk of economic recovery brought buyers into the sector. MEPC forged ahead 17 to 317p, Land Securities 12 to 412p, British Land 23 to 215p and Slough Estates 9 to 187p. Exotic fruits and banana importer Geest declined 4 to 369p as company president Mr John van Geest disposed of 1.25m shares in the market, representing 1.75 per cent of Geest's equity, via a placing at 360p per share. After Mr van Geest's disposal the Seaq ticker revealed a line of 920,000 had been placed at 363p. There was a late flurry of activity in the regional electricity stocks and the Electricity Package, thought to have represented more unravelling of the Package units. Large late trades of 1m shares each in some of the regional electricity companies saw East Midlands climb 3 to 291p and Eastern a penny to 281p. The Electricity Package closed 10 higher at Pounds 3155. Highest turnover of the day was in Scottish Power, at 10m shares, as the price receded 3 1/2 to 94p. Scottish Hydro, also active on trade of 7.9m shares, slipped 3 1/2 to 99p. Pharmaceuticals again suffered a hangover from Wall Street as US investors continued their drift from the sector into more cyclical stocks. There was also negative sentiment surrounding US drugs group Merck, which reported fairly pedestrian first-quarter figures last week, reflecting on selected London drugs stocks. Glaxo tumbled 34 to 754p, Medeva fell 25 to 259p and SmithKline Beecham dropped 39 to 833p. Merck's low level of price increases disappointed the market, and SmithKline is expected to follow this trend when it reports tomorrow. This, together with the cost of launching several new products, is expected to limit profits growth. Cable and Wireless lost ground after a rumour that its broker had downgraded the telecoms group. There was also talk of additional pressure from the options market with the expiry today of the April 550 series. The shares slipped 14 to 558p. Big international earners among brewery stocks lost out to cyclical companies, on hopes of an economic upturn in the UK. Guinness slipped 8 1/2 to 563p and Grand Metropolitan 10 to 460p, but Bass improved 4 to 615p and Allied-Lyons 2 to 640p. Whitbread 'A' was steady at 444p. Midland Bank eased a further 2 to 360p as the market continued to take on board last week's disposal of 60m shares by the Kuwait Investment Office and doubts that Lloyds Bank will produce a bid to counter the agreed offer for Midland from Hongkong and Shanghai Banking. Lloyds lost 2 to 391p, while the problems surrounding property company Olympia &amp; York continued to weigh on Barclays, 5 lower at 334p. Simon Engineering declined 7 to 270p after Smith New Court weighed in with a profits downgrade for the current year. The broker cut its figure by 13 per cent to Pounds 18.8m. Mr Iain Lowe at Smith said: 'First-half profits are likely to be worse than we had hoped and the indication is that the company will not be among the first to emerge out of the recession.'

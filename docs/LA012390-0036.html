			<p><P> January 23, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CASE AGAINST JUDGE SHOULD REMAIN IN SAN DIEGO, COURT RULES  </P> <P> A lawsuit that claims a San Diego family-court judge committed fraud and legal  malpractice before he took the bench should be heard in San Diego County, a  state appellate court ruled Monday.  </P> <P> The 4th District Court of Appeal ordered the case against Judge Thomas Ashworth  III returned to San Diego Superior Court, saying it was improperly ordered out  of the county.  </P> <P> Judge Michael I. Greer, former presiding judge of San Diego Superior Court, was  wrong to take it upon himself last November to order the case to Orange County  because he did not follow the proper procedures for a transfer, the unanimous  three-judge appellate court said.  </P> <P> In addition, the panel said, there is "no evidence" to show that Ashworth  cannot get an impartial trial in San Diego.  </P> <P> The $3-million suit was filed against Ashworth in 1987 by a Northern California  woman, Virginia Searles, charging him with fraud and malpractice while he  served as her divorce lawyer, before he took the bench in 1986.  </P> <P> Ashworth negligently allowed Searles' husband and others to defraud her of  possibly millions of dollars from an insurance company and other properties the  couple owned, the suit charges.  </P> <P> Although the suit was filed more than two years ago, it has yet to be assigned  to a judge for trial.  </P> <P> First, San Diego Superior Court Judge Ben Hamrick bowed out, saying he had a  conflict of interest because of his working relationship with Ashworth. Next,  the Imperial County judge to whom it was assigned withdrew, saying he once had  served on a legal panel with Ashworth.  </P> <P> In September, Greer indicated he would ask the state to assign a judge from  outside the county. But, at a Nov. 30 hearing, Greer decided himself, over  Searles' objection, to transfer the case to the Orange County Superior Court.  </P> <P> Searles appealed Greer's decision. The 4th District agreed with her that Greer  acted improperly, saying he deprived her of due-process rights by not giving  her an opportunity to file legal papers objecting to a transfer before the Nov.  30 hearing.  </P> <P> In ordering the case returned to San Diego, Justice Howard Wiener said the  current presiding judge of the local Superior Court, Judith McConnell, should  ask the state to provide an out-of-town judge to hear the case.  </P> <P> Judges Patricia Benke and Don Work concurred in the decision.  </P> <P> Despite the ruling, the case still might not be heard in San Diego. Ashworth's  lawyer, Patrick McCormick, said Monday night that he will ask that the case be  heard in another county.  </P> <P> Searles' lawyers, as well as Ashworth and Greer, could not be reached Monday  for comment.  </P></p>

			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / Class conflict in Munich Munich's art and antiques fair was the first of its kind in Germany. After more than 30 years, it is arguably still the best, and a new-broom administration this year has produced the most elegant event to date. Yet it seems uncertain that Munich will ever establish itself as an international event. It is not at all clear what the fair wants to be. The new-style 39th German Art &amp; Antiques Fair International opens its doors to foreign dealers, but exhibits rather few of them. Apart from an illustrious group of antiquaires prominently placed by the entrance, there are only a dozen other non-German dealers - half the number of the previous year. Here, world-class objects rub shoulders uncomfortably with the gemutlich. Some dealers display the likes of a Susini bronze statuette after Giambologna, a spectacular piece of Augsburg silver, or a Degas drawing. Others offer rows of Bavarian cherubs neatly repainted in gilt. This state of affairs is unlikely to change while the fair is organised by the Association of Bavarian Art &amp; Antique Dealers (there is no national association in Germany). The majority of its members have nothing to gain, and potentially a great deal to lose, if international participation is increased and standards raised. Local dealers with international businesses such as Konrad Bernheimer, whose grandfather founded the fair in 1955, Albrecht Neuhaus, and Bruce Livie of Galerie Arnoldi-Livie, have been arguing for a decade that the fair's future lay as an international event. Now that the European Fine Art Foundation, organiser of the highly successful Maastricht fair, has decided on Basel for the venue for its new event, it may well be that Munich is offering too little too late. It will be interesting to see how many dealers, German and foreign, transfer their allegiance to Basel. Certainly the success of Maastricht has been to the detriment of the Rhineland fair, which was not hitherto open to the foreign trade. Perhaps the organisers at Munich should concentrate on consolidating its position as the leading German fair. A number of innovations this year bode well for its future, notably improved presentation, a handsome loan exhibition, Odiot a Paris, and a lecture programme. There is still scope, however, for improving the overall quality of the fair without destroying its Bavarian flavour. Encouraging good, classic, modern art may be one solution. It is, after all, what people seem to be buying in Germany at present, and there seems to be a market here. Over the opening weekend, Galerie Norbert Blaeser of Dusseldorf sold works by Ernst Wilhelm Nay, Picasso and Alexej von Jawlensky to one private collector, and another Jawlensky, 'Mystical Head with Brown Eyes' for about DM580,000 (Pounds 237,000). Munich's trump card is that the Bavarian capital will always be a city that people like to visit - its hinterland is also conveniently rich. The fair has the reputation of showing important works of art, and this year is no exception. It is predominantly an 'objects' rather than a 'pictures' fair, although one of this year's highlights is an impressive Lucas Cranach of the 'Virgin and Child with a sleeping John the Baptist' (asking price DM2.5m). On the stand of Neuse of Bremen, you can find a 33-piece Augsburg silver-gilt travel service of 1745-49 alongside its original fitted leather case (about DM2m), a choice group of Baroque Wunderkammer items, and furniture that might almost pass as sculpture. The Deutsche Kunst- und Antiquitatenmesse International continues until tomorrow at the Messegelande Theriesen hohe, Munich, 10am-6pm</p>

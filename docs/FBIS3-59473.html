			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovene </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by D.H.: "185,000 Holders of Dual Citizenship"] </F>   [Text] Ljubljana--Yesterday we reported on the Interior  Ministry news conference on the topic of dual citizenship. We  received quite accurate data on the number of citizens of the  Republic of Slovenia who hold dual citizenship. These data  should be given some serious consideration.    There are 169,313 people from the former Yugoslav republics  who have received Slovene citizenship in accordance with Article  40 of the Law on Citizenship, of whom 78,000 (46.7 percent) are  from Bosnia-Herzegovina and also hold Bosnian citizenship,  60,000 (34.8 percent) from Croatia, 22,000 (13 percent) from  Serbia, 5,000 (2.9 percent) from Macedonia, and less than 5,000  (2.8 percent) from Montenegro.    It is known that 80 percent of the almost 170,000 citizens  from other republics of the former Yugoslavia who have received  Slovene citizenship are unskilled workers. On average, they had  resided in Slovenia eight years before obtaining Slovene  citizenship, and a good fifth were unemployed. There are also  15,000 Slovenes who live in other European countries or overseas  and hold dual citizenship. In total, there are approximately  185,000 citizens of Slovenia who hold dual citizenship.</p>

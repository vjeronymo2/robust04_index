			<p>BFN     [Text] On April 21 in Brussels, head of the Russian Foreign  Ministry Andrey Kozyrev will not only sign the basic document on  Russia's joining NATO's Partnership for Peace program but will  submit the so called presentation document. Russia will present  its point of view regarding cooperation and partnership with  NATO and will point out concrete directions of this cooperation,  Director of RF [Russian Federation] Foreign Ministry's European  Cooperation Department Yuriy Ushakov declared in his interview  with Interfax on Wednesday.    Ushakov explained that out of all 14 countries which  expressed their willingness to join the Partnership for Peace  program only Poland had presented such practical documents.  "Other countries have not submitted any presentation documents  because they are probably not ready yet," said Ushakov.    In his words, Russia's cooperation with NATO in the  frameworks of the Partnership program should be "of a special  character." "It should take into consideration Russia's role on  the international arena and our military might as a nuclear  power," explained Ushakov.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed ABS: "Minister Urbain Returns From Damascus: </F> Solve the Debt Problem"; as released by Brussels BELGA Database]    [Text] Brussels, 26 Jan (BELGA) -- On his return from  Damascus, where he paid an official visit on Monday and Tuesday  [24-25 January], Foreign Trade and European Affairs Minister  Robert Urbain reviewed his mission to Syria, a country that  offers good prospects for cooperation following the signing of  the peace agreements in Palestine. The Belgian minister also  admitted, however, that obstacles remain, as Syria has not  serviced its foreign debt for several years now.    Although for Belgium this debt is under 500 million Belgian  francs, this situation has resulted in Syria being unfavorably  appraised by the National Export Guarantee Office, which has  refused to cover the "Syrian" risk.    Minister Urbain, who met with the principle ministers  responsible for the economy (economic affairs, foreign trade,  plan, energy) while in Damascus, has suggested that the debt  problem should be the subject of exploratory discussions in  Damascus between the National Export Guarantee Office and the  Syrian authorities in order to rapidly reach solutions  acceptable to both parties. If the debt problem could be solved  -- either within the "Paris Club" or in any other way -- trade  would then quickly intensify, he believes.    In the meantime, Minister Urbain can only observe that there  is a clear trade balance in favor of the UEBL [Belgo-Luxembourg  Economic Union].    In 1992, the UEBL exported goods worth 3.6 billion Belgian  francs to Syria, and worth 2.9 billion Belgian francs during the  first nine months of 1993 (foodstuffs and manufactured goods).    The UEBL imported goods worth 432 million Belgian francs  from  Syria in 1992, and worth just 76 million Belgian francs during  the first nine months of 1993. There is therefore a clear  imbalance. The need to correct this is made even more evident as  Syria's economic and financial situation has shown a marked  improvement over the last two years: The Gulf countries have  stopped their aid to the country and domestic oil production has  increased.    Also, Damascus is conducting an open foreign policy and has  even started a process to privatize the economy. Syria's needs  in the infrastructure and energy sectors -- both sectors of  interest to Belgian industry -- are major.    During the recent mission, contacts were already established  between Syrian partners and Belgian companies in the  construction and telecommunications sectors.    A UEBL-Syria economic cooperation agreement will be signed  shortly, Minister Urbain has announced. This will make it  possible to arrange regular sessions of a joint economic  committee with representatives from the three countries.    Damascus has also shown interest in a financial cooperation  between the two issuing authorities (the Belgian National Bank  and the Syrian Central Bank), in the following sectors in  particular: staff training, bank note printing, financial  transactions between banking institutions.</p>

			<p><P> December 31, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> STYROCOP GETS STAR BILLING IN FIGHT ON FOAM  </P> <P> Like a patrolman on the beat, Lee Barrett strides into a Chinese restaurant,  flashes his ID card and has a look around. "StyroCop" is on the trail of  illicit carryout containers.  </P> <P> The city has gotten a complaint that the restaurant is putting its egg rolls  and fried rice in boxes that violate Portland's year-old ban on polystyrene  foam fast-food containers.  </P> <P> Barrett, 44, a longtime environmental activist, is the ban's enforcer. A local  television reporter dubbed him StyroCop -- a takeoff on the movie "RoboCop" --  his first day on the job, and he's become something of a celebrity.  </P> <P> The Portland law does not restrict containers made of paper or plastic not  blown into foam. Those have been the alternatives used by fast-food  restaurants, the only industry affected by the Portland law.  </P> <P> Businesses cited by Barrett face fines of $250 for a first offense and $500 for  each subsequent offense.  </P> <P> Neither a police officer nor a health inspector, Barrett only responds to  complaints received by the city. He's written only a handful of tickets but  says the law is a start and has raised public awareness.  </P> <P> Back at the Chinese restaurant, Barrett spots a stack of carryout containers in  the kitchen and holds one up.  </P> <P> "That's a hundred percent polystyrene," he said. "Zero percent air." It's  legal. Barrett asks to see a storeroom downstairs, where he finds more of the  same.  </P></p>

			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / Property debt sale urged by Bank THE BANK of England yesterday urged banks to consider selling their loans to property companies in the form of property-backed bonds. Mr Pen Kent, an associate director of the Bank of England, said that converting debt into securities 'frees the way for property companies to raise new capital, refinance debt and strengthen their own balance sheets, and in some instances injects liquidity into the market'. Speaking at the launch of the Association of Property Bankers Mr Kent for the first time gave qualified support to the newly created market in distressed corporate debt. In an speech last year Mr Kent concentrated on the potential pitfalls for a company in financial difficulties if that company's banks decided to sell the loans they had made to it. Yesterday, however, he said that the sale of the debt to new investors had 'the potential for a beneficial and productive effect for a company in difficulties'. New investors might have expertise relevant to the company or might be able to take a longer-term view of the returns to be made from the debt than the company's bankers. Mr Kent made two suggestions aimed at reducing the risk that banks would repeat their 1980s error of acquiring excessive exposure to property in different parts of the country. He asked whether 'banks would benefit from a closer awareness of the planning and development process'. He also invited bankers to comment on whether it would be useful for new and more detailed statistics to be gathered on property lending and how this could be done.</p>

Interior Minister 'Ali Mohammad Besharati, in an interview  with our correspondent, also said: The task of closing the  borders in the vulnerable areas began from four months ago. The  job was completed by digging canals of four meters deep and four  meters wide, erection of many watch towers, and planting of  mines along the routes used by the drug trafficking convoys. At  present there is no possibility of such convoys finding their  way into the country.    About the recent disturbances in Zahedan, which took place  with provocation of the drug traffickers, the interior minister  praised the Muslim and revolutionary people of Zahedan for  staging a rally on Sunday to condemn the action of these  saboteurs. He said: The Shiite and Sunni brothers and sisters,  by staging a march in Zahedan to protest against the drug  traffickers, have once again demonstrated their support for the  Islamic revolution, the esteemed leader, and the president, and  they have terminated all the conspiracies spread by internal and  foreign enemies.</p>

The 5-year-old son of Monteverdi  paid $364.80, $91.40 and $15.60.  </P> <P> Beau Genius, the 122-pound highweight who battled with Norquestor for the early  lead, finished third. Summer Squall, carrying 119 pounds, never got closer than  fifth place and eventually faded to eighth. Mi Selecto was fourth with Opening  Verse sixth.  </P></p>

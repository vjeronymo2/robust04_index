			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / UK Company News: GA plays down US asbestosis claims GENERAL ACCIDENT, the composite insurance company, yesterday insisted that it was fully reserved against asbestosis claims arising from a US court judgment earlier this month. Fears that GA's exposure to the claims, which arise from underwriting operations in Australia, weakened the company's share price yesterday, leading to a 5p fall on the day to 687p. The claims concern public liability policies bought by CSR, the Australian building materials and mining group, and were made by US workers injured by asbestos mined and exported by a CSR subsidiary, Midalco, at the Wittenoom asbestos mine in Australia. The insurance policies in question were written between 1955 and 1978. In the latest stage of a complex and long-running liability suit a Mississippi court ruled against CSR on August 5. CSR was ordered to pay damages of Dollars 2m (Pounds 1.3m) to four plaintiffs. GA said yesterday that the risks were reinsured, that it was fully reserved and that the claims were 'irrelevant in the context of GA's current level of business.' GA is also in litigation with CSR on these matters and a result was unlikely to be reached for 'several years'.</p>

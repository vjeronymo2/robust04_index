			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ORR first instituted a set-aside for MAAs over 10 years ago as an incentive to States to work with and fund MAAs. At that time, MAAs were emerging as important organizations in the refugee resettlement field. We felt that States needed to be encouraged to begin funding these organizations as service providers. Today, the situation is quite different; we believe that MAAs are now in a position to compete effectively for refugee social services funds. Many MAAs have succeeded in becoming highly qualified and experienced service agencies and, in many States, have been able to obtain a much higher level of refugee social service funding than is available under the MAA set-aside. For this reason, we believe the MAA set-aside has served its purpose and should be discontinued at the Federal level. This in no way suggests that States should lower their commitment to using MAAs to provide services to refugees; to the contrary, we expect and encourage States to continue to use MAAs as service providers at levels comparable to previous years. In addition, MAAs may compete for funding under ORR's discretionary programs which are open to nonprofit organizations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We inadvertently deleted the language that has appeared in previous notices requiring States to assist MAAs in seeking other public and/or private funds for the provision of services to refugee clients. We have included similar language in this notice which strongly encourages, but does not require, States to assist MAAs in seeking other public and/or private funds for the provision of services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two commenters requested clarification regarding ORR's expectation that States should ensure that refugee social services are provided to special populations such as Amerasians and former political prisoners from Vietnam. One commenter made the point that all refugees are special populations. Another commenter felt that while a State can ensure that services are made available to special populations, a State cannot ensure that services are provided, since it cannot ensure that refugees will access the services offered. The commenter suggested that the language in the notice be revised to acknowledge this distinction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The phrase ``such as'' is not intended to suggest an inclusive list of special populations, but simply to provide examples of such special populations. We agree that States can only ensure that services are made available to refugees. The language in the notice has been changed to reflect ORR's expectation that States should ensure that refugee social services are made available to special populations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two commenters requested clarification regarding ORR's expectation that States should ensure that a coherent plan of services is developed for each eligible family that addresses the family's needs from time of arrival until attainment of economic independence. One commenter pointed out that a plan of services can only be developed for individuals and families that access services and recommended that the language in the notice be revised to clarify this point. The commenter also questioned how the definition of an ``eligible family'' would apply to recent arrivals who are single. Another commenter questioned what is meant by ``a coherent plan of services from time of arrival until attainment of economic independence''.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Our intent regarding a coherent plan of services is for such a plan to be developed for every family that applies for services or receives cash assistance. We believe that a State can ensure that this is carried out by requiring its providers to develop such plans. Refugees who are single individuals, without family, should be considered an eligible one-person family unit. ``A coherent plan of services from time of arrival until attainment of economic independence'' means the development of a comprehensive service plan that includes the provision of employment-related and other services needed to help a newly arrived family move to a point of economic self-support.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Three commenters commented on ORR's expectation that services should be provided in a manner that is culturally and linguistically compatible. Two of the commenters indicated that this expectation would require the provision of services through a refugee-specific system which, they felt, would be financially impractical. Both commenters felt that it would be more cost-effective to fold refugee services into the existing mainstream system. Another commenter expressed support for the provision of services through a refugee-specific system. One commenter asked for a clear definition of what ``culturally and linguistically compatible'' means.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  What ORR means by the provision of services in a manner that is culturally and linguistically compatible is that an agency providing refugee social services must employ or contract with staff who (1) speak the native language of and (2) are either from the same ethnic background as, or are culturally knowledgeable of, the refugee populations the agency serves, and must use these staff in the provision of services to refugee clients.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regarding the cost-effectiveness of a refugee-specific service system, we believe that the investment of refugee program funds in a refugee-specific service system, particularly in the initial years after a refugee's arrival in the U.S., will prove to be more cost-effective in the long run than serving refugees through a mainstream system. The provision of services through a service provider system whose only clientele is refugees is likely to result in more tailored and comprehensive services to refugees, resulting, we believe, in earlier employment and self-sufficiency than what would otherwise occur when refugees are served through a mainstream system. Refugees often tend to receive minimal services or are the last to be served in mainstream systems where they are one of many client groups served. We wish to emphasize, however, that there is nothing to preclude, and in fact we encourage, the use of mainstream resources to augment the services provided through a refugee-specific service system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

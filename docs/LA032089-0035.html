			<p><P> March 20, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: EXIT LINES  </P> <P> Academy Award-winning film-maker Joseph L. Mankiewicz, 80, in San Francisco to  receive the 1989 Akira Kurosawa award for lifetime achievement from the San  Francisco International Film Festival: "I don't know anything about Hollywood  today. I don't know the people. . . . I'm very sad that American film has  become, in my opinion, the major motivation for the American being as detested  as he is throughout the world. All they see in American movies is variations on  obscenity, boozing and (sex) . . . and they'll look you in the eye and say,  'Yeah, I know. Isn't it awful?' They're crying all the way to the bank."

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From MAINICHI SHIMBUN 29 May Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] On 27 May, a top Ministry of International Trade  and Industry [MITI] official declared: "We will not promise  numbers which are determined by market mechanisms." He made  this remark in reference to the fact the numerical targets'  definition is still not clear even though Japan and the United  States have agreed not to include numerical targets as an  objective criteria measure in the Japan-U.S. economic talks,  which are due to resume soon. He said even when the United  States asks for something that comes close to numerical targets  -- like a growth rate measure --, Japan will reject it at the  sector-by-sector talks.    Asked about the possibility that at the automobile and auto  part talks, the United States might ask to set targets on the  number of auto dealers, he said: "We cannot make any promise on  something that is out of the government's reach."</p>

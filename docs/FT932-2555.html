			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Scottish auditors press for change THE INSTITUTE of Chartered Accountants of Scotland is to launch a lobbying campaign to support its controversial proposals for the restructuring of auditing in the UK. In a document issued this week it suggests the creation of an audit review panel for every quoted company, independent of management, which would supervise the appointment of auditors, agree their remuneration and receive their reports. It also calls for a substantial increase in the importance of the internal audit function in companies with the introduction of a chief internal auditor to be appointed by a committee of non-executive directors. The institute has submitted its conclusions to bodies including the Department of Trade and Industry and the Auditing Practices Board. It will be considering a series of research projects to explore issues in the report in more detail. Its document - Auditing into the Twenty-First Century - stresses that directors should provide greater assurances to the public on whether their company has adequate resources to continue operating in the future and on action taken to minimise the risk of fraud. It says auditors - renamed 'assessors' - should report on the reliability of internal controls with a detailed statement signed by a named partner in an accountancy firm. It says the audit review panel should comprise about three members drawn from a list held by the Stock Exchange. Members of the panel would appoint their own successors from the list. The institute has a reputation for making controversial and influential recommendations. Several years ago it produced Making Corporate Reports Valuable, which has formed the basis for many of the recommendations by the Accounting Standards Board. Its officials were also instrumental in establishing the Cadbury committee on the financial aspects of corporate governance, which reported in December. Mr Mike Townsend, finance director of Rolls-Royce, said he believed strengthening internal audit was inevitable, but called the suggestions to remove power over the auditors from executive directors 'very odd'.</p>

			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / Time runs out for Councillor Sproggins: Alison Smith explains how the reduced role of local politicians is likely to be further diminished COUNCILLORS elected this week are likely to find that their job descriptions have altered dramatically by the time they ask the voters to renew their contracts in four years. Councillors who now see themselves as full-time providers may by then have become part-time enablers. Labour's local election campaign was marked by doom-laden warnings about the downgrading of local authorities under threat from central government. The move away from the council as centre of the local universe, as envisaged by the Tories, was summed up by one Conservative who said: 'The days of Councillor Sproggins House or Councillor Bloggins Way are over.' The parties are united, however, in emphasising the continuing importance of local government. Both Mr John Redwood, the local government minister, and Mr Bryan Gould, the shadow environment secretary, describe councils as a vital element in the UK's plural democracy. Officials at the environment department believe that the present ministerial team has a less minimalist view of the constitutional role of local councils than Mr Michael Heseltine, the former environment secretary. This belief in councils' constitutional role may bring little comfort to councillors conscious that both the main parties have seen a declining variety of candidates as one of the main pressures for change. If Labour had been in power this point would have been addressed by giving authorities a wider role and by making some posts salaried. Mr Gould said: 'I believe that being a councillor should be a full-time occupation for some people, not a hobby people indulge in during the evenings.' Under the present government the response is to try to cut down the commitment. The role of local authorities will continue to shrink, partly through more schools becoming grant-maintained - though councils will be taking on responsibility for community care - partly through tightening government controls on local spending, and partly through further challenges to automatic provision of services. In spite of these trends Mr Redwood can still point to the discretion councils have in the provision of some services and can highlight how planning decisions give them 'enormous power over the private-sector life of this country'. His argument that detailed government intervention in the delivery of some local services through setting procedures for compulsory competitive tendering (CCT) merely amounts to 'suggesting ways in which things could be better managed' is, however, likely to be greeted with a hollow laugh in town halls. This is particularly so as government intervention through CCT is to be extended, with introduction into housing mangement a priority. Sir George Young, the housing minister, speaks of councils developing a more challenging and important role once they hand over the management of their housing stock. Mr Redwood believes that the council's role as a provider of services can inhibit its ability to take decisions, but will not prescribe a separation of functions as a solution. He said: 'If a council is a very dominant provider, it may be very protective about other people coming in to provide a slightly different style of service in a chosen area. 'It may well be with certain kinds of care provided in the community that if the authority sees its prime task as enabling the care to be provided and standing up for those who are going to enjoy the care, that they become even tougher on standards - which would be a good thing. But I don't want to overdo it . . . All I ask is that they get good value for money and think about these issues.' Alongside a strengthened role as enablers over the next four years, councillors may find themselves giving more prominence to debating policy and may also develop a role in scrutinising council efficiency, as the cross-party Commons public accounts committee does for government departments. As ministers have found with local government before, however, a change in the job description is more immediately accomplished than a widespread change in those filling the posts, especially as it is the voters rather than the government who make the appointments.</p>

			<p>920413 FT  13 APR 92 / Arts: Chicago Symphony Orchestra - Royal Festival Hall This mighty engine is being wheeled around Europe for the ninth time, and with all its attachments - for its repertoire for the tour demands maximum forces. Almost anything that Richard Strauss forgot to include in Ein Heldenleben, which we heard on Friday, was enlisted for John Corigliano's First Symphony on Saturday. A comparable army was needed for the bleeding chunks from Gotterdammerung that followed, instead of the popular Ravel pieces originally advertised; but the prospect of Wagner arrangements after Corigliano's long, anguished howl was so rebarbative that I fled. As conducted by Daniel Barenboim, the performance of Ein Heldenleben was technically remarkable. It is rare for so many details of the score, so many middle and lower voices, to stand out with such confident clarity, and yet the orchestral balance was superb. Chicago boasts some of the securest brass in the world - not, perhaps, the warmest (their horns haven't the depth of character of the best German and Austrian teams), but unerringly incisive. The Battle scene was a triumph of organisation. The engine rolled inexorably forward, but left few interpretative traces behind. Except for a good, nasty E-flat clarinet, even the woodwind Critics seemed to be executing a brilliant exercise without much menace. Contrariwise, the violinist Ruben Gonzalez lavished a uniform warmth and virtuosity on his role as Strauss's Pauline, without the petulance and skittishness that the composer mischievously wrote into it. If Barenboim had had more to say about this score, the orchestra would doubtless have transmitted it perfectly; but in the event what we heard was special only for its towering expertise. Beethoven's 'Leonora no. 3' Overture was done in broad strokes, singularly lacking in tension or excitement, except for a dazzling burst of string-scales. About Mozart's G major piano concerto, K. 453, Barenboim as soloist had almost too much to say: a more self-consciously wrought performance would be hard to imagine. Many episodes were extremely pretty; there were also point-making pauses in unwelcome places, and an Andante that suffered by pretending to be an Adagio, and a Finale so deliberate and unspontaneous that even a late acceleration failed to supply the missing fizz. Corigliano's 'Aids' Symphony (as it will inevitably be known) is a strange construction. It is laden with manifestly genuine feeling, by turns angry and desolate, but nearly all the sentiment is 'evoked' by film-music devices  -notably, and constantly, by setting wisps of wistful music (the Albeniz Tango, a little Tarantella by Corigliano himself) over softly dissonant orchestral washes. So far as musical working-out goes, even in the 'twelve-note' Chaconne, there are really no symphonic tensions, just striking colouristic effects. Much of it is affecting, in the manner of a poignant orchestral 'opera'. John Sharp delivered his solo 'cello part with beautiful simplicity; that, indeed, was the main musical event of the work. A 'symphony", however, it is not. Sponsors: Waste Management International and Aon Corporation</p>

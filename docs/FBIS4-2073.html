			<p>BFN     [Text] New Delhi, April 5 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice Foreign  Minister Liu Huaqiu said here today that the diversity of the  Asia- Pacific region should be matched by rich and varied ways  of cooperation.    Speaking at the 50th session of the Economic and Social  Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), which opened here  today, Liu said that all regional economic organizations are  equal. They should respect, open to and complement each other  through enhanced cooperation.    The historical experience over the past 47 years has  demonstrated that the most important contributing factor for the  sustained progress in the Asia-Pacific is the firm seizure of  the historical opportunity to seek progress amidst stability and  facilitate development through reform, Liu stressed.    Over the past year, the Asia-Pacific region has enjoyed  relative political stability, sustained economic growth,  enhanced trading status, strong investment momentum and further  expanded regional cooperation, Liu said.    "While acknowledging the sustained economic growth in the  Asia- Pacific, we should not lose sight of the widening gap  between the North and the South and the serious problem of  uneven development in this region," Liu said. According to  statistics of the Asian Development Bank and ESCAP, the region,  with as many as 800 million people in abject poverty, accounts  for two-thirds of the world's poverty-stricken population, he  said.    In spite of the agreement reached in the Uruguay Round of  GATT talks, trade protectionism, especially that against  developing countries, has been on the rise, posing a threat to  the healthy development of international trade, the Chinese vice  foreign minister added.    As a result of poverty and a shortage of capital and  technology, their infrastructure is mostly inadequate to meet  actual needs and has already become a "bottleneck" or another  constraint seriously impeding their economic and social  development, Liu said, adding that in this sense, to convene a  session on "infrastructure development as key to economic growth  and regional economic cooperation" is very timely and necessary.    With a view to speeding up the infrastructure development  and  cooperation in this region, the Chinese delegation wishes to put  forward the following propositions:    1. Infrastructure development should be tailored to national  conditions.    2. Sources of finance should be explored further in order to  raise funds for infrastructure development.    3. Infrastructure development calls for intensified efforts  to develop human resources.    4. The international community and the developed countries  in  particular, should give vigorous support to infrastructure  development.    5. Infrastructure development requires extensive regional  cooperation.    "We stand ready to have closer cooperation with others", Liu  further said. "We hope to see China's reentry into GATT as  contracting party at an earlier date, which will further promote  trade and economic cooperation on the basis of equality and  mutual benefit," he added.</p>

			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Talks on how to mollify France WITH three days remaining until crucial EC-US talks on a trade liberalisation agreement in the Uruguay Round under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), senior officials in Brussels are focusing on how to overcome French opposition to potential European concessions on agriculture. Last night, Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission President, was holding talks with Mr Jean-Pierre Soisson, France's new farm minister, and Mr Frans Andriessen, the EC commissioner responsible for external affairs, in a move seen as trying to co-ordinate a clear EC bargaining position ahead of the weekend talks. One tactic gaining high-level support side the European Commission is to stress the huge benefits for France in the services sector if a Gatt deal was reached. Mr Andriessen, one of the EC's lead negotiators in the weekend talks, said yesterday that France was 'very competitive' in services. It was important not to focus solely on the agriculture sector, however politically sensitive, he said. The weekend talks in Brussels will cover all disputed areas, including farm exports, services and market access. An outline deal would have to embrace a 'set of elements' which could be wrapped into a single package to be negotiated in detail by the end of the year, EC officials said. In a little-noticed speech this year, Mr Delors made such a link. He asked rhetorically if France could accept a reduction of FFr2bn (Pounds 235m) in cereals exports, if it could export FFr5bn in industrial goods and FFr2bn in services, if the Uruguay Round were completed. The weekend talks, which begin on Sunday and may stretch into Monday, include Mr Andriessen, Mrs Carla Hills, US trade representative, Mr Ray MacSharry, EC farm commissioner, and Mr Ed Madigan, US agriculture secretary. The biggest obstacles are how far payments to EC farmers in compensation for big price cuts agreed in the recent Common Agricultural Policy reform should be exempt from cuts under the Uruguay Round 'final act'; how far the EC must cut its subsidised farm exports, and the amount of subsidy; and how to ensure a 'peace accord', whereby the US agrees to forgo future retaliation against what it considers unfair competition. Mr Andriessen said yesterday he had a clear mandate from the Council of Ministers meeting this week in Luxembourg to negotiate, even if it meant taking some risks. 'The risk not to succeed is more dangerous than the risk of succeeding,' he said.</p>

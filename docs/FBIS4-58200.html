			<p>BFN     [Text] The Popular Front for the Liberation of  Palestine-General Command [PFLP-GC], Jordan region, has issued a  statement in which it responded to a previous statement issued  by one of the fronts' leaders in Amman, Mustafa Khamis,  announcing his split from the front. The front's statement  says: We pity and feel deep sorrow for our brother and comrade,  Mustafa, because of his recent psychological and nervous  deterioration. Therefore, we attach no importance whatsoever to  the contents of that statement, the whole issue is considered an  idle talk and an object of mockery.    Despite this, the lengthy statement says that Khamis suffers  from a superiority complex and psychological trouble, and that  this was caused when he was arrested in 1967 by the Zionist  enemy and was exposed, like other strugglers, to brutal torture,  which he could not stand because of its fierceness and his weak  metal state.    The front says that Khamis rejected the logic of financial  rationing and accountability and insisted on improvised and  secret accounts.    Concluding, the statement says that all this expresses an  incoherent personality and deep changes in his awareness and  behavior. The front's statement, however, asserts that brother  Mustafa was one of the nationalists of whom the front was proud.</p>

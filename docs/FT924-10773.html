			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / Survey of Hungary (8): Running into resistance - Privatisers find the going tougher with fewer deals taking place HUNGARY'S slog to free its economy from smothering state ownership, never an easy one at the best of times, is coming to a vexing juncture. Privatisation started earlier and has gone faster and further than anywhere else in eastern Europe, but now it is decelerating, with the government a way off from its goals of pulling half of the economy out from under the state by 1994 and creating a Hungarian property-owning class to underpin political stability. Few deals have grabbed the headlines since the spring when the State Property Agency, the privatisation authority, sold NMV, the vegetable oil and detergent company, to Ferruzzi and Unilever for Dollars 110m. Moreover, the finance ministry forecasts that privatisation proceeds, which usually lag announcements by several months and reached a record rate of Ft55.8bn in the first eight months of this year, will now decline. The uncomfortable truth is that, after disposing of only about a tenth of the state's commercial holdings, privatisation is suffering from exhaustion. The authorities are running low on those rare jewels of the state sector that sell themselves, on cash investors to buy the rest and, most critically of all, on support from the population for the whole business. Hungary's privatisers are finding the going harder because they started with the best of their portfolio and are now working downwards. So Tungsram, the light bulb maker and one of the few Hungarian industrial companies with market share in western Europe, was the first large company to go, to General Electric of the US in 1990. Since then western multinationals have driven Hungarian privatisation by snapping up consumer goods businesses with a franchise on the market they prize far more than production facilities. Cigarettes, distilling, brewing, vegetable oil, sugar, confectionary and bread industries are largely 'done', as the investment bankers put it. The consumer goods companies that remain are perishable and perishing quickly. Firstly, western multinationals are in a hurry to carve out market share before their competitors and lose interest. Secondly, a state company's market share - and thus its value - generally wilts quickly under western competition. One casualty of this phenomenon has been Caola, the Hungarian personal-care products company, which has failed to attract a western bidder since Colgate-Palmolive withdrew out of impatience last year. It is as if privatisation was separating out the Hungarian economy: the dregs are collecting at the bottom. Western investors take over the best companies in a sector, make them stronger both technically and financially, and force the weakest competitors against the wall. The middle ground, companies which have neither been privatised nor bankrupted, gets narrower all the time, and so the room for privatisation. There remain good buys such as Matav, the telecommunications company, and the regional gas distributors, which have western investors swarming around. But the utilities take time to privatise because thorough regulation is a prerequisite. There are, at the same time as fewer companies to sell, also fewer bidders. Western multinationals, their earnings under pressure in an international slowdown, are not in an acquisitive mood. The SPA says that is reflected more in the number of bidders than in the price. But that is a problem too, because privatisation officials are obliged to sell under competitive conditions and transactions are much more difficult to justify if there is just one serious offer. Nor have Hungarians, in the middle of economic depression, taken up the running. Both institutional investors, what few exist, and small investors have steered clear of equity. The irony is that, just as the western interest which has driven Hungarian privatisation is slackening, resentment of foreign economic domination is stirring. Polls show that the margin of support for privatisation is dangerously thin and the view that Hungary is selling itself out is gaining circulation. The surprise should be that it has taken so long. After all, privatisation is associated, however unfairly, with lay-offs which have taken unemployment to 11.4 per cent and foreign buyers account for about 85 per cent of privatisation sales. The 160 of Hungary's 2,000 state companies which have gone to foreigners have a higher profile - shoppers confront their brands every day on the shelves - and higher value than the simple numbers suggest. Moreover, Hungary's conservative government is ever more sensitive to popular feeling on privatisation as it approaches elections in 1994 which the polls say it would lose. Mr Vaclav Klaus's victory in the Czech election on the back of a popular privatisation programme has set Hungarian policy makers thinking. The challenge to the strategists at the State Property Agency (SPA) is to refashion privatisation to go down better both with investors and voters. Hungary needs a dose of popular, homegrown privatisation. The SPA is taking a first stab by reviving public offerings with the launch of Pick Salami, a prosperous producer of Hungary's spicy sausage. The issue is likely to be priced low, at a price-earnings ratio of about six, and small investors will receive added incentives. But brokers say that cash demand for shares is so thin that a marketing dream such as Pick is troubled. That reveals the danger that subsequent share issues, which would not in any case be so appealing, could flop. The hard core of the challenge remains how to sell companies with no worth to investors with no spare cash. The SPA's response is to hand out 'chips' so that local investors can play the privatisation game, says Mr Les Nemethy, the SPA's deputy managing director in charge of transactions. One part of this is to let investors 'buy on the installment plan'. But many are beginning to realise that even this will not be enough and the effect is to cause Hungarian policy makers to go back to basic principles. Mass distribution of companies which linger in state control, an idea for long rejected out of hand, is now at the top of the agenda. The authorities plan to embark next year on a scheme owing much to Czechoslovakia's voucher privatisation, says Mr Tamas Szabo, Hungary's privatisation minister. The new initiative represents a dramatic departure for Hungary's privatisers, who have until now set themselves against distribution of state property, so much so that the word 'voucher' remains taboo. 'We won't use the word voucher,' says Mr Szabo, admitting at the same time that the new scheme would present 'a similar picture from the outside as the Czech'. Hungary's preferred term is 'credit-note'.</p>

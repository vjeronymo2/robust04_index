			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / S Koreans quit ruling party ELEVEN senior officials of the Democratic Liberal party (DLP) quit yesterday in the latest indication that South Korea's ruling party could disintegrate just two months before the country's presidential election. The defections are part of a growing revolt within the DLP against the party's presidential nominee, Mr Kim Young-sam, a former opposition leader who joined the DLP in 1990. The exodus of other party members, including MPs, is expected this week after the resignation last weekend of Mr Park Tae-joon, party co-chairman and leader of the majority faction. The dissident DLP members are likely to form a new political party to challenge Mr Kim Young-sam, who is the current leading candidate, and Mr Kim Dae-jung, leader of the main opposition Democratic party. Dissatisfaction against Mr Kim Young-sam is strong within the DLP majority faction loyal to President Roh Tae-woo. They resent the growing power of Mr Kim, who commands only a minority of the party's members. But some Roh faction members are disturbed that a DLP split could deliver the election to Mr Kim Dae-jung, and they are urging party unity. The new party being discussed by the former DLP members may nominate Mr Park as their presidential candidate or Mr Kang Young-hun, a former military general who served under President Roh as prime minister.</p>

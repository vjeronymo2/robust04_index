			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / 'Third of women workers' low paid As many as 4m women - more than one third of female workers - earn less than two-thirds of median male weekly earnings, research published today by the Equal Opportunities Commission shows. In a survey of low pay based on data from the Social Change and Economic Life Initiative and the British Household Panel Study, the report predicted that 30,000 additional low-paid jobs would be created by the year 2000. These would mostly be in the part-time service sector where women traditionally find work. The survey also reported that women earn 79.5 per cent of men's wages on average. Women who are low paid are likely to have few, if any, educational qualifications, work part-time in semi-skilled or unskilled jobs, have limited full-time work experience, and work in small, private sector firms in non-unionised jobs. Low pay appears to have a life-cycle element as there is a high percentage of low pay - 82 per cent - among women under 20 years old. Between the ages of 21 and 30 the proportion drops to 37 per cent to 43 per cent and rises to 47 per cent to 57 per cent as women approach retirement age. Cohabiting women have the lowest percentages of low pay, while divorced, separated and widowed women have a slightly lower incidence of low pay than married women. The survey found a correlation between education and pay. Only 10 per cent of women with degrees or teaching qualifications are low paid while 68 per cent of those without qualifications are low paid. The report suggested several causes for low pay. These include the lack of access to training and education combined with gaps in affordable childcare, the concentration of women in low-paid sectors of employment, gender definitions of men and women's skills resulting in lower status for women and the absence of a statutory minimum wage. Ms Clare Short, Labour's shadow minister for women, said: 'This is confirmation of what the Labour Party has been saying - that the government's deregulation of the labour market is leading to millions being trapped in low pay and on benefits - and the majority of them are women.'</p>

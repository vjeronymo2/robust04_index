			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Government Bonds: Gilts stage sharp rally in wake of PSBR reduction Most of the action in Europe's bond markets took place in the gilts market which rallied sharply on the back of Chancellor Kenneth Clarke's 1994-95 Budget. The biggest boost to gilts came from the announcement of a cut in next year's Public Sector Borrowing Requirement and the larger than expected cut in spending. The long-dated gilt future rallied about 1 1/2 point to 116 29/32 . The Bank of England announced the terms of next Wednesday's auction of Pounds 3bn of 6.75 per cent gilts due 2004. On a when-issued partly-paid basis the paper was trading at 50 7/8 in late dealings, yielding some 6.63 per cent, one trader said. German government bonds drifted lower in lacklustre trade. With many operators lying low ahead of tomorrow's meeting of the Bundesbank's Central Bank Council and many investors sidelined so close to the year-end, volume was moderate and trading trendless. 'Much of the volume in the futures pits came from roll-overs into the March from the December (bund) contract,' said a Frankfurt futures dealer. The December bund futures contract closed at 99.91, down 0.06 point from Tuesday. The Bundesbank's announcement of 14-day fixed-rate securities repurchase agreements at 6.25 per cent for today's allocation had little market impact as it was widely expected and was seen to have neutral policy implications for Thursday's Bundesbank meeting. French bonds drifted lower for most of the day in line with bunds, but recovered in late trade on jobless data that reignited hopes for near-term easing by the Bank of France. However, many traders still do not expect the French central bank to cut rates independently of the Bundesbank. The notional bond future on Matif ended 0.34 point lower at 124.00 but jumped in after-hours trading to 124.18. After tumbling by more than a point during the session, Italian bonds recovered from earlier lows towards the close and traders said the possibility of a a deal between the government and opposition on the budget could lift prices today. The BTP futures contract on Liffe closed at 111.75, down 0.81 point from Tuesday. Japanese bonds continued their rally following weak economic data and suggestions by Bank of Japan governor Yasushi Mieno that further monetary easing could be needed if the economy were to decline further. The three-month certificate of deposit rate fell to a record low of 2.22 per cent, down from 2.23 per cent on Monday. The yield on six-month treasury bills fell to 1.67 per cent from 1.78 per cent, crossing the 1.75 per cent official discount rate for the first time. Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark JBG No 157 dropped to a low of 3.275 per cent, the lowest in more than five years. US Treasury bond prices moved sharply lower yesterday as fresh evidence of improving economic conditions served to exacerbate fears of mounting inflationary pressures. In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was down 15/16 at 99 9/32. The yield, rose to 6.298 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was 1/8 lower at 100 1/32, to yield 4.217 per cent. As the trading session began, a mood of nervous anticipation was evident. Crude oil prices, which fell to a three-year low on Monday, had started to recover some ground. However, the focus of bond traders was set squarely on this first of a batch of reports this week which are expected to show the US economy picking up strength in the fourth quarter. The first bad news came when the Conference Board said its index of consumer confidence had jumped to 71.2 this month, compared with a reading of about 60 forecast by analysts. The second - and perhaps most disturbing - report was the November index of business activity from the Purchasing Management Association of Chicago, which showed one of the biggest gains in the survey's 25-year history.</p>

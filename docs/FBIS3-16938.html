			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Women Block Flights"] </F>   [Text] Something extraordinary has occurred in the Air  Defense Troops' air regiment on the island of Sakhalin. Wives  of officers and ensigns went onto the runway and started  blocking flights. The cause of this was a chronic lack of money  -- the 1egiment's servicemen have not been paid since January.    Colonel Semen Romanenko, deputy chief of the Air Defense  Troops Financial and Economic Directorate, told an ITAR-TASS  correspondent that money has today been transferred to the Far  Eastern servicemen for a specific purpose. In his opinion,  however, the question of money to pay servicemen and to finance  the Air Defense Troops has not been resolved as a whole.  Special concern is aroused by the debt of 18 billion rubles [R]  in respect of Moscow Regional Power Administration accounts.  This organization is warning of the possible disconnection of  the Central Command Post and other important installations which  ensure Russia's national security.    Col. Romanenko blames the disastrous situation with regard  to  funding the Air Defense Troops' Far Eastern units on a shortfall  of R2 billion compared with the planned provision. The  ITAR-TASS correspondent managed to ascertain from the Russian  Federation Ministry of Defense that not only the families of  Sakhalin servicemen are suffering from a lack of money. In  February one-fourth of Russia's servicemen did not receive their  pay, and there will be still more in March.</p>

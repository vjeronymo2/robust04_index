			<p><P> July 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENTS: A GUIDE TO THE BEST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA;  </P> <P> GARDENS;  </P> <P> WEDDINGS AND WANDERINGS  </P> <P> STARTED in 1920 and completed in the '40s, the adobe house at Orcutt Ranch is  now a popular site for weddings. But it's the small botanical garden -- eight  acres of an eclectic mix of monkey puzzle, bamboo, huge ancient live oak (one  is 700 years old, another a teen-ager of 350) and sycamore trees, winding  paths, a creek, stone otter gargoyles and a grassy picnic area -- that's the  real treat. Historical tours are conducted on the last Sunday of each month  between 2 and 5 p.m.  </P> <P>  Orcutt Ranch Horticulture Center, 23600 Roscoe Blvd., West Hills; (818)  883-6641.

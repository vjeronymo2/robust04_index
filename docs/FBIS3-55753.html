Chernovil also emphasized that "principles of Ukraine's  nuclear policy were determined by parliament during the  ratification of the START-I treaty with certain reservations."  In Chernovil's words, "all leaders of the country, including the  president, must adhere to this course."    "If Kravchuk signs an agreement on nuclear weapons during  his meeting with Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin on January 14 in  Moscow, it will have no juridical force," believes Chernovil.    Valentin Lemish, chairman of the parliamentary commission on  defense and security, told journalists on Monday that the  agreement to be signed by the three presidents in Moscow is  subject for ratification by the Ukrainian parliament. According  to Lemish, "if the agreement is in line with the parliament  resolution on ratification of the START-I treaty, we shall have  no questions."</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Change to Specifications for Use of Symbol  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based on the weight of the comments received, NHTSA has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decided to amend the specifications. As amended, States and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal agencies with emergency medical services involvement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are authorized to permit use of the ``Star of Life'' symbol to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alert emergency care providers to medical conditions or to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identify appropriate treatment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The States and Federal agencies then will have the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authority to determine within their respective jurisdictions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the medical conditions ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> diabetes, heart disease, high  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> blood pressure) and the treatments ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  DNR) they wish to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include. The ``Star of Life'' would be used for these purposes,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in accordance with programs established by the State or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal agency. This decision is consistent with many of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments that favored giving States some discretionary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authority to determine the appropriate uses for the ``Star of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Life'' within their borders.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Other Issues Raised  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Many of the comments pointed out that the ``Star of Life''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is currently being used in ways that are not restricted to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``certified'' vehicles and personnel. For example, they stated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the symbol is being used on patient care products, on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> personal items used by EMS personnel, and in logos of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> national, state and local EMS organizations. In addition,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> they alleged that many of the logos use formats that do not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comply with the 1977 specifications. Some of the comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> went so far as to question whether, as a result of such varied  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> uses and formats, the ``Star of Life'' has become generic and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lost its validity as a certification mark.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The commenters who noted that the ``Star of Life'' symbol  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is being used in ways, other than on ``certified'' vehicles and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> personnel, are correct. These uses are appropriate, provided  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> they fall within the scope of the Criteria for the Use of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Star of Life'' Symbol. The criteria that were established in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1977 provided for the symbol to be used not only on ambulances  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and to indicate the location of EMS personnel, but also ``to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identify medical equipment and supplies for installation and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use in .&blank;.&blank;. ambulances;'' ``on EMS personal items such as badges,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lapel pins, plaques, buckles, names plates, etc.;'' ``on printed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> material having direct EMS application such as books,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pamphlets, letterheads .&blank;.&blank;.'' and ``[by] entrepreneurs engaged in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the production of goods or publication of printed material  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> [having direct EMS application].'' As explained below, NHTSA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has made some changes to these criteria in today's notice, but  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in general continues to support these related uses of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Star of Life.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There have been attempts to use the symbol for purposes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that are not EMS-related (such as in connection with furniture  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or automobile repair businesses). When these inappropriate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and unauthorized uses have come to NHTSA's attention, we have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> taken immediate steps to ensure that they do not continue. We  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> strongly disagree that the symbol has become generic or lost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its validity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency recognizes that the ``Star of Life'' is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> currently being used or has been incorporated into the logos  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of some EMS organizations using formats that do not comply  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> strictly with the 1977 specifications. We have decided some  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional flexibility in this area is warranted and have,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> therefore, changed this aspect of the 1977 specifications, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> explained below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some comments suggested that NHTSA, as well as State EMS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Directors, should support additional programs aimed at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> educating the public about the meaning of the ``Star of Life''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> symbol and when and how the symbol is to be used. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments recommended also that efforts to supervise its proper  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use should be increased.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA will continue to take steps against the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inappropriate and unauthorized use of the ``Star of Life''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> symbol of which it becomes aware. We encourage State EMS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Directors, or others in the EMS field, to bring such uses to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the agency's attention. We also encourage State EMS Directors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to educate EMS personnel on the proper use of the symbol, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to educate the public in their respective States on matters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such as how to recognize and when to look for the ``Star of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Life.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter seemed to believe that, since NHTSA owns  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the certification mark to the ``Star of Life,'' the symbol may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be used by NHTSA alone. We believe this comment reflects a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> misunderstanding of the nature of certification marks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Unlike a trade or service mark, which creates for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> owner exclusive rights to use the registered symbol, a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certification mark is owned by one person and used by others.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Such a mark is to be used, for example, to certify quality or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other origin.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The ``Star of Life'' symbol was registered and is owned by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA. NHTSA has authorized its use to certify compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with certain standards (such as compliance by an ambulance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with Federal Specifications or completion by EMS personnel of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate training courses). NHTSA has also authorized its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use on goods employed or in connection with services performed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as part of EMS systems, at the national, State or local level.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Other Changes to Criteria and Specifications <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NHTSA requested comments on whether the agency should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> make other revisions to the criteria and specifications that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were established on September 14, 1977. We received extensive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and thoughtful comments from the National Association of State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EMS Directors (NASEMSD). We have adopted some of the changes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommended by NASEMSD, as well as some additional changes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> based on our own review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many of the criteria have been amended to make them less  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> restrictive. Some of the criteria, particularly those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sections that attempted to detail the appearance of the ``Star  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of Life'' for various uses, have been deleted entirely and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> replaced instead with more general instructions and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> restrictions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

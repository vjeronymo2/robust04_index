			<p><P> September 12, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Northern sections of the West and Midwest got a taste of winter as light snow  fell across higher elevations of the eastern Rockies in Colorado, including up  to half an inch in Woodland Park, Colo. Snow also fell in Minot, N.D.  Low-temperature records were broken or tied in nine cities. Frost or freeze  advisories were issued for much of the Dakotas and Nebraska. In Northern and  Eastern Texas, thunderstorms dumped 2 3/4 inches of rain north of Abilene in  just 90 minutes. Abilene itself reported 3.14 inches of rain while Dallas  received 1.3 inches. The storms produced gusts up to 35 m.p.h. in Waco and  winds that tore off tree limbs in Carlsbad, Tex. Hail fell in Temple and  Jefferson County, Okla. New record low temperature readings included the  26-degree reading in Glasgow, Mont., 1 degree lower than the record for the  date set in 1955, and 27 degrees in Casper, Wyo., where the old mark of 33  degrees was set in 1974.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AUTHOR, AUTHOR: ARTIE SHAW;  </P> <P> THE FORMER SWING ERA BANDLEADER TURNS HIS TALENTS FROM MUSIC TO LITERATURE  </P> <P> Artie Shaw, the lone surviving instrumental giant of the Swing Era, stands in  the sprawling upstairs space of his Newbury Park home that real estate folks  call a "bonus room," holding a large and colorful proclamation from the City of  Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "Everybody in the city government put their name on this," he says with a  subtle hint of levity in his voice. "The weird thing is that they're giving me  an honor for something I stopped doing 35 years ago."  </P> <P> The "something" is what Shaw, a feisty, vital fellow who this Wednesday turns  80 -- but looks 60 -- likes to call "The Artie Shaw Business," referring to the  international celebrity the former clarinetist/bandleader received during the  '30s and '40s.  </P> <P> Shaw insists that when he quit active playing in 1954, he retired from music.  But the "business" follows him around like a ghost, though a fairly benevolent  one. After all, Shaw was, along with Glenn Miller and Benny Goodman, one of the  three most popular instrumentalists of the Swing Era. He has made countless  millions from his music -- his records have sold upwards of 50 million copies  -- and he still gets handsome royalties from the scores of records that are in  release on Bluebird/RCA, Musicmasters and Musiccraft/Discovery labels.  </P> <P> And, since late 1983, he has lent his name to "The Artie Shaw Orchestra,  directed by Dick Johnson." He owns the band and has appeared occasionally with  it, though only as a guest leader, never as a player.  </P> <P> While music pays the bills, Shaw, bald and sporting a bristle-brush mustache,  no longer wishes to be aligned with it: He wants to be known as Artie Shaw,  writer. The once-clarinetist now has had three books published, including the  1952 autobiography "The Trouble With Cinderella: An Outline of Identity"  (DaCapo), the  </P> <P> 1965 novel "I Love You, I Hate You, Drop Dead!" (Fleet) and the 1989 book of  short stories "The Best of Intentions" (John Daniel and Co.). In addition, he's  almost completed a 500-600 page novel.  </P> <P> "I have a special burden as a writer, since people know my name as a musician,"  he says. "We have peculiar categories in America, meaning that if he's a  musician he can't be a good writer. 'Artie Shaw, what's he doing writing?' "  </P> <P> Perhaps if he published more often, or had had more success as a writer, might  people take him more seriously? "Oh, I don't think so," he says pointedly.  "They might, if my name weren't Artie Shaw. But with any name that's well  known, people read that person through a layer of preconceptions. It's surely  true that as a well-known person, it's easier to get published."  </P> <P> John Daniel, who says that "the playfulness and energy of Shaw's writing" were  two reasons he wanted to publish him, agrees that Shaw's celebrity places him  at a disadvantage. "Whether, because of his wealth from his music, he has the  privilege or the luxury of not having to publish, Artie is behind the  eight-ball because nobody will read him just as a writer," he says. "A  brilliant clarinetist, or an ex-husband of the stars (Shaw was briefly married  to Lana Turner and Ava Gardner), that's what they think of first. That's hard  for an artist to put up with. He's had to live with the onus of his success all  the time."  </P> <P> If nothing else, in Shaw's mind, he's a writer. "I've been mainly living as a  writer since about 1950, getting up in the morning, writing for four hours,  etc.," he says, now sitting at his somewhat-cluttered desk in a corner of the  book-lined upstairs room that looks out on his pool, and then, in turn, the  suburbs that are located just north of Thousand Oaks, the Ventura Freeway and  the soft, sloping hills beyond. "Maybe I didn't have any history as a writer  then, but I'd say I do now. I've done three books and I'm working on a fourth."  </P> <P> "Look," Shaw goes on, an edge in his voice. "I come up here and I do it. I  write. I feel compelled to. Why would anybody in his right mind sit down and  write? There's nobody out there clamoring for fine writing. I have a necessity  to do this."  </P> <P> Shaw started his novel-in-progress, currently bearing the working title of "The  Education of Albie Snow," in 1978. Though Shaw says he doesn't like to talk a  book as he's writing it, he does acknowledge that it's about a young reed  player who goes to New York in the late 1920s to seek fame and fortune in the  jazz world. The book stops off when the protagonist Snow is 23 years old, in  the mid-'30s.  </P> <P> The novel, and all of Shaw's writing, he says, is "to some degree  autobiographical. If it's not, it won't deal with the truth, and by that, I  mean what's real to me. We are the sum total of our experiences; if they're  rich, we'll resonate more. I've lived for a long time and I've learned a few  things that I'm passing on. Some will hear it, some will not."  </P> <P> It's a painstaking process, writing a book. "I'm trying to write the most  simple, lucid prose and it's hard to write  </P> <P> simply. . . . I work very, very slowly," he notes.  </P> <P> Then, in one of his frequent asides to offer a quote or anecdote that  illustrates a particular point he wishes to drive home, Shaw reads a quote from  a typed sheet by writer Kurt Vonnegut Jr. The sheet -- somewhat brown with age  -- has been tacked, along with several others by the likes of Paul Gauguin and  Steve Tesich, on a wooden shelf by his desk.  </P> <P> " '(As novelists), our power is patience . . . (writing a novel) is a lot like  inflating a blimp with a bicycle pump. Anyone can do it, all it takes is time.'  Isn't that a gem?"  </P> <P> Mostly self-taught, Shaw has taken a few writing classes, such as one in  creative writing from Columbia University Extension. "They didn't do any good,"  he says. "I thought writing was a matter of how much you knew, but it's about  having to do it. If you don't have that fire in the belly, you won't do  anything."  </P> <P> Though Shaw has no publisher for his novel, he does have an agent, the Scott  Meredith Literary Agency in New York City, which represents such notables as  Norman Mailer, Carl Sagan and Arthur C. Clarke. Jack Scovil, editorial director  at Meredith, is "enthusiastic" both about placing Shaw's book with a large  publishing house, and about Shaw's work in general.  </P> <P> "Based on what he has written in the past, we think he's a marvelous writer,  particularly his dry wit and verbal play," says Scovil. "He's a fascinating man  who can really bring to bear the embodiment of the era . . . he's demonstrated  all of the talents of doing a top-notch novel."  </P> <P> Shaw, whose brown eyes shine with a lively sparkle, has been reading  voraciously since he was 8 and took his first shot at writing a book when he  was 24. He saw it as a way out of the public life of a celebrity that came with  his fame in the music business. "I'm by nature a kind of insulated, private  person and (writing) was something I could do alone, and might be able to make  a living at," he's said.  </P> <P> That hasn't happened yet, and Shaw, to his pleasure, still makes a very good  living from his music. "Hell, that's very gratifying. I'm a hustler. I'll take  the money wherever it is," he cracks, laughing.  </P> <P> Born Arthur Arshawsky in Manhattan in 1910, Shaw was raised in New Haven,  Conn., and left home at 15 -- "I didn't like it there" is all he'll say about  his early departure. He began to work almost immediately and by age 23 was one  of the most in-demand studio musicians in New York. In 1934, he retired to  Bucks County, Pa., to try writing, but soon returned to the music business,  gaining some attention in 1935 with "Interlude in B Flat," a tune he performed  with a small jazz band and a string quartet.  </P> <P> This unusual instrumentation didn't pan out, so Shaw formed a more conventional  big band of saxes, trombones, trumpets and rhythm. In 1938, when he recorded a  Jerry Gray arrangement of Cole Porter's "Begin the Beguine," Shaw struck pay  dirt.  </P> <P> The tune was a smash hit and Shaw became a superstar. "I was Elvis. I was  making $60,000 a week and that was 1938 dollars," he says with a chuckle.  </P> <P> Shaw loved music and was unquestionably a remarkable musician -- in his book  "The Swing Era," Gunther Schuller calls him a "real master of the clarinet,  virtually incomparable in the beauty of his tone and unique in his flawless  control." But he had no affinity for the fame that accompanied his rise to  stardom. "The public is constantly intruding on your privacy. It's something  you don't know will happen until it does, and then you're not prepared for it,"  he says.  </P> <P> Between 1938 and 1954, Shaw quit music several times, for both mental and  physical health reasons. One thing that caused him to quit was that he wanted  to play something new and different, while his public was constantly hungry for  his hits, which included "Frenesi," "Stardust" and "Summit Ridge Drive." "I  could never understand why people wanted to dance to my music," he says. "I  made it good enough to listen to."  </P> <P> He put his clarinet down for the last time -- he still plays a bit of piano,  but not in public -- "because I didn't want to play it anymore -- I wanted to  play this," pointing at his MacIntosh.  </P> <P> Shaw doesn't talk much about music -- he would rather talk about ideas. But  when he does, it's with the same grit and enthusiasm with which he takes on any  subject.  </P> <P> For example, consider the word jazz. "Jazz, what is jazz, what are they talking  about?" he asks with ire. "It's a bad word. I'd rather call it American  Informal Music, as opposed to European Formal Music."  </P> <P> Asked about his supposed rivalry with Benny Goodman, Shaw says, "It's like  trying to compare Picasso and Braque. Benny, who was every bit as dedicated as  I was, wanted to be an instrumentalist -- he was a superb technician -- while I  wanted to be a musician. I think my mind was more complex than his. It  certainly is now," he adds with a robust laugh.  </P> <P> Shaw's tastes run toward European composers, from Mozart and Beethoven to  Schoenberg and Bartok. He does like some "jazz," such as Lester Young and Bix  Beiderbecke, but has little time for boppers like Charlie Parker. "I've heard  enough of that," he says.  </P> <P> What's his reaction when hears one of his hits, like "Begin the Beguine"? "Ho .  . . hum," he says. "That doesn't mean I don't like it or I don't respect it. We  did a very good job at that time. I certainly wouldn't do it that way now."  </P> <P> A typical Shaw day begins at 7 a.m. "First I breathe," he jokes, then he takes  a brisk one-mile walk, then shower, a breakfast of coffee -- "one cup" -- toast  and then work on his book. Later, after lunch, he reads. (He's currently  tackling Richard S. Westfall's "Never at Rest: A Biography of Isaac Newton,"  Bertrand Russell's "A History of Western Philosophy" and David Dunaway's  "Huxley in Hollywood.") Then it's back to the Mac, or maybe a little social  life -- "though I'm pretty antisocial these days. You can't get anything done  unless you are."  </P> <P> Notorious for his eight marriages -- Turner, Gardner, Elizabeth Kern (daughter  of Jerome Kern), Kathleen Windsor (author of "Forever Amber") and Evelyn Keyes,  among them -- Shaw has no patience for the institution. "It's completely  outmoded," he says, but does admit to still liking the ladies.  </P> <P> "I'm seeing one now, and it's working out pretty well," he says. "We're keeping  a journal. That's something new."  </P> <P> Shaw figures an epitaph he gave to Who's Who in America pretty well sums up his  life: "He did the best he could with the material at hand." He smiles  mischievously, then adds, "Another good one would be, 'Go away.' "  </P></p>

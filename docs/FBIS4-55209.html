			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Romanian President Ion Iliescu by </F> unidentified correspondent of the French magazine LE POINT;  place and date not given: "It Is All the Same to Me Who Is Going  To Govern and What Party Will Be Included in the Government"]    [Text] [LE POINT] For quite a while one could notice a  legal reticence to apply to Romania a Western model of market  economy. Are you still reticent about it?    [Iliescu] These are all fabrications. I am not a  simple-minded person. I am not an uneducated person. (...)    These are fabrications that are exploited for political  reasons and can be explained through the internal political  struggle, in which such comments are also made: "Iliescu  belonged to the nomenclature in the 1960's." However, nobody is  talking about the fact that Romania's political opening took  place in the 1960's. Romania was the first and only country that  succeeded in achieving the withdrawal of Soviet troops in 1958.  After that, in the 1960's, a general openness followed with  Romania's firm opposition to Soviet tendencies to achieve the  integration of economies of satellite countries and to submit  them to the Soviet economy. Then came Romania's opposition to  the intervention in Czechoslovakia in 1968. (...) Between 1960  and 1967 I was among those who urged this openness of Romania.  (...)    I have already mentioned that we have three major  adversaries  in the exercise of social life. I am talking about those who  nurture nostalgic feelings for the recent past. This nostalgia  has a reason, namely, there is a certain degree of  dissatisfaction because the social explosion of December 1989  took place precisely as a result of the difficulties of people's  daily life, and conditions have still not improved. On the  contrary: Industrial production has dropped, the international  situation has not been favorable for our economy, and that is  how inflation and unemployment emerged, which are phenomena that  create new problems for people. There is a certain degree of  dissatisfaction. All people hailed democracy, however,  democracy without the improvement of people's living conditions  has no value whatsoever for ordinary people. From this  viewpoint, there are people who ask why, why indeed should we  not recreate the old system that ensured a minimum of security  for us? I say that this is no longer possible, even if there  were people who wished to recreate the old structures,  mechanisms, and institutions. (...) There is another type of  nostalgia: the nostalgia of old people who remember the years  before the war and who want to recreate the old structures of  Romania that existed before the two world wars. This is even  less possible (...).    The third group of "adversaries" are those who are in a  hurry  to get rich. There is much confusion in social and economic  life in this period of changes and transition, because the  authority of state institutions and the authority of the law are  not yet solid and there are many shortfalls from this viewpoint.  Thus, one can see various forms of corruption emerging, such as  a tendency to avoid taxes, and one can also see people who want  to get rich very quickly and people who want to get hold of  power and wealth very quickly. This is a phenomenon to which we  have to pay greatly increased attention. The society has to  find forms of self-defense against such pressure. These are  major problems. As far as I am concerned, I am not connected at  all to the nostalgic people, however, I realize the difficulty  of the process itself. I am a realistic person. I believe that  in the current political situation we must get rid of all  ideological prejudice and take into consideration the new  social, national, and international realities.    [LE POINT] What political formula do you regard as possible  in Romania, especially if we consider the situation you have  just mentioned?    [Iliescu] There are a number of concrete problems that have  to be solved in this period in which the government is a  minority government. We have not had the chance to form a  government of national unity, as I said from the very beginning,  or a certain coalition that would ensure a stable majority. I  even suggested that a political pact should be concluded and it  should follow certain generally accepted principles. I am  referring to principles that are the basis for organizing any  type of government. From this viewpoint, it is all the same to  me who will govern. A certain alternation could even be healthy  for the future political life, because there is a certain  viewpoint when people are in the opposition -- and are  constantly criticizing -- and there is another viewpoint when  they assume responsibility and try to solve problems. (...)  That is why I was very frank when I suggested a national unity  government, however, there were forces that claimed that this is  undemocratic. In this climate of general suspicion there are  people who think: What are Iliescu's goals? He is a dangerous  type, a former nomenclatura member, a skillful politician, he  wants to cheat us! They even affirmed that my idea was an  attempt to stifle the political opposition, but what kind of  democracy can we have when there is no opposition in parliament?    This was the way that they were thinking. Then I said: If  you do not agree with my idea, we must form a coalition. This  was not possible either. The only chance was to form a minority  government with the party that held the most seats in  parliament, that is 34 percent of the seats. There are new  discussions now. As you know, we started negotiations in  December 1993. I tried to find a new platform for dialogue with  all parties, in order to work out a basic platform, a sort of  political pact, in which we could include all points of  consensus. Obviously, there are differences in regarding  political and economic life and economic reform in general.  However, there are some points of general agreement. (...) I  could even say that as far as the idea of economic reform is  concerned, there is a big platform and there are common aspects.  However, there are also differences. In this context, I  proposed that we should find those points that will create a  platform of basic understanding. Now, proceeding from this  idea, it is all the same to me which government will take the  initiative of implementing this platform or what parties will be  included in the respective government. (...)    [LE POINT] Mr. President, several neighboring, former  communist countries in the East today are loudly voicing their  concerns about a new danger of Russian hegemony in Central and  Eastern Europe. What do you think about it and what is your  stand on this issue? Do you also feel a certain apprehension?    [Iliescu] There are obviously some dangers. I believe that  the Russian problem will stay topical for quite a while as one  of the most difficult problems for Europe and for the world  balance. Considering that Russia is still a big country, it will  stay a major power, a country with many economic resources, and  a country with a serious military potential. On the one hand,  there are all these actions to ensure internal balance and  economic stability and to strengthen democratic processes and  democratic forces and, on the other hand, there are the actions  to establish a free and efficient market economy, which is a  much more complicated process for Russia than for other  countries. (...) Thus, it is more difficult there to find  solutions for internal economic, social, and political stability  and to strengthen political forces. In these conditions of  crisis, there is always the danger of the emergence of extremist  tendencies, such as those expressed by Zhirinovskiy and others.  Likewise, there is a certain imperial nostalgia, just as in the  case of all the other countries that played an important role at  a certain time in history. (...) Therefore, from this point of  view, these concerns are real, they exist indeed. However, we  are neighboring countries and we are interested in promoting  good relations. (...)</p>

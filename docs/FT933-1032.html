			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Markets: Hays delivers the goods - The Bottom Line THE market value of Hays, the business services group, has recently climbed through the Pounds 1bn barrier - not bad for a company which was floated with a capitalisation of Pounds 393m in late 1989, just before the UK economy moved into recession. Investors have become very disenchanted with groups such as BET, which boasted that business services were 'recession-resistant' - only for their results to collapse when the economy really did turn down. However, Hays has substantially outperformed the market, as the chart shows. One reason is that it is among the small group of companies which provide contract distribution, through dedicated warehouses and transport fleets, to leading retailers such as Sainsbury and Marks and Spencer. Ronnie Frost, Hays' forceful executive chairman, argues that recession can help even his group, as it forces companies to put out to contract activities which they were content to do themselves when profits were not under threat. Frost says this happened in the UK and has also been demonstrated recently in France, where Hays last year bought Fril, a national distributor for Pounds 37.5m. He believes the same process will occur in Germany as recession bites, hence the group's acquisition in July of Mordhorst, a Kiel-based national distributor, for an initial Pounds 32m. Not all of Hays' activities have responded so well to recession. Operating profits from the personnel business, which specialises in recruiting accountancy staff, plunged from Pounds 19m in 1990 to a mere Pounds 4.8m two years later. News that personnel's operating profits had improved by 40 per cent to Pounds 6.7m in the year to June 30 was one factor behind the enthusiastic reception given to the group's annual results this week. Having slashed employee numbers in personnel from 1,500 to 850 by the end of last year, Frost says 75 per cent of any increase in turnover will drop straight through to the profits line. Analysts also admire niche businesses such as Britdoc, the group's overnight letters business, which won many new customers, including four clearing banks, during the year to June. Britdoc charges 66 per cent of the first-class letter rate, so automatically benefits from any Post Office increase. Hays might suffer if the arrival of discount retailers in the UK leads to a price war that undermines the high profit margins enjoyed by UK food retailers, which have long been the envy of their European counterparts. The group would initially benefit from any increase in volumes caused by a price war, but would seem likely to suffer in the longer term if a less profitable environment causes retailers to re-examine their costs. Hays has already started to seek more industrial distribution contracts, but believes that its recent acquisitions will allow it to offer pan-European distribution facilities to customers such as Seagrams, the Canadian drinks group, and Moet Hennessy, LVMH's champagne and brandy business. Hays does have cyclical businesses within the group. The distribution of bulk chemicals has suffered from a drop in margins which will only recover when the UK climbs out of recession - a process which Frost this week warned 'looks as if it will be long and slow.' Frost talks with evangelistic zeal about the group's businesses and his downbeat view of the UK recovery seemed to be aimed at forestalling previous criticism by analysts that Hays has been guilty in the past of not quite delivering on expectations it raised. It should be said that the same analysts give Frost credit for having established a strong management team, and were impressed by his view that Hays was capable of doubling the size of its business over the next few years. Given the company's track record, it is no surprise that Hays shares are currently trading on a 20 per cent premium to the market. That rating limits the scope for short-term advance, but the shares do not look expensive on a long-term view, given the quality of the businesses and the potential of its pan-European distribution strategy.</p>

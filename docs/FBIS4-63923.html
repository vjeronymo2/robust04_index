			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksandr Veklich report: "Defense Sector on Its Knees"] </F>   [Text] Novosibirsk -- Sixteen of the largest enterprises  in Novosibirsk Oblast have closed down either partially or  completely. While carefully fulfilling state orders and  retaining the mobilization capacity required for them, the  Novosibirsk defense sector has still not received payments of 41  billion rubles due to it from the budget.    According to Anatoliy Yakovlev, chief of the Novosibirsk  Oblast Administration's Machine Building and Defense Sectors of  Industry Department, around 70 appeals have been sent to top  organs of power. So far they have met with silence. Enterprise  trade unions are planning a protest for 9 June.</p>

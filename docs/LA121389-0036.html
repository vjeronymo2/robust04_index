			<p><P> December 13, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: E.GERMAN SPORTS OFFICIALS QUIT  </P> <P> The leadership of East Germany's embattled sports federation resigned Tuesday  in response to mounting public criticism of excessive government support of  elite athletes.  </P> <P> President Klaus Eichler, his five vice presidents and the entire secretariat  quit the German Gymnastics and Sports Federation (DTSB) in an emergency session  at the Kienbaum training camp east of Berlin.  </P> <P> Delegates charged that federation leaders were looking out for their own posts  and urged that more attention be paid to local sports.  </P> <P> Since East Germany's peaceful democratic revolt, former star athletes have come  under criticism for enjoying privileges. Pressure has increased for funding  more sports facilities for the public and promoting sports previously deemed  secondary by officials, such as tennis, basketball and hockey.  </P> <P> With their status endangered, top athletes have called for sports leadership to  utilize commercial sponsors.  </P> <P> A statement signed by 192 athletes, including Olympic shotput champion Ulf  Timmermann, called on the leadership to resign, saying that it was unable to  lead the organization at a time of rapid change in society.  </P> <P> Premier Hans Modrow met Monday with athletes and officials. Modrow said he  wanted to maintain the respected place of competitive sports but stressed that  "much more attention must be paid to sports for all."  </P></p>

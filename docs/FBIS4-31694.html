			<p>BFN     [Text] An ethnic purge is fully under way in the cultural  and economic fields and in the executive power in the Kurdzhali  region; this is a deliberate line being followed by the Rights  and Freedoms Movement [DPS]. Stefan Stefanov, National Assembly  deputy for the Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP], made this  statement this evening at a news conference in Kurdzhali. He  cited dozens of examples of leading Bulgarian officials being  replaced by DPS activists lacking the necessary professional  qualities. According to the BTA report, Stefan Stefanov  tomorrow will brief the BSP parliamentary group on the  activities of the DPS in the region and will demand a meeting  with Interior Minister Viktor Mikhaylov.</p>

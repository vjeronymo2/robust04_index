			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / Fine art salerooms report fallin sales SOTHEBY'S and Christie's, the world's two largest fine art auctioneers, yesterday announced their sales figures for the 1991-92 season, which is just ending. They reveal a further decline in turnover, but clear signs that the recession in the art market is bottoming out. Sotheby's reported sales of Dollars 1.14bn (Pounds 640m), a fall, in dollar terms, of 15 per cent over the previous season. Christie's sales totalled Pounds 609m (Dollars 1.082bn), 8 per cent down on 1990-91. A year ago, both salerooms were recording reductions in turnover of almost 60 per cent compared with 1989-90. As the market has contracted, rivalry between the two companies has intensified. Sotheby's, based in New York, is reluctant to break down regional turnovers and variations during the season. Christie's, based in London, is keen to publicise that since last January its sales, at Pounds 336m, show a 6 per cent rise on the same period in 1991. Sotheby's has confirmed that it, too, has done better this year, with sales 5.8 per cent ahead of 1991. Christie's also maintains that its share of the market is rising to its highest level since the mid 1950s. It claims 49 per cent, up from 48 per cent in 1990-91. It has, however, included private treaty sales in this figure, in particular the net price of Pounds 10m it secured by selling Holbein's portrait of a 'Lady with a Squirrel' to the National Gallery in London. Without private treaty sales, Sotheby's probably still holds about 52 per cent of the auction market. The feature of the season has been the decline in the importance of Impressionist and Modern art and the resurgence of Old Master paintings as the key market, closely followed by furniture and jewels. Phillips, the third in size of the London auction houses, has reported sales of Pounds 85.3m for the season, a fall of 3 per cent on the year.</p>

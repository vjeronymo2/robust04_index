			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / UK Company News: BM selling Blackwood Hodge parts to Imaco BM GROUP, the construction equipment and engineering concern, has sold the UK and Spanish parts of Blackwood Hodge, the international distributor which it took over in September 1990. BM's share price plummeted last summer after the sudden departure through ill health of Mr Roger Shute, its chairman . Mr Howard Sutton, chief executive, said yesterday the group was seeking to sell some peripheral or loss-making businesses. He denied rumours that BM Plant was being sold to its management. The buyer of Blackwood Hodge UK and Spain, plus two other small subsidiaries, is International Machinery Company. Its chief executive is Mr Gordon Brown, one of the three Yorkshire brothers who built up Brown Group International, which went into receivership in June 1990 with debts of about Pounds 80m. Mr Brown launched Imaco with the purchase of some of Brown Group's construction equipment operations from the receiver. Its annual turnover will be more than doubled by the sales of more than Pounds 20m brought in through the purchases from BM. Imaco, based in Wetherby, gained a franchise to sell Terex dump trucks last year, taking it into competition with Blackwood Hodge UK. It also distributed Samsung excavators and wheeled loaders.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Two untitled, unattributed reports on election scene in </F> Ukraine]    [Text] A sensational publication from a yet to be  published book by Vitaliy Masol, the newly elected head of  Ukraine's government, has appeared on the eve of the elections.  The author paints a rather unappealing portrait of his protege  [as published]. Masol says that none other than President  Kravchuk masterminded the introduction of the  "governor-generals" [namestniki] institute which caused  confusion and, in effect, dual power in the regions. None other  than the president guaranteed: Deposits in the Savings Bank will  be reliably protected. Owing to inflation, however, millions of  people were robbed only a few months later. "Fraud,  manipulation of public opinion, and thinly disguised graft are  widely used by Kravchuk to shore up his shaky positions,"  remarks V. Masol. [first report ends]    The republic committee of the Communist Party of Crimea  points out in its statement that the most reactionary circles at  the present time are pooling their efforts and openly speak in  support of the candidacy of the current head of state L.  Kravchuk. This poses a real threat to Ukraine because it leads  to preserving the course toward self-isolation, nationalist  restriction, and deepening degradation of society.    The republic committee of the Communist Party of Crimea in  this connection pledges its support to Leonid Kuchma. Factors  in Kuchma's favor are the provisions of his election program, in  particular the demand for an urgent search for ways toward  economic integration with Russia and the other CIS republics and  giving Russian the status of a second state language. It is  precisely for this reason that the Communist Party of Crimea  calls upon all communists and all the voters to vote for Leonid  Kuchma on 26 June.</p>

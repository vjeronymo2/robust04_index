			<p>BFN     [Text] The all-African peacekeeping force has called on a  group calling itself the Liberian Peace Council [LPC] to  unconditionally declare a cease-fire and allow deployment of  peacekeeping troops within its territory. Both ECOMOG [Economic  Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group]  and the UN Observer Mission in Liberia, at a meeting with LPC  representatives, repeated calls to the group to stop all  hostilities in the southeast of the country without  preconditions.    Recently, LPC leader, (George Kpolley) announced that the  LPC  is willing to cooperate with ECOMOG in disarming its fighters,  but stressed that security must be provided for LPC fighters  before deployment of ECOMOG troops.</p>

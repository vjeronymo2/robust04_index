			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / International Company News: Lauritzen Shipping chief executive quits Mr Peter Weitermeyer, chief executive of J. Lauritzen Shipping since 1986, resigned with immediate effect yesterday. No reason for the resignation was given. Lauritzen Shipping made a pre-tax loss of DKr289m (Dollars 45m) in the first half of this year, following losses of DKr183m in 1992 and DKr465m in 1993. Lauritzen Holding, which includes a shipyard and several marine-related manufacturing companies, made a first-half loss of DKr198m and a 1993 loss of DKr179m. The shipping company operates one of the world's largest fleets of refrigerated cargo vessels, where freight rates have been hit by the weak dollar and the European Union's quota restrictions on banana imports from South America. Freight rates for the group's fleet of small gas tankers have been weak. Mr Claus V. Ipsen, formerly the shipping company's finance manager, takes over from Mr Weitermeyer.</p>

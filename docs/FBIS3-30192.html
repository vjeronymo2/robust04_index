It has exported almost  30,000 tons of Ilmenite. In particular, in August 1993, the  corporation exported 22,800 tons, 80 percent of the 1993 plan.  The ilmenite ore found in Ha Tinh has a high content, and there  are large reserves. Thus, the corporation should be able to  attract many customers. In 1994, the corporation hopes to export  60-80,000 tons with ore grading systems at the mines able to  handle 120,000 tons.    In the past, because mining operations were not organized,  damage was done to the environment. Today, the Austinh  Corporation is using new techniques and purchasing ore only from  individuals extracting ore from within designated zones. As a  result, the above situation has been overcome.    Austinh is the economic spearhead of Ha Tinh. During the 3  months the corporation has been in operation, revenues have  exceeded $3 million, more than 1 billion dong has been paid into  the budget, $15,000 has been contributed to the people of Ha  Tinh, 12 beds have been contributed to the provincial hospital,  and 100 million dong has been invested to repair roads and  bridges and help three villages build schools.</p>

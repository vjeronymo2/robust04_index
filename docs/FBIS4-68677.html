			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by V. Snisarenko: "Tyumen Oblast Gets Its Duma"] </F>   [Text] It is specifically a duma, since according to  the proposal of the organizational committee the deputies were  offered two names for the supreme representative body of state  power in Tyumen Oblast--the oblast duma or the legislative  assembly. The deputies chose the oblast duma by a majority of  votes.    And now let us proceed in order. The meeting of the oblast  supreme body was called to order by the chairman of the  organizational committee, A. Kayumov. All 17 elected deputies  were present, along with the head of the oblast administration  L. Roketskiy, his deputies, representatives of the  Yamalo-Nenetsk and Khanty-Mansi Okrugs, the representative of  the RF [Russian Federation] President, G. Shcherbakov, members  of the former oblast Minor Soviet, and representatives of the  mass media and the trade union organs.    Prior to the election of the chairman of the Tyumen Oblast  Duma, the meeting was conducted by Deputy S. Kirichuk.    On its first day of work, the duma heard the report of A.  Zhikharev, chairman of the oblast electoral commission.    The duma ratified the temporary regulations of the  representative body of state power for Tyumen Oblast, the  Statute on the Representative Body of Oblast Power--the Oblast  Duma.    After the recess, the deputies undertook a review of the  most  interesting question on the agenda--the election of the oblast  duma chairman and his deputies.    We must note that the proposal presented by Deputy A.  Korelyakov to elect the duma chairman on a non-fulltime basis  and to reduce the technical apparatus of the oblast duma to a  proportion of one to one, with the number of apparatus workers  equalling the number of deputies, was rejected.    However, another proposal presented by this same deputy was  passed--that of introducing an amendment to Article 4 of the  Statute on the Representative Body of State Power in Tyumen  Oblast--the Oblast Duma. This amendment stated that a deputy has  the right to obtain any information in the oblast and federal  organs of executive power and the ability to bring this  information to his voters.    By the results of the fourth round of voting, Nikolay  Pavlovich Baryshnikov, the deputy head of administration of  Khanty-Mansi Okrug, was elected chairman of the Tyumen Oblast  Duma.    At the suggestion of the new chairman of the oblast duma,  Vladimir Nikolayevich Tretyakov was elected as his deputy.    A detailed account of the first day's work will be presented  in the next issue.</p>

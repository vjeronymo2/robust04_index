The  dissident said in a phone conversation from Shanghai that the  19-point petition had been sent to the National People's  Congress (NPC) last Friday.    Entitled "Blueprint for the political democratisation of the  state and society in 1994," the petition was signed by 54 people  "from all walks of life in Shanghai -- intellectuals, academics,  artists, peasants, workers and private businessmen," Bao said.  The names includes those of Yang Zhou, Wang Fucheng and Li  Guotao, prominent Shanghai dissidents, he said.    "It is the first signature campaign, and we are going to  extend the movement nationwide," he said.</p>

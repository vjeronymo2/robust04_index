			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / Need for a US lead: Clinton cannot escape the Iraqi and Bosnian crises Friends and allies should not complain about the new US president's wish to give America's domestic problems priority. If those problems are not dealt with, it will soon be vain to hope for continued US leadership in the wider world. But US leadership remains indispensable, even after the cold war. That was demonstrated both positively and negatively in 1991. Without US leadership, the Gulf war would never have been fought. Kuwait would be still in Saddam Hussein's clutches, and he would by now have a nuclear weapon. And without US leadership, Europe was unable to prevent genocidal war in the former Yugoslavia, where the US decided it had no strategic interest. Mr Bill Clinton takes office in the midst of renewed hostilities against Iraq, and at the moment when a Munich-like capitulation is being imposed on Bosnia-Hercegovina. Both crises call for new thinking and bold measures. Continuity and containment will not suffice. Last week the then president-elect told The New York Times that, if Mr Saddam wanted a new relationship with the US, 'all he has to do is change his behaviour' to comply with UN requirements. Later he explained this did not mean there was any difference between his policy and that of his predecessor, or that he would normalise relations as long as Mr Saddam was in power. It meant only that Mr Saddam could avoid being bombed if he did not violate the UN ceasefire accords. Normal relations between the US and Mr Saddam's government are indeed scarcely imaginable, after all that has happened. The danger is that Iraq may simply be left to stew, simultaneously terrorised by Mr Saddam's vicious repressive apparatus and starved by economic sanctions. It is not to be supposed that Mr Saddam would content himself with such malign neglect. He would go on pursuing his objectives in the south with 'indiscriminate bombardments and destruction of local marsh villages and hamlets, resulting in innumerable arrests and deaths', as the UN's special rapporteur for human rights in Iraq reported to the General Assembly two months ago. Mr Saddam would go on intimidating the Kurds in the north with terrorism, blockade and sabotage, while playing on the fears of neighbouring states that the west's real aim is to partition Iraq and set up an independent Kurdish state. He would go on taunting and provoking the US with new ceasefire violations, so as to win sympathy from other Moslems and Arab nationalists when the inevitable retaliation arrived; and would alternate this with carefully timed pledges of good behaviour, in return for the lifting of sanctions and restoration of his control over the whole country. Mr Clinton must not be a sitting target for those tactics. He must expose Saddam's phoney David-and-Goliath act by exposing him as the real Goliath. That means indicting him and his leading henchmen for crimes against humanity; transferring Iraq's property abroad to his democratic opponents in the Iraqi National Congress; abandoning the UN-Iraq agreement which makes relief for Saddam's victims dependent on his government's goodwill; ordering and enforcing the withdrawal, not only of anti-aircraft missiles but of any and all forces that attack Iraqi civilians or prevent supplies from reaching them - starting with the 450 troops at Faida, well north of the 36th parallel, which have been blocking the main supply route from Turkey to Iraqi Kurdistan. The need for a tough line in Iraq is one of many reasons why Mr Clinton also needs to take a tougher line in Bosnia, thus refuting the absurd notion that Saddam is a victim of anti-Moslem prejudice. No one should imagine that the Serbian president or the Bosnian Serb leadership will be bound by last week's Gen-eva agreement. Slobodan Milosevic is imposing this agreement on the Bosnian Serbs as he imposed the Vance Plan on the Croatian Serbs a year ago: as a way of consolidating territorial gains and winning a breathing space from international pressure. They will neither hand over weapons nor withdraw from territory, unless forced to do so. The Bosnian government, like the Czechs in 1938, is willing to fight. It faces a fascist enemy that has been destroying villages, raping women en masse, torturing prisoners and systematically murdering the Moslem elite. But, like the Czechs in 1938, it cannot resist the concerted pressure of western powers. They recognised its independence, but refused to let it buy weapons, thereby delivering it into the hands of its heavily armed enemies. The west will pay dearly for this organised surrender to fascism, as it did in the 1930s. Mr Milosevic may not be a Hitler but he is a Mussolini, who if seen to succeed will serve as a model to even more dangerous fascists, most obviously in Russia. The Bush administration has used European reluctance as its excuse for a non-interventionist policy. Britain and France, but especially Britain, have used the exposure of their troops, in a supposedly neutral humanitarian role, as an excuse for refusing to take sides. Mr Clinton should either put US troops alongside the Europeans and demand a change in the rules of engagement, so that they can fight their way through to those in need of relief; or he should insist that the UN force be withdrawn. The Bosnian government forces could then be properly armed and given allied air cover, to help them recover areas from which their people have been expelled. Bosnians and Iraqis alike could fight their own battles, if the west would give up its false neutrality between them and their butchers.</p>

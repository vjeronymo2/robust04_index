			<p><P> March 15, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CENTURY 21 PUTTING NATIONAL ACCOUNT BACK OUT FOR BIDS  </P> <P> Century 21 Real Estate Corp., the nation's largest franchiser of real estate  brokerages, said Wednesday that it is putting its $30-million annual national  advertising program out to bid.  </P> <P> The process places incumbent national ad agency McCann-Erickson in Los Angeles  on notice that it must come up with some new and different approaches to  promoting the huge real estate franchise operator or be replaced.  </P> <P> Competition for the contract is expected to be fierce: $30 million a year in  billings make it a sizable one for most Southern California ad agencies to  tackle. It is one of the largest advertising budgets of any company based in  Orange County.  </P> <P> Richard J. Loughlin, president and chief executive of Century 21, said in a  statement that the firm -- which has 7,200 franchises and had $65 billion in  worldwide sales last year, its seventh consecutive year of record sales -- is  "satisfied with the performance" of McCann-Erickson.  </P> <P> But Century 21 has had only two domestic ad agencies in its 19-year history, he  said, and officials believe it "prudent after seven years" with McCann-Erickson  to investigate alternatives.  </P> <P> Officials of McCann-Erickson could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> Bruce Oseland, senior vice president for marketing and advertising at Century  21, said the company, which is owned by Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., is in  a rapidly changing industry that is undergoing a considerable amount of  consolidation.  </P> <P> Other major players have entered the market, Oseland said, including Sears,  Roebuck &amp; Co. -- owner of Costa Mesa-based Coldwell Banker Residential Real  Estate -- and Prudential Life Insurance Co. of American, owner of Newport  Beach-based Prudential Real Estate Affiliates.  </P> <P> With competition like that, he said, "we need to take a look at what we are  doing (with corporate advertising) to see if it is the best work and the work  we want to do for the future."  </P> <P> Coldwell Banker and BBDO Los Angeles severed their relationship last month  after a four-year marriage. Coldwell, the nation's No. 2 residential realty  organization with about 11% of the market, was spending $10 million a year on  domestic ad campaigns through BBDO.  </P> <P> Oseland declined to comment directly about the work McCann-Erickson has been  doing for Century 21 but said that when an advertising account is put up for  review "there generally is some level of concern about a particular aspect of  the advertising, be it on the media side or in research or in creative."  </P> <P> He said the review is expected to last 60 to 90 days and that Century 21 will  make a final decision from among four to six agencies, including  McCann-Erickson.  </P> <P> He said that no agencies other than McCann-Erickson have been identified yet as  participants in the review.  </P> <P> Several real estate industry observers said that with Century 21 coming off a  record year and with residential resale activity still healthy throughout the  country, there is no indication that the company is aiming to dump  McCann-Erickson because its ads haven't been working.  </P> <P> In its most recent campaign for Century 21, unveiled just a few weeks ago, the  agency created a spot featuring California Angels' pitcher Bert Blyleven  discussing how often he has been traded in his career -- five times -- and how  the last thing he needs is constant worry about selling his home.  </P> <P> As Blyleven turns away from the camera and walks back to the clubhouse, Angels  Manager Doug Rader appears and says he must talk to him -- the implication  being that the pitcher is about to be traded again. Blyleven then reaches into  his locker and pulls out a Century 21 "For Sale" sign.  </P> <P> "They've done some good work for us in the past" Oseland said. "We are not  doing this to change for change's sake, but we do want to explore other  approaches."  </P></p>

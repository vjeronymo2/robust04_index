			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, May 23 (AFP) -- Bosnian President Alija  Izetbegovic vowed Sunday [22 May] to negotiate and, if  necessary, fight to preserve the territorial integrity of Bosnia.    Izetbegovic arrived here on Sunday night from Saudi Arabia  as  guest of French intellectual Bernard-Henri Levy, who is  campaigning for a lifting of the arms embargo against the  mainly-Moslem government forces and recently released "Bosnia,"  a film about the war in Bosnia-Hercegovina.    Izetbegovic complained that the intervention of the  international community in his country had been "negative" and  had left the Moslems with their "hands tied." He said he would  continue to strive to have the arms embargo lifted.    "If our conditions are not met and if the arms embargo is  not  lifted, we will go on fighting," he told journalists.    The French Government has opposed lifting the embargo,  saying  it could precipitate the "crushing" of the Moslem forces or lead  to a long-drawn out war.    Izetbegovic, who returns home Monday, told compatriots who  came to applaud him on his arrival that the Serbs "will never  kill as many Bosnians as we will have children."    Referring to a tour he made of territory under Bosnian army  control, Izetbegovic said government forces were making  progress. "We will fight or die," he said.    Levy, who has denounced Europe's failure to counter militant  "Serb nationalism," is considering launching a "Sarajevo" list  of candidates in the European elections next month.    The list, called "Europe Begins in Sarajevo," would be  headed  by cancer specialist Leon Schwartzenberg.</p>

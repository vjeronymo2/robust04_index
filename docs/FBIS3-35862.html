He also spoke in favor of a single Black Sea  Fleet. The newly elected president told the news conference that  he intends to appeal to the Republic of the Crimea procurator in  connection with certain state structures negating the Law on the  President of the Republic of the Crimea. In Yuriy Meshkov's  words, the president does not even have a residence yet. He  also emphasized that if the Majles of the Crimean Tartar People  is a public organization it must register with the Crimean  Justice Ministry. However, "if the Majles claims the role of an  authority, I have to say that there must not be two such  authorities on the peninsula and the Majles must cease to  exist," Yuriy Meshkov stated.    In an exclusive interview with a UNIAN correspondent on the  same day, Refat Chubarov, deputy chairman of the Majles of the  Crimean Tartar people, said: "In my opinion, the results of the  elections in the Crimea and the election of Yuriy Meshkov as  president demonstrate that under the conditions of economic  collapse, political instability, and uncertainty, society is  prone to believe in the most adventurist aims and programs.  Another argument in favor of this suggestion is Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy's victory in the elections to Russia's State Duma."    In Refat Chubarov's words, there are grounds to believe that  Yuriy Meshkov in the post of the president will obstruct the  process of the Crimean Tartar people returning to their  historical homeland and restoring their political rights. "I am  convinced that Meshkov's next move will be to attempt to exclude  from the Law on the Elections to the Supreme Council of the  Crimea the amendment guaranteeing 14 parliamentary seats for the  Crimean Tartar people."    Forecasting the future situation on the peninsula, Chubarov  said that the Majles will never recognize the presidential  powers of an individual who would act to prevent the restoration  of the rights of the Crimean Tartar people. "If Meshkov begins  actions of a discriminatory nature against us, we in our turn  will react adequately. We, however, will not make the first  move, which would allow him to destabilize the situation on the  peninsula and achieve his aims," Chubarov stated.</p>

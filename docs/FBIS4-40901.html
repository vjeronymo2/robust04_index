			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Lyudmila Beldyugina: "`Warm Climes' Going Under </F> Lock and Key. Stavropol Kray Preparing for Introduction of Visa  Regulations"]    [Text] Stavropol Kray's State Duma Committee for  Legislation and Human Rights has prepared a package of documents  confirming the status of this vast border kray as a territory  with special immigration regulations.    This resolute attempt to bring immigration under strict  control was the result of a significant deterioration in social  welfare and the level of crime here. Deputies consider that one  main, if not the main reason for this is the uncontrolled and  barely verifiable process of rapid settlement of this land of  plenty by citizens of former USSR republics, in particular from  the Transcaucasus.    What is more, you cannot in any way classify those coming to  the kray to settle permanently as unfortunate, dispossessed  refugees and forced migrants. During the years 1990-1993 almost  500,000 people moved to the kray as permanent residents, but  only 10 percent of them are registered at the kray immigration  service as forced migrants. Only about 2,500 have officially  registered as Russian citizens, while the remainder are citizens  of other CIS states. There are people living within Russia who  are, it would seem, free from the obligations of Russian  Federation citizens, in particular military service. Young  people who dodge the draft feel "unrestrained" in everything  else as well. Very often they come into conflict with the law  and public moral standards. This provokes genuine revulsion  among the indigenous population of the towns and villages, who  often turn against all "ethnics" in general. Reports about  village assemblies ending in ultimatums and demands that  "outsiders" be evicted from this or that population center are  all over the local press.    Unregulated mass immigration is causing the general quality  of life in the kray to deteriorate sharply. You are struck by  the unusually high prices for the south of food in the markets  and of manufactured and household goods in the stores. Prices  here are higher than in Moscow and other Russian industrial  centers, and incomes are a lot lower.    But even this is not the main point: The whole of Stavropol  Kray's infrastructure is bursting at the seams. A minimum of 40  new schools and an even greater number of kindergartens need to  be constructed for the immigrants' children -- there has been an  increase of 40,000 children in the past three years. A further  9 billion rubles are required for medical services for the  newcomers. But the kray's treasury is empty.    Yet many of the newcomers immediately buy up individual  homes, garages, plots of land to build on, luxury dachas, and  other real estate. Information about this in the possession of  the service for fighting organized crime, which for the moment  cannot be disclosed as there is a secret investigation in  progress, is -- take my word for it -- very impressive.    Representatives of many kray departments, parties,  movements,  and members of the intelligentsia participated in the stormy  parliamentary hearings on problems of immigration. Practically  all the participants came out in favor of introducing special  immigration regulations. With the exception of Yevgeniy  Borodin, cochairman of the kray organization of the "Democratic  Russia" movement. He considers that the proposed measures are  not in keeping with the Russian Federation Constitution and  infringe human rights. He sees a danger in overzealous  officials' introducing visa regulations "with a strong element  of Russian nationalism." For example, Professor A. Avksentyev,  who is well-known in these parts, stated directly: "In  immigration, priority should be given to the Russian population,  and all others should be regarded as having foreign status...."    The motivation of the advocates of the "Russified approach"  is equally serious: The proportion of Russians in the overall  population of this kray, where more than 100 peoples and  nationalities live, has begun to fall in recent years. There is  also every sign that this trend will strengthen. What is more  this is a trend with a clear criminal coloration. Corrupt  Stavropol officials are accepting enormous bribes to grant  inhabitants of the Transcaucasus -- people who are on the whole  well-to-do -- permits to live in cities and population centers  in the Mineralnyye Vody area of the Caucasus. Although there is  a strict quota for residence permits here, this proves to be no  obstacle. The quota has been exceeded twice over in the past  three years.    The deputies propose introducing different payments for  residence permits in different regions while stepping up the  monitoring process to check that quotas are adhered to. In the  kray center it will cost immigrants from Russia 500 times the  minimum wage, while it will cost immigrants from the CIS 1,000  times and foreigners 2,500 times the minimum wage. It is  proposed to permit the entry of foreign citizens, including  those from former USSR republics, and persons without  citizenship only on production of an invitation from an  inhabitant of the kray or a corporate body registered there. It  will only be possible to register for permanent residence with  the backing of an enterprise, organization, a state or municipal  body, or relatives. A mechanism has also been produced to expel  from the territory people who have gone there without a visa.    The participants in the hearings complained once more about  the legal mess over the border between Russia and Chechnya and  again appealed to the Russian Government. "It is absolutely  essential to finally determine our position vis-a-vis Chechnya,"  Nikolay Novoseltsev, hetman of the kray Cossack union, said  indignantly. "If this is a republic which is part of Russia,  order must be established there; if it is not, the border with  it must be firmly closed."    The situation really is unbearable: A wave of violence,  robbery, and murder is spreading unimpeded from Chechnya across  the whole of southern Russia. After making their "raids," the  criminals hide there on its territory and feel absolutely safe  there. It is not as if the borders here were "transparent."    So the Stavropol deputies and public have approved the  legislative base for immigration regulations produced by the  duma committee. In the opinion of committee chairman Viktor  Khloponi, a well-known kray specialist on combating organized  crime and corruption, the local parliament will examine the  question of introducing the visa regulations at its next session.</p>

			<p>920116 FT  16 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: Asda Yesterday's 19 per cent rise in the Asda share price might seem a generous response to an interim retained loss of Pounds 106m, or 16 per cent of the group's market value. But the Pounds 10m pre-tax profit before exceptionals was rather better than expected; and if the exceptionals were worse, that doubtless testifies to the reforming zeal of the new management. The snag is that the group's new strategy has not yet been formulated, let alone published. It remains worrying that, with Gateway also searching for a role, some 20 per cent of the UK grocery industry depends for its future on finding gaps in the market. Asda prefers to point to its huge asset base and the transformation that would ensue if it were put to productive use. But with the grocery market faltering, it could still all go wrong. The prudent strategy for investors is to wait for hard evidence, even at the risk of missing the early part of any rise.</p>

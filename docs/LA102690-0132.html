			<p><P> October 26, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BEATING, THEFT BY DEPUTIES ALLEGED;  </P> <P> TRIAL: A CONVICTED MONEY LAUNDERER TESTIFIES THAT SHERIFF'S NARCOTICS OFFICERS  STOLE $65,000 AND ABUSED HIM WHILE HE WAS HANDCUFFED DURING A 1988 DRUG RAID.  </P> <P> A convicted money launderer who claims Los Angeles County sheriff's narcotics  officers stole $65,000 from him testified Thursday that deputies beat him while  he was handcuffed and one officer placed a revolver to his head in a mock  execution during a 1988 drug raid.  </P> <P> Arturo Rojas Zavala, 22, told a Los Angeles federal court jury that deputies  Terrell H. Amers and Eufrasio G. Cortez -- who are on trial with five other  sheriff's officers for alleged money-skimming -- roughed him up after he was  stopped by members of their narcotics investigation team.  </P> <P> Rojas, who used the alias Carlos Luis Soto, testified that the deputies had  taken him back to his West Covina motel, where he was beaten while handcuffed  for reportedly refusing to give officers the combination to his locked  briefcase.  </P> <P> "They put me on top of the bed, put a pillow on my back and Amers got on top of  me and hit me," Rojas said in Spanish while pointing to his lower back.  </P> <P> Rojas, through an interpreter, said he was pummeled by Amers and then kicked in  the face by an unidentified deputy before he was taken from the room. When he  refused to sign a disclaimer form disowning $200,000 found in his pickup truck,  Rojas said Cortez socked him in the stomach before he finally signed the  document that allowed the deputies to seize his cash. Rojas said he later  learned that only $135,000 of the money was turned in to authorities.  </P> <P> Rojas, who pleaded guilty to a money-laundering charge, said the cash was  earmarked for a cocaine deal. And he acknowledged that he worked for a Mexican  drug ring that had stored 311 kilos of cocaine in a nearby warehouse.  </P> <P> But as he was being driven to that warehouse by Amers, the deputy "took his gun  out and put it up to my head . . . and looked like he was going to fire it,"  Rojas testified. "Then he took it away."  </P> <P> Attorneys for both Amers and Cortez declined comment on Rojas' testimony,  citing a gag order imposed this week by U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie.  </P> <P> But in cross-examining Rojas, Cortez's attorney, James Riddet, suggested that  the drug dealer had lied about the beatings and was cooperating with federal  prosecutors after his prison sentence had been reduced from a maximum of nine  years to two years.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, another admitted drug dealer claimed in testimony Thursday that the  defendants had stolen $70,000 during a 1988 raid at his Wilmington duplex. But  when asked if he could identify any of the deputies, the man pointed to a  defense attorney and one defendant -- Macario M. Duran -- who was not at the  raid.  </P> <P> The other defendants include Ronald E. Daub, Daniel M. Garner, James R. Bauder  and John C. Dickenson.  </P> <P> In addition to the drug dealers, prosecutors Thursday called a string of  witnesses to show that some of the deputies had paid thousands of dollars --  much of it in cash -- for vacation homes, satellite dishes, furniture, boats,  helicopter flying lessons and a share in a race horse.  </P> <P> Billy Earl Harp, a real estate agent from Bullhead City, Ariz., testified that  Cortez made a $5,000 deposit in cash for some property near the Colorado River.  "We were in the garage because the wind was blowing, and it was hard to hold  onto the money," he recalled.  </P> <P> When questioned by Cortez's attorney, however, Hart acknowledged that there was  nothing illegal about paying in cash and that the deputy never tried to conceal  his ownership or method of payment.  </P> <P> A witness subpoenaed by the government to testify against Amers sparked a  heated moment in the trial.  </P> <P> Deputy Virgil Bartlett, who prosecutors said is "a subject of the federal  corruption investigation," told jurors that he had sold his 19-foot boat to  Amers for $18,000 in cash and acknowledged that the government had agreed not  to prosecute him for any statement he made in court.  </P> <P> But when Assistant U.S. Atty. Thomas A. Hagemann routinely asked Bartlett if  the government had made any other promises, Bartlett shot back: "More threats  than promises."  </P> <P> Under cross-examination by defense attorneys, Bartlett claimed that Hagemann  had threatened to take him before the grand jury unless he testified against  Amers -- an assertion that was challenged by the prosecutor.  </P></p>

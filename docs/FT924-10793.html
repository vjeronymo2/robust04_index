			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / International Capital Markets: Continental firms pose threat to UK brokers, study says CONTINENTAL European brokers are posing an increasing threat to London-based brokerage houses when it comes to European equity research, according to a survey of institutional investors published today 'Continental European brokers are rapidly winning respect among institutional investors for the quality of their equity research,' says the European Brokers &amp; Analysts Survey 1992, produced by Euromoney Publications. The survey is based on the responses of 136 international institutional investors, including large insurance companies, pension funds and other fund managers responsible for managing a total of around Dollars 1,759bn. Investment managers were asked for their views on the quality and execution of European equity and bond research. The main findings are: Continental European brokers, which are pouring more of their resources into their research activities, are increasingly posing a threat to established London-based brokers. Nearly 97 per cent of respondents said they dealt through local brokers, 74.2 per cent through London, 38.1 per cent through New York, and 27.8 per cent through Tokyo. The survey points out that local brokerage houses tend to derive strength from 'an intimate knowledge of their local market coupled with very close links at a senior level with the companies they track'. While London-based houses have often emerged as winners in their coverage of the European markets, Euromoney concludes that these preferences are changing, particularly in markets such as Spain (where Madrid-based brokers F&amp;G lead the field) and Germany (where Deutsche Bank is the clear leader). The majority of investors prefer to receive individual company research, rather than comparisons within a sector. 'The majority of institutional investors maintain an essentially bottom-up approach,' says the survey, with individual company research followed by demand for sector, individual country, and pan-European research. Nearly three-quarters - 72.4 per cent - of respondents said they are prepared to finance their own research, either to supplement or to replace broker research. The larger the investor, the more likely it is to undertake its own research: 82.6 per cent of respondents who manage Dollars 2bn or more said they pursue their own company research. The main reason for financing in-house research is investors' concern over conflicts of interest at the leading brokers and investment banks. Partly as a result of these concerns, over a third - 35.4 per cent - of investors said they are using independent equity research to supplement information supplied by the banks and brokers. However, they said the main reason for turning to independent equity research outfits is quality. Investors appear to be monitoring the research of fewer analysts now than in the past, with over 43 per cent of respondents monitoring just three analysts. Over half the investors said they are using fewer brokers than before, particularly within the more mature markets. With so many houses covering the UK and other Continental European markets 'a great deal of research which is expensively produced by the leading banks and brokers goes to waste'. Institutions which invest in the European bond markets said they looked chiefly for accuracy in the research provided by the economic analysts, followed by explanation, future risk assessment, consistency and an ability to put the research within a global context. Goldman Sachs emerged as the clear leader among the European economic analysts, followed by USB Phillips &amp; Drew, Deutsche Bank, J. P. Morgan, Enskilda Securities, S. G. Warburg, Morgan Stanley, BZW, Nomura and Midland Montagu.</p>

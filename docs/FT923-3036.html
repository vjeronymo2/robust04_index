			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / EC energy charter faces delay FORMAL agreement on the European energy charter - aimed at boosting energy investment in central and eastern Europe - is being held up by differences over certain 'basic questions of principle', according to an EC official. Representatives of the 47 signatories of the charter - which is aimed at boosting energy investment in central and eastern Europe - met last week to prepare for next month's full session of the energy charter conference. But they were unable to reach agreement on the crucial questions which would allow members to sign a legally binding treaty before the end of the year. The principles of the charter, agreed last December, cannot be put into practice until the treaty is signed. Mr Clive Jones, secretary general of the charter conference, said yesterday that outstanding problems included: Non-discrimination - the charter would force signatories to treat foreign energy investors in exactly the same way as domestic investors. But Norway, for example, wants to retain the right to give preference to its own oil companies; The environment - there is disagreement about which conclusions of this year's Rio summit on the environment should be included in the treaty; Transit rights; The length and conditions of transition periods for east European countries to implement the charter.</p>

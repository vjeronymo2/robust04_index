			<p><P> March 3, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL PLAYOFFS;  </P> <P> GIRLS' DIVISION V;  </P> <P> LA JOLLA COUNTRY DAY WINS ON SCHOEPFLIN FREE THROWS  </P> <P> It was only fitting that Isabel Schoepflin got the winning free throws in La  Jolla Country Day's 49-47 victory over Calvin Christian in the Division V  girls' basketball championships Thursday at the Sports Arena.  </P> <P> Coach Jack Wigley said no one wanted the victory more than Schoepflin, who had  played every minute the past two games.  </P> <P> "She's got tremendous timing for a sophomore," Wigley said.  </P> <P> Schoepflin, who started last year as a freshman, was a first-team all-league  selection this season.  </P> <P> The Torres (17-5) not only defended their division championship, they also got  revenge on the Crusaders (23-2), who had defeated them twice this season.  </P> <P> "I think we won it because we wanted to win it after they beat us twice,"  Schoepflin said.  </P> <P> With less than a minute to play, Betsy Wilgenburg made a steal and drove  downcourt for a layup to put Calvin Christian ahead, 47-46. Schoepflin was  fouled with 35 seconds left and made one of two free throws to tie the score,  47-47. Nine seconds later, Schoepflin was fouled again and this time made both  free throws.  </P> <P> Calvin Christian, which led most of the game, had a chance to win but missed  two layups in the final 10 seconds. The Crusaders led throughout the first half  but the Torres' Julie Corbo scored at the buzzer to tie the score, 22-22, at  halftime. Calvin Christian's Betsy Wilgenburg scored at the third-quarter  buzzer to tie the score again, 34-34. Schoepflin, who had only two points in  the first half, led the Torres with 13 points. Nancy Dickerson and Robin  Chatman each added 10 points.  </P> <P> The Torres' goal was to stop Calvin Christian's 5-9 guard, Wilgenburg, who led  her team with 19 points.  </P> <P> "We went more man-to-man and tried to shut Betsy down," Wigley said. "She's  tough to stop."  </P></p>

			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / World Trade News: Etra joins top rival Etra, one of the four consortia racing to meet Saturday's pre-qualification deadline for bids to run Italy's second mobile telecommunications network, has made a surprise decision to join forces with a leading rival, reports Haig Simonian from Milan. The Etra group, predominantly comprising subsidiaries of the state-owned Eni energy and chemicals holding company, is merging with Unitel, a rival made up of Fiat, Fininvest and Vodafone of the UK. The move comes amid hectic last-minute preparations for the January 15 deadline. The list of companies deemed to have met the qualification criteria should be released by the end of January, and the winning candidate is expected to be announced by the end of April. Italy's is one of Europe's fastest-growing mobile telephone markets, with more than 1.1m subscribers to the existing network, run by the state-controlled Sip telecommunications monopoly. Mobile telecommunications in Italy have caught on fast since being inaugurated in 1985, and the market is now the third biggest in Europe after the UK and Germany.</p>

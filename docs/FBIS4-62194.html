			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, 12 May -- Representatives of the Abkhazian  side at the Georgian-Abkhazian talks in Moscow have said that  they are against the deployment of CIS or Russian troops on the  entire territory of the Abkhazian region. They justifyg their  stance through the fact that the United Nations has not yet  adopted a resolution on the deployment of peacekeeping forces in  the Abkhazian region.    According to observers, the Abkhazian side's stance is just  an excuse in order not to compromise.</p>

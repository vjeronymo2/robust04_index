			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Letter of congratulations from Cuban President Fidel Castro </F> to Daniel Ortega, secretary general of the Nicaraguan Sandinist  National Liberation Front, FSLN, dated 24 May]    [Text] Havana, 24 May 1994, 36th year of the revolution.    Comrade Daniel Ortega Saavedra    Secretary General    Sandinist National Liberation Front    Dear Daniel:    Allow me to express my most fraternal congratulations for  your recent election as FSLN secretary general.    The special congress that recently ended was, undoubtedly,  an  expression of maturity, particularly of the unity preserved by  that political organization during the most difficult stages of  struggle through which it has historically journeyed.    That event blazes a path of hope for the organization in its  continuous efforts to accomplish the objectives of genuine and  full social justice, results to which it has committed decades  of struggle, as well as the valuable blood of its martyrs.    Under international circumstances as complex as the present,  where a unipolar world under the hegemony of the United States  has taken shape, the will, fortitude for struggle, and faith in  the people's victory is tested.    I would like to convey my congratulations to all the comrade  delegates to the congress, the Sandinist Assembly, and the  elected National Directorate.    An embrace,    [Signed] Fidel Castro Ruz.</p>

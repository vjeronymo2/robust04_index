			<p>BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, 13 Apr (TANJUG) -- "We are ready for a  peace process but we are not ready to accept as negotiators  those who ordered the bombing of the Serb positions," Srpska  republic president Radovan Karadzic said ahead of talks with  David Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg, cochairmen of the  conference on Yugoslavia. He stressed that the Serb side would  choose who will be the mediators in peace negotiations.    "The European Union was completely pushed out of the  resolution of the Bosnia-Herzegovina conflict after Washington  launched its diplomatic initiative," Karadzic. He added that now  "a new crisis has been created in which the United States can be  proclaimed a warring faction."    "This may be the moment for the European Union to return to  the political scene in search of solutions to the current  conflicts in Bosnia," the Srpska republic president said.</p>

			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / FT Guide For The Serious Investor (13): Rising markets will pull more into the net - Capital gains tax planning / The Inland Revenue expects increased turnover in stocks and property. Scheherazade Daneshkhu considers some of the measures that can help to reduce the bill on gains above the annual exemption CAPITAL GAINS tax is not a problem for most people. The number who pay it has been falling steadily. In the 1992-93 tax year, there were 1.6m higher-rate taxpayers, but only 85,000 taxpayers faced a bill for CGT, compared with 155,000 in 1989-90. The amount of CGT assessed by the Inland Revenue has also been falling, from Pounds 2.8bn in 1989-90 to Pounds 1.2bn in 1992-93. The drop was influenced by the relatively poor performance of the stock market. However, the Inland Revenue expects an increase in turnover in stocks and property, and estimates that 125,000 taxpayers will be eligible for CGT in the current tax year. An oddity introduced by the 1993 Finance Act is that, in some cases, the existence of capital gains can produce an extra income tax bill as well as a CGT bill. CGT is charged on gains made when disposing of assets. You are allowed to make Pounds 5,800 of gains in the current tax year before being liable to CGT. Some assets, such as your main home, are exempt from CGT. Measures which reduce the bill on gains above the annual exemption are an indexation allowance, which gives protection from the effects of post-1982 inflation, and the ability to offset losses against gains. One investment trust, launched this year by Ivory &amp; Sime, was based on exploiting the annual CGT exemption. The Isis trust automatically sells 7 per cent each year of an investor's original capital in order to generate a monthly income plan. BES and Peps: The Business Expansion Scheme and Personal Equity Plans are free of CGT. Investors can place Pounds 40,000 in a BES in a single tax year but the investment must be held for five years for the CGT exemption to apply. This is the last year of the BES which will be wound up on December 31. There is no time limit on a Pep but the annual limits are relatively small. Only a maximum of Pounds 9,000 (via a Pounds 6,000 general and a Pounds 3,000 single company Pep) can be invested in any one tax year. The drawback with these investments is that if you were unlucky with them, it would not be possible to offset losses against gains elsewhere. Bed and Breakfasting: This is the term given to a sale one day and a purchase the next of shares, to establish either a loss (to offset against other gains) or to realise gains in order to use up as much as possible of this year's allowance, since it cannot be carried forward. The main problem with a bed-and-breakfast deal is that it involves costs, such as commission and stamp duty, and it carries the risk that prices might move while you are out of the market. Bed and breakfasting does not work for 'relevant securities' - those covered by the accrued-income scheme, deep-discount securities and shares in non-qualifying offshore funds. Establishing an allowable loss on convertible loan stock, for example, requires care, because the settlement day for the re-acquisition must be later than that for the sale. It is best to consult an accountant about CGT on the sale of non-listed shares. Married couples: If you are married (and living together), one way of lessening the CGT bill in any single tax year is to transfer assets to your spouse, in order to use his or her annual CGT exemption, or to ensure that gains are taxed on the spouse with the lower tax rate. The transfer is usually tax-free, and when the spouse comes to sell the asset it will be taxed as if they had acquired it at the same price as you paid, broadly speaking. Deferring payment or sale of assets: Brian Todd, of Coopers &amp; Lybrand, says that, if you are planning to leave the UK for more than one complete tax year, you should defer the sale of any assets likely to incur a hefty CGT liability, until after the end of the tax year in which you leave the country. The assets can then be sold in the next tax year, and there will be no CGT liability so long as the Inland Revenue regards you as not resident (and not ordinarily resident) in the UK. To minimise annual gains, Touche Ross suggests postponing disposals scheduled for just before the end of the tax year until just after. This reduces the gains taxable in the current year and delays the date on which tax becomes payable. The danger is that tax rates may be higher in the next year. If you have no gains in one tax year but expect making them in the next, Maurice Parry-Wingfield, of Touche Ross, suggests realising allowable losses in the current tax year and carrying them forward to the next year. This ensures that next year's gain is reduced by next year's annual exemption. If the loss is realised next year, the gain will be reduced by the loss first, so that the annual exemption would be wasted. Full-time directors of unquoted companies, selling shares in their company, can benefit from a new CGT relief. If they held at least 5 per cent of the shares for at least one year and, in the last year, had invested (or planned to invest within three years) in another unquoted company, they may be able to hold over part of their gain and therefore defer the capital gains. Todd says that the investor would have to hold at least 5 per cent of the shares in the new company to qualify for the relief. James Higgins, of fee-based advisers Chamberlain de Broe, recommends a number of CGT planning devices for those with sizeable capital gains, including the use of offshore bonds and 90/10 funds, which hold just under 90 per cent in sterling cash and 10 per cent in other currencies. These funds can be used to establish an indexed book loss to offset against gains, but are more effective in times of high inflation. Higgins says that, in some cases, those with large share holdings in private companies who wish to transfer assets to children or other members of the family, may consider the use of a discretionary trust. The transfer of shares into the trust is regarded as a disposal, and is therefore liable to CGT. However, hold-over relief applies, whereby you are effectively passing on the gain to the recipients. There is no capital gains tax to pay on death, when your assets are instead liable to inheritance tax. Since Pounds 150,000 of assets can currently be passed on to your heirs free of inheritance tax, the discretionary trust is one way of getting around the CGT problem for large shareholdings. Relevant leaflets from the Inland Revenue are: CGT4 (owner occupied houses), CGT 6 (retirement relief on disposal of a business), CGT13 (indexation allowance for quoted shares), CGT 14 (an introduction), CGT15 (a guide for married couples) and CGT16 (indexation allowance disposals after April 5 1988).</p>

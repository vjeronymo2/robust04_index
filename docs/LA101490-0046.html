			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIES OF THE WEEK  </P> <P> A Quiet Little Neighborhood, a Perfect Little Murder (NBC Sunday at 9 p.m.) is  a new TV movie in which a woman, newly moved to the suburbs with her husband,  overhears a murder plot. Teri Garr and Robert Urich star.  </P> <P> Judith Light and Michael Ontkean star in In Defense of a Married Man (ABC  Sunday at 9 p.m.), another new TV movie, in which a criminal attorney defends  her husband who's on trial for murdering his mistress.  </P> <P> Victor/Victoria (Channel 5 Monday at 7:30 p.m.) is a wise, delicious musical  sendup of all the absurdities and hypocrisies surrounding the issue of sexual  orientation. Blake Edwards' 1982 gem stars Julie Andrews and Robert Preston.  </P> <P> With the 1981 History of the World, Part 1 (Channel 11 Monday at 8 p.m.) Mel  Brooks indulges himself in some whoopee cushion humor, involving a Friars Club  galaxy of comedians and ranging in situations from the Stone Age to the French  Revolution.  </P> <P> Cheech &amp; Chong's The Corsican Brothers (Channel 13 Monday at 8 p.m.) finds  the comic duo doing some traveling of their own -- into another century (18th),  another country (France) and another territory (the swashbuckler) with a  certain zany lyricism and some generous borrowing from Dumas.  </P> <P> Kaleidoscope (NBC Monday at 9 p.m.) is a new TV movie from a Danielle Steel  novel in which three sisters are strangely reunited by a private eye hired by a  dying man. Jaclyn Smith and Perry King star.  </P> <P> Fine Things (NBC Tuesday at 8 p.m.) is another new TV movie from a Danielle  Steel novel, in which fate takes an executive's wife and tries to take his  daughter. Tracy Pollan, D. W. Moffett and Cloris Leachman star.  </P> <P> All the Right Moves (Channel 11, Tuesday at 8 p.m.) is a solid, involving  little picture starring Tom Cruise, who is excellent as a high school football  player desperate to land a scholarship as a way out of his small, dying town.  </P> <P> In Moscow on the Hudson (Channel 11 Wednesday at 8 p.m.), Robin Williams is  irresistible as a Moscow circus saxophonist who defects in Bloomingdale's.  </P> <P> My Bodyguard (Channel 2 Wednesday at 9 p.m.) marked a nifty 1980 directorial  debut for actor Tony Bill. Set primarily in a Chicago high school, it centers  on a new kid (Chris Makepeace), a shy victim who finds his real strengths the  hard way. Matt Dillon is the swaggering bully, and Adam Baldwin is the big,  moody loner who Makepeace wants to be his bodyguard.  </P> <P> Opposites Attract (NBC Wednesday at 9 p.m.), a new TV movie, finds a town  supervisor (Barbara Eden) running for mayor against a movie star (John  Forsythe) new to the community.  </P> <P> Thursday at 8 p.m. brings a choice between two vintage Clint Eastwood movies,  Coogan's Bluff (Channel 5) in which he's a Southwestern lawman turned loose on  Manhattan's mean streets, and The Gauntlet (on Channel 13), in which he's again  a Southwestern lawman (a Phoenix cop) who goes to Las Vegas to extradite  terrified hooker Sondra Locke to be a witness at a mobster's trial.  </P> <P> MASH (Channel 5 Friday at 8 p.m.) is Robert Altman's stunning 1970 black comedy  on the absurdity of war (and much else).  </P></p>

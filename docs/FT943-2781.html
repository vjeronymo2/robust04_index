			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Telephone banking at Barclays Barclays Bank is to launch a national telephone banking service for personal customers which will be integrated with its branch network, Alison Smith writes. The move follows an 18-month pilot study involving 15,000 customers. The new service, Barclaycall, will be launched in November. It will open every day but will not be available on a 24-hour basis. Initially it will be able to deal with 20,000 new customers a month. After the success of First Direct, the telephone banking subsidiary of Midland Bank, all the leading banks and some larger building societies have launched some form of telephone banking, although some are still at a pilot stage. Midland is still the only bank to offer an entirely telephone-based service. The others see telephone banking as a complement to branch banking. Barclays is thought to be putting Pounds 20m to Pounds 30m into the project. The operation will be based in Coventry.</p>

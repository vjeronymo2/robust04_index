			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Vladimir Isakov "parliamentary diary": "Accord According </F> to Schedule"]    [Excerpts] Who Here Is Against Peace?    This is the second week in a row that the reading Russian  public has been intensively studying the document entitled  "Agreement on Achieving Civil Accord in Russia," which President  Yeltsin sent to parliament.    The "Agreement" opens with the fresh idea that "civil accord  is needed in Russia today as never before" and "there are no  problems that cannot be resolved without fueling social tension  and not resorting to violence." Although the author of the  document has plainly become entangled in gerunds, his meaning is  clear and cannot be disagreed with. And yet I recall that we  had already been told with equal conviction that "Russia has  exhausted its quota of revolutions," but then they upped and  carried one out. "Impossible, impossible, impossible!" they  repeat every time. The longer they repeat it, the more obvious  it becomes: "If we want to very much, then we can!"    The section "Political Life of Society" speaks of the need  to  comply with the Constitution and the principles of democracy, a  civil society, and the separation of powers. But protective  motives can be glimpsed through the fence of general phrases:  "The sides pledge to refrain from making changes to the  Constitution which destabilize the situation" and also "not to  initiate political campaigns for the purpose of holding  early...elections." In return the authorities make a broad  gesture: They pledge to reject the "uncivilized and incorrect"  use of the mass media and to stop attaching insulting labels to  "heroic and tragic pages of the past."    But is it possible to "close" the question of early  elections  when Russia has a president who was elected back in the Russian  Soviet Federated Socialist Republic, who exempted himself from  an oath to the former Constitution and did not take an oath to  the new one, who dissolved parliament on condition that both  branches of power would be reelected, and who, right after the  shoot-up, went back on his word? Can such a president be  considered a legitimate authority? Is it possible to silence  those who demand that he stand for election again without delay  in accordance with the proper procedure?    At first sight the section "Regional Policy" is extremely  balanced. On the one hand it declares "the need to broaden the  independence of the components of the Federation by  strengthening the tax base," while on the other it emphasizes an  increase in the responsibility of the organs of power of the  components of the Federation for the collection of federal  taxes. The warning is more than topical, since more and more  components of the Federation -- Tatarstan, Bashkortostan,  Karelia, Yakutia (Sakha) -- are ceasing to transfer taxes to the  federal treasury. Today the republic budget is shrinking like  shagreen leather and reaching ridiculous figures -- something  like approximately 9 percent of gross domestic product. However  you share out this sheepskin and stretch it, it obviously cannot  "cover" science, education, culture, health care, defense,  assistance for the countryside, and Russia's foreign economic  obligations.    Foreseeing serious problems with the country's unity and  integrity, they are trying to secure from the components of the  Federation a "written undertaking not to leave" -- a pledge to  renounce changing their constitutional status for two years.  But, in addition to this, it would be a good thing to demand of  the Moscow authorities a pledge that they will, at least, abide  strictly by that status as it exists today.    In connection with the fact that the law on the principles  of the delimitation of powers has still not been adopted, the  federal power has solemnly promised to announce a moratorium on  the signing of bilateral treaties on the delimitation of terms  of reference and powers. Was it worth a wasted effort --  signing such a treaty with Tatarstan? What about the fact that  advances have also been issued to a number of regions?    The section "Conditions and Mechanism for Fulfilling This  Agreement" appears very surprising. For the purpose of  monitoring compliance with the Agreement, it is proposed to form  a Conciliation Commission from representatives of the president,  the government, the chambers, and the State Duma factions. The  procedure for forming the commission and its numerical  composition have not been defined at all, and yet precisely it  will be entrusted with determining the fact of a violation of  the Agreement and precisely it will be empowered to use measures  of influence against violators, even including proposals to  dismiss them from a leading post and to lay down their powers as  a deputy.    I need not cite anymore. It is already clear that the  "Agreement" is of an extremely one-sided nature and is very  reminiscent of the agreements between the first conquistadores  and the ingenuous and naive indians.    It would be quite possible to forgive the shortcomings of  the  first version of the document but for another important  circumstance. Please tell me, who now is preventing the  president from shaping and implementing a policy of accord  without any "agreements"? Nobody. Meanwhile, every day there  is a new act of confrontation -- with the Constitution, with  parliament, with society. Here are just a few examples.    Two weeks after the Duma adopted the amnesty decree and the  Memorandum of Accord, S. Filatov, leader of the president's  administration, signed a directive confirming the list of  "disfranchised" persons -- former people's deputies of the  Russian Federation to whom social guarantees do not extend.  Their entire "guilt" consists in the fact that they were not  cowardly and did not run away but fulfilled to the end their  duty to the Constitution, as a deputy is supposed to do. As a  result, they have been deprived of privileges, are not taken on  for work, and are not granted a pension. They are outcasts and  persons of no fixed abode with deputies' badges.    A little earlier an analytical note by P. Filippov, leader  of  the analytical center for socioeconomic policy, had popped up  out of the presidential structures. In it he unequivocally  recommended that the president embark on the compulsory  disbandment of kolkhozes and sovkhozes. Corresponding draft  edicts also appeared. Evidently, it never occurs to the  president's favorite oprichnik that the kolkhozes and sovkhozes,  which he despises, still bear the brunt of supplying the country  with food. That on the eve of sowing it is stupid and  shortsighted to get under a farmer's feet with such edicts.    Parliament has been sent a budget which demonstratively  "forgets" the chambers of the Federal Assembly, as though they  no longer existed. Funding for deputies' aides in the provinces  has been ended on orders from above. And not just aides -- this  is now the fourth month that the Duma itself, evicted from its  legal residence, has been working in totally unadapted premises,  surrounded by commercial structures. During this time dozens of  guests have been inside its walls, including an ex-president of  the United States. But the deputies have never been vouchsafed  the honor of beholding their own president with their own eyes.    The questions of Russia's joining the "Partnership for  Peace"  program and of holding joint Russian-U.S. maneuvers on the  Totskiy range were decided in a "spirit of peace and accord."  They were announced without any consultation with parliament,  despite public protests.    And then there is the business with Kazannik, who last week,  yielding to brazen pressure, tendered to the Federation Council  his resignation from the post of Russian Federation general  prosecutor....    Even the essentially secondary draft law on the procedure  for  publishing and validating federal laws gave rise to an acute  juridical conflict. At first the president sent an amicable  letter and amendments to this draft law, which the Duma  accepted. But a week after the adoption of the law on its  second reading he "covered" it with an edict which canceled out  the already adopted law from the first to the last article....    In short, there are more than enough examples of "accord"  and "peaceful cooperation." "We will not allow war, but no  stone will be left standing in the struggle for peace...."  Immortal lines!  <H5>  "Partnership for NATO" </H5>   The question of Russia's joining the "Partnership for Peace"  program is a visible example of the confusion now reigning in  the foreign policy sphere. Discordant statements, contradictory  speeches by high officials, which cancel each other out.... On  top of everything -- defiant, lordly disdain for the position of  parliament and for public opinion.    True, the question is far from simple. Opponents of joining  point out that expanding NATO and bringing its zone of operation  closer to Russia's borders is a direct violation of the  political pledges first given to Gorbachev and then to Yeltsin  as a condition for the speediest withdrawal of Russian troops  from the territory of contiguous states. The troops have been  withdrawn ahead of schedule, but the pledges...have they been  forgotten?    It is perfectly obvious that the attempts to jostle Russia  into NATO's "anteroom" place it, a Eurasian power and one of the  initiators of the CSCE, in an ambiguous position. To all  appearances, joining the NATO security system will put an end to  the intention to create our own security system within the CIS  framework. Politicians of very different trends, including  those whom it is hard to suspect of having sympathies with  "communofascism," unequivocally maintain that joining the  "Partnership for Peace" program does not accord with Russia's  international status.    But it cannot fail to be seen that Russia's resolute refusal  will be perceived extremely ambivalently in the world.  "Russia's refusal to join the program," Stephen Larrabee, a  leading staffer of the Rand Corporation, maintains, "will be a  watershed in the development of Russia's relations with the  West.... Very many people in the United States will say that in  this way Russia wants to retain a completely free hand in the  CIS and thereby confirms its neoimperial ambitions."    So, two versions -- one worse than the other. It is  legitimate to ask: How can such a thing have happened? Why has  Russian diplomacy, which shouts from the house-tops about the  "new Russia" and about "loyalty to democratic principles and the  ideals of human rights," led the country to such a shameful,  humiliating choice?    Let us listen to Foreign Minister Kozyrev:    "In the course of complex discussions we jointly arrived at  the idea of deepening and institutionalizing cooperation with  NATO -- an idea embodied in the `Partnership for Peace' concept  advanced by the United States. Let us commit to memory the  words `we' and `jointly.'"    But here is the opinion of U.S. politicians and forecasters  of the Heritage Foundation. Feel the difference:    "In order to curb revanchist Russia, the United States must  encourage the implementation of necessary economic and political  reforms in the countries of central and East Europe, so that  they can join NATO....    "Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic have begun  implementing the difficult political, economic, and military  reforms which will be required for NATO membership. No country  which does not wish or is not able to implement these reforms  will be afforded the opportunity to enjoy the security  guarantees provided by NATO. Thus, neither Ukraine, which  possesses nuclear weapons, nor Russia, which is pursuing an  expansionist course, can be regarded as suitable candidates for  any membership, even formal membership, of NATO....    "Russia should be allowed to become NATO's `partner,' as  provided for in Clinton's `Partnership for Peace' program, but  only if it continues the course of democratic market reforms."    Do you understand? Those who do not understand are told  straight to their face:    "It is also important that Clinton's warning to Russia that  the price of returning to dictatorship and imperialist expansion  will be a high one should be heard."    This is how our "strategic partners" express themselves,  unlike our twittering minister.... Listen, maybe Kozyrev should  be replaced by some U.S. expert? He would hardly increase the  size of the damage, and the benefit would certainly be greater.  <H5>  Who Cost What, or How Much Does Democracy Cost? </H5>   The Central Electoral Commission has submitted an official  report, from which it can be seen that the 12 December elections  to the Federal Assembly and the referendum on the new  Constitution cost the country a "round sum" -- 120.7 billion  rubles. [passage omitted]    In the election campaign, despite a very strict ban,  extensive use was made of the funds of legal persons with  foreign participation. Here are some examples of illegal  donations ascertained by the Central Electoral Commission.    "Russia's Choice"    "Effektkredit" Joint-Stock Commercial Bank -- 3,000,000    "Sky Line" Russian-British Joint Venture -- 20,000,000    "Olbi-Diplomat" Joint-Stock Company -- 130,000,000    "Stolichnyy" Joint-Stock Commercial Bank -- 154,800,000    "Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin" Bloc    "Viamond LTD" Joint-Stock Company -- 30,000,000    "Torgovlya i Kredit" Joint-Stock Company -- 10,000,000    "Option" Joint-Stock Commercial Bank -- 10,000,000    What can you say here? Democracy is being squeezed out of  money bags....</p>

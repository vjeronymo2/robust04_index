			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Low key meeting for ICI demerger AT A low key extraordinary meeting yesterday, shareholders of Britain's biggest manufacturer, Imperial Chemical Industries, voted to dismantle the company. Sir Denys Henderson, chairman, defended the decision to spin off the bioscience division, Zeneca, as well as the way the demerger was handled. The meeting was attended by only about 300 people, and the giant ballroom at Grosvenor House was abandoned for a smaller location at the hotel. It was far from clear how many were shareholders and how many came from the legion of advisers and lawyers associated with the deal. Most criticisms of the demerger came from pensioners and individual shareholders. Some opposed the break-up of a company 67 years in the making. One shareholder described the meeting as the most historic in the company's history. Others criticised the amount paid to advisers and directors. When asked whether the two companies would be vulnerable to a hostile takeover, Sir Denys said the board had decided against poison-pills. 'The two companies will have to perform, helped by cost reductions and strategic positioning. That is the best assurance I can give,' he said. The debate, however, was academic. Sir Denys informed the shareholders that of the 236m proxy votes cast 235m were in favour. The motion was carried with only about 30 people voting against. Zeneca shares will be listed on the London Stock Exchange on Tuesday, when dealing is expected to start. Shares in Imperial Chemical Industries ended the last day in their current form down 11p at Pounds 12.44. On the grey market Zeneca when-issued shares closed down 8p at 632p ex-rights. Zeneca nil-paid rights ended 7p lower at 37p.</p>

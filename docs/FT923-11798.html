			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / Building freeze nearer in West Bank and Gaza THE Israeli government is today set to entrench temporary measures taken to stem new building in Jewish settlements in the occupied territories, moving closer to Arab demands for a complete settlement freeze and US conditions for the release of Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.2bn) in loan guarantees to Israel. Yesterday, the housing ministry confirmed that in addition to a temporary freeze imposed last week on unsigned contracts for government-backed housing, it had also this week ordered a halt to projects in the West Bank and Gaza Strip where contracts had been signed, but construction work was not yet in progress. Mr Avraham Shochat, the finance minister, and Mr Binyamin Ben Eliezer, housing minister, will meet today to formulate the extent of a new building freeze and review the possibility of halting some programmes where construction is underway. Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the prime minister, has avoided spelling out how far he is prepared to go in freezing settlement activity. Although committed to extensive curbs, he has tended to exclude settlements in the Golan Heights, the Jordan Valley and the Jerusalem area which he classifies as 'security settlements', against 'political' or ideological settlements. However far it turns out he is prepared to go, there are strong pressures other than the weight of US and Arab opinion pushing Mr Rabin towards deep cuts. The over-inflated housing programmes commissioned to cope with mass immigration from the former Soviet Union by the previous government of Mr Yitzhak Shamir demand radical measures to stem costs and over-supply. In these circumstances, settlements in the occupied territories, where relatively few Israelis and few immigrants want to live, are an obvious target for the axe. Finance ministry estimates put the cost of redeeming guarantees to contractors to buy back unsold apartments at up to Shk4bn (Pounds 842m) 6 - or about 5 per cent of the 1992 budget. With the US pressing Israel to contain its fiscal deficits as a further condition for the loan guarantees, it is the kind of expenditure that Mr Rabin has to control. The attention on last week's initial building freeze focused on the occupied territories. What was less noticed was that it applied to all new contracts inside Israel as well. Only about one-fifth of some 60,000 government-commissioned units said to be under construction and about half of the 5,000 contracts awaiting signature are in the West Bank and Gaza. Mr Shochat and Mr Ben Eliezer will have to halt or curtail any building projects inside Israel 'proper' as well as in the occupied territories. But, given the political climate over the settlements in the West Bank and Gaza, it is inevitable that these will bear the brunt of the cuts.</p>

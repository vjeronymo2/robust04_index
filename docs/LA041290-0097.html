			<p><P> April 12, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 2 PILOTS IN JET CRASH TO FLY IF TESTS ARE OK  </P> <P> The captain and co-pilot of a USAir jetliner that crashed at La Guardia Airport  last year can fly again if they pass recertification tests, the pilots and the  Federal Aviation Administration have agreed.  </P> <P> The FAA had revoked the captain's license of Capt. Michael Martin and suspended  the license of co-pilot Constantine Kleissas, who was at the controls before  their Boeing 737 slid off a runway Sept. 20, killing two.  </P> <P> Both agreed to drop their appeals of the FAA's action, meaning they can apply  for recertification sooner than they could have otherwise, an FAA spokeswoman  said Tuesday.  </P></p>

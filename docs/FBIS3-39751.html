			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Text" of speech delivered by Federal Chancellor Helmut </F> Kohl on the Day of Medium-Sized Industrial Enterprises of the  Federal Association of German Industry in Magdeburg on 19  January: "Medium-Sized Enterprises -- Driving Force of the  Social Market Economy"]    [Text]  <H6>  I. </H6>   Minister President, dear Mr. Necker, Mayor, Deputies, Ladies  and Gentlemen: First, I would like to seize the opportunity to  wish all a happy new year. The year 1994 is an important one,  in which, in particular, the people here in the new laender are  facing further important steps in our joint future.    When the Federal Association of German Industry held the  first Day of Medium-Sized Industries after the reunification of  our fatherland in Leipzig in April 1991, German unity had been  completed only six months earlier. At that time, we were still  rather at the beginning of the task of establishing independent  medium-sized industrial enterprises in the new laender.    Those who look back at the developments of the past two  years  will realize that the will for independence has developed most  dynamically in the new laender. More than 600,000 companies  have been established, and thousands of successfully  reprivatized enterprises speak for themselves.    I would like to express my gratitude and recognition to the  entrepreneurs in eastern Germany. They have done a great job in  reconstruction, in many cases under tight deadlines and,  especially in the starting phase, also against certain obstacles.    I also would like to thank the enterprises in western  Germany  which, despite the slump in the economy, stuck to their  investment plans in the new laender. It is a pleasure for me to  say today that the business community's promise to double its  purchasing volume in the new laender to 50 billion German marks  [DM] from 1992 to 1995 so far has been kept.    A special word of thanks also goes to those who have  provided  assistance and support for creating jobs for apprentices in the  new laender over the past year. The chambers, but also the land  groups of the Federal Association of German Industry [BDI],  provided sufficient training opportunities in 1993.    The medium-sized enterprises are one centerpiece of the  social market economy. It is in the many medium-sized  enterprises in Germany that most people not only find  employment, but also where innovation takes place most rapidly  and frequently, where state-of-the-art products are developed,  and where new markets are explored. We know from 40 years of  experience that the strength and international success of the  German economy are based largely on the existence of a wide and  active foundation of medium-sized enterprises in Germany.    The medium-sized enterprises are, at the same time, a symbol  of individual entrepreneurial freedom and independence. This is  one of the reasons that the old regime in the former GDR tried  to destroy the medium-sized economy. It was only with  unification that the personal and economic freedom necessary for  wide development of business initiative was recreated.    I am glad that the second "Day of Industrial Medium-Sized  Enterprises" after reunification is taking place today in the  new laender. Representatives of medium-sized enterprises from  the old and new laender have come together here in Magdeburg for  an exchange of opinions, for discussing problems, and for  establishing the course of our joint future.    Ladies and Gentlemen, we must vigorously advance  developments  in the new laender in the future, too, and complete the internal  unity of Germany. Had I said five years ago that businessmen  from western and eastern Germany would hold a joint meeting here  in Magdeburg today, most people would have questioned my state  of mind.    Some have not realized yet that we are facing a major  challenge, a challenge unprecedented in history. What is  certain is that somewhat more than three years after  unification, we have made considerable progress on the path  toward internal unity.    After last year's dynamic increase, we are expecting the  economy in the new laender to grow between 6 and 8 percent this  year, too. In 1993, eastern Germany supported growth in all of  Germany and will do so in 1994, too. Until recently, hardly  anyone would have considered this to be possible.    According to a forecast presented by the Hamburg Economic  Research Institute last week, for the first time since  unification exports from eastern Germany will increase. The new  direction of exports, including exports to the West, shows that  the international competitive strength of the enterprises in  eastern Germany is increasing. The new laender already export  more goods to the countries of the European Union [EU] and EFTA  [European Free Trade Association] than to the former East Bloc,  which used to be their main client.    Meanwhile, public as well as private per capita investment  in  eastern Germany, is higher than in western Germany. This year,  even per capita investment in the construction industry will be  higher there than in western Germany.    This has become possible only through the Federal  Government's determined actions. The settlement of inherited  debts in housing construction, which was accomplished and is  mainly funded by the Federal Government, has given an enormous  impulse to investment. The number of construction licenses  increased enormously, from practically zero to an estimated  75,000 in 1993, doubling the 1992 figure.    Housing construction also increased significantly in western  Germany. According to provisional calculations, last year some  430,000 apartments were completed. This year we expect the  construction of half a million new apartments; this is the  highest figure in 16 years.    The Federal Government has increased rapidly and  significantly its financial efforts in all spheres since the  conclusion of unity. I would like to give a few, very  descriptive examples. In the last three and one-half years of  German unity, more telephone connections were made than in the  40 years of the GDR. Rapid communication also facilitates  investment! Within a few years a major development project was  brought under way, and I do not have any doubts that the  activities of the mail service will even be speeded up after the  postal privatization, for which I am yearning.    In order to transform the economy in the new laender and  create new, competitive jobs, existing enterprises must be  modernized and new, competitive enterprises created.    The Trust Agency has done a great job of privatizing  enterprises, and largely concluded its work by the end of last  year. Most of the more than 13,500 privatized enterprises were  sold to medium-sized firms.    In addition, the Trust Agency created a series of measures  especially designed to improve the economic outlook for the  newly established, medium-sized enterprises in the new laender.  These measures range from real estate offers to granting time  to pay the purchasing price and have served to promote the  development of medium-sized industry in the new laender.    In the sphere of trade we are experiencing particularly  rapid  development. In this area, privatization was concluded two and  one-half years ago. This has meant great progress not only for  the business community but also for the consumers in eastern  Germany: Today any consumer can buy virtually everything he  wants in his immediate neighborhood.    The Federal Government is firmly determined to continue its  policy of promoting large-scale investment at a high level.  This is a really promising course for effectively supporting  the emergence of new, competitive economic structures and jobs  in eastern Germany.    One example that I would like to mention in this connection  is the investment grant, which we created, or the billions in  credits we granted for the founding of companies and  investments. Regarding public orders, we have introduced  preferential treatment to enterprises from eastern Germany. The  Federal Government, meanwhile, is places a fair share of its  orders in eastern Germany.    Of course, there are still many difficulties, which you  experience daily in your personal vicinity: Necessary changes  sometimes progress slowly and in some cases these are still  obstacles with which to contend. We must not close our eyes to  the fact that 40 years of division have left deeper traces than  we assumed. This simply cannot be undone with a few  declarations. Today I am more convinced than ever that the  decisive challenge as far as German unity is concerned is the  meeting between people, the coexistence between people in  Germany. Thus, I am asking all of you, all of us, wherever we  are, to do everything to make us talk with one another and not  about each other, so that those who have much to go through will  not forget that prosperity in the old FRG did not come overnight  but was the result of 40 years of hard work.    I also understand the working people who are worried about  the future of their jobs. This is why the Federal Government is  backing the necessary process of structural adaptation through  its active labor market policy. This is how millions of people  could be prevented from becoming unemployed in the next few  years. Behind these naked figures stand the fates of many  individuals and their families, who could be helped in this way.  Despite some criticism, I stand by this active labor market  policy as the expression of a real social market economy. After  all, German unity does not only mean introducing cold capitalism  in eastern Germany. What we want is a social market economy as  defined by Ludwig Erhard. It is true we are still losing old  jobs. Nevertheless, more and more we are able to replace these  with new, competitive jobs.    Ladies and Gentlemen: For many people in the new laender the  personal situation has improved. Since the introduction of  monetary, economic, and social union in May 1990, incomes of  private households in eastern Germany have almost doubled; last  year, they almost reached 70 percent of the western level. This  is an unprecedented process of catching up!    Regardless of all achievements we have made in the  reconstruction of the new laender, we must not ignore the fact  that in many areas there is still a lot of unsatisfied demand.    Of course, the large amounts of money we are investing  currently in the new laender will lead to the emergence of  blossoming regions in the new laender. There can be absolutely  no doubt about that, even though it might take a few years  longer than we originally thought. Yet, if this is the only  point in which I was wrong, then I can be quite content.    Despite all our efforts, we must recognize that first and  foremost the two sides of industry are shaping the opportunities  and prospects for work and employment. It is up to you and your  decisions to give real priority to employment and jobs. This  does not only apply to the new laender but to all of Germany.    I expressly welcome the fact that both sides of industry  have  recently shown readiness to be flexible. The first wage  agreement for 1994, which has now been achieved in the western  German chemical industry, has had an impact on public service,  by the way. This agreement gave priority to the objective of  jobs, which is good.    One thing I would like to emphasize is the agreement on  flexible working hours of 35 to 40 hours a week. Also of  particular importance are the special agreements for people  entering professional life or for the long-term unemployed.    For the first time, industry and labor have reached concrete  agreements that take into consideration differing efficiency and  thus are making it easier for enterprises to hire new people.    I think that the agreement in the chemical industry  contributes to the creation of more jobs, and should serve as a  model for others industries, too. In practical terms, this is  solidarity shown by those who have a job for those who are  finding it difficult to find one.    Flexible working hours can help extend machine running times  and create more part-time jobs. Now it will finally be possible  to increase the offer of part-time jobs. In other  industrialized nations this has been common practice for a long  time. In the Netherlands, for example, almost one out of every  three people employed works part time. Labor exchanges for  part-time jobs have even become an independent branch there.    Surveys have shown that in our country interest in part-time  jobs is much greater than what is being offered. Industry and  labor should take into consideration more strongly than in the  past that part-time work offers a major potential for more  employment in Germany.  <H6>  II. </H6>   Ladies and Gentlemen, I have mentioned this example since  today priority has to be given to preserving jobs and to  creating new jobs in the whole of Germany. Particularly in the  old laender structural weaknesses in the economy and the society  have accumulated in the course of the past few years. These  problems have nothing to do with German unity.    Demographic developments the average number of years an  individual works have profound consequences in the long run, for  example, for the labor market and the social security systems.  Dramatic changes in the age structure of the German population  after the turn of the millennium already are beginning to show.  Today Germany has one of the lowest birthrates in the world.  In 2030, presumably every third person will be over 60 years  old. Considering today's 1.8 million serious nursing cases,  nursing-care insurance is increasingly urgent. Therefore, we  will push it through -- we will also push through that the  ancillary wage costs will not be increased.    In order to ensure Germany's competitiveness as a business  location for the future, we jointly have to do everything to  overcome these structural weaknesses. The securing of the  business location is not only the Federal Government's business;  both sides of industry, the enterprises, the social groups, and  every individual citizen are called upon to live up to their  responsibility for the future.    It is now time for us to do everything that is overdue. For  that purpose, familiar paths have to be abandoned. However, if  we really want to say yes to the future, we have to be able to  do what is necessary today and not to postpone it any longer.  This is particularly important because of changes in the world  economy. Competition has become stronger. However, this does  not mean we have deteriorated, only that others have improved.  This applies not only to the Asiatic regions of growth, but  also to all countries of Central, East, and southeastern Europe.  After all, we want democracy and market economics to be  introduced there and these countries to recover again. However,  if they are successful, they will also become competitors. We  have to be prepared for this.    Last year, the Federal Government made several, also  unpopular decisions for the securing of our future. Property  cuts were unavoidable, claims had to be pushed back. However,  only in this way can we preserve the bases of our social  security in the long run.    But for me one field has to be excluded: pensions. Pensions  are not a charitable gift of the state. People have worked for  them their whole life. Therefore, we were not only guided by  economic considerations when we decided to take over pensions  for older people in the new laender. We owe special solidarity  to the generation of the people who are today 60 or 70 years  old. These people primarily carried the burden of the war and  were cheated out of better living conditions in the GDR.    As you know, the topic of savings also includes combating  social services abuses. Here, the campaign initiated by the  Federal Employment Office, the trade unions, and employers last  spring has been impressively successful. The number of cases of  abuse of services and illegal employment being investigated by  the employment offices increased by almost 50 percent. In this  way, by the end of November, a savings of almost DM1.2 billion  was achieved. This shows that there was and still is a burning  need for action. And this equally applies to tax evasion and  subsidy fraud.    Ladies and Gentlemen, regarding savings and the combating of  abuse, social cuts are not at issue, as some claim. A change in  the people's way of thinking, reshuffles, and reorientation are  required. Because of the enormous expenses for the new laender,  we now have the opportunity to advance the development speedily.  However, this also took the public budget to the limit of its  capacity.    Yesterday and the day before yesterday the Federal  Government  and the coalition resolved two things: On the one hand, we  agreed on specific, additional savings of DM5 billion in the  budget. I need not explain that this was not easy after about  DM21 billion had already been saved in the 1994 Federal Budget.  In this way, we wish to stress that the stability of state  finances is unrenounceable for us. For me stability also means  the inflation rate will go down further; I regard it an enormous  success that last year we achieved for the first time a rate in  the 3-percent range -- here I am also particularly grateful to  the Bundesbank.    On the other hand, yesterday we agreed on an "action program  for more growth and employment." I refrain from explaining the  measures to you in detail; those of you who have not yet read it  will certainly do so some time.    From my point of view, the intention of the Federal  Government to continue its deregulation policy with the  objective of shortening the planning and authorization process  in Germany is particularly important.    This program is apt to accelerate the economic recovery  which  is becoming noticeable and, at the same time, permanently  improve the conditions of Germany as a business location. It  relieves the enterprises and facilitates the securing and  creation of jobs.    With this action program, we also are implementing essential  measures we announced last September at the time of our report  on securing the future of Germany as a business location.    Notwithstanding the election year, these decisions are  absolutely necessary for securing the future. I have always  said we must not lose any time in securing jobs in Germany. For  me, the postponement of such important measures for the future  is not possible because, in this way, we would betray our future.    We already implemented a large part of the measures  contained in last lyear's report on Germany as a business  location. I would like to mention the following  examples:     -  The law on facilitating investment and land for  housing construction and the law on facilitating planning are  making the planning and authorization processes, which were  often too long and complicated before, far easier. I  immediately add the following: Far more could be done here.  However, for this we above all need the cooperation of the  laender, because they determine public administration in the  federal system.    -  After a long struggle, the amendment to the  genetic technology law has been achieved. This has also cleared  the way for the idea that research and innovation again have  priority -- without exceeding the limit of what is morally  permitted.    -  Because of the railroad reform, the way is cleared  for the reorganization of the railroads into a modern  transportation system under entrepreneurial leadership. In this  way, we have atoned for the omissions of the past 25 years.    We are firmly determined to make purposeful progress in  implementing during the current legislative period additional  pending measures recommended in the Report on Safeguarding  Germany as an Industrial Location in the Future. This includes  conclusion of the postal reform, in order to strengthen our  competitive position in the telecommunications markets, which  are growing with enormous speed all over the world.    The public response to our Report on Safeguarding Germany as  an Industrial Location in the Future is more than encouraging.  It shows that we have tackled a central topic for labor and  employment.    Ladies and Gentlemen, essential preconditions for  safeguarding the competitiveness of German industry are  future-oriented private investments and successful enterprise  strategies. In addition to reducing production costs, it is the  task of the companies to help new products gain a breakthrough  and develop new markets.    We Germans are international leaders in environmental  technology and in the development of new materials. What is  possible in these areas can also be achieved in other fields  that are important for the future.    However, in this we must always keep in mind that not  everything that is technically and scientifically feasible is  also ethically and morally permitted. The same goes for the  relationship between economy and ecology.    However, Ladies and Gentlemen, a country like ours also  needs  a climate that is friendly for technology. Creating this  atmosphere is one of the important tasks in educating the young  generation. In particular, we must once again impart to  students the feeling that technological top achievements are  something that we can be proud of -- just as athletic top  achievements naturally fill us with pride. Therefore, here, too,  we need to cultivate the elites.  <H6>  III. </H6>   Ladies and Gentlemen, responsibility for one's own actions,  courage for entrepreneurial risks, and readiness for innovation  -- all these are qualities which characterize the independent  medium-sized industries in our country -- are also needed in  other spheres of our society.    I am confident that together we will master the challenges  we  are facing. We must recognize the signs of the time; we must  open up new leeway for action for our country. This is also a  precondition for enabling us to make use of new opportunities we  will face in the future. The new international changes offer  excellent opportunities in particular to us Germans.    The recently achieved conclusion of GATT is of outstanding  importance for us. It is the most comprehensive liberalization  package of past decades. Without liberalization of  international trade relations, a country like the FRG that is so  strongly integrated into international economy, would be hit in  its vital nerve center.    This month the second stage of economic and monetary union  came into effect. As a result, Europe continues to grow  together in terms of economic and financial policy. About 70  percent of our products go the countries of the European  Community and EFTA -- this is a strong argument in favor of the  emerging Europe. Our economic future is most closely linked  with the process of European integration.    The decision to name Frankfurt/Main the seat of the European  Monetary Institute, and thus of the future European Central  Bank, is convincing proof of trust in us Germans. At the same  time, this decision is an important symbol of the fact that a  future European currency must be as stable as the German mark.    Ladies and Gentlemen, what is of concern to me at the moment  is, however, something else. There is a widespread view that,  after all the things that have happened, war has been banished  from our region forever. This is what people also thought in  the 1920's when Aristide Briand and Gustav Stresemann received  the Nobel Prize as the architects of the new peace. Evening  after evening I see the horrible pictures from the former  Yugoslavia, where people, who have lived together for  generations, are attacking each other. There are also worrying  reports from the area of the former Soviet Union. There some  people once again think that borders can be shifted by force.    If we want to overcome borders, we must bring people  together. I give you an example from my homeland, the  Palatinate. There, Palatines and Alsatians live together as  Germans and French and Europeans. This is what Thomas Mann said  a long time ago: We are German Europeans and European Germans.    We want Europe to be our protection and shield for the  future. Therefore, we must understand this development as an  opportunity; this also is particularly true for German  unification. Here I categorically oppose the stupid pessimism  that is currently spreading. We must overcome it and make use  of our opportunities. We must act with courage and  determination, with those principles and virtues that have made  our country great, with humaneness, loyalty, industriousness,  and reliability.    Ladies and Gentlemen, I would like to cordially invite you  to  follow this path together with us, to understand it together  with us, and to act accordingly.</p>

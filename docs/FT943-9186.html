			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / UK Company News: GPA shores up balance sheet with Dollars 1bn package GPA, the aircraft leasing company, has successfully launched a Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) aircraft lease portfolio securitisation package which should substantially strengthen its balance sheet and enable it to meet the terms of the financial restructuring worked out with its bank creditors in October 1993. Alps 94-1 as it is known (the first is called alps 92-1) is being fully underwritten by Lehman Brothers, and is a Dollars 998.2m securitisation, which will acquire 27 aircraft from GPA's fleet of 480. The 27 aircraft have an average lease life of five years, and the seven tranches of investment-grade bonds and securities amounting to Dollars 782m within the alps 94-1 package, have been designed to match the leases in terms of maturity and return. The Dollars 782m is split 53 to 47 in fixed and floating interest rates with coupons ranging from Libor plus 48 basis points for the variable rate notes, to Treasuries plus 100 basis points for the fixed rate notes. Some Dollars 71.2m of class D (unrated) notes are being bought by General Electric Capital Corporation and Dollars 144.5m of class E notes by a subsidiary of GPA, to complete the Dollars 1bn package. Mr Patrick Blaney, chief executive of GPA, said the alps launch 'represents a giant step for GPA. It is a continuation of the work we started with the restructuring last October, and will continue the process of GPA's recovery'. The restructuring requires GPA to repay Dollars 700m to Dollars 900m of principal on Dollars 3bn debt up to the end of 1996 plus interest. Mr Blaney said the new package would enable GPA to meet the terms of that restructuring. The group has no commitments to purchase new aircraft from Boeing or Airbus before 1997, or with McDonnell Douglas before 1995. Deliveries of the latter may be postponed.</p>

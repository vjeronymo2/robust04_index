			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / International Company News: Euro Disney banks call meeting on rescue deal Euro Disney's creditor banks will meet today in Paris for a special summit meeting to map out their strategy for the final stage ofnegotiations over a financial rescue package for the ailing leisure group. The banks, which include J. P. Morgan, Deutsche Bank and National Westminster, had originally hoped at the meeting to discuss an investigative audit of Euro Disney that they have commissioned from KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy company. However, KPMG has been unable to finalise its audit allegedly becauseof Euro Disney's reluctance to release information. It has instead prepared a preliminary report. The final audit is scheduled for completion in two weeks. The banks have asked KPMG to analyse Euro Disney's financial position and its future requirements to verify information given to them by Disney at a meetingin November. Banking sources suggest that so far KPMG's findings do not differ greatly from the Disney figures. This means that the banks are likely to press for a swift resumption of negotiations with Disney. The US group has already tabled proposals to halve Euro Disney's FFr20.3bn (Dollars 3.4bn) debt by raising FFr10bn through a rights issue and debt-for-equity swap. However, the banks are keen that Disney should share the burden of the rescue. They will today discuss plans to reduce its entitlement to royalties from Euro Disney and possibly to inject capital by purchasing assets. The banks will also be briefed ontheir legal position by Gide-Loyrette-Nouelle, their lawyers. Meanwhile Adam, a French pressure group that represents minority shareholders, is lobbyingfor the convertible bond holders (who hold FFr4bn of Euro Disney's debt) to seethe KPMG report and to be represented in the negotiations. The talks could be further complicated by continuing sales of Euro Disney debt on the US second-hand loans market. Midland Bank last month sold a FFr130m portion of debt for60 per cent of its original value and a second sale is now nearing completion. Another sale, planned for last week, collapsed at the eleventh hour following a dispute over the entitlement to voting rights.</p>

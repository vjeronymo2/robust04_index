			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Excerpt" of Interview with Yevhen Marchuk, minister of </F> state for the Ukrainian National Security Service, by  unidentified correspondent on 26 May; place not given --  originally carried on Ukrainian television program "Pravo"]    [Text] [Correspondent] Yevhen Kyrylovych, my colleagues  and some politicians have immediately rushed, in my opinion,  into christening the developments in Crimea to be an acute  crisis, as it were. Does this in your view as a professional  correspond with reality and how does the Security Service feel  in the present situation in Crimea?    [Marchuk] In spite of the atmosphere there in this episode  in  particular and that surrounding the service -- the former  security service of Crimea -- in general, the people we are  working with are high-standard professionals, rather than  (?hysterical) nervous wrecks, which is why situations like this,  as they say, do not make us feel at a loss. To date, the  National Security Service of Ukraine has fulfilled the  requirements of Ukrainian President Leonid Makarovych Kravchuk's  directive of 18 May on reforming the Crimean security service  and setting up on the basis of that service the Security Service  of Ukraine Main Directorate in Crimea.    The president in this particular case exercised his  constitutional right. In accordance with Article 114.5, the  president as a guarantor of the Constitution, territorial  integrity, and national security, has the right to reorganize --  I would like to emphasize that this is exactly what that article  in the Constitution points out -- to create, reorganize, and  disband various executive power establishments such as  ministries, departments, and so on. The security service is a  branch of executive power and it is exactly on the basis of  those requirements in that article of the Constitution that the  reorganization was carried out.    What does it mean? It means that a Security Service of  Ukraine subdivision is in action in Crimea. It functional  duties, structure, and numerical strength, however, have not  been altered. I, incidentally, informed Crimean President  Meshkov about this in writing in a telegram. And secondly...    [Correspondent] As for -- I beg your pardon -- as for the  accusations that the Security Service of Ukraine and its  subdivisions in Crimea are now pursuing an anti-Crimean policy  and engaging in anti-Crimean activities, can you respond to  these accusations and can you say if they conform to reality?    [Marchuk] This, as they say, is a preplanned misinformation  because, as I have already said, neither the functional duties  nor the structure or the numerical strength of this subdivision  have been changed. And the priority tasks of this subdivision  remain as they were before: to combat corruption, organized  crime, protect the economy, and protect civil peace in Crimea.  However, at present, unfortunately, by virtue of the  circumstances which are now taking place in Crimea we had to  slightly shift emphasis and give priority to carrying out the  work which is necessary to ensure civil peace and ease tensions  in society. And, without fail, one of our principal tasks is to  provide the bodies of power with information...    [Correspondent] By the way, I would like to ask you how does  the Security Service build relations with the local  administration?    [Marchuk] ...today -- I have not completed the sentence --  to  provide the bodies of power with information about the most  vital problems of Crimea, as, by the way, is the case with all  our territorial subdivisions. In this respect we changed  nothing. As we were providing information before, the Main  Directorate of the Ukrainian Security Service in Crimea now  informs the leading bodies of Crimea in writing, both the  president and the Supreme Council, about issues which, even at a  local level, the issues which are of vital importance for Crimea.    Two written reports of this kind have been made today. In  all, a few reports have been made in the last few days since 18  May when the status of the [Crimean] security service was  changed and it was reorganized.    Because there is a very large number of various  insinuations,  I would like to emphasize and to some extent explain why the  president of Ukraine took that decision. You know that a  decision of that kind was also taken in relation to Internal  Affairs Ministry structures, but I would only like to speak on  the security service.  The thing is that the Crimean leadership made two attempts,  unilaterally and without any coordination with Kiev. The first  one was the attempt to give the chair of the head of the  Security Service of Crimea to a former or retired military  general who had been chief of staff of the XXXII Army Corps.  But in compliance with our law, the security service of Crimea,  as all territorial bodies, is a constituent part of the single  security system, which is, by the way, the case with all  countries, even federative ones. Then the second attempt.    [Correspondent] A relevant militarization, so to say, of the  power-wielding structures. Am I right?    [Marchuk] Yes, you are right. To be more precise and to  compare the two actions, the first one being the appointment of  the former commander of the XXXII Army Corps minister of  internal affairs by the president of Crimea and then by the  Supreme Council [of Crimea], and then the attempts to give, as I  have already said, the chair of the chief of the Security  Service of Ukraine to the former chief of staff of this XXXII  Army Corps; that is to say, he is also a former military  general. And it became clear that the leadership of Crimea was  embarking on the road of militarization of the power-wielding  structures; that is, these former, retired generals, as it had  probably been planned, were supposed to establish order in  Crimea.    You can understand what it means when generals in retirement  establish order on such a small territory as the Crimean  autonomous region. No great deal of forecasting need be made  here, as they say, because it is already known what kind of  heroic deeds have now been undertaken by the internal affairs  minister as a result of his unprofessional actions, which he  himself, incidentally, admitted saying that he was not a  professional (?in that field).    [Correspondent] Once we have started disproving rumors and  some unverified information, can you refute reports by some of  the media on spetsnaz troops being deployed in Crimea, on  bringing National Guard units to full combat alert, and so on,  as the list is endless? And incidentally, as a professional,  what in your view are these allegations aimed at?    [Marchuk] Before I answer this question I would like to  underline, and I want all citizens of Ukraine to know this,  first and foremost those who reside in Crimea: The Security  Service of Ukraine as a whole and all its subdivisions and the  Main Directorate of the Security Service in Crimea -- I am  saying this with absolute responsibility and officially -- is  one of the factors of stabilization of the situation in Crimea.    I have already said that we had to do and we now have to do  much, even here in Kiev, so as to neutralize and alleviate the  situation in Crimea. I will provide the following example.    Quite often I speak with various Crimean leaders, including  president Meshkov, and so on. But most often I have to talk  with the Black Sea Fleet commander Eduard Dmytrievich Baltin,  because you understand that such a gigantic military structure  is stationed there and the situation in Crimea will very much  depend on how it behaves.    During one of our conversations he complained: Yevgeniy  Kirilovich, you understand, how should I, as a serviceman, as  the one responsible for the fleet, perceive this, for example,  report that in the vicinity of some village in Kherson Oblast a  hospital is being deployed to receive those wounded by shrapnel,  that in the vicinity of some village in Odessa oblast a hospital  is being deployed, allegedly the hospital of the Odessa military  district is being deployed according to a war-time scale, that  attacks are being prepared against the Black Sea Fleet riverine  brigade's ships in Izmail.    It took me no more than 20 minutes to immediately give the  task to our directorates in Odessa and Kherson and to the  military counter-intelligence and then to contact the minister  of defense, Radetskyy, to clear up in 20 minutes that this is an  outright lie -- excuse me for this word. But someone is  bringing it to the knowledge of the Black Sea Fleet commander.    Incidentally, you and we are in a way colleagues in that,  being professionals, both you and we operate primarily on the  basis of information. It seems to me, however, that that  information has a somewhat specific character and just a  journalist without a prompt from a specialist would simply not  be able to present or invent it. This is someone being used as a  mouthpiece and the mass media have spread this misinformation  with a particular aim. But what is this aim, (?I would like to  ask)?    After that conversation with Baltin, tension was eased, as  it  were. I, by the way, had some information too.    [Correspondent] As a challenge?    [Marchuk] As a challenge. I had some information about a  plane from Moscow, incidentally with a spetsnaz group on board  too, flying towards one of his airfields. As officials, I trust  Baltin and he trusts me. We may withhold something from each  other but I do not think we could tell untruths. At least I do  not do this.    So literally within 20 to 30 minutes we disposed of much of  the information that was causing tension. Some two-and-a-half  to three hours later, however, with a map and a sound  accompaniment on top of it all, and I am told by our staff in  Crimea about whom this all benefits and who presents this  information this way.    From the point of view of a professional, all this,  unfortunately, is very simple: All this is qualified as  information of a purposeful nature, popularly known as  misinformation or, in even simpler terms, a lie. It is  presented, however, at a certain moment in time, in a certain  way and on a certain territory in order to -- it is aimed at  something after all -- to cause tension, intimidate, for  example, the Crimean leadership by saying: "You see what is  happening" and push someone towards some careless or even,  forgive me, hysterical actions.    However, unfortunately, those who were organizing this  so-called help to Crimea, those who thought they were helping  it, they did grave harm to Crimea. Very many applications from  other countries have been withdrawn by today. I do not know  exactly how many.    [Correspondent] Up to 15,000 according to information  available to me.    [Marchuk] I believe the losses suffered by Crimea will  amount  to hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not millions due to this  very information. It was spread all over the world. It was  spread all over the CIS countries. We already know that foreign  companies from the CIS countries cancelled many routes and tours.    So as they say, it was quite excessive, ostensibly  endeavoring to achieve a noble goal but at the same time, I  think, harming Crimea primarily by creating an atmosphere of  quite serious tension, if not a panic, and, secondly,  frightening off the people whose stay there could have generated  some revenues to the local budget.    [Correspondent] That is, to the detriment of their own?    [Marchuk] Mainly to the detriment of Crimea, rather than  that  of their own as they are not in Crimea. I think that there is a  way out of it after all but everyone should cool down, as they  say, and realize it is they themselves who are responsible for  their decisions.</p>

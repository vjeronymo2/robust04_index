In an interview published today in the Spanish newspaper  ABC,  Menem said: "Some kind of subversion has taken place in  Santiago del Estero, but measures were adopted and the incidents  are being investigated."    "The problem in Chiapas is ethnic and religious, something  that does not happen in Argentina. There is no possibility of  subversion here," Menem said.    "The incidents in Santiago del Estero were motivated by  infiltrators, which explains the statements made by Daniel  Ortega a few days ago in Cuba, in which he vindicated the armed  struggle and mentioned the events in Chiapas and Santiago del  Estero as an example."    "If Daniel Ortega mentioned Santiago del Estero as an  example, it is because people have been infiltrated there by  these elements, death traffickers, because subversion is without  doubt traffic in death."    When asked what the solution will be to the Aerolineas  Argentinas conflict with Iberia [Airlines], Menem said: "If the  problem is not solved by the day I arrive in Spain, of course we  will talk about it with the Spanish Government."    He also added that "of course" the Argentine Government  wants  Spain to continue, through Iberia, its participation in  Aerolineas.    "That is why we privatized the company. We are trying to  transfer the shares the government has (43 percent) in  Aerolineas. We will transfer 28 percent of the shares and keep  15 percent," Menem said.    He added: "If it is possible to privatize all the shares we  will do so, but meanwhile, since the adjudication of shares to  Iberia, the transfer of shares represents a form of  capitalization for the Spanish company, thereby allowing it to  continue operating in a more positive and fluent manner."</p>

			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / International Company News: Price war hits American Brands American Brands, the US cigarettes, spirits and consumer products group, said the price war in the US cigarette market was mainly responsible for a 20 per cent fall in fourth-quarter pre-tax profits to Dollars 187.4m. It also blamed fluctuations in exchange rates, primarily sterling, which it said were responsible for Dollars 10m of the profits downturn. Fourth-quarter turnover was up slightly to Dollars 3.82bn from Dollars 3.77bn, while earnings per share fell from Dollars 1.15 to 92 cents. For the full year, turnover fell to Dollars 13.7bn from Dollars 14.6bn, while net income fell to Dollars 668.2m from Dollars 883.8m before a charge for accounting adjustments of Dollars 198m. Earnings per share fell to Dollars 3.30 from Dollars 4.29 before adjustment and to Dollars 2.32 after adjustment. Results from non-tobacco operations were up 26 per cent for the quarter and 11 per cent for the year, the company said, but this did not compensate for sharp price cuts in the domestic cigarette market. The company said US tobacco operations had contributed Dollars 11m to results in the fourth quarter and that results in the first half of the current year were unlikely to compare favourably with last year. However, it expected their full-year contribution to be roughly the same as last year's.</p>

			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Chance for life in the dead zone: US and Russian pressure could improve the prospects for a Bosnian peace deal The 11th-hour Russian diplomatic initiative in Bosnia has made it increasingly unlikely that the Nato threat to launch air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs will be carried out. Formally, the Nato powers are sticking to their ultimatum of February 9. This stipulates that the Bosnian Serbs' gun positions around Sarajevo will be bombed if they do not withdraw their heavy weapons from a 20km (12-mile) exclusion zone around the city, or place them under United Nations control by tomorrow night. In practice, however, the decision by the Russians on Thursday to send 400 peacekeeping troops to bolster the UN force in Sarajevo, to be followed by another 400 later, gave the Bosnian Serbs the face-saving formula and sense of security they needed to withdraw their weapons. General Sir Michael Rose, the commander of UN forces in Bosnia, said that following the announcement of the agreement on Thursday evening between Mr Vitaly Churkin, deputy Russian foreign minister and special envoy to the Geneva peace conference, and Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, the pull-out of heavy weapons had become 'an exodus'. Yet only a few hours before his statement, which followed less convincing reports of a trickle of weapons which had been placed under UN control, it was by no means certain that the Nato deadline would be met. The Bosnian Serbs, though they appeared to be taking the Nato ultimatum more seriously than they had treated similar threats in the past, were clearly extremely reluctant to comply with demands made solely by the western alliance. They were comforted in their attitude by the critical stance adopted by the Russian leadership towards the Nato ultimatum. President Boris Yeltsin, harassed by his right-wing nationalist opponents and upset at not being consulted by Nato on an important issue affecting Russia's traditional Slav allies, was obliged to act to preserve his personal and his country's credibility. In the event, the Russian initiative turned out to be something of a diplomatic coup. It fulfilled three essential objectives, satisfying both the Russian and western positions: It reinforced Nato's demands by persuading the Bosnian Serbs to withdraw their weapons, while reassuring them that the weapons would not be abandoned; It will give Russia a more important role in forthcoming negotiations on a Bosnian peace settlement; More generally, it has re-established Russia as a player to be reckoned with on the international stage, at a time when it was beginning to be ignored by the west. It is virtually certain that these results would not have been obtained in the absence of the Nato ultimatum, itself something of an achievement in international diplomacy between the western nations. The 22-month-old Bosnian crisis has been littered by numerous similar threats of air strikes, all unfulfilled. If the latest in the long series has appeared more credible, it was because it was made by Nato as a whole with the strong support of the US, which has been conspicuous by its absence from the Bosnian conflict, as well as having a time-limit attached to it. Ironically, it was France and, in the last resort the UK, both opposed to air strikes when they were first proposed by Washington in May this year, which did all the pushing to get the US involved this time. In the case of France, by far the biggest contributor to the UN Protection Force in former Yugoslavia, the public outcry at the massacre in the central Sarajevo marketplace two weeks ago undoubtedly influenced the decision of a government already more inclined than others to use force in Bosnia. The UK's position has all along been more ambiguous, with the government, handicapped by a slim parliamentary majority, opposed to any action which could lead to the loss of life of British troops and cause further splits in the governing Conservative party. There were two main reasons why London finally changed its mind on air strikes. It did not want to be isolated within the Atlantic alliance and, above all, it wanted to avoid a rift with the US which had forged an uncustomary alliance with France on a vital foreign policy issue. Yet the most constructive aspect of French and British policy, pursued with confrontational Gallic vigour on the part of Paris and more discreet diplomatic finesse by London, was the desire to get the US more closely involved in the Bosnian conflict. The Bosnian Moslems, even when they were under severe pressure from the international mediators to make territorial concessions, had always put their faith in Washington not to back any plan they considered unviable. With both the US and Russia likely to play a much more prominent part in the peace negotiations in the future, the prospects of reaching a settlement have undoubtedly improved - on the assumption, of course, that each of the two powers is prepared to put pressure on its respective Bosnian allies to make the necessary compromises. The breakthrough is, however, only the beginning of what is bound to be a long process. The next few days will be crucial in setting out a coherent agenda, not only for bringing all sides back to the negotiating table in Geneva, but ending the fighting throughout the republic. What happens in Sarajevo could be a test case. In addition to the withdrawal of the Bosnian Serbs' heavy weapons, UN officials said yesterday they wanted the siege of the city to be lifted. This would mean removing road blocks, allowing humanitarian aid to get through, and restoring water, electricity and communications to the city. As Gen Rose has repeatedly said, the complete demilitarisation of the city would require more troops. But western governments are reluctant to send reinforcements. Mr James Gow of the Centre for Defence Studies at King's College, London, says the crucial factor in extending demilitarisation to the rest of the country is the attitude of the Bosnian government, which 'must be persuaded that it is in its interests to settle for a peace plan'. Achieving the latter might prove tricky. The Bosnian government has already expressed reservations about Russia's presence in Sarajevo, on the grounds that Moscow is considered pro-Serb. The Moslems were seeking, above all, western military intervention at a time when the Bosnian army was building up a disciplined and well-trained infantry superior to the Serb forces. This option has been pre-empted by the arrival of Russian peacekeepers, since nobody will launch air strikes while they are monitoring Serbian positions. 'The Bosnians trust only the Americans. To secure an overall peace settlement, the US will have to move quickly. The Bosnians may have to recognise the limitations of what they have achieved,' added Mr Gow. The current peace plan on the table in Geneva involves the division of Bosnia-Hercegovina into three ethnic statelets, with a clear bias towards rewarding Serb and Croat territorial gains. The UN forces are anxious that the peace talks should reflect developments on the ground. They have no mandate to monitor Bosnian Serb weapons outside the Sarajevo exclusion zone. 'Those weapons can be moved anywhere in eastern and central Bosnia where the fighting continues unabated,' a Nato diplomat said. 'The pressure now is tremendous,' a UN official conceded. 'All sides, knowing that we are concentrating on Sarajevo, could beat the hell out of each other in other parts of the country so as to secure territorial gains before we turn our attention beyond the capital.' The UN objectives are: Lifting the siege in Sarajevo; Lifting the sieges of Srebrenica, Zepa, Gorazde, and Tuzla in central and eastern Bosnia; Continuing Russian pressure on the Serbs and US pressure on the Moslems to make compromises on reaching a peace accord; Increasing pressure on Croatia to withdraw its troops from Mostar, the regional capital of western Hercegovina, which, unlike Sarajevo, has been almost reduced to rubble. 'I have no doubt that this will involve tens of thousands of peacekeeping troops,' a former senior military adviser to the British government said yesterday. 'And just because Nato threatened the use of force only in Sarajevo, there is no reason that Nato, and especially Washington, cannot apply the threat to other cities, although that will require the backing of the Russians.' Nato and UN officials yesterday said none of these aims could be achieved without persuading all the protagonists that it is in their interests to stop the fighting, including the patron states of Serbia and Croatia. 'It is clear that President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia wants international economic sanctions against his country lifted,' a Nato diplomat said yesterday. 'But any talk of that is too early. We have to keep the pressure on.' He added that Croatia could be brought to the negotiating table because the threat of economic sanctions remains. But the Bosnian government would only stop the fighting if the US could guarantee a permanent and more just peace settlement, he said. The setting up of a civilian administration by the UN could be the next step for Sarajevo. 'This is what we did in Cambodia,' said a UN official. But such an arrangement would require large numbers of personnel. 'More than that,' said Mr Gow, 'it is only the Americans who can tie up the whole thing.' Washington has said it would provide peacekeepers under UN auspices, if and when a negotiated peace settlement is reached. 'The Russians are on board. It is time for the US to help secure this peace. This is the last chance for peace,' the Nato diplomat said. 'We must capitalise on the previous few days. But then, our record in failing to grasp the moment in the Bosnian crisis is truly miserable.'</p>

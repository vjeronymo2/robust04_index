			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with French Defense Minister Francois Leotard by </F> Charles Lambroschini; place and date not given]    [Text] [Lambroschini] At the NATO summit, everybody once  again hid behind each other. The Americans want the air strikes  which Europe is rejecting. The Europeans are demanding an  American presence on the ground, which Washington is rejecting.  When and how can we break out of this paralysis?    [Leotard] First, I would like to reject the word paralysis.  It seems unfair to me to say that the UN forces are paralyzed  when, under very difficult conditions, they are fulfilling their  mission as defined by the United Nations: in other words the  escorting of humanitarian convoys. Our soldiers in particular,  by their self-denial, their behavior, their courage, are  bringing honor to our country and its finest traditions.    It is only thanks to their actions that more than 2 million  people in Bosnia are being fed. Similarly, I dispute the  statement that Europe is rejecting air strikes: Instead, it was  France which, during the vote on Resolution No. 836 establishing  protected areas, ensured that there was a provision that the  UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] could resort to air strikes in  the framework of its mission.    In a more general way, France has constantly stepped up its  diplomatic or military initiatives and advocated a firmer stance  toward the warring sides. It strengthened its contingent, when  asked to do so following a European Council meeting in June  1993. It must be noted that our allies did not follow our  example.    At the NATO summit, France again gave the international  community a lead in the direction of a firmer stance toward the  aggressor, including the use of air strikes. And I note that  our lead was followed, because the summit's final declaration  takes up the French idea of opening Tuzla airport, by force if  necessary, and also relieving the Canadian contingent isolated  by the Serbs in Srebrenica. This is how the UNPROFOR, and hence  the international community, will restore its credibility.    [Lambroschini] On the pretext that the political deadlock  must be noted and the Blue Helmets withdrawn accordingly, are  the French and the Europeans not accepting the fait accompli?  In other words Serbian expansionism?    [Leotard] In the present situation, France does not intend  to withdraw its blue helmets from Bosnia. If the UNPROFOR left,  Sarajevo would fall tomorrow, the whole of Bosnia would be  engulfed in flames, humanitarian aid would end, and the conflict  would be likely to spread to the Balkans. That would be to  abandon our responsibilities. However, we will not remain in  Bosnia indefinitely. That is common sense.    We must now make every effort to encourage the signing of an  agreement which establishes the existence of a Bosnian state,  probably of the confederal type. That is our priority.    There is no truly military solution to the conflict in the  former Yugoslavia. If we failed to end this atrocious war,  everything we have tried to build since 1945 which would be  undermined. We are defending a certain concept of man and his  dignity over there. Our army is not just defending national  territory, but also an immaterial territory of justice and law,  a concept of our place in the world, a heritage of values.    [Lambroschini] If the withdrawal of the blue helmets is  being envisaged, ought we not at least to have the courage to  lift the arms embargo, as the Muslims are demanding?    [Leotard] As long as there are men, blue helmets, on the  ground, the lifting of the arms embargo is the wrong solution.  Before the Muslims could take advantage of their arms, the  Serbs, who already have the military means, will have plenty of  time to defeat their enemy and our positions would be  untenable....    Let us not forget that it is thanks to the UNPROFOR that  Sarajevo is still standing. The lifting of the arms embargo  would therefore, paradoxically, mean first, an intensification  of the fighting with the resulting civilian casualties, and  second, a probable victory for the Serbs. We may be forced to  that point, but, I repeat, it would be the sign of the  international community's abdication, a desperate solution.</p>

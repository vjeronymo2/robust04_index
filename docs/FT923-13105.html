			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / World Trade News: Bush confident on Nafta progress PRESIDENT George Bush said yesterday, after a meeting in California with President Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico, that the US, Mexico and Canada were in the final phase of negotiations on an agreement to establish a North American free trade zone. Speaking at a joint news conference in San Diego, Mr Bush said he and Mr Salinas had told their trade negotiators to resume negotiations on the free trade pact (Nafta) on July 25. Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney also planned to send his representative to that meeting, Mr Bush said. This was by contrast with apparent prospects last week, when chief trade negotiators of the US, Canada and Mexico held a marathon series of meetings which ran till Saturday, but progress was slow. US trade officials were reported to have said talks might last through August or September. The US Congress must be given at least 90 days' notice of the president's intention to enter into a trade agreement. The upbeat tone from Mr Bush yesterday, after his meeting with Mr Salinas, suggests that the leaders could stage an attention-getting signature of the accord before the US presidential election is held on November 3. The two presidents are being lampooned on 50,000 baseball cards, distributed by anti-Nafta groups, which show them wearing baseball uniforms with the slogan: 'Don't let them throw you a curve (ball) - strike out Nafta.' Mexico has agreed to open its oil sector to 'performance contracts,' according to a report in the Mexican newspaper El Financiero. Under such a contract, an independent oil driller is paid a premium if it strikes oil. At present, Mexico only countenances 'service contracts' where the driller is paid a flat fee irrespective of the oil found. Mr George Baker of the University of California described the change in Mexico's position as the most significant event in the history of Mexican oil for 50 years. This concession would be a compromise between the US insistence that the oil sector be opened on a risk basis - where the successful driller assumes ownership of part of the oil it finds - and Mexico's view that such an opening would violate its nationalist constitution. Many oil companies prefer to operate on a risk, or failing that, performance basis, which gives them greater control over their operations. Also on the agenda for the two presidents was a recent and controversial US Supreme Court ruling, which upheld the kidnapping by US authorities of a Mexican doctor they wanted to arrest.</p>

			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / Hong Kong reform plan breaks agreements says China MR CHRIS PATTEN, Hong Kong's governor, was on a collision course with China last night after Beijing's foreign ministry said his proposals for Hong Kong's political development were deeply disturbing and would present obstacles to the smooth transfer of government in 1997. Wu Jianmin, the foreign ministry spokesman, said Mr Patten's plans for the colony's 1995 elections were in breech of the 1984 Anglo-Chinese Joint Declaration and the 1990 Basic Law, the Beijing-drafted constitution for Hong Kong after it reverts to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. 'They will surely present obstacles to Hong Kong's smooth transition and transfer of government. The Chinese side is deeply disturbed about this,' he said. On Wednesday, in an address to the local legislature, the governor proposed enlarging the franchise of the colony's voters in the 1995 elections. He drew short of advocating more than the 20 directly elected seats envisaged for the 60-member council in 1995, but sketched plans for making the election of the other 40 seats more democratic and open. Wu said China wished to point out that Beijing would not be held responsible for the consequences if the evolution of Hong Kong's political system did not accord with China's laws. He was critical of Mr Patten publicising plans before consulting China. At a public meeting last night Mr Patten, in the knowledge of Beijing's statement, denied that his plans violated bilateral Anglo-Chinese agreements. 'The proposals I made are entirely consistent with the Basic Law and the Joint Declaration in every particular,' he said to the applause from an audience of Hong Kong citizens. Earlier in the day, Mr Patten said his proposals for democratic reform must be decided by early next year. He said he hoped discussions with China would not be drawn out. During his first 'question time' before local legislators, Mr Patten spelt out what his government would do if agreement with China could not be reached about the financing of the colony's airport project. He said the government would have to look at some 'fairly radical options'. One would be to complete works that could be financed internally by the government and leave other matters to be completed by the post-1997 government, he said. This would mean shelving the construction of the airport and its connecting railway - the two most important parts of the HKDollars 163.7bn (Pounds 12bn) project. A tender for a HKDollars 9bn contract for the construction of the airport site expires next month and will have to be renegotiated if China does not agree the financing.

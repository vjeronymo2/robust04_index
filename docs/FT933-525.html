			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / International Company News: Poland poised to re-open tenders for telecom deals THE SALE last week of two Polish electronics plants to Siemens is set to trigger the announcement of new tenders by Telekomunikacja Polska (TP SA), the country's state-owned telephone monopoly, for regional telephone modernisation and extension contracts suspended while the Dollars 100m deal was being negotiated. The first tender is expected to be a contract worth over Dollars 50m for the Wroclaw region, for which Siemens will be bidding against AT&amp;T and Alcatel. The three companies have been promised access and the exclusion of other suppliers to the Polish market in return for purchasing local factories. Siemens' contract with the Polish government commits the company to Dollars 57m investment over six years in the ZWUT factory in Warsaw and the Elwro works in Wroclaw even if it fails to win any of the forthcoming contracts under the TP SA's Dollars 10bn investment programme. Siemens is contractually permitted to drop its investment plans for the two plants only if AT&amp;T were to buy a specified share of TP SA and the telephone company was then to grant a majority of domestic orders to the US supplier.</p>

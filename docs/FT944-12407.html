			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / International Capital Markets: GDR issues in India about to enter new phase The Indian government's announcement over the weekend that it is changing the rules for companies making international equity offers may mean the market for global depositary receipts issued by Indian companies is about to enter a new phase. The move was prompted by large inflows of foreign capital - about Dollars 2.1bn of Indian global depositary receipts (GDRs) have been issued so far this year - and the Indian government has acted on two fronts. First, it has said companies no longer need to use capital within 12 months of raising it. However, to slow the flow of funds into India, proceeds must now be kept abroad until they are needed. Second, the government has banned the use of warrants, which give investors the right to buy shares at a fixed price in the future. Issuing warrants was sometimes used to make offers more attractive, since they could be priced more cheaply than existing shares. 'You tended to use warrants when you needed to get the issue away,' said one banker involved with GDRs. Ending the use of warrants is likely to mean a two-tier market emerging for GDRs, some bankers believe. First-division companies will be able to raise capital successfully with GDRs but second division companies may struggle. Blue-chip companies like Bajaj Auto, the highly-successful Indian scooter maker, will always have a following among investors. However, GDRs issued by second-tier companies may join the 85 per cent of Indian GDRs trading at a discount to the local shares. 'There is a flight to quality and liquidity,' said one banker. Ironically, bankers agree that the need for action was prompted by the success of the Indian government's liberalisation programme, as companies have moved to take advantage of access to free-market international capital. 'This is a government that is not quite sure if the market should rule or whether it wants to control the market,' said a banker.</p>

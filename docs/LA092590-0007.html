			<p><P> September 25, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PANEL OKS FRYMAN CANYON PLAN;  </P> <P> DEVELOPMENT: THE VOTE BY THE PARKS COMMISSION IS THE FIRST OFFICIAL CITY HALL  ACTION TO IMPLEMENT A DEAL TO BUY THE LAND FROM DEVELOPER FRED SAHADI.  </P> <P> Los Angeles city parks commissioners Monday voted 5 to 0 to recommend spending  $1.2 million to help purchase 63-acre Fryman Canyon after Councilman Michael  Woo called the price tag "an excellent bargain" for parkland "so close to the  heart of the city."  </P> <P> The vote was the first official action at City Hall to implement a deal  negotiated by Woo and Mayor Tom Bradley to buy the canyon for $10.9 million  from developer Fred Sahadi, who otherwise plans to build 26 luxury residences  on the woodsy, steep-sloped property in Studio City, the center of a spirited  tug of war between the developer and environmentalists.  </P> <P> The expenditure endorsed by the members of the Recreation and Parks Commission,  all Bradley appointees, is also subject to review by the Los Angeles City  Council.  </P> <P> The next major test of the Bradley-Woo plan will come at a meeting Monday of  the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, the state agency that is the other  major partner in the deal to buy Fryman Canyon.  </P> <P> The Bradley-Woo deal envisions the conservancy contributing $8.7 million toward  the purchase price of Fryman Canyon, the city, $1.96 million and private  contributors, $240,000.  </P> <P> Although the state parks agency two months ago voted to kick in up to $8.7  million, it agreed to do so only if state appraisers valued the property at  $10.7 million -- which they have not done.  </P> <P> So far, the maximum state valuation of the property has been $8.7 million, and  conservancy chief Joseph T. Edmiston has said he has doubts about the legality  and propriety of the city and the parks agency paying anything in excess of a  government-appraised amount.  </P> <P> Despite such reservations, the conservancy is set to debate a proposal at its  next meeting to spend $8.7 million on Fryman "without further appraisal."  </P> <P> In addition to approving the $1.2 million, the City Council also must rescind a  plan to spend $719,000 on a park project in Temescal Canyon in the Pacific  Palisades, switching the funds to the Fryman purchase to complete its  contribution of $1.96 million.  </P> <P> Councilman Marvin Braude, who represents the Palisades, has agreed to this  plan, Woo said.  </P> <P> Monday's vote requires at least temporarily stripping the city's Runyon Canyon  Acquisition Trust Fund of all its money and putting on hold for an indefinite  period construction of a ranger interpretive center and amphitheater for nature  classes for children at Runyon Canyon Park in Hollywood.  </P> <P> Woo said there were "no absolute guarantees" that the trust account would be  replenished -- a point that Commissioner Richard Riordan, an attorney, said was  troubling to him.  </P> <P> The Runyon Canyon fund was set up by the city and the conservancy to make land  buys and capital improvements at the 133-acre park. The money may be used for  non-Runyon Canyon purposes with the approval of the commission, the council and  the Conservancy.  </P> <P> Riordan said he was concerned about the "policy" decision to spend scarce parks  dollars on an unimproved park in a well-to-do area of Studio City.  </P> <P> The decision may deprive inner city residents of park services, complained  Riordan, who also said he was bothered that children might be the losers if the  Runyon Canyon improvements are delayed.  </P> <P> But Woo argued that Fryman Canyon is actually centrally located enough to be  accessible to inner city parks users, and he pledged to work diligently to get  the Runyon Canyon funds replaced.  </P> <P> Commissioners Dean Pregerson and J. Stanley Sanders also made the commission's  support of the plan conditional upon the conservancy agreeing to operate the  Fryman Canyon park in accordance with city recreational policies.  </P> <P> Under the Bradley-Woo plan, the conservancy would actually own the land.  </P></p>

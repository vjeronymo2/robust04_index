			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> TOWNHOUSE OWNERS OK SETTLEMENT  </P> <P> Members of the Rondell Condominium Homeowners Assn. in Agoura Hills on Saturday  approved a $4.9-million out-of-court settlement of a lawsuit that will pay for  repairs of an eroded hillside damaged during a rainstorm more than six years  ago.  </P> <P> Property owners approved the settlement 65 to 1 at Agoura Hills City Hall, said  an association spokesman, Donald Wiechec.  </P> <P> The steep hillside in Liberty Canyon slumped to within a few feet of the two-  and three-bedroom townhouses on March 15, 1983.  </P> <P> The site since has been protected by a huge swath of plastic tarp, and the  settlement guarantees its repair even if the cost exceeds the $4.9 million.  </P> <P> The settlement, negotiated over the past 18 months, ends years of litigation  involving two homeowners' associations that sued each other, at least five  insurance companies, the developers of the condominiums and the companies that  attempted to repair the hillside after another slide in 1978, attorneys said.  </P></p>

			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Call for tighter health checks on cattle ANIMAL health experts and farmers' leaders in Britain are calling for more stringent European Community controls and greater vigilance by importers after the first outbreaks of the cattle diseases brucellosis and warble fly for three years. Brucellosis, which causes cows to abort and can lead to severe fever in humans through direct contact or unpasteurised milk, has broken out on three separate farms in Anglesey, north Wales, and Cheshire, north-west England. Animals showing antibodies to the disease - known as reactors - have been found on two other farms in Cheshire. Ministry of Agriculture vets are checking to see whether the disease, which has been absent from Britain since 1990, was brought into the country by imported French or Dutch cattle or has been lying dormant in domestic herds. The warble fly outbreaks, which have reached 107, have been traced to imported French cattle that carried certificates of health. The fly burrows under the skin along the spine, causing discomfort and death if untreated and affecting the quality of the hide. The infestations can be treated with chemicals, unlike brucellosis, where infected cattle have to be slaughtered. Warble fly is not a notifiable disease in the EC, so the Ministry of Agriculture has put the onus on UK farmers to treat newly imported animals against it. Some farmers are blaming the diseases on the advent of the single market, which ended border checks on live animals on January 1. Quarantine restrictions against foot-and-mouth disease were removed in April last year. But Mr David Naish, president of the National Farmers Union, said yesterday that it was up to livestock importers to ensure that UK cattle were kept free of imported disease. He blamed 'a small minority of irresponsible dealers'. 'It is imperative that all those involved in the livestock trade adhere strictly to the certification requirements covering the movement of animals from one country to another,' he said. The British Veterinary Association said the outbreaks of disease, particularly brucellosis, were 'very worrying'. 'With the advent of the internal market, the movement of animals has gone up 10 or 15-fold,' said Mr Francis Anthony, senior vice-president of the association. 'The more movements there are, the more risk of disease.' The threat does not stem solely from within the EC. Italy suffered an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease earlier this year, which was brought in from eastern Europe. Mr Anthony said the European Commission had to ensure all member states used common health certification standards. Under single market rules, animals for export are given health certificates by officially appointed vets on the farms where they originate. Spot checks for diseases are also carried out on imported animals once they arrive at their destination. 'Veterinarians are not trained to the same standards throughout member states,' said Mr Anthony. 'We and our fellow veterinarians in member states need to be able to trust each other's certification. There's a dirty great question mark surrounding it at the moment.' The association is advising farmers to quarantine imported animals for two weeks before introducing them into domestic herds. The European Commission has approved the slaughter of 600,000 German pigs to combat outbreaks of classical swine fever, Reuter reports.</p>

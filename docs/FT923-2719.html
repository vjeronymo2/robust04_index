			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / International Company News: Skandia to sell US specialist insurer SKANDIA, the Swedish insurance group, yesterday announced the sale of Great States Financial Corporation, a specialty workers' compensation insurer licensed in California and Arizona, to FHP International Corporation of the US. The Swedish group said the sale reflects its decision to reduce its risk exposure in the US, and follows plans to spin off part of its US reinsurance business. Skandia said the sale would provide a profit after tax of about SKr35m (Dollars 6.4m), although it said exact price details for the deal were not being made public. Great States Financial Corporation was set up by Skandia in 1989 and has annual premium income of about SKr200m, which represents a relatively small proportion of Skandia's total US operations. Total premium income from the US amounts to about SKr6bn, including reinsurance, direct insurance and international life insurance business, Skandia said. FHP International Corporation is a publicly-listed company which specialises in health care and sickness insurance. The company said the deal with Skandia would enable it to issue its own workers' compensation policies in California and Arizona, rather than arranging for another insurance company to issue such policies. Earlier this year, Skandia announced plans to concentrate on its core businesses of direct non-life insurance and life assurance for individuals and small or medium-sized companies. In July, Skandia registered an initial public offering (IPO) of 30 per cent of the shares in Skandia America, its US subsidiary which includes its reinsurance operations. Skandia said it plans to go ahead with the IPO, but added that a date has not yet been fixed.</p>

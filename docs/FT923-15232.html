			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Thatcher urges 'rethink' on treaty  -Debates in the Lords and Commons strengthened the attack on the government over Europe THE GOVERNMENT'S attempt to find a way through the difficulties over the Maastricht treaty came under fire from Baroness Thatcher yesterday, as she used her first speech in the House of Lords to urge the Community to 'think again'. 'Searching for a definition of subsidiarity is not a way forward,' she said, pointing out that it appeared to be being discussed on the basis that the Community had the power which it then parcelled out to the member states. 'It should be the member states that exercise all powers except those specifically and legally granted to the Commission,' she concluded. Her own proposal was for the government to press for a formal and binding restatement of the Luxembourg compromise - under which if a country feels that a vital national interest is at stake, a vote is postponed until agreement can be reached. She said the move, though limited, would 'go some way to restore people's confidence in the Community.' Lady Thatcher's renewed call for a referendum on Maastricht received some support from Lord Callaghan, a former Labour prime minister. He acknowledged the force of her point that because all three parties had the policy of ratifying Maastricht, the British people have had no way of expressing a view on the matter in the election. Lord Callaghan said he believed the treaty should be ratified and the government should argue the case for acceptance in a referendum after the bill had been passed. Although maiden speeches are conventionally uncontroversial, it was clear that peers had been looking forward to an occasion billed as being anything but. Crowded in the doorways and seated on the steps of the throne, they listened intently throughout the 25-minute speech, in what would normally be a routine debate on developments in Europe. A huddle of Euro-sceptic MPs looked down from the gallery, joined by Mr Graham Bright, the prime minister's parliamentary private secretary. Lady Thatcher warned that as EC ministers spent more time in each other's company they became out of touch with their electors. 'Justifiable scepticism is on the increase. People feel that their governments have gone ahead too fast, so that now the gap between governments and people is too wide,' she said. She rounded on the message that had been coming from government loyalists, that the powers transferred to the Community under the Maastricht agreement were comparable with those transferred in the Single European Act which was approved during her premiership. Any comparison was, she said, misplaced, and she drew particular attention to the assurances given by Lord Howe of Aberavon, then Sir Geoffrey Howe, and Baroness Chalker - the foreign office ministers at the time - about the restrictions on the extended use of qualified majority voting to bring about the single market. Lady Thatcher supported the government's efforts to persuade the other EC countries of the need for urgency in enlarging the Community. She underlined the primary importance of bringing in eastern European countries to help sustain their democracies and economies, even though they would need a long transition period. She also emphasised that one of the main aims of the UK's presidency of the EC must be to sustain relief supplies for Sarajevo and other parts of what was Yugoslavia, and warned: 'We should be ready to use the air power available to Nato in the area.'</p>

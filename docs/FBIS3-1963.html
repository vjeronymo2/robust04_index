			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Shanghai, March 2 (XINHUA) -- Out of the many  global counterparts of McDonnell Douglas [MD], the aircraft  manufacturing giant in the United States, the Shanghai Aircraft  Factory has now developed into its number one overseas spare  parts supplier.    At present, it has sold 261 total sets of spare parts to MD,  including both simple products like main landing-gear doors and  advanced ones like electronic cabin doors and tailplanes which  set more strict demands on technology and skills.    The Shanghai Aircraft Factory has played an important role  in  Sino-U.S. high-tech cooperations during recent years.    Apart from active competition on the world's spare parts  markets, it has also introduced advanced technology and  management experience from McDonnell Douglas to jointly  manufacture MD-82 and MD-83 aircrafts.</p>

			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / US and Russia agree to disagree Russia and the US yesterday acknowledged that the 'honeymoon' between them was over and that they were fated to have disagreements. But they also agreed to remain yoked in a partnership which, it was stressed, was one of equals. This emerged from a one-day meeting between Mr Andrei Kozyrev, Russian foreign minister, and Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, in the far eastern Russian port of Vladivostok. The meeting came after Russia had expressed anger with what it saw as Nato's failure to consult it about air strikes in Bosnia, differences over the withdrawal of Russian troops from the Baltic states, and a growing swell of opinion in the US that the attempts of the two countries to forge a close partnership is - in the words of Mr Zbigniew Brzezinski, the former US national security adviser - 'premature'. Mr Kozyrev said after the talks that Russia and the US were building a 'mature relationship' of equals which would survive differences. Mr Christopher said that 'we recognise that as large nations with large interests we are bound to have differences, but we pledge to deal with our differences openly'. According to the Rusian Information Agency, Mr Kozyrev said Russia wanted a rapid withdrawal of its troops from the Baltic states, but 'this will happen only if we agree on a civilised exit (of the troops) and as long as the deportation of the miliary pensioners is stopped'. The Baltic states, especially Estonia, have protested against Russia linking the withdrawal of the troops - set to be completed by the end of August - with other demands, a stance which has been supported by the main western countries. Mr Christopher said that Russia welcomed the implementation of the 'Partnership for Peace' accord, under which central and east European states, including Russia, could become more closely associated with Nato, short of full membership. However, in a recent article in the daily Izvestia, Mr Kozyrev had said that 'the Partnership for Peace is not to be thought of as the summit of creation' and that the Nato act in ignoring Russian interests in Bosnia showed that it remained an organisation which excluded Russia. Mr Pavel Grachev, Russia's defence minister, has postponed a trip and remained in Moscow to ensure reliable control of Russia's nuclear forces while President Boris Yeltsin is on leave, the Defence Ministry said yesterday. Mr Yeltsin earlier in the day left for an unannounced holiday by the Black Sea.</p>

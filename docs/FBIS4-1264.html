			<p>BFN     [Text] Harare April 22 SAPA -- Zimbabwe President Robert  Mugabe has not, contrary to reports, ordered a commission of  inquiry into a land-grab scandal involving senior party and  government officials, a daily newspaper in Harare reported on  Friday [22 April]. He had made his own enquiries and that was  the end of the matter, it said.    The DAILY GAZETTE was quoting Minister of Home Affairs  Dumiso  Dabengwa on an earlier remark to a human rights convention  nearly two weeks ago that Mr Mugabe had ordered an inquiry into  disclosures that state-owned farms, many of them intended for  resettling thousands of peasant farmers, had been distributed  among officials including two cabinet ministers, top officers of  the army, air force, police and intelligence services and senior  civil servants.    "The word inquiry does not automatically translate into a  commission," the GAZETTE quoted Mr Dabengwa on Friday. "The  president went on to enquire about the scheme himself and got  the reply he wanted, resulting in the action he has taken."    Last week Mr Mugabe announced he had cancelled all leases to  the estimated 180 state-owned farms, and denied there was a  scandal. Only a few political figures had benefited, he said.    The independent press here has named 15, and there are known  to be at least five more.    Observers say Mr Dabengwa's remarks are likely to deepen  dismay over the way in which the government is handling the  scandal, and that it is clear Mr Mugabe does not intend to give  it the same concern he did to the 1989 controversy when ruling  party politicians profiteered in a used-car racket. Then he  appointed a commission of inquiry headed by a judge that  resulted in five cabinet ministers resigning in disgrace for  cheating and lying, one of them taking his own life.    Land is regarded as the most explosive issue in Zimbabwean  politics, and probably the basis of Mr Mugabe's political  platform because he regularly promises to correct the inequities  of the colonial past. At independence the ruling ZANU (PF)  [Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front] party promised  165,000 families would be settled in five years. Fourteen years  later, about 100,000 have been settled and vast tracts of land  bought by government are lying idle.</p>

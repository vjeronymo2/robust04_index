			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / Arts: Today's Television Monday night is rather an over-egged pudding these days for anyone who prefers factual programmes to drama or light entertainment, and often the pudding has a strong American flavour. Today's Horizon sounds as though it will complement Channel 4's current Tuesday night series in 'Without Walls' which is looking at some of the more scary effects of recent technological advances. Horizon considers the possibility of benevolent effects from 'intelligent technology' created by the 'new alchemists' in Britain, Japan and, of course, the US (8.00 BBC2). World In Action (8.30 ITV) promises to expose 'a secret group of right wing fanatics waging a campaign of political terrorism in Britain'. Channel 4 begins a series called Naked Sport produced by Nicholas Kent who made the memorable 'Naked Hollywood' series. This series, about sport in the US begins with boxing. Channel 4 offers States Of America (11.55) the second debate, with Camille Paglia, Robert Hughes and Edward Said on political correctness with Christopher Hitchens.</p>

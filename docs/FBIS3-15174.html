This was stated by Foreign  Minister Andrey Kozyrev in an interview to RIA. At the same  time he underlined that Russia recognizes the Bosnian Serbs as  one of the conflicting sides.    The head of the Foreign Ministry paid special attention to  the conclusion of an agreement on the airport in Tuzla. Kozyrev  believes that this agreement could be assessed as the second  breakthrough in the settlement of the Bosnian crisis, after  Sarajevo. The Russian minister also added that Moscow does not  insist on the sending of a U.S. peacemaking contingent to  Bosnia.</p>

			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / International Company News: US pension fund may object to Equitable plan THE US Steel Pension Fund, a sizeable US institutional investor, is likely to raise objections to a demutualisation scheme proposed by The Equitable, the large but ailing US life insurer, when public hearings on the plan start today. The demutualisation scheme is designed to transform The Equitable from a policy holder-controlled company to one owned by shareholders, thus easing The Equitable's efforts to bolster its thin capital base. Policy holders are being asked vote on the matter next month, and two-thirds of those voting must be in favour for the scheme to go ahead. Axa, the big French insurance company, has an acute interest in the outcome; it invested Dollars 1bn in The Equitable last year, and if demutualisation goes ahead, could convert this into as much as 49 per cent of The Equitable's shares. The US steel pension fund is a major policyholder with the Equitable, and confirmed yesterday a representative planned to be at the hearings, being held by the New York State Insurance Department later today. The fund stressed it supports the principle of demutualisation, but 'questions the fairness of the way in which they are going about it'. It declined to comment further. The Equitable said yesterday that 95,000 - out of the 2.2m policyholders who were sent details of the plan - had rung its 'hotline' by Friday evening, with queries about the demutualisation scheme. The bulk of the queries, it said, came shortly after the copious documents were sent out.</p>

			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Recession blamed for Pounds 0.75m loss at Bucknall BUCKNALL GROUP, the quantity surveyor and project manager, felt the full force of recession in the construction industry during its first half and, as it had warned, tipped into loss. However, the group was now trading profitably, Mr David Bucknall, chairman, said yesterday. Pre-tax losses for the half year to October 31 amounted to Pounds 752,000, against profits of Pounds 542,000 last time, on turnover down to Pounds 8.59m (Pounds 10.4m). This translated into losses of 5.6p per share against earnings of 4.4p. No interim dividend is declared (1.3p). Although Mr Bucknall expected little improvement in UK trading conditions this calendar year - 'the downward slope of demand is flattening out a bit, it's approaching the bottom' - the group has sought to stem losses by trimming costs and becoming more active in overseas markets .By the end of the current financial year nearly 25 per cent of turnover will come from outside the UK, double the 1990-91 proportion. But gearing remains higher than expected at 68 per cent, against 129 per cent in April 1991. It is likely to stay at about the present level in the face of sustained pressure on UK margins.</p>

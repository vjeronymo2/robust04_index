			<p><P> October 20, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: BEVERLY HILLS  </P> <P> Morton Dimondstein paints the unbeautiful people -- ordinary folks in their  comfortable clothes. Piecing together several sheets of paper to make an ample  surface, he lets his easygoing brush focus on pattern, vivid color and a basic  sense of human character. "Regina," in stinging green beads and a pink mini,  smirks as she poses next to a battery of studio lights. "Joshua," an intense  fellow in a striped shirt and tennis shoes, turns his back on a brightly  dressed woman who chats with a plump nude. For some reason, the nudes in these  paintings -- who seem to be studio models -- are only ciphers, bulky figures  with no discernable personality.  </P> <P> The most that can be said for Dimondstein's painting style is that it does the  job in a workmanlike and self-effacing way. His strength lies in the warmly  human but unprettifying eye -- verging slightly on caricature -- with which he  views most of his subjects. "Chris and Dorothy" in particular -- two lumpy  middle-aged people in drab dress -- radiate a simple content with their lot in  life. Dimondstein's abstract "Torso" sculptures share that unpretentious  quality. The hollows and planes have an honest, handcrafted look, complete with  cracks and blemishes, and the grain of the wood is carefully used to full  effect. (Ana Izax Gallerie, 421 N. Rodeo Drive, to Nov. 4.) CATHY CURTIS  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Danielle Yang] </F>   [Text] Taipei, June 28 (CNA) -- Taiwan's trade deficit with  Japan will be difficult to correct if current trade trends  continue, a Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT) official said Tuesday  [28 Jun].    Taiwan's trade deficit with Japan topped U.S.$14.2 billion  in  1993, mainly because of a 45 percent import growth from Japan in  the past three years and a poor performance by made-in-Taiwan  products on the Japanese market, the official said.    Taiwan's major export to Japan, electric machinery, saw a  2.7  percent decline in its market share over the past three years.  Other Taiwan goods, including wood products, knitwear, steel,  toys, sporting goods, furniture and plastic products have also  lost market share to imports from Mainland China and Southeast  Asian nations, he said.    Despite the appreciation of the Japanese yen, which  benefited  Taiwan exporters, the loss of competitiveness of Taiwan products  makes the increasing trade deficit hard to control, the official  said.    Japan imported U.S.$9.7 billion worth of products from  Taiwan  in 1993, accounting for 4 percent of total imports of U.S.$240.7  billion, he added.</p>

			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Observer: Taking the Miki It is hard to remember a former British prime minister who has worked so hard at making serious money as Lady Thatcher. It is reckoned that she can command Pounds 30,000 for a speech in the US, and when her globe-trotting takes her further afield the fees are rumoured to be higher still. However, Observer was rather surprised to learn of her latest plans to save the world in a two-page advert in Japan's Nihon Keizai Shimbun. In a special interview with Toshikazu Kadota, president of Miki, a relatively unknown firm which is diversifying into the field of women's wear, Lady Thatcher gives her thoughts on everything from personal happiness - 'having a wonderful family life and a job you love' - to saving the environment. Like many former leaders, Lady Thatcher is held in much higher esteem abroad than at home and her address to the Miki International Ladies' Forum only seems strange to a British audience. Even so, even Lady T might wince at knowing that her thoughts on saving the planet have been repackaged into a double-page spread promoting Miki prune extract. . .  .</p>

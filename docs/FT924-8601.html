			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / International Company News: Omron turns in 80% tumble OMRON, a leading Japanese electronic systems manufacturer, yesterday blamed a virtual freeze on investment by Japanese companies for an 80 per cent drop in pre-tax profits for the first half of its financial year. Omron said the sharp downturn in the Japanese economy over the past six months had created a drastic situation, with industrial investment grinding to a halt after the boom of the late 1980s. Omron, which makes factory, traffic and office computer control systems, reported an 80.2 per cent drop in net profits to Y1.28bn (Dollars 10.4m) in the six months to September from Y6.47bn in the same period a year earlier. Turnover fell by 10.8 per cent to Y169.7bn from Y190.4bn. Omron is suffering from the same pressures that are hitting many Japanese manufacturers. Its heavy investment programme in the late 1980s has left it carrying high depreciation costs as economic growth is slowing.</p>

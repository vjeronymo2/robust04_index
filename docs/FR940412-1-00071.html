			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 9. Two comments suggested that the provision of Special Permit 1&hyph;92 excepting shipments of DRI lumps, pellets, and cold-molded briquets on short and sheltered voyages from the requirement that such cargoes must be inerted or inhibited should be extended to voyages made entirely on the inland waters of the U.S. This comment is adopted and is included in proposed &sect;148.245(h)(2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. One comment recommended that precautions for entering inerted holds be added to the requirements for carrying DRI lumps, pellets and cold-molded briquets. The comment noted that when carbon dioxide is the inerting medium, a safety risk could possibly be created by carbon monoxide produced by reaction between the carbon dioxide and the DRI. The recommendation is adopted and appropriate requirements for analyzing the atmosphere of the cargo hold for carbon monoxide and oxygen prior to entry are included in proposed &sect;148.245(g). Also, that section is referenced in proposed Table 148.10.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11. Four comments recommended that the Coast Guard refrain from publishing any proposed requirements for the carriage of coal prior to receiving the final report of the Chemical Transportation Advisory Committee (CTAC) Subcommittee on Coal Transportation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CTAC formed the Coal Subcommittee in order to obtain the recommendations of the U.S. coal industry, and the Coast Guard did not intend to publish any requirements for the carriage of coal prior to receiving the Subcommittee's report. Since this comment was received, the final report of the Coal Subcommittee was submitted to and approved by CTAC. Subsequently, the Coast Guard prepared and submitted a proposal based on the Coal Subcommittee's final report to the 31st session of the IMO Subcommittee on Containers and Cargoes (The ``BC Subcommittee''). The U.S. proposal, with some slight modifications, was adopted by the BC Subcommittee; and in 1991, the provisions of the BC Code dealing with the transport of coal were amended accordingly. Proposed &sect;148.240 is based on the BC Code as amended.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;148.240 differs from the report of the CTAC Coal Subcommittee in the following respects:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. The report offers no guidance on the frequency of monitoring for methane and carbon monoxide, while paragraphs (i) and (l) of proposed &sect;148.240 set out minimum testing frequency for that coal which is most likely to create dangerous conditions. Under proposed &sect;148.240(n), it would be within the discretion of the master to reduce the frequency of monitoring in certain situations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. The report does not specify that the temperature of a self-heating coal must be monitored. Paragraph (j) of proposed &sect;148.240 would require such monitoring.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. The report directs the master to seek expert advice and to consider heading for the nearest suitable port of refuge if it is determined that the coal is heating. Proposed &sect;148.240(k) would require the master to contact the nearest Coast Guard Captain of the Port when a coal cargo is heating.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other comments about coal concern the effects of designating coal as a hazardous material and question the necessity of regulating barge shipments of coal. These issues are addressed in the discussion on the designation of certain materials as potentially dangerous, and in the discussion of the treatment of barge shipments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12. Two comments recommended that, based on experience gained while shipping uncalcined petroleum coke under the terms of a Coast Guard Special Permit, uncalcined petroleum coke be treated in the same manner as calcined petroleum coke in the proposed regulations. This recommendation is adopted and is included in &sect;148.295. In addition, the Coast Guard submitted a paper to the 30th session of the IMO Subcommittee on Containers and Cargoes recommending that a similar change be made to the BC Code. This proposal met with approval and the BC Code was amended accordingly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 13. One comment requested that a public hearing be held in the event that woodchips and wood pulp pellets were not removed from this rulemaking. The Coast Guard declined to schedule a public hearing at this stage of the rulemaking. The only requirement for shipments of woodchips and wood pulp pellets included in this proposed rule is that closed holds be tested prior to entry to ensure that they contain sufficient oxygen to support life. Because most U.S. shipments of woodchips and wood pulp pellets are currently made in open barges, this requirement would not apply to most U.S. shipments. The requirement is retained in this proposal in order to comply with the revisions to Chapter VI of SOLAS 74/83. Because the requirement would not apply to most U.S. shipments of woodchips and wood pulp pellets, the Coast Guard has determined that a public hearing is not necessary at this time. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indian jute mill workers settle in for long strike INDIAN JUTE mill workers appear to be settling in for a long strike in support of demands for a pay rise. Neither the trade unions nor the Indian Jute Mills Association believe that the dispute - now affecting 54 mills in West Bengal, where the industry is largely concentrated - will be settled quickly. And the Marxist government of West Bengal seems to be in no hurry to bring about a settlement. In the past two decades the highly unionised jute workers have gone on indefinite strike on six occasions. The 1984 stoppage, the longest in the industry's history, lasted nearly three months. This time the mill owners, who claim the wages they pay compare favourably with those in other industries, are determined to resist the workers' demands, insisting that pay rises must be linked to improved productivity. Some mill owners suspect that the state government will use the present strike to register its protest against the federal government's appeal to avoid any kind of industrial action for at least two years. According to Mr Bharat Jalan, chairman of the Jute Mills Association, the strike will affect India's export of jute goods badly, particularly to the hard currency areas. Whenever there has been a long strike in the past, either in jute mills or at Calcutta port, which handles jute cargoes, India has been forced to concede a portion of its share of the world jute goods market, mainly to Bangladesh but also partly to Thailand and China. Mr RN De, the jute commissioner, agrees with the IJMA chief that the dispute will be sending out disturbing signals to overseas buyers who, after watching the situation for a while longer, are likely to cancel orders placed earlier with Indian mills and merchant shippers and cover their position elsewhere. Bangladesh, however, will not be in a position to reap full benefit from India's predicament as it has shut down some unprofitable mills, according to Mr De. In keeping with India's new trade policy, he said, the industry had gone all-out to increase exports of jute goods to hard currency areas and reduce dependence on rupee trade countries during 1991-92. In the eight months to November 1992 the country's jute goods export to hard currency countries increased to 94,000 tonnes, worth Rs1.44bn (Pounds 31m) from 65,000 tonnes, valued at Rs830m in the corresponding period of the previous year. Exports to the rupee payment countries, on the other hand, declined from 77,300 tonnes valued at Rs1.03bn, to 49,200 tonnes, worth Rs790m. As the indications are for a long drawn-out strike, there appears no way India can achieve the export target of 250,000 tonnes during 1991-92. Following sustained market development efforts and devaluation of its currency, India seemed set to win many new buyers for its high value hessian, carpet-backing cloth, yarn and speciality items in the UK, Germany, France, Italy, The Netherlands and Japan. But, according to the merchant shippers, the country is now likely to lose the new customers. Exporting has not come to a stop, however. The five jute mills owned by the federal government and a mill run by the workers' co-operative have been able to keep on producing and despatching jute goods as the trade unions have exempted them from the strike. Domestic sales of jute goods will also shrink as a result of the strike. The synthetic bag industry is well developed in the country and it is going to take full advantage of the suspension of production in jute mills. As long as the jute mills were in operation, the synthetic bag producers could not utilise their full capacity because jute was enjoying protection. They are certain to ask for the removal of that protection, at least while the strike lasts. And the government, which is in the process of liberalising the economy, will find it difficult to turn down the synthetic bag industry's demand. The strike will also have an impact on the next jute crop. In Assam, North Bengal and Bihar, the preparation of land for jute cultivation will begin by the end of this month and in South Bengal in the middle of March. Even though the growers have by now disposed of 90 per cent of the 1991-92 crop, they are likely to switch some land from jute to paddy and oilseeds in view of the reaction in fibre prices, according to Mr Shankar Ladia, spokesman for jute trade. Raw jute prices started falling when the strike began late last month. The switch could remove between 10 per cent and 20 per cent of land now under jute. For two consecutive years India has harvested bumper jute crops in excess of 9m bales (180 kg each). But the mill strike has raised serious doubts about the prospects for the 1992-93 crop.</p>

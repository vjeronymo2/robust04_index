			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Historic echoes for Sinn Fein A small piece of history will be made in Dublin today when Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, meets the republic's mainstream political parties for the first time as the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation gets under way. The 35-member forum, which will sit once a week, will include Northern Ireland's moderate nationalist Social Democratic Labour party and the province's small, non-sectarian Alliance party. But with no formal representation from Ulster's majority unionists, the forum has already been dismissed as a pan-nationalist front. Certainly, if there is to be a reconciliation it will be between the fractured parties of Irish republicanism, rather than Ireland's two religious traditions. For the return of Sinn Fein to the political fold is itself a momentous event. All Ireland's constitutional parties apart from Labour trace their origins to Sinn Fein, which led the war of independence against British colonial rule. Officials are quick to point out the parallels with the 1983-84 New Ireland Forum, where the task had less to do with reassuring unionists than bolstering the constitutional nationalists of Mr John Hume's SDLP which, in the wake of the hunger strikes, was losing electoral ground to Sinn Fein. Today Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, is the central mover behind the project. He sees a real urgency to rehabilitate the hardliners of Sinn Fein and a danger that the peace process could unravel if this is not achieved. The forum is seen as a period of political quarantine for Sinn Fein in the countdown to full political talks with London and the all-party discussions on the future of the province. The going will not be easy. Sinn Fein will no doubt try to take the high ground as the only all-Ireland political party, contesting elections north and south of the border - a border which it does not recognise. Its language of liberation may encourage the armed volunteers in the field, but is not likely to go down well in the more cynical confines of Leinster House, the Irish parliament. In one important respect Sinn Fein is on its own. It is the only party represented not to have endorsed the Downing Street declaration, or what the Irish prefer to call the Joint Declaration, the 12-point accord which set the peace process in train last December. Pointedly, the forum's terms of reference spell out that it is set up in accordance with the joint declaration.</p>

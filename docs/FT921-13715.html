			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / A classic Mitterrand strip-tease Ten days ago, President Francois Mitterrand of France suggested that the 12 European Community countries should develop a joint doctrine on nuclear weapons. He did not say why they needed a joint nuclear doctrine, and he declined to say what it should consist of. But he declared that this would 'very quickly' become a significant issue in the building of a European defence. This kind of talk, which is both provocative and evasive, challenging but enigmatic, is a classic Mitterrand strip-tease. The president is manifestly suggesting the opening-up of the long-guarded treasure of French national independence in nuclear policy. Yet he makes the suggestion so obliquely and moves on so quickly, that the casual observer is not sure whether the diaphanous veil fluttered aside for a moment or two, nor, if it did, whether what was revealed was worth seeing. On the face of it, the suggestion is a reckless provocation at the heart of the French body politic. More than 25 years ago, France walked out of the integrated structure of Nato, and for an even longer period it has proclaimed that its nuclear arsenal is independent from those of its allies. This insistence on independence may have played a key role in maintaining popular support for France's nuclear role; it has been a constant feature of the stock-in-trade of all mainline politicians for a generation. Deliberately to suggest the development of a European nuclear doctrine, therefore, would seem foolhardy and premature. Mr Mitterrand's immediate need is popular support and formal ratification for the Maastricht treaties on economic and political union. These treaties already call for far-reaching shifts of national sovereignty between France and the emerging federal structures in Europe. They do not explicitly require any early change in French nuclear doctrine; so it seems gratuitous to give the national nuclear consensus an extra shake before it is absolutely necessary. That, at least, was what I thought when I read his speech; it appears I was wrong. Since he spoke, there has been almost no reaction from the political establishment in France. One choleric protest came from Mr Jacques Baumel, an unreconstructed Gaullist politician of the old school; but it turned out that he had misunderstood what President Mitterrand had said. By contrast, Mr Bernard Bosson of the pro-European centrist CDS party, had not misunderstood and warmly approved. For the rest, President Mitterrand's tease did not stir up France's leading politicians at all - not even the top brass of the Gaullist party. Of course, the Cold War is over, and nuclear deterrence no longer makes the headlines as it once did; so perhaps the French are less sensitive to the question of nuclear independence. Whatever the reason, it looks as though France's national nuclear deterrent may be on its way to being de-sanctified. This is all to the good. There has long been a deep contradiction at the heart of France's European policy, between the active pursuit of integration in political and economic affairs, and the doctrinaire refusal of integration in defence. The contradiction has become even more stark during the past year, after France (with Germany) openly started pressing the case for a European defence policy, without abandoning the traditional Gaullist rhetoric at home in relation to French national defence. These Gaullist hang-ups are now being discarded in a fairly systematic way. In November, Nato endorsed the development of a European defence role, through the creation of 'integrated and multinational European structures'. It was a historic compromise: the US has stopped asking the French to rejoin Nato, and the French have stopped objecting to military integration. That removed the last obstacle to an agreement at Maastricht on the objective of a European defence. The unresolved question was where French nuclear weapons fitted in with Europe's defence. It is easy to argue, like Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, that French (and UK) nuclear weapons should be handed over to a strong European federal authority; but such an authority will not exist for decades. President Mitterrand's proposal, for the development of a European nuclear doctrine, is bolder, because it could start to happen more quickly. So what does he have in mind? Officials smile and shrug. If Mr Mitterrand has something precise in mind, he must be keeping it to himself. They say his main objective is political, not technical: the central fact is that he has, for the first time, placed the question of French nuclear weapons on the European table. 'The nuclear question is posed,' says one. 'We need to ask what is the future of nuclear deterrence in Europe, after the dissolution of the Soviet enemy? There is no longer a French taboo. This reinforces the credibility of our approach to European defence; we shall be seeking the reactions of the British and the Germans.' It will take more than a few oblique phrases to wipe out 30 years of Gaullism, however. A senior German diplomat was sceptical: 'This is new; but I'm not sure it means a lot. It is hardly likely that Mitterrand will offer to discuss nuclear targeting.' A senior UK diplomat was even more dismissive and smug: 'Mitterrand is simply signalling that he is aware of the contradictions in the French position; we do not know if there is anything more behind it. The French have a problem; we do not.' My hunch is that Mr Mitterrand wants to start serious political discussions. The Germans and British therefore need to decide what they think and what they want. Scepticism will not be enough.</p>

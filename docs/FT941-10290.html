			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / People: More upsets in venture capital Gilbert Chalk, the founder and managing director of Hambro European Ventures, has resigned after a disagreement with the parent company, Hambros. His resignation is the latest in a line of departures from UK venture capital companies. Jon Moulton left his position as managing partner of Schroder Ventures last week and Robert Drummond resigned as chairman of Grosvenor Venture Managers before Christmas. Hambro European ventures, which already manages Pounds 30m, has been trying to raise a new fund in what is a particularly difficult market. It is understood that Chalk and Hambros fell out over the degree of control that the merchant bank was exercising over investments the venture capital company was making. Edmund Truell, already on the board, has taken over as managing director of Hambro European Ventures, and Michael Sorkin, a vice-chairman of Hambros Bank, has been appointed chairman.</p>

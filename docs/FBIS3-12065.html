State governors agreed with this opinion.    The state leaders attended a PRI national dinner to voice  their full support for the candidacy of Zedillo Ponce de Leon.  They said he was unanimously nominated and that their goal will  be victory on 21 August as was the goal under the leadership of  Luis Donaldo Colosio.    Jalisco State Governor Carlos Rivera Acedes described the  decision by the national PRI leadership to nominate Ernesto  Zedillo Ponce de Leon as important.    [Begin recording] [Rivera] I think it was important for the  National Executive Committee to make this decision. As our  candidate Ernesto Zedillo, we too must continue Colosio's  campaign and carry on with Colosio's platform. I am sure all  PRI members will unite around our party and our candidate  Zedillo, and will work intensely to ensure that Colosio's  platform is carried on.    [Unidentified reporter] Is there merit to [words indistinct]  6 May speech to separate the PRI from the government?    [Rivera] Yes, I think that this is definitely one of the  principles that should be reinforced.    [Reporter] Is Zedillo the most capable?    [Rivera] At this time, he is not only the most capable but a  person who was close to Colosio. He knew well the principles  that candidate Colosio was promoting. [end recording]    Guerrero State Governor Ruben Figueroa said Zedillo is a  guarantee for victory. He added that Zedillo is as strong and  vigorous a horse as Luis Donaldo Colosio Murrieta was.  Meanwhile, Maximiliano Silerio Esparza [not further identified]  assured that the figure of Luis Donaldo Colosio will help the  new campaign for the Presidency. Esparza added that he knew  Colosio well, worked very closely with him, and that he has all  the respect in the world for the person who was once his party's  presidential candidate. He said there will be a very profound  campaign and added that he is sure that Colosio will continue  helping PRI in this new phase of the presidential campaign.    Meanwhile, Puebla State Governor Manuel Bartlett Diaz said a  consultation process took place before Zedillo was nominated. He  pointed out that Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon was nominated by  generalized consensus. Veracruz State Governor Patricio Chirinos  reaffirmed what Bartlett said. He pointed out that Zedillo is a  unity candidate. Quintana Roo Governor Mario Villanueva, Morelos  Governor Antonio Riva Palacios, Campeche Governor (Jorge Salomon  Asad), Tamaulipas Governor Manuel Cabazos, Oaxaca Governor  (Diegoro Carrasco), Sonora Governor [name indistinct], and  Tlaxcala Governor Antonio Alvarez Lima, among others, made  similar statements. The governors were pleased. They agreed that  Zedillo's nomination is a logical decision for the campaign  strategy.    Mario Moya Palencia, former government secretary and current  coordinator of the PRI Ideology Commission, pointed out that  within the PRI there are no groups disputing power. Proof of  this, he added, is that the PRI was able to nominate a  replacement, Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, six days after the  death of Luis Donaldo Colosio. Moya Palencia described Zedillo  as a politician with technical abilities; a man of humble  origins who will win the trust of Mexico and the international  community. He said that the presidential candidacy of Zedillo  will face some risks but they can be overcome.    [Begin Moya recording] Presidential candidates run risks. A  crazy person could now say let us avenge Colosio by killing  another candidate. That is the danger of a violent atmosphere.  I think that all of us, especially those involved with the  media, must contribute to preventing the emergence of an  atmosphere of distrust, violence, and support for armed  solutions. [end recording]    Mario Moya Palencia also admitted that there will no longer  be easy campaigns in Mexico. He pointed out, however, that the  historical, sentimental, political, and leadership legacy of  Luis Donaldo Colosio, will join Zedillo's campaign.    Meanwhile, the PRI labor and peasant sectors pointed out  that  they have adapted to their party's decision and have voiced with  discipline their full support for the presidential candidacy of  Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon. CTM [Confederation of Mexican  Workers] President Fidel Velasquez and National Peasant  Confederation leader Hugo Andres Araujo agreed that the  candidate who replaces Colosio guarantees PRI unity and that PRI  will triumph on 21 August.    Araujo added that Zedillo is a courageous and energetic PRI  member who has a great willingness to continue the ideological  project of Luis Donaldo Colosio. Velasquez agreed with Araujo.  He said that for the organized labor movement Zedillo represents  continuity of Colosio's ideas. The CTM leader added that, like  Colosio, Zedillo will be the candidate of the country's working  class.    These were some of the reactions given at the PRI National  Headquarters after the PRI national leadership nominated Ernesto  Zedillo as their presidential candidate.</p>

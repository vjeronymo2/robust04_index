			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Cluff shares up 25% on Ghana mine finance deal Shares in Cluff Resources rose 25 per cent to 50 1/2 p yesterday after the London-based company announced that it had arranged finance for a gold mine to produce between 20,000 and 30,000 troy ounces a year in Ghana. Mr Algy Cluff, chairman, said the project, when in full production at the end of this year, would boost the company's annual gold output to 125,000 ounces, and take it into another emerging market in Africa. Current production amounts to between 60,000 and 75,000 ounces from its Zimbabwe mine. Cluff estimates it will cost Dollars 6.8m (Pounds 4.53m) for the open pit mine and heap leach operation at Ayanfuri, west of Dunkwa in central Ghana. Cluff will own 75 per cent of the operating company and the Ghana government 10 per cent. A 17,300-ounce gold loan has been arranged in London by Barclays Precious Metals, bearing interest of about 5.5 per cent and repayable over three years. To minimise its exposure to the gold price, Cluff has put a three-year hedging programme in place, involving 61,000 ounces of gold with an initial floor price of Dollars 390 an ounce. Cluff says its total costs at Ayanfuri are forecast to be Dollars 264 an ounce. Proven reserves at Ayanfuri are 286,500 ounces, giving a mine life of 10 years, while the underlying sulphide ores have indicated resources of 288,300 ounces.</p>

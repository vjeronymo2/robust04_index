			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / International Company News: Wella takes stake in US hair-care company WELLA, the German personal products specialist, has taken a controlling stake in Sebastian International, a Los Angeles hair-care company, which will double its share of the US salon products market to around 8 per cent. Sebastian, a leading 'designer' brand with a 'trend-setting' environmental accent, according to Wella, has annual sales of more than Dollars 80m, of which 18 per cent comes from exports. The company said it expected turnover in the US from existing activities this year to reach DM90m (Dollars 55m), compared with total group sales last year of DM2.75bn. Neither the size of the holding nor the price paid to the family owners was disclosed. The purchase is Wella's second modest but strategically important acquisition this year. In June it paid DM138m for SmithKline Beecham's Silvikrin, Bristows and Vosene hair-care brands to bolster its position in the UK and Middle East. The UK and Ireland together account for around 70 per cent of the three brands' annual sales of DM110m. Wella's pre-tax profits for the first half of the current year rose by 3 per cent to DM66m on turnover up 1.4 per cent to DM1.33bn. In its first-half report last month the group said it expected sales for the year, including contributions from the SmithKline brands, to rise by between 4 per cent and 6 per cent.</p>

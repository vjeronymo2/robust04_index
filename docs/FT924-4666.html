			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / International Company News: Confederation Life to raise CDollars 100m with 10-year issue CONFEDERATION Life, Canada's third-largest life insurance company with CDollars 26bn (USDollars 20.25bn) of assets under administration, plans to raise CDollars 100m with a 10-year public subordinated debenture issue. A new federal Insurance Companies Act enables mutually-owned companies to use the public markets to raise regulatory capital. Previously, insurance companies that were owned by their policyholders had to use special subsidiaries in order to raise new outside capital. Confederation Life has a relatively high exposure to property investment. In 1991 it provided CDollars 155m for mortgage and other losses. The new issue is rated double-A in Canada and single A-plus by Standard &amp; Poor's, the New York-based credit ratings agency.</p>

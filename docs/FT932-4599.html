			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Survey of Aerospace (25): Future products are a puzzle - Italy IT HAS BEEN an annus horribilis for Italy's aerospace industry. Demand for military and civil aircraft has plunged, there have been allegations of corruption over helicopters, and the need for restructuring to bring capacity in line with demand has become ever more apparent, writes Haig Simonian. The impact has been shared equally between Alenia, the leading aerospace group, Agusta in helicopters, and smaller makers such as Piaggio and Aermacchi, in both of which Alenia has significant minority stakes. Moreover, there has been a corporate upheaval among the two main manufacturers. Alenia, formerly a listed subsidiary of the state-controlled Finmeccanica engineering group, itself controlled by the Iri state holding company. has now been incorporated as an internal division, as part of a plan to increase the share float of Finmeccanica. Meanwhile, the fates of Agusta and the Oto Melara missiles group have been called into question after last July's government decision to place the loss-making Efim state holding company in voluntary liquidation. Various Efim aerospace and defence assets have been 'rented' to Finmeccanica at a token price pending a longer-term solution, which probably involves their incorporation into Alenia. On the defence side, Italy's 30 per cent cut in real terms in military spending has disrupted production targets, resulting in a halving of output of Alenia's MX tactical support aircraft, produced jointly with Brazil, to two a month from four as planned. From a forecast of 350 aircraft, production now looks unlikely to exceed 200, of which 136 have so far been ordered by Italy and 59 by Brazil. That gives Alenia enough work until 1995, after which matters become much less clear. Originally, the termination of the MX programme was to have dovetailed with the start of production of the multilateral European Fighter Aircraft programme. But, as Mr Fausto Cereti, Alenia's joint president explains: 'This programme has so many enemies that it's going forward much more slowly than expected.' Alenia's problems on the military side are common to other European producers. Rising government budget deficits and continuing uncertainty over future defence needs have led to sharp sending cuts. 'It has become much more difficult to understand what will be the products of the future,' says Mr Enrico Gimelli, Alenia's other president. Matters are no happier on the civil side. Production of the ATR regional turbo-prop, made jointly with France's Aerospatiale, has not reached expected targets because of the downturn in demand. 'We had hoped to reach an output of 65-70 planes a year by 1994,' says Mr Gimelli. 'Instead, it's running at about 50 a year.' Alenia executives deny the ATR programme, which has received 540 orders and options, is still losing money. Production is now around break-even, says Mr Gimelli, who blames continuing difficulties on price-cutting from competitors with big backlogs of unsold planes. However, he admits the drop in demand has held up plans to develop the ATR further. The group, which is a big sub-contractor for both McDonnell Douglas and Boeing, has also been hurt by the plunge in the US market. Mr Gimelli is cautious about signs of a possible upturn after recent airline orders. 'It's too soon to say there's a recovery in the US, as carriers there are very sensitive to seasonal developments. We'll have to wait until the summer season.' But he is pessimistic about the outlook in Europe. 'I think the real crisis is just beginning.' European carriers may have been more cautious in ordering new aircraft than some US counterparts, and the market may still be in slightly better shape as deregulation-driven competition has not gone so far. But the impact of falling demand remains acute. Even Alenia's successful electronics side has had its share of difficulties lately. Although orders have been maintained and the business is doing well, the company was dragged into an undesirable spat earlier this year after winning a Mexican air traffic control order jointly with Thomson of France. The award of the deal led to accusations of unfair play by the two companies which led the international ATC field. The case is still rumbling, but Alenia takes comfort from the fact that IBM, one of the losing parties, distanced itself from the charges levelled by a local partner. 'It often happens that competitors claim the two market leaders are too strong,' says Mr Cereti. While denying the Mexican spat has hurt its image, Alenia says this year's two-month strike over job losses at its Naples plant has proved costly, financially and in terms of prestige. The dispute, resolved after a compromise on relocating 2,000 of the 5,000 workers first scheduled for redundancy, led to nail-biting moments as the group saw supply deadlines to US manufacturers looming. Alenia widely publicised the pressure levelled by big US clients to persuade employees to return to work. But the company denies the US threats of taking future business elsewhere was just a bluff. In the worst case, crucial parts for one US manufacturer were delivered just a day before the contract deadline, recalls Mr Cereti. 'We became Japanese-style just-in-time suppliers without really wanting to,' he admits. 'Obviously, clients were getting worried. We were lucky in that the market was in recession, so production lines never had to be halted because of us. But these things leave lingering doubts, and our clients are bound to wonder what might have happened had the strike taken place when the market was in an upturn,' he says. 'Customers may have some sympathy for our efforts to slim down the company. But now we'll have to work hard to show Naples is a credible plant.'</p>

			<p><P> August 13, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LYON'S DEALING WITH HUD ON RANCH PROJECT  </P> <P> Maj. Gen. William Lyon is a man of immense integrity. His business savvy and  ability to negotiate are second to none. He certainly does not need to seek  unfair advantage in his business dealings.  </P> <P> As one who has worked with him on community and political projects, I can  assure you he is unwilling to bend his own standards for short-term gain. He  does not compromise his integrity to win. Your articles failed to emphasize the  premium value of the William Lyon Co.'s all-cash offer over a leveraged deal.  </P> <P> Finally, it is critical that the people of Orange County know the huge  contribution that Gen. and Mrs. Lyon have made not only to the political  process and our national security but to opportunities for children, to the  arts, to health, to education, to law enforcement and to a myriad of other  activities that make our county so great. It could be said that Bill Lyon has  positively impacted and made a difference in the life of each and every Orange  Countian.  </P> <P> When this current matter is cleared up, I hope you will put that story on the  front page.  </P> <P> NATHAN OWEN ROSENBERG  </P> <P> Corona del Mar  </P></p>

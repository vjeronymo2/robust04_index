			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / International Company News: Taiwanese PC maker nearly doubles profits Acer, Taiwan's largest personal computer maker, said parent net profits nearly doubled to an estimated TDollars 1.08bn (USDollars 41m) last year from TDollars 56m in 1992, Reuter reports from Taipei. Parent company sales climbed to an estimated TDollars 19.36bn from TDollars 12.24bn Acer said in a statement. Sales for the entire Acer group rose 67 per cent to TDollars 50bn last year and group net profits reached a record TDollars 2bn. the company said without giving group profits for 1992. Mr Philip Peng, Acer's vice-president, attributed the surge in parent sales and profits to the introduction of a system under which key computer parts are exported to overseas factories where final assembly of computers is carried out. Profits were also boosted as Acer's joint venture making dynamic random access memory (DRAM) chips with Texas Instruments started to make money, Mr Peng said. Acer's operations in the US and Europe suffered a loss of about TDollars 800m last year but broke even in the fourth quarter. The parent company obtained TDollars 500m in earnings from land disposals in 1993, compared with TDollars 580m in 1992. Peng said Acer had set sales targets of TDollars 20bn for the parent company and TDollars 62.5bn for the group this year.</p>

			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets: Mixed views on equity prospects after risky 1992 - A look at global equity performance in 1992, and strategists' views of the current year During 1992, most major economies were expected to recover, with good prospects of growth accelerating into 1993; instead there was a delayed recovery in the US, and most European economies ended 1992 either in recession or on the edge of it. Horror stories included a possible meltdown of the financial system in Japan, assorted Nordic financial disasters and the fall in the financial rand which, for dollar investors, seriously exacerbated the domestic decline in South African equities. Japan dropped by 22.7 per cent in local currency terms last year, the single most serious influence on the 3.7 per cent drop in the FT-Actuaries World Index. The US managed a 4.8 per cent gain and Europe was confused by the devaluation effect - which, for example, allowed the UK to look good with a 14.9 per cent gain in local currency terms, or pretty sick with a 7 per cent loss in terms of the dollar. James Capel's global strategy duo, Mr Alastair Ross Goobey and Mr Martin Paling, note that the Mexican peso has been stronger than the pound sterling and the Swiss franc for each of the last two years. The dollar, they add, has now risen against the D-Mark for two successive years, from DM1.50 to DM1.52 in 1991 and to DM1.621 by the end of 1992. 'As a result,' they note, 'results in common currency have continued to favour the dollar based markets.' In general, however, it was a year to be in bonds rather than equities. End-1992 figures from Kemper Investment Management show total bond market returns in local currency terms of 15 per cent plus in the hard currency markets of the Netherlands, Austria and Belgium, and either side of 13 per cent in Germany and Japan. Switzerland apart, hard currency countries got little reward in their equity markets for financial probity in 1992. According to Datastream, the Netherlands, Austria and Belgium, again, produced an average total return in local currency terms of less than 2 per cent. Strategists' opinions vary this year. Kleinwort Benson went along with the economic arguments at the end of 1991 but, to give it credit, overweighted the UK and US and underweighted Japan and Continental Europe. Mr Roger Palmer, global strategist at Kleinwort, says that the bank's biggest mistake was to raise its weighting in Europe during the course of the year. Just before Christmas, Kleinwort came out with projections for 1993. It said that equity returns should exceed those from bonds in 1993; that it expected France to show the best returns of all major equity markets in 1993; that all of continental Europe carries high risk; and that the UK stock market has the most attractive risk/reward profile. Mr Palmer thinks that the global equity risk is less than it was a year ago, with the US and the UK on the recovery path. What does worry him is the unanimity of the regard for French equity assets. A few weeks ago it asked 200 UK fund managers how many of them were not overweight in France; the answer was under 5 per cent. 'Where's the money going to come from to drive the market up?' he asks. Morgan Stanley's chief investment strategist, Mr David Roche, would like a wider range of options. 'There is no doubt', he said in mid-December, 'that if Mars were a well run, investable place I'd be overweight there. There are few bargains around on Earth.' Mr Roche thought that 1993 could well be a year 'when under-owned, second-tier stocks (particularly financials) perform better than some that are gold-plated, and over-owned.' He also saw possibilities in some 'inferior' quality economies and financial assets. The bank likes, inter alia, Thai, Polish and Hungarian equities, spicing more heavyweight selections like French short bonds and equities, Hong Kong equities, and Japanese blue chip industrial exporters. However, it does not like European industrial cyclicals, growth stocks around the globe, or D-Mark financial assets.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- MARKETS IN PERSPECTIVE  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                    % change    % change                   % change in local currency*     sterling*  in US Dlrs*               ----------------------------------------------------------               1 Week  4 Weeks  1 Year  Start of    Start of    Start of                                            1992        1992        1992  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Austria        +2.44    +2.59  -10.53    -10.53       +4.01      -15.83 Belgium       -0.50     -0.05   -1.80     -1.80      +14.06       -7.70 Denmark       -1.05     -0.83  -26.00    -26.00      -13.90      -30.33 Finland       -0.53     -1.62  +12.85    +12.85      +10.27      -10.78 France        +0.26     +3.50   +4.29     +4.29      +20.90       -2.17 Germany       +1.13     +0.99   -5.33     -5.33       +9.58      -11.33 Ireland       -0.21     +3.18  -12.88    -12.88       -0.01      -19.09 Italy         +1.91     +7.08   -6.63     -6.63      -10.06      -27.22 Netherlands   -0.27     +0.99   +5.54     +5.54      +22.55       -0.84 Norway        -1.20     -0.65  -10.67    -10.67       -4.81      -22.98 Spain         -2.21     +1.15  -11.68    -11.68       -7.87      -25.45 Sweden        -1.03     +5.69  +16.63    +16.63      +12.94       -8.60 Switzerland   +1.52     +7.47  +21.78    +21.78      +39.14      +12.59 UK            +0.59     +3.67  +14.93    +14.93      +14.93       -7.00 EUROPE        +0.49     +3.32   +6.29     +6.29      +13.81       -7.91  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Australia     +1.13     +8.97   -8.35     -8.35       +2.50      -17.06 Hong Kong     +1.04     +4.66  +25.02    +25.02      +55.25      +25.63 Japan         -3.43     +0.40  -22.74    -22.74       -4.44      -22.67 Malaysia      -1.17     -1.32  +17.35    +17.35      +50.86      +22.07 New Zealand   +1.61     +2.05   -4.03     -4.03      +12.81       -8.71 Singapore     +1.90     +5.56   -1.65     -1.65      +20.03       -2.88  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Canada        +0.79     +0.91   -6.72     -6.72       +4.85      -15.16 USA           -0.79     +0.88   +4.84     +4.84      +29.55       +4.84 Mexico        -0.13     +4.15  +21.53    +21.53      +46.39      +18.45  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- South Africa  +0.23     +0.51   -9.16     -9.16      -26.47      -40.50  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- WORLD INDEX   -1.06     +1.53   -3.67     -3.67      +14.06       -7.71  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * Based on December 31st 1992.

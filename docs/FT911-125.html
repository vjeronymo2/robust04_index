			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / Poll points to big Labour victory in Monmouth LABOUR IS heading for a sweeping victory in Thursday's by-election in Monmouth, according to an opinion poll which gives the party an 8 percentage point lead. The poll will intensify pressure from Conservative MPs for another cut in interest rates to ease the impact of the recession on the government's supporters in the southern half of England. In spite of the public reservations of the Treasury and the Bank of England, some ministers expect a  1/2 percentage point reduction in base rates this week. Mr John Major, the prime minister, is said to share their concern to see an across-the-board reduction in mortgage rates. On Friday figures are likely to show a sharp drop in the inflation rate last month to about 6 per cent. That could provide an appropriate backdrop for lower base rates. Some senior Conservatives, however, would like an earlier announcement in the hope of winning back wavering supporters in Monmouth, where the Tories are defending a majority of 9,350. Although Mr Major has now set his sights on autumn as the earliest possible date for a general election, ministers believe it is vital the voters feel the benefit of lower interest rates as quickly as possible. With unemployment set to rise sharply over the next few months, the government is basing its hopes of a strong electoral recovery on the expectation that lower inflation and interest rates will boost the incomes of those in work. However, colleagues of Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, acknowledge that he would risk destabilising sterling's strong position on the European exchange rate mechanism if he were seen by financial markets to be seeking to drive down borrowing costs too quickly. The Treasury yesterday sought to damp hopes of an imminent cut. Mr David Mellor, chief secretary to the Treasury, told BBC radio that the government would ease borrowing conditions only when prudent. The poll in Monmouth, carried out by NOP for HTV Wales and The Independent newspaper, gives Labour candidate Mr Huw Edwards 41 per cent, Tory candidate Mr Roger Evans 33 per cent and Mrs Frances David, for the Liberal Democrats, 24 per cent. Mr Mel Witherden, the joint Green/Plaid Cymru candidate, polled 1 per cent. Both Labour and the Tories were yesterday targeting Liberal Democrat voters for the last few days of the campaign, and emphasising that the contest was a straight fight between the two main parties. 'The situation remains as we have said all along,' said Tory campaigners. 'The choice for the people of Monmouth is clear: if they don't wish to be represented by a socialist in parliament they must back Roger Evans on Thursday.' Mr Edwards called the figures 'very encouraging'. He issued an appeal to Liberal Democrat supporters not to split the anti-Tory vote. Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, said the by-election remained 'wide open', while arguing that the survey showed the Tories could not win. 'The choice for this constituency, and especially for traditional Conservative voters, is now whether they want a Labour member of parliament or a Liberal Democrat MP born and bred in Monmouth,' he said. The party publishes its canvass returns this morning. NOP interviewed 1,106 people across the constituency between last Thursday and Sunday. Parliament, Page 11</p>

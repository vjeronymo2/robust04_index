			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: US chases ICI US buying ensured heavy volume in ICI shares following the hefty gain on Thursday when the company announced results, demerger details and a Pounds 1.3bn cash call. The shares were actively traded in New York on Thursday night where the American Depositary Receipts rose Dollars 3 1/4 . In London, they opened 19 ahead and moved forward steadily to close 55 1/2 up at 1208p on turnover of 10m. Prices were squeezed higher as many UK dealers were caught short by the extent of the US enthusiasm. Specialists said yesterday that the shares were rapidly approaching a resistance barrier between 1250p and 1350p and there was likely to be a lull in trading ahead of the rights issue in May. Meanwhile, chemicals group Courtaulds saw its shares rise 10 to 566p in sympathy with the ICI performance.</p>

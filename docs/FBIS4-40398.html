			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with National Bank President Nodar Javakhishvili </F> by Klara Grigolia; place and date not given: "How Are We To  Overcome Hyperinflation?"]    [Excerpts] The process of hyperinflation is raging. In  the view of our society, the prospects for halting it are  hopeless. There is only one glimmer of hope -- the  implementation of a severe financial and credit policy. We  spoke about this vitally important problem to Nodar  Javakhishvili, president of the Republic of Georgia National  Bank. [passage omitted]    [Javakhishvili] How can we overcome hyperinflation? We have  to start without delay to live within our means for at least two  to three months; that is to say, the Georgian population and  economy should use only what is produced. This concerns gas,  electric power, food products, and, in general, everything.  There is no perfect [system of] social justice. It is not  possible to save our country in the situation it is in under the  aegis of a perfect [system of] social justice. Far more  injustice will be committed under the aegis of social justice.  For example, the population is practically not being made to  pay taxes and if it is paying something, this is not to the  advantage of the state. The sole payer for the gas being  consumed is the republican budget whose source is the credit  emission from the National Bank; that is to say, with the money  used to pay for the gas being consumed, we are increasing the  amount of the money supply in circulation that has not been  secured and, in this way, money belonging to all citizens of  Georgia, including those who do not use gas, is being devalued.  Tbilisi, Rustavi, and Kutaisi are being supplied with gas; that  is to say, the price of gas consumed by me as an inhabitant of  Tbilisi is also being paid for by a peasant from Kiziqi through  the imposition of an inflationary tax; all the more so because,  in the environs of Tbilisi, many families use gas for heating,  hot water, and most importantly, for their hothouses. This  means that we have to change our psychology -- proceed not from  what we want or need, but according to our means; we should aim  to extend those means and use them efficiently, that is to say,  in reality, we should not have a budget deficit. A budget  deficit means more is being spent than earned; it is another  matter that we increase budgetary incomes (we are also obliged  to do so) at the expense of levying taxes. We should refrain  from issuing credits; this will bring instant stability to the  money market, although it will also not be our final salvation;  this will signify only a reduction of the temperature. However,  if we reduce this temperature, international society and, in  particular, the IMF, World Bank, and the European Bank [for  Reconstruction and Development] are ready today to render us  real and extensive assistance -- financial assistance -- that  should revive production and gradually secure a saturation of  goods on the consumer market.    At the same time, we should reduce the temperature with our  forces; this is their one firm condition, that is to say, either  we should continue to consume within today's parameters -- if we  consume just gas to the value of $300 million annually and  produce only one-tenth of this, we will alienate international  financial institutions that are keen to help us -- or we should  limit consumption for a few months in accordance with the  country's real potential.    Reducing the rate of inflation means that there should be an  improvement in the exchange rate of the coupon to the dollar and  a fall in the value of the dollar against the coupon. For  example, today, a salary of 500,000 coupons is equivalent to  half a dollar; if we reduce the inflation rate by 50 percent,  one dollar will be equivalent to 250,000 coupons.  Correspondingly, the population's savings will become more  solid and gradually increase in value in reality. We should not  concern ourselves with increasing wages, but with making them  more solid and strengthening the coupon.    Regarding the loans issued by the National Bank, retrieving  them has been entrusted to the law enforcement bodies and a  large part has already been recovered; however, there are still  many things that have to be done regarding those persons who  have left the republic. The law enforcement bodies are actively  working on this.    However, the problem is that the basic loans that have been  issued have been covered at face value, which we cannot call  being covered in reality as 100 million rubles lent in February  of last year is covered by 100 million coupons this year; this  represents practically no cover. It is necessary that profit  obtained as a result of the rate of inflation as hidden income  should be retrieved to the benefit of the state budget by the  corresponding law enforcement bodies, better still by the Tax  Inspectorate; this will be the most serious blow against  inflation and it is my firm belief that it will reduce the  budget deficit as this amounts to approximately $300 million.    As for the coupon, from the very first day it was  introduced,  this was a temporary transitional unit of payment; as can been  seen from its name, the coupon cannot be called money. It is a  part of securities that are given to its owner to enable him to  receive the dividend belonging to him. However, I believe that  we should achieve stability on the basis of this same coupon so  that we can protect real Georgian money. We are thinking of  introducing the lari [name of future new Georgian currency]  during the initial period of stability, but this will only  happen when we are conceptually absolutely ready for monetary  reform and, what is no less important, when we will have  financial guarantees that it will not suffer the same fate as  the coupon. The IMF is virtually giving us such guarantees  provided we fulfill their demands.    My attitude to the ruble zone is a negative one as I cannot  realistically envisage the creation of a ruble zone and our  having any prospects within it. Nobody should think that Russia  will accept such a country into the ruble zone and provide it  with funds and notes whose level of inflation is 10 times  higher, which in itself means that Russia will automatically and  without compensation assume responsibility for nine-tenths of  the country's general expenses. They will certainly demand from  us that we do not allow there to be a budget deficit and that we  bring credit emission and the inflation level into line with one  another. In the event of our implementing such measures, our  money will be on a par with the Russian ruble and the ruble zone  will have no significance at all for us; it will have already by  then resulted in the loss of the country's most important  attribute of sovereignty.    Today, very many people are speculating about the European  Union [EU] and the ECU although no one should think that the ECU  is a real monetary unit in Europe. In spite of trying for  decades and taking into account that the level of development of  [Western] European countries is very similar in each case, they  have been unable to achieve this aim in Europe; we can only  think about this when the former Soviet republics will have  similar economic levels, which, as in the case of the European  Union, will take decades.    Managing the country's economy, particularly bringing it out  of the very deep crisis, cannot be done by a monetary and credit  policy alone; it is necessary for all levels of power and the  whole of society to work in one direction; we are currently at  war, that is to say we are struggling to save the country's  statehood.    I view my minimum program as obtaining real assistance from  the international financial institutions and my maximum program  as building a truly independent state by means of a highly  developed banking system. Probably the reason why I can never  inwardly agree to the National Bank issuing loans today is that  we are dealing here with credit emission or money that does not  exist, which, in every case, leads to an acceleration in the  rate of inflation and is a mechanism for levying taxes upon the  population.    In today's conditions, there are very many things that we  need to do. We have already begun the training of specialists  for the banking system in Georgia, which is being undertaken by  the German Banking Academy under the aegis and with the  financial support of the European Union. There should be 280  trained specialists within one and a half years.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Who Is the Real Challenger" -- KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, May 12 (KCNA) -- The Japanese Government  authorities recently let out a string of ill-boding remarks,  grossly getting on our nerves.    Prime Minister Hata, referring to the "suspected nuclear  development" of the DPRK in his "policy speech" at the Diet on  Tuesday, said "it is a challenge" and it goes against the  "ideal" of Japan heading for "the final elimination of nuclear  weapons."    Earlier, on Monday, Director General of the Defence Agency  Kanda said in his inaugural "address" that "suspected nuclear  development and missile development of North Korea are a  challenge to the international community as a whole."    The very one who flung down the gauntlet against the entire  international community is none other than the Japanese  reactionaries who are gravely threatening peace and security in  Asia and the rest of the world by speeding up nuclear arming and  conversion of Japan into a military power.    It is Japan that has come into possession of nuclear bomb  manufacturing elements including electronic destructive devices,  and their technologies and started even the operation of  "Monju", a fast breeder reactor, some time ago.    It is also Japan that caused deep apprehensions in the  international community when it was learned recently that she  had stockpiled 70 kgs of plutonium in the plutonium fuel plant  beside the 26 tons stockpiled earlier.    Nevertheless, the Japanese Government authorities are  raising  a hue and cry over the "nuclear problem" of the DPRK, describing  it as a "challenge". This is, in the final analysis, nothing  but a crafty ruse to justify their own nuclear armament and  moves to turn Japan into a military power.</p>

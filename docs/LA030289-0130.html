			<p><P> March 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> GAF Trial to Continue: The federal judge hearing the stock manipulation case  against GAF Corp. and its vice chairman denied their motion to dismiss the  case. GAF and James Sherwin requested the dismissal after the government  concluded its arguments Tuesday. But U.S. District Judge Mary Johnson Lowe said  the government had presented sufficient evidence for the case to continue. The  government has charged GAF, a specialty chemical company, and Sherwin with  attempting to boost the price of Union Carbide shares in 1986.  </P></p>

			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading THE ANNOUNCEMENT of a support operation for sterling led to a squeeze in the derivatives market, producing one of its best performances since April, writes Joel Kibazo. In the futures sector, the September contract on the FT-SE Index, having opened at 2,346, traded in a tight range of 2,341 to 2,355 for most of the morning session with little in the way of feat-ures, although dealers reported sporadic buying. The announcement of an Ecu10bn currency support operation brought a squeeze in the September future which also played its part in pulling the underlying cash market higher. At the session's best, the contract was trading at around 30 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 6. Profit-taking just before the official close saw the contract surrender some of the gain. September closed at 2,411, up 83 from its previous close and around 27 points above the fair value premium to cash, with turnover reaching 10,282 contracts. Traded options were also active. Turnover rose to 41,665 lots from Wednesday's 27,621, with the FT-SE 100 option trading 12,439 contracts. Asda was the busiest stock option on 2,079 lots.</p>

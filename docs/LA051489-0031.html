			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TAPAS: INSTANT GRATIFICATION;  </P> <P> TWO NEW RESTAURANTS WHERE A TOSTADA IS A PIECE OF TOAST  </P> <P> Tasca, 6266 1/2 Sunset Boulevard, Hollywood. (213) 465-7747. Open  Monday-Saturday for lunch and dinner; for dinner only on Sunday. Full bar.  Street parking. American Express, Visa and MasterCard accepted. Dinner for two  (food only): $25-$50.  </P> <P>  From Spain, 11510 West Pico Boulevard, W. Los Angeles. (213) 479-6740. Open  Monday-Friday for lunch and dinner, Saturday for dinner only. This week only:  open Sunday, closed Monday. Beer and wine. Street parking (difficult). All  major credit cards accepted. Dinner for two (food only): $25-$45.  </P> <P>  There are three important things to remember about tapas, the so-called  "little bites" of Spain:  </P> <P> (1) They aren't dinner. The word tapa itself derives from the verb tapar, to  cover or stop up, and the original tapas were light snacks served on little  plates set on top of glasses of sherry, wine or beer -- to keep the flies out,  it is said. Though the definition of tapas has widened considerably over the  years, tapas are still basically bar food -- the Spanish version of peanuts and  hard-boiled eggs, if you will.  </P> <P> (2) With the exception of certain specialty items (mountain ham, fresh prawns  and the like) tapas don't cost very much. If it sets you back as much as $5 or  $6 a serving, chances are it ain't no tapa.  </P> <P>  (3) To paraphrase Lawrence Durrell, instantaneousness is implicit in tapas as  gravitation is inherent in mass. In other words, tapas are not cooked to order.  They're already there -- on or behind the bar -- at room temperature. You see  something you want, you point to it and it appears magically on a plate in  front of you. Tapas are instant gratification.  </P> <P> On the basis of these criteria, the new Spanish restaurant in Hollywood called  Tasca (a tasca is a tapas bar) doesn't fare very well. It cooks most of its  tapas to order, charges as much as $5 or $6 for at least some of them and  encourages patrons to make a whole dinner of them. But owner Rafael Gordon and  chef Eduardo Apitz do serve Spanish and nearly-Spanish food that is as good as  any I've had in Los Angeles -- and if it isn't absolutely authentic, well, who  cares?  </P> <P> The best way to approach Tasca (not to be confused with La Tasca, farther east  on Sunset) is to go with a party of four or more. Order six or eight dishes  that sound appealing (the menu descriptions are detailed and reasonably  accurate); reorder the ones you like and add a few new choices. Keep on going  until you've had enough, and then stop.  </P> <P> There's no real structure to a meal like this, no beginning/middle/end. It's  just one delicious, vividly flavored "little bite" of something after another.  For instance (and I list them in run-on order because that's exactly how the  diner at Tasca will encounter them): calamares a la romana, fried squid that's  tender, light, crisp, not greasy in the least . . . sweet red peppers, either  roasted in an olive-oil dressing or sauteed with oil and garlic . . . mild,  creamy salt cod and potato fritters (croquetas de bacalao) with an unusual  sauce of champagne, butter and assorted fresh herbs that seems to have almost  the flavor of fresh peas . . . pulpo, or octopus, in two forms, marinated in  vinaigrette and braised a la gallega in a nicely-rounded but not very spicy  paprika sauce . . . unusual empanadas, stuffed either with shredded chicken or  ground lamb, the latter mixed with pine nuts and raisins and both tasting  almost (East) Indian in their attractive, sweetish pungency . . . extraordinary  boquerones, small white-fleshed anchovies pickled with plenty of garlic and the  quick bite of hot red pepper . . . a credible if not exceptional wedge of  tortilla Espanola, the firm potato omelette that is practically the national  dish of Spain . . . the popular Venezuelan hors d'oeuvre known as tequenos,  sticks of cotija cheese dipped in batter and deep-fried . . . an agreeable  mushlike salad of eggplant, garlic and tomato . . . and, finally, a  surprisingly delicious potato salad, patatas con alcaparras y aneldo, flavored  with capers, dill and orange juice.  </P> <P>  Among the more substantial non-tapas offered are pescado a la andaluza made  with sea bass of passable quality and perfectly deep-fried (on the basis of  this dish and the aforementioned calamares, it seems safe to say that chef  Apitz understands the craft of deep-frying unusually well), and an item rather  portentiously named "El Cordero," or "The Lamb," which is lamb loin stuffed  with ham, spinach and Manchego cheese cut into rounds and arranged atop a  large, thin lengthwise slice of eggplant sauteed in a cilantro and basil  batter. The whole thing is moistened with a serious red wine sauce. When a  group of us ordered two portions of The Lamb one evening, the meat in one case  came out with a musty left-over-in-the-refrigerator taste; in the other case,  the dish was fresh and wonderful.  </P> <P> The wine list is perfunctory but fairly priced (1986 Sonoma-Cutrer Russian  River Ranches Chardonnay at $20 and 1984 Joseph Phelps Napa Valley Cabernet  Sauvignon at $22 are the most expensive table wines). Unfortunately, it offers  only four Spanish wines (not counting sherry), none particularly distinguished  -- plus a drinkable Chardonnay and Cabernet from Chile (at $13 and $15,  respectively).  </P> <P> The dining room is blessedly free from the usual Spanish-restaurant cliches  (bullfight posters, wrought-iron gratings, etc.). Instead it has a clean,  pleasantly rustic look, with whitewashed walls, red tile floors, and beam  ceilings -- a nice place to relax as the tapas issue forth.  </P> <P> Recommended dishes: patatas con alcaparras y aneldo ($2.95), pulpo a la gallega  ($3.95), boquerones en vinagre ($3.95), croquetas de bacalao ($4.55), calamares  a la romana ($4.95), empanadas ($5.95), El Cordero ($8.95).  </P> <P> </P> <P> Another new addition to the city's small Spanish restaurant population is a  simple storefront  </P> <P> in West Los Angeles called From Spain. Here, there are bullfight posters (and  photos) on the wall as part of a functional decor that includes pistachio-green  polyester tableclothes and auditorium-style folding chairs. The chef and owner  of the place is Juan Rodriguez, who hails from Badalona, a seaside town a few  miles from Barcelona. For a time, he cooked at the now-closed Barcelona  restaurant in Santa Monica and then at Miami Spice, a flashy Cuban place in  Venice.  </P> <P> Rodriguez marks a portion of his menu tapas, but From Spain is more a  conventional restaurant than a tapas bar, and the dishes so identified serve  very well as just plain appetizers. Some of them are very good -- for instance,  delicious medium-sized mussels, well-cleaned and glazed with cream and white  wine; a dish identified as boquerones a la plancha, not the tiny anchovylike  fish mentioned above but fresh sardines -- truly a delicious variety of fish --  grilled perfectly and scattered with bits of well-browned garlic; and some  excellent Spanish-style chorizo sausage (from a producer in San Jose, Calif.),  thinly sliced and sauteed in olive oil. The roasted red peppers are just fine,  too, but the anchovies that supposedly accompany them have been applied with a  very light hand. Pan con jamon, literally "bread with ham," which is, in fact,  the ubiquitous Catalan snack of bread rubbed with the cut side of a fresh  half-tomato, seasoned with olive oil and salt and served with ham or anchovies,  is made with very good bread and very good ham (also from San Jose) -- but the  bread, on at least one occasion, was dry, as if the tomatoes weren't juicy  enough and the oil had perhaps been added by the same person responsible for  putting anchovies on the roasted pepper.  </P> <P> From Spain offers a number of fish and seafood dishes as main courses (i.e.,  grilled baby salmon with spicy tomato sauce and a version of the Catalan  seafood stew called sarsuela), but the kitchen seems more confident with such  straightforward, hearty meat dishes as chuletas de puerco, chewy but flavorful  grilled pork chops with a sweet red pepper sauce; chuletas de cordero, grilled  thin lamb chops with a wonderfully intense alioli (a sort of garlic mayonnaise)  on the side, or an occasional special of cochinillo, crisp roasted suckling  pig, served in ample quantity to the accompaniment of a plate of roasted  peppers. Crema Catalana, the Catalan version of creme brulee, is appropriately  crisp on top and creamy underneath.  </P> <P> Torres house wines -- red, white, and rose -- at $12 a bottle accompany the  food here more than adequately, but a small selection of other good Spanish  vintages is offered -- including 1983 C.U.N.E. Rioja at $16, 1971 Marques de  Carceres Rioja Riserva at $29, and 1971 Torres Gran Coronas Black Label at $40.  </P> <P> Recommended dishes: chorizo frito ($4.50), boquerones a la plancha ($4.95),  chuletas de puerco ($9.95), chuletas de cordero ($13.95), cochinillo ($15.95),  crema Catalana ($2.95).  </P></p>

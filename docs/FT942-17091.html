			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / Greek fiscal bill targets tax evaders Greece's socialist government yesterday unveiled a fiscal package designed in part to counter what it believes to be rampant tax evasion. The bill, due to go before parliament this week, raises the top income tax rate from 40 to 45 per cent, places an additional 15 per cent tax on dividends from mutual funds and investment companies, and sets criteria for taxing self-employed professionals like architects, doctors and lawyers, groups who are considered to grossly underestimate their income in order to avoid tax. The new dividends tax comes on top of a 35 per cent tax on equity income which is withheld at source. Greeks are nevertheless required to declare all their equity holdings, together with other non-taxable assets, which are considered indicators of wealth for future tax assessment. 'Probably fewer than 10 per cent of investors put down their holdings on their income tax forms,' said one fund manager yesterday. Mutual funds are currently the fastest growing sector of Greece's financial market with about 80 companies, mostly private Greek banks and insurance concerns, controlling more than Dr1,300bn (Pounds 3.55bn). The new fiscal measure is expected to put a temporary brake on that growth and drive liquidity into tax-free government securities. The socialist administration faces problems in financing the public sector deficit, with a serious revenue shortfall projected this year - the increase in tax revenues for the first two months of this year was less than half the budget projection. The government borrowing requirement is forecast to exceed 15 per cent of gross domestic product against a target of 12.9 per cent. Other measures included in the new bill are a requirement for taxpayers to disclose the source of funds used to buy property, an important repository for income from the black economy, now estimated to be worth close to 40 per cent of gross domestic product. Personal income tax receipts in Greece amount to only about 4.5 per cent of GDP, the lowest percentage in the European Union, while the average income declared by self-employed businessmen and professionals is only half that declared by wage earners. Mr Alexandros Papadopoulos, finance minister, made a point when introducing the new measures yesterday of stressing that they were not intended to damp growth in the financial sector. He noted that the bill did not require disclosures on the source of funds used to buy shares on the Athens stock exchange. To stimulate more flotations of Greek companies, which still tend to be tightly controlled by family owners and managers, the corporate tax rate for unlisted companies will be raised from 35 to 40 per cent.</p>

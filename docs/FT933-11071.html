			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / Rabin faces his greatest challenge: Israel's PM is being dragged into Lebanese mire MR Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, is facing his greatest challenge since taking office a year ago: how to draw Israel's bombardment of southern Lebanon to a close in a way that maximises his domestic standing, wins back international support and advances his government's peace agenda while continuing to guarantee what he sees as the country's security. Having gone in to Lebanon expecting quicker results, Mr Rabin now faces the prospect of being sucked into the Lebanese quagmire, as Israel was when it invaded in 1982, and is scrambling around for ways to get out with tangible benefits. The relentless bombardment of Lebanese civilians has alienated international opinion, including the US, threatened the Middle East peace process and revealed political strains in his coalition government. Yet it has also exposed one of the foundations of Mr Rabin's premiership: his belief that only by acting tough can he force Arab states into concessions in the peace process and maintain a broad popular base for the best peace deal. 'Rabin is committed to peace but don't forget he was elected on a narrow margin because people saw him as a strongman who made no concessions on the security of Israel,' said Mr Yoel Marcus, an Israeli political commentator. 'He can say to the public: trust me in peace talks because the first thing on my mind will be a deal which does not harm Israel's existence and its security.' Supporters of Mr Rabin's labour-led coalition - the left-wing Meretz party and the five Arab MPs - continue to criticise the Israeli operation as 'immoral,' largely for its tragic impact on the lives of half a million Shia villagers in southern Lebanon. At least half the cabinet, including four Labour ministers, have voiced their opposition to the operation. But the ability of the cabinet and parliamentary critics to influence Mr Rabin remains severely circumscribed by the initial popularity of the action and by the fact that any serious threat to the coalition could pave the way to a return to power by the right-wing Likud party. An opinion poll in the Yediot Ahronoth newspaper yesterday showed 93 per cent of Israelis supported the action when interviewed on Wednesday. For the moment, Mr Rabin has successfully boosted his image as a tough and unrepentant warrior for Israel - undermining the claims of Likud as the party of 'security.' However, there are political limitations and diplomatic dangers with this policy. Any commitment of ground troops in Lebanon could place unbearable strains on the coalition and quickly turn the public, which remains haunted by the disastrous 1982 war with Lebanon, against the government. Political analysts say Mr Rabin is still haunted by the memories of the 1967 Middle East war when he was Chief of Staff and continues to see peace with Syria as the main ambition of his premiership. He views the pro-Iranian Hizbollah guerrillas, the ostensible target of the offensive, and the Lebanese government itself, as proxies of Syrian interests in the region. Analysts say at least part of Mr Rabin's strategy is to show Syria and other Arab states that Israel under Labour has not gone soft and will negotiate from a position of strength. Mr Rabin also aims to exert maximum pressure on Syria to make concessions on a comprehensive regional peace deal. The deal would involve the phased return of most or all of the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights to Syria in return for full peace, including trade and diplomatic relations and guaranteed security on both the Israeli-Syrian and the Israeli-Lebanese borders. Israel would also agree a phased withdrawal from southern Lebanon. Senior government officials believe the present crisis could be turned into an opportunity with the involvement of the US. But this would assume Damascus, Beirut and Washington would accept a delinking of the Palestinian and Jordanian talks from those with Syria and Lebanon - a move many believe is unlikely. Critics, however, say Mr Rabin's military strategy, which remains unsuccessful so long as Hizbollah continues to hit Israel with rockets, depends far too much on a response from the other side. After President Bill Clinton's praise for 'Syrian restraint' during the conflict they say Israel will have to pay a price to Syria at the negotiating table for allowing Damascus to emerge as the key to a regional solution. Furthermore, they believe that without a durable peace deal, the operation could swell the ranks of Hizbollah, destabilise Lebanon, and create a worsening security threat to Israel. Mr Rabin's offensive against Lebanon was always risky. Unless a there is a breakthrough soon, it is difficult to see how the prime minister will be able to extricate himself from the crisis unscathed both at home and abroad. The longer the conflict continues, the greater the risks to Mr Rabin's international and domestic standing and to the entire Middle East peace process.</p>

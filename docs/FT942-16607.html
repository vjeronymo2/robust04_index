			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / US frustrated by failed promise of trade reform: Washington's hopes are being pinned on Ichiro Ozawa and his commitment to institutional change President Bill Clinton's public 'regret' yesterday at the resignation of Mr Morihiro Hosokawa as Japanese prime minister could not disguise the increasing US frustration at the virtual paralysis of his government. The US trade negotiating strategy with Japan had been predicated on the belief that Mr Hosokawa was a reformer, keen to take on those Japanese bureaucrats seen in Washington as the stumbling block to greater access for US goods and services. Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, and other officials consistently maintained that US pressure on Japan was designed to reinforce, not undermine, a premier whose domestic popularity had been remarkably high by recent Japanese standards. Even the most recent ratcheting up of this pressure, with the naming of Japan as an unfair trader under the terms of the revived Super 301 trade process, was seen in Washington as a means of giving Mr Hosokawa's government more time to respond. Although Japan came up with a plan to give Motorola of the US greater opportunities in the cellular phone market, other Japanese policies, including a budget stimulus, have been stalled. Over time this frustration has more than offset the reasonable personal rapport between the two leaders, both previously provincial governors. Even after their abortive summit in February, which failed to resolve outstanding trade differences, Mr Clinton entertained Mr Hosokawa for a social breakfast at the White House. But even as they ate, US officials were investigating political alternatives in Tokyo. Mr Tsutomu Hata, the foreign minister and a possible successor to Mr Hosokawa, has become reasonably well known in Washington, but without ever transcending the barrier of being just another fungible Japanese politician whose interests are principally domestic. Increasingly, hopes have been pinned on Mr Ichiro Ozawa, the former LDP cabinet member and now the political power, such as it is, in the Hosokawa cabinet, as a man who could get things done behind the scenes. Much as Mr Hosokawa's brief memoirs before he became prime minister became useful reading in Washington, so has Mr Ozawa's recent publication - Blueprint for Building a New Japan. Washington understands that Mr Ozawa has political problems of his own in Japan but his commitment to domestic institutional reform and a strong US relationship is considered an advantage and it is hoped he remains in a position of influence in the new government. One senior White House policy-maker was recently asked if he was worried about Mr Ozawa's scandal-tainted reputation as the 'Richard Nixon of Japan'. He replied: 'What's wrong with that?'</p>

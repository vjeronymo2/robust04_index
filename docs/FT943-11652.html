			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / Receivers to Swans gloomy on rescue The receivers to Swan Hunter, the Tyneside shipbuilder facing closure, last night voiced grave doubts about a proposal from the sole prospective bidder for the company. Joint receiver Mr Ed James of Price Waterhouse said outline proposals from French-owned Soffia/CMN would need be 'significantly improved', both in terms of the price offered and Swans' substantial continuing operating costs pending a sale, for there to be any chance of agreement. He said he had invited Mr Iskandar Safa, head of Soffia, parent company of patrol boat builder Constructions Mecaniques de Normandie, to meet him immediately, but warned the yard's future prospects were 'extremely uncertain'. Mr Safa has said he will not buy Swans, which runs out of work in November, unless it has a guaranteed two-year, Pounds 50m workload. An attempt to fulfil this by winning the refit of the landing ship Sir Bedivere failed last week when Rosyth won the order. A decision by the receivers to seek more work for Swans, in the hope that Soffia would then buy it, would be a costly gamble; tendering for an MoD ocean survey vessel, the most imminent order prospect, would cost between Pounds 500,000 and Pounds 1m. The receivers have said there are no other prospective buyers.</p>

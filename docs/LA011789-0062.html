			<p><P> January 17, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Britain's Court of Appeal was ordered to review the convictions of four alleged  Irish Republican Army guerrillas jailed 14 years ago for bombings of pubs. Home  Secretary Douglas Hurd said he is reopening the case after a campaign supported  by church leaders, former Cabinet ministers and two senior judges who said new  evidence showed the four may be innocent. The four, Carole Richardson, Paddy  Armstrong, Paul Hill and Gerard Conlon, are serving life sentences for the  murder of five people killed when two pubs were bombed in Guildford near London  in 1974. They were found guilty on the strength of confessions to police that  they claimed were extracted under duress and that were retracted at their  trial.  </P></p>

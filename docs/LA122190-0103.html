			<p><P> December 21, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOWARD ROSENBERG: TIME RIPE FOR NEW KCET LABEL . . . INCONSISTENT;  </P> <P> TELEVISION: IF THE STATION THINKS THAT 'SOUTH AFRICA NOW' IS THE ONLY SHOW IT  AIRS THAT IS OPINIONATED, THEN ITS HEAD IS REALLY BURIED IN THE SAND.  </P> <P> Three cheers for KCET's decision to renew "South Africa Now," the valuable,  feisty little series it earlier sought to cancel after charging that the weekly  half hour was slanted toward the African National Congress (ANC).  </P> <P> Produced by Globalvision, "South Africa Now" has been a public relations  nightmare for KCET.  </P> <P> Obviously believing its viewers are frightfully confused, however, KCET has  decided to label the series a "point of view," making "South Africa Now" the  only program in the KCET schedule given such special consideration.  </P> <P> The station says the series, which has been airing 9 a.m. Sundays, "does not  consistently meet KCET standards for fairness and balance in news programming."  </P> <P> Then, of course, KCET had to take a stand. The one thing that none of us wants  is for KCET to compromise its standards.  </P> <P> But wait. If "South Africa Now" doesn't meet KCET standards, then why is the  station running it? Because it has caved into pressure after facing loud public  protests over its earlier decision to cancel the series? And if KCET is so  easily bullied, is it now caving into pressure from the right in announcing  that the series will subsequently carry a "point of view" tag?  </P> <P> In any event, how about some consistency? This is no time for KCET to be stingy  with labels.  </P> <P> If "South Africa Now" is a "point of view," then William F. Buckley's "Firing  Line" and "John McLaughlin's One on One" -- series that KCET runs back to back  on Saturday afternoons -- are flat-out archconservative polemics. Buckley and  MacLaughlin would be deeply wounded to learn that KCET thinks they have no  point of view.  </P> <P> Plus, if the venerable "Wall Street Week" isn't a bastion of conservative  thinking on fiscal matters, what is?  </P> <P> There's more. If KCET thinks the recent Bill Moyers-reported "Frontline"  program, "High Crimes and Misdemeanors," lacked a generally liberal point of  view on the Iran-Contra affair, then it wasn't watching. If it disputes that  this week's "Frontline" program, "The Spirit of Crazy Horse," was a  near-unchallenged endorsement of American Indian grievances against the federal  government, then its head is really buried in the sand.  </P> <P> And finally, what are KCET's very own beloved and endlessly recurring Pledge  Week pitches for operating funds if not a "point of view" consisting of one  unchallenged standing ovation after another in favor of the programs and  policies of KCET and PBS? How about a label for them?  </P> <P> On the other hand, when word gets around that KCET is running a series that  doesn't meet its standards, then maybe no one will give.  </P> <P> Arsenio Hall had a point the other night when he was challenged on his show by  two gay activists who stood in the audience and demanded that he have more gay  guests.  </P> <P> Which of his guests are gay really isn't any of their business. As a matter of  fact, the protesters were arguing from ignorance. They had no idea how many of  Hall's guests have been gay because not every gay person publicly announces his  or her sexual preference. Was it the opinion of the protesters that only  out-of-the-closet gays qualify as homosexuals?  </P> <P> Moreover, what a dumb move by them in the first place, as if they would somehow  be able to bully Hall on his own show and make a point with the public. His  show is on tape, so if he had ended up looking bad, the entire exchange could  have been edited out.  </P> <P> As it turned out, however, the ambushers were ambushed by the ambushee.  </P> <P> They walked right into the whirling propeller, allowing Hall to chew them into  confetti with a self-servingly sanctimonious tirade that had him coming across  as a sort of heroic black champion who had been wronged by these two intruding  sluggos.  </P> <P> And, of course, the shouting and carrying on was kept in the show because, no  matter the source or circumstances, good TV is always good TV.  </P> <P> Dick Vitale is always bad TV.  </P> <P> Awesome, baby! That isn't a mouth between Vitale's nose and chin, it's an  active volcano, a conduit through which hot, molten, gaseous verbiage is  ejected onto every telecast he works as No. 1 college basketball analyst for  ESPN and ABC. His verbosity literally destroys the game.  </P> <P> Vitale's point of view is himself. He takes a back seat to no one in his  capacity to bury everything he covers with these epic eruptions that are passed  off as commentary. He does his homework, but somehow twists nearly every piece  of information he retains into something that comes off as self-serving.  </P> <P> He may be a swell guy in person. But everything about Vitale on the air screams  Me! Me! Me! He just won't let up. Overbearing? A hammy upstager? Compared to  Vitale, Howard Cosell is Mr. Peepers, and John Madden -- the CBS pro football  commentator whose carefully cultivated reputation for uncontrolled loudness has  earned him millions -- is a barely audible whisper.  </P> <P> Instead of one team versus another when Vitale works a basketball telecast, its  Vitale versus the game, with him the inevitable winner and viewers the losers.  </P></p>

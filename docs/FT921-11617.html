			<p>920130 FT  30 JAN 92 / International Company News: Danish financial group to cut 400 staff TOPDANMARK, the Danish insurance and banking group, is to dismiss about 400 employees, some 13 per cent of the staff, as part of a programme to streamline the organisation and improve earnings. Nine branches of the group's bank, Aktivbanken, will be closed this year, the group said. Topdanmark's 1991 results are expected to be negative following an increase by DKr200m (Dollars 161,000) in loss provisions for the bank following an increase in provisions policy by the Danish supervisory authority. The bank's loss provisions in 1990 were DKr169m; group profit was DKr52m. Earlier, the group predicted profits of DKr50m to DKr75m for 1991, by it said yesterday that 'results will be reduced by an amount equal to the loss incurred by Aktivbanken'. Topdanmark is negotiating an alliance with Sweden's Wasa, AVCB of the Netherlands, and the UK's Friends Provident. The Danish group said that its streamlining programme will mean fewer levels of management and less bureaucracy. The purpose is to create a state-of-the-art organisation for the sale of banking and insurance services.</p>

			<p><P> October 19, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GORBACHEV OUT TO GET HIM, YELTSIN SAYS;  </P> <P> SOVIET UNION: OTHER RADICALS FEAR THEY ARE BEING SILENCED IN A RETURN TO  CONSERVATISM.  </P> <P> In a bitter attack on President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, radical populist Boris N.  Yeltsin accused the Soviet leader Wednesday of trying to drive him from  politics in order to prepare for a sharp swing back to conservatism.  </P> <P> Yeltsin, a member of the Supreme Soviet, the national legislature, said his  popularity and his leadership of a new opposition group within the Supreme  Soviet has "aroused fierce antagonism" among conservatives in the Communist  Party and government bureaucracy and that they are now working to purge him.  </P> <P> Suggesting that Gorbachev fears him because of his grass-roots support, Yeltsin  charged the party leader with orchestrating a campaign of media attacks and  malicious rumors to discredit him.  </P> <P> The latest attempt, Yeltsin said, was a "political farce." He said this took  place when the Supreme Soviet, at Gorbachev's initiative, this week discussed  allegations -- "a mixture of truth and lies" -- that Yeltsin had faked an  assassination attempt.  </P> <P> In recent weeks, Yeltsin's behavior has become a matter of intense speculation,  fueled by articles in the official press and footage shown on television. He  has been accused of being drunk almost throughout his recent tour of the United  States, of brawling with opponents and, most recently, of being the victim of  the assassination attempt.  </P> <P> "All these are links in one and the same chain of actions to destroy me, and  they are being carried out under the leadership of Comrade M. S. Gorbachev,"  Yeltsin said in a formal statement given to correspondents at the Supreme  Soviet.  </P> <P> Other radicals complained Wednesday of what they see as new moves against them  by Gorbachev and the party leadership and expressed fears that they are being  silenced as part of a conservative retrenchment.  </P> <P> "We are facing an attempt at revenge by conservative forces for their defeat in  last spring's elections," political analyst Yevgeny Ambarsumov said Wednesday  in the weekly Moscow News, warning with other radicals of a coordinated  conservative counterattack on them and, they believe, on the overall reform  program.  </P> <P> Thirty-five members of the Congress of People's Deputies, the broad-based  assembly, sent a formal question to Gorbachev on Wednesday demanding an  explanation for his harsh criticism of a prominent radical deputy, historian  Yuri N. Afanasyev, and of the editor of the country's most popular newspaper,  the weekly Arguments and Facts.  </P> <P> But a spokesman for the group was refused permission to address the Supreme  Soviet on Wednesday when Anatoly I. Lukyanov, the Soviet first vice president,  ruled that the matter was a Communist Party affair and out of order.  </P> <P> Gorbachev, speaking to a group of senior newspaper editors last Friday, had  accused much of the Soviet press of carrying too many critical reports on the  country's problems without making constructive suggestions.  </P> <P> He reportedly compared the political situation to a lake of gasoline that one  match could set alight.  </P> <P> According to widely circulated reports of the meeting, Gorbachev accused  Arguments and Facts, which has a circulation of more than 26 million, of  virtually seeking his ouster with its reports. He suggested that its editor,  Vladislav A. Starkov, resign.  </P> <P> But a number of editors, including several of those criticized, told their  staffs later not to be too concerned. Gorbachev has routinely called them  together over the last three years for similar sessions in order to "curb our  lust for criticism and debate," as one journalist said.  </P></p>

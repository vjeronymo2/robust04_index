			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Sources described as informed have said that the  Palestinian-Israeli Liaison Committee, which is chaired by  brother Abu-Mazin [Mahmud 'Abbas], member of the PLO Executive  Committee, and Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, will meet  next Thursday [28 April] if the current dispute over a number of  issues before the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations persists.  Each side is insisting on its stance vis-a-vis a number of  fundamental issues.    Palestinian sources have said that the Israeli side in the  negotiations is insisting on its position regarding the topic of  travel documents that the self-rule authority will provide to  the Palestinian citizens. They are insisting on writing State  of Israel on the cover while the Palestinian side stresses that  this is unacceptable because it deprives the self rule of all  authority.    The other fundamental point of contention is the subjugation  of the coasts of Gaza to an Israeli authority, especially in the  Khan Yunis area.    Regarding passage between Jericho and Gaza, the Israeli  position has retracted in the new round of negotiations,  expressing reservations over the passage linking the two areas.  The Israeli side is proposing to make the link by air in order  to avoid accidents in the future. The Israeli side also refuses  to grant the right of the self-ruling authority to issue postage  stamps under the pretext that what is being negotiated is a  transitional self rule, while the travel document and the stamps  represent manifestations of a state.

			<p>920111 FT  11 JAN 92 / Letter: Election day is for those who run the show Sir, Observer wonders ('Thursday puzzle', January 6) why every general election in the UK is held on a Thursday. Surely the reason is that, should it result in a change of government, the new prime minister can go to Buckingham Palace to kiss hands on the Friday and select his/her senior ministers over the weekend, thus causing the least disruption to the mandarins who, after all, are the ones who really run the show. Let us emulate the continentals and hold our elections on Sundays - so that school children won't lose a day's schooling. The mandarins do not need to worry this year - for there isn't going to be a change of government. John V C Butcher, Chestnut Heights, 18 Bramble Rise, Cobham, Surrey KT11 2HP</p>

			<p><P> September 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 80 AMERICAN HOSTAGES FLY OUT OF IRAQ;  </P> <P> FAMILIES: HUNDREDS OF WESTERN WOMEN DEPART WITH THEIR CHILDREN. HUSBANDS ARE  LEFT BEHIND. BAGHDAD CALLS IT A HUMANITARIAN AIRLIFT.  </P> <P> Amid the tears of families torn in half and the memories of a month in Iraqi  captivity, hundreds of Western women and children, including at least 80  Americans, flew to freedom today in what was billed as a massive humanitarian  airlift by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.  </P> <P> The hostage release came after midnight and after a maddening series of delays,  agonizing farewells and intensive international diplomacy, but it left behind  thousands of American, European and Japanese men who are either held under  military guard at strategic installations or simply barred from leaving Iraqi  territory.  </P> <P> In a few cases, Western women who were told to report with their husbands to  pick up their exit visas had to watch their men taken away by security  officials, presumably adding to President Hussein's human shield.  </P> <P> "They basically traded the husband for the visa," said one Western diplomat.  </P> <P> "In actual fact, we're not free," said Hillary Westwood, a British hostage who  had to leave her husband behind at the strategic Iraqi camp where they were  held for 11 of their 30 days under armed guard.  </P> <P> "We're still going to be hostages in (Britain) -- hostage to everything that  happens here."  </P> <P> Standing beside her as she waited in the departure line at Saddam International  Airport, fellow Briton Kirsty Norman added, "This isn't going to be over for us  until everybody gets back."  </P> <P> Dawn Bazner, who was en route to her in-laws' home in Palm Desert, Calif., in  part because her husband, Kevin, had appealed personally to President Hussein  for the release of the women and children on an international broadcast by  Iraqi Television, said simply that she needs time to think before she speaks.  </P> <P> "For now," she said, "our main purpose is to get our children to safety."  </P> <P> There were only a handful of men among the evacuees, most of them among the 26  Americans hiding out in Kuwait whose release was secured by a persistent Jesse  Jackson during a Friday night meeting with President Hussein and continuous  negotiations in Kuwait throughout Saturday.  </P> <P> Jackson, who visited both Iraq and Kuwait as an official state guest of the  Iraqi government, made a second trip to the Iraqi-occupied capital of Kuwait  city on Saturday to collect the sick Americans from the besieged U.S. Embassy  compound there. His late return to Baghdad delayed all of the hostages'  departure by an additional four hours.  </P> <P> "This is a window of hope, and it must be expanded," Jackson told a wire  service reporter at the airport.  </P> <P> He said he was encouraged by his meetings with Hussein, whom he found ready to  talk. "When people are willing to talk, that is a step in the first direction,"  Jackson said. "There must be a cooling of the rhetoric in this quest for  peace."  </P> <P> Jackson, who took to Kuwait city several Western journalists from Baghdad and  three film crews from his new television program who had accompanied him to  Iraq, also flew out of Baghdad with 237 released detainees journeying to Paris,  London and Washington aboard a state-owned Iraqi Airways Boeing 747.  </P> <P> In all, there were three evacuation flights Saturday, the principal one being  the Iraqi Airways flight that Baghdad had requested as a last-minute  negotiating point so it could pick up Iraqis stranded in Paris and London. The  Iraqi government did, however, fly all 237 detainees home free of charge.  </P> <P> A chartered Airbus of Lufthansa, West Germany's flag carrier, took out an  additional 260 women and children, among them Americans and Europeans from 10  countries who had not been detained at camps, factories, refineries, power  plants and storage depots but were stuck in Baghdad under presidential orders  barring most foreigners from leaving the country.  </P> <P> A third Iraqi-financed flight took 68 Japanese women and children detainees on  an Iraqi Airways Boeing 727 to a waiting Japan Air Lines flight in Amman,  Jordan. According to the Japanese Embassy in Baghdad, an additional 143  Japanese men remain in detention at installations throughout Iraq.  </P> <P> U.S. and West German officials said that the flights carried up to 22 American  women and children who had been locked up in camps and at other sites in Iraq,  in addition to 58 American wives and children who were leaving their husbands  and fathers behind at the families' homes in Iraq and Kuwait.  </P> <P> An estimated 600 Americans were in Iraq and 2,500 more in Kuwait at the time of  the Aug. 2 invasion that touched off the military crisis in the Persian Gulf  and the hostage drama in Iraq.  </P> <P> President Hussein, who met twice in internationally telecast sessions with the  detained hostages -- "guests" who he said were recipients of "forced  hospitality" -- has publicly announced that they are needed as a shield to  prevent an American air strike and a prolonged bloody conflict. His advisers  also say that the hostages are key pressure points on American allies  participating in the Western military buildup in the gulf region.  </P> <P> "They are Saddam's insurance against an attack," a European military expert in  Baghdad said of the husbands and fathers whom the released hostages were  leaving behind on Saturday night. "Militarily, he cannot afford to let these  people go now -- not until most of the American forces are out of the area."  </P> <P> A Western diplomat, noting that the release was clearly timed to coincide with  talks between U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar and Iraqi Foreign  Minister Tarik Aziz in Jordan, added, "It's definitely a peace signal -- a  peace offensive, but the West will not look at it that way.  </P> <P> Indeed, at Saddam International Airport on Saturday night, there was ample  evidence of the human cost of the Iraqi president's insurance policy.  </P> <P> Women quietly commiserated with each other over the fate of their husbands.  Single women wept over the men friends they had taken along to protect them as  they were moved in detention from installation to installation. A child cried  for her father.  </P> <P> Most of the released American hostages refused to speak for the record.  </P> <P> "They've fooled us so many times," one middle-aged American said of the mixed  bag of messages they have received from their captors during the past month.  "And then, there's our men. I don't think we'll talk much even after we get out  of here."  </P> <P> The Britons, by far the largest group of women and children with about 200  evacuees, were far more open, though just as concerned about their husbands and  fathers. Most asked that their husbands' names not be used, nor would most  specify where they had been held, although all insisted that they had been well  treated and cared for by their guards.  </P> <P> "They were extremely pleasant to us, but it was bizarre," said Hillary  Westwood, who was captured along with her friend, Caroline Johnson, and their  husbands  </P> <P> on Aug. 18 while trying to escape from Kuwait through the desert.  </P> <P> In explaining their decision to make a run for it after 16 days of hiding at  various places in Kuwait city, Westwood said, "In fact, we'd given up hope of  ever getting out of there."  </P> <P> But they gave up on their journey, as well, after encountering a desert horizon  virtually covered with Iraqi tanks and troops, and it was on their return to  Kuwait city that they were caught by an army patrol and taken to an Iraqi  military camp.  </P> <P> "We didn't want to split up," she added of the decision she and her husband  were given 45 minutes to make. "But I've got two kids in the U.K. So what  decision do you make? Someone's got to take care of the kids."  </P> <P> Apparently disclosing that some Western women and children remain hostage in  Iraq, Westwood added that seven British women and two children in their group  chose to stay behind with their husbands and fathers at the strategic sites.  </P> <P> There were some lighter moments. Arti Lakhani, a Canadian, was en route to be  married in the south Indian city of Madras when she became a hostage along with  most of her 368 fellow passengers on British Airways Flight 149 when it was  stranded in Kuwait during the invasion.  </P> <P> "He better still want to get married," she said with a laugh, as she sent her  bags through the airport metal detector.  </P> <P> But even Lakhani's eyes began to water when she spoke of "the three guys we  dragged along to look after us," three men who remain under detention somewhere  in Iraq.  </P> <P> "I'm really happy to be getting out, of course," the 28-year-old British-born  woman said. "But it's such a downside, the guys we left. You live 11 days with  someone, and, well, you really start to care. You get close. And it's very  difficult to let them go."  </P> <P> For American attorney Debbie Willis, a 32-year-old native of Portland, Me., it  was her husband, Jerry, she had to leave behind. And, after 3 1/2 years of  working for a law firm in Kuwait city, it was the Kuwaiti people, too, she said  she will miss.  </P> <P> "It just looked like no one was going anywhere, and we were afraid for the  Kuwaiti friends who were hiding us," she said in explaining their decision to  load up their four-wheel-drive vehicle and make a dash across the desert to  Saudi Arabia after days in hiding. Like Westwood and many other detainees, they  were caught trying.  </P> <P> "I'm happy to be going home," she said. "I'm happy to be alive. But I'm leaving  my husband behind, and I'm sad about it. What more can I say?"  </P> <P> In other even more extraordinary cases, though, the evacuation literally tore  entire families apart.  </P> <P> Nidhal Anaim, an Iraqi-born mother of three who now lives in Los Angeles as an  American citizen, wept uncontrollably as she hugged, kissed and caressed her  Iraqi relatives, bidding goodby Saturday afternoon outside the U.S. Embassy,  which served as a staging area for the American women and children going home.  </P> <P> Like many Iraqi-Americans, Anaim has one foot in each of the two nations that  are now staring each other down in a potentially explosive war of nerves, and  she said she is deeply concerned about the safety of those she is leaving  behind in her native Baghdad.  </P> <P> She came to Iraq for a month's vacation with the relatives on July 4 and was to  return to America about the time of the Iraqi invasion, which trapped her  between two worlds of love and loyalty.  </P> <P> Asked who had come to send her off on her journey Saturday, Anaim said, "My  mother and my father and, well, my family."  </P> <P> Asked why she is returning to Los Angeles, she said, "My husband is there."  </P> <P> Asked how she feels now that her nation of birth and her nation of residence  seem poised on the brink of hostilities, she shook her head.  </P> <P> "I cannot think about such things right now," she said as she dried her eyes  and hurried off to check in with embassy authorities.  </P> <P> "But it is sad. It is all just very, very sad."  </P></p>

Tsai] </F>   [Text] Taipei, Jan. 12 (CNA) -- India is considering  establishing a trade office in Taipei with a view to  strengthening cooperative ties with Taiwan, an Indian official  said here Wednesday [12 January].    Ashok Jha, director of the Asia-Pacific Department under  India's Ministry of Commerce, noted that his country is also  working to simplify visa procedures for Taiwan businessmen in  order to facilitate the exchange of visits between the two sides.    Jha, leading an eight-member Indian trade mission here,  arrived in Taipei Tuesday for a three-day visit.    India has relaxed a number of trade and investment  regulations since July 1991 under a government strategy to  promote market liberalization and internationalization, which  aims to court more foreign investors, he pointed out.    For example, he added, the tariff ceiling was lowered from  250 percent to the current 93 percent.    India has attracted more than US$4.1 billion in foreign  investment during the past two and a half years, he said, adding  the investors mainly came from the United States, Japan,  Britain, and Switzerland.    With a population of 886 million, which provides a high  purchasing power and low-cost labor force, India boasts great  potential for development, he stressed.    Moreover, he elaborated, Taiwan and India could enter into a  complementary relationship as foreign trade plays a leading role  in Taiwan's economic development and India's foreign trade  currently accounts for only 15 percent of its gross national  product.    Taiwan manufacturers are welcome to forge joint ventures  with  their Indian counterparts or make investments in India in such  industries as consumer products, auto parts, electronic  components, and food processing, he said.    To explore more trade opportunities here, Jha and his  mission  will meet with Taiwan manufacturers at the China External Trade  Development Council (Cetra) in the afternoon.    The Indian mission met with officials at the Ministry of  Foreign Affairs, the Board of Foreign Trade, and the Indian  Chamber of Commerce in Taipei in the morning.    Trade ties between Taipei and New Delhi have been growing.  Cetra, a semi-official foreign trade promotion organization in  Taiwan, opened an office in New Delhi last November. Two-way  trade totaled roughly US$500 million last year.</p>

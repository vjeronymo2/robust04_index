			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Dear listeners, due to the grave moments Rwanda  is going through, mainly characterized by insecurity in the  country particularly here in the capital, Kigali, and also  characterized by the obstinacy of the Rwandan Patriotic Front  [RPF], which has unilaterally decided to resume war, because of  all this, our colleague Jean-Francois Nsengiyumva approached  Colonel B.M. Gatsinzi, the interim chief of staff of the  national Armed Forces to ask him how the country's Armed Forces  and those in charge of security felt about all these issues.  [passage omitted]    [Nsengiyumva] Col. Gatsinzi, you are the interim chief of  staff since the tragic disappearance of titular chief of staff,  Deogratias Nsabimana, who disappeared in the accident, I mean,  the presidential jet that was shot down as it approached Kanombe  [airport]. [passage omitted]    Following this tragic disappearance, some elements of the  Presidential Guard and even other elements of the civilian  population who were angered by the disappearance indulged in  violence, sometimes unprecedented, which cost the lives of many  personalities of the country, including the prime minister,  Madame Agathe Uwilingiyimana. Therefore, I would like to ask  you what concrete actions you are taking, as the security  forces, to restore peace in the country and contain the  situation so that the population can once again live peacefully.    [Gatsinzi] [passage omitted] This tragic event afflicted and  saddened the entire Rwandan population including the Rwandan  Armed Forces. Unfortunately, there are some in the Army who  left their barracks and with anger, maybe seeking revenge,  killed some personalities and people. These people were not at  all sent by the command of the military authorities. (?These  are) (?people) who strayed, who spread left and right through  the town. But I would like to assure you that at the moment  this trend has been contained and the soldiers have been called  back and kept in their barracks.    The authorities have given instructions that peace must be  restored in the city center and in the surrounding areas of  Kigali, using elements that are usually charged with security,  the gendarmerie and the military police, to go and search for  those who strayed and bring them back to their barracks and to  stop these activities. I can assure you that the situation is  currently returning to normal. We continue to do everything  possible to restore peace and calm. But unfortunately there are  some other people, bandits, who have taken advantage of the  (?uprising) and interfered in the problems by looting and  massacring the population, sometimes for the sake of settling  scores. [sentence indistinct].    Now, measures have been taken and are being implemented for  the gradual restoration of peace in the country. This is the  number one concern of the Crisis Committee, to see the return of  peace and for the political authorities to recoup the leadership  of the state, to give all instructions as befits their power for  the return of peace and the resumption of normal life so that  the government can function.    We have helped to facilitate government members, who were  scattered left and right, (?to meet) so that they alone can  decide on the future of the country. The Army has not  interfered in any way. We have just facilitated their meetings  and contacts. And all the decisions were taken by the  government, and the establishment of the latter is the  prerogative of the political authorities. The Army has not  interfered in that.    [Nsengiyumva] Colonel, alongside this regrettable situation  of insecurity, we have learned that the RPF-Inkotanyi decided  two days ago, I think, to resume war instead of helping the  Rwandan Government, its new partner. According to the terms of  the Arusha Accord, it is the Rwandan Government that is the  other signatory, so instead of helping this partner to restore  peace in the country, the RPF has unilaterally decided to resume  hostilities. For your part, are you ready to face these [words  indistinct] attacks in order to reassure the population?    [Gatsinzi] It is very regrettable that the RPF has resumed  hostilities by leaving the premises of the National Development  Council, where it was staying, and attacking the military  barracks of Kimihurura [in Kigali] whose soldiers carried out  massacres on the population. As I have said, it was not all the  soldiers, but just some of them--in fact, maybe people disguised  as soldiers. Investigations have been launched, and these will  establish the truth. But it is very regrettable that the RPF  has taken up arms and resumed hostilities.    But as it is the duty of the Rwandan Armed Forces to protect  the population, the security forces and the Rwandan Armed Forces  in particular have contained the attacks of the RPF, which  indeed, are [word indistinct] on the entire northern front  [words indistinct]. At the same time, we were trying to help  the establishment of the government so that it could continue  contacts and negotiations with the RPF within the framework of  implementing the peace accords, despite the recent  disappearances, to avoid having a political vacuum.    The Rwandan Armed Forces urgently call upon the RPF partners  to use their goodwill to restore the climate of peace and  negotiations, and not to favor war, for one cannot trust war as  a solution, since it can be (?fatal).</p>

			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / International Capital Markets: Rautaruukki to raise FM320m with share issue RAUTARUUKKI, Finland's largest steelmaker, is raising FM320m through a share issue that will strengthen its balance sheet and reduce the Finnish government's stake from 86.8 per cent to 81.1 per cent. The offering is an important step in Finland's programme to widen ownership of state-owned companies, as it is the first time that the state has reduced its stake in a company by selling part of its rights in an issue. The issue is also a dry run for further potential share sales at Rautaruukki. The Finnish government sent a bill to parliament last month which, if approved, would allow it to reduce its stake in the company to just over 50 per cent. Rautaruukki, founded in 1960, has grown to become one of the two biggest flat steel product companies in Finland and Scandinavia, along with SSAB of Sweden. It also makes tubes and sections. The company, which employs 9,000, was hit badly by the steel industry recession in 1991 and 1992, with total losses after financing items of more than FM1.5bn. But Mr Mikko Kivimaki, chief executive, said the timing was right for the issue. Speaking in London, he said the company had made big improvements in productivity and delivery times, and its performance would improve considerably this year. The issue also takes advantage of better stock market conditions in Finland and the boost to Rautaruukki's export competitiveness because of the markka's devaluation. Finland will invest FM150m in the issue, but 5.8m of the 14.5m new shares will be sold to the public. Postipankki, the Finnish bank, is lead-managing the issue, and Merrill Lynch is co-lead manager responsible for organising the international placement. The third placement agent is Opstock of Finland. There is no limit on the amount of shares which can be sold internationally. The issue is expected to be priced at FM22 a share, compared with a market price of FM42 for the shares already traded publicly.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 10 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-Premier  Zhu Rongji held talks with Brian Howe, Australian deputy prime  minister and minister for housing and regional development, on  Sino- Australian relations, bilateral trade as well as issues  concerning urban construction.    Zhu said that Sino-Australian friendly cooperative relations  have enjoyed satisfactory development in recent years, with  frequent exchanges of high-level visits between the two  countries, large- scale increasement [word as received] in  bilateral trade and continuous expansion of economic and  technological cooperation.    The current visit by Howe is an another major event in  bilateral relations, which will be significant for the mutually  beneficial cooperation between the two countries, Zhu said.    China has adopted a series of important reform measures in  taxation, finance, investment and foreign trade system and  achieved positive results, Zhu said, adding that these have  injected new power in developing Sino-Australian trade, economic  and technological cooperation.    China is conducting reforms in its urban construction and it  needs to learn advanced technology and experience from other  countries, Zhu said, adding that China is willing to exchange  experience and cooperate with Australia in this regard.    Howe said that China's high-speed economic development has  attracted world's attention, and that Australia attaches great  importance to developing friendly cooperation with China.    He said that Australia supports China's resumption of its  status as GATT's signatory state and would like to work with  China to this end.    Howe said the economies of China and Australia are mutually  complementary and conducting bilateral cooperation is in line  with the interests of both countries.    Australia and China should be cooperation partners and  should  explore new ways and fields for bilateral cooperation, said Howe.    The Australian visitors arrived here this afternoon at the  invitation of the Chinese Government. Chen Jinhua, Chinese  minister in charge of the State Planning Commission, met with  Howe this afternoon.</p>

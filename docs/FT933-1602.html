			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / Hopes of housing upturn boosted HOPES FOR an upturn in the housing market this autumn were boosted yesterday when the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors reported stronger than normal market activity in August, a traditionally quiet month. Its survey of members in England and Wales for the three months to the end of August found that chartered surveyor estate agents were confident that autumn sales would be encouraging. However, Mr Peter Miller, the institution's housing spokesman, said the enthusiasm was 'tempered by false dawns in the past'. Mr Miller added: 'As buyer confidence returns, activity ebbs and flows but the tide continues to rise.' The institution's survey - based on reports from across England and Wales - found variations in the state of the market in different part of the country. In northern England sales and viewings increased in many areas, but with few signs of price rises. Local factors were behind price increases. The institution said that in Middlesbrough, demand was highest at the bottom of the housing ladder as buyers found they could afford repossessed and vacant properties. Surveyors in south-east England reported an improvement in sales and confidence. An exception was Epsom, Surrey, where August was said to be the quietest for several years. One estate agent said the month in Epsom ended with a few new instructions and many more valuations, but added: 'The market still very much needs a boost really to waken it - perhaps the promised interest rate drop will actually happen and help.' The picture in East Anglia was mixed. London was busy in August, with a lack of new properties coming on the market. Vendors held back in the expectation that prices would rise.</p>

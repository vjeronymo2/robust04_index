			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / UK Company News: Excalibur gets bid approach Excalibur, the jewellery and engineering group, has received an approach which 'may or may not lead to an offer being made for the company'. The group's shares have risen from a low of 8 1/2 p this year to 17 1/2 p, up 2p yesterday. The rise prompted the announcement. The group said it could make no further comment. The identity of the possible bidder was not disclosed. In January it announced an interim loss of Pounds 183,000 as its jewellery business was hit by problems in the retail trade. It halved its interim dividend. A number of investors have come into the group recently. Three directors bought 2.8m shares last September at 8p each, taking their holdings to nearly 13 per cent. And Suter, Mr David Abell's mini-conglomerate, recently bought a 6 per cent stake.</p>

			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / Unions demand more staff at Customs Civil service unions repres-enting Customs and Excise officers called on the government yesterday to hire an extra 3,000 staff to help combat drug imports and recover an estimated Pounds 1.7bn in lost revenue for the Treasury from the non-payment of value added tax. Contrasting the widely publicised government crackdown on alleged social security fraud with the lack of similar action on VAT evasion, Mr Geoff Lewtas, Customs and Excise secretary for the CPSA clerical union, accused ministers of applying double standards. The civil service unions estimate that every VAT inspector costs about Pounds 25,000 a year to employ, but raises Pounds 360,000 a year in additional tax. 'Their level of productivity has increased consistently over the years at a rate of 25 per cent annually, well above the increase in salaries,' the unions argue. They calculate that if an extra 1,700 VAT inspectors were employed it would produce more than Pounds 1bn in additional VAT revenue collected for the Treasury. The unions point out that Customs have made a 40 per cent cut in VAT inspections since 1990 and cut 600 staff. Their demand would mean a rise of 30 per cent in current staff levels. The unions also want an increase of 1,000 in the number of staff trying to prevent the import of dangerous drugs into Britain and bootlegging. They claim that a more rigorous clampdown on smuggled alcohol and cigarettes would lead to a Pounds 500m improvement in lost revenue with an extra Pounds 250m from the loss in revenue from legal cross-border shopping. The Customs and Excise Department said it could not comment on the union claims. It added that competitive tendering had succeeded in making cost savings in catering and printing.</p>

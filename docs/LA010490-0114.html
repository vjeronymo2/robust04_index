			<p><P> January 4, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUNTY PROPOSES 25-YEAR PLAN TO SAVE WATER;  </P> <P> RESOURCES: TO KEEP SEAWATER FROM SEEPING INTO WELLS, OFFICIALS ARE PROPOSING A  STRICT RATIONING PLAN. GROWERS AND TOWNS WILL BE AFFECTED.  </P> <P> Ventura County water officials are proposing a strict 25-year plan to ration  the quantity of water that growers and cities pump from underground pools of  water deep below the Oxnard Plain.  </P> <P> Officials are also considering an emergency ordinance to at least temporarily  ban the drilling of new  </P> <P> wells on the plain, the agriculturally rich expanse stretching from the beaches  of Oxnard through the valleys of Camarillo.  </P> <P> The initial reaction from growers this week is that the water rationing  proposals will be an economic hardship, but that they are necessary for the  long-range preservation of farm areas.  </P> <P> The rationing plan, which requires users to cut consumption 5% by 1995 and 25%  by 2015, comes with penalties for exceeding water allotments. But some area  growers, faced with decisions based on economics, may opt to keep on pumping  and pay the fines.  </P> <P> The proposed fines would range from $50 to $200 for every acre-foot of water  used by growers in excess of their regular allotments.  </P> <P> "We need a certain quantity of water to grow our crops, and without that, our  crops will suffer," said David Pommer, ranch manager at the 900-acre Utt  Development citrus ranch in Oxnard. His operation, an old-style ranch that  irrigates with furrows, could save water by converting to mini-sprinklers, he  said. But that can be expensive, at an estimated cost of $1,200 per acre.  </P> <P> "If you're planning on growing for 30 years, it might pay for itself," Pommer  said. "But we're in an area that will be real estate in 20 years."  </P> <P> The proposed ordinances, to be considered at a public meeting on Jan. 26, come  after preliminary results in December showed a second finding of seawater  intrusion into the lower aquifer system. That system, and the deep Fox Canyon  Aquifer in particular, was previously believed to be uncontaminated despite  decades of overdrafting, when growers pumped more water out than was  replenished through rainfall.  </P> <P> Since the 1920s, seawater has crept into shallow aquifers, making parts of them  unsuitable for grower or municipal use. Users consequently drilled deeper  wells, tapping the lower system and contributing to the overdraft and the  seawater intrusion.  </P> <P> For the first time, tests in November showed strong evidence of seawater  encroachment in the lower system. The county is still waiting for final test  results from the U.S. Geological Survey, which drilled the wells and performed  the tests.  </P> <P> The Fox Canyon Groundwater Management Agency, the public body that regulates  ground water usage on the Oxnard Plain, plans a public hearing on the pumping  restriction ordinance at the Jan. 26 meeting to solicit comment from users.  </P> <P> But the need for the proposed emergency ordinance to prohibit drilling new  wells may be temporarily relieved, said Lynn Maulhardt, president of United  Water Conservation District and chairman of the Groundwater Mangement Agency.  The emergency ordinance was thought necessary when developers of a golf course  in western Camarillo asked permission to drill two wells that would draw 500  acre feet per year.  </P> <P> "The immediate question was whether a golf course is a good use of ground water  in an overdrafted basin," Maulhardt said. He proposed the emergency ban to give  board members time to study the issue in depth, he said. But developer Spanish  Hills, has verbally withdrawn its request and will instead seek water from the  city of Camarillo, which plans to annex the property, said John Turner,  hydrologist with the county's Water Resourses Department.  </P> <P> However, other board members may still want the ban in place to avert future  requests before the board can decide on a permanent course of action, Maulhardt  said.  </P> <P> The proposed pumping restriction ordinance is designed to reach safe yield by  2025, that point at which the water draining into aquifers is equal to or more  than the quantity being extracted.  </P> <P> It will set allocations and reduction requirements by averaging five-year  water-use records, Turner said. Using information from the meters, which are  required on all large-quantity pumps, users must report their water use twice a  year to United Water District. The district has staff that monitors the meters  and usage reports, checking them against the acreage farmed and crops grown to  ensure the numbers correspond appropriately, Maulhardt said.  </P> <P> After earlier drafts of the ordinance were distributed, some growers complained  that those who are now the most conscientious with water use would be the  hardest hit. A provision was added to assign credits for growers who are  already using water at top efficiency.  </P> <P> Because there are only about 800 pumpers, most of whom are large operators  including both growers and municipalities such as Oxnard, Ventura, Port Hueneme  and Camarillo, cheating in reporting should not be a serious problem, Maulhardt  said.  </P> <P> "But I'm not going to be naive enough to believe that this is not a potential  problem," he said. Still, he believes United's staff and the threat of the  fines to be imposed on those caught reporting wrong figures will deter the  majority from manipulating figures.  </P> <P> Growers' options for complying with the reduction ordinance include converting  antiquated irrigation systems to modern, more water-efficient methods, or  reducing their irrigated acreage. If the market were favorable, they could even  change their crops from row crops, which are relatively high water users, to  tree crops, which use less water. They can also continue to use the excess  water, and accept penalties.  </P> <P> "We also hope that over the next 25 years more technology will be available,"  Maulhardt said. "Who knows, maybe we'll figure out a way to use the ocean to  water crops."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, according to one Oxnard grower, some farmers may react to the plan  by eliminating low-value crops that use relatively high levels of water.  </P> <P> Craig Underwood, partner of the Underwood Ranches of Oxnard, suggested that  crops which might be eliminated would include broccoli or lima beans, while  strawberries would not be as threatened because of their steady market value.  </P> <P> Oxnard Plain farmer Tom McGrath said he believes the reductions will be  difficult for growers, but said he thinks water conservation is essential to  the future of farming in the county.  </P> <P> "It's the way the industry has to go," he said.  </P> <P> WATER SHORTAGE  </P> <P> County got little relief from this week's showers.  </P></p>

			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / Profitable Rolls-Royce cuts costs and lifts market share Rolls-Royce, the UK aero-engine and industrial power group, yesterday returned to the black after making strong progress in its restructuring programme and increasing its share of the world civil aircraft engine market. Pre-tax profits totalled Pounds 76m last year, against a loss of Pounds 184m in 1992 after exceptional charges of Pounds 268m. Sir Ralph Robins, chairman, said the group had managed to make 'substantial progress' with its restructuring. 'At the same time, we have improved our share of world markets, particularly in the civil aviation sector,' he added. The restructuring led to 6,000 job cuts including 3,600 in the company's aerospace activities and 2,400 in the industrial power business. The workforce is expected to fall by 3,600 this year to 42,200. The company closed three plants and will close a further three in 1994 to match the cost-cutting of its two bigger US aero-engine rivals, General Electric and Pratt &amp; Whitney, and the decline in defence business. Although sales fell 1 per cent to Pounds 3.52bn and company funded research and development spending rose by 10 per cent to Pounds 253m, operating profits were marginally higher at Pounds 329m reflecting benefits of the cost-cutting programme and the favourable dollar exchange rate. The company continued to have a strong order backlog of Pounds 6.2bn. This did not include an additional Pounds 937m worth of orders announced but not yet signed, said Mr Terry Harrison, chief executive. Despite difficult market conditions, Rolls-Royce said it had increased its market share to 25 per cent of new commercial engine orders last year compared with 22 per cent in 1992. Profits before interest and exceptional charges in the company's aero-engine division rose to Pounds 20m last year from Pounds 17m on a small decline in sales to Pounds 2.14bn from Pounds 2.143bn. In the industrial power sector, profits fell to Pounds 68m from Pounds 85m with sales declining to Pounds 1.38bn from Pounds 1.41bn. The company reported a significant improvement in its positive net cash position totalling Pounds 473m last year compared with Pounds 84m a year earlier. This included a cash inflow of Pounds 82m in addition to the Pounds 307m proceeds from last year's rights issue. As expected, the dividend was maintained at 5p per share. Earnings per share were 5.95p, up from a loss of 20.39p. Lex, Page 18</p>

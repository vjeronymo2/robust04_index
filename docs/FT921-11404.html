			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Insurer to end NHL home-loan cover ABOUT 22,000 mortgage customers of National Home Loans, the troubled lending group, have been told by Sun Alliance that their payment protection insurance scheme is to be halted from the end of next month, David Barchard and Richard Lapper write. Sun Alliance took over the scheme from Security Pacific, the US banking group, in August. The decision to end it was taken because the account had proved 'unprofitable'. Sun Alliance is not withdrawing from payment protection business in general. NHL said it expects to sign a new payment protection insurance scheme with an insurer next week. The scheme will be slightly more expensive for NHL customers. About 750 NHL mortgagees are claiming on their payment protection policies from Sun Alliance. Their claims will not be affected.</p>

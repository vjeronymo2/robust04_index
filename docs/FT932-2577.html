			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / US business confidence down April-June US business confidence dropped 20 per cent between April and June to its lowest level since the recession of 1990-91, the US Chamber of Commerce said yesterday. It attributed the decline to growing economic pessimism caused mainly by the prospect of higher taxes to pay for deficit reduction and healthcare reform. The index, which is based on a survey of 11,000 mostly small companies, stands at 47.7 against a recent high of 62.4 shortly after Mr Clinton's election victory.</p>

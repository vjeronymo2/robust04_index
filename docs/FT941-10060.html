			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / First solicitor in court as advocate The Bar's 200-year monopoly on advocacy in the higher courts formally came to an end yesterday when Mr Richard Slowe, a former barrister, became the first solicitor to exercise advocacy rights in the High Court. He appeared before Mr Justice Ferris in the Chancery Division of the High Court as junior in a business expansion scheme case. He was one of 32 solicitors whose applications for exemption from the requirement to take an advocacy course before gaining higher court advocacy rights was granted by the society yesterday. The profession got the go-ahead for the change from Lord Mackay, the Lord Chancellor, and the four senior judges last December.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Mikhail Shchipanov: "Democracy, the State, and </F> the People: Will the Kremlin Create a New State Ideology"]    [Text] The epigraph to the stormy, rally-filled years of  perestroyka frenzy are the biblical lines that some  silver-tongued journalist took a fancy to about the Prophet  Moses, who for 40 years led his brother Hebrews through the  desert. At that time, the parable was interpreted absolutely  unequivocally: During 40 years of wandering in the sands, the  last Hebrew born in Egyptian bondage was to give his soul back  to God. So also over the decades we were directed to squeeze  "homo sovieticus," or simply "sovok" (Soviet man) out of  ourselves drop by drop, destroying everything old that was  keenly reminiscent of the long spiritual bondage.    Some ill-natured minds, of course, preferred the  interpretation of Moses' wanderings given by A. Dulles, the  first American intelligence officer. According to the CIA man,  it turned out that after 40 years of swallowing sand, it was not  so much the former slaves who were supposed to die out as much  as the untalented Hebrew chiefs who dared to place in doubt even  the recommendations of the Lord God. But this kind of  interpretation already personified the blame too much for the  well-known failure, to which an end has not been put to this  day, instead of spreading it on the sorrowful plate of our  "irresponsible and ignorant" people. And here another biblical  wisdom came in time. That which advises to begin "gathering  stones" after a rout. The time, it is said, has come. Well,  then, is this the end of crossing the desert? Proletarians,  remaining kolkhozniks, emerging farmers, eternally dissatisfied  intellectuals, and devouring new bourgeois, unite! But what is  the question about? Is it really about the paschal table? Thus,  the question of creating a new state ideology of Russia has  assumed considerable significance.    In fact, there was talk about an ideological vacuum a year  to  a year and a half ago, when a happy toast addressed to brother  Balts "To your freedom and ours!" unexpectedly turned into a  bitter and humiliating hangover for millions of Russians, who by  the will of fate ended up outside the borders of Mother Russia.  But the delayed attempts at least verbally to protect emigrants  willy-nilly (even with references to the rich "democratic"  American experience in this regard) ran into a torrent of  accusations of imperial ambitions, although after the crash of  the indestructible Union, Russia by definition could not become  an empire.    Oil was also poured onto the fire by the continuous  discussions about the impending collapse of Russia itself, which  was doomed, it was said, to repeat the Union's road to Calvary.  The best minds even warned against early elections which, it was  said, the former autonomies would repudiate after sanctioning  the de facto decay of the great Russian body. As if it were  possible to put off the elections indefinitely, at the same time  preserving the appearance of representative democracy. They  cannot be avoided...    Just what happened recently that served as a catalyst of the  process of fermentation in the Kremlin think tank? As a classic  would write it, here is what happened during this time: Winter  came. The winter of the introduction of a new state  constitution, parliamentary elections, with their reassessment  of many values that had become usual for a couple of years, and  a noticeable distancing of the president from former historical  allies (it is another matter that history itself is moving). The  breakthrough of "the master in all languages," V.V.Zh., once  again demonstrated that a state not protected by its own  pragmatic ideology is in fact defenseless against the virus of  radicalism and ultrainfections. But phrases of the type "we are  not promising miracles" are not at all suitable for the state  banner.    A natural need has arisen to define the role of the Russian  state more clearly, without restricting oneself to the abstract  slogan "Less State," and its duty to the citizens and  responsibility for the future of the nation, that is to say, to  put together a complete state structure from the traditional  blocks. And, apparently, it is at this stage that the  split occurred, which far more logically than arguments on the  new residence of parliament explain the hasty departure of  Gaydar into the domain of the Duma.    It seems that two concepts have collided, neither of which  is  without genetic defects. However, here is more detail about  everything...    The supporters of the new state ideology (conditionally  speaking, a "Kremlin" ideology) prefer to call it centrist. The  plan of the state structure is a Russia that is united and  indivisible. In economics--restoration of the traditional  elements of "controllability" that reinforce the role of state  regulation. In policy--intensification of authoritarian trends  combined with charitable trends on the scale of Russia (read the  new constitution). In the sphere of relations with CIS  countries--a period of "collection" that is expressed in a  strengthening of the attachment of the former Soviet republics  to Russia. Monetary union with Belarus--the first but important  step. In international policy--something in the nature of the  French "quiet strength," ensuring Russian influence and respect  for its interests in areas of traditional Russian influence, in  the final analysis also sanctioned by the world community. The  symbols of this kind of approach are both continuation of the  construction of the super-cruiser Peter the Great and the recent  announcements of Andrey Kozyrev. And, naturally, the idea of the  creation of a presidential party contemplated, apparently, for a  "long" rule even under conditions of a permanent election game.  Something like the Italian Christian-Democrats or the Japanese  Liberal Democrats. Naturally, their epochs comprise many years  of prosperity.    Many first persons of the state who are not noted, as they  say, for extremism will embody the new concept--V. Shumeyko, V.  Chernomyrdin, O. Soskovets, evidently A. Kozyrev, many prominent  presidential advisers...and, in the final analysis, the  president himself. Other figures who until recently were  considered filed away in the political archives are also  possible. It is not for nothing that the names Abalkin and  Shcherbakov, former minister of finance of the Union, which were  partially forgotten for the last year and a half, surfaced once  again in the last few days.    Of course, the traditional reliance on strengthening the  state comes into direct conflict with a number of already  implanted liberal principles, but in the new context liberalism  in the economy, evidently, will be preferable to political  liberalism. It is not accidental that a high-standing Russian  delegation headed by Minister Kozyrev is studying the experience  of free economic zones in China this very week, a system that  Gaydar apriori considered unacceptable for the new Russia.    But this is one point of view. Another was expressed once  again last Saturday by Yegor Gaydar, who stressed his adherence  to the idea of an inexpensive state apparatus with a limited  sphere of interference, patterning of foreign policy based on  Russia's real capabilities (live within one's means), and  guaranteeing the interests of the citizens. Gaydar's program is  also logical in its way, but it is, perhaps, the same as when  abstract logic runs up against state traditions and the national  mentality. It is more likely that Gaydar' model would be  suitable for Norway in an ideal way. Meanwhile, the de facto  elimination of Russia's status as a world power threatens it  with quite specific economic losses, not to mention the loss of  many strategically important markets, including the armaments  market as well. It is known that frequently arms are acquired  from the country whose influence and support are counted on. And  this is only one aspect of the problem.    In a word, there are no ideal ideological systems.  Especially  in the changing conditions of the breakup. But it is obvious  that Gaydar's departure is not a consequence of a private  quarrel concerning monetary union with Belarus. And it is  strange that the leader of Russia's Choice still only indirectly  hints at his deepening differences with the Kremlin.  Nonetheless, it will all come out in the open.    What is most difficult of all, of course, is to determine  unequivocally those who are right and those who are to blame in  the emerging dispute on ways of ideologically forming the  Russian state. The more so because not only did Zhirinovskiy  succeed in the elections but it would seem that the classic  statesmen from the Civic Union suffered defeat. Not one of the  disputing sides can now manifestly refer to the voice of the  people, who are far more concerned about prosaic and everyday  problems. With the exception, perhaps, of the defense of their  own national dignity. It is the lever that they use more and  more frequently. It is clear, for example, that the Philippine  authorities could not permit the arrest of two American generals  even for the sake of forcing the departure of the military  Yankees, as was recently done in Latvia with our generals. And  any government will have to react equally to such challenges.  Even the most incurable liberals.    A year to a year and a half remain to make adjustments in  emphasis, but the favorite at the next presidential elections  will be precisely the bearer of a state ideology. Not so much  one who is blatant like V.V.Zh., but one who inspires respect  for the average Russian citizen. Especially in the provinces.  Will this be Yeltsin himself?</p>

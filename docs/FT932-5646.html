			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / Drop in cash growth raises fears for economic recovery A SHARP DROP in the growth of cash in circulation last month has added to doubts about the strength of UK economic recovery and raised expectations for another cut in interest rates. Bank of England figures yesterday showed that M0, the narrow measure of the money supply - mainly notes and coins in circulation - grew a seasonally adjusted 3.3 per cent in the year to May, compared with growth of 4.8 per cent in the year to April. The slowdown in the annual rate of growth pointed towards a weakening in consumer spending and a slow and patchy recovery for the UK. The pound continued to weaken against the D-Mark on the foreign exchanges, as the market took the view that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the new chancellor, would cut interest rates. Sterling closed at DM2.4625, down  3/4 of a pfennig on the day. It closed 1 cent down against the dollar at Dollars 1.541 - its closing figure in New York. The UK stock market was also buoyed by speculation of another easing in monetary policy. The FT-SE 100 Index of leading industrial shares closed at 2,863, up 13.8 points on the day. Compared with April, M0 fell by 1.1 per cent, the sharpest monthly fall for over 10 years. The fall took the annual growth rate of M0 back within the government's monitor range of 0-4 per cent for the first time since January. The provisional figures were the latest in a string of indicators pointing towards a bumpy UK recovery. As a fairly good indicator of the pace of consumer spending, the latest drop in M0 suggests there was some weakening in retail activity in May after strong first quarter growth. 'It is very clear taking the April and May figures together that the trend in M0 is now downwards,' said Mr Simon Briscoe, UK economist at Midland Global Markets. The drop in M0 in May was exaggerated by low bank operational deposits - accounts held by commercial banks for clearing purposes at the Bank of England. However, these account for only 1 per cent of total M0. Last month's figure was depressed by an upward blip to M0 recorded in May last year. It may have been affected by the two bank holidays in May, when traditionally spending patterns alter. The Bank of England also released final money supply figures for April. These confirmed that growth in broad money has remained depressed in recent months. In the year to April M4 - M0 plus bank deposits -  1/2 grew a seasonally adjusted 3.5 per cent, compared with 3.6 per cent in the year to March.

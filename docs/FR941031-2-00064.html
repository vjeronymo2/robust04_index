Applicant proposes to conduct these activities throughout the United States and the world. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act provides that a bank holding company may, with Board approval, engage in any activity that the Board, after due notice and opportunity for hearing, has determined by order or regulation to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. This statutory test requires that two separate tests be met for an activity to be permissible for a bank holding company. First, the Board must determine that the activity is, as a general matter, closely related to banking. Second, the Board must find in a particular case that the performance of the activity by the applicant bank holding company may reasonably be expected to produce public benefits that outweigh possible adverse effects. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A particular activity may be found to meet the ``closely related to banking'' test if it is demonstrated that banks generally have provided the proposed activity, that banks generally provide services that are so operationally or functionally similar to the proposed activity as to equip them particularly well to engage in the proposed activity, or that banks generally provide services that are so integrally related to the proposed activity as to require their provision in a specialized form.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> National Courier Ass'n v. Board of Governors <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 516 F.2d 1229, 1237 (D.C. Cir. 1975). In addition, the Board may consider any other basis that may demonstrate that the activity has a reasonable or close relationship to banking or managing or controlling banks. Board Statement Regarding Regulation Y, 49 FR 806 (1984). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Banco Santander states that the Board previously has determined by regulation that some of the proposed activities, when conducted within limitations established by the Board, are closely related to banking for purposes of section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  12 CFR 225.25(b)(1) (making and servicing loans); 12 CFR 225.25 (b)(15) (full-service brokerage services); 12 CFR 225.25(b)(16) (underwriting and dealing in bank-eligible securities). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Banco Santander also states that the Board has determined by order that the remaining proposed activities, when conducted within limitations established by the Board in previous orders, are closely related to banking.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 76 Federal Reserve Bulletin 158 (1990),  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> J.P.

For this reason, Banco Santander contends that approval of the application would not be barred by section 20 of the Glass-Steagall Act (12 U.S.C. 377), which prohibits the affiliation of a state member bank with any company principally engaged in the underwriting, public sale, or distribution of securities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to approve the proposal, the Board must determine that the proposed activities ``can reasonably be expected to produce benefits to the public, such as greater convenience, increased competition, or gains in efficiency, that outweigh possible adverse effects, such as undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interests, or unsound banking practices.'' 12 U.S.C.  1843(c)(8). Banco Santander states that the proposal will produce public benefits that outweigh any potential adverse effects. In particular, Banco Santander maintains that the proposal will enhance competition and enable it to offer its customers a broader range of products. In addition, Banco Santander states that the proposed activities will not result in adverse effects such as an undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interest, or unsound banking practices. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In publishing the proposal for comment, the Board does not take a position on issues raised by the proposal. Notice of the proposal is published solely to seek the views of interested persons on the issues presented by the application and does not represent a determination by the Board that the proposal meets, or is likely to meet, the standards of the BHC Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any comments or requests for hearing should be submitted in writing to William W. Wiles, Secretary, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Washington, D.C. 20551, not later than November 15, 1994. Any request for a hearing on this application must, as required by  262.3(e) of the Board's Rules of Procedure (12 CFR 262.3(e)), be accompanied by a statement of reasons why a written presentation would not suffice in lieu of a hearing, identifying specifically any questions of fact that are in dispute, summarizing the evidence that would be presented at a hearing, and indicating how the party commenting would be aggrieved by approval of the proposal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This application may be inspected at the offices of the Board of Governors or the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, October 25, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Jennifer J.

			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / Brand 'look-alikes' under threat Brand manufacturers have warned that they will reconsider UK investment plans unless curbs are put on supermarkets' own label 'look-alike' products. The manufacturers are angry at a government decision not to amend the trademarks bill to restrict the use of 'look-alikes'. The warning was given by Coca Cola and members of the British Producers and Brand Owners Group. Ministers say it is too late to amend the bill, which was recently given a second reading in the Commons. Report, Page 9</p>

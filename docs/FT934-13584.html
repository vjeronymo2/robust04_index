			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Cash in circulation rises again FURTHER SIGNS that consumers are the driving force behind the recovery were contained in yesterday's money supply figures. They showed continued strong growth by cash in circulation. Last month, M0 - mainly notes and coins - grew by a seasonally adjusted 0.3 per cent on the previous month to give growth of 5.3 per cent in the year to September, the strongest increase for more than three years. Bank lending figures pointed to the underlying fragility of the recovery, however, with growth in lending skewed strongly towards mortgages rather than the corporate sector, which is still giving priority to debt repayment. M0, or narrow money, which has tended to rise in line with retail sales growth, has increased for four consecutive months and is now growing at its fastest rate since July 1990. For seven out of the past eight months it has been above the government's 0 per cent to 4 per cent monitoring range. Broad money - M0 plus bank and building society deposits - also grew, by a seasonally adjusted 0.2 per cent on the month and 3.9 per cent compared with a year before. That compared with growth of 3.6 per cent in the year to August. Bank and building society lending - M4 lending - was up a seasonally adjusted Pounds 2bn in September compared with a revised increase of Pounds 2.4bn in August. A breakdown of the figures shows that growth in new lending occurred mainly in the personal sector with strong demand for mortgages standing in contrast to the company sector's determination to repay bank debts. Figures from the British Bankers' Association emphasise this picture, showing that lending by the nine main high street banks fell in September with repayments by companies more than offsetting a Pounds 954m increase in lending to individuals. Total lending by the big retail banks fell by a seasonally adjusted Pounds 94m in September compared with an August rise of Pounds 1.6bn and the recent average monthly rise of Pounds 1.1bn per month. Lord Inchyra, director-general of the BBA, said: 'September's small fall emphasises the weakness in the recovery of lending which the banks had been experiencing over the last few months.' Mortgage lending in September rose by Pounds 951m following a rise of Pounds 800m in August. This was the strongest rise for more than two years and compares with a rise in mortgage lending of only Pounds 381m in September last year. There were large repayments by securities dealers, property companies and construction companies. The only significant increases were in lending to food, drink and tobacco companies.</p>

			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Survey of Relocation in The UK (17): Big change of culture for a family business - A long-established company moves from central Manchester to mid Wales INSIDE the main door of William O'Hanlon's new plant in Newtown, mid Wales, is a plaque recording the names of all those employees who have spent more than 50 years with the company. There are 42 of them, including three members of the founding O'Hanlon family. Two more names could soon be added. One employee will join the select band later this year - and the present chairman, Mr Esmond O'Hanlon, great grandson of the founder, has just three years to make his half century. A move from its only home for a private, family concern such as O'Hanlon was therefore taken with some trepidation. The company had been in the centre of Manchester since its inception in 1870; the only move it had previously undertaken being no further than crossing Dale Street. Would its employees come with it to mid Wales, the directors wondered. O'Hanlon's problem was that its Victorian six-storey building was no longer suitable for its business, making roller blinds, curtain fabrics and made-up curtains for the small retailer. The factory was, in effect, a series of small, inter-linking rooms in which the various compartments of the business could be carried on. 'It was a wasteful method of organisation,' says Mr Andrew Hoyle, the young managing director who joined the company six years ago. 'In its time, the arrangement was suitable. In bad times some of the rooms could be shut down as the company retracted and let off to bring in income. In good times, we could expand carefully. 'But the building was wasteful in modern terms since it meant we had to employ people doing largely the same sort of work in different rooms. A move made sense, especially as we wanted to develop our export business.' There was, however, also the 112 staff to be considered. O'Hanlon set great store by good employees relations. The O'Hanlons had been prominent in helping Manchester's problems and it did not want to abandon anyone, especially in the economic climate last year. In the event, 34 decided to make the move and only two of those have returned - 'even those two were not unexpected,' Mr Hoyle says, 'because they were in two minds about coming.' Every member of the staff who took up the offer to visit Newtown opted to move with the company. Offset against the two are four who have subsequently rejoined the company after initially deciding to stay in Manchester. The shape of the building was only one reason O'Hanlon looked elsewhere. Labour problems in inner Manchester made it difficult to recruit and keep staff. Newtown posed no such problems. There is no serious unemployment in the town and it had an added attraction to O'Hanlon: it has several Laura Ashley plants. A supply of trained labour accustomed to working in the textile industry was on tap. 'Laura Ashley has been going through problems over the past year,' Mr Hoyle says, 'and our arrival was a good reason for many of its workers to see if they could switch. Although we only wanted 14 people for the start-up date, we got 164 applicants, most of them qualified people. And we now have people working with us for less than they received at Laura Ashley.' The company looked at several sites before it settled on Newtown. The first area was within distance of Manchester, to try and retain its roots. Preston, Runcorn and Wigan were all considered, but it was felt these towns, which had all developed over the past 20-25 years, had gone through their early expansion phase whereas Newtown was still to reach its potential. Responsibility for the move was given to the finance director. He first contacted the inner-core of managers to alert them to the company's thinking and when the decision had been made, each of the three executive directors talked individually to every member of the staff. A relocation package was drawn up for those thinking of moving and an alternative package, involving bringing forward pensions as well as enhancing redundancy pay, was created for those who were to leave the company. 'O'Hanlon has always been a good company to work for,' Mr Hoyle says, 'and the O'Hanlon family has always played an important part in the social life of Manchester. They were particularly interested in schooling and care of children. So we were not going to leave Manchester without making every provision possible for all our employees. 'We would have liked everyone to come with us and I am sorry more did not take up our offer because it was a tremendous opportunity for them. But people have different family, work and other claims and I understand their decision.' The company did not employ specialists on employee relocation, but the finance director spoke to several of his friends who had been through a similar experience. In the event, everyone who said he or she was interested in the move actually went south with the company, even some with over 25 years service. Mr Hoyle believes the move has been a success though the 34, as well as the company itself, have had to come to terms with a new culture, especially concerning the environment. Newtown is as crime-free as it is possible to get, so the staff are relaxed about going out at night. But it is a country area and two-car families are the norm. Social life is different: better for the families who have tended to mix more together, but worse for the bachelors who miss Manchester's night life. Mr Hoyle believes the move has been a success, but he will not really know until a report commissioned from an independent consultant has been received. The report should have been in his hands by now but the consultant relocated himself to the north of Scotland. Mr Hoyle's regrets are not about the move, but that once the next two names of those serving for 50 years are on the plaque there will be no one to follow them. Given that an entrant joins at 16 and serves to retirement at 65, it is no longer possible to get 50 years in with a single employer. He also regrets, too, that only two of the O'Hanlon family remain on the board. Mr Esmond O'Hanlon is 68 and so approaching retirement, which leaves only Mr Timothy O'Hanlon, a non-executive director, behind him - 'this is a very happy, family-dominated company which has looked after its staff throughout its 122 years. It will be a sad day when an O'Hanlon is no longer at the centre of its affairs.'</p>

			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / GPA Group's Aborted Global Issue: Japanese brokers blame flop on Nomura THE unwillingness of Japanese institutions to bid for stock in GPA Group's flotation was a significant factor in the issue's failure, according to Tokyo investment bankers. Despite intense efforts by Nomura Securities, the international co-ordinator for the offer and the lead adviser for Japan, almost all the demand came from retail investors. Underwriting managers at rival securities companies said Nomura's own clients had accounted for about 70 per cent of the total. 'The rest of us sold very, very little. Nothing like as much as Nomura,' said one underwriting manager. Underwriting managers said institutions - like their counterparts in the US and UK - had declined the offer because of the general uncertainty about world financial markets, including the market for aircraft leasing in light of the continuing financial strains on airlines. They also had not fully grasped the nature of GPA's complex business. Moreover, institutions were influenced by the experience of Mitsubishi Trust &amp; Banking, the leading trust bank, and other Japanese investing companies which bought shares in a private deal at Dollars 32 and would have realised a large loss if the offer had proceeded. Mitsubishi trust bank has a close relationship with GPA and has a holding of 13.4 per cent. Some fund managers judged that if Mitsubishi trust bank had lost money then less well-connected and less well-informed investors should stay away. Underwriting managers said that the main interest in the offer came from private individuals who had despaired of finding a good investment in the depressed Japanese market. But, as one underwriting manager said, salesmen were cautious about promoting such stock to individuals since they had even less idea about the nature of GPA than the institutions. There was plenty of recrimination in Tokyo last night with rival brokers heaping the blame for the flop on Nomura. They said Nomura had been over-ambitious. They also said Nomura mishandled the cancellation with some investors receiving the news before others.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] The Opposition yesterday cashed in on Thursday's  abortive international terrorism plot in Bangkok, calling on  Interior Minister Chawalit Yongchaiyut to show his  responsibility over the incident.    Chat Thai Secretary-General Banhan Sinlapa-acha said Gen  Chawalit must take responsibility because he had ordered the  change of the Police Department director-general claiming the  past police boss could not ensure internal peace.    The accidental discovery of the huge bomb in Bangkok only  showed that the people were more vulnerable to danger than ever  before, he said.    Mr Banhan said he admitted that it was beyond the  authorities  to prevent untoward incidents from happening.    However, he said Gen Chawalit must try to explain the  situation to the people when such incidents occur and not just  let them pass silently since that would only cause the public to  panic.    Mr Banhan did not dismiss the possibility that the  Opposition  would use the incident as ammunition to censure Gen Chawalit in  Parliament.    "We will discuss that in May," Mr Banhan said. Parliament  will convene for an ordinary session in May after opening for an  extra session from the end of this month to deliberate the Lower  House members' constitutional amendment proposals.    The Suphan Buri MP said he did not want to say if Gen  Chawalit should "show his political spirit" over the incident.    Chat Thai leader Praman Adireksan said it was not time yet  for the Opposition to initiate a censure motion against Gen  Chawalit but noted "we are thinking about it and will discuss it  later."    Gen Chawalit, talking to reporters in Nakhon Phanom  yesterday, said he would not be worried if the Opposition used  the abortive terrorism plot in Bangkok as a ammunition to  censure him.    He dismissed the suggestion that a spate of bombing  incidents  in the country during his term at the Interior Ministry  indicated that the ministry has failed in its job to maintain  peace and order for the people.    There are more than 60 million people in the country. The  police should be commended for their ability to maintain peace,  he said.    When asked if he believed that violent incidents would cease  if he decided to step down as the Interior Minister Gen Chawalit  quipped:    "You'd better find that out from a fortune teller."    Meanwhile, Army chief Gen Wimon Wongwanit urged all Thais to  help keep vigil against possible international terrorist attacks  in the country.    Returning from his visit to India, Gen Wimon said it was the  duty of all Thais to serve as an eye and ear for the country.    "We must not allow anybody to use Thailand as a stage for  terrorism as that will damage the image and economy," he said.    Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri said it was too early for  the authorities to conclude the nationality of the terrorists  who assembled the home-made bomb.    However, he was confident that investigators would be able  to  obtain more information on the case soon. [passage omitted]    Police Department chief Pratin Santipraphop who led a team  of  top Metropolitan policemen to meet with American diplomats at  the United States Embassy yesterday urged the media to exercise  restraint in presenting news reports about the bomb.    He said the reports could hurt the good relations between  Thailand and friendly countries.    In Nakhon Si Thammarat, Deputy Foreign Minister Surin  Phitsuwan said that terrorist bombings had taken place before in  several other countries, including those where there are tighter  precautionary security measures.    What is important, he said, is when a bombing occurs,  authorities concerned must cooperate with one another and also  with foreign governments to adopt tighter measures to ensure  that the incidents will not be repeated.    Mr Surin suggested officials and politicians be cautious in  making comments, warning that careless remarks may cause  misunderstanding and tarnish the country's image.    He said the foiled bomb plot against the Israeli Embassy was  the work of international terrorists using Thai soil to stage  terrorism.    Fourth Army Region commander Lt-Gen Kitti Rattanachaya,  meanwhile, said it was still too early to say for sure that  there was a link between southern terrorist bandits and the  terrorists who planned to attack the Israeli Embassy in Bangkok  last week.</p>

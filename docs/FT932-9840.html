			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / E Midlands confident on sales outlook MANUFACTURING output in the east Midlands remains sluggish, but business confidence in the region is high. These are the mixed findings of the latest regional business survey conducted by Price Waterhouse, the accountants, and Nottingham Business School, which is published today. The survey, covering 973 companies, the vast majority of which employ fewer than 200 people, notes that 66 per cent of companies across all sectors predict an increase in sales over the next six months. But the survey says 'manufacturing volumes show few signs of increasing with only 27 per cent of businesses reporting that current utilisation of capacity is above 90 per cent.' Six months ago, when the last survey was published, the proportion was 29 per cent. Economic recovery is signalled by a number of findings, however. For 39 per cent of companies order books are fatter than in spring last year. Stock turnover has started to speed up for 29 per cent of companies, compared with 24 per cent six months ago, and 39 per cent of businesses reported increased profitability. Yet companies expect the programme of pit closures in the Midlands to hold back consumer spending and increase unemployment. Reflecting the national experience, the speed of increase in the number of unemployed people has slowed. Twenty-eight per cent of companies expect to enlarge their workforce in the next half-year. The balance in the labour market remains in favour of employers. More than half the wage awards in the past six months have been less than 2.5 per cent. Only 9 per cent of awards exceeded 5 per cent.

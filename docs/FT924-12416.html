			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Greenalls makes Pounds 86m cash call GREENALLS GROUP, the pubs and hotels operator, yesterday announced a Pounds 86m rights issue to help finance the expansion of its core businesses. The cash call is being made through a 1-for-5 issue of 29.95m shares at 295p, a 17.8 per cent discount to Monday's closing price of 359p. The shares fell 15p yesterday to 344p. Mr Andrew Thomas, chairman and chief executive, said that the recession offered opportunities to expand by acquiring quality assets at low prices. 'We believe that the company should have the financial resources to take full advantage of these opportunities as they arise, while maintaining prudent debt levels and interest cover.' The issue will reduce gearing from 27.5 per cent to 14.5 per cent. A rights issue had been widely expected since the group completed its transformation from regional brewer to national hotelier and pub operator earlier this year with the abolition of its two-tier share structure and the Greenall family's control. The family now holds a 16.2 per cent stake which will be reduced to 13.5 per cent if it does not take up its rights. Now one of the UK's largest independent pub operators with 1,400 outlets, Greenalls has this year spent Pounds 40m on extending and upgrading its estate. It has spent a further Pounds 16m in developing its 100 specialist food and accommodation pubs. 'We intend to focus further investment on the pub business through hand-picked acquisitions, ' said Mr Thomas. 'We shall exploit the full retail potential of the estate rather than pursue beer sales alone.' The group also aims to develop its De Vere hotels operation into a leading four and five star chain, concentrating on the conference and leisure market. This year it has acquired the Belton Woods hotel and golf complex for Pounds 10m, invested Pounds 10m in extensions to the Grand Hotel, Brighton, and opened another hotel at Swindon. Two more hotels will be opened at Leeds and Southampton in the next two years. There are also plans to expand the off-licence chain, strengthened this year by the Pounds 20m acquisition of 187 Blayneys shops from Vaux. Greenalls estimates that pre-tax profits for the year to September 25 will be not less than Pounds 63m, compared with last year's Pounds 64.1m. Trading profits in the second half had been lower than the corresponding period last year as the business climate failed to improve, said Mr Thomas. The fall in hotel profits had slowed as a result of improved occupancies but room rates remained under pressure. Pub profits had been affected by poor weather in July and August but showed a slight improvement in September. The company forecast a final dividend of 6.93p, which will be payable on the rights shares, lifting the total from 11p to 11.77p. Cazenove are brokers to the issue, which has been fully underwritten by Schroders. See Lex</p>

			<p><P> August 10, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> ANOTHER HURDLE FOR BEN JOHNSON  </P> <P> Ben Johnson got the green light from the Canadian government to return to  competition, but his eligibility for teams sanctioned by the Canadian Olympic  Assn. has not been determined, the association said today.  </P> <P> The COA, which has jurisdiction over Canadian participation in the Olympics and  the Pan American Games, said in a news release that it reserves the right to  extend any suspension imposed by national or international federations.  </P> <P> Johnson was barred by track's world governing body and the Canadian association  after he tested positive for steroids at the 1988 Olympics.  </P> <P> Federal Sport Minister Marcel Danis announced Thursday that although the  government's lifetime ban on funding to the Toronto sprinter would remain in  effect, any decision on competitive sanctions would rest with the sport's  national governing body, Athletics Canada.  </P> <P> Johnson's two-year suspension from international competition ends Sept. 24, and  Athletics Canada says he will be welcomed back, provided he meets team  qualifying standards.  </P> <P> Frank Ratcliffe, communications manager for the Canadian Olympic Assn., said in  an interview that although the COA will not necessarily extend the suspension  when its executive committee meets next month in Toronto, it reserves the right  to do so.  </P></p>

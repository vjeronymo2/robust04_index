			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report London's robusta COFFEE futures closed firmer but below the day's highs. The market was showing signs that it might be poised to break above its recent range. Roasters appeared to be trying to increase their cover and origins appeared to be cutting sales in the expectation of further gains. Producer talks on a retention scheme were beginning to be taken seriously by the trade after initial scepticism. Brazil, in particular, has been more supportive than some expected. Chicago SOYABEAN futures were sagging at midsession on profit taking, tied to ideas that the market was extremely overbought. Trading was choppy as the market continued to digest numerous reports and opinions about the extent of flood-damage to the crop in the western US Midwest. 'There is a lot of profit taking and nervousness,' one trader said. Three-month COPPER see-sawed routinely either side of Dollars 1,900 a tonne on the London Metal Exchange with support around Dollars 1,890 providing a pivotal rallying point. Three-month ALUMINIUM broke higher in early afternoon trading on US buying which found sellers backing away. Compiled from Reuters</p>

			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / SPD warns of threat to democracy: German opposition fears Bonn policy towards east is fostering growth of far right GERMANY'S democratic system will be 'threatened' if there is not an early and radical change in government policy towards eastern Germany and the costs of unification, the opposition Social Democrats (SPD) warned yesterday. Accusing the coalition government of Chancellor Helmut Kohl of 'disguising' the extent of economic collapse in the east of the country, of underestimating the costs of recovery, and of lacking any serious ideas to deal with it, Mr Bjorn Engholm, the SPD leader, announced his own readiness to form an alternative government. The escalation in the conflict between the opposition and the government appears to be a direct consequence of a clear swing in the latest elections to extreme right-wing parties, and to growing talk of the need for a grand coalition between the SPD and Mr Kohl's Christian Democrats (CDU) to deal with the unification crisis. In spite of his blunt criticism, Mr Engholm has agreed to take part in cross-party talks on May 27, provided that they discuss the government's budget crisis, and its entire strategy for reviving the east German economy. At the same time he has ordered his party machine to prepare a complete alternative government programme, to be ready within two months, in an open challenge to the Kohl coalition. Yesterday the party agreed to call for a new tax surcharge on the higher-paid, and on German enterprises, to reduce the yawning public sector deficit, currently running at DM45bn for central government alone. The direst warning came from Mr Harald Ringsdorff, chairman of the Social Democrats in the eastern state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, who warned that 'parliamentary democracy will be in danger' if there was no improvement in the eastern economy. He said evidence from schools in the former east Germany suggested that half the pupils, even in the elite 'gymnasium' schools, were listening to parties from the extreme right. He said that the real level of unemployment meant that one in every two potential workers was jobless in many areas, and he called for a change in the entire industrial strategy of the Treuhand privatisation agency to promote active restructuring of old enterprises.</p>

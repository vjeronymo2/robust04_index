"That is now up to the bosses," Defense Minister  Volker Ruehe, of the Christian Democratic Union, said on Friday  [11 March] in Berlin at the conclusion of a three-day visit to  Germany by his Russian counterpart Pavel Grachev. The Russian  defense minister said that the Russians want to be sent off as  partners and friends.    On Friday, Grachev visited a Bundeswehr unit in Brandenburg.  Accompanied by Minister Ruehe, he was observing an exercise of  soldiers of an armored infantry battalion and a motorized  infantry battalion at the Lehnin training area. Afterwards the  two ministers laid wreaths at the Soviet memorial and the 20  July 1944 memorial. Thus, for the first time a Russian  politician has honored the heroes of the German resistance of 20  July 1944 by laying a wreath.    The Bundeswehr and the Russian Army intend to cooperate more  closely in the future in the areas of environmental protection  at the level of Armed Forces and the exchange of officers.  Agreements to this effect were signed by the two ministers on  Friday. In a first stage, three Russian officers should study  at the Bundeswehr's command and control academy in Hamburg and  one German colonel at the Moscow military academy. In addition,  joint navy exercises were agreed for this year in the Baltic  Sea. Plans for 1995 include the participation of German  soldiers in an exercise in Russia.</p>

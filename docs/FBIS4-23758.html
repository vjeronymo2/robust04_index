			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Comment and Opinion" page: "Lest we forget"; </F> article published in English]    [Text] If the African National Congress is to establish a  so-called Truth Commission, then we hope it will turn its  attention to matters which have thus far confounded the  Goldstone Commission.    Both the President and the Minister of Justice have said  that  people who come forward to confess their crimes will be granted  indemnity.    We hope that amongst the people who come forward to confess  will be those responsible for the serial murder of more than 350  leaders of the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] and thousands of its  supporters.    The President of the ANC and current State President, Mr  Nelson Mandela, went before the United Nations and labelled the  IFP a surrogate of the former South African Government.    If one were to believe him, then one must logically assume  that the former government would not have murdered IFP leaders.    Now, logic compels one to conclude that the IFP cannot be  guilty of murdering its own leaders. So, if the former  government was not murdering the IFP, must one conclude that it  was the ANC?    Mr Justice Richard Goldstone, a strong supporter of the  proposed Truth Commission, was seemingly unable to cast any  light on the matter. Under the circumstances, what hope is  there that the identity of the murderers will be brought into  the light? Are they likely to confess to the truth commission?  One would have to believe in miracles to expect that.    We repeat -- the murder of the IFP leaders and its  supporters  is a crime of monumental proportions against the people of this  land. If those punting a truth commission want to be taken  seriously, they should tell the loved ones of those that have  been murdered how they intend going about solving these murders.    After all one of the two -- the former government and the  current one -- must either know something about these dastardly  crimes or at least know how to go about solving them.</p>

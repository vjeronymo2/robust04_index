			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / Community at a crossroads: The single market is a significant achievement for the EC, but structural problems loom The inauguration of the single European market is a huge achievement for the European Community, the culmination of four decades of steady trade liberalisation and going far beyond the original targets of the first member states. What started in 1951 as a limited system for managing the coal and steel industries of the original Six, has now reached the impressive conclusion of a single market with freedom of movement for goods, services, people and capital throughout the 12. This single market will no doubt bring important improvements to the competitiveness of Europe's economy, to the welfare of its consumers, and to the conditions for long-term economic growth. And yet the celebrations of the free-market achievement of 1993 are overshadowed by a series of political setbacks in 1992, as well as by more general doubts over the direction of the European Community. Since the conclusion of the Treaty of European Union at Maastricht a year ago, many of the premises and programmes of the treaty have been shaken to their foundations, and the course of Europe's future development is now a matter of real uncertainty. The first of the 1992 setbacks was the rejection of the Maastricht agreement in the Danish referendum last June, which immediately raised doubts whether the treaty could ever be implemented. At last month's Edinburgh summit, Denmark and the other 11 governments hammered out a form of words which they hoped would make it possible to have a second referendum in Denmark, and with luck this time get a Yes vote. If that happens, there should be a reasonable prospect that the treaty would also be ratified in Britain, and therefore formally come into force. Unfortunately, it is not clear that the Danish problem can be rectified as easily as that. The 12 have claimed that their Edinburgh decision is acceptable because it is consistent with the terms of the Maastricht treaty. The treaty itself would allow Denmark to opt out of monetary union at some stage; but the Edinburgh deal would allow Denmark to opt out of monetary union even before the treaty is ratified. The new decision may be consistent with the treaty; but an ordinary person can see it is really a cunning device for voiding the treaty of much of its significance. This points to the heart of the Maastricht problem. The treaty mainly consists of plans and programmes for future action; but some of the member states do not really subscribe to their new undertakings. The single most important element in Maastricht is the programme for monetary union; but the controversy has highlighted the fact that the Danes do not want monetary union, nor indeed do they much care for any of the treaty. Mutatis mutandis, the same is true of the British. The Community is therefore in a serious dilemma, not just over whether Maastricht can be ratified, but over how much political credibility it will retain even after ratification. Three months after the Danish referendum, the Community suffered a second body-blow, in the September currency turmoil which drove sterling and the Italian lira out of the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM), and forced the devaluation of the Spanish peseta and the Portuguese escudo. The upheaval delivered a heavy blow to the stability of the ERM, and seriously undermined the plausibility of the programme for Economic and Monetary Union as laid out in the Maastricht treaty. The development of a common foreign policy is the second main policy target in the treaty, and it too suffered a serious setback in 1992, as a result of the comprehensive inadequacy of the European Community's response to the war in the former Yugoslavia. This failure does not prove anything conclusive about the long term; it certainly does not exonerate the Community countries from continuing to work on the development of a more common foreign policy; but at the very least the Yugoslav tragedy indicates the sheer difficulty of this part of the Community's Maastricht agenda, and the yawning gap between treaty promise and practical performance. The question which is not yet resolved is whether the specific setbacks suffered by the Community in 1992 are just temporary difficulties, resulting from the difficult circumstances of the time; or whether they are symptoms of a deeper and more durable structural problem. Undoubtedly, these are difficult times. The collapse of the cold war has released forces of instability and violence at many points in the former Soviet empire. The international recession is both deeper and longer than anyone expected, high-lighting potential stresses in the ERM. And the colossal costs of Germany's unification have created additional political and economic difficulties, first for Germany, but also for the rest of the Community. And yet the Community may be facing a double structural problem, in the sense that it has come to the end of the road which it has been travelling for the past 40 years. With the single market it has more or less fulfilled the common market objectives laid down by the original six 35 years ago; as a result of the end of the cold war, it is facing a massive pent-up demand for membership from countries which used to be either neutral or Communist. The Maastricht treaty now sets an entirely new order of objectives, which are much more demanding. Each extra step in the development of European integration will become increasingly difficult, because the tensions between the historic systems of the nation states and the emerging Community system will become increasingly politically stressful. It is in any case unlikely that the member states can attain the new policy objectives through the old institutional arrangements. The Community has now effectively exhausted those items on the integration agenda which are relatively innocuous in political terms, such as trade liberation. The next phase inevitably includes issues more heavily loaded with nationalist connotations, such as a single currency or a common defence, and implies a degree of political integration which will meet serious reservations on the part of national electorates. These politically sensitive issues can neither be side-stepped nor ignored. If there is an ERM, and a single market with free movement of capital, the members cannot easily have independent monetary policies. Yet the lesson of 1992 is that the ERM is unlikely to work well unless it is coupled with collective constraints on fiscal policies as well. Parliaments may accept that national politicians cannot be trusted with monetary policy; they will resist the matching idea that politicians cannot be trusted with fiscal policy either. European orthodoxy usually argues that this dilemma of democracy can best be solved by giving more powers to the European Parliament. But this is still essentially a Community with very little real power delegated to a supranational authority at the centre; for the time being, political legitimacy in a more politically integrated Community has to be exercised by the nation states and in national parliaments. These inherent policy dilemmas will be multiplied many times by large increases in the size of the Community; and yet the Community is almost bound to take in many new members in the next few years, first from the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), then from the Mediterranean, and finally from eastern Europe. The Edinburgh summit agreed to open membership negotiations with the EFTA applicants right away, even before Maastricht ratification is complete. If all the potential candidates do in fact join, the total size of the Community could expand to 25 members or even more. Manifestly, this would change the character of the Community. It could not easily take any decisions; it certainly could not take decisions by current institutional arrangements. Moreover, these procedural difficulties must be multiplied by the political consequences of enlargement; a large and geographically dispersed Community is likely to exhibit a corresponding dispersal of political interests. If Belgium has more in common with Luxembourg than Poland has with Greece, this is not surprising; they have much more shared history, and much more shared geography. In a large Community, it is only too easy to imagine various geographic caucuses systematically voting against each other: the rich Nordics against poor Mediterraneans, or the west against the east. If the Community is to go further, in the general direction charted by Maastricht, it will almost certainly have to find new ways of doing so, and most likely re-think the traditional Community system. This need will be even more imperative if it takes in significant numbers of new member states. With the single market, the European Community has reached the end of a particular stretch of road; today, it stands at a crossroads of history.</p>

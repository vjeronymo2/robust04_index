			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / H&amp;C rises 12% after cost-cutting FRANCE IS trading in croissants for breakfast cereal, helping Harrisons &amp; Crosfield, the chemicals, building supplies, food and agriculture company to report interim pre-tax profits 12 per cent higher at Pounds 40.6m. 'They have at long last discovered breakfast cereal,' said Mr George Paul, chief executive. The group's breakfast cereal factory in northern France had performed 'excellently' in the first half and would be expanded, he said. The main impetus to profits, however, appeared to be a combination of cost-cutting and a 67 per cent improvement in H&amp;C's traditional plantations business. Higher palm oil prices helped this division to increase operating profits Pounds 3.4m to Pounds 8.5m. Mr John Maltby, chairman, said the group had seen no sign of an upturn in the UK, although there were slight signs of recovery in the US. Group turnover fell 4 per cent to Pounds 873m for the six months to June 30. The dividend was maintained at 3.6p, barely covered by earnings of 3.7p (3.6p) per share. Mr Paul defended the group's decision to maintain the dividend. 'We are not trying to send any signal except confidence,' he said. Mr Bill Turcan, finance director, said the group could contain a maintained total dividend for the year of 9p, without exceeding its gearing target of about 60 per cent. Gearing at the half-year was 56 per cent. Harrisons' timber and building supplies business showed a resilient performance in the US and the Republic of Ireland, and operating profits of that division rose 13 per cent to Pounds 11.1m. The chemicals division rose 5 per cent to Pounds 17.2m, while food and agriculture fell from Pounds 16m to Pounds 14.8m. The latter division was lower because of the sale of a savoury flavours business at the beginning of the year and a decline in malt deliveries. The integration costs of BOCM-Silcock, the animals feeds business purchased for Pounds 67m in April, would come to Pounds 16m, said Mr Turcan. He added however, that the costs would be recovered through the sale of assets and sites. There would be no effect on the profit and loss account, he said. Lex, Page 16</p>

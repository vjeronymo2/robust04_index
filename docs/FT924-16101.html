			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / Clinton fears damage from Perot return PRESIDENT George Bush and Governor Bill Clinton yesterday braced themselves against the prospect that Mr Ross Perot, the Texas computer billionaire, would re-enter the US presidential election. Mr Clinton, the Democratic candidate, said that Mr Perot could cost him the White House if he decides to resume the campaign he interrupted in July, a decision Mr Perot has promised to announce by this evening. 'He could give the election to Bush if those who want change are equally divided,' Mr Clinton said in a television interview yesterday. The Bush camp, however, appeared to view Mr Perot's entry more calmly. The president's re-election bid has made so little inroad into Mr Clinton's lead that his advisers appear to welcome anything that could shake up the race. A Perot candidacy could do that, although pollsters are uncertain how it would affect the outcome of the November 3 election. Mr Perot could hurt either candidate, taking votes from Mr Bush in Texas and Florida, and from Mr Clinton in the Midwest and perhaps California, or damage both equally. However, the unflattering press coverage Mr Perot experienced before suspending his campaign in July has been already resumed. Most newspapers yesterday reported critically on the salaries Mr Perot has paid to his so-called volunteers, or political supporters, as well as on the disgruntlement of voters who had telephoned his headquarters to urge him not to run, only to find that their call was automatically recorded as an expression of support. Even without a Perot re-entry, Mr Bush has sought to shake up the campaign with a change of heart on the issue of televised debates. Mr Bush's proposal on Tuesday to hold four presidential debates, including Mr Perot if he should declare his candidacy, has been coolly received by the Clinton campaign. But, while its details can be criticised (three of the proposed dates would clash with big baseball matches), the initiative has doused the Clinton supporters dressed in chicken costumes who have taunted the president at every campaign stop for his refusal to debate. Most pollsters now believe Mr Perot could win almost as many votes as earlier independent candidates such as Governor George Wallace, who received 13.5 per cent of the vote in 1968, or Robert LaFollette, the Wisconsin populist who scored 16.6 per cent in 1924. Few expect him to match Theodore Roosevelt, who beat the Republican candidate out of second place in 1912 with 27.4 per cent of the vote.</p>

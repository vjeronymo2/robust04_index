			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / Trucks headed off at the pass: The Swiss ban has shocked the neighbours 'The Gotthard was anciently perhaps the most frequented passage over the Alps, as it offered the most direct and practicable line of communication from northern Switzerland and western Germany, to Lombardy, and the important cities of Milan and Genoa. Not less than 16,000 travellers and 9,000 horses crossed it annually on the average, down to the commencement of the present century' - Murray's Handbook for Travellers in Switzerland, 1838 The problem is the pollution,' says Mrs Marie-Therese Hogg, a young housewife and mother of two in Andermatt, a Swiss village in the middle of the Gotthard pass. Mrs Hogg was not referring to horses, but to the 2,500 trucks a day that have replaced earlier forms of transport on the ever popular trans-Alpine route. While in previous centuries, travellers and their carriages brought prosperity to the tiny Swiss canton of Uri that bestrides the Gotthard, the trucks bring only misery. 'My older son has asthma. Our family doctor says the incidence of asthma here is far higher than normal,' Mrs Hogg says. Mr Beat Baumann, a mountain guide based in Uri's historic capital of Altdorf, says that, in the summer, residents are often advised to remain indoors rather than risk breathing the fumes from the nearby motorway. In the past month, the 34,000 inhabitants of Uri have risen up against their oppressor, mounting an effective campaign to convince their fellow Swiss to support their petition to ban transit lorries from the Alps. Knowing that their own reputation as rather dour mountain folk would not win much sympathy for their plight - one exasperated federal minister referred to them this week as troglodytes - the Uri campaigners emphasised the damage being done to the Alpine flora and fauna by fumes. The stratagem worked. Last Sunday, nearly 52 per cent of all Swiss ignored federal government advice and voted in favour of forcing all transit freight traffic to shift from the road to the railways from 2004. The result was an unpleasant shock for the country's neighbours. Officials of the European Union, who had only two years ago agreed trans-Alpine truck limits with Switzerland, wondered if it was worth negotiating anything any more with the recalcitrant Swiss. The EU's powerful trucking lobbies were apoplectic. If the EU does stop negotiating with Bern on other issues, anti-EU sentiment in Switzerland could well harden, forcing an indefinite postponement of Bern's plan to attempt to join the Union in a few years. These weighty considerations had little influence in Uri. 'The (trucks) vote had nothing to do with European politics,' says Mrs Hogg. 'It was about our future.' Mr Hansruedi Stadler, Uri's youthful governor, agrees. Sitting in a modest office at Altdorf looking over a square dominated by a statue of Wilhelm Tell, he asks rhetorically: 'What could I tell my six-year-old son in 10 years if we had not done everything we could to stop the destruction of our region?' Uri is not isolationist, Mr Stadler insists. Unlike some other mountain regions in Switzerland, it has enjoyed constant contact with the outside world since the 13th century, when the Gotthard pass was opened. The problem is that the narrow Reuss valley leading up to the Gotthard is Uri's only habitable territory. The rest is so steep that only goats and chamois can survive there. Until the late 20th century, the stately pace of travel meant that it was pleasant to be an important transit corridor. Everyone stopped in Uri's village inns for food and lodging. But since the construction of an all-weather motorway in the 1970s, it has become easy to drive from one end of the canton to the other in 45 minutes. 'Most people in transit now stop in Uri only to go to the toilet, if they stop at all,' Mr Stadler says. He adds that the fumes from the trucks can hang in the narrow valley for days if the wind is light and the fog is thick, which it often is. Mrs Hogg says even the Ursuren valley around Andermatt, high above the Gotthard tunnels, often becomes polluted because of fumes from the road tunnel exhaust vents. Mr Baumann sees other problems on the steep mountain sides. 'Trees have been killed, then knocked down by the strong fohn (south-west wind) storms, increasing the incidence of avalanches and landslides.' Local people also worry about an environmental catastrophe. Trucks are not allowed to carry dangerous substances along the route, but many do. An explosion in the Gotthard tunnel would have appalling consequences: a spill of chemicals into the Reuss could contaminate the entire Rhine valley, Mr Baumann says. So are Uri's people satisfied now that they can see the end of the truck blight? And how do they feel about the constant rise in motor car traffic? Mr Stadler sighs. 'Yes, cars . . . obviously, we would prefer that more of them would take the old road and stop at our inns.'</p>

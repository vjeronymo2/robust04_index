			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Muhammad Abu-Khudayr] </F>   [Excerpts] Jerusalem -- Dr. Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi, former  head of the Palestinian delegation, has said that the Cairo  agreement does not call for optimism because what Israel is  doing and implementing on the ground contradicts the concept of  peace.    'Abd-al-Shafi asked: Does 'Arafat's hesitation in signing  the maps prove that there is a contradiction between what is  written and what is drawn?    'Abd-al-Shafi added that the agreement places many obstacles  to reaching a just peace and gives Israel more reasons to cling  to its inflexible stance and its claim that it has a right to  the occupied territories. He noted that Israel has expressed  its positions by setting up more settlements and annexing  Jerusalem, in addition to the numerous measures that it has  practiced against our people.    'Abd-al-Shafi said: At any rate, now we are facing a fait  accompli, which will confront us with new threats. [passage  omitted]    Shaykh Jamil al-Hamami, one of the most prominent Islamic  figures in the occupied territories, said: I am pained and  saddened over what happened in Cairo. Is this how one manages  the future of a people and nation and the struggle of  generations of people? If this is proof of anything, it is lack  of seriousness in discussing the Palestinian people's fate and  the Palestinian cause.    Al-Hamami said: This agreement represents a great obstacle  to achieving a just and comprehensive peace and to realizing the  Palestinian people's aspirations. We in the occupied  territories feel very sad in light of Israeli arrogance, the  settlers' practices, and the U.S. Administration's support for  Israel.    Al-Hamami added: This is a temporary and not a permanent  agreement because it does not respond to the aspirations and  hopes of our Muslim Palestinian people, who have been patient  and have suffered and endured. I do not think this is the end  as the agreement is stillborn. [passage omitted]    Dr. Hanan 'Ashrawi said that the Palestinian people deal  with  reality and not with conferences, papers, and political  positions. They are endeavoring to remove and end the  occupation. She added that while the agreement was being signed  in Cairo by the PLO chairman, Israel continued to impose a  blockade on Jerusalem and settlers were engaged in provocative  acts.    Dr. 'Ashrawi said: We are not against peace, but the process  should be based on fundamental considerations and a cumulative  momentum that lead to obtaining rights, not beautifying them and  maintaining the occupation.    For his part, Faysal al-Husayni said: It was not necessary  to abide by the date of the signing of the agreement and to  leave important issues. It would have been better to postpone  the signing until an agreement with clear outlines was reached.    In a related development, most of the Palestinian figures in  the occupied territories who support the peace process refused  to attend the signing ceremony to express their reservations to  the agreement.</p>

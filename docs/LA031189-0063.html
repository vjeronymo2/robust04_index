			<p><P> March 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST : LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> 10 ARRESTED IN BIG SEIZURE OF COCAINE  </P> <P> Police have seized nearly 598 pounds of cocaine hidden in a trailer load of  furniture outside a Victorville motel and arrested 10 men and women on  suspicion of trafficking in the drug, authorities said.  </P> <P> The seizure early Thursday morning concluded an investigation that began two  months ago in Torrance and led police to Lawndale, Chino, the San Fernando  Valley and Diamond Bar, Torrance Police Sgt. Ron Traber said.  </P> <P> The 10 suspects were being held on $5-million bail each at the Torrance Jail.  </P> <P> Torrance detectives were watching Wednesday night when Carlos Mejia, 25, and  Pamela Garcia, 27, both of New York City, left a Diamond Bar home in a car  towing a moving trailer, Traber said.  </P> <P> Police said they arrested the couple at 3 a.m. at a motel in the San Bernardino  County community, where they had stopped for the night. Detectives said that  they found the drugs in a secret compartment inside the trailer and that the  shipment was destined for an East Coast distributor.  </P> <P> At the same time, police raided three homes -- in Diamond Bar, Sherman Oaks and  Cerritos -- and arrested five men and three women for alleged trafficking in  cocaine. More than $150,000 in cash was seized, along with another 22 pounds of  cocaine, Traber said.  </P></p>

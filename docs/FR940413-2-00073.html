Established as of October 1, 1989, the National Center for Human Genome Research (NCHGR) is the focal point within the NIH and the Department of Health and Human Services for the development of research policy and long-range planning for the NIH component of the Human Genome Project. NCHGR's Division of Extramural Research funds research in laboratories throughout the country in chromosome mapping, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequencing, database development, technology development, and studies of the ethical, legal, and social implications of genetics research. NCHGR's newly established Division of Intramural Research plans to focus on technologies for finding disease genes, developing DNA diagnostics and gene therapies. The Division will serve as a hub for NIH-wide human genetics research and enhance the work of investigators in other Institutes who are searching for specific genes and studying their function in health and disease. This system of records will be used by NIH to support clinical research aimed at understanding the genetic basis of human disease, its diagnosis and treatment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The system will comprise records that contain information identifying participants (such as name, address, Social Security number), medical records (including psychosocial evaluations), progress reports, correspondence, epidemiological data, research findings, and records on biological specimens, (e.g., blood, urine, and genetic materials). Provision of the Social Security number is voluntary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The amount of information recorded on each individual will be only that which is necessary to accomplish the purpose of the system. The records in this system will be maintained in a secure manner compatible with their content and use. NIH and contractor staff will be required to adhere to the provisions of the Privacy Act and the HHS Privacy Act Regulations. The System Manager will control access to the data. Only authorized users whose official duties require the use of such information will have regular access to the records in this system. Authorized users are HHS employees, and contractors responsible for implementing the clinical research. Researchers authorized to conduct research on biological specimens will have access to the system through the use of encrypted identifiers sufficient to link individuals with records in such a manner that does not compromise confidentiality of the individual. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Records will be stored in file folders, computer tapes, computer diskettes, microfiche, and file cards. Manual and computerized records will be maintained in accordance with the standards of Chapter 45&hyph;13 of the HHS General Administration Manual, ``Safeguarding Records Contained in Systems of Records,'' supplementary Chapter PHS hf: 45&hyph;13, the Department's Automated Information System Security Program Handbook, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS Pub. 41 and FIPS Pub. 31). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Data stored in computers will be accessed through the use of keywords known only to authorized users. Rooms where records are stored are locked when not in use. During regular business hours, rooms are unlocked but are controlled by on-site personnel. Depending upon the sensitivity of the information in the record, additional safeguard measures are employed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / Property: From domes to towers - John Barham reports on the changing face of Buenos Aires A few years ago, the sight of a busy building site in Buenos Aires provoked in passers-by a look of mild curiosity. Their response was understandable: there had been little construction activity in the city over the previous decade. Today, building sites are blossoming throughout the city. In fact, since 1991 the city centre, particularly its cramped business district, has become one big building site. Years of runaway inflation and economic decline had depressed construction to less than 100,000 square metres a year by the late 1980s. Today total new constructions have increased to 2m sq m a year. This leap in building activity is the consequence of the free-market reforms unveiled by President Carlos Menem in 1989. The market liberalisation ushered in a construction boom, low inflation (from a peak of 200 per cent a month to 0.1 per cent a month today), privatisation and economic growth of 6 per cent a year. Mr Eduardo Elsztain, president of IRSA, Argentina's only quoted property developer, said: 'Economic stability led to a rise in property values, and encouraged many Argentines to bring back their 'flight capital' from abroad to invest in property at home.' Initially, much of this renewed domestic investor demand was used to mop up the property surplus from the previous upswing, which petered out in 1980. But such has been the pace of demand since the early 1990s that there is already a shortage of prime office accommodation. Mr Alberto Cardello of surveyors Inverlad, the local associate of UK property company Richard Ellis, estimates that construction of offices, apartments and shops has risen 20-fold since the low point in 1989. Seven office blocks are currently going up within a stone's throw of each other on one of the last vacant plots of land in the city's business district. When completed, the new buildings will increase Argentina's 2.5m sq m stock of office space by one-fifth. As the market has become more liquid, more property deals are being concluded, including many with international companies attracted to the city as operators of privatised utilities. But rising values are also forcing some companies to think twice about Buenos Aires: a year ago, IBM failed to sell and lease back its Buenos Aires headquarters after it refused to pay the high rent demanded by the prospective purchasers. While rents for new high-rise offices in Buenos Aires remain high, developers in the city say rents for old offices in the crowded financial district are falling. In addition, industry observers warn that too much uncontrolled development could soon lead to a surplus. Critics point, for instance, to the plans unveiled by the property arm of the Argentine food giant, Bunge y Born, as an example of constructions which may ultimately lie empty. Mr Juan Goni, general manager of the property division, said the company has a Dollars 100m portfolio of empty land which it is trading to generate cash to reinvest in property. One project under way is a Dollars 65m, 26-floor office block in the city's business district, jointly funded by Bunge, the Aoki Corp of Japan and a local construction group. 'We think that those who had the courage and went ahead first (with developments) will be successful. I am not sure about those who came later,' said Mr Goni. In any event, despite concerns in the office sector, developers remain bullish, largely because of optimism about the residential and retail property sectors. The availability of relatively cheap 15 per cent mortgages - until three years ago mortgages were unavailable - are drawing the middle class into the property market for the first time in a generation. For years home ownership has been the preserve of those able to pay in cash. To make housing more widely available, President Menem last week unveiled a four-year programme to build 166,000 homes. The properties, costing between Dollars 40,000 and Dollars 50,000, would be financed by private financial institutions. The government is assisting with further dismantling of planning regulations. Investor interest has also honed in on shopping centres: French-owned Carrefour, Argentina's leading retailer, recently bought a Dollars 20m plot in Buenos Aires on which to build its eighth hypermarket in Argentina. Wal-Mart of the US is to pay Bunge Dollars 20m for a 100,000 sq m former factory site where it will erect a hyper-market, its first in Argentina. IRSA has begun work on a project to convert Buenos Aires' central market into a shopping and housing complex. The company paid Dollars 54.6m for the site in a run-down district of the city. The past fours years of frenetic activity has inevitably provoked criticism from people who say the dash for high-rise structures is doing untold damage to the city's distinctive Parisian architectural character. The outcome has been a rapid disfigurement of Buenos Aires' skyline of cupolas and domes; today, the skyline is dominated by glass and steel towers. There are some notable exceptions. Argentine-born architect Cesar Pelli - who designed the Canary Wharf tower in London's docklands - has created a widely-admired 29,000 sq m office block, inspired by the smooth, curved lines of a ship's hull. Opponents of government housing and inner-city policies have singled out for criticism the run-down Retiro railway station, which the authorities hope to turn into a vast shopping/conference/exhibition complex. Mr Antonio Cartana, the city's ombudsman, said: 'Retiro is not a renovation project, but the clearest and most direct manifestation of the causes of urban and social collapse - profit-seeking interventions by those connected to the government.' Developers also point to an over-stretched transport and utility infrastructure and the absence of clear planning regulations as impediments to potential developments. Buenos Aires' legislative council, for instance, often grants planning permission that runs counter to its own zoning regulations, which are designed to restrict property constructions in certain areas. As a result, says Mr Roberto Salem, the city's urban planning and environment secretary, 'you get a 50-storey building on a site that is meant for 10 storeys. These exceptions are the result of influence, politics and lobbying. It's sad to recognise it, but it is true.'</p>

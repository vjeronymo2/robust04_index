			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / Easier exchange controls boost Kenyan business KENYA'S private sector is taking advantage of a partial liberalisation of the hitherto strict foreign exchange controls to repatriate blocked dividends and pay for imports. Nairobi bankers and businessmen said yesterday that the freely convertible foreign exchange certificates of deposit, introduced by the government last October under its structural adjustment programme, had given the private sector a small boost of confidence in an otherwise gloomy economic environment. According to bankers at least Dollars 6m-Dollars 7m of the certificates have already been issued by the Central Bank of Kenya and about half have been redeemed. Demand for the certificates is high among foreign banks and companies desperate to repatriate an estimated Dollars 60m (Pounds 33m) of dividends blocked from 1989 and 1990 and importers previously denied foreign exchange allocations. An embryonic inter-bank market in the certificates is beginning to develop as commercial banks catch on to the pilot scheme. The certificates are trading at a premium of 12-15 per cent above the prevailing rate of exchange  -about 5-10 per cent below the black market rate for the Kenya shilling. Until the policy was introduced foreign companies had to wait up to 30 months for the Central Bank to unblock their profits which, while earning 17-18 per cent interest, were suffering from a weakening currency. The Kenya shilling depreciated against the US dollar last year by 17 per cent. So far the scheme has remained limited because the biggest denomination for the certificates is Dollars 10,000 and few bankers have caught on to trading the certificates. The government has also yet to include the export of goods and services under the regulations. Furthermore, foreign exchange flowing into the country has slowed to a trickle as donors have suspended aid programmes because of corruption and economic mismanagement, and investors, apart from a few in the tourism sector, remain cautious about the economic prospects. Estimates suggest that Kenya's foreign reserves could be as little as 3-5 weeks of imports. Kenyan businessmen are hoping that, faced with a critical shortage of foreign exchange in the next four months, the government will stand by, and even expand, the scheme and squeeze public sector imports instead.</p>

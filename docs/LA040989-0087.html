			<p><P> April 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ORLANDO, FLA. -- WILL IT BECOME HOLLYWOOD EAST?;  </P> <P> UNIVERSAL AND DISNEY HAVE COMMITTED A COMBINED $1 BILLION FOR PRODUCTION  FACILITIES AND STUDIO TOURS  </P> <P> Rock 'n' roll blares and nearly a dozen Mouseketeers skip onto a Disney sound  stage, past the neon diner counter, past a pink refrigerator labeled "Eisner."  Twenty years ago, this would have been Circus Day at the Mickey Mouse Club. But  times have changed, so: "It's Thursday, Party Day," exclaims 13-year-old Damon  Pampolina, "and it's going to be a hot, hot, hot party!" No somber uniforms and  Mickey Mouse ears for these hot partygoers; they're decked out in jeans and  high-tops and colorful barrettes.  </P> <P> Ten miles up the highway, at Universal Studios, times also have changed at June  Cleaver's household. The Beaver is divorced, with two children, and lives at  home with his widowed mom. On "The New Leave It to Beaver" June still wears  pearls, but she uses a Cuisinart, dates men and attends classes at the local  college.  </P> <P> More than style and story line separate these two TV series from the classic  originals they imitate: Both shows are in production a continent away from  their Hollywood roots -- in a town known more for souvenir shops than sound  stages.  </P> <P> Orlando Mayor Bill Frederick predicts that will change. He has told his  constituents that someday their city will become the Hollywood of the East. (In  one speech, he even joked -- or was it a joke? -- that in 50 years, people will  be referring to Hollywood as Orlando West.)  </P> <P> The local press has dutifully followed suit. Steve Martin's recent arrival on  the set of Ron Howard's "Parenthood" prompted Orlando magazine to breathlessly  boast that the city's "Hollywood East hopes have reached new heights. The  future is upon us." Orlando's ambitions have also drawn attention from national  news organizations such as NBC and Newsweek.  </P> <P> Others aren't so sanguine about Orlando's show-biz prospects. But Frederick's  remarks are more than flights of fancy: His vision for Orlando is based on the  very real $1-billion combined commitments that Disney and Universal Studios  have made to building production facilities and studio tours in Orlando. There  are also persistent rumors that Paramount is shopping for land in the area, but  a Paramount spokeswoman declined to comment.  </P> <P> Alongside "The New Mickey Mouse Club," which will debut April 24 on the Disney  Channel, the syndicated "Superboy" series is being produced at the Disney-MGM  Studios (the company is leasing the rights to the MGM name) just a stone's  throw from Disney World and Epcot Center. The feature film "Ernest Saves  Christmas" and the TV movie "Splash, Too" were filmed at Disney's Orlando  facilities, as well as TV shows such as "Win, Lose or Draw," "Siskel &amp;  Ebert" and a Carol Burnett special.  </P> <P> In February, the children's cable TV network Nickelodeon agreed to bring at  least 450 hours of original programming annually to Universal's Orlando  facility. Universal will begin production on the movie "Psycho IV" in Orlando  this spring. And "Parenthood," an Imagine Ent. film to be released by  Universal, is already shooting in town. "I probably will be back here," says  "Parenthood" director Ron Howard, who chose Orlando as a stand-in for the  story's setting, St. Louis, Mo. "The local talent pool will only improve."  </P> <P>  -- --  </P> <P> That's all great news for the locals, but can Orlando really ever rival  Hollywood? "Not in my lifetime," is the common response from studio executives  and public officials there. In his more serious moments, Frederick confesses,  "I don't think anyone is expecting Hollywood to surrender its crown."  Short-term, the mayor expects film and TV production to become one of his  city's four largest industries, alongside agriculture, tourism and high  technology.  </P> <P> The level of production in Orlando at this point is so tiny that it probably  equals the volume flowing through just four or five blocks of Sunset Boulevard.  Cathy Savino, who coordinates film production in three counties for the  privately funded Economic Development Commission, predicts that the Orlando  area will play host to $30 million in TV and film production this year.  </P> <P> In 1987, Florida captured $224 million worth of productions, compared to  California's $4.7 billion, the bulk of which landed in Southern California. Ben  Harris, chief of Florida's Motion Picture and Television Bureau, says his state  will be doing well if, within the next five years, its share of production  rises to $1 billion annually -- that's still only one-quarter of California's  current total.  </P> <P> Here's another telling fact: Universal, home to "The New Leave It to Beaver,"  now has four state-of-the-art sound stages. Sometime in the 1990s, that will  grow to 11 -- still only one-third the number that Universal now has on its  Southern California property. Disney has built three sound stages on its  property and has plans for more (how many, executives are not saying).  </P> <P> Both studios lease their sound stages and backlots to outsiders. "The intent  was to make them available to anyone," says Dan Slusser, general manager of  Universal Studios. Disney offers producers in-house costumers, technicians and  post-production facilities run by Hollywood's The Post Group. Universal has  brought in outside production support, so companies such as Panavision, Lee  Lighting and Polyeffects have set up shop on the property.  </P> <P> But just as it would be an exaggeration to call Orlando the next Hollywood, it  would be shortsighted to underestimate Orlando's threat to film and TV business  in Hollywood and elsewhere. The reason is this: Both Disney and Universal are  committed to ambitious studio tours in the area.  </P> <P> Disney's tour, which opens May 1, is built on 135 acres and features a backlot  with recreations of Hollywood Boulevard in the '30s and '40s, New York City's  brownstones and a residential neighborhood. The tour also includes "The Great  Movie Ride" and "Star Tours," a copy of the Disneyland ride. Universal's  444-acre attraction, opening next year, will make its L.A. tour look quaint by  comparison. Like Disney, Universal has a backlot with Hollywood and New York  landmarks. It also includes settings from San Francisco, Italy and a recreation  of the town of Amity -- the fictional beach community made infamous in "Jaws"  -- all set around a huge lagoon. The studio is building the two largest sound  stages in the world to house its "King Kong" and "E.T." rides. There will also  be a "Jaws" ride.  </P> <P> Because of their huge investments in these tourist attractions, both studios  have an interest in hyping Orlando as a next-generation Hollywood. It also  means that they will be scrambling to attract production to Orlando in the  future -- enough to give their tourists a behind-the-scenes peek at TV and the  movies seven days a week.  </P> <P> "The biggest money maker, no question, will be the tourist side," says Norman  R. Rice, vice president and studio manager at Universal's Orlando facility.  "The only way it makes sense to build more sound stages is because of the tour.  But, then, the Universal Studios tour only works because there is actual  production."  </P> <P> Ditto for Disney. Drawing production to Orlando is so important that even  Disney's most senior executives are soliciting business for the area. "One of  the key people who makes calls is a guy by the name of Michael Eisner," says  Disney's Ted Kaye, vice president for Orlando studio operations, referring to  the company's chief executive officer.  </P> <P> In addition to leasing its sound stage and production facilities, Disney is  promoting its 28,000 acres of land -- a parcel twice the size of Manhattan that  includes a nature preserve and a network of roads, as well as Disney World and  Epcot Center -- as a prime location for shooting.  </P> <P> Both Disney and Universal courted Nickelodeon when it began looking south to  consolidate its production. Universal wanted the business so badly that it  agreed to build Nickelodeon two custom-designed sound stages at no charge.  Nickelodeon doesn't even have to pay rent, just agree to film on the property  seven days a week, 52 weeks a year, during all hours of the tour's operation --  not a bad deal. "It's a dream come true, " said Geoffrey Darby, the channel's  senior vice president for production.  </P> <P> Nickelodeon's move underscores the role that Orlando is most likely to assume  over the next decade: What's good news for Orlando is bad news for Hollywood,  New York and other cities that have hosted Nickelodeon shows.  </P> <P> Rather than topple Hollywood, the more realistic scenario for Orlando is this:  It will increase the threat of production running away from California, whose  share of the feature film business has dropped from 80% to 70% in recent years;  it will grab much of the burgeoning cable TV business that might have gone to  L.A. or New York; it will lure away some of New York's lucrative TV commercial  business; and it will become a warm-weather alternative to Canada, where  producers have flocked in recent years to take advantage of cheaper labor costs  and a weak Canadian dollar.  </P> <P> "A lot of the industry will stay in Hollywood because of inertia," says Rice.  "But there will be a lot that don't want to put up with the traffic and the  (location) permit situation there. I think you will see a new production center  emerging in Orlando. There's a certain snobbishness among the people who say  that the only place to make a film is Hollywood."  </P> <P> Says Disney's Kaye: "For the foreseeable future, Orlando will develop into a  regional production center. It's not Hollywood East, it's Toronto South."  </P> <P>  -- --  </P> <P> Norm Rice looks out the window at the pouring rain, and then down at his watch.  "It was supposed to stop raining by 11," he says, a little dejected.  </P> <P> Locals like to think that weather is one of Orlando's biggest selling points.  But, in fact, the area is hot and muggy in the summer and subject to torrential  rains in the winter. (Disney even constructed its backlot to withstand  hurricanes.) One recent week, in March, was not a good advertisement for the  city -- wind, cold and ceaseless downpours repeatedly interrupted  "Parenthood's" outdoor scenes (which are supposed to take place on hot summer  days).  </P> <P> Savino advertises Orlando to producers as a town that "can look like Anywhere  USA." But, in fact, the terrain is relentlessly flat, without California's  mountains and deserts and beaches. And the city itself has the pristine  lifelessness of an industrial park.  </P> <P> A better advertisement for Orlando is hanging in the area's film commission  office. A take-off of the famous Hollywood sign that instead reads "Florida."  Underneath it says simply, "HOLLYWOOD WEATHER WITHOUT THE HOLLYWOOD OVERHEAD."  </P> <P> The Hollywood overhead to which the poster refers is the high cost of labor and  the headaches of permitting in California. Florida is a right-to-work state,  which means that unions cannot require individuals to join their ranks. For  producers, that policy is an invitation to hire non-union crews.  </P> <P> The downside, though, is that Florida crews generally are less experienced than  crews in unionized New York or California. "There's not that large of a talent  pool for crews -- it's just getting started, " says Doug Claybourne, who  produced "Ernest Saves Christmas" in Orlando.  </P> <P> Florida's right-to-work status is a sensitive topic, and both public officials  and studio executives downplay the savings of using Florida labor. "It's a  factor," Savino says. "But I don't think it's one of the main factors"  attracting production to Orlando.  </P> <P> "There are differences in labor rates," says Disney's Kaye. But he attributes  this to what he called staffing patterns. "In a union state there is this  rigidity of function. When you're in the sort of environment we're in, there's  this tremendous ability for interchange (among job assignments)."  </P> <P> But pay scales clearly are lower in the state, even among union workers. Frank  Ladeira, a union electrician working on the "Parenthood" set, said he makes  about one-third the New York rate. "Let's say in New York you make $30 an hour,  you come down here and it's $11 or $12," Ladeira said. Michael W. Proscia,  international vice president for the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage  Employers and Moving Picture Machine Operators (IATSE), agrees that even union  scales are "considerably lower" in Florida than in New York or California. In  addition, he noted that the Florida IATSE local 477 in Miami is more willing to  "make adjustments in working conditions."  </P> <P> "I believe (the environment for unions) is vastly improved," Proscia added.  "Employers realize that the unions are cooperative." Since the IATSE local in  Miami was founded in 1986, he said, "we've attempted to bring (scales) in line  with Hollywood agreements. "  </P> <P> State and union officials say they do not have figures on what percentage of  production in Florida uses non-union crews. But the Screen Actors Guild, which  boasts 4,000 Florida members -- the third-largest contingent behind California  and New York -- estimates that 90% of Florida productions work under a SAG  contract. And SAG rates are standardized nationwide, a guild spokesman said.  </P> <P> But for extras, the situation is bleaker. The Screen Extras Guild branch in  Miami has not been successful in making inroads, according to labor sources in  the state. "We have to pull teeth to get money for these people," says  Cassandra Carrigan, who runs one of Orlando's most successful talent agencies.  </P> <P> Moreover, Florida's child labor laws are weak, leaving few protections for  youngsters recruited as extras. During the recent filming of "Ernest Saves  Christmas," children were forced to wait on the set 10 to 12 hours before being  called for their parts, claims Carrigan, who represented many of the children  on that film. (Claybourne, the film's producer, said he wasn't aware of any  abuses and added that the film makers fully complied with local labor laws.  "Any time you have kids on a set, you take extra measures (to protect them),"  he added. )  </P> <P> Rather than focus on the labor climate, Orlando's boosters prefer to cite other  advantages to filming there: the cheap price of land in the area; a one-stop  permitting system for film producers; and the absence of a state income tax in  Florida. Moreover, locations are cheaper to rent, and they are not as overused  as they are in Southern California.  </P> <P> There's another reason the film industry likes Orlando: Its politicians are  nice, real nice.  </P> <P> When asked about his relationship to executives at the two Orlando studios,  Mayor Frederick walks over to his desk and pulls out a photo of himself with  Disney chief Michael Eisner. The two men recently marched in a parade together,  and Frederick always makes a point of seeing Eisner and most of the company's  senior management on his visits to L.A. (Disney is Florida's largest employer,  though Martin Marietta boasts the largest payroll.)  </P> <P> Frederick is also very friendly with top executives at Universal's parent  company, MCA, including chairman Lew Wasserman and his family. It's a delicate  matter, given the fiercely competitive atmosphere that has marred relations  between top management at Disney and Universal. "I try to be very discreet,"  Frederick says.  </P> <P> Recently, when Universal wanted to obtain a $3-million state grant for road  improvement on its property, "we helped out," says the mayor. When the  producers of "Leave It to Beaver" made a last-minute decision to shoot a scene  on a local road, they needed signatures from three county commissioners -- but  all of them were out of town. So a staffer in the commissioners' office drove  the permit 90 miles to where the officials were attending a meeting and got  their signatures.  </P> <P> Don't think for a minute that Universal isn't grateful for all this effort.  When Steven Spielberg, creative consultant to the Universal tour in Orlando,  was interviewed on national TV, he specifically mentioned Frederick. Not bad  exposure for any local official with political ambitions.  </P> <P> The warm feelings toward Hollywood studios extend up into the ranks of the  governor's office, where former Gov. Robert Graham eliminated sales tax for  film producers in the state and current Gov. Bob Martinez has maintained a  similarly friendly atmosphere. "The state of Florida, and the political leaders  of Florida, have always been very, very aggressive about courting the film  industry," says Universal's Slusser.  </P> <P> Disney doesn't have to worry about trivial matters like obtaining filming  permits. When Walt Disney decided to bring his amusement park east in the  1960s, he convinced state officials to give his company its own fiefdom, called  the Reedy Creek Improvement District. The district, which is exempted from  local land-use regulations, runs its own fire and police departments.  </P> <P> Disney uses that as a selling point with producers: When "Ernest Saves  Christmas" needed a road for a chase scene, for example, Disney simply shut  down its own roads. Didn't have to call a single bureaucrat.  </P> <P> Orlando's residents generally have approved of the welcome mat thrown out for  the studios. A anti-growth county commissioner who raised objections to favored  treatment for the studios, as well as to introducing new construction in the  area, was soundly defeated by the voters last fall. "Basically, it's hard to  oppose the movie industry; it's a good, clean industry," says Jane Healy,  associate editor of the Orlando Sentinel.  </P> <P>  -- --  </P> <P> It is fitting that "Beaver" and "The New Mickey Mouse Club" are among the first  regular productions on Orlando. Just as they are imitations of the real thing,  Orlando is fast becoming a clean, safe -- and artificial -- reproduction of  Hollywood, a town that invented itself, with all its elements of grunge and  glamour taking nourishment from show biz.  </P> <P> On their Orlando backlots, both Disney and Universal have painstakingly  recreated Hollywood's Brown Derby (with an accurate re-creation of the famous  restaurant's Cobb Salad, Disney boasts), Disney has built a Grauman's Chinese  Theater, and instead of the famed Thalberg Building in Culver City, Universal  is building a look-alike Spielberg Building in Orlando.  </P> <P> Florida almost became a movie production center. In 1916, Jacksonville played  host to more than 100 film companies, before they packed up and left for the  West Coast -- in part because local voters overwhelmingly elected anti-show  business candidates in the city's 1917 election. Later, in 1935, studio moguls  Louis B. Mayer of MGM and Joseph M. Schenck of 20th Century Fox publicly  threatened to move their studios to Florida after California's governor  proposed new taxes on their industry. Mayer said at the time that Florida had  agreed to exempt the movie industry from taxes for 15 years.  </P> <P> But instead of becoming home to the movie business, northern and central  Florida grew up to play host to the space program, New York retirees and Walt  Disney World. Despite its other industries, Orlando in central Florida is most  obviously a tourist town, a place where highway exit signs list first and  foremost the relevant amusement park -- an exit for Wet 'n Wild, for Disney  World, for Sea World, and on and on.  </P> <P> It's the sort of place where the locals view Steve Martin -- on location for  his starring role in "Parenthood" -- as one of the rides. "Because it's a  tourist town, people are used to having access to everything," says Martin,  whose every move seems to get reported in the local media. "It's not like New  York or L.A. . . . There's no etiquette. And you're expected to be friendly all  the time."  </P> <P> But tourism is why the studios are bringing production to Orlando in the first  place. Not only do their tours help defray the costs of film production, they  also provide ready audiences for game shows and live programming. By going to  Orlando, Nickelodeon gets a ready supply of children from all over the country  to fill in audiences or appear on its shows, as well as the opportunity to  raise its profile with the millions of families flowing through the Universal  tour each year.  </P> <P> And tourism makes Orlando a forgiving town for an intrusive industry. True, one  family living in the neighborhood where "Parenthood" was filming planted a sign  of protest over Universal's presence -- a relic of the fundamentalist protests  against the studio's "The Last Temptation of Christ." But most of those  neighbors gladly suffered through the rerouting of traffic and mobile homes  parked in their lawns and driveways.  </P> <P> "Everyone is pretty excited about it," says Sally McArthur, who lives across  the street from the house where "Parenthood" is filming. "Even people who were  hesitant at first. I have to walk down the street to get to my car. But that's  a small price to pay for a chance to rub elbows with major motion picture  stars."  </P> <P> "There's still a level of genuineness here, contrasted with some of the  cynicism you find in L.A.," says Disney's Kaye. "There is this enthusiasm and  excitement about a growing industry here. I'm too young to have been in the  golden age of television. But maybe something comparable is happening here."  </P> <P> Whether Orlando's enthusiasm for show business will survive the inconveniences  the industry inevitably brings remains to be seen. But for now the town is  welcoming Hollywood with open arms. A new AMC theater complex is equipped with  a circular driveway so limousines can arrive for movie premieres. And a local  producer is even trying to syndicate a TV show, called "Movie Lot Magazine," to  report on the stars who come to town.  </P> <P> Ancillary businesses -- such as equipment renters, prop houses and animal  trainers -- are springing up. Orlando is even experiencing the sleaze that  show-business necessarily seems to attract: In this case, fly-by-night talent  agencies that soak unsuspecting want-to-be's for several hundred dollars before  disappearing. "They're always just this side of the law, so we can't catch  them," says Savino.  </P> <P> The flatlands outside Jay Stein's office in Universal City, Calif., are jammed  with sound stages; to the right a steep hill flows up to the studio's tourist  attractions. Stein, now president of MCA's recreation services, started his  career in the company's mail room in 1959, when most of that land was  undeveloped and the fire department would bring in sheep every year to keep the  hillside brush from becoming a fire hazards.  </P> <P> The similarities between the San Fernando Valley then and Orlando now "are  frightening," Stein says, gazing into the distance. "I think Orlando will look  exactly like this someday, without the hill."  </P> <P> Orlando could very well grow up to look like parts of L.A., with film and TV  production facilities rivaling those in New York or Hollywood. But it's less  likely that Orlando will ever rob Hollywood of its glamour: In a business that  is built on status, Orlando does not rank high on the lists of preferred  locations. "We still have the significant volume here, and we have the  infrastructure," says Lisa Rawlins, director of California's film commission.  "It will take a long time to build that elsewhere.  </P> <P> "Is a producer or director or star going to want to go to Orlando to make a  movie? I don't know. . . . There's a difference between putting 'The Mickey  Mouse Club' or 'Leave It to Beaver' on a sound stage, and trying to get  (director) Larry Kasdan to make a movie down there."  </P> <P> But, for now at least, Orlando is going to try.  </P></p>

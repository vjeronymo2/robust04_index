			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Bonn/Cologne (DDP/ADN) -- The Federal Association  of German Industry (BDI) does not share Economic Affairs  Minister Guenter Rexrodt's positive assessment of medium-sized  business in eastern Germany. The situation of medium-sized  industry in the new federal states is still very volatile,  particularly in the sectors which face international  competition, the BDI said in Cologne on Wednesday [30 March].  Unfortunately there is as yet no question of a marked  improvement. The main problems are too high wage costs,  inadequate self-generated capital, and the difficulty of opening  up markets for sales.    Rexrodt said on the same day in Bonn that medium-sized  business in the east has successfully established itself and is  the main pillar of economic development. At present there are  440,000 self-employed people there, employing some 3 million  people. That is almost half the entire number of those employed  in eastern Germany. Manual trades, commerce, and services are  developing especially dynamically.    According to him, only 550,000 jobs are left of the original  2 million in industry. However, one can still not call this  deindustrialization, the minister stressed. Core industrial  areas have been preserved and there are certainly the beginnings  of new enterprise. Rexrodt said this process, described by the  BDI on several occasions as decimation, is the necessary and  inevitable acclimatization to the demands of the market economy.  [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>920325 FT  25 MAR 92 / Saudis to pay 37% less for petrol SAUDI ARABIA, already one of the world's cheapest places to fill up a car, has slashed domestic petrol prices by 37 per cent to the equivalent of 8.6 US cents a litre. The cut is one of several in services and utilities prices made in a surprise announcement by King Fahd to 'ease the burden of the cost of living on the citizens'. The move appears in part designed to soften the effects of inflation in the kingdom since the Gulf war, which has risen substantially in the past year in tandem with the general buoyancy of the economy. The price cuts certainly run counter to the government's general need to reduce expenditure, given that it is already slated to run an Dollars 8bn (Pounds 4.6bn) budget deficit for 1992 - its 10th successive budget shortfall. 'From the purely financial standpoint, it makes little sense,' said a Riyadh banker. Registration fees for businessmen and traders will be cut by up to 87 per cent and cuts will also be made on port tariffs and exit visas.</p>

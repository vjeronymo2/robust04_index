			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Muscle power of a NatWest arm THE Pounds 253m interim profit made by National Westminster Bank's securities and corporate lending arm, NatWest Markets, made it the bank's most profitable operating sector. The obvious question was voiced by Mr Martin Owen, its chief executive: 'Has it all been done by mirrors', he asked. That question translates into whether National Westminster has managed to establish a securities business to rival that of Barclays' BZW, or whether the figures were merely flattered by abnormal profits from foreign exchange and capital markets trading in six months of currency volatility. Mr Owen's answer was unsurprisingly that NatWest Markets is starting to establish a presence a year after he was appointed chief executive. If so, it is achieving a largely unknown feat by putting together NatWest's corporate banking for its 1,300 largest customers with a range of securities operations. It was hard to tell by the figures yesterday. The bank would only break down NatWest Markets' profits to the extent of saying that it had made strong dealing profits of Pounds 246m from higher volumes and wider spreads, and that its equities and venture capital operations had also done well. Furthermore, its lending contributed to a squeeze on the international net interest margin because it took on low margin assets in treasury operations. Yet Mr Owen insisted that there had been 'a step jump' in the business as it started to gain the benefits of integrated operation. This is a significant change for NatWest, which two years ago was uncertain of whether it would retain NatWest Securities, its broking business. It had suffered from publicity over County NatWest's involvement with Blue Arrow, and two Department of Trade and Industry inquiries. Mr Derek Wanless, NatWest's chief executive, said yesterday that NatWest Markets was 'more than exceeding the required return' from NatWest which is now to make a 17.5 per cent post-tax return. Even discounting the exceptional trading profits, he expects it to be above the barrier. In fact, staff were told yesterday that treasury profits were marginally higher than the last half of 1992, while capital markets had gained much more strongly. Equities moved back into profit after a second half loss, while profits in corporate finance fell from the same period. The crucial problem in investment banking that Mr Owen has been trying to address is that much of large corporate lending has been at too fine margins to be profitable. Banks have to persuade corporate customers to give them other business such as debt and equity raising, or treasury, to make money. Mr Owen said that NatWest Markets now has systems in place that allow it to calculate the overall value of customer relationships. 'Of course, it is impossible to get down to the last penny in things like foreign exchange trading, but we broadly know that we are in the right ball park,' he said. In practice, this review has produced some shocks. Mr Owen estimates that only 800 of 1,300 large corporates are clearly producing healthy profits. He is working on the other 500 to raise earnings. He talks of 'appalling' one large customer by showing quite how unprofitable the business was. NatWest Markets has a stiff task in producing the required capital returns because 31.5 per cent of the bank's Pounds 106.5bn risk-weighted assets are attached to the business. This means that it will have to continue to produce high non-interest income to make sure that lending is worthwhile. However, Mr Owen believes that NatWest Markets' capacity for distribution of loan and equity capital through its large securities operation will beat smaller competitors. The bank's size may require large returns, but it can also be used to throw some weight around in an overcrowded market.</p>

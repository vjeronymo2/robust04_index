			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Jean Dupont: "Thomson-CSF Is Going to Buy Out </F> Hughes Rediffusion"--first paragraph is AIR &amp; COSMOS/AVIATION  MAGAZINE INTERNATIONAL introduction]    [Text] Thomson-CSF [Thomson-General Radio Company] is  getting to be the number-two manufacturer of civil aircraft  simulators after CAE [computer aided engineering] and the  number-one manufacturer of military simulators in England.    Unless we hear otherwise from the British and European  commissions on competition, Thomson-CSF is going to buy out its  rival, Hughes Rediffusion Simulation, before the end of the  year. This is the result of the agreement signed last week  between the French electronics combine and Hughes Aircraft. The  agreement also involves two other subsidiaries: Hughes AMI,  which manufactures simulated instrument panel instruments, and  Hughes Rediffusion Simulation, Inc., which ensures marketing and  after-sales service in the United States. On the other hand, the  British training subsidiary, British Caledonian Flight Training,  and Rediffusion's air control simulator operations are excluded  from the agreement.    Based in Crawley near Gatwick, England, Rediffusion has  never  recovered from its heavy investments in the late eighties to  launch a new series of civil aircraft simulators, "Concept 90."  This warhorse had been completely rethought in order to optimize  its maintenance and operation. But its designer, who relied on  his position as the second largest manufacturer of civil  simulators in the world and his 70 percent share of the visual  display unit market, could not see the air transport crisis  coming. The Canadian CAE, which is number one in the industry,  could not see it either since it was enlarging its plant in  Montreal at the same time to double its production capacity.    This was followed by a price war that caused prices to  plunge  25 percent and in the course of which CAE was struggling with  modernized means of production while Rediffusion had to bear the  burden of paying off its R &amp; D investments. In 1990  Rediffusion  staggered under the blow initially and laid off a third of its  3,000 employees. At the end of last year a new restructuring  plan resulted in the departure of 600 more employees. And a  third plan is probably at present being prepared. All of these  efforts have not enabled them to avoid the way out of a takeover  by Thomson-CSF.    A Thomson-CSF that has a solid base established on the basis  of the Airbus simulators and that benefits from that aircraft  manufacturer's breakthrough. Thomson-CSF acquired a third  position in the civil aircraft market in 1990 by buying out  Link-Miles in England, one of the divisions of the Singer-Link  empire, which was at the time dismantled by the raider,  Bilzerian. Thomson-CSF knew how to profit from the joint  ventures with its new subsidiary, which was operating in the  Boeing markets.    We can no longer say as much for this new buyout. Because,  in  the meantime, Thomson-CSF and Link-Miles have developed a new  visual display unit, "Space," for civil and military simulators  and taken on the emergent market for FTD (flight training  devices), instruction systems that are inserted between the  computer-assisted learning unit and the flight simulator; two  gaps in the market that the Rediffusion series addresses.    Louis Le Porte, who has been constantly insisting that there  is an overcapacity of civil aircraft simulators since he took  over control of the Thomson-CSF Training Systems and Simulation  Division two years ago, is now directly confronted with the  problem. Because the world market has been reduced to a small  figure of about 20 units while CAE's capacity and Thomson-CSF's  in its new field of operations is 45 simulators a year!    With this conglomeration of companies, Thomson-CSF has  doubled its share of the civil flight simulator market,  estimated at Fr3 billion. With 40 percent of all sales, it is  behind CAE, which has captured 50 percent of the market. As for  the military market, it essentially continues to be segmented by  country. But in retaining Link-Miles and Rediffusion,  Thomson-CSF becomes the biggest manufacturer of military  simulators in England with nearly three-fourths of the market.</p>

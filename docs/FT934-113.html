			<p>931231 FT  31 DEC 93 / Late concessions clear way for Israeli budget Israel's parliament was last night expected to approve a Shk126.5bn (Pounds 28.6bn) budget for 1994, up from Shk103bn this year, after last-minute concessions to various political parties. The budget provides for a deficit of Shk7.6bn - or 3 per cent of gross domestic product - which the government says will be met by the sale of shares in government-owned companies (expected to raise Shk4.6bn next year) and foreign loans, including use of US soft loan guarantees worth Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.3bn) a year. Last year's deficit was 3.2 per cent of GDP. The government says its strategy of moving away from borrowing in the local capital market will create a long-term environment for lower interest rates and better incentives for investment. However, on the eve of the budget's passage the Bank of Israel raised interest rates to curb inflation, expected to rise to 11.5 per cent next year. The prime lending rate will climb from 11 to 11.8 per cent. The move was criticised by the ministry of finance, which said the only way to fight inflation was to take measures to bring down housing costs. Before yesterday's Knesset debate the government fought a tough battle to secure the necessary parliamentary support. Some Labour MPs insisted on big changes in the social welfare provisions for the elderly and the poor and threatened to vote down the budget unless their demands were met. Other concessions were made to the ultra-orthodox Shas and Agudah parties and to MPs from Arab parties. Under the budget, government investment in infrastructure will increase by 15 per cent next year. The rise is primarily absorbed by doubling expenditure on roads to Shk1.8bn and increasing the education budget by 25 per cent from Shk8bn to Shk10bn. The defence budget is set at Shk20.2bn, including foreign aid, and is expected to drop 3-4 per cent by the end of the decade. The government proposes a number of taxation changes, including a gradual lowering of corporate tax from 39 per cent to 36 per cent in 1996 and an adjustment of income tax rates to a maximum of 50 per cent, with cuts focused on the middle-income bracket. Tax revenues are expected to increase 9 per cent in real terms. Inflation is forecast to drop to 8 per cent from 10.4 per cent, unemployment will be reduced to 9.4 per cent from 10.2 per cent and GDP will grow 5.3 per cent, against 3.5 per cent for 1993.</p>

			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / India growth set to miss targets India's industrial growth is likely to register an increase of 4.5 per cent in 1994-95, falling short of the government target of 6 to 7 per cent despite a sharp rise in exports, according to a report yesterday by a Bombay-based research centre, writes Shiraz Sidhva in New Delhi. This is still an improvement on last year's figure of 3.5 per cent. The Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE), an independent research organisation, said in its half-year economic outlook that real gross domestic product growth would improve marginally to 4.2 per cent against the government's estimate of 5 per cent. It estimated GDP growth in the year toMarch 1994 as 3.5 per cent compared with the official estimate of 3.8 per cent. Farm output growth is expected to increase to 3 per cent, compared with last year's 1.8 per cent, because of a good monsoon season. Inflation would be contained at less than 10 per cent from the recent 11 per cent high. Exports are expected to grow 15 per cent this year, down from last year's 18 per cent.</p>

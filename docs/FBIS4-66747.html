			<p>Strategy   on Foreign Investment Reviewed   <F P=102> 94AS0266A Karachi JANG in Urdu 14 Apr 94 p 3 </F> <F P=103> 94AS0266A </F> <F P=104>  Karachi JANG </F> <F P=105>  Urdu </F> CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Dr. Maqsood Anwar: "Government's New Strategy </F> and Foreign Investments"]    [Text] According to one report, our government has  clarified a new policy for foreign investment in our country.  According to this policy, Arab nations will be given a  preferential status for investing money here over Western  nations. The Investment Promotion Bureau [IPB] and the  Investment Board [IB] will be made more effective. The  government plans to pay more attention to agricultural  industries. In order to attract foreign investors, investment  centers will be established in the embassies and here in  Pakistan. Various conferences and seminars will be held in  countries that show interest in investing in Pakistan.    The wrong policies and plans of former governments, foreign  investment in Pakistan was not encouraged enough and not much  attention was given to it. Each of our governments had tried to  get money from the West, however, our planner forgot that the  interests of the Western nations have nothing to do with our own  interests. The Western nations look for ways to interfere in our  internal affairs under the guise of investing here and they find  various ways to put political pressure on us. For example, the  United States has suspended military and economic aid to  Pakistan. Its condition is that Pakistan must freeze its nuclear  program. It is not willing to impose this condition on India and  wants to put all these restriction on Pakistan alone. When the  Western nations fail to realize their political and economic  interests, they break their promises and stop their aid. The  United States has also restricted Pakistan's exports and has  imposed major restrictions on our textiles production. The same  is true for other Western nations. Even some Asian countries  under U.S. influence are treating Pakistan similarly. The  Western nations impose strict requirements for investing money.  They try to make the developing countries the markets for their  products and do not import products from these developing  nations.    We should have paid attention to it a long time ago, because  we not only have trade and economic relations with Arab nations,  we also have historical, religious, cultural, and social  relations with them. The Arab nations do not insist on imposing  strict rules for investing money like the Western nations do.  All they want is security of their capital. In exchange, they  will take interest in purchasing Pakistani products. The Arab  nations have a great demand for agricultural products. The  present government has shown far-sight by including Arab  investors in agricultural industries. Most of the Arab nations  are not self-sufficient in growing food grains. The Arab  investment will help develop our agricultural industry and the  export of agricultural products to Arab nations will prove a  boon for us. Our agricultural production will be exported to  friendly Arab nations. This will increase our exports and the  food grains need of the Arab nations will also be met. The Nawaz  Sharif government had also tried to give special entitlement to  foreign investors and also held a major seminar here. A large  number of European investors had participated in that seminar,  however, there were no concrete results. Some reasons for  limited foreign investment in Pakistan are our bureaucratic  rules and regulations, shortage of electric power, and the  problem of law and order. The program that our government has  formulated for luring Arab investors should pay special  attention to alleviating the problem of shortage of electric  power. It is a common complaint that our trade attaches in other  countries do not pay attention to it, although it is their duty  to look for new sources of investment and increase our trade.    We need cooperation from trade and industrial circles to  hold  conferences and seminars in Arab countries for attracting their  investment. To this end, first we should send deputations of  experts to these countries to establish individual relations  with the investors there. We must establish centers in these  countries to encourage investments and a regular advertising  campaign should also be started. It would be better to invite  Arab investors to visit Pakistan and present to them details of  agricultural areas in which they can benefit. The government  should review old reports on plans for attracting foreign  investment and find out the reasons for the failure of those  plans. Until these problems are alleviated, neither will success  in this area be possible nor can we make better plans.</p>

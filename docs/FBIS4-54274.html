			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Hiroyuki Akita] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 24 May -- Japan and China started the  first two-day negotiation meeting in Beijing on 23 May to talk  abut the possibility of China becoming a member of GATT. As a  condition for China to Join the GATT, Japan had called for a  reduction of tariff rates on 3,300 industrial goods and China  gave answers on 2,800 items. However, it seems that both  countries need more time before reaching an agreement because,  "there still exists a big gap" between their proposals  (according to the Japanese negotiation team).    It will be the first full-fledged negotiation meeting  between  the two countries regarding China's joining GATT.</p>

			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / International Company News: Finnish steel group's global share offering aims to attract FM800m Rautaruukki, the Finnish steel group, yesterday announced plans to raise around FM800m (Dollars 144m) through a global share offering which will strengthen its balance sheet and reduce state ownership. The issue is one of the largest in Finland's programme to widen ownership of state-owned companies, and will cut the state's holding in the group to 70 per cent from 81 per cent. Proceeds will be used to reduce debt and will increase Rautaruukki's equity to assets ratio to about 30 per cent from 22.8 per cent at the end of 1993. The group is offering 16m shares in two tranches. Around 65 per cent of the issue will be directed at Finnish and international institutions, and the remainder at the US market. Pricing will not be fixed until the end of this month, but will be based on market value of the shares, which was FM52 yesterday. The new offer follows the group's success last year in raising FM320m through a share issue which cut state ownership to 81 per cent from 87 per cent. It has been timed to take advantage of the company's improving financial performance and an upturn in Scandinavian demand. Rautaruukki is one of Europe's few profitable steelmakers after returning to the black with a FM144m surplus after financial items last year. It has benefited from the low value of the Finnish markka, increased efficiency and higher steel prices. A further improvement in earnings has been forecast for this year, with turnover set to rise to FM8bn from FM7bn. The group, Scandinavia's second biggest steel producer after Sweden's SSAB, concentrates on flat steel products. Parliamentary authorisation allows the state to reduce its stake in Rautaruukki to 50.1 per cent, suggesting further share issues will be made. CS First Boston is lead manager of the global offering and sole manager of the US tranche. Prospectus, Kansallis-Osake-Pankki and Merrill Lynch International are co-lead managers of the international tranche.</p>

			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / UK Company News: James Beattie dips on interest setback James Beattie, the Wolver-hampton-based department store group, yesterday reported a 4 per cent decline in annual profits as falling interest rates led to a sharp contraction in investment income. Sales, excluding VAT, in the 12 months to January 31 improved 6.4 per cent to Pounds 79.4m reflecting the opening of the Aylesbury store in September and a full year contribution from the Worcester store. Sales growth from comparable space was just 2 per cent. Sir Eric Pountain, chairman, said the growth was achieved without sacrificing gross margins. 'This should be judged against a background which has seen a continuation of trading pressures . . . with little sign of sustained economic recovery.' The trading climate remained 'highly competitive' Sir Eric added, with customer confidence remaining at a low level. Despite capital expenditure during the year of Pounds 5.4m, the group's cash pile increased to Pounds 25m. Investment income and interest, however, fell some 35 per cent to Pounds 1.23m (Pounds 1.89m) and left pre-tax profits at Pounds 6.56m (Pounds 6.83m). Earnings per share emerged at 9.3p (9.8p). A recommended final dividend of 4.7p lifts the total for the year to 6.2p (6p).</p>

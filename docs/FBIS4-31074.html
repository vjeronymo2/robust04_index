			<p>BFN     [Text] The Albanian authorities have arrested 25 citizens  of the FRY charged with organized smuggling of oil across Skadar  Lake. Those arrested belong to a group of Montenegrins from  Zeta who were shipping oil to Montenegro. The Albanian  authorities arrested them after supervision of cross-border  traffic was stepped up in line with UN observers' demands. As  of Friday Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia  -- FYROM] had also stepped up customs control measures,  especially concerning fuel.</p>

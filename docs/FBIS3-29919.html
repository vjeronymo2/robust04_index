			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, February 23 (KCNA) -- The U.S.  imperialists Monday committed an aerial photographing and  electronic reconnaissance on the strategic depth and inland  areas of the DPRK with an Okinawa-based RC-135 strategic  reconnaissance plane in the skies above Pochon, Yanggu and  Kansong, South Korea, along the Military Demarcation Line,  military sources said.    That day large-calibre artillery units and armed bandits of  the South Korean puppet army incited a war atmosphere, firing  hundreds of bullets and shells in the areas adjacent to the  demilitarized zone in Yonchon, Paju and Chorwon Counties, and  formations of helicopter gunboats and transports of the puppet  army staged an exercise of support and transport for ground  attack units.    The war racket of the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean  puppets is a vicious challenge to the unanimous desire of the  Korean people and the world's peaceloving people for peace and  reunification of Korea.</p>

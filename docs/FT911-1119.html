			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / Azerbaijan accuses Armenia of waging war THE Soviet republic of Azerbaijan yesterday accused Armenian nationalists of 'waging an undeclared war' and said guerrillas had killed 65 Azerbaijanis before a Soviet army clampdown last week. In a statement carried by the official news agency Tass, the Azerbaijani Foreign Ministry warned Armenia's leadership that it would have to carry 'full responsibility' for any further aggression. The statement, which came a day after Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev defended the use of troops against Armenian villages inside Azerbaijan, continued: 'Further hostilities against Azerbaijan will produce a catastrophe.' It stated that between April 28 and May 3, Armenian guerrillas had shelled or opened fire on more than 30 Azerbaijani villages and the towns of Shusha and Kazakh. Armenia, meanwhile, yesterday accused President Gorbachev and the Kremlin of unleashing a campaign of state terrorism to topple the republic's elected nationalist government. Mr Levon Ter-Petrosyan, Armenian president, said military operations, including attacks by helicopters and armoured vehicles, were continuing against isolated Armenian villages. He said dozens had been killed. Police from Azerbaijan were also taking part in the attacks, he said. The Soviet leadership blames armed Armenian nationalist groups for the violence and insist they be disarmed. Mr Ter-Petrosyan quoted witness who were reported as saying that combined Soviet and Azerbaijani forces had committed atrocities against Armenians in the border region, including the shooting of prisoners and the scalping of dead bodies. The allegations were impossible to corroborate from independent sources. 'President Gorbachev says these actions are only intended to neutralise armed (Armenian) groups. But he has another goal,' a subdued Mr Ter-Petrosyan told a news conference. Mr Gorbachev wanted 'to terrorise the Armenian people and overthrow the legally-elected powers in Armenia.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Tania Monteiro] </F>   [Text] Brasilia -- The future Brazilian president-elect  already has an official engagement scheduled for 9-10 December:  to attend the Summit of the Americas in Miami. Responding to  U.S. President Bill Clinton's invitation, President Itamar  Franco has stated that he will attend the meeting with his  successor. In remarks to O ESTADO, President Franco said: "By  then I will be in the final stage of my tenure and I believe the  president-elect should go with me." He stated that he would  invite his successor "whoever he might be."    Franco has already set a date for leaving Alvorada Palace:  30  September; that is, prior to the first round of the elections.  He said: "I want to leave the palace at that time to make it  available for the president-elect to use for meetings during the  transition period." He noted that in this way the palace could  be thoroughly cleaned in time for its new resident.    Although he still has eight months in office, Franco is  already dreaming of more peaceful days at Planalto Palace. For  instance, he mentioned that his youngest daughter, Fabiana, will  graduate in Economics by the end of this year. He is convinced  that her graduation ceremony will not be as hectic as that of  his daughter Georgeana from Law School late last year. Franco  said: "Everyone will be thinking about the new president and no  one will be chasing after me." He added: "At the end of your  term, only the wind knocks on your door."    Franco hopes to leave the government with a low inflation  rate. He believes prices will drop soon. He believes time will  help overcome the resistance observed in some sectors to the  FHC2 [Fernando Henrique Cardoso-2] Plan. This would help  Cardoso -- his presidential candidate -- qualify for the second  round.</p>

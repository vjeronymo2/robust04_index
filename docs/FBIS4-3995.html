			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 27 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-Premier  and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen offered his condolences here  this morning on the unfortunate death of former U.S. President  Richard Nixon, who made important contributions to the  improvement and growth of Sino-U.S. ties.    Today the U.S. Embassy was filled with a solemn silence.  Wreaths presented by Chinese President Jiang Zemin, Premier Li  Peng, Vice-Premiers Zhu Rongji and Qian Qichen as well as State  Councillor and Secretary-General of the State Council Luo Gan  were placed in the mourning hall of the U.S. Embassy. A portrait  of Nixon draped with black gauze was hung on the wall in the  hall.    At about 9:30 A.M. Qian and Luo slowly walked into the  embassy and shook hands with U.S. Ambassador to China J.  Stapleton Roy, expressing their deep condolences on Nixon's  death.    They stood silently in front of a portrait of the deceased  for a while and then each wrote a few words of commemoration in  a mourning book.    Qian's inscription read, "During the time he served as U.S.  president, Mr. Nixon opened the door to Sino-U.S. relations and  made historic contributions." Luo's inscription expressed his  deep condolences and sent his best regards to Nixon's family and  relatives.    Also on hand were Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs Jiang  Enzhu, Vice-Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of China's  National People's Congress Zhu Qizhen, Vice-Minister of the  State Sports Commission Liu Ji and Lu Yucheng, vice-mayor of  Beijing.    Nixon died of a major stroke on the evening of April 22 at  the Cornell Medical Center in New York at the age of 81.    He had always been keen in Sino-U.S. relations and visited  China on seven occasions. During his presidency he opened the  door to Sino-U.S. relations together with the late Chairman Mao  Zedong and the late Premier Zhou Enlai, thus opening up a new  phase in bilateral ties.</p>

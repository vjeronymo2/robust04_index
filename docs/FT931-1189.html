			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading STOCK index futures maintained a healthy premium to the underlying cash market throughout the day in spite of a sharp retreat brought about by a sell programme in the first half of the session, writes Joel Kibazo. Having opened at 2,867, the March contract moved sharply ahead to 2,875 on news that the Bundesbank had cut its interest rate on its 3-day Treasury bills to 7.5 per cent. That momentum quickly faded as dealers instead focused on the big sell programme, said to have come from UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. This led to persistent selling of the contract and the June contract recorded a low of 2,840 for the day. The firm opening in New York, together with sizeable buying from a leading US house helped the June contract to recover. There was a 10-20 point premiumfor most of the day and the June contract closed at 2,870, 3 points below its close on Wednesday and 13 points above its estimated fair value to cash of around 9 points. Turnover was around 10,000 contracts. Dealings in traded options were quite heavy and volume closed at 41,576 lots. Some 6,348 contracts were dealt in the FT-SE 100 option and 3,059 in the Euro FT-SE 100 option. Among the stock options, Dixons led the way with 2,136 contracts and was followed by Prudential at 1,981 lots.</p>

Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment requests involve no significant hazards consideration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Local Public Document Room location: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Maud Preston Palenske Memorial Library, 500 Market Street, St. Joseph, Michigan 49085.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Attorney for licensee: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Gerald Charnoff, Esq., Shaw, Pittman, Potts and Trowbridge, 2300 N Street, NW, Washington, DC 20037.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> NRC Project Director: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Ledyard B.

The proposed changes do not modify the response of the containment during a design basis accident. The proposed amendment does not add or modify any existing equipment. The proposed Types A, B, and C testing schedules will be consistent with Appendix J to 10 CFR 50. Based on these considerations, it is concluded that the changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 --> Criterion 2  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed changes do not involve physical changes to the plant or changes in plant operating configuration. The proposed changes only remove the restrictive schedular requirements for conducting Type A testing from the T/Ss and substitute the schedule specified in Appendix J to 10 CFR 50. For Types B and C testing, the schedular requirements are removed from T/Ss because they are already specified in Appendix J to 10 CFR 50. Thus, it is concluded that the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 --> Criterion 3  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The margin for safety presently provided is not reduced by the proposed change in the schedular requirements for Type A tests. Types B and C schedular requirements are not changed by removing them from T/Ss. Although the changes allow more flexibility in scheduling Type A tests, the proposed amendment continues to ensure reactor containment system reliability by periodic testing in full compliance with 10 CFR 50, Appendix J. Based on these considerations, it is concluded that the changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

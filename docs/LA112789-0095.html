			<p><P> November 27, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PREP REVIEW;  </P> <P> CENTURY TO UNVEIL GYMNASIUM FRIDAY  </P> <P> The classiest of Orange County high school basketball facilities will see its  first basketball action Friday afternoon when the Century High School boys'  freshmen and sophomore basketball teams play their season openers against  Fullerton.  </P> <P> Century, located in Santa Ana, is Orange County's newest high school. It will  unveil its $20,000 four-sided drop-down scoreboard in the 2,500-seat campus  gymnasium at a half-hour ceremony Friday at 2 p.m. before the sophomore game.  The freshman game will follow.  </P> <P> "The gym facility is probably, if not the best, one of the best in the state  for high schools," said Century basketball Coach Greg Coombs, who left a  successful program at Santa Ana High for the Century job.  </P> <P> Southern Section officials already have inquired about using the facility in  the future for the small schools or 1-A playoffs, he said.  </P> <P> "You walk into the second level and walk down to the bleachers," said Coombs,  who led Santa Ana to the semifinals of the Southern Section 4-A Division last  season. 'We are going to have seats right along courtside like they do at the  Forum," Coombs said.  </P> <P> The game will be broadcast on KYOU Channel 26 in Santa Ana.  </P> <P> "It is just going to be a great event and it is something the whole school will  remember for many years to come," Coombs said.  </P> <P> Raising Roof-Raisers Right: Century students will receive instruction in more  than reading, writing, arithmetic and now, computer literacy.  </P> <P> This week, the students will be learning something a bit more spirited -- the  proper way to cheer.  </P> <P> "These kids are freshmen and sophomores," Coombs said. "A lot of these kids are  just coming out of junior high, so the majority haven't been to a big game.  </P> <P> "We want them to get the full effect of what it is like being part of a  big-time event."  </P> <P> The school has a daily 15-minute advisement class students attend. During that  time, students and teachers discuss everything from how to be a better person  to how to get into college. But this week, in honor of the basketball team's  season opener, the students will be learning how to express their school  spirit.  </P> <P> They will show off their cheers and spirit at Friday's pregame ceremony, which  will include such activities as shot contests for prizes.  </P> <P> "The kids are having a face-painting contest at the school like they do in the  colleges," Coombs said. 'We are trying to make it just like a college event  would be.  </P> <P> "It is building both self-esteem in the kids and pride in their school."  </P> <P> Don't Forget The Three Rs: Ten of the 12 members on Century's sophomore team  have a 3.0 or better grade-point average, Coombs said.  </P> <P> "More than anything else," he said, "more than this game or this gym, that  pleases us more than anything -- that academically they are doing the job."  </P> <P> No Regular Rusher: Rancho Alamitos High School's Dana Riddle, Orange County's  regular-season rushing leader with 1,975 yards, also led the state in that  category.  </P> <P> In addition, he broke the all-time state record for most carries in the regular  season. He carried 374 times to better Rene Barton's record of 320, set in 1983  while Barton played at Whittier Christian.  </P> <P> The all-time state regular-season rushing record, held by Whittier Christian's  Craig Johnston, is safe, though. Johnston gained 2,445 yards in only nine games  in 1975. The record was set at the old Whittier Christian campus in Whittier,  before the school opened its La Habra campus, so it is not an Orange County  record. The county record was set by Servite's Derek Brown, who rushed for  2,301 yards in 1988.  </P> <P> Riddle took control of this season's rushing race in the eighth week, when he  gained 344 yards against Pacifica. That same week, his primary competitor, Mark  Hatzenbuhler of Halt High School in Sacramento, had only two carries for  minus-four yards after he was ejected for fighting.  </P> <P> Hatzenbuhler finished third in the state with 1,770 yards in 244 carries. La  Puente's Marshawn Thompson of Bassett High School was second with 1,918 yards  in 304 carries.  </P> <P> Sibling Rivalry: Jerry Wulf, 31, and his brother Rainer, 29, have always loved  to compete. Not so much against each other, however, because they played  different sports.  </P> <P> The brothers might just be the first fraternal siblings to coach their teams to  Southern Section titles.  </P> <P> Last spring, Rainer led Trabuco Hills to the Southern Section 3-A basketball  championship. Last week, Jerry led South Pasadena to a 14-8 victory over La  Serna in the Southern Section 2-A water polo championships.  </P> <P> Jerry's victory was important in the good-natured battle between the brothers  over which sport is better. Especially since it might sway one of their nieces  or nephews to take up water polo.  </P> <P> "He always wants them to be water polo players and I want them to be basketball  players," Rainer said.  </P> <P> The brothers got involved in swimming early. Jerry decided to stick with  swimming and water polo, playing the latter at Cal State Los Angeles. Rainer  opted for basketball, playing at UC Irvine.  </P></p>

			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / Government Bonds: Strike settlement hopes underpin German rally GERMAN government bonds moved higher yesterday, encouraged for the second successive day by hopes of a settlement in the dispute between employers and striking public sector workers. The bund futures contract on Liffe, the London exchange, closed at 87.39, up from an opening level of 87.14, and only just below the high point of the day of 87.44. Volume was heavy at 95,000 contracts. Talks between public sector workers and employers broke up with the unions considering an improved pay offer, believed to be worth around 5.6 per cent. The government had offered 4.8 per cent, against the union's claim of 9.5 per cent. However, even if the public sector pay dispute is settled, industrial action in other areas of the economy looks likely. IG Metall, the powerful industrial union, said 65,000 of its members joined a three-hour stoppage yesterday in pursuit of higher pay. FRENCH government bonds pushed strongly higher, as the government moved to ease credit conditions by cutting bank reserve requirements. In the morning session, prices were weaker as investors took profits following a strong  1/2 -point rally on Wednesday. The Bank of France disappointed some dealers by keeping intervention rates unchanged at 9.6 per cent in regular money market operations. The authorities also drained FFr4.5bn from the money market. However, the announcement that bank reserve deposits with the central bank had been cut allowed commercial banks to reduce base lending rates by around a  1/2 point, to 9.85 per cent. The benchmark 8 1/2 per cent OAT maturing 2002 rose strongly on the news, closing on a yield of 8.62 per cent, from 8.68 per cent at the opening. The yield spread between the French and German markets at the 10-year maturity closed from 70 basis points to 68 basis points. THE UK government bond market traded within a narrow range, following trends in continental European markets in the absence of new domestic factors. The 9 per cent gilt maturing 2011 closed up just  1/32 of a point on the day at 99 23/32 , for a yield of 9.02 per cent. On Liffe, trading volume in the June gilt futures contract was extremely light at 5,000 contracts. The June future opened at 98.20 and traded down to 98.11 during the morning, before recovering in the afternoon to close at 98.22. One factor helping to support prices was the strength of sterling on the foreign exchange markets. The UK currency rose from DM2.925 at the close on Wednesday to around DM2.94 by late afternoon yesterday. However, analysts said there was uncertainty over the future direction of UK interest rates. The outcome of the current round of German pay negotiations and the monetary policy set by the Bundesbank would determine whether UK rates can come down again. The Bank of England said it sold all of the Pounds 800m tap issue of 8 3/4 per cent gilts maturing 1997 announced on Friday. US TREASURY prices drifted lower in a second consecutive session dominated by afternoon Treasury auctions. In late trading, the Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond was  3/8 lower at 99 31/32 , yielding 7.997 per cent. There was some profit-taking after the afternoon sale of Dollars 10bn of 30-year bonds in the last leg of the Treasury's Dollars 36bn refunding auction. There was strong bidding for the long bonds, which had an average yield of 8 per cent and a bid-to-cover ratio of 2.48 to 1. On Wednesday, bond prices moved higher after a successful auction of Dollars 11bn of 10-year notes. The Federal Reserve did not intervene in the open market. Fed Funds were quoted at 3 per cent during the Fed's usual intervention period. As well as this week's refunding auctions, the market is concerned with today's release of employment data for April. There was little reaction to the release of jobless claims for the week ended April 30. JAPANESE government bond prices rose, encouraged by a 532-point rise in the Nikkei index and favourable terms on the latest auction of 10-year government paper. The benchmark 10-year government bond issue No 129 closed the Tokyo day on a yield of 5.6 per cent, from 5.635 per cent on Wednesday. Traders were relieved that the latest Y800bn issue of government paper carries a 5.7 per cent coupon, in line with current market yields. Last week the market sold off on fears the authorities would issue the 5.5 per cent stock unpopular with institutional investors.</p>

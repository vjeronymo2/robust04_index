			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Changes benefit retail investors - Derivatives Individual investors will benefit most from the Chancellor's efforts to clarify the tax treatment of some futures and options products. Under the changes announced in the Budget, investors buying an options contract for which they make an upfront payment called a 'premium', will be able to offset the cost of this against capital gains tax. This applies to cash-settled options bringing them into line with rules that already apply to similar instruments. Futures industry officials say this takes away a current disincentive for individual investors to invest in derivatives, but is not likely in itself to entice waves of new investors into the industry. In addition, the chancellor announced a review of the taxation of interest in an attempt to remove anomalies between the treatment of derivatives and their underlying instruments. Other measures taken in the derivatives sector were largely technical clarifications of the treatment by companies of foreign exchange and futures and options gains and losses in advance of new regulations which are due to be published later in December. 'This is a very sensible move and reduces risk for the professional operator, but it is not going to encourage retail investors to use options until they can understand them,' said Mr Charles Fry, chairman of Johnson Fry, which runs a Pounds 4m futures fund.</p>

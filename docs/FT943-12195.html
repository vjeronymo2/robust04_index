			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Dealers in derivatives reported a dull and uneventful session which resulted in directionless trading and poor turnover, writes Joel Kibazo. Traders pointed to the begining of school holidays and the start of today's rail strikes among reasons for the poor day in the market. Having started trading at 3,116, the September futures contract on the FT-SE 100 drifted lower over the next few hours on the back of UK Gilts that were trading easier ahead of tomorrow's auction. The underlying cash market followed September lower though dealing activity remained very thin indeed. The recovery in gilts together with a squeeze in the last hour of trading brought a turnaround in September. Moving strongly ahead, it touched a peak of 3,128 just ahead of the close, before finishing at 3,127, in line with Friday's close and at a 24 point premium to cash. Volume at 7,478 was very poor. Activity in the traded options was equally poor and turnover at the close was a mere 18,943 lots, against Friday's total of 41,178 contracts. The contribution from the index options was 5,183 lots dealt in the FT-SE 100 option and 2,421 in the Euro FT-SE option. J Sainsbury was the most active stock option with Kleinwort Benson said to have carried out a 'roll-over' trade in the stock. Its closing volume was 1,717.</p>

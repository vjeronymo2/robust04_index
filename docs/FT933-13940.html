			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / UK Company News: NatWest Bancorp at Dollars 70m as recovery gathers pace NATWEST Bancorp, the US retail banking subsidiary of National Westminster Bank, yesterday continued its recovery from bad debts and poor profitability by disclosing record after-tax profits of Dollars 69.8m (Pounds 46.5m), against Dollars 35.6m, for the second quarter. The bank's first-half earnings, which will contribute to National Westminster's interim profits to be announced in two weeks time, rose to Dollars 130.5m (Dollars 65.8m). Mr John Tugwell, chairman and chief executive, said the strengthening of the core business would continue, but in the longer term it had to raise revenues and it was investing in non-interest earnings streams to achieve this. The bank's provision to loan losses fell to Dollars 24m (Dollars 30.5m) in the second quarter. The allowance in the balance sheet for loan losses at June 30 was Dollars 544.5m, or 3.85 per cent of total loans against Dollars 657.5m or 4.63 per cent the previous year. However, the charge-offs for loans in the second quarter tripled to Dollars 91.6m (Dollars 31.3m), which the bank said related to losses on several large problem credits for which provisions had previously been established. Equity capital at June 30 stood at Dollars 1.98bn (Dollars 1.76bn), and the tier 1 ratio of core capital to risk-weighted assets strengthened to 8.13 per cent (6.65 per cent).</p>

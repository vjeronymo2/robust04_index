			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / Arts: The Merry Wives of Windsor FALSTAFF was hauled back on stage at the behest of Queen Elizabeth I, probably in 1597, to feature in The Merry Wives of Windsor, the worst sequel Shakespeare wrote. The play is supposed to have been written in two weeks, the temporal equivalent of half a Messiah, one Barchester Chronicle or any Barbara Cartland novel. Merry Wives makes poor comedy; but as a spectacle - as this production at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre proves - it can entertain well enough: a good stab at a bad play. Two problems in the play persist on stage. The first is the fat and the fatuity of Falstaff. He still has a kind of forward-waisted charm, a libido which outstrips capacity, and a wit which occasionally turns on itself: 'I have a great alacrity in sinking'. But Falstaff in Windsor lacks the edge and viciousness of Falstaff in Cheapside, never here the degraded genius who puts sensuality in the service of intellect. Falstaff, as William Hazlitt knew, became the butt rather than the originator of jokes. The second problem is the lack of scope written into this good-humoured petit bourgeois piece of suburbia. If Othello was the great Pillow Case, then Merry Wives looks like the great Basket Case. The action is domestic, and little is in question, not even the honour of Berkshire girls Ford and Page. A good director looks elsewhere, to the mechanics of the play, acknowledging the elements of knockabout farce. In 1985, Bill Alexander kicked the action into the 1950s, and gave the play a nostalgic prop or two. Here, the energies of David Thacker's production have gone into the outrageous design and costumes (William Dudley). The set is an origamist's delight of twisted paper-look stairways and cut-out balustrades, erected with Pisan inclination. The Elizabethan costumes, bold but washed-out colours, people the set with visual vulgarity. The action suffers from inexplicable pauses (Mistress Quickly crosses the entire stage just to pat Falstaff's page on the head) and journeys to the outermost parts of the set. But the acting, along with Guy Woolfenden's sweet incidental music, keeps the play afloat. Benjamin Whitrow as the fat - metabolically challenged - knight manages to negotiate the passages where Falstaff uncharacteristically has to listen to others; Whitrow conveys character in hearing, and that bespeaks high technical skill. Ron Cook's stock Frenchman, Dr Caius steals the show; he minces and drawls with panache, and one expects him to transform into Inspector Clouseau at any minute. John Nettles acts a dependable bucolic Master Page, attached to his 12-bore. It is a shame he is not in the culling vein when he finds the fat man with antlers under the oak in Windsor forest. He could have saved Shakespeare - and his nine operatic rewriters, including Salieri, Balfe, Verdi and Vaughan Williams after him - some degree of embarrassment. Master Ford, the jealous husband is rightly overplayed by Anton Lesser, who finds a psychotic rage in the character. This is the comic version of Leontes from The Winter's Tale, and the proper balance to Falstaff. Around him, Gemma Jones and Cheryl Campbell as the Mistresses Page and Ford make the most of the schoolgirl humour grafted on to their womanly appeal. Falstaff even gives Mistress Ford the ubiquitous 'toe-job', a topical reminder that the action is, after all, in Windsor, even if all Windsor wives these days are not exactly merrye. Royal Shakespeare Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, (0789) 295623. In repertory until 26 January 1993</p>

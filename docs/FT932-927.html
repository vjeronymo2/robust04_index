			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: US widens wheat trade attack THE US Agriculture Department has succumbed to pressure from Capitol Hill and farm lobbyists to direct some of its export subsidies for wheat into Mexico, where Canadian wheat has made large inroads into the market. An offer to Mexico for 1,400 tonnes of subsidised US wheat was included in an announcement of a 32m tonne multi-country package of subsidised offers for the 1983-84 marketing year. In the past, the US has used export subsidies almost exclusively to challenge the European Community. The National Association of Wheat Growers praised the Clinton Administration for combating 'blatantly unfair trading practices', which are alleged to include Canada's subsidised rail rates and prices subsidised by the Canadian Wheat Board.</p>

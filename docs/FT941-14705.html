			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / Observer: The Rovelli revels Even in today's Italy, where recession and corruption scandals have caused many family fortunes to shrink, some have managed to survive. The Rovelli clan is one such. Nino Rovelli, it may be recalled, was the aggressive tycoon whose petrochemicals empire collapsed in 1979. But this week his five direct heirs have received a handsome cheque for L678bn. The cheque represents the final settlement of a 15-year legal battle involving 12 separate hearings waged by the Rovellis against financial institutions. They were accused of failing to take proper account of the Rovellis' petrochemicals flagship, Sir, when some L4,000bn of debt was called in. The battle with IMI, the treasury-controlled financial services group now about to be privatised, was particularly bitter. Just before Nino Rovelli died two years ago he was reportedly willing to settle for L250bn; IMI then thought it might get better terms. The settlement now agreed is the largest ever such pay-out - even more so once a L330bn tax deduction is added on. IMI has long set aside covering funds; nevertheless, the Rovelli cheque looks pretty large beside the L2,200bn shortly to be raised from offering 30 per cent of its stock. The cheque goes to Rovelli's widow, Primarosa, and their four children. Now based in Switzerland, the family has yet to say how it will spend the lucre.</p>

			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Xerox to move out of financial services XEROX, the US document pro- cessing group, yesterday announced plans to shed its remaining insurance and financial services businesses to concentrate on core operations. The businesses to be discarded include Furman Selz, the New York brokerage house; Crum and Forster, the property-casualty operation; and Xerox Life, a life insurance and annuity business. Xerox said it would take an after-tax charge of Dollars 778m (Pounds 511m) in the fourth quarter as a result of the move. This figure includes a net Dollars 288m to strengthen reserves at Crum and Forster, plus Dollars 470m for a partial writedown of goodwill attaching to the financial services and insurance businesses. To help maintain its own financial position, Xerox added that its board was considering the issue of up to Dollars 500m of new equity during the first half of 1993. Mr Paul Allaire, chairman, said: 'It is imperative that Xerox continue to maintain its strong balance sheet, to make sure our document processing business has the financial resources to meet its growth objectives and to facilitate an orderly disentanglement from our insurance and financial services businesses.' Xerox's troublesome foray into the financial services sector is reckoned to have cost about Dollars 3bn. It has already pulled out of third-party financing and, on the insurance side, has withdrawn from standard personal property and casualty business. In the first nine months of 1992, Xerox made after-tax profits of Dollars 28m from financial services, compared with Dollars 374m from document processing.</p>

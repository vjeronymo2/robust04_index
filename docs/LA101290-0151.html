			<p><P> October 12, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TRESTLE'S LEGACY HAUNTS A FATHER  </P> <P> The northbound passenger train came almost silently onto the wood-and-steel  bridge, its fierce breath blowing Henry Ruley aside like an afterthought as it  whooshed by at 90 m.p.h.  </P> <P> There was no telltale clackety-clack of the rails announcing its approach. Just  that shuddering rush of turbulent wind that brushed him aside and then abruptly  pulled him toward the speeding train's wake. And the whistle that finally blew  when the train was upon him.  </P> <P> For three days now, at precisely the same moment, the 70-year-old Washington  man has come to this spot on the legendary railroad bridge just south of San  Clemente, known simply as the Trestle.  </P> <P> He's there to meet the northbound Amtrak train that passes through San Onofre  State Park each day at 12:50 p.m., passing within a few yards of one of the  most popular beaches for Orange County surfers.  </P> <P> Ruley wants to see the behemoth that killed his son, feel the fury of its  passing. And he wants to stop other youths from being run over on the trestle  that has become a shortcut for hundreds of board-laden surfers heading toward  the sandy beach below.  </P> <P> On Oct. 4, 22-year-old Adam James Ruley was struck by the train as he and two  friends crossed the venerable span while taking a shortcut from adjacent  Trestles Beach.  </P> <P> While his friends walked directly on the tracks, the north San Diego County  grocery clerk carried his bicycle along a protected catwalk on the opposite  side of a steel-girder wall that runs a third of the way along the  250-foot-long bridge, his father said.  </P> <P> But as he came around the wall at the end of the catwalk, he was suddenly met  by the train he never saw as it swept by. It hooked Ruley's bike, breaking his  neck as it dragged him for more than 40 yards along the tracks. He died at the  scene.  </P> <P> Two days later, Ruley's parents arrived from the Seattle area to lay their son  to rest in a private ceremony in which his cremated remains were spread across  San Diego Bay. But Henry Ruley says he doesn't want the issue of what he calls  a dangerous train crossing to die along with Adam.  </P> <P> "My son has died a terrible death here," Ruley said Wednesday afternoon as he  stood at the exact spot where his son was struck. "I grieve for my son terribly  but I can't do anything for him now. But I can do something for the living."  </P> <P> Moments after the northbound train passed, Ruley walked along the bridge to a  dark spot near the tracks, holding onto the wooden rail to steady himself.  "See, this is where my boy finally lay," he concluded softly.  </P> <P> It was the boy Ruley had introduced to surfing lessons at age 12, who grew up  loving the sport and the clean, crisp atmosphere of the Southern California  beaches.  </P> <P> It was the boy who called his father long-distance from his home in Vista only  a few days before just to say he loved him. And to tell him of a job interview  that was to take place the afternoon he died.  </P> <P> But those are just memories now for Henry Ruley.  </P> <P> "God, Adam," he said, standing on the bridge. "I'm not going to let you die in  vain."  </P> <P> On Tuesday, Ruley had already begun to make good on his promise. He called the  office of San Diego County Supervisor John McDonald to investigate which state  agency would be responsible for making changes at the trestle.  </P> <P> Ruley, a retired structural engineer who worked for Orange County and the state  of California, believes that, at the very least, a trip switch should be  installed to alert people walking along the bridge, which is posted by two "No  Trespassing" signs.  </P> <P> Better yet, he says, the bridge should be permanently fenced off. Also, an  adjacent walkway should be built for the surfers -- many of whom prefer to run  the bridge's 250-yard gauntlet across the mouth of a marshy estuary rather than  trudge in the nearby sand with their bulky surfboards.  </P> <P> Ruley, who moved to the Seattle area from Carlsbad four months ago, is  disappointed not to have heard from either Amtrak or the Santa Fe railroad --  which operates the tracks -- since the accident.  </P> <P> "It would have been a nice gesture," he said. "I guess to them, my son is just  another statistic. But not to me."  </P> <P> Mike Martin, a spokesman for the Santa Fe, said that at least two or three  pedestrians die each year from being struck on the tracks between San Diego and  San Clemente. But the trestle at San Onofre State Beach has not been cited as a  particular problem.  </P> <P> "Sure, those tracks are a dangerous place," Martin said. "Sixteen Amtrak trains  pass over them each day -- eight in each direction. They're going at 90 miles  an hour, 135 feet per second.  </P> <P> "And with the quarter-mile strips of continuously welded rail we've installed  this year, they run pretty silent. You don't hear the clackety-clack anymore.  But still, you've got people sleeping on the tracks or jogging on them while  wearing a Walkman.  </P> <P> "We just can't keep people off the tracks. And a fence isn't practical because  we haven't got the manpower to patrol it. They'd tear it down as soon as we put  it up."  </P> <P> Martin said he was open to suggestions on how to close the trestle to  pedestrian traffic. "I don't know if we would consider putting warning lights  or sirens in there, but we would like to see the county or the state build a  pedestrian bridge."  </P> <P> Greg Booth would like that idea just fine. The lifeguard at San Onofre State  Beach says he long ago stopped scolding the 300 to 400 surfers he sees on the  trestle during weekend patrols. "They don't do it on a dare -- they just want  to use the bridge as a 10-minute shortcut," he said.  </P> <P> The surfers use the span to cross the marshy estuary to Lower Trestles Beach,  just to the south, as well as a vantage point to scope out the surf, he said.  </P> <P> Many of the surfers aren't aware of the train schedules and walk precariously  along the tracks, waiting to duck down onto a lower culvert that runs along the  tracks, grab onto the rail and hang on for dear life -- if they see a train  approach, Booth said.  </P> <P> "Most of these kids aren't afraid of anything," he said. "I've seen some run  along the tracks right in front of the train. When it catches up with them,  they finally leap down to cling onto the wooden rail. Or they make the 25-foot  jump off the side of the bridge.  </P> <P> "Some might break a leg or an arm. But their attitude is 'Hey, at least I  didn't damage my board.' Most wouldn't think of saving themselves first."  </P> <P> Booth said he was first at the scene when Ruley was killed.  </P> <P> "That kid had everything going against him," he said. "The wind was blowing  hard, so he probably didn't hear the train whistle. After he died, all his  friends could keep saying to themselves at the scene was, 'Why do we do this?  Why?' "  </P> <P> The bridge, Booth said, is the last obstacle of a long trek surfers face to  reach picturesque Trestles Beach.  </P> <P> For years, the beach was closed to surfers. Now, hundreds of youths park their  cars east of Interstate 5 and make their way along the 1 1/2-mile walkway that  was opened in 1972 when former First Lady Pat Nixon developed a fondness for  the sweeping stretches of beach within view of her San Clemente home.  </P> <P> Though it saves them time, some surfers say they still avoid the dangerous  trestle. "It's just a foolish thing to do," said Jesse Henry, 19, of Huntington  Beach.  </P> <P> One day four years ago, Henry recalled, he was the last of five surfers to  reach the safety of the catwalk area where Ruley met his death -- a  split-second before the train rushed past them.  </P> <P> "Those trains are just a lot faster and quieter now," he said. "They stalk you  on that bridge if you're not careful. So I just stay away from there."  </P> <P> Henry was just one of the surfers who offered their condolences to Henry Ruley  as he walked along the path to the beach.  </P> <P> Along the walkway, other surfers had written graffiti messages to the young  surfer known to his friends as "Kirby" because he used to hit the curb so often  while learning to drive a car.  </P> <P> "Thanks Adam," one message said. Another: "Remember Kirby."  </P> <P> At the base of the bridge, just beneath the spot where Adam Ruley died, friends  have posted a bronze memorial plaque. His mother and father -- who have three  older children -- have brought flowers to the site, tenderly setting them on  the arched wooden support beams.  </P> <P> "This is a frightening place," Ruley said of the bridge as he lay more flowers  at the memorial. "I cringe at the thought of that train and I don't even like  to get close to it. But I have this anger.  </P> <P> "As an engineer, we called places like these an attractive nuisance because  they attracted people to danger. Well, this is an attractive deathtrap. It's a  hazard that's been neglected by Amtrak and the railroad.  </P> <P> "And it's obvious more kids will lose out while playing out their odds on this  bridge."  </P></p>

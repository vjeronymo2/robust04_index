			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Jan Gunnar Furuly: "Losses Small From </F> Antiwhaling Actions"]    [Text] Only 14 Norwegian exporting firms lost between 6.1  and 9.8 million [Norwegian] kroner [NKr] because of Norwegian  minke whale harvesting.    "I would characterize the losses as insignificant,"  Professor  Trond Bjorndal of the School of Advanced Economic Studies in  Bergen said. Bjorndal was presenting a brand-new study  commissioned by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.    Some parts of the industrial and commercial sector in Norway  feared the worst when Norway decided to resume commercial minke  whaling last year. The report concludes, however, that only  ripple effects have been registered from the boycott actions in  Great Britain, Germany, and the United States. The report  researchers were not able to measure any losses for Norwegian  businesses in other markets.  <H5>  Worst in Germany </H5>   The figures of lost sales presented yesterday in Oslo are in  stark contrast to the claims of the environmental organization  Greenpeace that said that Norwegian business last year lost  NKr450 million in canceled contracts because of whaling.    The environmental activists were the most successful in  harming Norwegian exporters in Germany. Presumed losses have  been registered by seven Norwegian exporting companies, two of  which were fish exporters. A number of other businesses reported  canceled contracts, but according to Bjorndal this was  compensated for by the businesses finding other buyers for their  products.    All in all Norwegian businesses had a sales loss of NKr10.7  million on the German market. With an adjustment for  nonincurred production expenses the businesses wound up with a  reduced profit of between NKr2.7 and NKr4.4 million.    "We think this is the correct way to gauge the losses to  Norwegian industry. It is pointless to attach numbers to  canceled contracts," Prof. Bjorndal stressed.  <H5>  Increased Export </H5>   In Great Britain the losses to Norwegian firms are estimated  at between 2.7 and NKr4.4 million. In the United States there  do not appear to have been any losses as a result of antiwhaling  actions, but three firms did have extra expenses for  warehousing, legal aid, and information campaigns to the tune of  NKr700,000.    Bjorndal pointed out that during the same period Norwegian  business and industry generally made much progress in the very  markets where Greenpeace and other environmental groups had  urged a boycott of Norway.    Fish exports to Great Britain and Germany increased by 11  and  4.6 percent respectively, compared with the preceding year. At  the same time there was a strong increase in German tourist  traffic in Norway, while British tourism in Norway stagnated.  But the reduced size of British tourist traffic to Norway in  1993 was much lower than the overall reduction in British travel  abroad. While the number of British guest days in Norway  declined by 3.9 percent, the overall reduction in British travel  abroad was about 12 percent.    "The preliminary figures for influx of tourists last year  show that the strong skepticism voiced by the exporting sector  regarding Norwegian whaling were not well founded in reality,"  Prof. Bjorndal said.  <H5>  [Box, p 4] </H5> <H5>  Whaling 1993 </H5>    -  Norwegian whalers shot 226 whales last year for an initial  value of NKr13.2 million.    -  Twenty-eight vessels participated in  the traditional whaling; four vessels did research whaling.    -  The  Ministry of Foreign Affairs spent NKr11.5 million on special  information campaigns abroad.    -  Training of inspectors for the  whaling vessels cost NKr2.5 million.    -  If the harvest of minke  whales increases to 1,700-1,800 animals, the activity will have  a market potential of NKr250 million.</p>

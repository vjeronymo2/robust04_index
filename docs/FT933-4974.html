			<p>930906 FT  06 SEP 93 / International Company News: French retailer trebles profit CASINO, one of France's largest food retailing groups, achieved a three-fold increase in pre-tax profits to FFr60.1m (Dollars 10.32m) in the first half of the year, writes John Ridding in Paris. The rise from FFr18m in the first six months of 1992 reflected its merger with Rallye, the supermarket group, at the end of last year. Net attributable profits rose much more slowly, increasing by 2.5 per cent to FFr17.6m. Sales rose slightly from FFr33.25bn to FFr33.75bn. But the group said that the increase was impressive against the background of falling consumer demand and supermarket price wars arising from the recession in France. In a statement to shareholders, Casino expressed optimism about the remainder of the year. It said that cost cutting measures introduced over the past two years were beginning to bear fruit and that the merger with Rallye was progressing smoothly.</p>

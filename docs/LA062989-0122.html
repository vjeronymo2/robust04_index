			<p><P> June 29, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Testimony in the case of a Cuban military hero who confessed to smuggling  drugs, ivory and diamonds hinted at involvement by Havana in a secret operation  in Venezuela. Several witnesses told a military tribunal in Havana that Maj.  Gen. Arnaldo Ochoa Sanchez had been an "internacionalista" in Venezuela.  "Internacionalista" is a term Cubans use to describe someone willing to fight  anywhere in the world for the ideals of Cuba's Communist revolution. This was  the first mention of Ochoa's name in connection with Venezuela. Witnesses at  the tribunal gave no details of the operation.  </P></p>

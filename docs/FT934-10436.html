			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / Management: Uphill struggle to become 'horizontal' IT IS easier to be converted to a radical new religion than to practise it. Even in fashion-mad America, where the religion of business process re-engineering has spread like wildfire over the past 12 months and about 50 per cent of large companies claim to be practising it, only 5 or 10 per cent are doing so properly, according to one of its high priests, James Champy. Most are finding it more daunting than expected. So a sizeable dose of scepticism is appropriate about a related but even more revolutionary movement which is threatening to burst forth - that of the 'horizontal organisation'. For anyone who has somehow missed all the hype surrounding business process re-engineering over the past year, it should be explained that it is an ungainly term coined by Champy and a fellow consultant, Michael Hammer to describe the complete redesign of the main operational processes of a company: order generation and fulfilment, logistics, product development and so on. Re-engineering promises remarkable improvements in cost, quality, speed and productivity - sometimes more than tenfold. But it is hard to practise properly, since it entails vast political and human upheaval, including for people who keep their jobs. In all but the smallest organisation, operational processes have always been carried out laboriously (in every sense) across a series of fragmented 'functions' or specialist departments. These include product or service design, engineering, production, marketing, service and accounting. Each has its own hierarchy, down and up which communication has to pass before it is transferred to the next department. Most western organisations have been only partly successful in bridging such vertical structures either with permanent 'matrices' or temporary project teams, task forces and other 'overlays', as consultants insist on calling them. Re-engineering - or 'core process redesign' as some of Hammer and Champy's rivals more accurately call it - goes a big step further. It transforms such processes into ones which flow permanently across the relevant departments at the appropriate level, usually pretty low. This involves not only 'delayering' those departments, and removing front-line staff from them, but sometimes breaking them up. Champy's 5-to-10 per cent of US companies and a smaller proportion of European ones, have reached various stages down this track. Treading warily in view of the wrenching changes involved, most have re-engineered just one of their key processes and others only a couple. Even at some of the fastest movers, such as Texas Instruments, the revolution has been confined so far to one, or just a few, of their business divisions. Only a handful, such as Taco-Bell and the Astra-Merck pharmaceuticals alliance in the US, and National and Provincial building society in Britain, have yet found religion to the extent of revolutionising structures at the top, as well as lower down and giving process responsibilities not just to junior and middle managers, but also to senior executives. To distinguish this from 'mere' re-engineering, Hammer calls it 'the process-managed organisation'. Two years ago the maverick N&amp;P actually started its transformation at the top, before introducing it lower down. Assuming that the N&amp;P's messianic chief executive survives last week's breakdown of his proposed merger with a more staid rival, Leeds Permanent (see right), N&amp;P will soon become one of the few sizeable enterprises in Europe to warrant the 'horizontal' label. The idea of horizontal, team-based large organisations, with almost no hierarchy, has been extolled in academic textbooks for years. But is it realistic? Like pavement prophets with their sandwich-boards, hyperbole-prone American professors and consultants have claimed repeatedly that its coming was nigh. But they have weakened their case by sticking the 'horizontal' label on companies such as EDS, the US information technology services group. Although it is certainly very project- and team-based, it is still heavily hierarchical in parts. But horizontal organisations are now at last arriving, swears Frank Ostroff, a New York-based consultant from McKinsey and Co. 'This is real,' he insists. As Ostroff defines it, a horizontal organisation embraces not only 'core process redesign' and all the other elements of a re-engineered one, but plenty more besides. Most important, it provides the overall structure, reward systems and multi-purpose skill-training needed to link all its teams together so that they perform miracles for the customer without creating process barriers which are just as harmful as the old departmental ones. Ostroff's prescription shares several aspects of the concept of 'organisational architecture' popularised in the US by a rival consultant, David Nadler and practised by Xerox. In propounding his case, Ostroff suffers from the handicap of client confidentiality; some of the most striking cases of 'horizontalisation' are still under wraps, he says. He also qualifies his own claims for horizontalism by saying that, even a decade from now, only perhaps 10 per cent of companies will be fully horizontal, and that most will be 'hybrids', retaining a degree of verticality. That is only realistic, given the impracticality of running almost any big company entirely without hierarchy. But it also shows up the term 'horizontal' for what it will remain for most organisations: optimistic or misleading. In the interests of clarity it should be replaced. Given the awfulness and ambiguity of well-trodden academic adjectives such as 'differentiated', 'hybrid' and 'mixed', Hammer's awkward 'process-managed' comes closest to the mark. Can anyone suggest a more stylish improvement?</p>

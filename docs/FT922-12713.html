			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / World Trade News: Washington stands firm on anti-trust decision A US Justice Department official said yesterday there was 'no likelihood' his department would reconsider its April 3 decision to enforce US anti-trust laws against foreign companies on the basis of harm to US exports, AP-DJ reports from Tokyo. But Mr James Rill, assistant attorney-general, dismissed concerns that the change would be used as a trade policy weapon, noting rather that it was 'a strong way of avoiding a trade war'. Mr Rill was speaking after attending a bilateral conference in Tokyo this week on US and Japanese anti-monopoly laws. During the conference, Japanese officials repeatedly expressed their opposition to the change in US policy. Mr Setsuo Umezawa, head of the Japan Fair Trade Commission, said enforcement of the policy could violate principles of international jurisdiction, and expressed fears it would be abused as a trade policy tool. Mr Umezawa and other Japanese officials indicated that implementing the policy could fuel friction in US-Japan relations. They wanted to work on convergence of anti-trust procedures multilaterally through the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.</p>

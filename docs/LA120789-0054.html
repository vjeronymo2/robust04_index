			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SERIES CARRIED 'INACCURATE' TITLE  </P> <P> I have read several of the "End of Nature" series by Bill McKibben (Nov. 23-26)  and agree that it says valuable things and says them well.  </P> <P> However, I have to deplore McKibben's decision to saddle it with that alarmist  and inaccurate title. The meaning of McKibben's analysis is not that nature is  ending, but that nature is taking its natural course and correcting in its  ponderous and amoral way the temporary imbalances brought about by man's  irreverent and heedless misuse of the planet during the last few centuries.  </P> <P> Nature, I assure you, will not come out second best in a head-to-head showdown  between nature and mankind. A few dozen (or hundred) species may become extinct  somewhat sooner than the natural order would dictate; Homo sapiens may well be  among them.  </P> <P> Natural processes will eliminate (or minimize) the human irritant and the Earth  will set about to compensate for man's meddling. McKibben's series might better  be titled "The End of Civilization."  </P> <P> ANDREW A. WATSON  </P> <P> Bakersfield  </P></p>

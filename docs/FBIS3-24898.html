Introducing the NP's manifesto at its federal congress  on Thursday [3 February], he said only the NP possessed the  experience, resources and expertise to meet the challenges ahead.    The ANC [African National Congress] had no experience of  government, was toying with discredited policies which had  brought disaster wherever they had been tried and its leadership  included many SA Communist Party members with their own hidden  agendas.    "I promised to lead the way to a new South Africa in which  all would enjoy greater freedom. The transitional constitution,  which has been negotiated by the NP, goes a long way toward  fulfilling this promise.    "It extends full political and civil rights to those who  previously did not have them and greatly strengthens the rights  of those who did.    "I am calling on you to help the NP to defend, consolidate  and build on the progress we have made."    He says historic challenges will face the country after the  election including those of stimulating rapid economic growth,  providing decent facilities for millions of South Africans and  that of national reconciliation. Mr de Klerk says the NP is open  to all who support the common vision of peace and security based  on the rule of law, a non-racial democracy which will promote  the dignity and full development of all, freedom of religion,  sound economic policies which include a fair tax system,  protection of minority rights and decent, affordable and  efficient education, health care and social services.    "If you share this vision, then join me by voting for the  NP.  Work with us and support our vision for the future."</p>

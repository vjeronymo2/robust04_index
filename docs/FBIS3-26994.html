The call came from the pro-China Democratic Alliance for the  Betterment of Hong Kong (DAB).    September's election looks set to be a litmus test of  democracy in Hong Kong, with a close contest between the liberal  and pro-China factions. The United Democrats, Meeting Point and  the Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood have  already struck an unprecedented electoral deal to avoid putting  up competing candidates. Now, pro-China factions are looking at  similar measures.    The DAB's vice-chairman, legislator Tam Yiu-chung, said  yesterday he would welcome the co-operation of other pro-China  candidates or parties intending to contest the election. He  added that his party had not yet canvassed support for the idea.  "This is not just to counter the liberal forces, but to avoid  clashes within the pro-China camp," he said. Despite successes  in the previous election, the liberals might have difficulty  coordinating a pact to maximise their vote, Mr Tam predicted.  "It's not easy to compromise since there are so many liberal  factions competing." He revealed that the DAB itself was facing  some internal friction over candidates.    Meeting Point legislator Zachary Wong predicted a bitter  battle in each constituency between liberal and pro-China  candidates. "I believe most of the constituencies will be a  one-to-one battlefield with a pro-China and a liberal candidate  fighting each other," he said.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Dalya Shehori: "I Like Being Director General; </F> I Want To Serve Rabin"]    [Text] As far as Shim'on Sheves is concerned, he is  realizing the dreams and plans he brought to the prime  minister's bureau when he became its director general, and he is  pleased with a job well done. Others -- ministers and public  figures who maintain close ties with the prime minister's bureau  -- paint a different picture. Sheves established a team to  monitor the implementation of the prime minister's and  government's decisions, including the way budgets are used by  the various ministries. According to him, the team has been  operating, coordinating, and discharging its duties. Others say  the follow-up team collapsed several months after its  establishment. There is a considerable disparity between the  versions.    While media descriptions have portrayed Sheves as a very  strong man, whose proximity to Yitzhaq Rabin has put him in  control of extensive information and of the fate of ministers  and officials, it now transpires that ministers who had a  falling-out with Sheves lost nothing of the access to or good  ties with Rabin. Agriculture Minister Ya'aqov Tzur,  Construction and Housing Minister Binyamin Ben-Eli'ezer, and  Finance Minister Avraham Shohat enter the prime minister's  bureau daily and meet with him whenever necessary. When Shohat  presented the cabinet the Finance Ministry's plan dealing with  unemployment, while an alternative plan drafted by strategic  adviser Hayim Asa -- who has meanwhile been fired -- was  submitted on behalf of Sheves, the cabinet endorsed Shohat's  plan.    A cabinet minister said off the record: "I do not think he  is powerful. He did not manage to really harm Beiga [Avraham]  Shohat, perhaps just to smear him, and even that is too strong  an expression. The bottom line is that Beiga sees Rabin and  talks to him, while Sheves has been forced to withdraw his  ideas. It was very obvious at a housing discussion (where  Sheves proposed reverting to public construction and greater  government involvement -- DS)."    Officials close to Shohat say the finance minister sees his  conflict with Sheves and Sheves' ability to harm him as some  force majeure with which he has to live. Shohat finds solace in  the fact that Rabin never comes out against him and in the prime  minister's loyalty to him.    A man conversant with affairs at Rabin's bureau says that  when Sheves arrived there, he had many grand schemes to  establish a structure similar to that of the White House team,  with himself at the top. "All doors leading to the bureau were  repainted, many new signs were put up, a project follow-up team  was set up, as were other bodies. But Sheves, a pugnacious man  who suited Rabin's needs in the primaries and the election  campaign, was unable to take charge of such a complex system.  Every system he established collapsed, and decent members of  the bureau staff admitted there was nothing for them to do  there. What remains today is Rabin's skeleton headquarters:  Military Secretary Dani Yatom, who liaises with the Mosad and  the Shin Bet and arranges the prime minister's flights and  receipt of cables; bureau chief Eytan Haber, who writes the  prime minister's speeches and is on intimate terms with Rabin.  Sheves is nonexistent. He still plays a political role, and as  a man with street savvy, he understands the trends in the  street, but he does not participate in security and political  consultations."    Time has proven that 42-year-old Sheves often engages in  power contests, in which he is defeated. In the words of one of  the ministers: "He draws all his strength from Rabin. If he is  separated from him, he will not be able to survive." When  Sheves put his strength to a test by promoting Yuval Frenkel's  candidacy for Labor party secretary general, the job was won by  Nisim Zvili. Ya'aqov Tzur refused to accept Sheves' dictums  regarding appointments, but this never hurt his standing.  Binyamin Ben-Eli'ezer did tell the government that the  Construction Ministry's housing plan is coordinated with the  prime minister's bureau, but for Ben-Eli'ezer this was  apparently a one-time concession. Shohat has not deviated from  his economic doctrine, and he continues to back Treasury  officials.    It seems that Sheves' tests of power ultimately tarnished  his image. He once said in a press interview that he must be  believed when he says that he does not appoint people, but only  recommends appointments to the prime minister occasionally.  Then we thought he was acting humble, but today we can believe  him.    The revolution Sheves brought about in the Prime Minister's  Office and bureau -- cutting down the number of advisers to the  prime minister; making all other advisers administratively  subordinate to the director general; creating new departments  and liaison mechanisms between government ministers; improving  services to the citizen -- may have been ahead of its time. It  would have been more suitable for a time when the prime minister  is chosen in direct elections and his powers resemble those of  the U.S. President. At the moment, the system does not work  well, and only a handful of ministers come to the bureau to  coordinate issues with Sheves. For his part, he concentrates  his efforts on socioeconomic issues, including the  reclassification of development areas and localized treatment of  backward or problematic areas (including in the Arab sector),  and gets praised for it.    Rabin did not interfere with the innovations Sheves made in  the Prime Minister's Office. He does not need advisers any way,  and except for substantive issues, what happens in the bureau  does not interest him. Gradually the bureau began emptying of  people and goals. Advisers and key officials, such as Cabinet  Secretary Elyaqim Rubinstein, media adviser Gad Ben-Ari, and  political adviser Jacques Neriya, quit recently. On the face of  it, each of them quit for his own reasons. But, according to  knowledgeable sources, most of these departures could have been  avoided if these officials had had better access to information.  They had no problem accessing the prime minister, but  information in various areas was blocked to them and this  hindered their work and led to compartmentalization and  frustration. Haber and Sheves are seen as the guilty party.    The prime minister's bureau is having a hard time filling  the  vacated jobs. Interviewed by Qol Yisra'el, Sheves said that  "many people would like to be cabinet secretaries and the prime  minister's spokesman." He said he was talking about dozens of  people, "all of them good," and noted that the prime minister  would soon make up his mind. However, other bureau staffers  would only say that the job of cabinet secretary became vacated  on 1 April, that Rubinstein was asked to stay on until May, and  that no replacement had been found to overlap with him.    Although the fact that the prime minister's media adviser  would be quitting had been known for a few months, Ben-Ari left  and his job has not yet been filled. One could say that the  prime minister is the best government spokesman, and that he  makes statements to the media quite often. However, the job of  spokesman includes regular contacts with journalists, and while  Israeli journalists can obtain information from other sources in  the prime minister's bureau, foreign journalists have nobody to  turn to.    People who know Sheves' working ability praise his  performance and even his tendency to iron out differences and  cut corners. "Sheves is a very good can-do man," said Justice  Minister David Liba'i, the only minister who was prepared to  speak for the record. "Myself, I have had very little contact  with him, but his attitude has always been businesslike and  matter-of-fact."    He is regarded as a sharp and intelligent man, but not as a  methodic and theoretical thinker. People note his integrity and  his disposition to speak up his mind anywhere, even to Rabin.  According to various testimonies, Sheves does not recoil from  confronting Rabin when this is necessary. A person who  witnessed such a confrontation says that Sheves insisted on his  position even when Rabin hollered at him. The same person added  that Rabin hates obsequiousness and appreciates men who stand up  for their views.    People say that with Sheves, a sensitive and direct man, you  know exactly where you stand and note that he is a good friend.  Other people, however, say that he can also be crass and rude.</p>

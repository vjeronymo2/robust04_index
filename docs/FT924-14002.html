			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / Shake-up planned for Scots councils THE GOVERNMENT spelt out options yesterday for a drastic reshaping of local government in Scotland, sweeping away the two-tier structure established in 1974 and creating between 15 and 51 new single-tier councils. The new system, which would come into effect in 1996, would entail changes to Scotland's nine regional councils, including the disappearance of Labour-dominated Strathclyde regional council, which contains nearly half Scotland's 5m people. A consultation document presenting options for the single-tier system quotes the conclusion of Touche Ross, the accountants, that provided there were no more than 43 councils the new system would lead to long-term savings of public expenditure. Initially, the savings would be exceeded by transitional expenses. Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, said the existing system, brought in by the Conservatives, was inconsistent with the present needs of local government. It had been designed at a time when the public sector was expected to lead economic development and deliver a wide range of services. People wanted to be better able to identify who was responsible. People found it hard to identify with the large regional authorities and still often thought of themselves as living in the old counties or burghs. There was also confusion for many people about which services were provided by the regional councils and which by the 53 district councils, while there was some overlap between them. Launching a consultation process, backed by an explanatory video, Mr Lang said he wanted a system that reflected local loyalties and was cost-effective and efficient. The new councils did not have to be of uniform size and he had 'an open mind' on the most appropriate structure. In England, a commission under Sir John Banham is touring the country, deciding where new authorities should be. The Welsh Office has already issued a document spelling out where single-tier authorities will be in Wales. One of the four options set out in yesterday's green paper for Scotland is for 15 single-tier authorities. That would allow eight of the regional councils to remain, absorbing the functions of the districts - Strathclyde would be split. The structure of local government in Scotland.

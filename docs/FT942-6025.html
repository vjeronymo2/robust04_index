			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / S Korea considers early OECD entry: Government advised to hasten pace of de-regulation South Korea is considering an unexpectedly early entry into the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, which yesterday urged the country to hasten deregulation to ensure continued growth. The South Korean finance ministry said the government was contemplating a December application to the OECD, which it was hoping to join in 1996. The entry will mark another important step in the country's rapid economic progress. In a survey released yesterday, the OECD gave good marks to a comprehensive package of economic deregulation and financial liberalisation measures proposed last year. But it added several caveats to its approval, particularly in the area of financial liberalisation. 'In contrast to false starts in the past, it is important that this (deregulation) programme be implemented in full, and at a pace which leaves markets in no doubt that the process is irreversible,' the report said. It said that even if the reform plan was implemented by 1997, the South Korean financial system will still have a higher degree of control than is found in most OECD countries. It suggested, for example, that controls on capital inflows should be further loosened in spite of South Korean fears that such a move could lead to inflationary pressure resulting from an increase in money supply. Other recommendations included a quickening of interest rate deregulation and allowing financial institutions more freedom to introduce new products. The South Korean government has used its tight control over the financial system to guide industrial policy, and an easing of controls will be seen as a challenge to its authority. The OECD was critical that 'some elements of the old credit allocation will remain at the end of the liberalisation period'. These include a requirement that banks extend 45 per cent of their loans to small companies to promote their growth, while restricting loans to the 30 largest conglomerates, or chaebol. The OECD suggested the government's efforts to curb the economic power of the chaebol through credit restrictions were misguided. 'An economically more efficient policy would give the chaebol complete freedom to determine their activities. This considerable power over private companies is not only at variance with the concept of a free-market economy but may also put domestic firms at a disadvantage' in competition with foreign rivals, it stated. It recommended that the government should instead focus on 'preventing actual abuse of market power' by the chaebol.</p>

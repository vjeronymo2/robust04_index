			<p>Language: <F P=105>Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed talk: "Ugly Pro-U.S., Pro-Japan Flunkyist </F> Nation-Seller"]    [Text] Puppet traitor Kim Yong-sam is a vicious pro-U.S.  flunky nation-seller who sold out the nation's vital interest  under the veil of civilian government.    The pro-U.S. flunkyist nation-selling act of the puppet  traitor was, above all, the opening of the market of rice, which  is blood and flesh of the South Korean people.    Even successive puppets did not dare to touch on this issue.  Nevertheless, the puppet traitor Kim Yong-sam carried out  behind- the-scenes negotiations with the White House over the  issue of rice market opening, using it as a useful card,  immediately after the merge of political parties. By doing this,  he was selected as a presidential candidate at last.    As was disclosed to the world, Pak Chol-on made remarks  during the presidential elections that if he were to speak out,  Kim Yong- sam would be removed from office. His remarks  referred to such maneuvers by Kim Yong-sam, and Kim Yong-sam's  imprisoning him was designed to shut his mouth.    During the so-called summit held between South Korea and the  United States on 23 November last year in the wake of the  Uruguay Round negotiation, traitor Kim Yong-sam secretly pledged  the opening of the rice markets and finally signed the  memorandum of agreement.    Because of the traitorous act of the puppet Kim Yong-sam,  agriculture in South Korea faced destiny of complete bankruptcy  and six million South Korean farmers lost means of living. Thus,  South Korea has been deprived of even the last foundation of  national economy and reduced to the U.S. rice market.    The criminal act of the puppet Kim Yong-sam as a flunkyist  nation-seller did not end at this. As has been known, Clinton's  idea for the new Pacific community is designed to hold in check  [kyonje] Japan and China with the U.S. system for colonial  domination over South Korea as the axis and to bind countries in  the Asia and Pacific region with its domination system.    Nevertheless, the puppet Kim Yong-sam, who attended the  Asian- Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Seattle last  November, stated that his new diplomacy is similar to Clinton's  idea for the new Pacific community, thus attempting to court  Clinton's favor. He then put the rope of this domination system  on South Korea.    Moreover, last April, the puppet traitor Kim Yong-sam agreed  to allow the United States to freely use port facilities in  South Korea in an emergency according to the agreement on  wartime support for the occupation forces concluded with the  United States. In May, he conceded most U.S. Air Force  facilities, which were to be turned over to South Korea, to the  U.S. Seventh Air Force so that it can use these facilities  continuously. Following this, in August, he effectuated the plan  for supplementing logistics and civilian manpower to the U.S.  Forces through the "93-Ulchi Focus-Lens" exercise. Thus, he  reduced the whole land of South Korea to a consumption object  for execution of the U.S. strategy.    With a view to keeping U.S. Forces in South Korea, the  puppet  traitor Kim Yong-sam fabricated even a nation-selling special  treaty to increase the rate of sharing expenses for maintaining  U.S. Forces in South Korea during South Korea-U.S. annual  security consultative conference and South Korea-U.S. summit.  Thus, he finally made the reduction of U.S. Forces in South  Korea withheld.    The pro-Japan flunkyist nation-selling act of puppet traitor  Kim Yong-sam far surpasses the pro-Japan flunkyist acts of Pak  Chong-hui and Kim Chong-pil. The puppet traitor Kim Yong-sam  once denounced Kim Chong-pil, who signed the South Korea-Japan  treaty, as a pro- Japan nation-seller more vicious than the five  traitors of the Ulsa Protectorate Treaty [of 1905] between Korea  and Japan. However, he invited Japanese Prime Minister Hosokawa  and reconfirmed the nation- selling agreement on basic relations  between South Korea and Japan. Moreover, he committed a  flunkyist nation-selling act by nullifying Japan's past crimes.    The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique, whose political foundation  is  weaker than any successive puppet regime, entered more deeply  into Japan's economic and military sphere in an attempt to win  its support.    The Japanese reactionaries built high barriers against South  Korean products. However, the Kim Yong-sam nation-selling clique  announced his so-called economic policy toward Japan in last  August. According to this policy, the measures on banning  imports of some Japanese commodities, which have been  implemented only for form's sake, will be completely lifted by  1997.    While advancing along the road of military collaboration  with  Japan which is emerging as a great nuclear state and great  military power, the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique let the  high-ranking officers of the Japan Self-Defense Forces  participate [chamga] in the Team Spirit joint military exercise  under the pretext of an observers team.    Because of pro-U.S. and pro-Japan flunkyist nation-selling  acts of the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique, South Korea's  subordination to the United States and Japan has been further  deepened and South Korea is falling in depth as a dual colony of  the United States and Japan.</p>

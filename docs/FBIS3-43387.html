			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Rwanda entered the great transition today,  enlarged by the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF]. [passage omitted]    [Begin Habyarimana recording] Excellencies, Ladies and  Gentlemen, my sincere thanks for responding to my invitation,  for being here. I have invited you to this morning's ceremony.  I have especially invited the relevant people. However, just  like you, I have noted that the president of the Constitutional  Court is not present. I would like to recall Article 7 of the  agreement on the various questions and final dispositions.  Article 7 says in its penultimate paragraph that the deputies  to the transitional assembly shall swear before the president of  the Republic in the presence of the president of the  Constitutional Court. As the president of the Constitutional  Court is not here, the disposition cannot be fulfilled.    I also note that no deputy of the RPF is present. Those I  asked to check on those present have told me about this, that no  deputy of the RPF is present in the hall and that no deputy of  the Social Democratic Party is present. This is in addition to  the absence of the president of the Constitutional Court.    Therefore, it is my duty to postpone the session, but I  remain ready to convene it again once the relevant people are  present, that is to say the deputies who will be sworn in, and  once the authorities mentioned in Article 7 are available to  accomplish their duties.    Therefore, I am postponing the session. I once again thank  you for being here, for troubling yourselves. I would like to  make a special call, especially to those not present, and to the  international community, especially our friends who accompanied  us to Arusha for more than one year to negotiate the peace  agreement, for each of us to make a real and obvious effort, so  that the international community can assist us. Also I hope  that Rwanda sets up the transitional institutions as planned in  the Arusha agreement, first of all the transitional national  assembly, and then the broad-based transitional government.    In addition to my thanks, I wish you a good evening. The  session has therefore been postponed for the reasons given and I  am ready to reconvene it once the difficulties that we  encountered this evening have been resolved. [end recording]</p>

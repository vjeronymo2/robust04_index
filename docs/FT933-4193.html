			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Brussels tightens Italian aid curbs THE European Commission yesterday reinforced its increasingly tough line on state aid in Italy when it attached strict conditions, applicable to all Italian state holdings, to its authorisation of payments to creditors of Efim, the liquidated state industrial holding. Yesterday's decision follows a preliminary deal reached in July between Mr Karel Van Miert, EC commissioner for competition, and Mr Beniamino Andreatta, Italian foreign minister, which allowed for repayment of half the bank loans. Efim was put into liquidation in July 1992 with total debts of nearly L18,000bn (Pounds 7.49bn). Financial institutions were owed L9.3bn of this, including more than L3,500bn to foreign banks. The loans were guaranteed by the state under Italian law, and Rome argued it was obliged to honour what amounted to sovereign debt. The Commission accepted this argument, but in effect held up the deal as part of a wider effort to bring Italian state aid under control. At the time of the July understanding between Brussels and Rome, the Italian government withdrew its plan to write off debts worth Ecu4bn (Pounds 3.08bn) run up by Ilva, the steel group. The two sides are still negotiating the size of the write-off against Commission demands for a sharp reduction in steel capacity, due to be discussed at a special Council of Ministers meeting in two weeks' time. Now, as part of the definitive agreement on Efim, the Italian government will have to: Impose a freeze on debt at state-owned companies by the end of 1993; Reduce this debt to levels in equivalent companies in the private sector by the end of 1996; Revoke the government's loan guarantee arrangements to state-owned companies immediately afterwards; Agree to the Commission's joint monitoring of the whole process. 'We have to ensure that in a few years' time the (Italian) state won't come back to us with the same arguments,' a spokesman for Mr Van Miert said. The remainder of Efim's debts, largely to suppliers, will be dealt with under normal state aids procedures, the Commission stated. Italy's labour minister yesterday played down the risk that job riots could spread following violent protests over the threatened closure of a chemical plant in the southern port of Crotone, Reuter reports from Rome. 'There is an emergency, but there will not be 10, 100 or even 1,000 other cases like Crotone,' the Labour minister, Mr Gino Giugni, told the daily la Repubblica newspaper after workers reacted to lay-off notices by destroying part of their condemned factory. In Crotone itself, riot police continued to surround the factory which hundreds of workers were occupying. On Monday night, protesters sacked the plant's offices and set fire to a main road by pouring highly toxic phosphorus on it after ENI, the state energy group, said it would lay off 80 per cent of the workforce at its Enichem plant in Crotone. Unions have accused ENI of acting irresponsibly over the Crotone lay-offs and warned that violence could break out in other high unemployment areas. Union leaders said that decisions like ENI's in Crotone, or the sacking of 2,000 municipal workers in Naples, were either sheer stupidity or a deliberate ploy to make the south explode.</p>

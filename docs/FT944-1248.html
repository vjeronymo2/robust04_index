			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / Regulator's hint led to Trafalgar Pounds 20 rebate offer Trafalgar House, the conglom-erate mounting a hostile bid for Northern Electric, decided to offer a Pounds 20 rebate to each of its 1.3m customers at the prompting of Prof Stephen Littlechild, electricity industry regulator. Mr Brian Keelan, of Swiss Bank Corporation, advising Trafalgar, disclosed yesterday that the rebate concept arose from a meeting about a month ago at the regulator's office. Mr Keelan said: 'Prof Littlechild made it clear it would be easier for him to consider a bid for a regional electricity company that contained in its terms a tangible benefit for the consumer, over and above the tariff reduction that was published in August. He added: 'Prof Littlechild decided he was Robin Hood. To walk us through Sherwood Forest, the consumer would have to have something tangible, not a statement of intentions or a warm and fuzzy feeling.' Describing this as a 'hint', Mr Keelan said: 'We would probably have done something like that anyway, but it's helpful to be guided by the regulator.' Mr Keelan's comments, made at a press conference in Newcastle upon Tyne, where Northern is based, will strengthen claims by Prof Littlechild's critics that the regulatory regime, to take effect from April, is too lax. 'If Prof Littlechild believes Northern can afford to hand over Pounds 26m to customers under a new management, why did he not ask the existing regime to do it in August?' one analyst asked. Shares in Northern and most other regional electricity companies fell yesterday after Prof Littlechild published a consultation paper on Trafalgar's bid. Although he reaches no firm conclusions in the paper, he discusses the possibility of a referral of the bid to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. If Trafalgar were to take over Northern, he says, it would be the first time a public electricity supply licence would be held by a subsidiary company rather than its parent. Prof Littlechild's initial view is that this is insufficient reason to bar a takeover but he wants to consider licence changes in the event of takeovers. He points to concerns about the resources a parent may provide to its electricity subsidiary 'to enable it to undertake its functions' and says he will be considering licence changes to take these into account.</p>

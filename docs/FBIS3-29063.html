President Kim's reform has no clear-cut principles and  targets, said Rep. Kim Pyong-o, chairman of the party's Policy  Committee, in the DP's evaluation called "the limitations of the  Kim Yong-sam Administration's reform and 10 acts of misrule."    The party listed the following 10 [number as received] types  of misrule by Kim in the first year of his presidency:    Rising consumer prices, failure in the Uruguay Round of  trade  negotiations and forced opening of the rice market, negligence  on the North Korean nuclear issue and a setback in inter-Korean  dialogue, railroading of bills in the National Assembly, a  series of man-made disasters, large-scale fraud involving banks,  setbacks in workers' welfare programs and delay in revising  labor laws, failure to carry out a pledge to allocate 5 percent  of Gross National Product (GNP) for education, and personnel  management based on personal links.</p>

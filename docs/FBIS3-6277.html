			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Weekly news conference of President Fidel V. Ramos with </F> domestic and foreign correspondents at Malacanang Palace in  Manila--live, italicized passages in Tagalog]    [Excerpts] [Correspondent] Sir, in all your past foreign  visits, the thrust was to attract investors to invest in the  Philippines. In your forthcoming visit to Vietnam, what would  be the thrust considering that the Vietnamese are not in a  position to invest here in the Philippines?    [Ramos] Why, am I going to Vietnam? [laughter] Anyway,  seriously speaking, Ellen, in all of our trips, trade promotion  was just one of the major goals. But the paramount goal in all  of those trips was the improvement of bilateral relations, and  that is very important for the Philippines which is in the  center of Asia and the Pacific rim. And I think we accomplished  those objectives in 1992 and 1993.    Another major mission aside from trade promotion, investment  promotion, tourism promotion, and improvement of bilateral  relations is enhancing our regional stability, security, and  cooperation. And this is where such networks and organizations  as ASEAN, APEC [Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation], EAGA [East  ASEAN Growth Area], and now the newly formed ARF which is the  ASEAN Regional Forum which includes the dialogue partners of  ASEAN participating in the discussion now of defense and  security matters which is unprecedented in the more than 25  years of the existence of ASEAN, are matters of extreme  importance to the Philippines.    Now, of course, it is always nice if you can bring in  investments. But in the case of Vietnam, which is the example  that you are citing, we must make sure that our bilateral issues  pertaining to the restoration of our very close cooperation and  goodwill are restored. I think I can safely say that among the  countries in ASEAN, it was the Philippines that had very close  relations with the Indo-Chinese states of Vietnam, Cambodia, and  Laos. And this dates back to the early 50s during the time of  President Ramon Magsaysay. And that is why the name Filipino in  Vietnam, for instance, is associated with being number one. You  ask (Percy Picardo) there who was in Vietnam with me.  What they said in Vietnam is Filotan number one.  Filotan means Filipino. And it's not only because of that  assistance that was given by President Magsaysay, but also the  initiatives of our socio-civic and veterans organizations. The  likes of the Freedom Company; the (Instance) Construction; the  OB, or Operations for Brotherhood, still are highly regarded  institutions there. So, this is something that we want to renew  and certainly enhance.    Now, another important reason is we are all neighbors,  claimants in a certain area of the South China Sea, collectively  now called the Spratlys. I think it is important to pursue  again the commitments to the peaceful, joint development, and  exploration of the Spratlys. For your information, among the  claimants there, it is the Philippines and the Vietnamese that  are in closest contact. It's just almost as close as from here  to Makati [Philippines' financial district]; the islands  that we are occupying are very near. So it's important to  make sure that the commitments made in the Manila Declaration of  July 1992, which was the foreign ministerial meeting that we  hosted at that time and in which the dialogue partners also made  similar commitments, be strengthened by these visits.    You should also realize that we have hosted tens of  thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of Vietnamese refugees  -- the so-called boat people -- in Palawan, in Morong,  Paranaque, and other places. And again, there must be some kind  of a dialogue that should take place as to the future of these  Vietnamese nationals.    There is the matter also of complimentation of our products  and raw materials. While generally it is true that we have a  similar kind of economy with Vietnam, similar products, and  agricultural and mineral resources, there is complimentation  that could take place, meaning cooperation to the mutual benefit  of both. Inasmuch as right now we are at a higher developmental  stage, if you are looking at the entire spectrum of human  skills, education, health and medical services, management,  banking, and financial services, as well as infrastructure for  transportation, communications, etcetera. [passage omitted]    [Correspondent] Sir, the Thai foreign minister when he was  here about a week ago, mentioned about the possibility of  getting together the leaders of ASEAN and the Indo-Chinese  states?    [Ramos] Minister Prasong?    [Correspondent] Yes, Sir.    [Ramos] Well, as you may recall, I said that already in my  speech last May, in the PBEC -- Pacific Basin Economic Council  in Seoul -- which was hosted by Korea. Prime Minister Mahathir  and I in fact spoke from the same platform on the same morning,  and that was the thrust of my message. The CAN concept --  C-A-N, Community of Asian Nations -- was officially proposed by  me. And this one is a follow-up of that, this one of Foreign  Minister Prasong.    [Correspondent] Sir, will this not be a block within, say,  APEC?    [Ramos] I'll just give you a copy of that speech last May  because it's all described there.    [Correspondent] Sir, thank you.

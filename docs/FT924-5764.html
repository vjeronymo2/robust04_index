			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / A facelift for Auntie: The policy outlined in the green paper on the BBC threatens the corporation with genteel decline Many viewers and listeners must be wondering why the BBC's future is yet again up for debate; after all, there is little evidence of widespread public discontent with the radio and television services provided by the corporation. But with its 15-year royal charter due to expire on December 31 1996, action is inevitable. The question is: should the new charter involve radical change or comfortable continuity? Will Britain be best served for another 15 years by a vertically integrated corporation with more than 20,000 employees, two TV channels, five or six national radio services and a thick network of local radio stations, all of it funded by a licence fee on TV set ownership. The fundamental case in favour of continuity is that the market cannot provide a service of BBC range and quality anywhere near so efficiently. The BBC, its defenders argue, is a worldwide success story and one of the glories of British popular culture; it is also a bulwark against the domination of the UK media by global barons, whose motivation is commercial and whose political centre of gravity may not, collectively, be that of the nation's. Also, the BBC remains popular - it is used by more than 90 per cent of households at least once a week - and relatively cheap. For Pounds 80 a year or 22p a day, it costs less than a first-class stamp or a copy of the Daily Mirror. Its stability is also valued by its competitors. With the new ITV franchise holders about to commence operations in January, some burdened with over-optimistic revenue projections, many ITV bosses think the BBC should be left alone, to supply quality competition as a benchmark for ITV and, of course, to keep the BBC's fingers out of the advertising pie. Even the satellite broadcasters, led by Rupert Murdoch, have softened their attacks on the BBC, perhaps fearing a new broadcasting regime which might free the BBC to compete more effectively in satellite and subscription services. These conservative sentiments in the BBC debate are also, more or less, in political vogue. Mrs Thatcher, who alternately terrorised and disdained the corporation, is gone. Mr Major and his senior colleagues are open in their admiration and, already well endowed with controversies, unlikely to seek another one by dismantling the BBC. That is why the green paper published yesterday is such a cautious document. Unlike, for example, the study of the BBC by the Peacock Committee in 1986 and the Broadcasting White Paper which followed it in 1988, the green paper does not take seriously the idea of a change in the way the BBC is funded. Broadcasting House's response, which is due tomorrow, is expected to accept the paper's proposed terms of engagement and confines itself to proposing reforms of limited scope, such as improving efficiency and amending the corporation's governance. The upshot seems certain to be a continuation of the licence fee, rising at slightly less than the rate of inflation, supporting a more or less unchanged range of services, albeit with a slightly more upmarket and distinctive flavour. To fill the small gap created by an RPI minus X annual uprating of the licence fee, the BBC will need to raise more money from other activities, such as selling its programmes to other broadcasters, and to make itself more efficient. It is a perfectly workable plan. But those who admire the BBC and want its sort of programmes to continue to be made and broadcast well into the next century ought to question this new consensus, which is in danger of fixing the BBC on a path of genteel decline. The root of the trouble is the licence fee, to which the BBC has a fatal addiction. The problem is that consumers want additional broadcasting services, by cable and satellite. Already 3m homes are connected to these new broadcasters and if you add to these 'subscription services' other forms of television, such as video, the licence fee starts to appear a fragile figure in the broadcasting landscape. According to projections carried out for the BBC (see chart), subscription revenues for the industry will this year surpass those raised by the licence fee for the first time; by 2000, they will be double licence fee revenues. In households which have cable and satellite TV, the BBC is today winning a viewing share of less than 30 per cent, compared with the 47 to 48 per cent it has traditionally taken of the ITV-BBC duopoly market. With commendable frankness, these same BBC studies project that even with a fully RPI-linked licence fee, the BBC's share of the national TV audience will have fallen from the 48 per cent in the late 1980s to 30 per cent in 2000 and about 20 per cent by 2010. It is impossible to imagine those who draft the next charter for the BBC at about that time supporting a poll tax of the airwaves to pay for services of such minority appeal. The market economist's response to this scenario might well be: fine, by then Britain will have a profusion of channels and the licence fee and the BBC can happily be allowed to wither away. Britain would then have US-style TV; if it wanted a tax-funded broadcaster at all, it should only be a US-style operation, meeting minority, mainly highbrow needs. At the other end of the spectrum, there are those who argue that the correct response to this dilemma is simply to give the BBC more money - RPI plus X, rather than minus. But this hardly seems politically credible, even if it were desirable: one legitimate aim of broadcasting policy is to widen the creative base of British broadcasting. This is at least as strong an argument as its direct opposite: that Britain needs a strong BBC as a kind of cultural hearthrug where the country can receive entertainment and information in a way that binds and stimulates the nation. A more plausible response is to say that the American-style broadcasting scene is not for Britain: given that even the huge economic resources of the US have been able to support, in TV terms, a great deal more mediocrity than excellence. For its size, Britain's broadcasting industry has sustained a high and acknowledged level of quality. But how could this broadcasting service be funded, if not by a licence fee? The short answer is from a mixture of sources, as public broadcasting services are in many other countries, so that all its financial (and therefore political) eggs are not in one basket. Of course, this is not a straightforward matter, since attention must be paid to the effect of limited access to advertising for, say BBC 1, Radio 1 (pop music) and Radio 2 (light music) on their commercial competitors. The same is true of subscription. It may well be that BBC 2 in something like its present form could be funded directly by a mix of subscription and advertising in the next decade. Or it may be that the BBC has a contribution to make by launching new services on satellite, making fuller use of its expertise and large resource base in certain areas: perhaps an arts channel, a children's channel or a news channel, perhaps involving the kind of alliances with other UK broadcasters from which the BBC is currently barred. There is also no reason why BBC TV, which must now take a quarter of its programmes from independents, should not itself sell programmes to other terrestrial broadcasters. The point is that the BBC needs to be as creatively free and strong as possible. An institution doomed to genteel decline, with continuously shrinking resources, is unlikely to be brimming with self-confidence or able to attract the best talent. Likewise, the BBC needs managerial freedom, not only to deal with its notorious overmanning and top-heavy bureaucracy, but to chase new markets, to seek new horizons. The obvious way forward is some form of privatisation, within an appropriate framework of regulation and accountability. It will be objected that a privatised BBC would be compelled to become exactly like ITV - driven by ratings to make only safe, bankable programmes. This would be true only if the BBC followed ITV into total reliance upon advertising, something as impractical as it is undesirable. If the BBC were to be funded partly by advertising, partly by subscription and partly by subsidy, perhaps delivered by a public service broadcasting council also empowered to support worthwhile public service broadcasting activities on other channels, it would acquire an autonomy it has sometimes lacked. It would also have the chance to make as important a contribution in broadcasting's second century as it did in its first. There is another point. Since the National Freight Corporation was privatised with great success in 1982, hardly any serious thought has been given to the place of employee share-ownership in the privatisation process. If an employee-driven privatisation scheme can work well in road haulage, then why not for the BBC, where a decisive asset will always be the quality of its management and its staff. Such a change would need careful planning and timing and could even be applied selectively; what is right for Radio One is not necessarily best for Radio Three. By 2005, Britain might have a thriving terrestrial commercial television service, an enlarged satellite and cable sector and a BBC, still partly funded from the public purse, vigorously playing its part in all these areas, as well as in domestic and global radio. This BBC would take its place within a single regulatory framework for the whole of broadcasting. There would, of course, be a risk that a new BBC would make mistakes, perform badly, lose money and decline. That would be the risk, but at least it would be a risk placed squarely on the shoulders of BBC staff and shareholders. One thing is certain: the corporation's staff would no longer resist efficient working practices or tolerate a superfluous bureaucracy.

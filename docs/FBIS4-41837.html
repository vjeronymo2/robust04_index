			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 29 TASS -- ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI carries an  article headlined "The privatisation cheque is going. What  remains?" in view of the cheque phase of privatisation ending on  Thursday.    Giving the Russian property committee's positive appraisal  of  the privatisation phase, the newspaper points out at the same  time that the evaluation is "in sharp contrast" to other points  of view. Generalising them, the newspaper writes that  privatisation "has not brought the expected results either for  the work collectives, the state or main social groups of the  population".    Referring to extreme estimates, the newspaper notes that  only  "a comparatively small group of corrupt officials and members of  shadow-economy and criminal outfits closely connected with them"  benefitted from it.    Nevertheless, the newspaper favours taking into  consideration  a "more weighed conclusion: the qualitative (or formal) results  of the privatisation are impressive. The privatisation cheques,  while not resolving many problems, still substantially promoted  the formation of a stock market". Although a widely  representative class of genuine proprietors has not yet emerged,  "privatisation has expedited the formation of a market  mechanism".    PRAVDA runs a report, headlined "The Moscow voucher  (privatisation cheque) will die somewhat later", on a Moscow  government decision to extend the privatisation period in the  country's capital until January 1, next year.    At the same time the newspaper maintains that "136,000  privatisation unclaimed by Muscovites will be used for the  purpose of providing the social protection of citizens.  [sentence as recieved] Besides, another two to four million  privatisation cheques are kept by Muscovites who could not  decide where to invest them.    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA reports Tuesday's meeting between  Russian  President Boris Yeltsin and foreign companies' executives whom  he assured that "a favourable investment climate has taken shape  in Russia". The newspaper quotes him as saying that the notion  of Russia as a country with a high degree of political risk "has  already become out-of-date".    KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (Red Star) summarises remarks by President  Yeltsin, supreme commander-in-chief of the Russian Armed Forces,  and Defence Minister Pavel Grachev at a reception of military  academies' graduates in the Kremlin Palace of Congresses on  Tuesday. The newspaper points out that more than 7,000 young  officers will join the Russian Army and Navy.    KRASNAYA ZVEZDA, runs a report under the headline "From now  on Russia and NATO headquarters will maintain friendly  relations", on Defence Minister Pavel Grachev's Tuesday meeting  with visiting General George Joulwan, NATO Supreme Allied  Commander, Europe, and an accord reached that the Russian  Defence Ministry will open a permanent mission at the NATO  allied headquarters soon and NATO will send its representatives  to the Russian Defence Ministry.    KRASNAYA ZVEZDA carries an interview with General of the  Army  Makhmut Gareyev, Dr. of military sciences, the author of a  number of books and 200 scientific articles conveying his views  about nuclear weapons and their place in ensuring Russia's  military security.    KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA reports that 3,000 children from the  Chernobyl disaster-affected areas left by air for Denmark and  Norway for medical treatment last Sunday. The report is  headlined "The first Russian landing party at a NATO airfield".    Although more than eight years have passed since the tragedy  at the Chernobyl nuclear power station, "children are born and  grow up in contaminated areas in Bryansk, Tula, Kursk and other  regions. Chernobyl kids have in their organisms the radioactive  legacy of 1986".    The press highlights materials concerning Russian-Indian  relations and the forthcoming official visit of Indian Prime  Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao. The visit begins on Wednesday.    ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI and NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA carry Rao's  interviews in which he points that despite the changes which  have taken place in the two countries in recent years, "the  traditionally close friendship between India and Russia remains  unchanged." India seeks to revitalise traditional contacts with  Russia, the Indian prime minister emphasised.    TRUD on the presidential election in Ukraine:    The postponement for almost 24 hours of the Central  Electoral  Commission's official communique, announcing whom the electorate  preferred out of seven contenders for the presidency, is  indicative of a "rather acute and uncompromising struggle  between candidates and between their supporters". As a result  of the first round of elections, the Ukraine's incumbent  President Leonid Kravchuk is ahead of ex-premier Leonid Kuchma.    PRAVDA carries an interview with prominent scientist  Vladimir  Gorshenin who voiced the conviction that the Soviet Union would  re- emerge but in a different form, of course. A reunification  of our peoples is "the primary condition for independence.  Almost everyone has already come to realise that..." Gorshenin  said.</p>

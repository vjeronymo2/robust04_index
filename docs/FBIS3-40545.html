			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Matsushita Electronic Industrial Co. Ltd. has  developed a DC-type, 26-inch (896 x 512 pixel) color plasma  display. With an improved operating life of 10,000 hours, and  increased brightness of 150 cd/m[.sup]2[/], the new display  meets the requirements for practical usage. The problem of short  lifespan was resolved by adding a resistor to each display cell  which comprises a picture element. By passing the discharge  current through the resistor, the current can be limited;  thereby improving the efficiency of light emission. This results  in extended lifespan. Brightness was increased by extending the  application of phosphor from the bottom of the cell to the  sidewalls of the cell.    Flat panel displays are generally used in two types of  applications. The first is in office equipment such as personal  computer and workstation displays, and the second is in  audio/visual type uses such as in flat televisions. For the  office applications, liquid crystal panels have already come  into practical use. However, using liquid crystal panels for  audio/visual applications has not been practical due to the  panels' limited screen size. Development of 20-inch (diagonal)  and larger panels has been underway.    The plasma display panel (PDP) has drawn attention as a  possible candidate for flat panel televisions because it can be  produced in large sizes (40-inch), and because due to its wide  angle of visibility, can be viewed from an angle. However,  commercialization lagged behind that of the liquid crystal panel  because of problems with low light emission efficiency, dark  screen, and short operating life.    In 1993, the color PDP finally arrived on the market.  Fujitsu  began selling an AC-type 21-inch color PDP having a lifespan of  10,000 hours or more, and screen brightness of 200  cd/m[.sup]2[/].[.sup]1)[/] The operating life of this  product rivals that of the CRT, and brightness also approaches  that of the CRT. Subsequently, Matsushita Electronic Industrial  Co., together with NHK at the NHK Broadcasting Laboratory,  developed a DC-type 26-inch color PDP having a brightness of 150  cd/m[.sup]2[/] and a life of 10,000 hours, with a view toward  commercialization. Large panels can be easily produced since the  vacuum film growth process needed for AC-type panels is not  required for the DC-type panel.    At present, DC-type panels are being developed by  Matsushita,  Oki Electric Industrial Co., and Dainippon Insatsu, with efforts  focused at the NHK Broadcasting Laboratory. One objective is to  achieve a practical 55-inch panel which can be used for  high-definition TV broadcasting of the Winter Olympics to be  held in Nagano in 1998. However, the immediate goal is to  achieve by 1995 a practical 30-inch panel which can be used for  EDTV II broadcasting or for the current NTSC TV broadcasting  system. Resolving the problems of brightness and lifespan with  the new 26-inch panel brings achieving this goal one step closer.  <H5>  Phosphor Emits Light Using Ultraviolet Rays </H5>   In the color PDP, ultraviolet rays are generated by gas  discharge, and they are injected into the phosphor to enable a  color display. The panel consists of two glass plates facing  each other with a gap of about 200 m between. Gas is sealed  inside this gap (see Figure 1). Electrode lines are formed in  the glass plates for alignment, and a single display cell is  defined by the intersection of these lines. Red, green, and blue  phosphor is applied to each display cell according to the  arrangement shown in Table 1. Each display cell is separated  from other cells by a partition to form a very small discharge  tube. The partition maintains the spacing between glass plates  and also prevents color smear between display cells.         -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 1.

Structure of the 26-Inch Pulse Memory DC PDP. </FIG>    A gas which radiates ultraviolet rays is used for the color  PDP. The new panel uses a mixture of helium (95%) and  xenon  (5%) gas. Although the discharge gas is almost colorless,  xenon  emits 147nm ultraviolet rays. These ultraviolet rays excite the  phosphor, resulting in the generation of visible light. For the  phosphor, an improved type of that used in fluorescent lamps for  illumination purpose is used. With the phosphor ordinarily used  in fluorescent lighting, mercury atoms emit a peak excitation in  254nm wavelength ultraviolet rays. When this is shifted toward  the shorter wavelength side, it can be used for the PDP. The  aspect ratio of the screen is 16:9, to match high definition  broadcasting. Display size is about 670mm (26-inches diagonal),  which roughly rivals a 28-inch type CRT display. The pixels  (cells) are arranged in a ``quartet'' configuration, with each  side of the square being 0.65mm. 512 cells are arranged  vertically and 896 are aligned horizontally to make up the  screen.  <H5>  Field is Divided into Eight Parts for Gradient Display </H5>   The panel is driven by means of a pulse memory system (see  Figure 2).[.sup]2)[/] While a voltage (maintenance pulse)  which does not cause discharge is applied to all cells, a write  pulse having the voltage needed to initiate discharge of only  desired cells is input synchronously with a scanning pulse. Once  initiated, discharge continues by means of the maintenance pulse  voltage. To discontinue the discharge, a pulse voltage lower  than the maintenance pulse is input. (This is called the cancel  pulse.) If this PDP were to be driven using a simple matrix  system (time division system), the maximum duty ratio (display  time ratio) would be 1/512. Since the light emission period is  short, sufficient brightness cannot be achieved. When the pulse  memory system is used, the display discharge can be continued  for a fixed time by means of the maintenance pulse, so  illumination time can be extended. This is the advantage of the  pulse memory system.    <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007LC-48B>           Figure 2.  Drive Waveforms in the Pulse Memory System. </FIG>      The scanning pulse and subsequent maintenance voltage is  applied consecutively to each of the 512 cathodes. During this  time, a maintenance pulse is applied constantly to the anode.  The maintenance pulse and the scanning pulse are out of phase  with each other, and discharge does not begin when only one or  the other pulse is applied. To cause the display discharge, a  write pulse which is synchronized with the scanning pulse is   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007LC-49A>  Figure 3. Principle of 256 Gradient Display by Subfield Division. </FIG>  applied to the anode. The voltage difference between electrodes  which occurs due to the write pulse and the scanning pulse must  be set higher than the discharge initiation voltage.    When a system such as this is used to drive the panel, the  display time for one field of each cell is fixed. In other  words, one field can display no more than two gradients. For  multiple gradient display, the field must be divided into  several sub-fields, as shown in Figure 3.       To achieve 256 gradient display, it is necessary to divide  each field into eight subfields. The display time for each  subfield is proportionate to 1, 2, ... 128. Combining these  eight subfields makes it possible to achieve gradient display of  256 steps.    However, in order to scan 512 cathodes for one of one  subfield, the period t of the scanning pulse must be  within the following:    t = (1/60) x (1/512) x (1/8) = 4 x  10[.sup]-6[/] (seconds)    In other words, discharge must start up within 1  microsecond.  To achieve this, discharge starters located in auxiliary cells  between display cells are kept constantly illuminated. With the  help of the auxiliary discharge, the discharge startup time can  be kept at 1 microsecond or less, enabling display of 256  gradients.  <H5>  Lifespan of 10,000 Hours, Brightness of 150 cd/m </H5> [.sup]2[/]    Table 2 shows the performance of the new 26-inch panel  relative to former panels. In former panels, the largest  problems were lifespan and efficiency of light emission.  Lifespan is defined here as the point where a drop is reached of  50% or more in brightness (relative to initial  brightness) when  the PDP is continuously and fully illuminated. During use, the  phosphor and glass of the PDP becomes contaminated, resulting in  a decrease in brightness. This happens because during display,  ion collide in the gas enclosed at the cathode surface, and the  cathode materials becomes dispersed (sputtered).       -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 2. Performance of the 26-Inch Pulse Memory Type DC Plasma Display Pane-|  |l. Although lifespan is currently 10,000 hours for the 26-inch panel, this h-|  |as been extended to 30,000 hours in a long-life 8-inch panel. Life is also e-|  |xpected to increase to 30,000 hours in the future for the 26-inch panel. Wit-|  |h regard to power consumed in the drive circuit section, the drive circuit h-|  |as not yet been made into an IC for the 26-inch panel, so no comparison can  |  |be made. For a prototype 40-inch panel developed at the same time, former po-|  |wer consumption was 400W; this has been lowered to 100W in a 1993 version.   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                         |Former (1992 Electronics |New (1993 NHK Technology |  |                         |Show)                    |Exhibition)              |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Brightness               |100 cd/m[.sup]2[/]     |150 cd/m[.sup]2[/]     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Contrast                 |10:1                     |10:1                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Life                     |1000 hours               |10,000 hours             |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Discharge Current        |150 A               |60 A                |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Light Emission Efficiency|0.15 lm/W                |0.40 lm/W                |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Power Consumption of Pan-|140W                     |80W                      |  |el (except for drive cir-|                         |                         |  |cuit)                    |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      The lifespan of former color PDPs was about 1,000 hours.  This  has been extended to 10,000 hours or more with the new panel,  equaling that of the CRT. Efficiency of light emission, at 0.40  lm/W, is almost triple the former value of 0.151 lm/W. Factors  contributing to the improved lifespan and light emission  efficiency include: (1) the discharge current for each pulse has  been lowered by adding a current limiting resistor to each cell,  (2) the pressure of enclosed gas has been raised, and (3) the  phosphor, which was formerly applied only to the bottom of the  cell, is applied to the sidewalls of the cell to increase the  utility of ultraviolet rays.    By improving the light emission efficiency, brightness has  been increased and power consumption has been lowered.  Brightness has been improved from the former 100  cd/m[.sup]2[/], which is generally regarded to be at the  practical level. While the former-type panels consume about 140W  (with the exception of the circuit driver area), the new 26-inch  panel consumes 80W. As a result, the temperature rise which  occurs during use has also been limited. When using the panel at  room temperature, former panels would heat up to about 90C;  this has been reduced to about 50C in the new panels.  <H5>  Resistors Added to Each Cell </H5>   The biggest reason why the new panel has an extended  lifespan  of 10,000 hours is because a current limiting resistor has been  added to each display cell. Former-type plasma display panels  which do not have this resistor use anomalous glow discharge for  display discharge. With this method, an increase in the  discharge current is accompanied by a slight increase in the  discharge voltage, as shown in Figure 4 (a) and (b). In other  words, the discharge current can be controlled by adjusting the  applied voltage. However, when anomalous glow discharge is used,  the electrode is easily damaged by sputtering, resulting in a  shortened lifespan.      Sputtering can be reduced by increasing the pressure of gas  within the cell. Increasing this gas pressure also raises the  efficiency of light emission. However, once the gas pressure is  increased, discharge changes from anomalous glow discharge to  normal glow discharge. During normal glow discharge, the  discharge voltage remains fixed or even decreases when the  discharge current is increased, as shown in Figure 4 (c). In  cases where the voltage drops in conjunction with an increase in  current, uncontrolled discharge occurs if the current is not  limited; and the cell is destroyed. To utilize normal glow  discharge, some means of limiting the discharge current must be  devised.    Using a peripheral circuit to limit the discharge current  has  also been considered, but this is not regarded to be practical.  The number of display cells in each electrode line which will  illuminate changes, depending on the image to be reproduced.  Controlling the current according to the image would require an  extremely complex control circuit. Another way of doing this is  to add an independent resistor to each display cell. By so  doing, the discharge current can be limited without requiring a  peripheral circuit (see Figure 4 (d)).    It was known in the past that adding a resistor to each  display cell would achieve a practical lifespan for the  panel.[.sup]3)4)[/] However, since there were still numerous  other problems, and there was no suitable resistor material, a  large-size panel could not be constructed practically due to the   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007LC-50A>   Figure 4.  Normal and anomalous Glow Discharge. </FIG>  increased number of processes involved. Recent advancements have  been made in the production technology for display panels, and  peripheral techniques for resistor formation have been  established. These can now be adopted for 26-inch type panels.    Comparing the lifespan of the new panels against former  panels which did not use resistors, the usable life in former  models could not be improved by raising the gas pressure (see  Figure 5). This is because the discharge current would increase  in conjunction with an increase of the gas pressure. In  addition, gas pressure could not be increased above a certain  value due to the possibility of arc discharge. Since the new  panels have resistors to control the discharge current, the  discharge current can be managed without high pressure gas,  resulting in longer life. In an experimental panel, HeZe gas  mixture was enclosed at a pressure of 40 kPa, and discharge  current was kept at about 60 A. The brightness half-life was  extended to 10,000 hours or more.       There have also been some other fundamental experiments  underway in an effort to lengthen the usable lifespan of the  panel. The lifespan of an 8-inch panel, displayed by NHK at the  1993 Technology Exhibition, is estimated to be 30,000 hours or  more. Gas pressure has been increased to 47 kPa in this panel.  Also, the proportion of Xe gas, which controls sputtering, is  10%.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007LC-51A>           Figure 5. Lifetime of Panels with Resistors Added. </FIG>  <H5>  Accuracy of Resistance Value Assured by Etching </H5>   The key points in adding resistors involved determining what  kind of design should be used to incorporate the resistor, and  how to produce panels having complex designs.    The resistor was formed on the glass plate on the anode side  (rear side), as shown in Figure 6. The bus line from the anode  passes through the resistor and connects to the anode in the  center of the cell. An insulating layer is used to protect the  anode from resistance. Only the center part of the anode is  exposed to the discharge space because of a thru-hole situated  in the insulating layer.    <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007LC-51B>           Figure 6. Internal Cell Structure of Resistor-Added Panels. </FIG>     The new resistor-added panel can be produced by simply  adding  a resistor printing process, as shown in Figure 7. However,  since the resistors are built into display cells which are about  0.5mm square, a higher level of precision is required of the  printing process. When producing 26-inch panels, it is necessary  to achieve uniform formation of 450,000 resistors. To achieve  this degree of uniformity, (1) the shape of the electrode which  connects resistor to resistor must be precise, and (2) the  resistor material must be compatible with the electrode and  insulating film materials. In particular, conventional screen  printing does not produce sufficient precision when forming the  electrode -- therefore, a photoetch process was adopted. For the  prototype panel, a goal of plus or minus 10% was set for  uniformity of resistance values. Although the actual prototype  contained some resistors which exceeded this standard, this did  not significantly affect the display. Efforts are currently  underway to discover the causes of the variance in resistor  values.[.sup]5)[/]       RuO[.sup]2[/] paste having a sinter temperature of about  600C was used as the resistor material. The resistive paste  which is ordinarily used for hybrid ICs was not used because it  has a higher sinter temperature of about 850C, which cannot  be used with glass plates.    Each resistor has a value of about 1 M ohms. As a result,  discharge current could be greatly reduced from the former value  of 150 A to 60 A. Since photo-etching was used to  produce  the resistor-added panel, processing required a slightly more  complex procedure. Also, since the resistor sinter temperature  of 600C is higher than that used in other processes (where  temperatures up to 580C are used), there is a higher  occurrence of stress in the glass. Further study is needed to  resolve these problems.  <H5>  Phosphor Also Applied to Sidewalls of Cells </H5>   The life of the display could be extended by adding  resistors  to the cells. The remaining problem involving the brightness was  resolved by applying phosphor to the sidewalls of the display  cells, to increase the utilization of ultraviolet rays which are  generated during discharge (see Figure 8).    <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007LC-52A>  Figure 7. Production Processes for Resistor-Added Panels. </FIG>   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007LC-52B>  Figure 8. Transparent Type PDP Panel and Reflective Type PDP Panel. </FIG>     Color plasma discharge displays initially consisted of a  design where the phosphor was applied on the front side glass,  so that the emitted light could be seen through the phosphor.  The drawback in this design was that emitted light was absorbed  into the phosphor layer, resulting in reduced brightness. To  resolve this problem, a reflective-type panel was developed. It  consisted of applying phosphorous material on the rear glass,  and emitted light was viewed through the front glass. Since  there was no light absorbed by the phosphor, brightness was  improved by 1.5 times. However, since the phosphor was at the  bottom of the cell, the viewing angle was narrow.    In the new panel, phosphor has been applied to the sidewall  in addition to the bottom of the cell. By doing so, the  utilization of ultraviolet rays increases, and brightness also  more than doubles. At the same time, the viewing angle remains  the same as that of permeation-type displays. Ultraviolet rays  which struck the sidewalls were formerly not utilized. When  combining this with the drop in discharge current brought about  by adding resistors, light emission efficiency has been improved  almost three-fold, reaching 0.4 lm/W. As a result, a brightness  of 150 cd/m[.sup]2[/] can be obtained, and the average power  consumption can be reduced from the former 140 W to 80 W, with  the exception of power consumed in the circuit drive sections.    There are two problems in forming phosphor material on the  sidewalls. The first is that the panel becomes whitish because  the color of the phosphor material is white. This can be  resolved by placing red, green, and blue color filters on each  pixel, as shown in Figure 9. By adding a filter which allows  only the color of light emitted by each cell to penetrate,  reflected light can ideally be reduced to 1/3 without any drop  in brightness of the display light.    <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007LC-53A>  Figure 9. Reflection of External Light Is Prevented by Color Filters </FIG>      The second problem is the degree of complexity involved in  processing. To form phosphor on the sidewalls, the display cell  must first be covered with phosphor material, and then the  phosphor must be removed except for the sidewall areas. To  selectively remove the phosphor material, a sandblasting or  photoetching process is required.  <H5>  Mass Production Technique to Be Established </H5>   The objectives of improving longevity, brightness, and  efficiency were basically achieved about one year  ago.[.sup]6)[/] Remaining technical problems include  converting the circuit drive into an IC. Once this is achieved,  the system can be made more compact, and power consumption can  also be decreased.    In DC-type PDPs which have a pulse memory system, the  discharge voltage is 250 V or higher. This has made it difficult  to develop a monolithic IC. Recently, new drive systems which  can be used with drive IC withstand voltage of 200 V or more  have been proposed.[.sup]7)-9)[/] A bias voltage is applied  to the entire drive circuit in order to reduce the voltage to  the drive IC. At the 1993 NHK Technology Exhibition, a 40-inch  panel using the new drive system was displayed, with picture  quality that equaled the former type systems.    In the new drive system, the amplitude of the drive pulse  and  the duration of application are reduced. Therefore, the power  loss which occurs in the drive circuit section can be reduced.  In the 40-inch panel, power consumption in the drive section is  400 W when the former drive system is used. With the new drive  system, this has dropped to 100 W. When this is applied to a  26-inch panel, the average power consumption of the entire panel  can be reduced to 150 W or lower.    One more problem is the establishment of mass production  processes for large panels. Thick film technology could be  developed to achieve this. When producing large size panels, it  is beneficial to use thick film rather than thin film methods in  view of the cost of production equipment, and throughput.    There could also be areas where thin film formation  techniques can be utilized. Mass production processes will  eventually be determined by balancing yield and cost, while  comparing low cost thick-film processes to higher cost, but more  precise thin-film processes.

There are slight differences in structure between the DC and  AC systems (see Figure A). In the DC system, the opposing  electrodes are exposed to the discharge space. When voltage is  applied between the electrodes, electrons jump from the cathode  and reach the anode while gas is being ionized. Discharge is  maintained by a DC discharge current. In the AC method, the  electrodes are covered with a dielectric layer. The process is  the same as the DC method in as much as electrons pass from the  minus electrode side when voltage is applied, and gas becomes  ionized. However, since the electrodes are covered with  dielectric material and a capacitor is formed, the current stops  completely when a fixed charge moves. As implied by the name, in  the AC method, discharge is maintained by applying an AC current.       In the AC system, the charge stored in the capacitor helps  to  initiate the discharge. Therefore, a supplemental discharge cell  is not required to serve as the discharge starter. This makes it  possible to achieve a smaller cell size. However, the  disadvantage is that there is a large amount of reactive current  because AC drives a large capacity panel.    The conventional AC system has been regarded to have a  better  lifespan. In the AC system, a MgO film that resists sputtering  is formed on the dielectric layer which covers the electrodes.  However, in the DC system, since the electrodes are directly  exposed to the discharge, it is necessary to use an electrode  material which is resistant to sputtering, such as aluminum. The  AC method also has the advantage that current is automatically  limited by the capacitance of the display cell. By keeping the  discharge current below a certain value, the sputtering can be  reduced. In the case of the DC method, current must be limited  by using a resistor or constant-current circuit.    For larger size panels which adopt the AC system, a vacuum  deposition process is required to form the MgO film, thus  equipment investment and yield are not favorable. In the DC  method, thick film printing can be used to create the film, so  it is more suitable for larger screen sizes. On the other hand,  the construction of the display cell is simple in the AC method,  so precision can be more easily achieved than in the DC method.</p>

			<p>920805 FT  05 AUG 92 / 'If the Moslems do not raise the white flag on the minarets, we raze the villages to the ground. Serb villages will be built here': Judy Dempsey explains how Serb leaders are  rearranging Bosnia's population, using detention camps and a ruthless policy of ethnic cleansing IN THE north-western Bosnian city of Banja Luka, there is an institution called the 'Centre for Migration'. Since May, it has been sending out instructions to Serbian officials in towns and cities throughout Bosnia-Hercegovina. The instructions are always the same: make arrangements for the exchange of population. Set up last May, it is run by Mr Vojo Kuprasanin, Mr Radoslav Brdjanin, Mr Radislav Vukic, and Mr Predrag Radic. The four are leaders of the self-declared Serbian republic of Bosanska Krajina. They also support Bosnia's Serbian Democratic Party which is led by Mr Radovan Karadzic. In June, Mr Kuprasanin, who has since established a martial law regime in Banja Luka, asked the Serb mayor of the central Bosnian city of Zenice for a population transfer involving 30,000 Moslems and Croats. They were to be sent from Banja Luka to Zenice in return for the Zenice authorities sending 30,000 Serbs to Banja Luka. But such ad hoc rearrangements of Bosnia's ethnic make-up have been institutionalised, with the forced evacuation of tens of thousands of mostly Moslem civilians by Serbs and their confinement in detention centres, according to officials from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). It was forced to leave Bosnia at the end of May following intimidation and the killing of an aid worker. 'There is one aim behind the Serb camps: ethnic cleansing,' explained a senior US diplomat. 'Through their quest for territory, the Serbs, by placing the Moslems in camps, want eventually to expel the Moslem population and make parts of Bosnia ethnically homogeneous,' he explained. Moslems make up 43 per cent of the 4.5m population of Bosnia, Serbs 33 per cent and Croats 17 per cent. Many witnesses among the tens of thousands who have fled to neighbouring Croatia and Hungary have repeatedly confirmed these views. Although the ICRC, human rights organisations, and other international aid agencies have not been permitted to visit any of the camps, except the 'model' Serb-controlled camp at Manaca, near Banja Luka, the Serbian media have begun openly to describe the methods behind ethnic cleansing. The most recent issue of Epocha, a weekly magazine close to Serbia's ruling Socialist party, reported how Bosnia's Serbs now control large swathes of northern Bosnia through a policy of ethnic cleansing: 'This (region) is now cleared of Croats and Moslems ..our army surrounds Moslem villages. If the Moslems do not raise the white flag on the minarets, we raze the villages to the ground. Serb villages will be built here ..' If Moslems were prepared to fly the white flag, they must be prepared for an exchange of population. 'Those people not from mixed marriages can go to the territory controlled by (Bosnian president Alija) Izetbegovic, or go to Croatia. Those from mixed marriages who have not fired at Serbs, can choose to remain ..' The magazine boasted how in Kotor Varos, a town of 36,000 people east of Banja Luka, there were no longer ethnic minorities. Until recently, the town symbolised the ethnic patchwork of Bosnia: 38 per cent Serb; 30 per cent Moslem; 29 per cent Croat. Those held in Serb camps, particularly those in Omarska, north-west of Banja Luka, or Pale, east of the Bosnian capital Sarajevo, the headquarters of Mr Karadzic, are sometimes freed in exchange for Serb snipers held by Bosnia's territorial forces. Witnesses have described how they have been forcibly transported out of the republic as refugees. 'These refugees cannot come back. The whole point about ethnic cleansing is that it prevents the local inhabitants from returning. Not just because they are afraid, but because they have nothing to return to. Their homes have been completely destroyed,' a United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said. Few if any international relief agencies can confirm the number of Serb detention camps in Bosnia-Hercegovina precisely because they are not allowed to visit them, or because it is too dangerous to travel to these areas. International aid agencies also say that the Croats, and now the Moslems, are involved in ethnic cleansing. For example, western diplomats know of a Croatian camp at Konjic, west of Sarajevo, in which 3,000 Serbs were imprisoned in a rail tunnel.</p>

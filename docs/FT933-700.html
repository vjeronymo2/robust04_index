			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / Technology: Silence is golden - Electronic discussions can take the cost, disunity and lost time out of meetings The meeting seems to be endless and you are seething with frustration. Others are dominating the discussion and you cannot wait to leave, even though you have ideas which you would like to contribute. Unfortunately, the problem is a familiar one at companies and organisations the world over. All too often, it means that meetings last longer than necessary, are inconclusive, and fail to extract the best from everyone attending. This is not only annoying, it also costs money. In the US, some 11m meetings a day, adding up to 3bn a year, take place in business and government, according to the Meeting Management Institute of 3M Corporation. Meetings can swallow between 7 and 15 per cent of the personnel budget. The proportion of time that US managers spend in meetings can vary between 30 and 80 per cent. The institute cites one Fortune 500 company that wasted Dollars 71m (Pounds 46.1m) a year on 'bad meetings'. But while many people know what 'bad meetings' are - some might apply the description to all meetings - deciding how to make them enjoyable and productive is tricky. Technology cannot replace human brain power, individual eloquence and interaction between people. Yet with the intelligent use of software, meetings can be made more interesting, worthwhile, and even - a new concept for those with an antipathy to meetings - fun. 'We want to eliminate the need for face-to-face meetings, if possible, or make them more productive,' says Jay Nunamaker, chairman of Ventana, a US company specialising in meetings software, part of the computerised information-sharing process known as groupware. Nunamaker, also professor of computer science at the University of Arizona, believes 'the way we meet is going to change'. As companies come under increasing pressure to develop products and services more rapidly to compete with rivals, more streamlined meetings to save time and money will be required. Experience with Ventana's product, GroupSystems, has shown that its use can enable some team projects to be completed in half the time taken in traditional meetings - a 90 per cent cut has been achieved in some cases. Typical applications include programmes geared towards business process re-engineering, quality improvement and personnel management. The way that GroupSystems works appears simple, though the software is complex. Those at the meeting - usually brought together in one room, although not necessarily - type their ideas on to a computer screen in front of them as fast as they can. They can react to other peoples' ideas as they appear and ask questions about these. Because of the anonymity conferred by the computer, no one need feel inhibited about expressing their views, however unpalatable these may be to top management. Usually, such meetings are led by facilitators who understand how the software works and can best be used. They can take the participants through stages ranging from initial brainstorming, through sorting topic categories and priorities, to evaluation and a final vote, if necessary. Since everyone can contribute views whenever they like, far more information can be generated than in normal meetings. Usually, if 15 people meet for an hour, each person has only four minutes on average to say anything. But, says Nunamaker: 'We know that about 20 per cent of people speak 80 per cent of the time.' In electronic meetings, participation is almost total. There are other benefits, too. 'We have run sessions with people who refuse to be in conventional meetings with each other,' says Nunamaker. Software-driven meetings are also more likely to produce a result. 'Sometimes, people hold meetings to avoid making decisions, sometimes to socialise.' With methods like GroupSystems or the rival VisionQuest package developed by Texas-based Collaborative Technologies, this can be avoided. The use of electronic meeting systems gives participants access to databases within their own organisations. This can save time when a key piece of information is suddenly needed to help along a particular discussion. In addition, a full record of the meeting is readily available. Among US users of GroupSystems are IBM, AT&amp;T, the US Army - all of which helped finance its development - Boeing, the US Department of Defence, and the Federal Aviation Administration. Another is Hewlett Packard, whose information technology manager, Hudi Cantrell, says the technique has led to a 'radical improvement' in the conduct of meetings. Speed and documentation are important benefits, but more so is the all-inclusive nature of the information that results from assertive and reserved participants. 'The richness of information that results is phenomenally effective,' says Cantrell. Users of the GroupSystems facility at Hewlett Packard say they can accomplish tasks in half the usual time. Tom McMillen, director of information technology at Greyhound Financial Corporation, is also enthusiastic. 'It helps people become less focused just on their own ideas and more focused on those of others.' He reckons it has saved the company considerable time in its strategic planning process. GroupSystems is in use at 360 sites in the US, Denmark, Britain, Germany, Finland, France, Russia, Bulgaria, Hungary and elsewhere. Nunamaker says another benefit is that meetings can be much larger than previously. 'It can be as many as 70 people - this works very well.' Not all managers are easily convinced of the wisdom of running meetings by software. They have to be prepared for some tough or even unpleasant statements on the screen. 'Anonymity helps separate ideas from the politics behind them,' says Nunamaker. 'Ideas can be weighed on their merits rather than on their source.' It can come as a shock for many bosses to find that people may have totally different, and possibly more accurate, views than their own. One US general used to bang on his computer terminal with a coffee cup while demanding to be told who made critical statements. Anonymity may help in the airing of valuable views but it can also cause nasty bruises to overdeveloped egos.</p>

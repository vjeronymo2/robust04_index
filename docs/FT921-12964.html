			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / Money Markets: London rates steady TIGHT conditions returned to the UK money market yesterday in the face of another substantial liquidity shortage, with overnight money squeezed higher during the day but longer rates holding steady, writes Simon London. The Bank of England forecast a Pounds 1.15bn liquidity shortage in early morning, against Pounds 750m on Tuesday. The largest factor contributing to the drain on funds was maturing treasury bills and assistance from previous weeks at Pounds 947m. However, there was no early rush for funds from market participants. In early assistance the Bank of England injected a modest Pounds 167m, through the outright purchase of band 1 bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent and the purchase of paper for resale to the market on February 10 at 10 7/16 per cent. Later in the morning a further Pounds 116m was added, again through the purchase of band 1 bills and repurchase paper on the same terms. However, this was not enough to hold the overnight money rate steady. From an opening level of 10 3/4 - 5/8 per cent, overnight funds traded up to 13-12 1/2 per cent by early afternoon. As liquidity was squeezed operators looked to the authorities for additional assistance. In the early afternoon Pounds 337m was injected through the purchase of band 1 bank and treasury bills and band 2 bank bills, all at 10 3/8 per cent. Late assistance amounted to Pounds 485m, bringing the total injection for the day to Pounds 1.105bn. Overnight funds fell back to close at 11-10 3/4 per cent, still above Tuesday's closing level. In Frankfurt, call money continued to trade at around 9.40/9.50 per cent in spite of a net drain of funds at the Bundesbank's regular repurchase operations. The authorities offered DM9.2bn one month funds at 9.4 per cent, not fully replacing a DM13.3bn expiring repurchase pact. In Tokyo, unsecured call money traded slightly lower to 5 7/16 per cent, from 5 9/16 per cent on Tuesday, with the Bank of Japan injecting a net Y200bn in its daily operations. However, the three months certificate of deposit rate collapsed to 4.95 per cent, from 5.20 per cent on Tuesday and 5.25 per cent on Monday. Analysts said the fall reflected increased expectations of another reduction in interest rates but was exaggerated by easy market conditions, allowed by the authorities in the face of a weak stock market this week.</p>

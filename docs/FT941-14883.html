			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Triton Energy bids for UK minority Triton Energy, the ind-ependent US oil and gas company, yesterday made an offer equivalent to 37 1/2 p for the shares of UK-based Triton Europe that it does not already own. The offer values Triton Europe at Pounds 30.9m. Triton Energy already owns 59.47 per cent of the company, which wrote down the value of its oil and gas properties by Pounds 41m last September. Triton Europe's main interest lies in the Paris basin, which has been suffering from declining production. It incurred a loss of Pounds 50m for the year to May 31. The consideration will be satisfied by the issue of new unlisted 5 per cent convertible preferred stock in Triton Energy. The shares closed yesterday at 33p, up 13p. The independent directors are recommending the offer. Mr Bill Smith, one of the independent directors, said the company's exploration had proved unsuccessful and there was no liquidity in the shares. The three largest minority shareholders - Provident Mutual, Legal &amp; General and LL Capital Partners - intend to vote in favour. The three own or control 18.3 per cent of the company, or just over 45 per cent of the shares not owned by Triton Energy. Shareholders can also elect to receive cash up to a maximum of Dollars 10,000 each subject to a maximum cash outlay by Triton Energy of Dollars 2m (Pounds 1.3m).</p>

			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / International Company News: Pasminco calls off Korea Zinc joint venture Pasminco, the Australian zinc producer, has called off its proposed joint venture agreement with Korea Zinc, the zinc smelting group, over the Elura zinc-lead mine near Cobar, in New South Wales. The proposed deal, announced in March, envisaged that Korea Zinc would pay around ADollars 40m (USDollars 29.4m) for a 40 per cent interest in the mine  -ADollars 27m up front, and the remainder when the mine was upgraded. Pasminco would then have taken about 60 per cent of the output to supply its Australian smelters.

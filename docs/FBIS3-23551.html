Documentary evidence proving this fact is in the  hands of the Federal Counterintelligence Service [FCS], which  was the first to pay attention to the strange behavior -- to put  it mildly -- by officials in the Russian Armed Forces.    The ill-starred mercenaries, who have already left the army  of sovereign Azerbaijan, are today unanimously talking about an  entirely legal recruitment campaign for contract servicemen  which was launched by the oblast military commissariats at the  end of last year. Judging by the advertisements that were  posted, the call was to service in CIS "hotspots." The terms  were tempting: 500,000 rubles [R] per month, one-half of this  sum in dollars. It did not occur to any of the dozens of people  who fell for these promises that the recruitment was not to the  Russian Army but to the armed forces of another state. The  volunteers did not immediately realize what they were joining,  even after a visit to the military commissariat. Some read the  terms for themselves, while others were kept in the dark until  the last moment. One thing unites them all -- when flying out  to Baku every one of them knew where they were going and what  for.    A. and N. from Kaluga (the editorial office has their full  details) were immediately given to understand what was going on  by staffers of Kaluga's Leninskiy Rayon Military Commissariat,  who said: "Go to Azerbaijan as mercenaries. You will be able  to get a large sum of money. War is of course a risk, but you  can make a profit from it...." When the volunteers were brought  to the assembly point, there were around 60 men already there  from various rayons in the oblast. Addressing them, A. and N.  recall, the oblast military commissar did not speak about  Azerbaijan, but only said that where the detachment was going  "people only died through stupidity." He did not give a direct  answer to the question: "Are we going to Azerbaijan?",  reporting that representatives of the recipient military unit  would arrive in the next few days, and they would explain  everything.    B. from Kaluga came to the Oktyabrskiy Rayon Military  Commissariat following an appeal on local television by a  staffer of the Oblast Military Commissariat, who announced the  recruitment of reservists for service in CIS "hotspots."  Convinced that this concerned the Russian Army, B. arrived in  the city of Yefremov, where the Kaluga volunteers were united  with the Tambov volunteers. There, for the first time, he saw  the "representative of the recipient military unit," elderly  Azerbaijani Guseynov, wearing badges of military rank unknown to  B. on his military tunic under his civilian coat. In  mid-December, the combined detachment went via Moscow to Ivanovo  airport, where they united with the contract servicemen from  Ivanovo and Vladimir. On 20 December, 92 mercenaries flew out  to Baku by an Azerbaijani civil aviation Tu-154.    According to Ch. from Kaluga, the recruitment of volunteers  was done with the most active participation of officials of the  oblast military commissariat, who closely cooperated with  representatives of the Azerbaijani Army. However, as a rule,  neither the Russian military nor their foreign colleagues  enlarged on the ultimate aim of the impending visit. They even  kept silent when all the volunteers knew the truth. The  Azerbaijanis, the mercenaries recall, freely made use of the  military commissariat reservists' discount cards, bought them  food in cafes using cash, and apparently did not suffer from any  shortage of funds. [passage omitted]    All the former mercenaries questioned by the FCS are  convinced that the oblast military commissars and their  subordinates who were working directly with the contract  servicemen could not have failed to realize that they were  assisting in the recruitment of Russian citizens to a foreign  army. That they participated in deceiving volunteers who did  not initially suspect where they were going to serve. The  aforementioned A. stated that staffers of local military  commissariats had "set up" the volunteers, that all the  Azerbaijanis' conversations with the mercenaries were conducted  in the presence of Russian military, and the latter responded  immediately to the requests of "the representatives of the  military unit"....[passage omitted]    Although not a single legislative act mentions the concept  of  "mercenary" at the moment, according to many of my interlocutors  from the FCS, the actions of the military commissariats fully  come under Article 171 of the Russian Federation Penal Code,  which covers cases when officials exceed their power and  authority to the detriment of Russia's interests. No matter  which side we look from, the damage is clear: The country may  be accused of supporting the idea of mercenaries, while the  Russian Army failed to recruit all the contract servicemen which  it might have recruited. Meanwhile, the Russian Federation  Armed Forces command is apparently not noticing the December  "recruitment," just like it did not notice such cases in the  past. As [counterintelligence officer] Vladimir Makarov claims,  the "signals" about the flourishing mercenary business had  already reached the military department, the former Supreme  Soviet, and the Prosecutor's Office.    On 23 February, the FCS leadership (let us note that the  department managed to "unravel" this story in a situation  extremely unfavorable to itself, straight after the president's  December edict on abolishing the Russian Ministry of Security)  officially sent a letter to Colonel General M. Kolesnikov, chief  of the Russian Federation Armed Forces General Staff, setting  forth all the circumstances of the case. The IZVESTIYA  editorial office is also waiting for the reply.    When called by IZVESTIYA, Mikhail Petrovich Kolesnikov, with  whom we are well acquainted because of the January 1990 events  in Baku, answered that he does not know anything about the  involvement of Russian military commissariats in the recruitment  of mercenaries for the Azerbaijani Army. He considers claims  about such cases as someone's conjectures, and the conversation  essentially premature. "When we obtain documents from the FCS,  we will conduct our own investigation, and then we will return  to this subject...."</p>

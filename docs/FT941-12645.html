			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (18): The Chinese rediscover their postal heritage - Alternative investments, starting in stamps, 2 / The second article in this quarterly series considers the attractions of the Far East for collectors - and in particular the growing importance of the world's next economic giant It is just possible that the stamp world is about to enter its first period of genuine expansion for many decades. China is rapidly growing more prosperous, and the signs are that the Chinese will spend some of their new wealth on stamps. Many Chinese in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore have already caught the stamp bug; and China itself had millions of collectors before the advent of communism and the Cultural Revolution, when to own foreign stamps was a serious offence. Now, with greater freedom, some observers expect that within a decade or so there could be as many stamp collectors in China as in the US. At least at first, their interest will be concentrated on Chinese stamps. Already these, like the stamps of other far eastern countries, have become the most sought after sector of the market. Twenty years ago, Chinese stamps were valued little more than paper; now, anyone with a good collection can afford to wait and watch prices rise and rise. Some indication of the interest in Chinese stamps was provided by Sotheby's auction of Major James Starr's collection in 1991. It was reckoned to be among the four or five best of China in the world, and was estimated to make Pounds 800,000-Pounds 1m. It sold for Pounds 2m., with all the 993 lots finding buyers. The rarest item, a Dollars 1 on 3 cents stamp of 1897, of which only 32 are known to survive, was forecast at Pounds 80,000. It sold to a Taiwanese collector for Pounds 132,000. Ten years ago this stamp would have cost less than Pounds 10,000. There was a slight dip in demand as collectors restored their finances after such a splurge, but now Chinese stamps have resumed their upward spiral. Last March, a presentation set of Chinese stamps, estimated at Pounds 40,000, sold for Pounds 133,500, also to Taiwan. There is undoubtedly an investment element in the purchases (the Hong Kong Chinese store their collections away from the colony as its absorption into China approaches), but in the main the Chinese seem genuine collectors of their past postage. Moreover, unlike many former colonised countries, the Hong Kong Chinese are equally happy to buy Hong Kong stamps of the imperial period, and have a keen eye for rarities. A routine Queen Victoria Hong Kong stamp might sell for Pounds 10, but one cancelled in one of the more obscure Treaty ports on the South China coast could go for up to Pounds 50,000. This enthusiastic buying by the Chinese makes things hard for British, American and continental collectors of Chinese and Hong Kong stamps. (The finest collection is owned by a Swedish banker, and is valued at up to Pounds 30m). For example, a Queen Victoria colonial cover usually costs about Pounds 100: a Hong Kong colonial cover is nearer Pounds 1,000. Of course, it does mean that anyone who built up a collection a generation ago has secured a very good investment. The big stamp auctioneers, like Sotheby's, Christie's and Phillips, and the leading dealers, like Stanley Gibbons, expect no falling away in Chinese demand. They have before them the example of Thailand, which is currently stamp mad. A recent stamp exhibition there attracted a crowd of 500,000: in the UK, a similar event would be doing well if 15,000 attended. The prices of some Thai stamps have risen thirtyfold as the new rich buy up the national hegemony. Even though Thai postal history is straightfoward and relatively unexciting, with few great rarities, demand is still forcing prices higher. Most of the nations of south-east Asia have enjoyed an economic boom, and some of the new prosperity has gone into stamp collecting, invariably of the postage of the nation - Japanese collect Japan; Thais, Thailand, and so on. Some nations still await the experience - South Korea is mysteriously slow, and there must be potential in Indonesia and the Phillipines. Some of the nations, like South Korea, have a quite boring postal history, which could hold back interest. Others, like North Korea, are as frozen as China 20 years ago. Brunei may contain the richest man in the world, but he is no stamp collector, and there is nothing in the state's postal history to set the pulse racing. One problem is that newly independent nations are not particularly attached to the postal arrangements of their former European overlords. This is the situation in Malaysia, Indonesia, and Vietnam, where the early stamps are still collected minly by the British, Dutch and the French respectively, in a mood of colonial nostalgia. These tend to be quiet markets, inhibited by the paucity of good material, and relatively few buyers. Singapore is rather similar. For a couple of thousand pounds you could complete a set of the Singaporean postage; but quite a few collectors have the same ambition, so demand is brisk. Japan is a strong market. Against the global trend, it is young people in Japan who are the keenest collectors. Some Japanese industrialists have invested millions in amassing important collections of the stamps of the US and even the UK, which is venerated as the fount of postal history. This is partly because stamps came late to Japan, in the 1870s, and the postage is straightforward. Japanese postal history offers greater scope for collectors. There is, however, one Japanese stamp, from the first issue, which has its centre inverted. It is believed to be unique, and could sell for Pounds 1m if it appeared on the market. The rich Japanese like to spread their wealth around many investment markets, and stamps is one beneficiary. Many pre-1900 stamps of the Far East are in collections in the west, and often turn up as overlooked discoveries. This is the part of the album that the experts turn to first. But now the stamps are returning home. They can fetch much higher prices in Hong Kong and Bangkok than in London, and there are dealers that specialise in the repatriation. The problem is that the increase in prices has helped to dry up the supply. Owners of good collections expect even higher values. The troubles of the Japanese economy in 1993 should alert them to the fact that the far eastern boom will not necessarily last for ever. In the next issue of the Review, Antony Thorncroft will discuss the stamps of countries that comprise the American continent.</p>

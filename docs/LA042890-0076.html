			<p><P> April 28, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GROWTH DISCOVERED ON POLHILL'S VOCAL CORDS; BIOPSY PLANNED  </P> <P> Freed hostage Robert Polhill has a growth on his vocal cords, a doctor  disclosed Friday, as a silent Polhill said through his wife that he hoped soon  to be welcoming others home from captivity in Lebanon.  </P> <P> Polhill, in a statement read for him by his Lebanese-born wife, Firyal, said he  and his family hoped his release Sunday marked "the beginning of the end to the  hostage situation."  </P> <P> A biopsy is to be performed soon, probably early next week, to see if the  growth on his vocal cords is a tumor or an infection, said Dr. Russ Zajtchuk,  deputy commander of clinical services at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, where  Polhill is being treated.  </P> <P> Polhill's wife described him as "physically weak but mentally very, very  strong."  </P> <P> She read his statement and answered questions outside the hospital where her  husband arrived Thursday for a stay that doctors said could last as long as  three to four weeks. After his release, Polhill spent three days in another  Army hospital in Wiesbaden, West Germany, before being flown to Washington.  </P> <P> "I regret that, at the moment, I am unable to thank you more directly and  personally," Polhill said in the prepared statement. "But my voice decided to  go on vacation before I did.  </P> <P> "However, I do want you to know how very much I appreciate the warmth and  sincerity of your welcome and the support you've given my wife and family, who  join me in hoping that this is the beginning of the end to the hostage  situation.  </P> <P> "I am, happily, now free to join you in your continued support for the loved  ones of those who remain in captivity and in welcoming the hostages home in the  very near future. Let's show the world that we, the American people, want to  leave the past behind us, look positively to the future and, once and for all,  close the file on the hostage issue."  </P> <P> Seventeen Western hostages, seven of them Americans, are still held in the  Middle East.  </P></p>

			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / Watchdog attacks credit insurance Credit insurance sold with loans and credit cards is 'costly and rife with exclusions', the Consumers Association says in a report published today in its Which? magazine. The insurance, also known as payment protection, covers repayments if the borrower becomes unemployed or cannot work through ill-health. Premiums have risen steeply because of the high rate of claims during the recession. On average, insurance now adds 65 per cent to the cost of credit, the association says. Details of exclusions are rarely provided at the point of sale. The Which? report cites the example of a policy sold to an unemployed man. He later found a job, but subsequently lost it. His claim was rejected because the policy excluded claims if the borrower was unemployed at the start of the agreement - this had not been pointed out to him. Credit insurance providers have frequently used inertia selling methods, where insurance is automatically included with a loan or credit card unless the borrower specifically ticks a box to decline it, or crosses out a clause in the small print. The Office of Fair Trading asked lenders to end inertia selling by the beginning of this year, but so far not all have complied. The OFT is now threatening to review the consumer credit licence of any lender found still to be using inertia selling after the end of this month.</p>

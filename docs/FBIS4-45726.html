			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Robert Tyerman: "Pollution Threatens Insurers"] </F>   [Text] Surfers Against Sewage may seem a less awesome lobby  group than Friends of the Earth or Greenpeace. But a &pound;5,000  damages claim launched by SAS [Surfers Against Sewage] against  Southern Water is expected to provide a test case which could  decide whether British companies must expect to face pollution  bills running into many billions of pounds.    Surfer James Andrews claims he caught Hepatitis A from the  sea 700 metres offshore from Eastbourne after contamination from  sewage emissions from Southern Water. The water company says  there are no recorded instances of the disease being contracted  from sea water and argues there is no evidence in the United  Kingdom to link Hepatitis A with bathing or surfing.    The importance of the case lies in its implications for the  liabilities that industrial companies and insurers face over  pollution dating back many years. Southern Water believes that  at least 60 other potential cases hang on the result of the SAS  claim.    Pollution has become a nightmare for many companies in  chemical, oil and extractive industries and a big threat to the  worldwide insurance industry.    After lobbying by Stephen Merrett, Lloyd's of London's  former  deputy chairman, a Bill is before the United States Congress  designed to alleviate the crisis, but potential liabilities are  still huge.    Water contamination is the latest in a flood of pollution  claims that are scaring companies and politicians on both sides  of the Atlantic. United States insurance ratings agency A M Best  says potential U.S. environmental and asbestosis claims--many  insured or reinsured by British companies or Lloyd's  syndicates--could top &pound;1,300 billion.    Best says that already identifiable claims could top  &pound;88  billion over the next 25 years. That is nearly three-quarters of  the insurance industry's capital.    The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has identified  36,000 hazardous waste sites in need of a clean-up, at an  average cost of &pound;20 million per site. The Confederation of  British Industry has put the cost of cleaning up contaminated  British sites at &pound;20 billion.    The American situation is bedevilled by the legal concept of  "no-fault" liability: the principle that the polluter--or the  polluter's insurer--must pay, whether or not the pollution could  have been foreseen.    Recent British court judgments, notably in a case between  Cambridge Water and Eastern Counties Leather, have upheld the  principle of forseeability, but that is scant comfort to  insurers providing cover worldwide.    The latest twist is a spate of lawsuits against garages with  leaking underground storage tanks which have contaminated water  supplies.    "One site in three in Britain has some degree of  contamination," says Dave Stewart, a Shell spokesman.    BP [British Petroleum] says it will cost "several billions"  to put things right. The oil majors are now fitting polyethylene  and fibreglass pipes, instead of metal ones, and using  continuous tubing to reduce leaks.    But most garages are run by independent operators so the  process of upgrading and installing adequate leakage checks will  take time. There have been only a few insurance settlements for  leaks but the claims momentum is picking up.    Sun Alliance says another uncertainty in Europe is a  European  Commission pollution directive expected this year. Pessimists  fear companies could be made liable for long-term seepage and  other contamination which arguably could not have been foreseen.    Insurers have taken fright. They may be saddled with  historic  claims under old, liberally-worded policies written years before  pollution became a political issue, but they are writing more  restrictive policies now.    Lloyd's underwriter Richard Keeling says industrial  companies  have often been less than frank with insurers about known, but  not admitted, pollution.    He says: "When the EPA [Environmental Protection Agency]  visited one polluter whose works were next to a lake, they asked  a local why there was a boat out on it. `Every time you come',  he replied, `they have to send it out to collect the dead  ducks'."    Sun Alliance says: "From now on, we will insure the future,  but not the past." Insurers will no longer offer retrospective  liability cover and they are taking a tougher line with clients  suspected of ignoring obligations under today's environmental  laws.    "We will write sudden and accidental pollution risks but not  long-term seepage," says one group. "Insurers are devising  new--and costlier--products for clients to cope with today's  problems, but gradual contamination is virtually uninsurable at  present."    Amid the gloom, there are signs that Stephen Merrett's call  for changes in the U.S. market is being heard. A Bill backed by  the Administration aims to impose a 0.2 per cent levy on  casualty premiums to finance a "Superfund" to meet environmental  claims.    Polluting companies would take their insurance policies to  the fund and it would make a non-negotiable offer. If the  polluter does not like it, he would have to bear the entire cost  himself.    Hank Greenberg, chairman of U.S. insurer AIG [expansion not  given], has been demanding a levy for years. But he is  understood to feel that the present Bill does not cast its net  wide enough.    "Morally, we should not be paying for much of this," says  Keeling, who feels the Bill is a sign of an overdue sea change.  "Polluters, insurers, Greens and politicians have at last  decided that the present situation only benefits the lawyers."  He hopes that this time it will not be the lawyers who have the  last laugh.</p>

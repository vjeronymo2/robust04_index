			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Farm reform It is easy to lose count of the number of times EC farm ministers have definitively tamed the Common Agricultural Policy. As recently as the spring of 1988, Brussels was celebrating an historic accord to apply self-correcting price cuts and production limits once cereal and livestock surpluses showed signs of spinning out of control. Within 18 months it was obvious that this system was yet another in a long line of inadequate responses. To be fair the 29 per cent cereal price cut which forms the centrepiece of yesterday's deal is deeper than anything hitherto contemplated, while the principle of paying direct income support for farmers is a genuine breakthrough. That said, there is still a danger that the politicians will be grappling with some of the same issues four or five years down the line. The explanation lies in doubts about whether the latest medicine is really harsh enough, and whether farmers will gratefully cash their compensation cheques and seek to increase output on land which is not taken out of production. The headline 'set aside' target of 15 per cent will be more like 10 per cent in practice, and could be equivalent to 6-7 per cent on the assumption that farmers choose to give up their lowest yielding land. With productivity worth 2 per cent a year EC cereals output could be back to current levels in four years' time. If food processors are to maintain their profitability they will have to respond to lower input costs with higher trading margins. Much will depend on the competitive balance between manufacturers and retailers. Branded products should be at an advantage, but in fragmented sectors like poultry the likes of Sainsbury and the consumer will be in a position to take more of the spoils.</p>

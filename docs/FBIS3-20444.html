			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Installments No 75-78 of the serialized memoirs of Xu </F> Jiatun: "Xu Jiatun's Hong Kong Memoirs"]  <H5>  [18 Jul 93 p 2] </H5>   [Text] Seeking Foreign Capital, Rallying Support  From Overseas Chinese Capital    Overseas Chinese merchants intend a subterranian electric  pathway; no reaction from the Hong Kong government.    The majority of Overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia are from  Fujian Province, and we designated the deputy director of our  agency, Cao Weilian [2580 1218 1670], to particularly work on  having Fujian Province render assistance to the Overseas  Chinese. Guo Henian [6753 7729 1628] was a rubber plantation  owner in Malaysia, but had gained fame and fortune mainly in the  sugar business. He was renowned as the "King of Sugar" and had  excellent connections to the Huarun Company. We worked on him  through the intermediary of the Huarun concern, and Guo  gradually transferred the base of his business operations to  Hong Kong. He achieved considerable success in Hong Kong, and  from there, furthermore, penetrated China and invested in China  proper.    Huang Tingfang [7806 1694 2455] was in the real estate  business in Singapore. At one time in the past, he had served as  general manager of the Singapore Branch of the Bank of China; he  is well acquainted with Xue Wenlin [5641 2429 2651], who is the  present deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs  Office of the Bank of China. In the early 1980's, when the high  tide of real estate business in Singapore had passed, Huang  extended his business interests to Hong Kong. That was precisely  the time when real estate business in Hong Kong was at a low  ebb. At that time Huang bought up much land in Hong Kong, using  his good connections to Xue Wenlin. We, on the other hand, were  at that time just preoccupied with measures to restore  confidence among the residents of Hong Kong, and our attitude  toward Huang's daring and large-scale purchases of land was  therefore very supportive. The Bank of China was actively  loaning him funds for these purchases. With this support, Huang  went all out in land purchases, acquiring almost as much land as  Guo Desheng [6753 1795 0524], the giant in the real estate  business. Soon thereafter land prices recovered, and Huang was  able to earn huge profits. What he had not accomplished in  Singapore, he accomplished in Hong Kong, namely to score a  tremendous success. Huang Tingfang, having seized the right  opportunity, had acquired a fortune by buying up cheap land and  had risen to the ranks of prominent real estate merchants, just  after Li Jiacheng [2621 0857 6134] and Guo Desheng.    Huang Tingfang was also among the first large real estate  merchants who went into China and invested in real estate in  China proper. Prior to the 4 June incident, he had invested in  real estate in Fujian Province and in its city of Xiamen. He had  signed a contract with the Xiamen City government, undertaking  to upgrade Xiamen's busiest street, and he also engaged in real  estate developments in his native place, Changle county in  Fujian Province. When others stopped doing business in China  after the 4 June incident, Huang continued. Huang Tingfang had  confidence in Hong Kong, that was the most important element  contributing to his success. In 1983, he publicly expressed  approval of China recovering Hong Kong and also expressed full  confidence in Hong Kong's future. This made him a unique figure  at that time.    We had been actively supportive of the desires and plans of  Overseas Chinese to expand their business operations to Hong  Kong. Mao Junnian [3029 6874 1628] had a classmate by the name  of Ke [2688], who was also a native of Fujian Province, and who,  after graduating from Hong Kong University, had gone to the  United States and had been doing well there, prospering in his  industrial undertakings. Mao Junnian introduced him and brought  him to see me. He put forward a novel plan, namely to build a  subterranean electric walkway below Kowloon's busiest tourist  center from Tsim Sha Tsui and all along under Nathan Road, as an  additional attraction for tourism. The subterranean electric  walkway would entail construction of a subterranean metal  roadway with a conveyor belt, on which the people would stand.  Instead of walking, they would be moved along on the conveyor  belt. Space on both sides of the walkway could be developed for  shops and the service industry, and markets or buildings with  other purposes could be built at both entrances to the walkway.  He was prepared to invest in the scheme and hoped for  cooperation from Chinese capital.    This novel idea of his has had my full support, and I  promised to cooperate with him, but the crucial prerequisite  would be to get the consent and approval of the British  Government of Hong Kong. I asked him to pursue the matter in the  normal social order, first to consider the feasibility, prepare  a feasibility report, and then to apply to the Hong Kong  government. After he quickly finished this preparatory work, I  asked Zheng Hua [6774 5478], deputy director of NEW CHINA NEWS  AGENCY, to contact the relevant department of the Hong Kong  government, to tell them of our interest in the matter, and to  discuss the matter with them over a dinner, pointing out to them  that it would be beneficial for developments in Hong Kong and  hoping that the Hong Kong government would give the matter its  attention. However, throughout 1985 and 1986, and all the time  up to my departure from Hong Kong, the Hong Kong government was  never heard of again in this matter. This is really regrettable.    (4) Course of Growth in Strength of China's Capital  Involvement (1st of 5 pts).    Provinces and municipalities appeared in Hong Kong to set up  representations; reform had to adopt the principle of opening to  the outside world.    China's investment of capital funds in Hong Kong has  occurred  in stages. During the initial stage, its purpose was the covert  protection of underground work and to start up all kinds of  commercial enterprises to provide funds for the expenses of  underground activities. Later and gradually, it was providing  funds to develop some organizations to further its import-export  trade.    After the withdrawal of the Kuomintang from the mainland,  some of the organizations left behind by them were taken over;  for instance, the China Merchants Company, and were made to  serve further developments.    Following initiation of the reform and opening-up policy,  departments and commissions in charge of industrial production  and trade of the central authorities and of the various  provinces and municipalities of China proper had become very  eager to establish their own organizations in Hong Kong.  However, the guiding ideology of the Central Committee tended to  favor restrictions in this matter. Some members of the Central  Committee suggested to let the various provinces,  municipalities, ministries, and commissions establish  appropriate bases in Hong Kong. Others again were against  allowing more such components to be established as there were  already, in their opinion, quite a sufficient number there, and  that it instead should be a time for reorganization and  retrenchment. In 1983, on the initiative of the Hong Kong and  Macau Affairs Office and the Ministry of Foreign Economic  Relations and Trade [MOFERT], the State Council issued a  document that restricted the establishment of new organizations  in Hong Kong by the various provinces, municipalities,  ministries, and commissions and ordered the reorganization of  those formerly set up there. Prior to my assuming my duties in  Hong Kong, Li Hou [2621 0683] showed me the said document and  asked me to enforce its provisions after my arrival in Hong Kong.    I have been originally working at the local level, and I  thought from the standpoint of relevant departments and  commissions of provinces and municipalities, it would have been  quite necessary to establish bases in Hong Kong, since the  policy was to be one of reform and opening up. For instance, the  province of Jiangsu maintained a small outfit in Hong Kong,  attached to the Huarun Company, consisting of only two or three  persons. They were unable to do much, while; on the other hand,  the local people at home base urgently required information to  better understand the situation outside their home province,  required expanding contacts with foreign and Hong Kong business  firms to increase their import-export opportunities, as well as  learning about appropriately responding to conditions and  experiences in outside market activities. I disagreed with the  spirit of this document and tended to favor expanding the  organization of China's capital. At that time, Liao Chengzhi  [1675 2110 1807] was still alive, and I proposed to him and Li  Hou that enforcement of these provisions be delayed until my  transfer to Hong Kong, when I would have gained a better  understanding of the situation there. They both agreed.    After I had been in Hong Kong for some time, I again  proposed  to them to ask Beijing to send someone to Hong Kong, so that we  could jointly review the situation. The State Council agreed and  sent a vice minister of MOFERT to Hong Kong to investigate.  After two to three months of investigation, a new report was  submitted, which was quite different from previous reports. It  reflected a very externally oriented attitude and suggested that  the State Council permit provinces, municipalities, ministries,  and commissions to establish, within conditions, additional  organizations in Hong Kong. In response to my urging, the deputy  minister soon revisited Hong Kong, leading a delegation of  representatives from most of China's provinces and  municipalities to open a trade fair of unprecedented scale.  Several hundred people from China proper attended the fair,  which had a considerable impact on Hong Kong.    In the past, China unifiedly transacted all its foreign  trade  through the government's foreign trade agencies. The production  departments were essentially ignorant of foreign market  conditions. The government's foreign trade agencies transmitted  the trade plan, did the ordering of purchases, and all  marketing. Establishment by the various provinces,  municipalities, and other localities of their own organizations  in Hong Kong practically destroyed the former centralized  system, as these agencies would inform themselves of market  conditions, do research and decide on production plans, thus  effectively initiate a reform of China's entire foreign trade  system. End of Installment No. 75)  <H5>  [19 Jul 93 p 2] </H5>   [Text] Course of Growth in Strength of China's  Capital Involvement    Chen Yun [7115 0061]] instructed: "Don't let others pocket  all profits." Various obstacles building up against an expanding  role of China's capital involvement in Hong Kong.    Considering the way developments were taking place in Hong  Kong, the interests in Hong Kong in British capital, foreign  capital, the local Chinese capital, Overseas Chinese capital,  and Taiwanese capital deserved to be protected and offered  opportunities for continued growth. However, China's capital  should also have had a certain share. China's capital could,  and also had to strive for a certain measure of participation in  the developments, without claiming any prerogative, but merely  by studying and applying Hong Kong market experiences, and on  the premise of not "stealing the rice bowls" from the people of  Hong Kong, while also not adversely affecting their interests.  If by chance an element of instability should appear in Hong  Kong some time in the future, reliance on this foundation, the  use of capital from China, could mitigate the potential negative  effects on Hong Kong.    In my opinion there should be continuous growth in the  strength of China's capital. Why can't we have in Hong Kong a  Chinese "Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corporation," a Chinese  "Jardines," and a Chinese "Buterfield &amp; Swire"? We must not  replace them or drive them out, claiming certain prerogatives,  but must act in the mutual interests of both, co-existd, and on  this premise, do our utmost to develop our own affairs. Is that  not possible?    However, some among my Hong Kong comrades did not agree with  me, and some leading cadres in Beijing were also against me.  When I submitted my first report to the Central Committee on  work done in Hong Kong, in September of 1983, as mentioned  earlier, Li Xiannian [2621 0341 1819] felt that China-financed  organizations in Hong Kong must not expand their activities. He  furthermore expressed disapproval of any stock transactions,  which he considered "speculation and profiteering." He was  against investing in Hong Kong real estate, and wanted the Bank  of China to pay attention to and exercise control over all real  estate loans.    Following the mentioned report, the Hong Kong and Macau  Affairs Office called a conference at the end of 1983 to discuss  economic work in Hong Kong and Macau. Leading cadres of relevant  departments of the central authorities and leading cadres from  provincial and municipal departments in charge of foreign trade  participated at the conference. Leading cadres from  China-financed agencies in Hong Kong and Macau, who also  participated at the conference, and the Hong Kong and Macau  Affairs Office designated myself and Li Chuwen [2621 0328 2429]  to chair the conference.    There has never before been this kind of an all-China  conference to discuss in particular the economic work in Hong  Kong and Macau, and it was for the first time too that the Hong  Kong and Macau Affairs Office, representing the State Council,  chaired a conference of this nature. Two documents were produced  at the conference. One was a report by the Hong Kong and Macau  Affairs Office to the Central Committee. The report based on the  various speeches and directives by Chen Yun, Li Xiannian, and  other leading cadres of the Central Committee, and also on my  work report from Hong Kong, that time in September. This was  edited into several paragraphs of opinions of a policy  character, requesting in response instructions from the Central  Committee and suggesting to hold a nationwide conference for  their implementation. Several members of the Standing Committee  of the Central Committee, among them Deng Xiaoping, Chen Yun, Li  Xiannian, Hu Yaobang [5170 5069 6721], and Zhao Ziyang [6392  4793 7122] initialled the report, thereby signifying their  consent and approving the conference. The other document was a  draft resolution, which was submitted to the conference for  deliberation and amendment, which would then, in its final form,  also be submitted to the Central Committee and the State Council  for approval, to become an official resolution.    Almost 200 persons participated at the conference. As I  remember, no one delivered a speech at the start of the  conference, and there was then a discussion of the documents.  Most participants dissented from the contents of the documents.    The provisions of a policy nature in the documents were  condensed by the participants into what amounted to "ninefold  prohibitions." I remember more or less the following: they did  not allow anyone to proceed to Hong Kong and set up new foreign  trade organizations, they did not allow China-financed  investment activities, they did not allow China-financed  organizations to engage in "speculative" undertakings, they did  not allow to speculate in shares, in foreign exchange, in real  estate, and in gold. Foreign exchange held by China-financed  organizations must not be deposited with foreign banks, but must  be deposited with the Bank of China. They were against opening  markets for Hong Kong products in China and against marketing  such products inside China.    In sum, Chen Yun's directive, "don't have others pocket all  the profits," signified the main spirit of this policy, a policy  that erected all kinds of obstacles against the expansion of  China-capital financed undertakings in Hong Kong. Most of the  participants at the conference were highly dissatisfied, I too  was dissatisfied. Jiang Wengui [5592 2429 2710], director of the  Hong Kong and Macau Administrative Office of the Bank of China,  asked me: "Why does the Central Committee hold this kind of a  conference?" I replied: "I also don't know why." Throughout the  entire duration of the conference, I maintained complete  silence. (End of Installment No. 76)  <H5>  [20 Jul 93 p 2] </H5>   [Text] Course of Growth of Strength of China's  Capital Involvement (3rd of 5 pts)    Li Qiang [2621 1730] had once engaged in "speculation and  profiteering" and had reaped a profit of 600 billion for  Mainland China. Zhao Ziyang froze the "ninefold prohibitions"  directive and China's capital escaped a disaster.    I suggested that China's capital in Hong Kong should emulate  the Hong Kong merchants and use all the tricks of capitalism in  active business operations. I remember, when I had just arrived  in Hong Kong, the minister of the MOFERT, Li Qiang, stopped over  in Hong Kong on his trip abroad and inspected the Huarun  Company, which was an organization directly under the MOFERT. We  two were fellow townsmen and old friends. He was almost 70 years  old and in good health. He liked to eat candied haws on sticks  and the shoulder of pork; and of the latter, if plainly fried,  he could eat three to four kilos at one sitting. It was really  frightening. Whenever we met in Jiangsu, he asked me to get him  shoulder of pork. This time in Hong Kong, he had not changed. I  found a cook from Jiangsu Province and satisfied Li's craving.  During the meal, we talk leisurely and came to talk about the  Hong Kong merchants and how they got rich by trading in shares  and gold and could lead a life of abundance. We could only do  business in the old ways, were not to "speculate and profiteer,"  so our country could not get rich. Then, Li Qiang mysteriously  said: "Who says we don't know how to do some "speculating and  profiteering, I myself have once done some `speculation and  profiteering'! Once I `speculated' in gold and earned for the  state a profit of 600 million. We looked at each other and  laughed hilariously.    As to the document that was presented to the conference for  general discussion, almost all the units present at the  conference raised objections, but the sponsors of the conference  would not take note of them. After the conference I went to see  Zhao Ziyang.    Zhao Ziyang received me at his Zhongnanhai home. His library  there was about 30 or 40 square meters, with several bookshelves  filled with old and modern books. I told Zhao that this  conference had been conducted badly, and he asked me, why? I  said: "In the matter of China's capital funds engaging in  economic and commercial activities in Hong Kong, the conference  would disallow this and forbid that. The conference did not  start out from active developments, but was negatively  defensive, not at all in accordance with the need to expand from  a centralized position to the outside, and not at all utilizing  the spirit of Hong Kong." Zhao said: "Why did you not raise  objections?" I said: "You members of the Standing Committee all  initialled the report which the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs  Office had submitted to the Central Committee, how could I  openly voice opposition at the conference? I can only report  this to you and state my objections." Zhao Ziyang pondered this  for a while and then asked me: "What are we then to do? Should  we hold another conference and again issue another document?"    I understood that he personally could not very well  immediately invalidate the conference we have had. However, I  was concerned that if things were not immediately remedied and  if the "ninefold prohibitions" were enforced, as a consequence  of the conference, much more and significant damage would be  done. I therefore said: "It will not do, I am afraid, to handle  the situation in this way. I suggest that the documents from  this conference not be issued to lower levels, and that when we  go back we also do not relay them to anyone else."    Zhao Ziyang did not clarify his position at that time. I  thought he tacitly agreed, but did not feel he should  immediately declare his consent. After all, he still wanted to  go on working as a member of the Standing Committee.    After I returned to Hong Kong, I notified those leading  cadres in organizations working with China-provided capital  funds who had attended the conference: For the time being, don't  relay anything of the spirit of the conference, but await the  receipt of the documents before you implement anything. Later,  sure enough, the documents were never transmitted, and the  "spirit" of the conference was never disseminated. China's  capital in Hong Kong thus escaped a disaster.    In addition to giving my full support to the establishment  of  Hong Kong organs by the various provinces, municipalities,  ministries, and commission, I also suggested that their leading  cadres more frequently visit Hong Kong, broaden their horizon,  and learn from market experiences. At that time, I had only a  superficial knowledge of market economy, I only knew some  aspects of it in the buyer's market and the seller's market. In  China proper it was essentially a seller's market with  production regulated by plan, but in a buyer's market production  is determined according to consumption needs and marketing  conditions.    When I passed through Hong Kong on my visit to Australia in  1979, some Hong Kong capitalists informed me of the ways of  trade, how to adapt to the needs of the market and how to  participate in the competition according to the law of the  survival of the fittest. They said, enterprises are not only a  matter of production and management, the main thing is effective  business operations. If products are produced in excess and  cannot all be sold and have to be stockpiled, the enterprise  will sooner or later collapse.    On my return, I emphasized in my report to Hua Guofeng [5478  0948 6912], who was at that time leading cadre in the Central  Committee, that it simply would not do that China's factories  concern themselves only about management and not about effective  business operations. Hua Guofeng agreed with my opinion and in  one of his speeches he brought up the problem of more effective  business operations of enterprises. (End of Installment No. 77)  <H5>  [21 Jul 93 p 2] </H5>   [text] Course of Growth of Strength of China-Provided  Capital Funds    Economic reform led to the "Shekou [Shek O] Incident," Yuan  Geng [5913 1649 was personally accused. Diversification in the  business of the Huarun Company; reforms and improvements also  carried out in the Bank of China.    After I started to work in Hong Kong, I felt even more  strongly that leading cadres inside China should come to Hong  Kong and look around how Hong Kong people conduct trade. I did  my very best to suggest that the checking procedure should be  more liberal, allowing more people to visit Hong Kong. As  mentioned earlier, in the past the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs  Office had exercised strict controls, and I had repeatedly  requested that they should relax these controls, but they never  took notice. Up to 1986, the Central Committee had delegated the  right of approving business trips to Hong Kong to the Hong Kong  and Macau Commission. Nominally, the State Council had entrusted  the Hong Kong and Macau Commission to give approvals on the  State Council's behalf, thereby resolving the problem. I again  and again urged the executives of the NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY to  have the checking procedure relaxed, allowing more people from  inside China to visit Hong Kong and study things there.  Developments were fastest in the provinces of Guangdong and  Fujian, especially in Guangdong because of its more favorable  location. The China-financed organizations also experienced very  rapid development at this stage.    Reform and opening up to the outside world, as it was taking  place within China, also posed problems for some of the Chinese  capital-financed organizations which had been well-established  "old Hongs" in Hong Kong, as to how to adapt to the new  situation. The new task they were now facing was how to improve  and reform their business operations to conform to the new  requirements of China proper. One who has done outstanding work  in this respect was Yuan Geng of the China Merchants Company.    Yuan Geng built up a new district at Shenzhen-Shekou.  Although the area is part of Shenzhen, the way it was developed  right from the start was quite different from Shenzhen. In  Shenzhen emphasis was placed on tourism, the service industries,  and real estate, while Shekou placed emphasis on small industry.  Its subsequent development about matched that of Shenzhen.    In administrative respects, Shekou is a ward of Shenzhen  City, but it is independent; its cadres are allocated by the  China Merchants Company itself. Yuan Geng knows how to choose  the right person for the right job, and he also employed new  management tactics. He regularly employed some scholars and  experts from inside China to explore and work out economic  reform problems. The well-known "Shekou incident," which  occurred later, was indeed due to the fact that a "Youth  Education Experts and Shekou Youths Symposium" was held in  Shekou. Some new problems were brought up which offended some  of the oldsters in Beijing. At a meeting of the Central  Committee Standing Committee, someone pointed to Yuan Geng  personally as being an instigator of bourgeois liberalism.  Although the Central Committee never officially notified me,  someone told me that Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang actually  protected Yuan Geng at the Standing Committee meeting and  prevented the affair to have further consequences. I have a  friendly hello for Yuan Geng: the reform has to be pursued, but  with some care, so that others will not give you trouble.    Shekou developed very fast, and the China Merchants Company  itself developed rapidly. Yuan Geng adopted the business methods  of the capitalist world. Tonnage of China Merchants' ocean  transport fleet rapidly increased, and their other business  undertakings also flourished. The Ministry of Communications was  very satisfied, and Ye Fei [0673 7378], who was then minister of  the said ministry, came to hold esteem for Yuan Geng even more  highly because of his successes.    Under the pressure of circumstances, the Huarun Company also  began to diversify its business activities. Formerly, it was the  main foreign trade organization in Hong Kong of the MOFERT, in  fact Huarun monopolized China's foreign trade in Hong Kong.  Currently, the various provinces and municipalities are  themselves taking up business operations, and Huarun's  monopolistic position is gradually being undermined, so that  Huarun is compelled to diversify and to somehow enhance its  business operations. Zhang Jianhua [1728 1696 5478], Huarun's  chairman of the board, is very reform-minded, and has also had  much success. They expanded their operations not only in Hong  Kong, but also toward the United States and Europe, where they  set up branch organizations. The China-financed group has  already become a large and influential enterprise in Hong Kong.    Even the Bank of China group, traditionally very  conservative, has instituted some reforms and improvements. When  I first came to Hong Kong, I heard many reports about the  excessively cautious way in which the Bank of China granted  loans, and that they were not eager to get involved in large  projects. On the other hand, Zhuang Shiping [8369 0013 1627],  chairman of the board at the Nanyang Commercial Bank, had an  excellent reputation and was believed to be a very active  businessman. I sought confirmation from Jiang Wengui [5592 2429  2710] and Huang Tingyen [7806 1694 1484] of the Bank of China,  but they both disagreed with the opinion of the general public.  They acknowledged that Zhuang Shiping was a man of great  courage, but that he also had a lot of loans that went bad. I  contended that they give more thought to the impressions held by  those outsiders.    The fact that the leading cadres of the Bank of China are  thoroughly versed in the banking business, are continuously  expanding the scope of their business, and reforming and  improving their procedures, has a powerful influence on Hong  Kong's financial affairs and economic development, is supportive  of the reform in China proper, and is also particularly  influential in efforts to rally Chinese capital in Hong Kong for  united action.

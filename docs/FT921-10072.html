			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / New rules on package holidays proposed THE GOVERNMENT yesterday announced draft regulations for package holidays, but postponed a decision on how to protect consumers when travel companies collapse. The regulations, which were announced by Mr Edward Leigh, consumer affairs minister, were immediately attacked by the Association of British Travel Agents (Abta) for failing to protect consumers adequately against unjustified surcharges and negligence by tour operators. The draft rules set out information to be included in travel brochures and the circumstances in which surcharges can be imposed. They follow a 1990 European Community directive which requires regulations to protect package tourists to be brought in by the end of the year. Ministers want to consult further on how best to deal with the most contentious provision of the directive. This says that tour organisers and travel agents should provide security to ensure that tourists can be repatriated and receive refunds if their holiday company collapses. The government has said it will require all companies offering package holidays to be licensed, but it has not decided who should be responsible for issuing licences or how many licensing authorities there should be. It said it hoped to produce proposals on licensing within the next few weeks. One option would be to allow the Civil Aviation Authority, which licenses charter-flight tour operators, to regulate all package tour companies. Some travel companies believe the government might also be considering allowing the industry to establish its own regulatory bodies. Earlier proposals presented in July were criticised for suggesting restrictions on surcharges that were less onerous than those in Abta's code of practice. The government had suggested that tour operators should not be able to impose surcharges within 20 days of departure, compared with 30 days under the Abta code. Mr Leigh said the new regulations on surcharges were in line with those in the Abta code. Mr John Dunscombe, Abta's president, said that the surcharges would be inadequate without an effective monitoring scheme. He added that the regulations also provided consumers with inadequate protection against acts of negligence by tour operators. Mr Dunscombe said: 'I am particularly disappointed that our argument for liability insurance has not been accepted by the government, and we shall continue to push for its acceptance.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Because of international legal concerns, the  government of the Republic, through the Ministries of Foreign  Relations and Government, may create in our country refugee  camps for Mexican refugees. These refugees would remain in the  camps while the presidents of Mexico and Guatemala determine the  best path to follow, according to Defense Minister Mario Rene  Enriquez Morales.    The minister recalled that for 12 years, Mexico has given  shelter to many Guatemalan refugees. He also noted that some of  these are "guerrillas" who have crossed into Mexican territory  and have been received as refugees. As evidence of this, he  continued, URNG [Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity] rebels  are living in Mexico and have established organs of influence,  such as the news agencies CERIGUA and ENFOPRENSA.    Nevertheless, the military leader said: "I hope the  situation the Mexican brothers are going through changes when  the rebels understand the damage they are inflicting upon the  population. In turn, they will have to take measures aimed at  dialogue and reconciliation to spare residents more death and  suffering."  <H5>  Defense Minister Confirms URNG Support </H5>   Defense Minister Enriquez Morales stated yesterday that  reports about the military logistical participation of the URNG  within the Zapatista National liberation Army (EZLN) have been  confirmed, as stated by Mexican authorities.    Mexico's Attorney General's Office told the media covering  the events that URNG combatants are participating in the attacks  on the town of San Cristobal de las Casas, because one of them  was captured. The defense minister said that this confirms our  feeling.    There is no official information on URNG involvement;  however, the possibility that the URNG may be furnishing weapons  and supplies to destabilize Mexico, as they cannot do in their  own country, has not been ruled out, Enriquez concluded.</p>

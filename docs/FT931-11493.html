			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Armitage shakes off sales decline Continuing tight control on costs and cash flow enabled Armitage Bros, the pet foods group, to hold pre-tax profits in the 28 weeks to December 13. On sales reduced from Pounds 13.1m to Pounds 12.9m, profit came to Pounds 715,000, compared with Pounds 712,000. Net interest charges were cut to Pounds 69,000 (Pounds 122,000). Mr Russell Taylor, chief executive, explained that consumers spent less and traded down on pet accessories and Christmas goods. Exports generally, and home sales of Wafcol dog food in particular, performed well. The UK market remained sluggish but there was the opportunity to build on export performance through the devaluation of sterling. Last year's tax charge benefited from a substantial credit, so this time earnings per share were down from 13.4p to 11.9p. The interim dividend is again 2.6p.</p>

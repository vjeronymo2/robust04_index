			<p>BFN     [Text] Commenting on an Albanian Foreign Ministry statement  that criticizes the Greek Government for Greek minority members'  involvement in the Greek Secret Police and other  unconstitutional activities as well as illegal possession of  arms, Government Spokesman Evangelos Venizelos said Greece is  not willing to accept slanderous and unfounded allegations.  Greece wants to improve Greek-Albanian relations, but that  improvement depends on respect for the human rights of the Greek  minority in Albania.    Venizelos stressed that if there is any evidence, it should  have been presented either at the Zurich meeting between Foreign  Ministers Karolos Papoulias and Alfred Serreqi or at the meeting  of the Ministries of Public Order delegations in Ioannina.    The government appeared satisfied with the explanations made  by the U.S. State Department, following the demarche lodge by  Greek Ambassador in Washington Loukas Tsilas, regarding a  statement by U.S. State Department Spokesman Michael McCurry.  According to McCurry's statement, the U.S. Government has no  credible evidence that it is the policy of the Albanian  Government to suppress the Greek minority. The government  spokesman said the Greek Government asked the State Department  to make the explanation given to the Greek ambassador in the  form of a public statement.</p>

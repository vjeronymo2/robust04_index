			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by I.Zh. Bunin, T.V. Korzh, T.F. Terentyev,Ye.G. </F> Kurzina, and S.M. Kalinina, Moscow; UDC 669.15:539.43]    [Abstract] An experimental study of maraging alloy steels  was made concerning their fatigue strength and the mechanism of  crack propagation in them under cyclic loads. The  industrial-grade EP 678 steel (0.022% C, 10 9.30%  Ni, 1.95%  Mo, 0.84% Ti, 0.09% Cu, 0.088% Al,  0.06% Zn, 0.02% Mn,  0.01% Nb, 0.14% Si, 0.008% P, 0.007%  S, 0.002 B) had been  selected as a representative of this group. Ingots of this steel  were heat treated as follows: quenching from 950-970C in  water for 30 min + aging at 520+/-10C for 3 h. For fatigue  tests and for microstructural examination they were cold-rolled  into 3 mm thick strips after quenching and into 2 mm thick  strips after aging. Some of the steel was quenched from  980C and then cold-rolled into rods 50 mm in diameter for  extra test. For determination of its standard mechanical  properties, some of the steel was cold-rolled into rods 5 mm in  diameter and specimens were cut out of them with the axis  oriented in the direction of rolling. Cracking resistance under  static loads was determined on 15 mm thick prismatic specimens  under eccentric tension. For a determination of cracking  resistance under impact loads acting perpendicularly to the  direction of rolling, 10 mm square and 55 mm long bar specimens  with a 1 mm deep notch were tested in a Charpy machine. Cyclic  testing at a 50 Hz frequency was done: 1) in an Instron-1603  machine on rods 50 mm in diameter under pure flexure, for  determination of the endurance limit;2) in an Instron-1253  machine on 2 mm and 3 mm thick 50x300 mm[.sup]2[/] large  plates, for exploration of the fatigue fracture micromechanisms  during steady crack growth and during accelerated crack growth.  All mechanical tests were performed at 20C temperature.  Microstructural examination was done under a Neophot-3 optical  microscope, under a JEM-200 electron emission microscope by the  method of replicas, and under a JSM-U3 scanning electron  microscope. Specimens for this examination were electropolished  with an electrolyte containing 1 g CrO[.sub]3[/] + 65 ml  H[.sub]3[/]PO[.sub]4[/] + 15 ml  H[.sub]2[/]SO[.sub]4[/] and etched with an  HNO[.sub]3[/]:HCl= 3:1 mixture. Particular attention was paid  to the zone of intense plastic deformation at the tip of a  growing fatigue crack, metallographic examination having  revealed here pores and discrete discontinuities along the grain  boundary. The results of this study, including diagrams of  fatigue fracture kinetics based on the test data, correlate with  the hypothesis of fractal geometry in nature (B.B. Mandelbrot,  1984) and the theory of self-organized criticality (P. Bak, K.  Chen; V MIRE NAUKI, No. 3, 1991.). The authors thank L.G. Orlov  for helping with microstructural examination.

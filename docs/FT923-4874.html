			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / World Trade News: Greece to buy 40 fighters from US GREECE is to buy 40 new F-16 fighter aircraft from the US in a government-to-government sale, with delivery expected to start in 1993, the Greek defence ministry said yesterday. The price is still to be finally negotiated but is likely to be about Dr160bn (Pounds 457.6m). The purchase will mark the final stage of a Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.25bn) Greek air force procurement programme dating from October 1984. Greece already has 40 F-16s, bought from General Dynamics, the manufacturer, under a deal that included a number of offset agreements. The Greek government believes that delays in implementing the offset accords, which included a Dollars 50m investment programme and manufacture of F-16 components in Greece, reduced their potential value for the economy. It also wants to avoid prolonged bargaining this time in case production of F-16s is phased out earlier than expected. Otherwise, Greece could find itself in the awkward position of receiving the aircraft from Turkey, its Nato ally but rival for control of the Aegean Sea. Turkey has a joint venture agreement with General Dynamics to make the F-16. Meanwhile, a dispute with Dassault of France, supplying the Greek air force with 40 Mirage 2000 combat jets, was resolved last week. The contract was amended to cover upgrading of the air-to-air radar on 28 aircraft already delivered. After Greek pilots flying the Mirage 2000 complained of radar failures in rainy weather, the government refused to take delivery of the remaining 12 aircraft under the existing contract. Under the revised agreement, Dassault is also to provide, free of charge, a Falcon 900 military transport fitted out as a passenger aircraft. It will be used by Greek government officials.</p>

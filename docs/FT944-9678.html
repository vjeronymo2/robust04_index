			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Japan under pressure on two fronts - Talks with the US and the EU Politely disguised anguish may be present beneath the smiles of Japan's senior politicians as they welcome their latest batch of guests to trade talks in Tokyo this week. Delegations from Japan's two biggest trade partners, the US and the European Union, will arrive in Tokyo to obtain fresh promises that Japan realise its much vaunted plans to reduce the more than 10,000 regulations which protect and constrain an estimated 40 per cent of industrial activity. Trade tactics employed by Washington and Brussels over Japan have converged in substance as well as in timing. The US will take a more co-operative line with Japan, because it is tired of being accused of bullying, while the European Commission will take a tougher line because it is tired of being accused of failing to get results. Washington has turned away, at least for the moment, from its former strategy of pushing for import targets and promises to be less confrontational, though no less demanding. Brussels will, for the first time in several years, demand tangible progress. The message is that there is a limit to the EU's patient trade diplomacy with Japan, until now limited to polite statistical studies of foreign shares in each others' markets. The commission has a second objective. Sir Leon Brittan, Commissioner responsible for external economic affairs, wants to return home with a promise that European companies will not be cut out of Japanese trade deals with the US. Some member states are uneasy that well mannered Europe wins none of the big trade prizes achieved by US table-thumping. Motorola's access to the mobile telephone market, won early this year, and US dominance of Japanese defence procurement are pointed to as examples. Pressure is building up from European suppliers, such as France's Dassault Aviation, which wants the airforce to buy its Mystere Falcon business jet for transporting officers. Another is Britain's GEC-Marconi, hoping that Japan's defence agency will be allowed the political freedom to carry out its wish to buy UK instead of US minesweeping sonar. The US delegation today begins two days of talks, in which it will present Japan with a list of deregulation steps across 10 industries. Sir Leon and two Commissioner colleagues meet ministers on Saturday with a similar shopping list covering eight sectors. Examples of long standing demands, shared by the US and EU, include: An end to the mass of planning and operating restrictions that impede the growth of supermarkets, a move which would spell death for the 1.5m small, family-run businesses that dominate Japanese high streets, but high profits for the budding discount sector. Lay open the maze of restrictions that ensure that foreign investment managers handle a mere 0.2 per cent of Japan's Y170,000bn (Pounds 1,075bn) pension funds. Streamline the arcane car inspection system, which requires each new vehicle to be checked twice, by two different government agencies, before it reaches the road. This ensures most car makers can only make a profit if they sell high volumes. Review the statutes of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, the domestic telecommunications monopoly, to make it cheaper for private sector operators to plug international or long distance calls into NTT's local networks. Ensure that Japanese government policies for more open public procurement are carried out. The signs are that the Japanese government and the behind-the-scenes power of big business also impede foreign competition. Retailing is a good example because it touches everyday lives. Japan's large scale retail law, governing opening hours and planning consent, has been revised twice in the past two years to make life easier for new shops. Since the second revision last May, the number of supermarkets to open in Japan has quadrupled to about 80 a month as a result. Yet still less than 10 per cent of supermarket goods are foreign. Meanwhile, Reuter reports that Japanese officials yesterday said they were sticking to their guns in their dispute with the US over access to Tokyo's car and car parts market, despite an agreement to re-open stalled talks on the issue. 'It's fine to re-open the talks, but Japan has not given up its basic conditions (for re-opening),' Mr Hideaki Kumano, vice-minister for international trade and industry, said in Tokyo. He said Japan was waiting for the US to move to restart the talks, adding that Japan had outlined three conditions for doing so. Last Thursday Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, said he and Japanese trade minister Ryutaro Hashimoto had agreed to re-open vehicle sector talks, but set no date. The talks have been stalled since the two sides failed to reach agreement at the end of September. Yesterday Mr Kantor warned Japan that he intended to pry open its automotive market, even if that meant resorting to unilateral trade measures. 'We are going to make sure we make progress one way or another,' Mr Kantor, in Jakarta for broader Asian-Pacific trade talks, said. President Bill Clinton, also attending the Asian-Pacific trade talks in Indonesia, told prime minister Tomiichi Murayama yesterday that more progress on trade - especially cars and car parts - was needed, a US official said.</p>

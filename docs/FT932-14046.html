			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / World Trade News: EC and US will make last try to block ban SIR Leon Brittan today will make one final attempt to head off a US ban, scheduled to go into effect tomorrow, on EC companies bidding for US government procurement contracts. After two days of meetings in Washington, the EC Commissioner yesterday said he and Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, had failed to reach agreement. The latter insists the sanctions will be imposed tomorrow, unless the EC agrees to waive discriminatory provisions in its new utilities directive. The two trade officials, who were clearly weary, briefed journalists after meetings had run for four hours longer than expected. They said that, although Sir Leon was returning to Brussels late yesterday, they would speak by telephone once more - at noon today Washington time (4 pm GMT) - in a last effort to settle. Sir Leon is due today to report on the talks to a full meeting of the European Commission in Strasbourg. EC member states are divided over whether to retaliate against the US if Washington implements sanctions tomorrow. The UK, Germany and the Netherlands are concerned about a possible trade war with the US, while France is more inclined to take an aggressive stance if confronted by sanctions. A senior EC official said it was likely that France's hand would be strengthened if the US were to go ahead with sanctions. Despite their failure so far to reach agreement, Sir Leon and Mr Kantor seem to have achieved a comfortable informal relationship. They bantered with each other and the press, while laying out a schedule for a series of bilateral and quadrilateral meetings designed to achieve agreement on a comprehensive pact over tariff cuts, in time for the July summit of the Group of Seven industrial countries. The two said they had 'exchanged views' on various issues, including steel and Airbus, but they were vague about the details. Mr Kantor expressed satisfaction that the EC was 'nearing completion on all the steps it needs to take' towards an earlier agreement on oilseeds. Sir Leon insisted that substantial progress had been made on the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks. The two will meet again on May 7, when Mr Jacques Delors, EC Commission president, will be in Washington to meet President Bill Clinton. The Brittan-Kantor meetings will broaden, possibly to include Canadians and Japanese, at the end of May, and in Paris on June 1-2.</p>

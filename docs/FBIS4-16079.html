			<p>BFN     [Text] Stepanakert, April 13 (SNARK)--In connection with  latest bombardments of the Karabakh towns and villages the  Government of Nagorno-Karabakh made today an official statement.    The statement says that with the connivance of the world  community the Azerbaijani authorities go on with the war against  the civil population of Nagorno-Karabakh.    This morning, the statement mentions, the Azerbaijani war  planes again and again bombed the capital of Nagorno-Karabakh -  Stepanakert. As a result of bombardment there are victims, the  houses were ruined. The war planes also bombed the other  settlements of Nagorno-Karabakh. Victims also reported.    Azerbaijani military aircraft is going on with barbarous  bombardments. Meanwhile the Azerbaijani leader Geydar Aliyev  makes cynic appeals to the Armenian population of  Nagorno-Karabakh to stop the bloodshed assuring the security for  the Karabakh Armenians. Twice in a period of three days the  Azerbaijani war planes bombed the capital of Nagorno-Karabakh --  the Azerbaijani authorities showed the real truth of their  false statements.    The document the Karabakh Government issued states the  Karabakh authorities made the Karabakh troops undertake all the  measures to defend the civil population. Besides, the Karabakh  side reserves the right to retaliate.    The document says the Azerbaijani side is responsible for  the  escalation of the tension in the region.</p>

			<p><P> July 21, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AIRLINES;  </P> <P> INVESTOR GROUP SAYS IT MAY TRY TO BUY USAIR;  </P> <P> AIRLINE STRENGTHENED ITS 'POISON PILL' TAKEOVER DEFENSE LAST MONTH  </P> <P> A group led by Michael H. Steinhardt, an aggressive New York money manager,  said Thursday that it owns more than 5% of USAir Group and may try to acquire  the nation's fifth-largest airline.  </P> <P> USAir's shares rose $2.125 on news of the possible takeover attempt, closing at  $49.75 on the New York Stock Exchange. A USAir spokesman would not comment on  Steinhardt's action.  </P> <P> Steinhardt, 48, runs one of the most respected private investment firms on Wall  Street and manages a $1.3-billion portfolio. He is known for his quick trading,  often buying a stock in the morning and selling it for a profit hours later.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Never Moved Before  </P> <P> Steinhardt said in a statement filed with the Securities and Exchange  Commission that his group had raised its stake in USAir to 5.89% from 4.44%.  The group now holds 2.5 million shares worth about $129 million. The Steinhardt  group acquired its latest 546,900 shares at prices ranging from about $45.73 to  $47.60.  </P> <P> Steinhardt, through his Steinhardt Partners and its affiliates, has taken  positions in other airline companies before but has never moved to acquire one.  </P> <P> Takeover rumors have swirled around the airline industry since Los Angeles  investor Alfred A. Checchi's winning $4.05-billion bid last month for NWA Inc.,  the parent of Northwest Airlines. Checchi's $121-a-share tender offer expires  today.  </P> <P> As a defense against an unwanted suitor, USAir last month strengthened its  "poison pill" anti-takeover plan.  </P> <P> USAir itself has been active in the takeover game, buying both Piedmont  Airlines and Pacific Southwest Airlines in 1987. Its operational merger with  Piedmont becomes official on Aug. 5.  </P></p>

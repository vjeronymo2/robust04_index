			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / International Company News: HJ Heinz slips 15% in second term HJ Heinz, the US food products company, yesterday said its second-quarter earnings, excluding a one-time gain for divestments, slipped 15 per cent, mainly because of the negative impact of currency fluctuations. However, the weaker financial performance belies the underlying strength of Heinz's leading brand franchises, which showed volume growth, improved prices and better market shares in the three months to October 27. Sales were 4 per cent ahead at Dollars 1.8bn, against Dollars 1.73bn a year earlier. However, Heinz's large presence in Britain and Italy, which have witnessed sharp devaluations of their currencies over the past 15 months, worked against the Pittsburgh-based company. If exchange rates held steady, revenues would have shown an 11 per cent gain. Heinz does not give separate figures on its domestic and international sales and earnings. The company, which includes Heinz ketchup, Star Kist canned tuna and 9 Lives cat food in its brand stable, said net income was Dollars 193.1m, or 75 cents a share, against Dollars 154.1m, or 60 cents, in the 1992 quarter. If a Dollars 127m pre-tax gain from the sale of an Italian confectionery business and a US rice operation were excluded, however, earnings would work through at 51 cents. Increased marketing expense and a higher rate of taxation also had a negative impact on the bottom line. Advertising costs and other brand support rose 13 per cent on the year, while the provision for income taxes climbed 65 per cent to Dollars 115m. For the first six months, net income was Dollars 345m, or Dollars 1.34 a share, more than double last year's total of Dollars 164.3m, or 64 cents. Sales were 3 per cent higher at Dollars 3.39bn, against Dollars 3.3bn. Mr Terry Bivens, an analyst with Argus Research in New York, said the performance was disappointing. On Wall Street, the shares fell Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 36 3/8 in morning trading but recovered to close Dollars  1/8 higher at Dollars 37.</p>

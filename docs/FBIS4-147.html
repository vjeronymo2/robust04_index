			<p>BFN     [Text] The mediators at the peace talks in Lusaka, Zambia,  are expected to present a new document to bring the government  and the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola  [UNITA] closer together. Council of Ministers Secretary Carlos  Feijo is in the Zambian capital, as President Jose Eduardo dos  Santos' envoy, carrying new proposals from the Angolan  Government. In Lusaka, the president's envoy has already met  with mediator Alioune Blondin Beye and the government team.  Observers say the new proposals could signify government's  flexibility in the face of UNITA's demands. Nothing is known yet  however about the contents of this new government proposal. UN  Secretary General Butrus-Ghali will meet with his special  representative in Geneva on 7 April, and the meeting is expected  to center on the new document with which the mediators hope to  bring the government and UNITA closer together.</p>

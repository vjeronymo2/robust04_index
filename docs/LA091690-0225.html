			<p><P> September 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GALANTER CRITICISM CALLED 'CHEAP SHOT'  </P> <P> Letter-writer Steve Schlein recently complained (Times, Sept. 2) about the city  of Los Angeles' bungled handling of permit applications for a project in his  (and my) Venice beachfront neighborhood.  </P> <P> For the most part, he was right in his criticism of the way the city Planning  Department and Department of Transportation processed the application too  slowly, leading to the unconditional approval of a controversial proposal.  </P> <P> But he reveals his true motive for writing with his parting shot at  Councilwoman Ruth Galanter ("(She) has not shown any interest in finding out  exactly why this happened"). This is a flat-out dishonest remark, particularly  when considered in the context of your previous coverage of the story, which  notes her concern with the situation.  </P> <P> I also know he's wrong because I'm her staff person assigned to work on the  case in question.  </P> <P> Councilwoman Galanter has been very active in trying to get to the bottom of  this annoying and perplexing case. At her direction, I've been exploring why  and how it happened, how it can be prevented in the future, and how best to  handle this case as it goes on.  </P> <P> Representatives of our office have spoken with the city attorney, several top  executives in the Planning Department, no less than four zoning administrators  and several other Planning Department staffers, a lawyer from the state  attorney general's office, Coastal Commission staff members, numerous community  residents, and the developer's attorney, who precipitated the crisis by  invoking the state law in the first place.  </P> <P> Councilwoman Galanter has formally requested a response to a number of crucial  issues the case raises. She is obviously interested in doing a lot more than  just finding out why it happened, contrary to Schlein's disinformative cheap  shot.  </P> <P> JIM BICKHART  </P> <P> Legislative Deputy  </P> <P> 6th Council District  </P></p>

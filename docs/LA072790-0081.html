			<p><P> July 27, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MAN PLEADS GUILTY IN $12-MILLION FRAUD CASE;  </P> <P> SCHEMES: PROSECUTORS SAY MOST OF THE MONEY GATHERED BY ALAN KERANEN WAS USED TO  PAY INTEREST TO EARLIER INVESTORS AND TO SUPPORT HIS LAVISH LIFESTYLE.  </P> <P> A former high school football coach who operated a Ponzi scheme that bilked  nearly $12 million from more than 200 unsuspecting investors pleaded guilty  Thursday to two counts of mail fraud and two counts of submitting false tax  returns to banks.  </P> <P> Alan Keranen, 42, formerly of Woodland Hills, admitted to U.S. District Judge  William Matthew Byrne Jr. that he siphoned off money from the Woodland  Hills-based California Anchor Group for his personal use, U.S. Dist. Atty.  Anita Dymant said.  </P> <P> California Anchor, founded by Keranen in 1983, was intended to be a real estate  investment company developing and selling apartment buildings in the San  Fernando Valley.  </P> <P> Lured by promises of a 25% return on their money, investors refinanced their  houses, cashed in their IRAs and spent their nest eggs to get in on the  venture, according to prosecutors and victims.  </P> <P> But Dymant said most of the money went toward paying interest to earlier  investors and to support Keranen's lavish lifestyle.  </P> <P> She said Keranen paid for his sprawling Woodland Hills house, a condominium at  a Utah ski resort and a residence for his mother with money that he took from  the company.  </P> <P> Only a small fraction of the investors' money was ever placed in real estate  ventures, Dymant said.  </P> <P> Keranen had no difficulties recruiting investors because of his success in the  Amway organization, a multilevel marketing company that sells cleaning products  and other goods.  </P> <P> With his positive attitude, Keranen was a popular speaker on the lecture  circuit, where he told of recovering from a devastating bus accident to build a  fortune, according to victims.  </P> <P> He also sold motivational tapes with such titles as "You Too Can Be a  Millionaire."  </P> <P> Other Amway distributors interpreted his success as a sign of business acumen  and were eager to get involved in his real estate development venture,  prosecutors said.  </P> <P> But the pyramid scheme collapsed in May, 1987, two months after Keranen was  asked to leave Amway for violating the company's rules against involving too  many other distributors in non-Amway business.  </P> <P> Once Keranen was forced to leave Amway, "word spread like wildfire," Dymant  said, and Keranen could not attract any new investors.  </P> <P> Keranen has since moved to Beaverton, Ore., and is running a water filtration  marketing firm called Double Win International.  </P> <P> Nine civil lawsuits -- with more than 100 plaintiffs -- have also been filed  against Keranen's estate, now in bankruptcy.  </P> <P> Sentencing has not been set for Keranen, who faces a maximum of 14 years in  state prison and up to $510,000 in fines.  </P></p>

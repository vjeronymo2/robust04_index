			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Reuters bought News and electronic information group Reuters Holdings was one of the strongest performers in the FT-SE 100 as a good reception for the trading figures combined with the impact of a strong dollar to send the shares spurting forward 6 per cent on the day. The market appreciated news that revenue for the third quarter rose 25 per cent to Pounds 590m against the same period last year. Following warnings from the company, the market had been expecting a slowdown in orders, which had not materialised because of a reporting time lag. As such the figures were above many forecasts. But the company is also a big dollar earner and some of the rise - 30 to 477p - reflected the US currency's move. Scottish Hydro called the expected meeting of analysts but surprised the market by rejecting Offer's regulatory review of the Scottish generators, thereby inviting a reference to the Monopolies &amp; Mergers Commission. Analysts said Hydro gave an impressive defence of its position and picked up hints of the possibility of the MMC taking a hard look at rates of return from the English recs, post their regulatory review, as it investigates Hydro's claims of underfunding of its business. Dealers were alarmed at the possibility that the MMC might reconsider its review. Hydro shares initially fell to 307p on the news, but later rallied to close 5 higher at 318p. Media group Carlton Communications built on recent strong performance as the shares responded to consideration of a trading statement from Rank Organisation. Both companies have video duplication businesses and Rank said its operation was having a much improved year, with volumes up almost 50 per cent and margins widening. Carlton's video and audio production and distribution division accounted for more than half its profits for the six months to end-March and analysts are hoping for good news when the company publishes full-year figures in December. Carlton shares jumped 28 to 878p but Rank was hit by profit taking despite a positive statement and the shares fell 10 1/2 to 399p. Good figures from US rival Omnicom helped advertising group WPP improve 2 to 111p. The oil majors were in the vanguard of the market's advance, with specialists highlighting the sector's obvious exposure to a strengthening dollar. BP hit an all-time high in dollar terms, as US institutions chased the stock in the wake of excellent third quarter results from the leading US oil companies, including Shell Oil. At the close BP were 13 higher at 428 1/2 , just short of the peak 430p reached last month. BP is scheduled to announce third quarter numbers on Tuesday. Specialists also said there is an even chance that the dividend may be increased, with a rise of up to 12 per cent a share a possibility. Shell leapt 19 1/2 to 731p as the market warmed to its US subsidiary's figures and subsequent broker recommendations. Speculation has returned that Unigate, the milk producer, might be poised to sell its 35 per cent stake in Nutricia, the Dutch group. The talk was fuelled yesterday by reports that Unigate was holding a press conference. The shares jumped 9 to 346p but it transpired that the conference was merely an internal meeting and the stock ticked back to only a penny firmer at 338p. BAT Industries was initially restrained by news that the Federal Trade Commission would attempt to block the company's Pounds 600m takeover of American Tobacco. The shares were off 5 at one stage but as one of the stocks most sensitive to US currency and market movements it recovered to close 7 1/2 better at 439 1/2 p. Clothing manufacturer Campari fell 11 to 24p after interim losses of Pounds 3.96m against Pounds 3.09m loss last time. Turnover of 10m in Standard Chartered was the fifth highest this year and reflected continued heavy buying from one of the London market's leading marketmakers; the shares edged up 4 to 290p.</p>

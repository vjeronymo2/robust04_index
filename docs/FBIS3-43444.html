			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pretoria Jan 6 SAPA -- The National Party [NP] on  Thursday condemned the African National Congress' [ANC]  appointment of people with criminal records as election  candidates -- referring specifically to Winnie Mandela and  Robert McBride. "Voters must realise that in this election they  do not vote for one candidate, but for a list of candidates,"  the NP said in a statement.    It mentioned that McBride, sentenced to death three times  for  planting a bomb which killed three and injured scores in a  Durban pub in 1986, was pardoned along with "Wit Wolf" Barend  Strydom who killed seven blacks when he randomly opened fire on  them in Pretoria in 1988.    The NP added that the accommodation of radicals such as ANC  Youth League President Peter Mokaba so high on ANC election  lists was evidence of the stranglehold the South African  Communist Party had on the ANC.</p>

			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / Clinton seeks to overturn Congress delay on Gatt President Bill Clinton said yesterday he will ask the US Senate to remain in session this year until legislation to implement the Uruguay Round trade pact wins approval. His move came after US approval for the creation of the World Trade Organisation, a cornerstone of the 123-nation deal reached last December at the end of the seven-year Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations, ran into legislative difficulties. 'The US has to lead on this and I intend to do everything I can to see that we do lead,' Mr Clinton said. The trade organisation is due to come into existence in January 1995. Enactment of the Uruguay Round deal is already delayed in the European Union and Japan. Yesterday, its ratification by the US was threatened by the decision of the chairman of a powerful Senate committee to hold it up until the end of the Congressional session this autumn. President Clinton said the legislation was supported by a majority in both the House and the Senate and would pass once it came to a vote. If the Senate's Democratic party leadership co-operated with him, the Senate would recess briefly for the November 8 Congressional elections, rather than close off its agenda with a formal adjournment, on October 7, as is normal in advance of elections. Under this plan, Senators would then return after the elections for a rare 'lame duck' sitting to pass the legislation. The legislation, which was delivered to Congress on Tuesday, is expected to pass swiftly through the House of Representatives, which would not have to return after the elections. It passed two House committees yesterday. The president's statement followed a move yesterday by Senator Ernest Hollings, chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, to delay the legislation until after the Congressional adjournment set at present for October 7. As chairman of the committee, Senator Hollings has partial jurisdiction over the legislation, which enables him to hold hearings on it for 45 days. He said he planned extensive hearings and that the legislation would not come to a vote this year. Senator Hollings is a self-proclaimed protectionist who represents US textile producers. It is possible that having made his point, he will hold hearings for a few days or weeks and let the legislation come to a vote before the elections. The administration, weakened by partisan attacks on the president, has made trade a centrepiece of its foreign policy. A defeat on Gatt could be more serious over the long run than the devastating loss of the president's healthcare legislation. Delay in ratifying of the Uruguay Round deal has worried multinational exporters who stand to gain the most from implementation of new trade rules. In the environment of national cynicism, opponents have fanned the flames of protectionism. If the Uruguay Round legislation is not passed this year, it could face a more Republican and protectionist Congress.</p>

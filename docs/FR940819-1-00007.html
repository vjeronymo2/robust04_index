			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (iii) Discuss the requirements of the Agency with respect to compliance with local, regional, and State regulations; construction practices; energy efficiency; nondiscrimination; market analysis; good site planning; and location. Also, when applicable, provide and explain Form FmHA 400&hyph;4, ``Assurance Agreement,'' Form FmHA 400&hyph;1 ``Equal Opportunity Agreement,'' and HUD Form 935.2, ``Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing Plans.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Technical services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Professional assistance is available from the Soil Conservation Service (SCS) and the Cooperative Extension Service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) An applicant or developer for a Multiple Family Housing project or a Single Family Housing site which requires technical services under &sect;1924.13(a) of subpart A of this part, must contract for the technical services of an architect, engineer, land surveyor, landscape architect, or site planner, as appropriate, to provide complete planning, drawings, and specifications. Such services may be provided by the applicant's or developer's ``in house'' staff subject to Agency concurrence. Technical services must be performed by professionals who are qualified and authorized to provide such services in the State in which the project would be developed. All technical services must be provided in accordance with the requirements of professional registration or licensing boards. For payments for technical services, follow &sect;1924.102(c) of this subpart. At completion of all construction or completion of a phase or phases of the total project, the person(s) providing technical services under this section must notify the Agency office in writing that all work has been completed in substantial conformance with the approved plans and specifications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) For developments not specifically required to have technical services under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, such services may be required by the State Director when construction of streets or installation of utilities is involved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Drawings, specifications, contract documents, and other documentations. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Adequate drawings and specifications must be provided by the applicant or developer to fully describe the work. Contract documents must be prepared under &sect;1924.6 or, in the case of more complex construction, &sect;1924.13 of subpart A of this part.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Single Family Housing. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Proposals for development of individual dwelling sites have the following specific requirements:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Site development design requirements. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Exhibit B of this subpart will be used as a guide by applicants or developers in preparing proposals and supporting documents for Single Family Housing loans, in addition to specific requirements made in this subpart.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Environmental review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) An individual Single Family Housing loan is normally considered a Categorical Exclusion under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). However, Form FmHA 1940&hyph;22, ``Environmental Checklist for Categorical Exclusions,'' must be completed by the Agency to determine that the specific action complies not only with NEPA, but also with other applicable environmental laws, executive orders, and regulations. To complete the form, the preparer will use reliable environmental information. Sources of such information include, but are not limited to, the State's Natural Resource Management Guide and the appraisal. If the completed Form FmHA 1940&hyph;22 indicates a potential impact to one or more environmental resources, the action is subject to disqualification as Categorical Exclusion and a Class I assessment must be completed in accordance with &sect;1940.317(g) of subpart G of Part 1940 of this chapter. If it is obvious at the outset that the action will be disqualified as a Categorical Exclusion, the preparer should forego completion of Form FmHA 1940&hyph;22 and proceed directly to the Class I assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) If it appears that an action will be subject to disqualification as a Categorical Exclusion due to indications of cumulative impacts, a Class I or Class II assessment will be completed, as appropriate, in accordance with subpart G of Part 1940 of this chapter. A cumulative impact is the impact on the environment which results from the incremental impact of the proposed action, when added to other past, present and reasonably foreseeable future actions, regardless of what Agency (Federal or non-Federal) or person undertakes such other actions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Multiple Family Housing. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Exhibit C of this subpart should be used as a guide by the applicant or developer in preparing a proposal and supporting documents for Multiple Family Housing projects. Exhibit B of this subpart contains site development design requirements which apply to all Multiple Family Housing projects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;1924.106  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Location.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> General. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  It is the Agency's policy to promote compact community development and not to approve sites located in floodplains, on wetlands, or on important farmlands, unless there is no practical alternative. Furthermore, the Agency will not accept locations that adversely affect properties which are listed or are eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places, located within the Coastal Barrier Resource System, or on a barrier island. In order to be eligible for Agency participation:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Cabinet of Ministers has adopted a resolution  regarding the border zone. The zone is established along  Ukraine's state land border, as well as along banks of border  rivers and water reservoirs, within territories of settlements  and village councils of people's deputies, which are adjacent to  the border.    The resolution also approved general border regulations. In  particular, they stipulate that citizens entering or staying  within the border zone should have documents confirming their  identity and need to enter the zone or remain there. Within the  border zone, auto travel is limited, and a veterinary-sanitary  zone is established, in which the breeding and grazing of  livestock is prohibited. [passage indistinct]</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Mikhail Leontyev report: "Zhirinovskiy's Party Vote May Be </F> Annulled"]    [Text] It took the Russian Central Bank half a day to  react to an article in SEGODNYA on Zhirinovskiy's being financed  by GMM, a Dutch "trust" company carrying out illegal operations  in Russia. The Central Bank has issued a press release  confirming that GMM's operations are illegal and saying that its  activity "jeopardizes the interests of citizens who have  entrusted their savings to it." Curiously, repeated requests by  the Foreign Ministry demanding that the Dutch company, which has  been conducting purely banking operations in Russia without  bothering to obtain any license, be properly dealt with have  been stubbornly ignored by the Central Bank. Nor was Mr.  Gerashchenko's office impressed by an entirely convincing  article in IZVESTIYA on oddities in GMM's activity.    Obviously, it was the political context in which he has  found  himself owing to his friendship with GMM that impressed Mr.  Gerashchenko so strongly in this particular case. Any unbiased  observer can draw this fairly simple sequence of logical  conclusions: the Central Bank chairman, whose position has been  fairly shaky of late, has been covering the illegal activity of  a company of financial black marketeers; the company finances  the penetration into the parliament of deputies meeting its  moral and political standards; subsequently, the deputies  appoint Gerashchenko Central Bank chairman. The only  inconvenience is that the paid deputies are Nazis of sorts.  However, the stunning impudence such people tend to display on  Russian soil has precluded their thinking that anyone might take  a serious interest in this.    The behavior of Mr. Gerashchenko, whom Anton Nenakhov, chief  of GMM's Moscow branch, was praising to the skies in the  "Without Retouching" television program (at the same time  fulminating against Finance Minister Boris Fedorov), is also  very peculiar. Initially he covered the "trust" company's  activity, allowing it to collect millions of dollars from the  population, then, upon suddenly seeing the light, he called it  illegal, thus effectively assuring the bankruptcy of tens of  thousands of investors. One cannot help getting a strange  impression: What if this is a deliberately fabricated affair?  Yet more indirect evidence is that the Central Bank, as far as  I know, has not frozen GMM's accounts. Hence, investors' money  can be siphoned away -- according to its commercial -- round the  clock throughout the world.    The answer to a popular question of to whom one should  address one's claims is simple -- to the Central Bank and its  chairman. Generally speaking, bureaucrats in a normal society  would at least resign in similar circumstances.    Self-assurance prevented the hapless "businessmen" from  noting that financing Nazis is seen as something extremely  inappropriate in civilized countries. As a result, the Dutch  Foreign Ministry has launched an investigation into the activity  of GMM, which turned out to have had no right to engage in  overseas trust operations under the legislation of Holland  (which, unlike this country, does have a trust law). When asked  by DE VOLLKSRANT, a Mr. Van de Meer, a GMM official in  Amsterdam, said that GMM gave Zhirinovskiy as little as $50,000.  He claims that the "trust" company also financed other  "important" candidates, and that large amounts were handed to  "Russia's Choice." Election campaign chiefs of "Russia's  Choice" insist, however, that the bloc has not taken any money  from either GMM or any other foreign companies.    According to the aforementioned Mr. Van de Meer, his chief,  Nenakhov, personally supported a number of candidates as a  private person, guided by his own preferences. Van de Meer sees  this policy as reasonable. "Mr. Nenakhov has one single  political preference, which is money," the official says. The  ingenuity multiplied by his deliberate unscrupulousness may turn  out to be not so "reasonable" as some Western partners tend to  think, mistaking Russia for a banana republic. Under Russian  laws, financing an election campaign of a candidate or a bloc  from foreign sources may give grounds for annulling the votes  cast for the candidates or blocs. Unless we are a banana  republic indeed.</p>

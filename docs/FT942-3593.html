			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / Arts: The acceptable face of the avant-garde - With some relief, William Packer finds contemporary painting alive and well at the Serpentine Gallery JG West's elegant pavilion in Kensington Gardens is now 60 years old. It was designed as a tea room but served its thirsty public for barely half its life. It then lay empty and redundant until, in an uncharacteristic fit of inspiration, the bureaucracies responsible for public order in the Royal Parks fixed upon a new use for it as a gallery for contemporary art. Under the aegis of the Arts Council, it re-opened in 1970, at first only for the summer months. Its scope may have been extended, its facilities improved, its independence under its own trustees at last established, but, with its ample daylight and its long windows opening out on to the park, it is still as pretty and effective a gallery as it is possible to imagine. What it has done with its privileged opportunity over the years is another matter. A careful reader of this column will know, for example, that I was not too keen on the show that Damien Hirst put together only last month, and was less than impressed by recent offerings from Robert Gober or the Barclays Young Artists Awards. Only lately a minor government minister, one Mr Chope, called for the place to be closed down and turned into stables. As a temporary work of installation art, such a proposal might have its merits - as even I, or young Mr Hirst perhaps, can see: but really it goes too far. The fact is that controversy or no controversy, the Serpentine now attracts some 200,000 visitors a year, which by any measure is remarkable for a gallery of its size. It is in the nature of the exercise that the more problematical or outre the exhibition, the more scandalised will be the attention it attracts, especially in this country, where we are suspicious enough of art of any kind, let alone Modern Art: shock, shudder, Picasso an old fraud and all that. The Serpentine's great virtue is that, with its clean, open galleries and natural light, it can show work of any kind to its best advantage. The danger is that if the good can be made to look so marvellous, so the inept may seem acceptable, the banal interesting, the trivial significant. It is all a matter of emphasis, and if the Serpentine's programme seems suddenly to have too narrow a focus and, at the expense of quality, become too bound up with supposed innovation and all the self-mystifying, self-justifying blather of the avant-garde, then it is no more than reasonable for the critic to say so. What is not reasonable is to offer the jackboot's answer to 'Degenerate Art': close it down and kick it out of sight. But the Serpentine may legitimately defend itself on its record overall, saying that to notice only what is controversial in its programme is itself a distortion. The point is made and, up to a point, taken by its current show of British painting. It is well chosen and beautifully hung, giving us a single and typical work by 35 artists, most of whom have been shown at the gallery one way or another over the years. The title is a little misleading, for while all these artists worked on after 1970, and much of the work is very new, the actual examples of one or two of the artists were done long before - the Nicholson, indeed, dating from 1929. But this is to quibble. As a show it does two useful things. First, it clearly demonstrates that for all the talk of the irrelevance, if not the actual death of painting, its practice has continued throughout its period within the established conventions, abstract and figurative, apparently lively and in good health. And it follows from this that far from working in a critical vacuum alongside their conceptualist and installationist contemporaries, younger painters such as Lisa Milroy, Ian Davenport and Fiona Rae may now be seen within a broader context and a richer tradition. Certainly their work appears the stronger for it, seen now in such company as Patrick Caulfield, Bridget Riley, Prunella Clough, John Hoyland or Gillian Ayres. It is not true of all of them. Tony Bevan, for example, can hardly live with Freud or Auerbach, and Mark Wallinger and Richard Hamilton make a fine pair for triviality and pretension. But the gallery is, for the most part, full of strong and beautiful things - Victor Willing's odd flapping suit of clothes, like a suspended carcass, holding its own with Francis Bacon's seated figure; a deceptively simple and expansive Howard Hodgkin; good things from Paula Rego, Albert Irvin, Adrian Berg, Lucian Freud, Terry Frost and many more. Take your pick. Most beautiful of all is the large, new Prunella Clough, with its dark, smoky surfaces and striated stacks. But for all these good and positive things, there is yet one caveat to enter. To go through this work is still to register a sense of the official, or at least established, art of its period. This show offers us the accepted face of modern painting, the face that fits. The Serpentine's avant-garde credentials are safe enough.

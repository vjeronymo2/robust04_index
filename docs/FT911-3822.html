			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / International Company News: Nixdorf holds back Siemens result SIEMENS made a first-half loss of DM380m (Dollars 227m) on its computer activities in the first half of the financial year to September 30, 1991, as it began to integrate the business of Nixdorf, the company which it rescued last year. The continuation of Nixdorf's losses added to the burdens on the German electrical and electronics group at a time when worldwide economic conditions have deteriorated. Its total first-half net profits rose by 6 per cent to DM793m. Siemens did not spell out the extent to which the Nixdorf loss held back its full result; analysts, who pointed out that German companies have considerable accounting leeway in arranging how they report their results, have already forecast lower group earnings per share this year. The group said the loss made by Siemens Nixdorf Informationssysteme, created by the merger of its computer interests with Nixdorf, partly reflected a backlog of DM500m in unbilled sales. This was caused by the time taken to integrate the two companies. New computer orders in the first half totalled DM5.7bn, a fall of 5 per cent, with invoiced sales 17 per cent lower at DM5.1bn; allowing for the backlog, however, sales were less than 10 per cent lower. Siemens said the integration of Nixdorf was going well, but was not completed. Strong gains in orders and sales were recorded in the second quarter. Siemens Nixdorf said recently it might not show a profit for the whole of 1990-91. Nixdorf made a DM800m loss in the last nine months before its full absorption by Siemens in last October; DM300m of this was to meet restructuring costs and valuation changes. The group has already warned that growth in total profits would be difficult this year. In the last financial year, net income rose by 6 per cent to DM1.7bn and Siemens raised its dividend. Outlining overall group progress in the first half, Siemens said it booked a 15 per cent rise in new orders to DM41.4bn, though half the improvement stemmed from the first-time inclusion of new businesses. Domestic orders showed a 30 per cent advance, with business in east Germany, much of it linked to vital infrastructure improvements, totalling DM1.4bn. The group said foreign business stagnated. The 6 per cent rise in foreign orders to DM23bn was mainly due to the inclusion of the merged Siemens Nixdorf operation and the activities acquired from Plessey of the UK. Turnover during the period totalled DM33.1bn, a rise of 9 per cent; of this, 7 percentage points were due to the enlargement of the group.</p>

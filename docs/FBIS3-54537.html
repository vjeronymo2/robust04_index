			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "New Agenda on Arm-Twisting"] </F>   [Text] In a joint statement on nuclear non-proliferation,  Presidents Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin have asked India and  Pakistan to be a part of the multilateral talks aimed at  "transforming the subcontinent into a nuclear-free zone". While  Mr. Clinton's crusading zeal to keep Asia tethered on the other  side of the nuclear divide is old hat, the surprise package is  Mr. Yeltsin's adoption of Mr. Clinton's preachy role -- to India  and Pakistan -- on missile and nuclear non-proliferation. No  doubt, Mr. Yeltsin is toeing the American line, but it is  totally at variance -- therefore, the surprise -- with the more  guardedly prudent stand of the former Soviet Union, which had  not publicly joined the London Club on the nuclear issue. And,  therefore, tactfully avoided pressing India too hard on the NPT  [Nonproliferation Treaty] issue. Mr. Yeltsin apparently has no  such compunctions in joining the Big-League in its  discriminatory attitude of keeping the Third World away from  nuclear technology. India's reluctance to do so is a morally  justifiable one. While she has not balked at the prospect of a  Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty coming into force in 1996, India  has taken exception to the regional pressure that is being  applied on her to accept the NPT, or its regional variation  cobbled together by Islamabad and Washington. The position  taken by the presidents of America and Russia makes little sense  if the nuclear weapons powers continue to exercise their  prerogative of testing and developing their nuclear arsenals. A  vapid declaration of "no first use" sounds even sillier, if also  discriminatory, when the U.S. in particular laughs at any  suggestion of a global ban on nuclear testing as a first step  towards eliminating all nuclear weapons. The "have's", it would  appear, are not so susceptible to U.S. pressures on nuclear  disarmament, and can with impunity cock a snook at Uncle Sam's  vain glorious threats of applying economic sanctions on those  found guilty of testing. China exploded her nuclear device with  aplomb; and North Korea unequivocally showed that "tough  measures" just would not work. But what of the U.S. indulgences  that have been responsible for furnishing Israel's "clandestine  nuclear arsenal," and of overlooking Pakistan's boast of  possessing military nuclear capability? Mr. Clinton and Mr.  Yeltsin would do well to desist from feeding us such pious  homilies on NPT, and revise their opinions on what India should,  or should not, do. India's security imperatives -- surrounded as  she is with nuclear warheads cutting a wide swathe from the  Central Asian Republics to the Indian Ocean and eastwards in  China -- demand a certain policy. There should be global action  for the elimination of all nuclear weapons. Pakistan's premier  Benazir Bhutto has said that her country will not roll back its  nuclear programme "under any circumstances". Surely, there is a  limit to which India can be pushed.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Therefore, FRA has concluded that the requirements contained in this part should apply to a non-general system, non-insular passenger railroad that confines its operations to an installation that is not part of the general system ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , it is a stand-alone with no freight traffic but has one or more features that preclude its being considered insular).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In &sect;232.3(b), FRA proposes to except various train operations from the requirements of this part. These exceptions are taken directly from &sect;6 of the Safety Appliance Acts (45 U.S.C. &sect;6, recodified at 49 U.S.C.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;&sect;20301, 21302, and 21304). It is noted that the word ``freight'' has been added to the exceptions in order to remain consistent with Congress' intent when the statutory exceptions were created. At the time Congress provided an exception from the requirements of the Acts, Congress did not and could not envision that the equipment used in these operations would be modified for the purposes of hauling passengers, which FRA has discovered with regard to four-wheel coal cars. Consequently, FRA will only except freight operations which employ the types of equipment contained in this paragraph.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Section 232.5.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section contains an extensive set of definitions to introduce the regulations. FRA intends these definitions to clarify the meaning of important terms as they are used in the text of the proposed rule. The proposed definitions are carefully worded in an attempt to minimize the potential for misinterpretation of the rule. Several of the definitions introduce new concepts or new terminologies which require further discussion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed definitions classify trains by their maximum operating speed. Trains with a maximum operating speed of 79 mph or less are defined as ``conventional trains.'' Trains with a maximum operating speed of more than 79 mph but less than or equal to 125 mph are defined as ``intermediate speed trains.'' Trains with a maximum operating speed greater than 125 mph but less than or equal to 160 mph are defined as ``high speed trains.'' FRA proposes these definitions because as the operating speed of a train increases a greater variety of safety-related conditions and equipment need to be addressed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The definition of ``excursion train'' is intended to encompass those trains operated by what are referred to in the industry as ``tourist,'' ``excursion,'' and ``scenic'' railroads. When the term ``excursion train'' is used in these proposed rules, it is intended to refer to those non-insular tourist, excursion, and scenic railroads as explained in the discussion of &sect;232.3. For purposes of these proposed rules, FRA feels that the trains operated by these types of railroads can be sufficiently dealt with as a group. FRA defines ``train brake system'' to encompass any and all of the components involved to apply a retarding force to decelerate a train. This definition is a key to FRA's approach to treat train brakes as a complex system of inter-related components that must function in harmony to safely slow and stop a train. The definition clearly includes computer programs or other forms of software used to control or test braking functions as part of the train brake system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The definition of ``train brake information system'' introduces a new concept. FRA proposes to require railroads to develop and implement a set of procedures to ensure that as train crews take responsibility for a train they have accurate and timely information on board the train, which includes the recent brake test history of the train and the current status of the brakes on all locomotives and cars comprising the train. FRA feels that this information is necessary to allow trains to proceed for greater distances between required train brake system tests. FRA concludes that this information is essential in order for railroads to know if their trains are in compliance with federal safety regulations. Furthermore, placing the information in the hands of the train crew increases railroad safety because the train crews are in the best position to make decisions based on the information to eliminate or reduce brake-related safety problems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

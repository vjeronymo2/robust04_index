Hercules C-130s flying from the Republic of  Zaire and South Africa have been landing regularly in Andulo,  carrying war materiel and fuel for UNITA rebel forces. This was  revealed by citizen Domingos Lucas, who abandoned the Black  Cockerel ranks on 11 March, turning himself over to government  authorities in Kunje Commune. He said his decision was prompted  by ill-treatment in the bush. Speaking at a news conference,  Lucas said once unloaded, the war materiel and fuel are taken to  Caluapanda and to Huambo Province. He said a light aircraft is  permanently based in Andulo to carry Jonas Savimbi. Lucas said  UNITA is transferring civilians and troops from Jamba to Andulo,  presumably to shift its central base to Bie Province.</p>

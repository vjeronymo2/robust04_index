			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Amman--QUDS PRESS--The Hamas [Islamic Resistance]  Movement has asked Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat to step  aside and resign his leadership of the Palestinian people,  accusing him of representing only himself and an isolated group,  which is oppressing our Palestinian people, as a responsible  source in the movement said.    Commenting on a letter 'Arafat sent in response to a letter  to him by Dr. Musa Abu-Marzuq, chief of the Hamas political  bureau, the source said:    We in the Hamas Movement were astonished by the way 'Arafat  replied to our letter in which we asked him to return to  national ranks and make the courageous decision to withdraw from  the negotiations. We believed the horrible massacre of  worshipers in Hebron would shake 'Arafat to his foundations and  prompt him to reconsider and withdraw from the negotiations.  However, nothing of the kind happened. 'Arafat attempted to  absorb the overwhelming popular indignation against his  collapsing policy.    By saying in his letter that a deviation from his and the  PLO's policy is a deviation from the national consensus, 'Arafat  seems to be saying that the majority of the Palestinian people  are outside the national consensus and that he regards only  himself and his capitulating minority as the entire Palestinian  people. This is gross contempt for our people and their  fighting forces. It appears 'Arafat is unaware of the pulse of  the indignant Palestinian masses who are angry with him and his  capitulationist policy, and his shaky stand against the Ibrahimi  Mosque massacre.    The PLO's conditions for returning to negotiations are  flimsy  and cannot be compared with the size of the massacre. Yet  'Arafat and his cohorts would soon decide to resume negotiations  the moment their U.S. master makes a decision to this effect.    We ask 'Arafat to step aside and resign his leadership of  the  Palestinian people because he represents only himself and an  isolated group that is oppressing our people.    SAWT AL-SHA'B publishes herewith the verbatim text of  'Arafat's letter in answer to the letter sent by the chief of  the Hamas political bureau as disseminated by Palestinian  embassies and press agencies:    I have read your letter on the deplorable massacre  perpetrated by fanatic Israeli settlers, with the participation  and support of Israeli Army units, against our steadfast, pious  people who were kneeling in prayer at the Ibrahimi Mosque in the  city of Khalil al- Rahman [Abraham]. God said in his clear book  of wisdom: But those who are slain in the way of God, He will  never let their deeds be lost; soon will he guide them and  improve their condition and admit them to the garden which he  has announced for them. [Koranic verses]    This is the time for unity, solidarity, and unity of ranks  and not for division and differences. We are now in need of  unity and cohesion more than ever before because we are waging a  very fierce battle to find a drastic and comprehensive solution  to the problem of settlements and to disarming the settlers and  to ensure international protection for our people. The souls of  our pious martyrs, all of our martyrs, are beacons to light our  path in order to enter Palestine raising the banners of Jihad,  struggle, and victory. Our direction is holy Jerusalem, the  first of the two qiblahs, the third holiest mosque, and the  capital of our independent state. We are potential martyrs on  the way to Palestine. Then give the glad tidings to the  believers. [Koranic verse]    Palestine has returned to the political and geographical  map,  thanks to decades of Palestinian people's jihad and struggle on  all levels and forums. The savage and deplorable murders  committed by the fanatic extremists are a desperate attempt to  prevent our people from reaching their national aims of ending  the Israeli occupation and saving our Islamic and Christian holy  places from the yoke of occupation and restoring our people's  inalienable national rights, including their right to return, to  exercise self-determination, and to establish their independent  state with holy Jerusalem as its capital.    Palestine is the focus of our attention and the dearest  place  to our hearts. It is the bride whose dowry is paid by the lives  of our men. Struggle and jihad will continue to regain it and  realize just peace for it so that our Palestinian people will be  able to live in peace, justice, and stability. Everyone is  asked to stand together behind the PLO, our people's sole  legitimate representative, in its policy and methods that have  been approved by the our successive national councils.    To deviate from these policies is to deviate from the  national consensus, causes great harm to our people's just  cause. In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate.  And we shall try you until we test those among you who strive  their utmost and persevere in patience, and we shall try your  reported mettle. [Koranic verse]    We pray to almighty God to grant us one of the two favors:  either victory or martyrdom.</p>

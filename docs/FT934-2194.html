			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / Arts: 'Effects' can make or mar the programme - Television Now that BBC1's hugely enjoyable series To Play The King has ended (with all the pieces neatly stored in position for a third story as soon as Michael Dobbs can write it) will BBC2's Stark take its place as the weekly drama treat we look forward to? Probably not. Stark, adapted by Ben Elton from his own novel, and starring Elton as the sex-starved nerd who stumbles across a conspiracy to pollute and take over the world, looks good enough: the Australian locations and the cast are more than adequate. But there is nothing here to compare with Ian Richardson's virtuoso performance as 'FU', the vulpine politician in To Play The King. Furthermore, Elton's story, which seems to be a sort of green thriller, carries little conviction either as a thriller (it feels like a parody) or as a piece of environmental campaigning. Elton may genuinely feel strongly about such matters as toxic waste, but that is not the impression you get from Stark. His character's desire to get long legged mini-skirted Rachel into bed is much more convincing. In the end it was Michael Ignatieff's bottomless reservoir of liberal understanding that was the undoing of Blood And Belonging. Of course sympathy for the refugee, the widow, the persecuted minority is admirable and perhaps even a necessity if you are to gain access and complete your series when your subject is nationalism. But given how appallingly destructive the mindless love of landscape has proved over so many centuries, given the insane vehemence with which people fight, even unto death, for the sake of a few folk songs, unconvincing fairy stories and embroidered waistcoats (all right, 'national costume') it is surely the duty of a man with Ignatieff's intelligence to take a somewhat sceptical view of nationalism. 'All very well for someone secure in his own culture and country to be so dismissive', you may say, but it would seem to me as sensible (or, rather, as stupid) to die for the Apennines and Catholicism as for the Chilterns and morris dancing. Ignatieff spent his time listening sympathetically to people from Croatia to Canada who were only too eager to pour out their totalitarian bile for his cameras. Perhaps he would have made fewer friends but showing a little more anger at the futility and destructiveness of this attachment to myths and mountains would have made for a better series. Rhodes Boyson on Clive Anderson Talks Back: 'Mrs Thatcher was a tremendous person. I liked her very much. You could bounce golf balls off her without her noticing'. Do television producers bother to watch their own programmes prior to transmission ? If the answer is yes, then perhaps they should try watching them on the video recorders in their own homes rather than on professional studio equipment. The thought is prompted by this week's 'Performance' drama on BBC2: The Changeling. All the viewers I have spoken to have said the same thing: thanks to the 'background' music, foreground sound effects, and the actors' insistence on mumbling, it was difficult and sometimes impossible to hear the lines, at least in the early part of the play. If this was obvious to viewers why not to the professionals? Either they believe that the music and sound effects are more important than the words, or they are so familiar with the text that they do not notice the words cannot be heard. Or they just do not care. Whatever the reason, it is time someone high up in the broadcasting world did something to stop the slide towards the inaudible, not only in television but, ludicrously, in radio too. It may also be time for someone to tell Bob Hoskins, who played De Flores, that there are more ways of expressing emotion than widening your eyes while gritting your teeth together and flailing your lips around. If he has nothing to replace this limiting and amateurish habit, he should be told to go and watch Anthony Hopkins' performance in The Remains Of The Day which provides a masterclass in the facial expression of emotion without words. Alan Yentob, Controller of BBC1, has a nice sense of humour. If you had said last week that it was possible to produce an Omnibus documentary about the death of Tchaikovsky which would make Ken Russell's movie The Music Lovers look quite restrained, most people would have laughed like drains. Yet John Purdie and Anthony Holden managed it. As alternatives to the standard yarn about the composer dying after drinking a glass of water from the cholera tainted river (the version favoured by previous biographers including Russell) Holden offered two other possibilities: that he was ordered to commit suicide by a kangaroo court of old-boys from school because of his homosexuality, or that he contracted cholera from one of St Petersburg's rent boys. Yentob's little joke was to screen The Music Lovers immediately after the Omnibus. Thus we could watch Andrew Faulds, MP, shamelessly over acting, and Glenda Jackson, MP, in a nude scene that was long and melodramatic even by Russell's standards. For anyone with a more than recreational interest in television, it is worth catching at least one episode of Channel 4's new Monday night police series Homicide since it will probably prove seminal without ever being awfully popular. The theme is entirely conventional: stories of a group of over worked detectives, this time in Baltimore. It is virtually impossible today to make an American police series which does not owe debts to Hill Street Blues, and sure enough Homicide interweaves the stories of various detectives and teams of detectives; moreover the attitudes and idiosyncracies of individuals are as important as the plots. Last week producer/director Barry Levinson kept the entire episode inside the precinct room, with the air conditioning broken down, a challenge which looked more like a student exercise in script writing than a real attempt to entertain the viewer. It is the style, however, which is likely to be copied elsewhere. Levinson is using all sorts of techniques from journalism and sport to make Homicide look different. When people talk the camera is often hand-held, creeping right round them or swinging jerkily from one to another, as in a fly-on-the-wall documentary. During interviews he will fade to black instead of mixing or cutting. Every now and then he throws in a multiple-image shot, a bit like that famous photograph of a golf swing showing the club in all 360 degrees of a circle, or simply repeats a shot quickly while the dialogue continues. Much of it looks like tricksiness for its own sake, but it also looks undeniably different and it will be a surprise if other programme makers do not follow suit. It turned out that If You See God Tell Him was not a situation comedy at all, but a situation tragedy. We should have guessed from the length of the episodes (45 minutes) and the absence of a laughter track that something was afoot, but what fooled us were the writers: we knew Marshall and Renwick from Hot Metal and Alexei Sayle's Stuff and assumed they would give us more comedy. Actually Godfrey Spry, absolute believer in the literal truth of the advertising slogan, stood revealed in the last (delayed) episode as a truly tragic figure, tried and convicted for a murder he did not commit.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by AFP correspondent Gerardo Tena] </F>   [Text] Altamirano, Mexico, 4 Jan (AFP) -- Several lines of  Indian peasants advanced this Tuesday on the road from  Altamirano to San Cristobal, which are separated by 100 km,  fleeing their communities.    Peasants can be seen carrying their belongings on this  stretch of road, but there is no presence of rebels or the  regular Army--whose presence is demanded by residents--as in the  preceding days.    Residents of Elzay, a community of 300 Tzeltal Indians, who  advanced on the route said that the guerrillas were entrenched  in the community of Tolbeja, approximately eight km from Oxchuc.    Peasant Sebastian Lopez said that all the Elzay residents  were leaving that community, because the members of the EZLN  [Zapatista National Liberation Army] "considered us their  enemies, because we were not with them."    The Indians who are fleeing are forced to walk, because  public transportation service has been suspended as a result of  the insecurity of traveling on the road in addition to the many  barricades placed along the way.    In the communities leading from Altamirano, residents say  they only have enough food for a few days, and in the places  where there is telephone service the lines have been cut.    "Here, there is no authority, and the military has not come  to set things straight after the EZLN members left," an Oxchuc  resident explained.    "We do not have water, electricity, or food, and we are  asking for the Army's help," said Gloria Clemente, 30, a  resident of Altamirano, a town that was abandoned this morning  by rebel forces.</p>

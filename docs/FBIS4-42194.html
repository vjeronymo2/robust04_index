			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Elisabeth Auvillain: "Roman Herzog: President </F> of the Whole of Germany"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The CDU's [Christian Democratic  Union] Roman Herzog will have a difficult task continuing the  work started by Richard von Weizsaecker, his predecessor, who  constantly called for tolerance and the acceptance of  differences. Since unification, Germany has been going through a  period of instability and uncertainty, which has led some young  extremists to use foreigners as scapegoats for all society's  ills. The result is that attacks on foreigners are increasing.    In the more strictly political sphere, Roman Herzog's  victory  is a success for Chancellor Kohl, who had seemed to make an  error of judgment, which is rare for him, by proposing the  candidacy of Saxony Justice Minister Steffen Heitmann. The  latter had been forced to withdraw after angering many  politicians, even within the CDU by expressing particularly  conservative opinions. His nomination led the liberals (FDP  [Free Democratic Party]) to propose their own candidate, Mrs.  Hamm-Bruecher, and to maintain her even after Heitmann's  withdrawal.    Herzog's election is also a success for the whole of the  government coalition which, despite some provocative statements  by the liberals over recent days, finally voted unanimously for  the CDU candidate. It also strengthens the impression that the  FDP is primarily anxious to stand by the government's side,  wherever it is.    The supporters of the SPD [Social Democratic Party] are  disappointed and simply hope that Roman Herzog, who cannot be  described as a reactionary, will show openness and liberalism.  The Socialists recently mentioned the possibility of having the  president elected by universal suffrage. All the opinion polls  show that, in that case, Johannes Rau would have been elected.  But, although there is no doubt that Richard von Weizsaecker,  who was a great president, was very popular, this cannot be a  guarantee of competence, and history has taught that a man's  popularity should be distrusted.</p>

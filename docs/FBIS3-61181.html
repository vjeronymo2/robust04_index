He explained that it is much more important to  define the set of qualities that a contender for this job must  possess. Popov put at the top of this list experience of running  an individual region. It is hard to argue with this. In the  United States, too, in most cases the president is a politician  who has sat in a governor's chair. How many such people do we  have, with names familiar to most? Boris Nemtsov, Yuriy Luzhkov,  Anatoliy Sobchak.... It is true that the image of the latter has  faded somewhat since we saw him first at the USSR Congress of  People's Deputies. But, as they say, it is not over yet.  Society's moods are changeable....    [Yablonskiy] Anatoliy Aleksandrovich, to what extent were  you  aware of the preparations for the president's Edict No. 1400 of  21 September?    [Sobchak] I anticipated it, although the precise date was a  surprise for me. I learned of this edict from television, just  like everybody else. Such decisions had to be made sooner or  later. Not long before this edict, the Supreme Soviet handed the  president another set of amendments to the Constitution. For all  practical purposes, they abolished the office of the president,  and there was no doubt that the Congress would pass these  amendments to the Constitution. This way, they would have dealt  with the president without any impeachment.    [Yablonskiy] Have you ever advised the president to take  this  step?    [Sobchak] This issue has never been discussed directly. At  the presidential council we always discuss the situation and  propose some or other way to resolve it. Immediately after the  Constitutional Conference, when three-quarters of its  participants approved the draft Basic Law, I proposed  immediately to move toward holding a referendum or to attempt to  bring the question of approving the new Constitution at the  Congress of People's Deputies, putting only this one issue on  the agenda. Otherwise, the president himself would have to make  a decision on calling for early elections.    [Yablonskiy] As a jurist, however, do you see here some  things that are incorrect from the standpoint of law?    [Sobchak] During a period of transition, things that are  incorrect from the standpoint of law happen all the time. In  1991 the Congress practically unanimously voted to strip USSR  people's deputies of their powers, although it had no power to  make such a decision.... People's deputies voted not only for  themselves, but sometimes for up to 10 people, which makes any  decision ever passed by the parliament, or even the existence of  this body, questionable.    We have a lot of things that are not legitimate. This is  inevitable, because we live by a mixed law, 90 percent of which  is still a holdover from the communist era.    [Yablonskiy] Were you against the disintegration of the  Soviet Union?    [Sobchak] Yes.    [Yablonskiy] In your opinion, does Russia face the same  problem now?    [Sobchak] The situation in the Soviet Union was different.  Russia is not facing a problem of disintegration today. Here is  why. All the former republics of the Soviet Union have had a  taste of independence and now want to unite. They understand  that even such a strong power as Ukraine cannot survive alone.    [Yablonskiy] But purely Russian regions now are talking  about  seceding from Russia. Are you not concerned that....    [Sobchak] A trend is developing of disintegrating into  individual fiefdoms? This process does present, of course, a  certain danger. But if the federal government acts firmly and  decisively, this will not happen. I think it would suffice  simply to stop allocating money from the federal budget to any  region, and it will immediately collapse financially.    [Yablonskiy] Anatoliy Aleksandrovich, what is Russia? What  kind of country is it--neither a Soviet republic nor the  sovereign RSFSR?    [Sobchak] I believe that Russia ceased to exist as a state  in  October 1917. And did not exist until October 1991; it had been  completely integrated into the structures of the unitary Soviet  Union, just like all the other republics. Such system existed  only for administrative convenience, keeping track of CPSU  members, and organizing party committees. Here are two examples  that show that in essence the Russian state did not exist. In  1922 the Politburo of the Russian Communist (Bolshevik) Party's  Central Committee makes a decision to transfer to Ukraine  Russian territories with centers in Kharkov, Odessa, Yuzovka  (Donetsk), and Kherson. With this wording: "For the purpose of  strengthening the proletarian stratum and influence in Ukraine,  to make these Russian provinces part of Ukraine." The second  decision: in 1954, under Khrushchev--on transferring the Crimea  to Ukraine. Again, it is the party leadership that makes the  decision--not other bodies, even though they exist for the sake  of formality. What kind of state is it? There was no Russian  state. This period is a black hole in its history. The Russian  state was restored only in 1991....    [Yablonskiy] But this time within the borders of some  Russian  SFSR [Soviet Federated Socialist Republic]....    [Sobchak] Yes, but on a different basis. I believe that  today  Russia cannot raise the issue of border revisions, because it  will inevitably lead to a war. It is in the interests of Russia  today to ensure normal development within the RSFSR's borders. I  do not preclude the possibility, however, that in time many  Russian territories that have been transferred to Ukraine,  Kazakhstan, and Belarus will return to Russia. The historic  trend in this respect is very clear.    [Yablonskiy] You had said that it is necessary to close the  borders with the Baltics. One gets the impression, however, that  you want to preserve this unstable equilibrium, with the Russian  border seemingly being here, and at the same time not here....  So what do we do about the border?    [Sobchak] I believe that the border should be closed. We can  use for this purpose the troops being withdrawn from the Baltics  and Europe--deploy them along the border and shut off  uncontrolled exports of material valuables from Russia. We need  to establish normal customs ties and movement of goods between  Russia and the countries of the former USSR. A considerable  number of crimes here--between 60 and 80 percent--are committed  by persons from the Caucasus region, most of whom are citizens  of other countries. They come here, commit crimes, and then go  back to their republics, and you cannot initiate criminal  proceedings against them. This by itself is a good reason to  close the borders. If we have economic agreements with our  neighbors on the freedom of movement of goods, we have to put in  place such customs and border controls that would check the  legality of movement of people from one republic to another.    [Yablonskiy] Speaking of economic cooperation between  countries of "a different caliber," can one say seriously that  Russia has lost political influence after the disintegration of  the COMECON and the USSR?    [Sobchak] It depends how you define "political influence."  There is influence that is exerted purposefully, crudely,  visibly.... Such crude influence is becoming a thing of the  past. But there also is another kind. When people cooperate,  communicate well, and know one another, it is a completely  different kind of influence. One should not be afraid of it. And  one should exert influence. For instance, the conflict in  Yugoslavia could have been stopped had influential arbiters,  with whom the country had traditional and very strong ties, been  brought in in time. It was Yugoslavia's back luck that Russia,  and others among its traditional friends, were at the time busy  with their own affairs.    [Yablonskiy] Do you intend to run for president?    [Sobchak] I do not intend to answer that question until the  presidential election campaign begins. When it is announced, I  will make my decision. I do think that today being the president  of Russia is a kamikaze job. And it is not easy to decide for  yourself whether it is worth it to be a kamikaze.</p>

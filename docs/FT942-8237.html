			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Leading Article: On the Fed's coat tails Having teased the world's capital markets for three and a half months with slow, small and painful increases in interest rates, the US Federal Reserve this week showed a more decisive bent. In raising both the federal funds rate and the largely symbolic discount rate by half a point apiece, the Fed took its monetary policy closer to a neutral stance after a prolonged period in which real interest rates had been held artificially low to restore the banking system to health. In the short run it was rewarded with a positive response in the bond markets. Are things finally back to normal, after the period of turbulence that has afflicted bond, equity and currency markets since February? Not entirely, for reasons that will become apparent. But this is no criticism of the Fed and its chairman, Mr Alan Greenspan. The Fed lacks the autonomy of the Bundesbank. It operates in a political climate where it is not easy to raise rates before there is general agreement on the necessity to do so. Yet consensus invariably comes too late for monetary policy to perform the task of pre-empting inflationary pressures as opposed to fire-fighting when things are already out of control. By describing his policy as a return to neutrality, the persuasive Mr Greenspan has conveyed the impression that he is simply delivering a little less of what everyone wants, rather than piling on the agony. And he appears to have persuaded the administration that there is political advantage in slowing growth in 1994 to pave the way for a buoyant economy before the 1996 presidential election. His reward has been to see President Clinton accept the latest rise in short-term interest rate with as much equanimity as the bond market. That is not something that the average Fed chairman expects at this point in the economic cycle. Further turbulence After a choppy period in which bond investors took fright at the robustness of recent economic data and questioned the administration's commitment to price and exchange rate stability, US bond prices are now more or less back to where they were a month ago. One reason for thinking that the market turbulence is not over yet is that so many other bond markets are in precisely the same position. UK gilts are no exception, even after their recent fillip. For while the premium in gilt yields over German bond yields narrowed this week, the picture over one month is scarcely very different in either country. This tendency of the bond markets to move in sync, following the US lead, means that many economies that lag far behind the US recovery are saddled with unsuitable and unsustainable real long-term rates of interest. Exchange rates are failing to compensate for these apparent misalignments in bond rates. The implication, if this continues, is that some economies may have to adjust to market perversity by retreating back into recession, since high real bond rates can have a powerful contractionary influence. Another more specific indication of the pent-up pressure is the behaviour of the dollar. Despite the magnitude of the Fed's interest rate increase, the US currency continued to defy those who expect currencies to respond to interest rate differentials. Market intervention This was no doubt disappointing to US Treasury secretary Lloyd Bentsen, who had presumably hoped that the Fed's move would complete an operation that started with a statement that he saw 'no advantage in an undervalued currency' and which was buttressed by co-ordinated exchange market intervention. The aim had been to put a floor under the dollar and reactivate long-term capital flows into the US. The trouble is that the industrialised countries balance of payments and capital flows, like their economies, are out of line. Not only does the US have a structural current account deficit; it is exporting long-term portfolio capital again, having been a substantial capital importer under the Reagan and Bush administrations. But by knocking the stuffing out of US bond and equity markets with its decision to tighten policy, the Fed has deterred portfolio investors from abroad. And the Japanese, who have lost too much in dollar assets over the past 10 years to take a statement from the US Treasury secretary on trust, have pulled in their horns. Confronted with this problem of a current account deficit and excessive capital outflow, the US can either seek an adjustment by letting relative prices change - letting the dollar drop - or have the adjustment come through a change in economic activity in the US relative to its trading partners. That means other countries growing faster. The latter course is not impossible with signs of economic recovery in Europe. And with the inflow of short-term capital into the US being replaced by a build-up of official foreign reserves, notably in Japan, the possibility of rapid Japanese money supply growth is on the cards again. That would help to reignite Japanese economic growth which in turn would go a long way to redressing the US problem.</p>

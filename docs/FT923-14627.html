			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Renewed pessimism as rate hopes fade INTEREST rate optimism melted away like summer snow on the London stock market yesterday, leaving share prices to crumble in the face of the flow of bad news on the economic and corporate fronts. With sterling floundering following Italy's move to higher interest rates, and initial reports from the G7 summit offering little confidence for expansion of world economies, shares quickly turned lower. Gloomy views of the domestic economy were fuelled by news that consumer credit continued to fall in May, while disclosure of a rise in new car sales last month did little to rally confidence. At worst, the FT-SE Index was more than 34 points off, although it recovered slightly by the close. London shied away from the fall of 6.75 on the Dow in early trading, which indicated that the US market continued to find little solace in last week's cut in the Federal discount rate. The FT-SE index ended the day at 2,469 exactly, a loss of 28.1. The market is still hanging uncomfortably inside the gain of 152 points achieved on April 10, after the re-election of Mr John Major's Conservative government. On April 9, polling day, the Footsie closed at 2,436.4; last night, traders were looking apprehensively at the gap of only 32.6 points left before the market slumps into its pre-election territory. Worries regarding corporate activity were emphasised by the failure of Forte to clinch the sale of its contract catering divisions, announced after the market closed on Friday. Union Discount, the UK bill discount and finance house, passed its interim dividend after announcing a Pounds 15m half-year loss. Asda, the supermarket group, announced a Pounds 365m loss and elsewhere among consumer issues, brewery stocks weakened. But once again, much of the interest was focused around the stock index futures sector, where several UK securities houses were sellers of the September contract on the FT-SE Index. The stock market looked thoroughly demoralised and the only favourable trend was the absence of selling pressure or, indeed, of investment activity of any description. Trading volume was extremely thin; Seaq volume was still below 100m shares at 11.00am. By the end of the day, volume had reached only 274.8m shares - 'Christmas Eve business', said one trader - compared with 429.9m on Friday. Daily turnover remained well below Pounds 1bn last week and yesterday was clearly no better. Wall Street-orientated stocks, like Rank Organisation, Reuters and Reed International, took punishment. One of the weakest spots in the market was ICI, as brokers warned that the company is a victim of the slowdown in world economies and the share price is held back by awareness that a US house holds a large stake which it needs to sell in the market. Among the international blue chips, only BP, still smarting from its recent misfortunes, managed to hold steady, encouraged by support from investors taking the view that the downturn has been overdone.</p>

			<p><P> February 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHEN 'JAVA JOINTS' WERE DIME A DOZEN  </P> <P> I don't know how long Kevin Allman's been around Los Angeles, but coffee houses  (not shops) were plentiful as weeds in the '60s ("Java Joints," Jan. 28).  </P> <P> There were at least two in one block at one time on the strip. They were like  bat caves, with games and weird art and everything the current ones offer.  Granted, the music was more of the "We Shall Overcome" variety.  </P> <P> It's fascinating how each batch of young people think they invented coffee  houses. I expect they'll be around forever.  </P> <P> JOHN DEGATINA, Los Angeles  </P></p>

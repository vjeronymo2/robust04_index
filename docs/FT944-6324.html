			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Observer: Power play at BP What does Railtrack's Bob Horton make of the reshuffle at his old shop - BP? He could be forgiven for feeling a bit bitter at the sight of his old rival David Simon getting the chair, while his former protege, John Browne, is promoted to chief executive. BP is a much happier ship than it was two and a half years ago when Horton lost his job after upsetting everybody. Even so, both men owe a lot to Horton. When Horton was given the job of turning round BP's poor performing US affiliate, Standard Oil, Browne was his right hand man and encouraged to make his mark on Wall Street. As for Simon, he has followed most of the policies set in train during Horton's controversial two and a half years at the top of BP. Simon has been rewarded with the chairmanship of Britain's third biggest company, while Horton was made the scapegoat for BP's problems and has been relegated to running Railtrack. As for Horton's old boss at BP, Sir Peter Walters, he goes from strength to strength. Having exchanged the chairmanship of Midland for the deputy chairmanship of HSBC Holdings, he has just taken on the chairmanship of SmithKline Beecham and is an asset to any board of directors. Is there anybody out there in the private sector who will give Bob Horton a second chance? Otherwise, he'll just have to stick around long enough to hope he can treble his salary on privatisation.</p>

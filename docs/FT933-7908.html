			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / Russia begins mass immunisation programme: More than 4,000 cases of diphtheria reported this year RUSSIA yesterday announced a mass immunisation programme of its 150m population in an attempt to halt a diphtheria epidemic. Children will be inoculated first, but adults will have to wait until next year, officials in Moscow said. Immunisation of the whole population will take two years. More than 4,000 cases of diphtheria have been reported in Russia so far this year, with about 100 deaths. Local authorities and medical experts blame deteriorating living standards and inadequate health supplies. Diphtheria generally attacks the throat and tonsils and can severely damage the heart and kidneys. Other diseases are also reported to be on the increase. The incidence of tuberculosis in Russia is up 26 per cent this year, Dr Andrei Monisov, deputy head of the Russian government agency which deals with epidemics, said yesterday in Moscow. Typhoid fever, which hit the southern Russian city of Volgodonsk earlier this month, has infected 106 people. The central Russian region of Altai has been declared 'a zone of increased danger' because of an outbreak of anthrax, which 71 people contracted from diseased meat. Moscow and St Petersburg have been hit hardest by diphtheria, but the epidemic has struck other regions of the country. Earlier this week a quarantine was introduced in the Siberian town of Abakan when seven soldiers in a military unit were diagnosed with diphtheria and another 43 identified as carriers. In Ukraine, Ms Roberta Feldman, an American who headed the International Finance Corporation's small-scale privatisation programme, fell ill earlier this year. A Ukrainian doctor treated her with five times the normal dose of out-of-date penicillin - the only appropriate medicine on hand in Kiev - and the symptoms abated. About two weeks later Ms Feldman saw her doctor in the US. His diagnosis - yet to be confirmed by laboratory analysis - was that she was suffering from bubonic plague. Ms Feldman still has a scar on her forehead but has otherwise recovered. Ms Feldman's experience is isolated - only one other case of plague seems to have been detected recently in the former Soviet Union - but is indicative of the spate of rare diseases making a disturbing reappearance. Dr Monisov said the severity of the diphtheria outbreak was because large numbers of Russians have not been immunised. Many Russians have recently begun to refuse to allow their children to be inoculated because of the fear that unsterilised needles might be used to administer the vaccine. 'There is a portion of the population in Moscow which does not trust state medicine,' he said. According to Dr Monisov, less than 15 per cent of the adult population in Russia has been inoculated against the disease. He said that the government is stepping up its drive to inoculate Russian children with safe, disposable syringes, but that Russia would not be able to produce enough vaccine to treat adults until next year. Dr Monisov said that, with 812 cases of diphtheria this year in Moscow out of a total population of more than 9m, the statistical chance of contracting the disease is slim. However, he encouraged tourists to be vaccinated before travelling to Russia. Thomson Holidays, one of Britain's largest travel groups, has suspended tours to Moscow and St Petersburg from the end of August. 'Thomson just didn't feel comfortable about sending any more tours to Russia,' the company said. It said Thomson clients had found it difficult to obtain inoculations against diphtheria on short notice in Britain. Russian health officials attributed the increased incidence of infectious diseases to the worsening economic situation and to the greater mobility of the population since the collapse of the Soviet Union.</p>

			<p><P> February 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SAN FRANCISCO;  </P> <P> ASYLUM BID SNAGS SMUGGLING TRIAL  </P> <P> Three men accused of smuggling heroin from China sewn inside the bellies of  goldfish have asked that the case be dismissed because a prosecution witness  from China has asked for political asylum. U.S. District Judge William Orrick  set Monday for a hearing on how to proceed with the trial. Shanghai witness  Wang Zong Xiao threw the trial into turmoil last week when he asked for asylum,  claiming he was told to lie about portions of the smuggling case and to refuse  to talk about prison conditions in China.  </P> <P> Orrick placed Wang under court protection until the resolution of his asylum  request, now pending before the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service, to  prevent his sudden return to China. The State Department refused to comment on  the case, but is expected to review and recommend how to handle Wang's request.  The Chinese Consulate in San Francisco condemned Orrick's action as "utter  defiance of basic international laws and norms governing international  relations." Wang said in a written statement that he was beaten and tortured in  Shanghai during 1988 and witnessed the beating and torture of pro-democracy  students and journalists while he was held by the Public Security Bureau. He  also said he was ordered not to discuss the conditions in Shanghai and fears  for his life if he is returned to China.  </P></p>

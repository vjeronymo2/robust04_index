			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / Cookery: Soups for summer YESTERDAY was sun hat and sandal weather. Tonight I am lighting the fire. Planning menus ahead has become a gamble. Last-minute impulse shopping and cooking is one sensible solution. In practice I find British summer evenings rarely so hot that the thought of an entirely cold meal is enticing. A hot main course (providing it is not too substantial) is usually best. Poaching and steaming are good cooking methods to choose. Grilling may be the most appealing of all, not least because it is so quick. What is more, if grilling is done outdoors on a barbecue, the workload may be shifted onto other shoulders or at least shared. Juicy lamb chops, young rabbit, chicken and quail, vegetables and fish of all sorts, make good candidates on these occasions, and all are delicious simply served with a few new potatoes and a leafy salad. If the weather is in a Mediterranean mood, try to rid yourself of the British obsession with red-hot food and plates. Tiede can be a desirable temperature for dishes other than quiche. Preface the grill with soup and follow it with soft fresh fruits and cheese, and you have a meal that is relatively little sweat for the cook. Two of the following soups should be served chilled. This means that they need to be made several hours ahead, but that does not mean burning your culinary boats if the weather turns chilly, just a postponement of serving the soup. (Soup can be kept safely in the fridge for 2-3 days; if the barometer plummets, freeze it for longer safekeeping.) On cool evenings, begin dinner instead with an impromptu and quickly prepared little comforter, such as oeuf en cocotte a la creme. This classic French standby is long overdue for a comeback in Britain. If there is a Sainsbury's branch near you, use its lovely creme fraiche d'Isigny to make this dish, with a blade or two of tarragon for fragrance. The other soup given here is the turncoat, capable of beating the weather at its own game. In other words it is equally good served chilled if the evening is fine or hot if the weather plays foul. LOVAGE SOUP WITH BUTTERMILK (serves 4-6) 2-3 shallots;  3/4 -1 lb potatoes; a generous handful of fresh young lovage leaves; at least 1 1/2 pt light chicken stock;  1/2 pt buttermilk. Chop the shallots finely. Peel and grate the potatoes. Put both ingredients into a pan. Pour on 1 1/2 pt stock and bring to simmering point, stirring occasionally to stop the potato starch sticking to the bottom of the pan. Stir in 6-7 tablespoons shredded lovage leaves. Cover and simmer gently for 10-15 minutes, stirring once or twice, until the vegetables are perfectly tender. Whizz to a fine green flecked puree. Blend in the buttermilk and season lightly. Thin with more stock to give good consistency, and add extra lovage to taste. Serve well chilled or reheated very gently - on no account boil it, or the buttermilk will curdle. CUCUMBER SOUP WITH PRAWNS AND DILL (serves 4) 1 large cucumber; 6 oz cooked prawns in the shell; a bouquet of dill; 3/4 pt creamy yoghurt; a little sugar and white wine vinegar. Shell the prawns. Simmer the shells with a sprig or two of dill and water to cover in a tightly lidded pan for 25 minutes. Process briefly and sieve carefully to separate the flavoursome liquid from the debris. Fast-boil the shellfish stock until reduced to about  1/4 pt. Peel and seed the cucumber. Put the peel into a processor. Add  1/2 teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon sugar, 1 1/2 teaspoons vinegar and the stock. Whizz to a very finely flecked green puree. Strain the liquid and stir it gradually into the yoghurt to make a smooth pale green cream. Grate the cucumber flesh, chop the prawns and a tablespoon or two of feathery dill leaves. Stir them into the soup and chill for several hours to allow flavours to blend and infuse. Season to taste with salt, pepper, vinegar and dill, and thin the soup, if need be, with a little iced water or stock, just before serving. SPANISH ALMOND SOUP (serves 4-5) 3 oz almond kernels in their brown skins; 1 1/2 oz crustless white bread; 1-2 garlic cloves; 4 tablespoons olive oil; 1 tablespoon sherry vinegar; 1/4 lb grapes, preferably muscat, skinned, halved and de-seeded. Pour boiling water over the almonds and leave for a couple of minutes, then slip off their skins. Crush the garlic with half a teaspoon or more of salt. Then whizz the garlic and nuts in a food processor with a few spoonfuls of water to make a smoothish paste. Add the bread, olive oil and vinegar and whizz again until creamy. Gradually mix in 1-1 1/4 pt iced water. Cover and chill for a few hours to allow flavours to blend and mature. Just before serving, adjust seasoning, thin with more iced water to taste, and stir in the grapes. It is the combination of sweetness and pungency that makes this soup so refreshing.</p>

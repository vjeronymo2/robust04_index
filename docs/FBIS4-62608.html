			<p>BFN     [Text] TALLINN, May 16, BNS - Appointing a new Estonian  delegation to continue the talks with Russia would mean acting  in Russia's interest, Estonian MP Vardo Rumessen said today.    Rumessen was speaking at a protest meeting in front of the  Russian naval headquarters in Tallinn. Weekly pickets are being  held in front of the naval headquarters each Monday, and  activists from the Estonian National Independence Party say  protests will continue until Russian military have left the  country.    "The situation at the talks is very good for Estonia,"  Rumessen said today. "It's Russia's problem that the talks have  run into a deadlock."    Another MP, Enn Tarto, added that bending to pressure from  Russia would mean acknowledging Moscow's policy of the so-called  near abroad.    "Russia wants to make Estonia put up with the situation when  Estonia would depend on Russia," Tarto said.    In Rumessen's words Russia is doing everything to overthrow  Estonia's current government "with the help of her agents here."    Another well-known political activist, vice-president of the  Organization of Unrepresented Nations Linnart Mall, called on  the Russian military to leave Estonia. "Russian soldier, I love  you; please go home and build up your home country," he shouted  in his speech.    More emotional spots were added to today's picketing by the  singing of Gaudeamus men's choir from Tartu.</p>

			<p><P> February 17, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> A MOVER AND A SHAKER ;  </P> <P> RESEDA'S NOMADIC JEFF HALPERN SPECIALIZES IN BASKETBALL REVIVALS  </P> <P> Visitors to the Reseda High gym can't help but notice the Lion. There, larger  than life on the south wall, is a painting of the school's mascot, the Regent.  Stylized with humanlike facial features, it sports a white tank top and holds a  basketball in one paw and a volleyball in the other. It has a look of nobility  to it, one benefitting the king of beasts, but one that seemed out of place  until this year. For in previous seasons, the Reseda boys' basketball team had  distinguished itself as anything but a king.  </P> <P> Consider:  </P> <P> In 1985-86, Reseda was 5-16 and winless (0-12) in Valley 4-A League play.  </P> <P> In 1986-87, the team was 6-13 and 2-10, but with the school's football (2-A  Division) and the girls' basketball (3-A) teams winning City Section titles,  the improvement paled in comparison.  </P> <P> In 1987-88, the Regents sank to new depths, compiling a 2-14 record (1-11 in  league play) while the girls' team was successfully defending its City title  and the boys' soccer and volleyball (3-A) teams were winning their first City  championships.  </P> <P> "Things were pretty bleak," said Coley Kyman, a two-year starter at quarterback  on the football team and at forward-center on the basketball team.  </P> <P> "Before this year, we were used to losing. We went into games expecting to  lose."  </P> <P> Then Jeff Halpern replaced Tim Nakano as coach in September, and things began  to change, albeit slowly at first.  </P> <P> After starting the season with six losses, the Regents (9-10) won nine of their  last 13 games, finished second to North Hollywood with a 7-3 record in the  Mid-Valley League and will play at Wilson in the first round of the City 3-A  playoffs at 7:30 tonight -- their first postseason appearance in four years.  </P> <P> There is no doubt that Reseda's move from the 4-A to the 3-A has been  instrumental in its resurgence, but Halpern also has played a major role in the  Regents' drive to respectability.  </P> <P> After coaching Van Nuys to a 21-3 record during the 1984-85 season and guiding  Birmingham to a 22-3 mark in 1986-87, Halpern came to Reseda with a reputation  as a winner. But he also was known as a nomad, having also lasted only one  season (1987-88) as an assistant at College of the Canyons.  </P> <P> "My wife has told me to at least try and stay at a school more than one year,"  Halpern said. "That's kind of a standing joke around the house. . . . I never  intended to move around as much as I have. It's just turned out that way."  </P> <P> Halpern, 45, said that the Reseda job has been the most challenging and  rewarding -- and at times, frustrating -- of his career.  </P> <P> "We were coming from two ends of the spectrum when I came here," Halpern said.  "The kids were coming from a program that hadn't won in years and I was used to  winning."  </P> <P> After opening the season with an 84-30 stomping at the feet of Taft, followed  by a 70-44 rout by Wilson, Halpern had serious doubts about whether he was up  to the challenge.  </P> <P> "When we lost to Taft by 50 points, I really took it personally," Halpern said.  "I thought, 'What am I doing here?' I blamed it on myself.  </P> <P> "Before, when I saw teams getting killed, I wondered how a coach could let that  happen. But now I know how."  </P> <P> However, neither of those losses caused Halpern as much grief as a 70-59  overtime loss to Birmingham in a consolation-bracket game of the North  Hollywood tournament in December.  </P> <P> Reseda led by eight with two minutes left in regulation only to lose its sixth  consecutive game.  </P> <P> "That one really hurt," Halpern said. "We let that one get away. The kids  weren't used to leading that late in the game and they fell apart. They didn't  know how to win those tight games."  </P> <P> Ironically, the Regents began to turn their season around with a win against  Birmingham three games later. In that game, they came from behind to defeat the  Braves, 43-42, in the third-place game of the Birmingham tournament. They  followed that with a 71-59 victory over Poly in a Valley Pac-8 Conference  opener.  </P> <P> "The victory against Birmingham was a big win," assistant Mohamed Marhaba said.  "Even though they're not a powerhouse, they are a legitimate team."  </P> <P> Marhaba, the sixth man on Halpern's Van Nuys squad that advanced to the 3-A  semifinals, was an assistant under Halpern at Birmingham and gladly came to  Reseda with his mentor.  </P> <P> "It was kind of like a homecoming," Marhaba said. "So when he asked if I wanted  to coach with him, I didn't hesitate."  </P> <P> Establishing good relationships with his players has been a key to Halpern's  success.  </P> <P> "I've always tried to develop a good rapport with the kids," he said. "I'm not  the smartest tactician as far as X's and O's go, but I think I'm able to get  the most out of the kids. I think I'm able to get kids to want to play for me.  </P> <P> "If you sit too far above the kids, when it comes down to it, and you need them  in that really critical situation, they're not going to perform for you."  </P> <P> Anthony Cook, the leader of Halpern's Van Nuys team and a forward at Arizona,  attributed much of his mentor's success to concern for his players' welfare.  </P> <P> "You can just tell that he really relates to all his players and cares about  what happens to them, both on and off the court," said Cook, an All-Pacific 10  Conference selection last year. "And that makes you want to play for him. It  makes a big difference to you as a player knowing that your coach cares about  you."  </P> <P> Cook said that Halpern's friendship with the Van Nuys players helped transform  the Wolves into a better team. "We did things off the court together," Cook  said. "We had team dinners at various players' houses and we went to movies and  sometimes to other games together. We were a very close-knit team and it showed  in the way we played."  </P> <P> Halpern has a special fondness for that team, which was upset by San Pedro,  77-70, in the semifinals.  </P> <P> Despite the loss, Halpern had established himself as a legitimate varsity coach  after 10 years at the B and C level at Grant, his alma mater. But any  satisfaction was diminished quickly when Van Nuys released him from his  position at the end of the school year because of budget cuts. "I was  devastated. I felt like I had made a name for myself and it was yanked out from  under me," Halpern said.  </P> <P> Halpern began teaching at Birmingham in the fall of 1985, after his release,  but did not coach basketball until a year later when Jim O'Hara retired. He  immediately guided the Braves (12-11 a year earlier) to the Northwest Valley  League title and the City 3-A final, which they lost to Granada Hills.  </P> <P> Though his job was secure, Halpern took the position at Canyons last season  while still teaching five classes at Birmingham.  </P> <P> "I wanted to get a taste of coaching at the collegiate level," Halpern said. "I  thought it'd be challenging, so I took the job when the opportunity presented  itself."  </P> <P> Halpern intended to return to Canyons this season, but when Birmingham told him  that he would have to teach six classes instead of five -- thus interfering  with his duties at the Valencia campus -- he took the job at Reseda.  </P> <P> "I learned a lot at COC," Halpern said. "But I also learned that I need to be a  head coach. After having your own program for so many years, even if it's at  the B and C level, it's different working for someone else. You don't have as  much input and the kids look at you in a different way, without as much  respect."  </P> <P> And respect is important to Halpern. "I expect what I give," he said. "If the  kids don't give back to me as much as I give out, then I get upset."  </P> <P> Apparently, there's been little upsetting about his stay at Reseda. But will  Halpern stick around?  </P> <P> "I feel like I've found a home at Reseda. I feel comfortable there," he said.  "But if a head coaching position opened up at the community college level, I do  believe I could hold my own."  </P></p>

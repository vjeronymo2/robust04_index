			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The change in duty hours coupled with adequate rest could decrease absenteeism and improve health. However, the information needed to quantify this, is not currently available. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the FAA is concerned with passenger and crewmember safety, and is sensitive to crewmember health and welfare. The FAA recognizes that employee health could improve if employees get more rest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Costs <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Cost estimates contained in this summary are based on 1993 dollars and are discounted at an annual effective rate of 7 percent. The FAA estimates that the cost to the air carrier industry of establishing flight attendant duty period limitations and rest requirements will be $42.7 million over a 15-year period. The FAA expects that operators would incur costs in the areas of recordkeeping and additional staffing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Cost estimates for supplemental air carriers and scheduled major, national, and regional/commuter operators are separated. The FAA estimates that the nondiscounted cost for all supplemental air carriers for the first year will be approximately $2.5 million, and the annual nondiscounted cost for all supplemental carriers would be approximately $2.23 million. The FAA estimates that the total discounted costs for supplemental air carriers over 15 years will be approximately $20.8 million. The FAA estimates that the first-year nondiscounted cost for scheduled major, national, and regional/commuter operators will be approximately $2.9 million, and the annual nondiscounted cost for these operators would be approximately $1.2 million. The FAA estimates that the total discounted costs for scheduled major, national, and regional/commuter over 15 years will be approximately $21.9 million. Therefore, over 15 years, the discounted cost for the air carrier industry will be $42.7 million. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The above cost estimate is based on the assumption that air carriers must augment their flight attendant crews. In some situations, augmentation under the flight attendant rule requirements may be avoided if an air carrier adopts and applies to flight attendants, by option, the international, supplemental carrier pilot rules covering flight and duty period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Twenty-Four Consecutive-Hour Rest Period During any Seven Consecutive Days <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Southwest Airlines stated that the requirement for 24 consecutive hours of rest during any 7 consecutive days would make it necessary for the air carrier with which the commenter is affiliated to hire about 100 additional flight attendants at a first-year cost of $710,000 and a subsequent annual cost of $600,000. A commenter representing Transport Workers Union of America on behalf of Southwest Airlines flight attendants indicated that the proposed rule, if adopted, would create a financial burden for flight attendants and their employers and would result in an average annual loss of $11,063 in extra income for each flight attendant. This loss, projected for 2,200 flight attendants for 1 year, would total $24 million in lost income. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Laura Ashley sells Dollars 27m US stake The US subsidiary of Laura Ashley, the clothing and furnishings retailer and manufacturer, is selling its 44.4 per cent holding in Revman Industries, the North American bed linen designer, manufacturer and wholesaler. Laura Ashley will receive Dollars 27.1m (Pounds 18m), comprising Dollars 19m in cash plus the redemption at par value of preferred stock which amounts to Dollars 8.05m cash. The directors stated that the company would also receive accrued dividends on the preferred stock. The purchaser is Aeon Group, the Japanese store concern, which holds 15 per cent of Laura Ashley and is its joint venture partner in Japan. Mr Andrew Higginson, Laura Ashley's finance director, said the disposal was part of the group's policy of returning to its core business. The proceeds could help accelerate capital expenditure plans, including doubling the number of European stores to 120. The improvement at the lossmaking US subsidiary was continuing, he said. Revman would continue to sell Laura Ashley bed linen, the best selling brand in the US, under licence. Last year Laura Ashley's share of Revman's profits came to more than Pounds 2m.</p>

Human studies in which the induction or enhancement of an immune response to a vector-encoded microbial immunogen is the major goal, such an immune response has been demonstrated in model systems, and the persistence of the vector-encoded immunogen is not expected, are not covered under Sections III&hyph;A&hyph;2, III&hyph;B&hyph;2, or III&hyph;B&hyph;3. Such studies may be initiated without RAC review and NIH approval if approved by another Federal agency.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The following new footnote, V&hyph;W is added to Section V:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section V&hyph;W. In accordance with accepted scientific and regulatory practices of the discipline of plant pathology, an exotic plant pathogen (e.g., virus, bacteria, or fungus) is one that is unknown to occur within the U.S. (see Section V&hyph;R). Determination of whether a pathogen has a potential for serious detrimental impact on managed (agricultural, forest, grassland) or natural ecosystems should be made by the Principal Investigator and the Institutional Biosafety Committee, in consultation with scientists knowledgeable of plant diseases, crops, and ecosystems in the geographic area of the research. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> F.

For large scale (over 10 liters) research or production, Appendix K supersedes Appendix G. Appendix K defines Good Large Scale Practice through Biosafety Level 3_Large Scale. For certain work with plants, Appendix P supersedes Appendix G. Appendix P defines Biosafety Levels 1 through 4_Plants. For certain work with animals, Appendix Q supersedes Appendix G. Appendix Q defines Biosafety Levels 1 through 4_Animals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / International Company News: Tetra Laval sells unit TETRA LAVAL, the Swedish food packaging and equipment group, has made its first big disposal since the takeover of Alfa-Laval in 1991. It has sold German-based Bran &amp; Luebbe in a DM210m (Dollars 130m) leveraged buy-out, writes Andrew Baxter. CWB Capital Partners, a London-based acquisition fund, is buying B&amp;L, one of the world's leading suppliers of dosing pumps, industrial analysers, and electronics for industrial weighing and process automation. The deal is believed to be the largest leveraged buy-out in Germany in three years. Bank financing is being provided by Dresdner Bank, Deutsche Bank and Citibank. Rhein Donau Capital Partners, a fund managed by Goldman Sachs, has taken a substantial minority stake in the transaction, and Hancock International Private Equity Partners has also made a minority investment.</p>

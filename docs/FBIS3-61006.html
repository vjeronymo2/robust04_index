			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Lieutenant-Colonel A. Bekhter and Candidate of </F> Technical Sciences Colonel (Retired) V. Lavrik under the rubric  "IAS: Solution to a Problem Proposed": "Loss of Service Life  Could Be Avoided"]    [Text] It is well known that the utilization of  aircraft equipment for its intended purposes is limited by its  service lives (in hours, landings, actuation cycles and the  like) and the stipulated overall time of service. The aggregate  of these values describes the operability reserves of the  hardware and its service-life potential. It may be  realized--that is, turned into flying time--at a fully defined  rate of operation, which is defined by the ratio of the service  life and its corresponding time of service. Losses are  inevitable at a lower rate of operation. This potential, taking  into account hardware that is in storage, makes it possible to  have, for instance, yearly flying time of 300--400 hours per  aircraft in frontal aviation. The aircraft often actually fly  about 100 hours, and the pilots 50--70, in a year. A small  number of aircraft engines and assemblies moreover come in for  repairs without a fully utilized service life, owing to the  expiration of the overall time of service. What is the reason  for that? First and foremost, of course, the decreased  appropriations for defense and shortages of engineering and  technical personnel, fuel and spare parts. But also the  complexity, increased many times over under these conditions, of  the tasks of command and control, requiring a systematic  assessment of the factors affecting the rate of operation. The  discussion here concerns new approaches to performing that  assessment, making it possible to increase the effectiveness of  the utilization of service-life potential.    It seems at first glance that if the overall flying time of  an aircraft is counted in hours, then there should be no  fundamental difference between flying time and calendar time of  service, and the reliability of the hardware could be assessed  using either of those values. But that is not so. The extent of  corrosion, aging and biological damage to the airframe depends  on the calendar duration of operation, while overall flying time  characterizes the operation of the hardware and its wear and  tear and fatigue damage accordingly. A criterion that takes into  account both accrued run time and time of service is thus  necessary for a complete accounting of the whole spectrum of  demands in effect. Since the aviation hardware is employed with  interruptions, the extent of realization of the service life  within the limits of a certain period of calendar time can be  described by the average daily rate of its expenditure.    The time of service (T) of an aircraft may be represented as  the sum of the times of pre-operational storage  (T&lt;inf&gt; st&lt;/inf&gt; ) and actual operation. Expressing the latter in  terms of service life as measured in accrued time in hours  (&tgr;)  and the average daily rate of its expenditure (&eegr;), we have:    T = T&lt;inf&gt; st&lt;/inf&gt;  + (&tgr;/365&eegr;), years (1)    We will put equation (1) into a form convenient for  analysis:    &tgr; = (T - T&lt;inf&gt; st&lt;/inf&gt; )365&eegr;, hours (2)    Whence it can be seen that an increased rate of service-life  expenditure is necessary to provide one and the same accrued  operating time when the storage time is increased. Two causes of  losses are thus possible--owing to a low rate of expenditure of  the service life, and owing to increased duration of  pre-operational storage.    For example, where &tgr; = 2,000 hours, T = 10 years,  &eegr; = 0.3  hours/day and T&lt;inf&gt; st&lt;/inf&gt;  = 2 years, the service-life losses  are 56 percent. They decrease with increases in the rate of  operation, and rise with increases in the duration of  pre-operational storage. If we take the storage period in the  previous example as being equal to five years, the losses exceed  70 percent.    The losses increase, at an unchanged rate of operation, with  increases in the storage time. They can be reduced by extending  the time of service, but at low values for &eegr; an increase in  the time of service provides an insignificant gain. Where T is  increased to three years and &eegr; has the same value (0.3  hours/day), the losses decrease from 56 to 40 percent. A  lengthening of the time of service can therefore be justified  only with a sufficiently high average daily rate of expenditure  of the service life.    How can losses of service life be avoided? An  answer may be obtained by solving equation (2) for &eegr;. If a  guaranteed running time &tgr;&lt;inf&gt; g&lt;/inf&gt;  for an aircraft engine  is 2,000 hours, for example, and it was stored for three years  before the start of operation (before expiration of the  effective term of storage) with a guaranteed time of service  T&lt;inf&gt; g&lt;/inf&gt;  of 10 years, the required average rate of  expenditure of the service life should not be less than 0.78  hours/day; that is, the annual accrued running time should not  be less than 285 hours.    We would note that this methodological approach could also  be  extended to the case of the storage of items in a non-mothballed  state on board an airframe, with their occasional testing under  standard servicing procedures. If the item is a removable one  and the testing is performed in the interests of ensuring its  readiness for utilization, however, it must be taken into  account that some of the service life will have been expended  even before the start of operation.    We will consider a more general case. We will assess the  rate  of expenditure of the service life of an airframe within the  context of a whole operational cycle, with a regard for the  hardware being in various states (use for its intended purpose,  maintenance and restoration of operability, waiting in good  working order, storage). The duration in each of them describes  one of the operating properties of the airframe (failure-free  operation, maintainability, operational feasibility, longevity)  with a regard for the level of perfection of maintenance (TO)  and logistical support (MTO), while the rate of expenditure of  the service life reflects the manifestation of those properties  as a whole. This value at the same time acts as an indication of  the productivity of the airframe (in the form of flying time,  for example, or the number of aircraft-sorties per unit time).    The rate of expenditure of service life (K) in such a  representation serves as a criterion of the operational  technical quality:    K = (T&lt;inf&gt; t&lt;/inf&gt; /(T&lt;inf&gt; t&lt;/inf&gt;  + t&lt;inf&gt; r&lt;/inf&gt;  +  t&lt;inf&gt; pl&lt;/inf&gt;  + t&lt;inf&gt; wm&lt;/inf&gt;  +  t&lt;inf&gt; wls&lt;/inf&gt; ))K&lt;inf&gt; year&lt;/inf&gt; , (3)    where T&lt;inf&gt; t&lt;/inf&gt; /(T&lt;inf&gt; t&lt;/inf&gt; , t&lt;inf&gt; r&lt;/inf&gt; ,  t&lt;inf&gt; pl&lt;/inf&gt; , t&lt;inf&gt; wm&lt;/inf&gt;  and t&lt;inf&gt; wls&lt;/inf&gt;  are the  cumulative amounts of time the airframe is in flight, undergoing  restoration of an operable state, planned maintenance, waiting  for maintenance (airframe idle time for organizational reasons)  and waiting for logistical support (idle time waiting for spare  parts) over the span of a certain operating period, and  K&lt;inf&gt; year&lt;/inf&gt;  is the work time utilization factor.    The value T&lt;inf&gt; t&lt;/inf&gt;  is a measure of the usefulness of an  airframe, and describes its failure-free operation. The duration  of restoration (t&lt;inf&gt; r&lt;/inf&gt; ) and planned maintenance  (t&lt;inf&gt; pl&lt;/inf&gt; ) reflects the expenditures of time to find and  eliminate defects and maintain operability, and describes the  maintainability of the airframe. One may judge the level of  perfection of the TO and MTO by the values t&lt;inf&gt; wm&lt;/inf&gt;  and  t&lt;inf&gt; wls&lt;/inf&gt;  respectively. The work time utilization factor  K&lt;inf&gt; year&lt;/inf&gt;  shows what share of the year's time is  relegated to the operation of the airframe, and what share to  idle time during non-working time. K&lt;inf&gt; year&lt;/inf&gt;  = 1, for  example, with around-the-clock work on the hardware.  K&lt;inf&gt; year&lt;/inf&gt; = 0.237 with an eight-hour work day and a  42-hour work week (yearly work time reserve equal to 2,080  hours).    The following group of summary indicators, consistently  revealing the effects of the characteristics described on the  rate of service life expenditure, can be singled out from  expression (3).    1. Where t&lt;inf&gt; pl&lt;/inf&gt;  = t&lt;inf&gt; wm&lt;/inf&gt;  = t&lt;inf&gt; wls&lt;/inf&gt;  = 0 and K&lt;inf&gt; year&lt;/inf&gt;  = 1, we obtain an indicator of  reliability that takes into account the joint manifestation of  the absence of failures and maintainability (K1).    2. Where t&lt;inf&gt; wm&lt;/inf&gt;  = t&lt;inf&gt; pl&lt;/inf&gt;  = 0 and  K&lt;inf&gt; year&lt;/inf&gt;  = 1, we calculate the summary indicator of  reliability and operational feasibility (K2). It reflects the  likelihood of the airframe being in an operable state under  conditions of idle time only for planned and unplanned  maintenance.    3. Where t&lt;inf&gt; pl&lt;/inf&gt;  = 0 and K&lt;inf&gt; year&lt;/inf&gt;  = 1, we  obtain an indicator that also takes into account the effects of  the characteristics of the actual system of maintenance on the  operational technical quality of the airframe (K3).    4. Where K&lt;inf&gt; year&lt;/inf&gt;  = 1 and all values in the  denominator are not equal to zero, the effects of the system of  logistical support are taken into account (K4).    5. Under the latter (paragraph 4) conditions but where  K&lt;inf&gt; year&lt;/inf&gt;  &lt; 1, we also obtain the idle time of the  airframe in non-work time (K5).    The indicators K1--K5 thus make it possible to calculate the  rate of expenditure of airframe service life with a regard for  its operational level, organization of operations on the  equipment and the quality of the functioning of the system to  supply spare parts. The unit of these indicators is an hour of  flying time per hour of operation. By multiplying the value of K  by the duration of the year in hours, we obtain the available  yearly flying time of the airframe (T&lt;inf&gt; a&lt;/inf&gt; ). We would  note that the required value of the yearly flying time  (T&lt;inf&gt; req&lt;/inf&gt; ) for the complete consumption of the service  life (R&lt;inf&gt; f&lt;/inf&gt; ) is equal to the ratio of that service life  to the corresponding time of service.    The methodological approach set forth provides an  opportunity  to move to a determination of the value of the service-life  potential of an airframe that could be realized over a  designated span of time of service--that is, to an assessment of  the attained rate of expenditure of the service-life potential  of an airframe and its juxtaposition with the required one. That  will now make it possible to predict the using up of the  service-life potential and, where necessary, to make the  corresponding corrections in the organization of IAS [aviation  engineering service] operations based on a regard for the  effects of the determining factors.    We will consider an example of such an assessment.

The F-15 has the higher quality level when the  lesser idle time waiting for spare parts (K4) and increased  value for K&lt;inf&gt; year&lt;/inf&gt;  (K5) are taken into account. The  attained value for K5 allows the Su-27 to serve out its service  life without losses (it has T&lt;inf&gt; a&lt;/inf&gt;  &gt; T&lt;inf&gt; req&lt;/inf&gt; ).  It is easy to estimate that the losses of service life for the  foreign model are about five percent, despite the fact that it  is operated more intensively than the domestic one  (K&lt;inf&gt; year&lt;/inf&gt;  = 0.31).    The necessary reduction in idle time of the airframe for TO  can be determined for the complete using up of the service life,  and the corresponding measures developed with a regard for  expenditures, according to the data cited.    An analysis of operational suitability based on an  assessment  of the rate of expenditure of the service-life potential when  putting new airframes into service is of particular  significance. It is known that the technology for servicing and  the organization of technical operations depends on the design  features of the airframe as determined by its dedicated purpose  and the quality of design engineering and production. By  possessing data on the airframe and varying the requirements and  their limitations, it is possible to substantiate the most  acceptable variation, from the time standpoint, for technical  operation and logistical support with a regard for the shortage  of material and human resources.    We turn our attention to another exceedingly important  sphere  of the possible application of such an analysis--the  certification of product and production processes. Any product  is valued markedly higher if it and the processes of its  manufacture have a certificate of conformity--a document  indicating that the given product and production are in  accordance with certain requirements (standard, for instance).    While the flight quality of an airframe is evaluated for  conformity to the Uniform Standards of Airworthiness, the  assessment of the level of operational excellence requires its  comparison with competitive models of aircraft in the given  class. The proposed approach provides that opportunity when  determining the competitiveness of an airframe and  substantiating its price for both the domestic and foreign  markets.    We have thus demonstrated that a sufficiently correct  solution can be obtained for a whole series of tasks--such as  determining the pattern of time expenditures for operations,  predicting losses of service life and developing measures aimed  at averting those losses and assessing the operational technical  quality of airframes in service and under development with a  regard for organizational, technical, economic and other factors  and the certification of aviation hardware--on the basis of an  analysis of the rate of expenditure of the service life of  aviation hardware (service-life potential). The use of the  results obtained makes it possible to increase the economic  efficiency of aircraft operations virtually without any  additional material expenditures, which is particularly  important at the current time.  Footnote    1. The initial data for the Su-27 were obtained according to  the results of the initial operating period of that fighter in a  military unit. The indicators for the F-15 aircraft describe it  with a regard for various periods of operations and base areas.    COPYRIGHT: "Aviatsiya i kosmonavtika", 1993.</p>

			<p><P> July 9, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MINTEY TRAVELS WIRE TO WIRE FOR SAUGUS WIN  </P> <P> Pat Mintey Jr. of Quartz Hill is not even listed among the top 15 drivers in  the Saugus Speedway Sportsman division points standings.  </P> <P> Ostensibly, he'd be listed 16th, but the track's program includes only the top  15 in the standings.  </P> <P> But Mintey, a track rookie, was at the top of the list of competitors at the  beginning and end of Saturday night's 40-lap Sportsman division main event  before a crowd of 3,486.  </P> <P> Mintey led from pole to checkered flag to claim his second main-event win of  the season in a crash-free race that featured only one change in position among  the top four drivers.  </P> <P> "I knew (Will) Harper was back there the whole time. He always is," Mintey  said. "He's a clean driver; he only bumped me once. But I knew that I had what  it takes to beat him."  </P> <P> Harper, of Tarzana, the division's points leader, and Dave Phipps of Simi  Valley, the two-time defending track champion, finished second and third,  respectively.  </P> <P> Keith Spangler of Northridge, who started third ahead of Phipps, finished  fourth after Phipps moved ahead of him on Lap 6.  </P> <P> The evening also proved to be a memorable one for Eric Foster of North  Hollywood, who won his first Street Stock division oval main event of his  four-year career and his second consecutive main event after posting a figure 8  win two weeks ago.  </P> <P> "This one is very special," Foster said.  </P> <P> Especially considering the disappointment the 29-year-old has suffered.  </P> <P> In the 25-lap oval main event on June 24, Foster held the lead with three laps  to go and was ready to claim his first oval win. But a flat front tire forced  him to pull out and he finished at the back of the pack.  </P> <P> On Saturday, Foster's blue and white Chevelle sustained a broken clutch during  qualification, making it necessary for Foster's wife Jennifer to speed through  town in search of a clutch plate minutes before the start of the main event.  </P> <P> "I went 80 m.p.h. down Soledad Canyon Road, going in and out of traffic," she  said. "I went into an auto parts store and said, 'Please help us!' "  </P> <P> She returned with the part just in time for her husband to make a quick repair  and hit the track.  </P> <P> "We didn't get to set it or anything," Foster said. "We just put it in and took  off."  </P> <P> Foster took off past pole sitter Sue Pittinato of West Hills on the opening lap  and breezed unmolested to the checkered flag.  </P> <P> Jim Marlewski of Simi Valley finished a distant second with Craig Rayburn of  Simi Valley third and Pittinato fourth.  </P> <P> Dennis Andrews of Redlands won his third of four Mini Stock main events this  season, passing Tim Mitchell of La Crescenta on the 19th lap of the 25-lap  race.  </P> <P> In other races, John Lindley Jr. of Newhall won the 12-lap Street Stock oval  semi-main event to lead four drivers who advanced to the main event. Greg  Benner of Whittier, Arnold Fagan of Palmdale and Dale Petty of Agoura also  advanced.  </P> <P> Eight-lap Sportsman heat race winners included Larry Krieger of Reseda, Keith  Spangler of Northridge and Arlyn Olson of Chatsworth.  </P> <P> Eight-lap Street Stock oval heat race winners included Lindley, Pittinato and  Rayburn.  </P> <P> Russ Beckers of Sepulveda won the eight-lap Street Stock figure 8 heat race  ahead of Steve Nickolai of Simi Valley and Rayburn.  </P> <P> Eight-lap Mini Stock heat race winners included Mitchell and Pat Dennison of  Van Nuys.  </P> <P> Trophy dash winners included John Watkinson III of Canyon Country (Sportsman),  Rip Michaels of Arleta (Street Stock oval) and Nickolai (Street Stock figure  8).  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 9, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> EL CAMINO REAL PROVES RANKING WELL DESERVED  </P> <P> When one ponders El Camino Real High's 18-1 dismantling of host Taft in a West  Valley League opener Thursday, several things leap to the fore.  </P> <P> There was the razor-sharp pitching of senior right-hander Patrick Treend (1-0),  who scattered just three hits -- two of them infield singles -- and allowed no  earned runs in going the distance.  </P> <P> There were the pyrotechnics provided by senior first baseman Ryan McGuire and  senior catcher Bobby Kim, each of whom rapped out three hits, a home run and  drove in four runs.  </P> <P> And there was sparkling defense, as El Camino Real third baseman Greg Lederman  showed range and arm strength, McGuire dropped into the splits digging out  throws and right fielder Chris Castillo sprawled across the outfield grass to  make a diving catch.  </P> <P> In sum, a solid all-around performance.  </P> <P> "We did play awfully well today," McGuire conceded. "We'd be hard-pressed to  play this well all year."  </P> <P> It wasn't bad for an opener, though.  </P> <P> But these guys aren't robots. In fact, they could be heard 'fessing up to  having pregame nerves. After all, the unanimous pick for No. 1 in the Valley,  the Conquistadores had yet to play a game.  </P> <P> "Today, actually, I was really nervous," Treend said. "Coming in here 0-0, most  of us were a little worried about how it might come out."  </P> <P> Not to worry. After McGuire and Jason Cohen knocked in runs in the top of the  first for a 2-0 lead, El Camino Real scored four more in the third on a two-run  McGuire homer to right and a single by Kim that chased loser Cory Jacobson.  </P> <P> Seven more runs followed in the fourth as 12 Conquistadores batted and the roof  caved in for Taft (3-1, 0-1).  </P> <P> For El Camino Real, center-fielder Jeff Marks had three hits, including a  double, and drove in two runs.  </P> <P> Treend struck out seven and walked just one.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Chit Estrella] </F>   [Text] Resumption of the peace efforts with the National  Democratic Front (NDF) remained uncertain as the leftist  organization said it will not engage in talks with the  government unless the latter removes the "obstructions" in the  negotiations.    In a statement, Luis Jalandoni, NDF vice chairman for  international affairs, said the obstructions include the  issuance of Executive Order No. (EO) 125 which sets the  Philippine Constitution as the framework for the peace talks,  the alleged coddling by the government of persons who broke away  from the leadership of the Communist Party of the Philippines,  the continued detention of political prisoners, and lately, the  government's inaction on the plight of 10,000 victims of human  rights violations seeking monetary claims on the Marcos estate.    Jalandoni also criticized President Ramos' "lack of  sincerity  in seeking serious peace talks" when the latter declared the  impending collapse of the New People's Army during the  graduation rites of the Philippine Military Academy.    "His predecessors, Mr. Marcos and Mrs. Aquino, had made  similar pronouncements. Now Mr. Ramos indulges in the same  wishful thinking. The revolutionary movement is strong and  fighting for the just cause of the people throughout the  country," the NDF official said.    The organization blamed the government for the delay in the  talks, saying, "It is the unilateral decisions of the Ramos  regime in contravention of the Joint Declaration signed in The  Hague on 1 September 1992 that have caused the delay in the  talks between the NDF and the GRP Government of the Republic of  the Philippines."    The joint declaration said the two sides would not set any  condition for the talks. The NDF considers the issuance of EO  125 as a condition set by the Philippine Government.    "The NDF stands by its commitment to seek a just, enduring,  and liberating peace. But it will never agree to the GRP  Constitution as the framework of the talks and it remains firm  in calling for the removal of the obstructions placed by the  Ramos regime," Jalandoni said.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Nicu Popescu] </F>   [Text] The visit by U.S. General George Joulwan, supreme  commander of allied forces in Europe, to Bucharest at the  invitation of Romanian National Defense Minister Gheorghe Tinca  ended at noon today. Before leaving Romania for Albania, Tinca  and Joulwan met with journalists in the Byzantine Hall of the  National Military Circle and held a news conference.    In his opening statement Tinca extended heartfelt thanks to  the U.S. general for the talks and said that the first visit by  the supreme commander of allied forces in Europe beyond the  borders of the NATO member states, that is, to Romania, has  clear political significance. It is considered recognition of  our country's geostrategic importance in this region.    The Romanian minister mentioned that during the talks the  sides had discussed the political and economic situation in  Romania and stressed the irreversible nature of options for a  democratic system, pluralism, and market economy.    During the talks the guests were told about the importance  of  foreign financial support this year for relaunching Romania's  economy. Likewise, the Romanian side described plans to  reorganize the army, taking into account its new status as a  fundamental institution of the rule-of-law state. Tinca said  that an important topic of the talks was the Partnership for  Peace [PFP] program. He stressed that our county views this  formula as an element ensuring the consolidation of stability in  this area. The Romanian minister noted that the sides had  assessed the intention of Russia and other countries to sign the  PFP framework document as a positive element and a new element  in the actions to strengthen stability in Europe.    Tinca said that the guests were informed about the current  stage in preparing the document of Romania's presentation, which  will be approved very soon by Romania's Supreme Defense Council  and then sent to Brussels. The defense minister stressed that  General Joulwan views the Romanian Army's orientation toward  developing relations with the armies of its neighboring  countries as an element that helps to increase confidence and  good neighborliness. The defense minister reported that the  U.S. general had visited the Romanian peacekeeping battalion,  which, together with the other two battalions that are to be  established soon, will be trained in accordance with a joint  concept for peacekeeping operations organized by NATO.    In his statement, Gen. Joulwan again stressed that he had  chosen Romania for his first visit outside NATO first of all  because our country had showed its willingness to join the PFP  and because of its important position in Europe. The general  mentioned that during his talks with Romania's president, prime  minister, defense minister, and chief of general staff he had  noted a consistent team that is concerned with the PFP,  achieving peace through freedom, and the commitment to continue  this partnership.    Gen. Joulwan also noted that in leaving Romania he was  taking  with him a clear impression of Romania's commitment to respect  this program.    In the second part of the news conference, Gen. Joulwan said  in answering reporters' questions that in the PFP, treatment  will be equal for all partner states, including the Russian  Federation when it signs the document, and he expressed the hope  that this would take place this month. Gen. Joulwan mentioned  that the decision to participate in the PFP is a matter for each  sovereign nation. Regarding specific ways to implement the  Partnership program, an issue raised during the talks in  Bucharest by the NATO dignitary, speaking on behalf of NATO, he  noted that one must first see our country's document of  presentation, which will include Romania's strategy or desire to  carry out a number of military activities, and then a working  plan will be established to include all requirements.    Tinca wished to stress that the PFP makes an indirect  contribution to prosperity. Since the PFP is directed toward  everyone equally, it will help preserve stability and will  strengthen the sense of security. Thus Central and East  European countries will be able to concentrate on development  and the continuation of reform.    The climate of stability, the Romanian national defense  minister added, will have positive effects also regarding  foreign investors.    In connection with the tragedy in the former Yugoslavia,  Gen.  Joulwan said that this worries everybody and the only solution  is diplomatic and political and not military. He said that all  efforts must be in the direction of reaching solutions solely  through negotiations.</p>

			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / Personal View: A blueprint to reshape government Vice-president Al Gore's initiative to reinvent US government has been criticised for being tame. This is unfair. His proposals to decentralise, cut red tape, empower and expose bureaucrats to competitive tendering are clearly desirable, if scarcely revolutionary. The risk is that the reformist thrust will before long lose its momentum, and the old bureaucratic habits reappear. The problem is global. Just as the Gore initiative revisits ground trodden by President Reagan's deregulators, so Britain's prime minister John Major, when he presents deregulation as a main theme of this week's Conservative party conference, will be revitalising Lord Young's deregulatory thrust of the 1980s. The propensity of bureaucratic empires to regroup and expand is at the centre of the public choice school of economic analysis pioneered by US economists James Buchanan and Gordon Tulloch. Yet their followers have failed to devise a new model of government that would curb the growth of bureaux, build in opportunities to choose between potential providers of government services, and define more tightly what politicians and public want officials to deliver. In one relatively small country the tribulations of the 1980s led to the invention of a means to achieve these objectives. New Zealand is well known for its liberalising 'Rogernomics', pioneered by finance minister Roger Douglas, which helped turn round its economy in the 1980s. In the 1990s it may become even better known for a sophisticated redesign of its entire machinery of government. In the new framework, a policy is no longer a vague notion, linked loosely, if at all, to what departments actually do, frequently at odds with available resources and disconnected from desired goals. Every department now has a weighty, costed, line-by line 'purchase agreement' with its minister. And not only does the minister explicitly purchase policies from the department, but the former departmental permanent heads, now re-named chief executives and on fixed-term contracts, are personally accountable for departmental delivery. The secret of the New Zealand formula is that it sharpens and clarifies at every stage what government thinks. First and foremost, it puts new pressures on ministers to clarify their own objectives - the desired 'outcomes' of their work - clear them with colleagues, and vote proper resources and establish political priorities. Not all ministers find that this comes naturally, but the obligation to sign a contract with their department specifying its tasks for the year ahead concentrates the mind. What seemed like a rod for the bureaucracy has become a healthy discipline for politicians, and a disincentive to seat-of-the-pants short-termism. The ministerial purchase contract is incorporated within a performance agreement with each departmental chief executive. It sets out the key areas for which the chief executive is accountable. Chief executives have autonomy to run their departments and hire and fire, as never before. The quid pro quo is tough reporting requirements. The model contract supplied by the system's watchdog, the State Services Commission, runs as follows: 'As chief executive I will provide a written report to the minister against all parts of this agreement in writing as soon as possible after the end of each quarter. This report will include an executive summary which identifies any significant variations of actual against target performance, what specific action will be taken to address underperformance, and set out in a more detailed report what was expected and what was delivered.' Not every chief executive is thrilled by the new regime. It provides, after all, just the sort of targets, monitoring techniques, incentives and performance measures that prevail in the business world but are anathema to many public servants worldwide. But politicians of all stripes are beginning to recognise the system's potential to squeeze better value for every taxpayer dollar. Introduced by Labour, the system has been reviewed, endorsed and developed by the National party. Invented by high-powered Treasury officials in response to New Zealand's crisis of the 1980s, it is more than a patch-up, providing a new intellectual understanding of government as a series of defined and enforceable contracts. For Al Gore, John Major and politicians across the world struggling to squeeze more performance out of creaking governmental systems designed in the last century, New Zealand's redesign points the way.

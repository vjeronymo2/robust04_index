			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Names of Firms: Aptos Shell,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Date of Filing: July 20, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Case Numbers: LEF&hyph;0092,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On July 20, 1993, the Economic Regulatory Administration (ERA) of the Department of Energy (DOE) filed a Petition requesting that the Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) formulate and implement Subpart V special refund proceedings. Under the procedural regulations of the DOE, special refund proceedings may be implemented to refund monies to persons injured by violations of the DOE petroleum price regulations, provided DOE is unable to readily identify such persons or to ascertain the amount of any refund. 10 CFR 205.280. We have considered ERA's request to formulate refund procedures for the disbursement of monies remitted by Aptos Shell (Aptos) and 4 other firms pursuant to a Remedial Order (hereafter, the Order) issued by OHA on December 14, 1981, and have determined that such procedures are appropriate. Each firm's name, case number and amount of money remitted to remedy its pricing violations has been set out in the Appendix immediately following this Decision. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the terms of the Order, a total of $21,764.57 has been remitted to DOE to remedy pricing violations which occurred during the relevant audit periods. These funds are being held in an escrow account established with the United States Treasury pending a determination of their proper distribution.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Memorandum from George B. Breznay, Director OHA, to James T. Campbell, Comptroller, ``Transferring Funds to Escrow Account,'' August 30, 1993. This Decision sets forth OHA's plan to distribute those funds. The specific application requirements appear in Section III of this Decision. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> I. Jurisdiction and Authority <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The general guidelines that govern OHA's ability to formulate and implement a plan to distribute refunds are set forth at 10 CFR Part 205, Subpart V. These procedures apply in situations where the DOE cannot readily identify the persons who were injured as a result of actual or alleged violations of the regulations or ascertain the amount of the refund each person should receive. For a more detailed discussion of Subpart V and the authority of the OHA to fashion procedures to distribute refunds, see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Office of Enforcement, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  9 DOE &para;82,508 (1981) and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Office of Enforcement, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  8 DOE &para;82,597 (1981). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> II. Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The facts alleged in the Order were undisputed. Each Remedial Order firm was a ``retailer'' of motor gasoline as that term has been defined at 10 CFR 212.31 and was therefore subject to the provisions of 10 CFR Part 210 and 10 CFR Part 212, Subpart F. The Order states that during the relevant audit period, they each charged prices higher than those permitted by 10 CFR 212.93(a)(2); levied a cents-per-gallon fee for services associated with the sale of motor gasoline in violation of 10 CFR 210.62(d)(1) and refused to make their records available for inspection in violation of 10 CFR 210.92(b). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The firms were ordered to reduce their prices for motor gasoline by specified amounts until a sufficient volume of gasoline had been sold at the reduced prices to remedy the violations. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  After decontrol, DOE moved to require direct monetary restitution to the Treasury instead.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See Sunset Boulevard Car Wash, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  20 FERC &para;62,319 at 63,537 (1982). Under the terms of DOE's motion, the firms were required to disgorge and remit to the Treasury any violation amounts and the profits they had acquired as a result of their violations of the aforementioned provisions of the pricing regulations. The firms objected to DOE's motion which has since been affirmed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) in a Decision issued on August 13, 1982.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Id. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  FERC issued a final Order adopting its Proposed Order on September 29, 1982. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Order imposed no sanctions upon the firms for failing to provide records pursuant to 10 CFR 210.92(b).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Remedial Order at 1 and 7. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On April 28, 1994, we issued a Proposed Decision and Order (PDO) establishing tentative procedures to distribute the funds that each firm remitted to DOE pursuant to the modified Order. We proposed implementing a two stage refund proceeding and we stated that applicants who purchased gasoline from any one of the retailers identified in the Appendix to the PDO would be provided an opportunity to submit refund applications in the first stage. In the event funds remained after all first stage claims had been considered, we stated that the remaining funds would be disbursed in the second stage in accordance with the provisions of the Petroleum Overcharge Distribution and Restitution Act of 1986 (15 U.S.C. &sect;4501) (PODRA). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We provided a 30 day period for the submission of comments concerning the proposed procedures. However, we have received no comments since the PDO was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  more than 30 days ago. The proposed procedures will therefore be adopted in the same form in which they were originally outlined. Immediately set forth below are the specific considerations that will guide our evaluation of refund applications during the first stage. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> III. The First Stage Refund Procedures <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Refund applications submitted in the Aptos special refund proceeding will be evaluated in exactly the same manner as applications submitted in other refined product proceedings. In those proceedings, we have frequently chosen to adopt a number of rebuttable presumptions relating to pricing violations and injury. Such a policy reflects our belief that adoption of certain presumptions (i) permits applicants to participate in refund proceedings in larger numbers by avoiding the need to incur inordinate expense; and (ii) facilitates our consideration of first stage refund applications. 10 C.F.R. 205.282(e). For those reasons, we have adopted similar presumptions in the present proceeding. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Calculating the Refund <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We have presumed that the pricing violations were dispersed equally throughout each firm's gasoline sales during the relevant audit period. We therefore proposed that each applicant's potential refund should be calculated on a volumetric basis. Under the volumetric approach, refunds are calculated by multiplying the gallons of refined product each applicant purchased by the per gallon refund amount (volumetric). Applicants believing they were disproportionately overcharged by the pricing violations may present documentation which supports that claim. Those who succeed in showing they were disproportionately overcharged will be eligible to receive refunds calculated at a higher volumetric. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We have established a separate volumetric for each of the firms whose name appears in the Appendix accompanying this Decision. The precise volumetric for each firm can be found in the Appendix. Each volumetric was obtained by dividing the remedial order funds available for distribution by the volume of gasoline each firm is believed to have sold during the audit period.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> In the absence of precise figures indicating the amount of motor gasoline sold by each firm during the audit period, we have estimated their sales using the best available data. Our estimate is that each gasoline retailer sold 50,000 gallons of motor gasoline per month for each month of the audit period. This figure will be used to calculate each retailer's volumetric unless the refund applications submitted pursuant to this Decision and Order indicate that our estimate is inaccurate. In the event the estimate proves to be inaccurate, it may be necessary to reestimate the volumetric. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (2) Eligibility for a Refund <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In order to be eligible to receive a refund in this proceeding, each applicant must (1) document the volume of motor gasoline it purchased during the consent order period; and (2) demonstrate that it was injured by the overcharges. The threshold requirement for any applicant is documenting the volume of product it purchased. This requirement is typically satisfied when the applicant successfully demonstrates ownership of the business for which the refund is sought and submits documentation which supports the volume claimed in its refund application. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The injury showing, however, is a potentially more difficult requirement for applicants to satisfy, especially those seeking smaller refund amounts. This is true because an applicant must demonstrate that it was forced to absorb the overcharges. Our cases have often stated that an applicant accomplishes this by demonstrating that it maintained a ``bank'' of unrecovered product costs and showing that market conditions would not permit them to pass through those increased costs.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See, Quintana Energy Corp.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 21 DOE &para;85,032 at 88,117 (1991). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

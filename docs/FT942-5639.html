			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Tonic from Boots Boots has again confounded its critics by widening margins in its chemists chain on rising sales. Since most of the headaches acquired with Ward White are also showing improvement - Halfords in particular is starting to perform  -yesterday's 4 per cent rise in the shares looks justified. Still, Boots is earning only Pounds 7m operating profit on retail turnover of Pounds 900m outside the chemists business. It cannot afford to rest on its laurels. Do It All and A G Stanley continue to defy their parent's much vaunted retail skills. With Pounds 150m cash in hand - including the proceeds from the sale of Farley's - Boots can also afford to look for growth elsewhere. The cash position would strengthen further if it decides to get out of prescription pharmaceuticals, although piecemeal disposals look more likely than an outright sale or - given its experience with Do It All - joint ventures. The snag is that credible investment opportunities are thin on the ground. The retail side of the business is generating cash faster than Boots can spend it. Diversification has rightly been ruled out. The best hope for expansion lies in over-the-counter medicines. But such acquisitions do not come cheap. Boots would be bidding against the giants of the pharmaceuticals industry should larger brands become available. It is also doubtful whether Boots has the experience to compete as a serious force in the US. Smaller OTC acquisitions in Europe may thus be the best way forward, even if that means returning some cash to shareholders. Since Boots has still not shaken off the legacy of its last big move, investors might welcome such a cautious approach.</p>

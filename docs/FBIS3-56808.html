In the conversations and talks  between the leaders of the two states, which passed in an  atmosphere of complete mutual understanding and trust, note was  made of the need to strengthen further friendly relations and to  deepen interstate cooperation in all fields.    The presidents informed one another about the sociopolitical  situation in their countries, and there was discussion of a  broad range of issues of mutual interest. The sides exchanged  views on the current situation in Central Asia, the CIS, and  also on a number of international problems. During the talks  note was made of the important role of the accords reached in  January 1993 at the Tashkent meeting of heads of Central Asian  states, which opened up major prospects in deepening  integrational processes. The heads of both states stressed the  particular importance of observing the principles of the  inviolability of the existing borders between the two states,  and spoke in support of constructive efforts in ensuring peace  and stability in Central Asia, and primarily on sections of the  Tajik-Afghan border. Fundamental accords were reached on the  further expansion of mutually advantageous cooperation between  the Republic of Uzbekistan and the Kyrgyz Republic, and a mutual  intention to foster the economic integration of the countries of  the region was reaffirmed.    Kyrgyz President Akayev gave a high assessment of the treaty  on creating a single economic area between the Republic of  Kazakhstan and the Republic of Uzbekistan of 10 January 1994,  and announced the decision of the leadership of the Kyrgyz  Republic to join this treaty, with the consent of the sides. The  treaty on the creation of a single economic area makes provision  for the free movement of goods, services, capital, and labor on  the territory of the states which are party to the treaty, and  ensures coordinated credit, accounting, budget, tax, pricing,  customs, and currency policies between them. The new decision  to unite the economic efforts of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and  Uzbekistan makes provision for the abolition of customs  examination of the baggage and hand luggage of citizens of these  countries on entering and leaving their borders, and also the  abolition of customs duties and the gradual reduction of taxes,  duties, and other kinds of restrictions. With a view to  simplifying the clearing of mutual payments to the national  banks of the said countries, clearing chambers will be opened in  the capitals, and branches in other towns of their countries,  together with currency exchange outlets.    The sides noted in particular that the treaty on the  creation  of a single economic area is fully in line with the treaty on  the creation of an economic union of the CIS, and represents a  new level of economic integration among the independent states.    Uzbek President Islam Karimov stressed that the openness of  the treaty on the creation of a single economic area is an  important prerequisite for expanding mutually advantageous  cooperation and developing the effectiveness of economic  relations between the sovereign states.    The following agreements were signed between the governments  of the Republic of Uzbekistan and the Kyrgyz Republic: on trade  and economic cooperation for 1994; on organizing accounts in  1994; on deepening cooperation in the field of culture, health  care, science and education, tourism, and sports; and a protocol  on making amendments and additions to the agreement on non-trade  payments.    The sides agreed to deepen further cooperation in issues  relating to environmental protection, and in this connection  they made special note of the importance of the fundamental  decisions, taken at the conference of heads of state of Central  Asia and the Russian Federation in the town of Nukus on 11  January 1994, on the problems of the Aral Sea and the Aral basin  aimed at coordinating efforts and deepening cooperation in this  sphere. During the talks an accord was reached on further  developing the treaty and legal foundation between the two  friendly states.    Rukhaniyat, the international association for fostering the  revival of spirituality Rukhaniyat, which assessed the  activities of Republic of Uzbekistan President Islam Karimov as  an outstanding politician and statesman who has made a major  contribution to the cause of establishing good-neighborly  relations between the peoples of Central Asia, conferred on him  a prize for peace and accord between peoples.    Expressing satisfaction with the results of the visit, the  sides stressed that their constructive and fruitful talks will  serve the further development and strengthening of the historic  friendship, mutual understanding, and cooperation between the  peoples of the two fraternal countries.</p>

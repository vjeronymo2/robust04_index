			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / International Bonds: Eurosterling sector may be in need of a short rest THE EUROSTERLING bond market has held up well in the face of more than Pounds 2bn of supply since the UK election. The bullish sentiment which still pervades the market is exaggerated by grim conditions in most other bond markets. But some inventory is beginning to mount up, and the market may be in need of a short rest. The market has coped with heavy supply because other factors have combined to attract crucial groups of investors to the market at the same time. Most bond fund managers were substantially underweight in sterling before last month's election. Since then, they have switched not just to neutral but to overweight positions. A month ago, the sterling bond market was beset by political uncertainty. Now, it is one of a shrinking band not wracked by political problems. At the same time, European retail investors, reluctant to buy the market due to previous negative experiences with the currency, have regained some confidence. Sterling's strength since the election, and the prospect of a move to the narrow band within the exchange rate mechanism have helped convince some, like the Germans, who are no longer preoccupied with their own domestic bond market, to look again. The sterling market is well acquainted with the alternation of feast and famine which characterises most Eurobond market sectors. 'Sterling, like Canadian dollars, is still a hot-money sector,' said one banker. 'It's the flavour of the month, then it's dead for two.' There is as yet little sign that the recent crop of issues represents anything more than the latest burst of activity. But bankers are keen to develop a corporate bond market in sterling, akin to, or at least modelled on, the US corporate bond market. To this end, many are developing stronger credit research capacity. The theory is that there is a long-term trend away from bank lending and towards funding in the bond markets. 'Banks no longer want to lend to corporates in sufficient size. The advent of capital adequacy rules is having a strong impact on the availability of loans,' one banker said. Some companies, realising that loans are much harder to come by, are keener to tap bond markets. Most of the latest batch of issues have been launched by UK companies. Among the crop was an ambitious Pounds 500m deal for Hanson, the largest deal in the sector to date, which lead manager Credit Suisse First Boston claims to have placed. But other bankers suggest there is inventory around, and other paper, like Finland's Pounds 150m deal via Baring Brothers, is not yet fully placed. The preponderance of UK companies in the market is strongly linked to the availability of swaps. Swap spreads have been tight for some time, making the market unattractive for borrowers which do not have a fixed-rate sterling funding requirement. Swap spreads from five through to 10-years are around 30 basis points above gilt yields. So a strong company which would have to offer bonds at a spread of, say, 80 basis points above the gilt yield would have to pay at least 50 basis points above the London interbank offered rate. Of last week's new issues, only the National &amp; Provincial Building Society's five-year deal via JP Morgan, which took advantage of a slight widening of swap spreads, was swapped. However, while companies are eschewing floating-rate funding at the levels available, many do not want to lock in fixed-rate levels yet, since they expect rates to fall further. Indeed, perceived signalling by the Bank of England on Friday of a further reduction in rates is likely to deter corporate treasurers further. The tightness of swap spreads has thus limited the market to UK companies, for the most part, reducing the availability of sovereign and supranational paper. The lack of top quality paper was highlighted last week by the success of a Pounds 200m 10-year Eurobond for the European Investment Bank, launched by Salomon Brothers, which offered a meagre 9 basis point spread above the comparable gilt yield. Not only was the issue snapped up by investors, but the spread has subsequently tightened to five basis points. In fact, the performance was reflected in other sovereign and supranational sterling Eurobonds, which tightened three to four basis points relative to gilts last week. Otherwise, Eurosterling spreads have been steady, a positive sign given the strong performance of the gilts market which the Eurosterling sector normally lags.</p>

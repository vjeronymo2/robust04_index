			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "Videnov's Feint Will Be Assessed </F> in Fall"]    [Text] Formally, the 41st Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP]  Congress ended according to expectations.    Zhan Videnov was reelected. The adoption of the program was  postponed and subjected to a party referendum -- as the chairman  demanded. The congress announced a course toward new elections.    However, unlike previous forums, events that ostensibly did  not occur at the congress prompt the observers to conclude that  nevertheless, something happened in the BSP. The personnel  changes were the most insignificant development.    According to the forecasts the greatest battle at the  congress should have taken place in anything related to the  election of the BSP Supreme Council. No major changes were  anticipated. However, Andrey Lukanov, Dimitur Yonchev, Rosen  Karadimov, and Elena Poptodorova surprisingly were not elected  to this organ.    However, the most improbable development was the failure of  Aleksandur Marinov, seen as the probable next party leader, to  gain election to the Supreme Council. He was supported by the  BSP Sofia city organization and Aleksandur Lilov himself.  However, Marinov could not even qualify as a contender for the  post of BSP leader.    Thus the coup at the top of the party that was planned, did  not take place. According to the laws of the party hierarchy,  from now on the process will follow the domino rule -- other  people will also have to leave the higher floors of the building  on Positano Street [the BSP headquarters].    It was in the issue of the party program that Videnov's  victory became obvious.    The party chief strategist [Aleksandur Lilov] was burdened  by  his program. This was not a strategic burden. He clearly had no  direct commitment to the party leadership. However, isolated in  his strategic center, he composed a program that he saw as  certain to be adopted at the congress. Surprising or not, Zhan  Videnov convincingly defended his position during the debate and  in the final analysis he achieved what he wanted -- the BSP  program will be adopted not by the congress but by a party  referendum.    To be able to assess this victory of Videnov on merit one  should know that Lilov's center worked for two years on its  variant of the program and thought that there would be no  competition. However, two additional competitors appeared --  the draft programs of the Alliance for Social Democracy and the  hardliners of the "Marxist Alternative."    However, at the referendum the party members will not be  asked to select one of the three drafts. They will actually vote  on Lilov's program, which will be amended and supplemented. It  is assumed that the amendments will include the elimination of  the democratic socialism line, proposed by the strategist. Thus  Videnov, who opposes this formula, will achieve another victory.    There is an additional goal behind all this. When Zhan  Videnov imposed the decision on the referendum his secret  intention was related to preparing the BSP position at the next  elections. The people around him clearly hinted that the concept  of democratic socialism stinks and scares the potential allies  of the BSP in a preelection and postelection coalition.    The talks with Petur Dertliev's Social Democrats are at an  advanced phase. However, one of the conditions of forming the  partnership is very categorical -- the Socialists should  relinquish Lilov's yearnings, and declare themselves Social  Democrats.    Videnov's feint in delaying his reply to this demand could  turn out to be rather prudent. However, this will become clear  only at the next elections.    The BSP Congress approved the idea of holding early  parliamentary elections in the fall. This was not by accident  and is not a meaningless demonstration on the party of Videnov.  He wants the elections and has his reasons. The BSP leader  firmly declared that this parliament had exhausted its  possibilities. However, his secret concern is related to new  changes at the National Assembly, which could be uncomfortable  for the Socialists. If Lyuben Berov remains in power, the chance  of the anticommunist majority in the parliament to organize  itself and form a new cabinet improves.    In addition Videnov is convinced that, if the elections take  place in the fall, the BSP will win them.    Nevertheless, the BSP parliamentary faction does not  unequivocally accept the idea of new elections. Nora Ananieva  [leader of the BSP parliamentary faction] pretended that she was  joking when she said at the congress that fall ends on 22  December. Despite the fact that the Socialists unanimously  declare their wish to hold new elections, not all of them want  to risk their seats in the parliament.    The problem of the Socialists' leader is whether the Union  of  Democratic Forces [SDS] really wants new elections, as it has  claimed for a long time, or whether this is a strategic maneuver  of the SDS center. The concern grew even more when the SDS  National Coordinating Council praised the BSP for finally  adopting the idea the SDS constantly promotes. The SDS became  even more suspicious after the scandal between Filip Dimitrov  and Stefan Savov, which could possibly lead toward preserving  the parliament.    Difficult times lie ahead for the BSP. Lukanov, who appeared  to be a permanent fixture, is outside the supreme leadership.  Lilov obviously suffered a defeat. However, will all this be  enough to convince the voters that the BSP is not the Bulgarian  Communist Party any longer?</p>

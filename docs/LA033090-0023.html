			<p><P> March 30, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEDFLY SPRAYING  </P> <P> He doesn't fool me. State Agriculture Director Henry J. Voss hasn't scheduled a  May malathion phase-out, instead of the original June date, out of the goodness  of his heart.  </P> <P> The primary election is in June. He (and the Republican governor who appointed  him) doesn't want the Republican Party to be known as the pro-poison party.  </P> <P> They hope people are stupid enough, in the one-month interval, to forget they  were malathioned against their will. They also hope people don't read between  the lines.  </P> <P> Although Voss talks discontinuance, he has approved spraying some communities  every two weeks instead of every three. Also, he doesn't promise that the state  won't spray in the future.  </P> <P> Caveat emptor.  </P> <P> DORETTA ZEMP  </P> <P> Beverly Hills  </P></p>

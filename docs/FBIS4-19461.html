			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Harald Stanghelle: "New Tasks for the Home </F> Guard?"]    [Text] The military is working hard and with determination  to adjust to a new era with an unclear threat picture. I have  great respect for the military leadership in this regard.    This respect does not extend to the Home Guard's official  publication, HEIMEVERNSBLADET. At that publication they have  chosen a rather special angle when informing the Home Guard  members on the challenges facing the defense forces.    "A Defense Without a Threat, or the Trojan Horse" is the  title of a prominently displayed analysis in the latest issue of  the magazine. The author is described as a Home Guard officer,  author of several books, athletic leader, politician, and also a  highly decorated war hero for "his fight against Nazism." That  makes for a commanding authority.    The message is clear: Europe risks being flooded by people  from poor countries. "These are people from countries where  they need new lebensraum, better economic conditions, not to  mention an expansion of their own culture and religion...."  "Does our military leadership not have the responsibility to  save Norway as a country for Norwegians?"    The parallel to the fight against Nazism is obvious.  "Perhaps today's advisers in several overpopulated and poor  countries are cleverer than Hitler's Goebbels?"    This threat image entices the author of the article to pose  a  number of questions. "Or could this trend have been organized  from abroad? Or could it be groups who already have gained  access to our country and who systematically work for expanded  Islamization which in turn means undermining part of our  Constitution?"    He leaves no doubt what the Norwegian response should be:  "At  all times must it be part of the defense forces' mission to  follow this trend and advise our political leadership.... An  analysis of what forces are behind this is highly appropriate  and it is a natural mission for our military."    HEIMEVERNSBLADET's analyst is Erik Gjems-Onstad. He is known  and honored for everything the magazine presented him as, but he  is also known for something the magazine's editor omitted: He is  active in various politically dubious right-wing, populist,  xenophobic parties.    Are these the issues the Home Guard leadership wants their  officers to discuss? Is this the kind of analysis on which the  defense forces base their assessments? Or is this part of a  trend that is beginning to find its way to frustrated officers?    We certainly do not believe so, but would have felt more  comforted if the Home Guard would find analysts of greater  professional stature the next time the Home Guard wants to paint  the big picture of the future for its officers.</p>

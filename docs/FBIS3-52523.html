			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by King Husayn at a meeting with senior Public </F> Security, General Intelligence, and Civil Defense officers in  Amman on 4 January -- recorded]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] A few days ago, as you know, I  met with your brothers in the Armed Forces. I covered several  important topics that I felt is my duty to explain to the  brothers, the comrades in arms, and the soldiers of the Arabs.  [passage omitted]    This country is the heart of the greater Arab homeland. This  country is the homeland of the emigrants [Meccans who emigrated  to Medina in the early period of Islam] and the followers  [Medinan followers of Prophet Muhammad who granted him refuge].  God willing, this country will remain the example to be  followed in terms of patience, forbearance, and clear vision for  all its sons at all stages. We all safeguard national unity  with our souls, our minds, and our logic, and with an eagerness  to give a good and unique example to the generations to come of  the big meeting that unites the one march. I have said on more  than one occasion, and I mean what I say, that any party which  seeks to harm national unity in this country -- any individual  who seeks to do this -- will be my foe until the end. [passage  omitted]    In the past, and over the past few days, I spoke more than  enough about the atmosphere in which we live and the difficult  circumstances we experience. I spoke about the peace process to  which we are committed, about a comprehensive and just peace,  and the peace that will give the generations to come an  opportunity to live a free, dignified life in a secure and  stable atmosphere and that will unleash their potential  creativity. It is a peace we will not fear if we are armed with  awareness, determination, and resolve and, as is the case, if we  are the sons of a rich experience.    I also spoke about this decisive stage with respect to the  need to put emphasis on Arab action and coordination, starting  with Jordanian-Palestinian coordination. I spoke out of my  concern for the kinsfolk and the brothers in the occupied  territories. We have lived and experienced with them difficult  and harsh circumstances along their path of steadfastness on  their land and their resolve to cling to it. This stage  requires the Palestinian command to choose and to clearly define  the features of its march. We firmly believe that this  leadership will reflect what is in the hearts and minds of the  Palestinian people in the occupied territories and elsewhere,  and that it is rising to the level that will enable it to carry  out its duty and great role in serving the people on the road to  the attainment of their aspirations and hopes concerning their  full rights on their national soil.    Naturally, this could happen through the scenario we hope  for, and in a way where this leadership represents this people  and continues to serve them in the occupied territories, and in  a way where this leadership reassures the kinsfolk and brothers  that it has reached both the stage and level at which it is both  for and from all Palestinians.    Regarding the relationship with us, we are proceeding on a  path that our fathers and grandfathers followed. We broke bread  together. I am talking here about this one people and this one  large family, not only in Jordan but in both Palestine and  Jordan. We have suffered and continue to suffer together.    In this phase, we must reach a situation whose features are  clear, so we can know what is ours and they can know what is  theirs, and all of us can know what is incumbent upon us. In my  opinion, what is being proposed is: Either they seek our  backing--and we are ready to offer it, just as we have always  done from the very beginning--or the other alternative, which I  need not discuss.    As for us here in Jordan, when things go well, God willing,  only then will the choice be presented for those who wish to  stay with us or to choose another road. One can then make up  their mind, and their choice will be respected. Until then,  national unity, democracy, and human rights here should be  preserved. This will not be for a limited period, but will be  the beginning of a serious march with an ongoing objective, God  willing.    This country, God willing, is a symbol and a model for the  brothers in the Arab homeland, in the Islamic world, and  everywhere.    We spoke about Jerusalem. Jerusalem is in the hearts and the  minds of all of us, and it will continue to be that way. I  presented my remarks and ideas on the situation and the  seriousness of this stage, and I voiced my concern that our  relations with our sacred shrines -- and the shrines in  Jerusalem in general -- or the responsibilities for them, may be  affected in one way or another as a result of some development  or circumstances. In order to avoid a new vacuum, as was the  case after 1974, concerning Jerusalem and the shrines, we  explained our view and suggestion. We are continuing our duty  as best we can toward Jerusalem, which is in our hearts and the  minds. We will never forget Jerusalem for one moment.    We talked about what has been proposed with regard to  confederation and related issues. As I asked the Palestinian  leadership to drop this word from its lexicon, I will drop it  from my lexicon also, as of this meeting, not because I do not  believe that this people is one people, but because I believe  that this people, here and there, are the owners of the  decision. The decision with regard to the form of the future  relationship is not imposed by any party or any group of people  -- neither in the Palestinian arena nor here. After the return  of the land to its people and owners, the decision on this issue  will be made in the future in an atmosphere of democracy,  freedom, respect for human rights, and participation in  decisionmaking. God willing, the meeting [al-liqa'] will take  place in one way or another on solid and firm ground with  absolute confidence and accurate knowledge that this Jordan has  always been for Palestine and that Jordan has never had any  ambitions toward it. It has always assumed its duties as King  Husayn I and King 'Abdallah Bin-al-Husayn assumed their duties.  We have been performing this duty until today.    Then, any formula that comes up will be the accepted and  agreed upon formula through convergence of opinion -- whether  the choice was made here or there. Therefore, all these will  become guarantees to safeguard the march from what it will face  in the future.    Our talk in the past about this issue aimed at enabling our  brothers to reach what they have reached and to shoulder the  responsibilities they accepted in order to represent the  Palestinian Arab people in terms of their rights. We were, we  are, and we will continue to be committed to our stand with  regard to the Rabat summit resolution -- regardless of any other  consideration -- because our kinsfolk and brothers, the owners  of this right, opted for this road. We supported them and we  will continue to support with all our potential.    We hope that it was a method that helped them reach the  situation in which they represent themselves in the world. We  ask God to help them maintain their credibility toward all their  commitments. I am not speaking in general terms here, I am  talking in particular about what concerns us here in Jordan. In  other words, I hope that within a short period of time we will  reach a clear, common view regarding all important issues. We  will adhere to our pledges. We have always kept our pledges.  However, if things remain as they were, particularly since we  endured a great deal, this will be a risky thing not only with  regard to Palestine, the cause and rights on Palestinian soil,  but also with regard to Jordan.    I have a great hope that during this period -- I said  Tuesday, it seems now that it might be Wednesday or  Thursday...[pauses] Without sincerity and cooperation to serve  people and the cause, I do not believe we can proceed and wait  forever. We are very concerned about assuming our duty and  role. We hope that we will be in a position in which we can  achieve this. We are aware of the burdens and responsibilities  shouldered by this Palestinian leadership in this delicate  stage. However, these are responsibilities that it opted to  shoulder. With God's help, it will reach the level in which we  can support it in all details and matters that must be tackled  by all of us.    We hope that it is seen in the world as a responsible party  that represents all those it is shouldering the responsibility  of representing. We hope that it will be flanked with the great  human resources that are available in the arena and will be  credible so that it will be able to move ahead, God willing, and  so that all these initial developments will be the beginning of  reaching the aspired objectives, with God's help.    I spoke about coordination with our brothers, and this is  something that is taking place with our brothers in Syria,  Lebanon, and Egypt. Again, if the Arab trend has been toward a  comprehensive solution, then we have kept our commitment to work  for a comprehensive solution.    If some thought that this country, for one reason or  another,  and due to the burden and responsibilities it is bearing, might  choose a different path, such expectations have not been  realized, praise be to God.    A sisterly Arab country had concluded a peace treaty with  Israel. We all agreed on the same objective when we agreed to go  to Madrid. The Palestinian brothers--of whom we are part, whom  we supported, and for whom we shouldered the responsibility  until 1974--chose to shoulder the responsibility. This decision  received an all-out Arab blessing. We were committed to a  similar position toward them, and we will continue to be so.  They have chosen to go with us, even formally in a certain  stage when the umbrella was there, before we threw it in the  wastebasket of history, and before they directly shouldered  their responsibilities.    Now, we are continuing our search and efforts, and everyone  knows that since 1974 we have followed a clear path. We have  been committed to a firm position. Neither before 1974, nor  since the adoption of the Security Council Resolution 242 --  which the PLO accepted alongside Resolution 338 as the basis of  what is going on now, nor after the disengagement of  administrative and legal links with the West Bank, did we ever  bargain for one moment on a grain of the Palestinian soil or any  of the Palestinian rights on Palestinian soil. Our position has  been the same since 1974, and we have been supporting the PLO  position from 1974 until now.    A greeting to all the sons of the homeland, under all  circumstances, at this critical stage. A greeting of pride and  appreciation. At the same time, we take pride in those who  shouldered their serious and sensitive responsibilities under  these circumstance by representing Jordan in the peace talks  from the beginning when a national decision was made to go to  Madrid. In every circumstance they were brave men who did not  fear meeting with others, working for the sake of our interests,  and preserving the right to live for the people and the whole  nation.    We hope that matters will move toward a comprehensive  solution with the participation of all sides, stage after stage,  and in light of the fact that we all have proceeded from the  same point. I have previously mentioned, and I reiterate it  now, that despite all pressures, we in this country are not  prepared to sign a peace treaty unless we deal with all issues  and matters in a satisfactory and balanced way acceptable to us  and to the other party. When all these issues are dealt with,  peace will follow in the final analysis or be the beginning for  a new stage in which every one lives in security and stability  and in which doors are opened wide, God willing, to progress and  development for people to live in circumstances from which we  were deprived from the beginning. We concentrate on land,  water, human rights, and all the topics included in the agenda  that we have endorsed in support of progress on the  Palestinian-Israeli track.    As you all know, we stayed behind, waiting for something. A  surprise followed, and we decided to approve the agenda  pertaining to the issues between Jordan and Israel. We also  described the Palestinian step as courageous, and we hoped the  leadership would rise to the required level. We hope that the  Palestinian arena will be one in which all people meet with  clear vision and unity in this critical situation. At the end  of this meeting, I repeat my thanks to and appreciation for all  the brothers, and I hope you will convey my heartfelt greetings  to all the brothers who share your responsibilities in your  various fields, as well as our love for and pride in you. We  are part of this great march, which will achieve, with God's  help, all its goals. God bless you, and God's peace be upon  you. [applause]</p>

			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / International Company News: Hoechst stable in first two months Hoechst, the German chemicals concern, yesterday reported an 'insignificant' rise in group operating profits in the first two months of the current year, and no change in domestic earnings or sales. Growth of 5 per cent in turnover at the parent, Hoechst AG, was entirely due to a 9 per cent increase in exports, according to Mr Wolfgang Hilger, the retiring chairman. Hoechst, the last of Germany's big three chemicals makers to report on progress, was markedly less optimistic than Bayer, which last week confidently predicted an earnings increase this year of up to 20 per cent. BASF said it expected to raise profits in spite of facing a sharply higher tax bill. Mr Hilger restricted his forecasts to the view that the low point of the recession had been passed and the long-awaited light on the horizon was visible. Group orders had increased for the first time in two years, although domestic demand was unchanged. Mr Jurgen Dormann, finance director, who takes over from Mr Hilger next month, was gloomy on prospects in Germany. He doubted if domestic profits would be enough to pay a dividend. Part of this year's pay-out would have to come from foreign earnings and an expected DM200m (Dollars 118m) residual tax rebate. The group, which announced a DM7 dividend for 1993, down DM2 following a 42 per cent drop in pre-tax earnings on unchanged sales of DM46bn, blamed most of last year's downturn on poor conditions in Europe. Operating profits in the European Union tumbled to DM289m from DM1bn in 1992. The region, accounting for 60 per cent of output, generated only 20 per cent of operating income. Other regions, apart from Latin America, showed modest increases, while operating profits fell in all business sectors apart from technical and agricultural products. Chemicals, fibres and plastics suffered from falling volumes and prices, while business was hit by the miserable condition of the European textile and automotive industries, Mr Hilger said. Better results were achieved from raw materials for detergents. Carbon products had shown a real turnround, and the plant protection business outside Europe had improved. Mr Hilger, who said the company spent or set aside DM1bn last year for restructuring - two-thirds within Germany - indicated that process would continue. He gave few details, apart from warning of more job losses to come. A reduction of 12,000 in the workforce in the past three years was to be followed by a further 8,000 this year and next. Total annual personnel costs would be cut by about DM1.5bn.</p>

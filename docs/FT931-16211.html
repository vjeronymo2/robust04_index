			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / Spending curbs threaten 6,000 council jobs in Midlands UP to 6,000 jobs in Birmingham and the Black Country could disappear as local authorities struggle to comply with government spending constraints. The region's six local authorities - Birmingham, Dudley, Sandwell, Solihull, Walsall and Wolverhampton - are scrutinising their spending programmes in the hope of bringing expenditure in line with their anticipated income for 1993-94, the main element of which is the government's revenue support grant. To avoid capping - the government's imposition of a limit on expenditure and local tax gathering - every council will have to restructure to reduce total payrolls. Councils to take action this week include Birmingham, which may shed 3,000 jobs. With more than 2,000 employees over the age of 50, Birmingham is seeking voluntary redundancies. Dudley has written to all employees warning them that cuts totalling Pounds 17.5m need to be made to avoid capping. This means that, in addition to 235 voluntary redundancies already agreed, a further 750 jobs could go from a workforce of 13,000. Over the next fortnight Sandwell will look for Pounds 11.5m of cuts, and will negotiate with unions over 300 proposed redundancies in its contract services departments. If those are not agreed, the council fears that 1,000 jobs may be lost. Walsall, now under Conservative-Liberal Democrat control, will meet unions to discuss up to 500 job cuts as part of a plan to save Pounds 11.5m in the next financial year and more in the following year. Compulsory job losses should be less severe in Solihull and Wolverhampton. Solihull, claiming the lowest ratio of council employees to total population of any local authority in the country, is pruning spending plans by Pounds 2.6m, but is well within its capping limits. It does not forecast 'swingeing redundancies'. Wolverhampton went through a significant cost-cutting exercise last year. when Pounds 12m was sliced from the budget and 600 jobs were lost. In the coming year the council will cut a further Pounds 7m from the budget, but has 356 applications for voluntary redundancy and expects compulsory redundancies to be low because of natural wastage. In absolute terms, the largest number of job losses among authorities in the Birmingham-Black Country conurbation will be in Birmingham where, before Christmas, the council predicted 3,000 voluntary or compulsory redundancies. Since then the council has found greater flexibility. It has convinced the government that mistakes of statistical interpretation were made in its standard spending assessment - the amount the government thinks a local authority should spend. This boosts its assessment to Pounds 887.8m for 1993-94 from Pounds 879m. Although this will probably not affect the number of posts Birmingham will lose, it should mean that cuts will be made with greater sensitivity and not imposed across the board. In contrast, Walsall has little flexibility. According to Mr Mike Bird, the Conservative leader, Pounds 40m needs to be saved over the next two years to bring the budget under control. Charging that the previous Labour administration 'robbed the balances', Mr Bird described the present budgetary situation as 'quite frightening'.</p>

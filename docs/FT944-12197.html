			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Fresh highs reached at London Metal Exchange Investment funds and speculators returned in force to the London Metal Exchange yesterday to send most base metals prices to fresh peaks. Only aluminium failed to beat the previous high in the present buying spree, but its price still closed last night Dollars 46 above Monday's level at Dollars 1,855.50 a tonne for delivery in three months. Copper moved above Dollars 2,700 a tonne for the first time in four years, helped by weakness of the US dollar, which is making dollar-denominated LME prices look cheaper in terms of other currencies. Traders said that buying from the Far East yesterday helped to lift copper values. The nickel market reached the highest price levels for two and a quarter years, as did the lead market, while tin climbed to a 20-month peak. Even zinc, which at the begining of this year was thought by many analysts to be the LME metal with the most negative fundamental outlook, rose above Dollars 1,150 a tonne to reach a two-year peak. Mr Angus MacMillan, research manager at Billiton Metals, part of the Gencor group, explained that there was a growing perception among investors that the tide was turning for the zinc market. Even so, the market was expected to see a 283,000-tonne supply surplus this year. If the announced output cuts held, however, there might be a 250,000-tonne deficit in 1995, if Billiton was correct in its forecast that demand for the metal would grow by a 'hefty' 5 per cent. On that basis Billiton was forecasting that the average zinc price for next year would be about 55 cents a pound (Dollars 1,212 a tonne). But Mr MacMillan warned that it would not take much to wipe out the predicted supply deficit, so much depended on production cuts staying in place.  -----------------------------------------------               LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS  ----------------------------------------------- (As at Monday's close) tonnes  ----------------------------------------------- Aluminium             -34,600 to 2,024,375 Aluminium alloy          +140 to    25,680 Copper                 -1,975 to   333,100 Lead                   -1,375 to   369,775 Nickel                   +558 to   149,820 Zinc                   -1,200 to 1,210,100 Tin                       -75 to    30,265  -----------------------------------------------</p>

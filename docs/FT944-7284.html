			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / People: Tiphook finds a new finance director Tiphook - soon to be renamed Central Transport Rental Group - yesterday appointed Richard Raine as its new finance director - part of a spate of senior management changes by newly-appointed chairman Ian Clubb. In the past year, four of Tiphook's five executive directors have resigned, leaving only founder and chief executive Robert Montague with any long-term knowledge of its sharply diminished business. Indeed. Raine is replacing Andrew Chandler, who lasted only one year. He will be moving into a fairly hot seat. The company sold off its largest operating business - container leasing - last March. It is facing a US Class Action over bond issues in the US in 1992/1993; it remains saddled with Pounds 512.5m of debt, and two operating businesses which both lost money last year. However, Raine is likely to get firm assistance from Clubb, the former finance director of BOC, who has taken a hands-on approach to Tiphook that belies his non-executive status. Raine, a chartered accountant, was finance director of Bloomsbury Publishing before its recent flotation, and has worked for a variety of other companies, including building materials group Wickes. He is also being joined by a new company secretary, Simon Enoch, who previously worked at Kingfisher subsidiary B&amp;Q. Further reshuffling among Tiphook's non-executive directors is expected to follow, which could result in a complete turnround of the board (except for Montague) within a 12-month period. Kenneth Dick, the 81-year-old former Rothschild director, and Rupert Hambro, the urbane merchant banker who took Tiphook's chairmanship for a brief but turbulent period, are both expected to go. The future of Montague himself has been in question, as he faced bankruptcy charges, which, if successful, would disbar him from holding a directorship. The hearing will be held in Oxford on December 22 but Montague is pushing for an Individual Voluntary Arrangement. This would provide a structure for partial repayment of creditors, while he retained his job.</p>

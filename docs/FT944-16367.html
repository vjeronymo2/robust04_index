			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / International Company News: Goodyear sees higher third-term earnings Goodyear, the US tyre maker, said that it would report third-quarter earnings of between 97 cents and Dollars 1 a share, a range which puts it in line with most market forecasts, writes Richard Waters in New York. Mr Stanley Gault, chairman, gave the projection in a speech to a meeting of securities analysts yesterday. Sales for the period to the end of September were more than 6 per cent up on the Dollars 2.9bn of the 1993 period, he added. The improvement in earnings per share, from 92 cents a year earlier, comes against the background of rising rubber prices, which had threatened to put pressure on margins. Separately, Goodyear said it would acquire a 60 per cent interest in a manufacturing joint venture with Quingdao Gold Lion Hose, the largest producer of automotive hose in China. The total investment for the joint venture is valued at Dollars 20m, of which 60 per cent will come from Goodyear.</p>

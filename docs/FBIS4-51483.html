			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, May 29 (XINHUA) -- Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin said today that Russia will implement timely the  bilateral agreements signed during his four-day official visit  to China.    "It was very satisfactory, everything went smoothly," the  Prime Minister said when he got off his plane at the Vnukovo  Airport, Moscow, today after ending his Chinese trip.    Chernomyrdin told XINHUA at the airport that he was very  satisfied with the visit during which he met with Chinese  President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng and seven bilateral  agreements were signed.    He stressed that Russia and China, both great countries, are  embarking on reform.    Though the two countries are different in their situations,  they can help each other make up their deficiencies, he said.    The cooperation between them, he added, will solve not only  some of the issues that have appeared in the Asian and Pacific  region but also many of those in the world.</p>

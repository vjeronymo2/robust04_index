			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / UK Company News: A building dilemma for forecasters - Conflicting signals from the construction sector IN WHICH direction is the UK construction industry heading? Analysts trying to make sense of conflicting signals currently emanating from the industry may be forgiven for feeling confused. Their dilemma will not have been made easier by contrasting views about the health of the market voiced yesterday by two of the industry's largest companies. BICC, owner of the Balfour Beatty construction company, and Marley, the building materials group, both of which announced half year results yesterday, expressed themselves very differently about prospects for the sector. Mr David Trapnell, chief executive of Marley, which supplies a wide range of clay, concrete and plastic components to builders, spoke confidently about an industry which had passed its worst. Recovery, he said, had slowed since the spring but sales were still moving upwards, albeit more gradually. Prices charged to customers, also, had improved although they still had a long way to go to recover ground lost during the past 18 months, he said. In contrast, Sir Robin Biggam, chairman of BICC, spoke disparagingly of a 'disappointingly slow recovery' in the UK, North America and Australia. The short-term trading outlook remained difficult, he said. Although the UK economy was showing signs of stabilising, construction prices and opportunities to tender for work were weak. Growth would have to come from international markets, mainly from the Asia-Pacific region. The main difference in the perspective of two companies is that while UK housebuilding has improved other construction markets, notably office development, remain deeply depressed because of over-building in the late 1980s. Contracting and construction shares during the past 12 months have risen by more than three quarters, according to the FT-Actuaries indices - outperforming the FT-A All-Share index by more than 30 per cent. This makes construction the fourth best performing share sector behind merchant banks, other financials and commercial property. Yet most forecasts from the industry expect construction output to fall by a further 1 per cent to 1.5 per cent this year. Next year output is forecast to rise by only about 1 per cent. This hardly suggests a robust recovery to support such a strong rise in share prices. The historic p/e ratio for contracting and construction shares has gone off the scale at more than 80 (the FT-A indices do not measure sector ratios of more than 80), while building material shares command a historic p/e of more than 40. Mr Leslie Kent, construction analyst with brokers Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken, said yesterday: 'These kinds of earnings multiples suggest an increase in construction output and prices which we consider completely unrealistic given the over-supply of contractors and building materials. This has not been helped by the downturn in continental European construction markets. 'The British market is beginning to recover in some areas but progress is gradual and is offset by continuing declines in other areas.' Mr Trapnell says an improvement in new house sales and house repair and maintenance during the spring boosted sales of bricks, roof tiles, aerated concrete blocks, plastic plumbing and decorative products enabling the group to put up some prices. This improvement has not been matched by recovery in other areas of construction, according to Mr Trapnell, who says the failure to replace large scale works on the Channel tunnel, which have been completed, and projects in London's Docklands has reduced opportunities for general construction work. BICC, a member of the Anglo-French consortium building the Channel tunnel, has much higher exposure to commercial and industrial building markets as well as large scale road, rail, water and electricity generation infrastructure projects. It, therefore, has proportionately less to gain from a housing recovery. Its fortunes are more dependent upon investment decisions taken by government ministers and company directors in other industrial and commercial sectors. Companies, however, are unlikely to fully regain confidence until they see a much greater improvement in consumer spending which depends in part on the health of the housing market. Mr Trapnell says the large sales increases reported by housebuilders in the spring have subsequently slowed but this may be through normal seasonal factors - as potential buyers depart for summer holidays - rather than the recovery faltering. Comparisons with a year ago of new house sales in September, October and November may also be inconclusive. These will be measured against a dreadful last autumn when the housing market virtually collapsed as interest rates fluctuated wildly and sterling withdrew from the ERM. Marley's view is that the UK housing market, after allowing for seasonal and other distortions, has embarked on a gradual recovery which will lead to house sales rising 'by perhaps 5 per cent a year rather than some of the big jumps we have seen in previous recoveries.' This may be encouraging for home owners and some hard pressed housebuilders and building material companies but hardly seems sufficient to justify the scale of share price increases seen in the sector during the past 12 months.</p>

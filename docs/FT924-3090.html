			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / London Stock Exchange: Legals helped by US A POSITIVE meeting on Monday evening between Legal &amp; General (Legals), the insurance group, and Morgan Stanley, one of the most influential of the US investment banks, was the trigger for an outstanding performance by L &amp; G shares. The shares ended a busy session 14 higher at 423p, a rise of 3.4 per cent against a 0.6 per cent gain in the Footsie and a generally lack-lustre showing by the rest of the insurance sectors. Morgan Stanley's insurance specialist, Mr Youssef Ziai, said L &amp; G had indicated that the domestic mortgage indemnity problems that have dogged L &amp; G as well as other UK insurance groups had been addressed and that there was now some light at the end of the tunnel. Mr Ziai also said it was encouraging that L &amp; G's market share in life and pensions had continued to pick up, rising from around 3 1/2 per cent in the first quarter of the year to 3.9 per cent by the third quarter, with a figure of 4.5 per cent now in prospect. The US investment bank did not alter its profits expectations for L &amp; G but emphasised the 12 per cent discount to net asset value and the possibility that the group may nudge up the final dividend. Forte doubts Reversing its initially guarded support for Monday's disposal of Gardner Merchant by Forte, the stock market began to show misgivings yesterday when several brokers hinted that they were considering downgrading profit forecasts in the hotel group. Criticisms expressed were that the deal could ultimately prove dilutive and that Forte should have taken the extra cash rather than retain a stake in the new venture. With hotel trading expected to make only a slow recovery, earnings growth may be restricted and some believe the hotel group's dividend to still be at risk. The shares slipped a penny to 166 1/2 p. County NatWest was recommending a switch out of Forte and into Ladbroke, the shares jumping 8 to 196p. UBS Phillips and Drew is also forecasting the stock to be one of its 10 star performers in 1993. TI hurt Engineering company TI Group registered one of the largest falls in the aerospace-related sector after the news that North West Airlines of the US had cancelled orders for 74 aircraft manufactured by the European Airbus consortium. Analysts said the news would hit TI through its Dowty Group subsidiary, which was acquired after a hostile bid earlier this year. It makes the landing gear on the aircraft. The shares responded by bucking the strong market trend and closed 7 lower at 296p, after trade of 3.7m. Mr Chris Avery at Smith New Court said: 'This further deterioration in Dowty's prospects will make it harder for TI to avoid a material earnings dilution in 1993.' Oil shares delivered another dismal showing, affected mostly by the decline in the dollar against sterling. BP retreated 4 to 224p on turnover of 8.6m with the market acutely disappointed by the outcome of BP's presentation to UK and US oil specialists on Monday. At the meeting Mr David Simon, BP's chief executive appeared to rule out an increase in BP's dividend before 1985. 'The bulls are in disarray and the bears in the ascendancy,' said one analyst. Some of the market's more bullish analysts had expected a return to dividend growth by 1993/4 while the bears had not expected such a move until 1994. The US specialists, who have promoted much of the buying interest in BP shares in recent months and increased US interest in the stock to around the 21 per cent level, were said to have been especially dismayed by the dividend news. Switching from BP to Shell saw the latter edge up 3 to 545p on 3m. Enterprise retreated 9 to 447p and Lasmo 8 to 154p, the latter on heavy turnover of 3.6m. With the market beginning to adopt a more positive outlook for domestic mortgage indemnity composites with big exposure in this area performed relatively well. Sun Alliance, acknowledged as having the biggest indemnity exposure, managed a minor improvement at 330p. Royal Insurance, however, moved up strongly, boosted by the better outlook for DMI and the prospect that the shares are one of the favourites for inclusion in the prestigious Footsie-100 list when the FTSE steering committee meets today. At the close Royal shares were 5 better at 265p with a hefty 6.4m traded. A block of 1.5m Royals was easily absorbed the market early in the session HSBC and Standard Chartered were outstanding performers in an otherwise subdued banks area of the market with dealers taking the view that both stocks had been oversold. HSBC raced up 15 to 479p on good turnover of 8.8m shares, while Standard Chartered, along with Royal Insurance, one of the front-runners for inclusion in the Footsie-100, advanced 13 to 523p. Abbey National slipped 4 to 354p after reports that Smith New Court had reduced their profits estimates for the bank. Results in line with expectations from Vaux were given the added boost of a maintained dividend. Investors were attracted by the fact that the stock goes ex on Monday. Although the brewery and hotel group said trading conditions had been tough, business had improved since the year end in September. Brokers downgraded by around 5 per cent to a range Pounds 24-Pounds 28m. Dividend attractions brought other investors into the drinks sector yesterday. Bass, which also goes ex-dividend on Monday, gained 9 to 611p, Greenalls 7 to 354p and Scottish and Newcastle 12 to 425p. Dollar earners were also strong: Allied Lyons rose 4 to 643p and Grand Metropolitan 11 to 435p. Vague hints that trading was under pressure at Burton were heard, with suggestions from some corners that business at both Debenhams and Burtons outlets was suffering. However, one leading analyst was largely dismissive arguing that the recovery in the retail sector was still very patchy and that any short-term downturn was not surprising. The shares slipped a half-penny to 62 1/2 p. James Capel was said to have returned positive on margins from a visit to Boots, the shares lifting 6 to 534p. The food retail sector reached a 5-year high against the FT-All Share index, although turnover was thin and analysts wary that it may have overrun. Argyll and Sainsbury led the way, rising 6 to 405p and 5 to 542p respectively. The volatile Kwik Save jumped 13 to 788p. Rumours of further downgrades in ICI undermined the stock, although no firm evidence was forthcoming. The company's joint broker, Hoare Govett, had slashed its profits forecasts for 1993 and 1994 on Monday, blaming weak trading conditions in October. The shares declined a further 9 yesterday to 1016p. Tadpole Technology, the computer software group, followed up Monday's highly successful market debut with another strong run, the shares surging a further 28 to 113p; they were originally placed with investors at 65p a share by Henry Cooke Lumsden, the stockbroker. Shares in British Aerospace had a volatile session. They fell 7 to 134p, early in the day on the cancellation by North West Airlines of its Airbus aircraft order. BAe not only builds the wings on the aircraft but is also a 20 per cent partner in the Airbus consortium. However the belief that the collapse of the European Fighter Aircraft (EFA)project may be averted helped sentiment and the shares rallied to close a penny lighter at 140p. Shares in international conglomerate Lonrho continued to attract attention and they closed a penny firmer at 74p, on vague talk in the market late in the day, that chief executive Mr Tiny Rowland would soon announce the sale of part of his holding in the company, a rights issue and a sizeable disposal. Turnover which had languished for most of the day had jumped to 1.3m by the close. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992 NEW HIGHS (70). OTHER FIXED INTEREST (1) Utd. Mex.

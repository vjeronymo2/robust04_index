			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / International Company News: NEC pledges more cash to bolster ailing Groupe Bull NEC, the Japanese electronics company, said yesterday it would invest Y7bn (Dollars 64.5m) in Groupe Bull as part of a recapitalisation plan for France's loss-making state-owned computer manufacturer. The investment, which will add to the FFr8.6bn pledged by the French government and France Telecom, will maintain NEC's stake in Bull at 4.43 per cent. The two companies said they would expand co-operation in activities including computers, electronic components and communications. The Japanese company said it was essential to maintain its relationship with Bull if it was to continue developing its business in Europe. 'Bull is an important strategic partner,' said one NEC official. The French company is an important customer for NEC's memory chips, of which it buys about Y1bn worth annually. It it also buys liquid crystal displays and application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) from the Japanese company. The two companies have co-operated on the development of mainframe computers, particularly for the business market. According to the agreement outlined yesterday, Bull and NEC will extend their collaboration in both hardware and software, as well as in mainframes and personal computers. NEC will continue to supply Bull with liquid crystal displays, ASICs and dynamic random access memory chips. Bull will help market NEC's communications and computer products in Europe, particularly in eastern Europe and the republics of the former Soviet Union. For Bull, yesterday's announcement is the second significant development since Mr Jean-Marie Descarpentries took over as chairman in October. His task is to restore the computer group to profitability and prepare it for privatisation. Last month, Mr Descarpentries announced a restructuring of the group's organisation, including the establishment of a new senior executive board, the creation of new operating divisions and a shift towards service activities. The injection of fresh capital, however, is critical to the company's recovery. Accumulated losses over the past three years amount to almost FFr15bn (Dollars 256.8m), and the group's debts are estimated at about FFr10bn.</p>

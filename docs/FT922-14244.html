			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Belgian political 'TGV' pulls along slowcoaches: Prime Minister Dehaene seeks economic results BELGIAN newspapers are calling Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene the 'TGV'. In their eyes, Mr Dehaene, who took over as Belgium's prime minister only a month ago, is an express train pulling Belgium's political slowcoaches behind him. On Sunday, Mr Dehaene proved that he had both speed and weight, by announcing, after just three days of formal discussion, a programme of swingeing budget control measures aimed at putting Belgium on track for economic and monetary union with its EC partners. The package should produce savings and extra tax revenues of some BFr75bn (Dollars 2.2bn), to add to the benefits of VAT restructuring and internal savings on civil service expenditure, which have already been announced. Belgium has to cut its budget deficit from 6.3 per cent of gross national product in 1991, to 3 per cent by the end of 1996. Mr Dehaene reckons these measures will help reduce the deficit to 5 per cent by the end of this year. Some economists believe he is calculating Belgium's progress using slightly more relaxed criteria than his EC partners would allow, but the speed with which Mr Dehaene has acted is still impressive. 'Very un-Belgian,' said Mr Gary Smith, European economist with Merrill Lynch in London yesterday. 'And they seem to have done it without squabbling. We are obviously in a new era.' The nature of some of the measures - in particular the curb on spending in the social security sector - is another indication of the urgency of the government's task. In the past, centre-left coalitions like this one have shied away from penalising Belgian citizens in socially sensitive areas. Whether the package - which includes a 1 per cent social security tax and a new 'taxe de luxe' on cars - will achieve the impact predicted by Mr Dehaene is a different matter. Mr Peter Claes, an economist with Banque Bruxelles Lambert in Brussels, pointed out yesterday that although the mechanical effect of direct measures is comparatively easy to calculate, it is less easy to predict how much will be saved by, for example, plans to tighten up on dole fraud, or close loopholes in the tax system. 'You have to look at the social and political impact, as well as the financial impact of such measures,' he added. Budget proposals require only a simple majority in the Belgian parliament, which will not pose any problem for the centre-left coalition. But to achieve his government's second goal - institutional reform - Mr Dehaene will have to attract allies from opposition parties to make up a two-thirds majority. Formal 'dialogue' between the feuding French-speaking and Flemish communities of Belgium began yesterday, with the goal of devolving further powers to the regions peacefully. However painful the budget cuts, political and economic analysts are worried that institutional reform will be the issue which derails the Dehaene train.</p>

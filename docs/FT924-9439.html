			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / The Maastricht Vote: Lib Dems turn fire on Labour's 'night of fun' MR PADDY ASHDOWN launched a fierce attack on Labour last night, accusing the party of 'discreditable opportunism' for opposing the government motion. He promised to support Maastricht's early ratification - not to back the government's but Britain's future in Europe. The Liberal Democrat leader warned that 'the cost of one night's fun for Labour' could be tens of thousands of lost jobs. Delaying the treaty's ratification would damage economic confidence and stem inward investment. Amid repeated heckling by Labour MPs furious at his party's decision to back the government motion, Mr Ashdown derided as 'legalistic analysis', the claim of Mr John Smith, Labour leader, that the motion was one of confidence in the government. 'If the government loses this debate tonight, will there be a general election tomorrow? The answer is No. There will be a vote of confidence tomorrow which the government will win because turkeys don't vote for Christmas. 'Then on Friday morning we will wake up without a general election and with Britain's future in Europe desperately damaged,' Mr Ashdown said. If would not make any difference if the Commons forced Mr Major to resign to be replaced by Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary - but the economic consequences for Britain would be far graver. If the debate had been a genuine opportunity to remove the government from office, he said, Liberal Democrats would not have missed the chance. Mr Ashdown said Maastricht was not perfect. He regretted the 'opt-outs' on the social chapter and on economic and monetary union. But unless the treaty's ratification was allowed to proceed, any future, more pro-European government would not be able to re-instate those parts, he said. Mr Ashdown did not receive support from other minor parties. Mr Seamus Mallon, deputy leader of Northern Ireland's Social Democratic and Labour party, signalled that he did not believe the motion was entirely about the Maastricht treaty. Although his party backs the treaty, the Commons was not been given a chance to debate it 'on its merits', he said.</p>

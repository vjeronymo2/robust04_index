			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The U.S. Threat To Use Force"] </F>   [Text] The U.S. secretary of the Army has threatened that  if certain countries do not abandon their nuclear programs, the  United States will use force to terminate their programs.  Addressing special centenary celebrations for the U.S. Army  Command and Staff College, he said that some countries have  acquired the capability to manufacture nuclear weapons. The  United States is trying to persuade them in a friendly manner,  but it will not refrain from using force if these efforts fail.  Ejazul Haq, a former Pakistani minister and member of the  National Assembly who was present at the function, told JANG's  special correspondent that although the secretary did not  mention Pakistan in his speech, it was obvious that he was  referring to us. This is because he addressed Ejazul Haq in  particular before mentioning the threat to use force and excused  himself to Haq when he did mention it.    The United States is keenly interested in nuclear  nonproliferation. It is no secret that it is striving to  realize this objective throughout the world. It is also  evident, though, that the U.S. campaign against nuclear weapons  is neither equitable nor impartial. It has no objection to  certain countries' nuclear programs and is indirectly assisting  and supporting the advancement and success of their programs.  The most conspicuous example is Israel.    Informed sources are aware that Israel not only has the  capability to produce nuclear weapons, it also has a huge  stockpile of such weapons. Despite knowing this, the United  States has never expressed any concern about Israel's nuclear  capability or threatened Israel. On the contrary, Israel tops  the list of countries receiving U.S. foreign aid. The two  countries have pursued very close and longstanding technical  cooperation. It would not be incorrect to say that the United  States and Israel are two bodies sharing a single heart. It is  also no secret why the United States has been ignoring the  Israeli nuclear program. The United States considers Israel its  closest ally in the Middle East, like a virtual state of the  United States, and is deeply interested in accelerating its  defense and nuclear capabilities.    Similarly, although the United States keeps protesting  against the Indian nuclear program, it has never adopted a tough  stand against the increase in India's nuclear capability, as it  has with Pakistan or North Korea. In fact, there were occasions  when the United States -- through France -- indirectly helped  India continue its nuclear program. Given the circumstances,  the U.S. threat to use force against Pakistan is very  regrettable and deserves to be condemned. This attitude is all  the more amazing in view of the fact that Pakistan has already  made some very rational and just proposals for winding up its  nuclear program. Pakistan has proposed that the Indian Ocean be  made a nuclear-free zone. Pakistan has expressed its readiness  to open its nuclear installations for international inspection  on the condition that India does the same.    Pakistan has also expressed its willingness to sign the  Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty provided that India does as  well. India has not made any positive response to these  rational and practical proposals. The logical next step would  have been for the United States and the Western powers to exert  pressure on India to achieve the goal of nuclear  nonproliferation. Even if we acknowledge that such pressure was  exerted, we cannot deny it was done in a half-hearted manner.    During U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Talbott's recent visit  to Pakistan, Pakistan expressed its willingness to implement any  just proposal on nuclear nonproliferation. The Indian response,  on the other hand, was disappointing. Under the circumstances,  the U.S. secretary's threat of using force against Pakistan is  incomprehensible and extremely regrettable. We are fully  confident that despite the U.S. secretary's threat, Pakistan  will adhere to its principled stand and that the United States  will not succeed in bullying this country. It is inappropriate  for the United States to use such language.    Certain quarters of the Pakistani Government are overly  optimistic that a way can be found to provide limited defense  aid to Pakistan despite the Pressler Amendment. The latest  pronouncement by the U.S. secretary of the Army should be enough  of an eye opener. The Pakistani Government should seriously make  every possible effort to meet its defense needs through  non-American sources. Also, the government should obtain the  text of the secretary's speech, examine its implications, and  lodge a protest with the U.S. Government if warranted.</p>

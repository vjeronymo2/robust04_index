			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / The Conservative Party At Brighton: Quotes of the day 'I know that I'm going to be abused by the Euro-philes as reactionary, bigoted, narrow-minded, anti-European, timid, isolationist and much more besides.' Lord Tebbit 'Roy Hattersley - the only man to move from the cabinet table to the restaurant table and consider it a promotion.' Sir Norman Fowler 'He must be the only man in the whole of Europe who wants more power for Jacques Delors than Jacques Delors wants for himself.' Sir Norman Fowler on Paddy Ashdown 'The Europe in which I believe is not a United States of Europe. It is a united Europe of states.' Kenneth Baker '(EC) Commissioners are politicians. Some have no future in the politics of their own country. They have been put out to pasture. Others see their service in Brussels as a springboard back into their own politics. They have been put out to stud.' Kenneth Baker 'Ministers do not have private feelings on things like that.' John Redwood, asked if he loved the council tax 'We thought up a new party slogan over the weekend: new boys do it better without whips.' A Euro-sceptic on the prospect of a three-line whip over Maastricht 'No]' Resounding response from delegates when Lord Tebbit asked: 'Do you want to be citizens of a European union?'</p>

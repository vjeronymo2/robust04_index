			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: Top to bottom cover - Douglas Deakin Young / 13th in a series on fee-based advisers The firm of Douglas Deakin Young is no recent convert to fee-based financial advice. DDY was founded in 1975 by George Douglas, James Deakin and Louise Botting - now its chairman - and has always done business on a fees-only basis. But DDY is rather different from most firms of independent financial advisers (IFAs). It concentrated initially on providing independent advice to the directors and employees of large corporations. Managing director Alan Warner recalls: 'In those days, we specialised in executive financial planning, which was extended to the shop floor when it came to redundancies.' As one example, DDY advisers counselled 450 staff individually when Associated Newspapers first closed the London Evening News in 1980. Today, DDY has a glittering corporate client list which includes Argyll Group, Courtaulds, IPC, Littlewoods, Rank Xerox and the English National Opera. In addition, there are more than 750 private clients. Some went to DDY through a corporate contact, others via personal recommendation. DDY provides comprehensive financial planning and will also deal with tax affairs. 'The one area where we are not competent is in legal matters,' says Warner, who trained as a accountant with Touche Ross. 'Say a client was going to the Channel Islands - we would double-check his plans with a firm of solicitors.' DDY's fees range from Pounds 75 to Pounds 165 an hour and private clients are billed in advance. New clients are seen at the firm's office in London's Piccadilly - heart of the West End - and their initial half-hour interview is free. Because DDY handles client money, over recent years it has laid emphasis on developing its investment management side. It offers a choice of three services. The discretionary service has an 0.5 per cent annual management fee; the nominee advisory service costs 0.2 per cent a year, plus broker's commission; and the own-name portfolio management service costs Pounds 360 a year. The nominee advisory service, where clients are consulted before any action is taken, has proved to be the most popular option. All clients, no matter the service, are contacted at least twice a year and each has a named adviser. 'People often say that one of the things they like about us is that they are dealing with the same person,' says Warner. The house investment style is cautious. If Warner is using pooled vehicles, he prefers investment trusts to unit trusts as he believes the latter have become too expensive. 'Some clients want all equities and others want no risk and have very large contingency funds,' says Warner. 'As with any investment, the client comes first. But if you took the average client - in his 50s or just retired - for sums below Pounds 100,000, we will look to have a good 60 per cent in risk-free assets. We will go up to 60 per cent in equities if clients have more than Pounds 100,000.' DDY has more than Pounds 100m under management and Warner believes this can be a spring-board for further expansion. 'I would like to see our investment management side built up, now that we have got critical mass,' he says. 'I would like Pounds 250m under management. 'The point about funds under management is that you have got a stable business. With a consultancy practice, business comes and goes.' He stresses, however, there will be no rush for growth at DDY. 'In the past, we have tried diversification into mortgages and our own business expansion scheme, with no success. 'I believe in concentrating on what we think we are good at - which is investment management, financial planning and redundancy counselling. This is a very labour-intensive and personal business, and I think it is the kind of service that is best provided by a relatively small organisation.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                        THE INDEPENDENTS  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Name of financial adviser:         Douglas Deakin Young Ltd  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Address of head office:            Empire House,                                    175 Piccadilly,                                    London W1V 9DB  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Date firm was established:         1975  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Regulator:                         Fimbra  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Funds under management:            Pounds 100m plus  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Number of clients:                 750 private clients  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Number of offices:                 One  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Minimum investment accepted:       No minimum  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Services offered:                  Investment management,                                    financial planning, tax returns  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Fees:                              Pounds 75 to Pounds 165 an hour  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> December 20, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD  </P> <P> John Robinson-and-the-Rams is beginning to sound like Pat Riley-and-the-Lakers  and you know how that turned out. . . .  </P> <P> Agent Leigh Steinberg is getting calls from clients about another kind of  draft. . . .  </P> <P> "Many of them are concerned about the armed services draft being reinstated  because of the Middle East crisis," Steinberg said. "Actually, a lot of players  could pass NFL team physicals, but not U.S. Army physicals. And some would be  too big for the height and weight limitations." . . .  </P> <P> A client of Steinberg who is having his best season, Warren Moon, is in line to  receive a bonus from the Houston Oilers that would exceed $1 million. . . .  </P> <P> Moon is second behind injured Jim Kelly in the NFL quarterback ratings. If he  finishes in the top three or the Oilers reach the Super Bowl, he will be paid  the average salary of the three-highest paid quarterbacks -- Joe Montana,  Randall Cunningham and Kelly. That average is $3.25 million. Moon is working on  a five-year, $10-million contract. . . .  </P> <P> After throwing for 527 yards against Kansas City and missing Norm Van  Brocklin's NFL record by only 27 yards, Moon told Steinberg: "With this  offense, don't worry. We'll get the record sooner or later." . . .  </P> <P> Look for a large number of juniors to opt for the NFL draft because a  collective bargaining agreement could be reached before the 1992 season and  lower the salary of rookies. . . .  </P> <P> Six-foot-eight Dan McGwire's stock would rise even more if the NFL eliminated  the in-the-grasp rule. . . .  </P> <P> When Sam Jankovich moves from the University of Miami to New England, he will  discover that the Hurricanes recruit a lot better than the Patriots. . . .  </P> <P> With Phil Simms down, Giant Coach Bill Parcells has run out of excuses for not  opening up his offense. . . .  </P> <P> You may remember new Angel TV announcer Ken Wilson from his ESPN days. . . .  </P> <P> Two of USC's four Heisman Trophy winners, Mike Garrett and Charles White, are  working for the university. . . .  </P> <P> Garrett replaces former NFL defensive back Mike Reinfeldt, who has become chief  financial officer for the Green Bay Packers after building a solid reputation  in the Trojan and Raider business departments. . . .  </P> <P> I assume Augusta will wear green warmup jackets before taking on USC at the  Sports Arena Saturday. . . .  </P> <P> For the second consecutive year, four of the six safeties voted into the Pro  Bowl game are from USC. . . .  </P> <P> Brett Salisbury should prove to be a worthy successor to quarterback Bill  Musgrave at Oregon. . . .  </P> <P> Ben Johnson's former coach, Charlie Francis, says Johnson is in 10.0, 100-meter  shape. Johnson, who will run half that distance in the Sunkist meet Jan. 18 at  the Sports Arena, was clocked at 9.79 at Seoul. . . .  </P> <P> New Jersey fans boo every time a Toronto goal shows up on the out-of-town  scoreboard at the Meadowlands because the Devils have the Maple Leafs' first  draft pick in the year of Eric Lindros. . . .  </P> <P> I still can't fully enjoy Indiana basketball telecasts from Bloomington because  of the terrible camera angles. . . .  </P> <P> News item: LSU's Shaquille O'Neal scores 53 points against Arkansas State.  Reaction: He might be good enough to score 53 against Arkansas. . . .  </P> <P> John Thompson loves to relax by playing the slot machines, which is one reason  why he's bringing Georgetown to Las Vegas to face Ohio State Saturday. . . .  </P> <P> At crunch time, the New York Knicks go only to Patrick Ewing. Most good teams  rely on at least two players, including a small forward. . . . The Clippers are  the only established NBA team with a losing record against the last four  expansion franchises. They are 10-11 against Minnesota, Orlando, Charlotte and  Miami. . . .  </P> <P> Denis Potvin, Larry Robinson and Paul Coffey may have more assists, but don't  even suggest that Bobby Orr isn't the greatest offensive defenseman ever to  play hockey. . . . Sugar Ray Leonard, who challenges World Boxing Council  junior-middleweight champion Terry Norris Feb. 9 at Madison Square Garden, got  knocked down in a sparring session the other day. Usually, that doesn't mean  much, but the same thing happened to Mike Tyson before he was flattened by  Buster Douglas. . . .  </P> <P> Best shootout -- and rebounding duel -- in Texas is Akeem Olajuwon vs. David  Robinson. . . .  </P> <P> During Mike Dunleavy's slow start with the Lakers, owner Jerry Buss dropped  into the coach's office and offered his encouragement. . . .  </P> <P> The short list of prospective National League expansion franchises will never  be short enough for me.  </P></p>

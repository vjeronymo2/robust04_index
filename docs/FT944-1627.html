			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / FT Guide to the Week: Measures coming into effect on January 1 1995 The World Trade Organisation, the successor to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, is launched. Gatt will continue for a one-year transition period. Mercosur: A customs union comprising Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and Paraguay is due to come into being. It may develop into the nucleus of a South American Free Trade Area. Andean Pact countries, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela, enter into their own free trade agreement. Japan initiates a partial opening of its rice market, allowing 4 per cent of consumption to be supplied by imports. European security: The Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE), which comprises all European and Commonwealth of Independent States countries and the US and Canada, changes its name to Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). This is part of an effort to upgrade the body into an umbrella organisation for European security. European Union expands: Austria, Finland and Sweden join. The Union's territory will grow by a third, its population by 6 per cent and its GDP by 7 per cent. Norway's voters rejected membership in a referendum in November. Austria, being rich, will have to contribute some Sch30bn (Dollars 2.7bn) to the EU's coffers this year, aggravating a budget deficit of 5 per cent of GDP. About a third of the money comes back as adjustment payments to farmers because the Common Agricultural Policy takes immediate effect. Consumers are the big winners, not only on food prices, but also on many service costs where protectionist walls must come down. The Austrian National Bank is joining the European Monetary System immediately and will probably join the Exchange Rate Mechanism in short order. The schilling is rigidly pegged to the D-mark, so these moves will have no noticeable effect. Sweden and Finland, neutral Nordic neighbours who kept their distance from western Europe during the Cold War, step into the Union hoping membership will consolidate their recovery from deep recession. Both will become net contributors to the budget; consumers should benefit from lower food prices as trade barriers fall, but Finland's highly subsidised farmers are braced for a painful adjustment to the EU's lower farm prices. Both countries are signing up for the EMS, but intend to float their currencies for the time being. France takes over the rotating six-month presidency of the European Union from Germany against the background of campaigning for domestic presidential elections due in May. Free-trade agreements between the EU and the three Baltic republics, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, are due to come into effect. They are a first step towards eventual accession. European Medicines Evaluation Agency opens shop in London. A pharmaceuticals licensing body for medicines marketed in more than one European Union country, it should streamline drug approvals. Euro-gobbledygook: Britain's Plain English Campaign, which crusades against obscure bureaucratic language, has said it will turn its attention to Brussels-speak. Its Inside Write campaign is to monitor internal publications. Germany's second Financial Markets Promotion Act, the legislative mainstay of a project to bring Finanzplatz Deutschland up to international standards in areas such as regulation and supervision, comes into force. Centrepiece is a ban on insider trading with five years' jail as the maximum punishment. First victims of the legislation have been the traditional 'fireside chats'  -informal pre-Christmas meetings between management and hand-picked journalists at which sensitive full-year results data were formerly dished out as liberally as the beer and sausages. Cost of unity: German taxpayers face a 7.5 per cent solidarity surcharge on income tax to help pay for the integration of former East Germany into the country. UK employers' liability insurance policies, which provide cover against workplace deaths and injuries, renewed from today will no longer offer unlimited cover. Insurance companies have imposed a basic claims limit of Pounds 10m. UK commission disclosure: Under a new regime imposed by City regulators, life insurance and pensions sales agents and advisers will have to give customers more information about the policies they sell and the costs of selling them. Last gasp: Australia extends its anti-smoking provisions. There will be a ban on advertising smoking materials, except limited point of sale material, and on the use of brand names for promotional purposes. Packaging must bear larger health warnings. The US's Delta Airlines begins a smoking ban on all its flights. Century of cinema: The cinema has decided to declare 1995 its 100th birthday in a year-long celebration around the globe. Paris in December 1895 saw the first audience buy tickets for the first public moving picture show in a disused ballroom.</p>

Sidelnikov, identified by caption; figures in brackets  denote broadcast time in GMT in hours, minutes, and seconds]    [Text] [060846] [Korovkin over shot of industrial  plant exterior] According to information from the Ministry  of the Environment, one-half of Russians drink substandard  water, while one-third are subjected to the effects of harmful  waste from enterprises with a concentration of toxic substances  10 times higher than the acceptable limit. At the same time,  identifying the sources of the pollution and, most importantly,  defining its toxicity and measuring the quantity of harmful  waste was, until recently, a highly complex and difficult  technical task. This problem has been successfully solved in  the analytical laboratory of Russia's Military Academy for  Chemical Protection,. A unique method of monitoring the  environment using lasers has been developed here.    A. Zhitov: [Laboratory chief, identified by  caption] The originality of this development resides in the  fact that this is in point of fact the first time that it has  been possible to obtain spectral forms of the biological and  chemical composition of aerosols. And in this way, on the basis  of the said method, it is possible to develop universal remote  laser systems for monitoring air pollution.    Korovkin: The military industry has already  developed and indeed produces the remote chemical reconnaissance  device ``Dal'' which, according to the designers themselves, can  be employed for ecological monitoring purposes almost without  any modifications or additions. Moreover, experts estimate that  two ``Dal'' devices can monitor an area the size of Moscow.  [Video shows scenes from laboratory, equipment, graphs,  designs, ``Dal'' system] [061007]</p>

(2:30)  </P> <P> Rain Man (HBO Sunday at 10 p.m.): It was Dustin Hoffman who won the Oscar for  his performance as an autistic middle-aged man, but it's Tom Cruise, as his  much-younger brother who carries the 1988 picture as a wheeler-dealer  transformed during a cross-country trip with Hoffman. (2:20)  </P> <P> The Quiet Man (TBS Thursday at 7 p.m.): John Ford's glorious 1952 romantic  comedy is set in Ireland and stars John Wayne as a champion Irish-American  boxer returning to his birthplace and beguiled by fiery Maureen O'Hara, whose  red-haired beauty was perfect for Technicolor. (2:30)  </P> <P> M (Channel 28 Friday at 11:10 p.m.): Fritz Lang's 1931 masterpiece stars Peter  Lorre as a tormented, compulsive child killer who becomes the target of an  underworld fed up with being hounded by the police.

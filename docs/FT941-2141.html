			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Survey of Management Education &amp; Training (1): A case study in change - A less certain economic environment has increased business demand for management education. Competition is becoming much fiercer, however, as rival institutions vie to offer the formula for success Leading management educationalists spend a lot of time these days telling companies how to cope with change. Ironically, the turmoil and uncertainty in their own business provides ample material for a good case study. Like other sectors, business schools in Europe and North America have been hard hit by recession. The problem, though, has not merely been adjusting to a cyclical pattern of demand. Teaching content and styles, traditional delivery methods, and even the very basis for schools' existence have all been thrown under the spotlight by the quickening pace of economic and technological change. Among trends on both sides of the Atlantic several stand out: a sharper focus on immediate corporate concerns (as manifested in the growth of short executive courses tailor-made for individual companies); increasing emphasis on the so called multidisciplinary - as opposed to functional - teaching approach; and growing interest in international issues. In striving to find the right formula for survival in the 21st century - which in Europe means finding an appropriate model for training the new breed of Euro-manager - business schools are locked in an urgent struggle for students, staff, money and other scarce resources. Management education only became a respectable and established academic discipline in the US in the late 1950s - but its expansion over the last three decades is a remarkable success story. The US method has been widely exported, in the process influencing the development of regional systems such as that in Europe. The contribution of business school research has been acknowledged in the award of at least four Nobel prizes for economics to business school professors. Suddenly, however, a discipline renowned for its interpretation of relatively predictable long term business trends is being asked to provide instant solutions for companies in a much faster and less certain economic environment. The good news is that even if its nature is changing, demand for management education is probably as great (if not greater) than ever. Annual company spending on executive education in the US, for instance, is estimated to have doubled from Dollars 2bn to Dollars 4bn between 1987 and 1992. In Europe, the UK's Ashridge Management College last year conducted interviews with 150 large and medium sized companies in Britain, Germany, Scandinavia and the Benelux countries, which found that 80 per cent of them were actively involved in management development, 66 per cent had recently increased their investment, and 50 per cent predicted a further rise in spending. Intensifying competitive pressures, organisational restructuring, integrating strategy and development, and recognition of the value of management education as a competitive weapon were among reasons cited by respondents. But if the cake is not necessarily shrinking, getting a slice of it has become much tougher. The corporate sector's concern with immediate problems has blurred the boundaries between management education and consultancy - creating new competition from (among others) big management consultancies, trade associations and redundant executives. Business schools have had to re-think their strategies radically. The soul-searching takes slightly different forms in Europe and North America, but Professor George Bain, principal of the London Business School, believes the challenges on both sides of the Atlantic can be summarised in the four 'I's' - Internationalisation, Integration, Implementation and Innovation. Internationalisation is reflected in the growth of foreign students on MBA courses, and in attempts to broaden faculty recruitment, diversify teaching materials, and promote a greater number of exchange programmes. Integration is seen in the way schools have been trying to move away from the vertical curriculum 'silos' - accounting, marketing, finance and the like - and to replace, or at least supplement, them with course structures that encourage a more holistic approach to problem solving, thereby better reflecting the real world. Implementation is a reaction to old jibes that MBA really stands for management by analysis or management by academics. Thus skills courses, team building, business ethics, negotiation and, above all, leadership have become features of the modern management education curriculum. Innovation, the last of the Is, implies that the static model of the golden age is nowadays in constant need of revision and fine tuning. The encouraging thing from a European point of view - not least amid renewed fears about Eurosclerosis - is that Europe's management education suppliers may be better placed to make the necessary adaptations than their US counterparts. London, Fontainebleau-based Insead, and IMD in Lausanne, Switzerland, for example, have long been more international than even the top US establishments (and certainly more so than the Mid-Western school whose Dean not so very long ago proposed that schools' international credentials should be measured by the number of faculty holding passports). North America's strong research tradition, moreover, is thought by many to have hampered the development of a true interdisciplinary approach, while the rich endowments often provided by alumni have encouraged some to remain unwisely detached from employers. Instead, IMD, London and IESE (Barcelona), on the other hand, have long received 50 per cent of their income, or more, from executive as opposed to MBA programmes. The proportion from this activity at most leading US schools is still less than 10 per cent. The immediate strains on business schools in the UK and continental Europe, nevertheless, are real enough. The proportion of funds which they can obtain from the public sector in Britain and France is falling, while the trend away from open executive programmes, attended by managers from many companies, towards shorter company-specific courses has financial implications. Single-sourcing, moreover, or at least reducing the number of suppliers, is happening as much in the management education sector as it is in others, says Mr Martin Christopher, deputy director, executive development, of Cranfield School of Management which has an annual turnover of Pounds 6.3m from short courses alone. 'The competition is very tough'. Lower salary expectations and the uncertain jobs market have combined to cut demand for full time MBA courses by roughly 15 per cent over the last two to three years - though latest figures from the Association of MBAs (Amba) suggest that 1993/94 has seen a recovery in the UK. The growth in part-time programmes is a welcome extension of choice, but some courses are of poor quality and middle-ranking schools in particular are being squeezed. The management challenge for business school deans goes well beyond merely balancing the budget. The test is finding faculty able to respond to the growing demand for teaching across disciplines, sufficiently versed in international issues, and with the right skills to address companies' immediate problem-solving needs. The trick is to do this without sacrificing schools' research capability, and without losing the leading-edge knowledge which distinguishes management education from management consultancy. To use a piece of jargon from the latter's lexicon, the successful schools of the next century will have rightsized rather than downsized. Cutting human capital is a last resort for many businesses at the moment, but business schools are especially reluctant not just because their brains are their biggest asset but because a well rounded faculty is not easily re-assembled. This in part explains the intense interest in training managers in emerging markets like those of Eastern Europe, India and even the Far East. A business school's most precious - but at the same time most costly - resource is the brains of its faculty. Perhaps the most interesting tussle is what Jean-Pierre Nioche, a Professor at the HEC-ISA School of Management, has called the war of educational standards within Europe. At issue is whether the imported post-experience MBA model - so influential in many ways already - will win out, or whether a new European model is emerging for the single market. It must not be forgotten that despite the MBA's high profile he or she is in a minority in Europe in terms of both new graduates and industrial leaders, particularly in France and Germany. Broadly speaking, institutions in most European countries apart from Britain offer degrees leading to a qualification acknowledged by many to be of masters level, and often including on-the-job experience. In France there are also the grandes ecoles of management (discussed elsewhere in this survey), independent of the universities and offering five year programmes with a more business-oriented vocational focus. Both UK and continental institutions increasingly offer exchange or placement opportunities under the Erasmus or Comett programmes. More than 15,000 management students will have spent periods of more than three months abroad at partner institutions in 1993/94. Thus, there is no shortage of well-qualified European students with good linguistic skills and solid professional experience. The challenge is to make these masters level qualifications as tradeable across frontiers as a good quality MBA - either through mutual recognition, or, more ambitiously, through the development of a common curriculum. This is the mission of networks, such as the Community of European Management Schools and the Alliance of Management Schools in European Capitals, as well as of multi-site programmes such as the European Partnership of Business Schools, the Ecole Europeenne des Affaires, and the European Business School. The extent to which existing programmes satisfy the criteria for a European qualification is also the subject of a European Commission study being undertaken at the moment by Lancaster University. Between them, Brussels and the market place can no doubt supply some answers.</p>

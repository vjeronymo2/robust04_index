"One should not expect from it better  relations and tranquility. On the contrary, the seeds of  discord and suspicion have been planted", Gorbachev believes.    Initially, there was the issue on an early admission to NATO  of new members, but, seeing Russia's disapproval of this  possibility, the North Atlantic Alliance "resorted to  maneuvering and devised the `Partnership for Peace' initiative."  It's clear that NATO has, in fact, not given up the idea of  expanding the bloc, he remarked.    In Gorbachev's words, "it turns out that in U.S" Russia "is  suspected of threatening its neighbors." "That's merely an  insult to the people of Russia", the ex president said.    In his opinion, a positive response to the concept from  Russia's president and government at the recent NATO summit  Brussels testifies to the absence of an integral home and  foreign policy concept in Moscow.</p>

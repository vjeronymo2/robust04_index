			<p><P> January 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOTEBOOK: CHEF'S RULE FOR REWRITING MENUS: DON'T  </P> <P> Patrick Healy, chef and co-owner of the justly popular Champagne in West Los  Angeles, called the other day to chat about something that's been bothering him  -- a tendency on the part of some of his customers to want to rewrite his  menus. They want a sauce he has created for one dish applied to another, for  instance, or they ask to shuffle accompaniments around, as if every single item  mentioned were a la carte, and it were each client's responsibility to arrange  them so that they made sense.  </P> <P> Now, Healy is well-known in the local restaurant community as a pleasant and  reasonable young man. He is not at all, in other words, one of those  egos-at-high-boil that run some kitchens hereabouts. And indeed, he is quick to  stress, he accommodates his customers whenever possible. "But I think people  should realize," he says, "that wanting to change everything around is  something that has always killed chefs who spend a long time working on their  menus, trying to match sauces, vegetables, and so on. I'll always serve a sauce  on the side or hold it altogether, but we get some very strange requests  sometimes, like people wanting a sauce for meat put on their fish. I can't  change things around for everybody, because once I start, I'd never be able to  stop." There are three big problems here, Healy admits: "My professional pride,  my sense of judgement about food and just plain time."  </P> <P> Having noted Healy's plaint, I'd be interested to hear more opinions on the  subject -- from chefs and customers alike.  </P> <P> CHECKERS MATE: Elka Gilmore, former chef at Camelions in Santa Monica and  chef/proprietor of the now-defunct Tumbleweed in Beverly Hills, has been named  executive chef at the Ayala Hotel group's new Checkers, a luxury hostelry due  to open in March, downtown, on Grand Avenue between 5th and 6th streets (on the  site of the old Mayflower Hotel).  </P> <P> Meanwhile, at Ayala's flagship property, Campton Place in San Francisco, Jan  Birnbaum moves into the executive chef's office -- replacing Bradley Ogden, who  is leaving to open his own restaurant. Birnbaum, who has been working under  Ogden, is a veteran of three of the country's best restaurants -- the  Rattlesnake Club in Denver, the Quilted Giraffe in New York, and Paul  Prudhomme's K-Paul's in New Orleans. Birnbaum takes over officially on February  15, though Ayala president Bill Wilkinson adds, "We expect that Bradley will be  around helping us here and there throughout the end of March."  </P> <P> EAST MEETS WEST: Speaking of chefs who have moved, our own Roy Yamaguchi,  formerly of 385 North, will open his new restaurant, Roy's, on Jan. 28 in  Honolulu. Local talent is also responsible for the look: the L.A. firm  Grinstein-Daniels (designers of Chaya Brasserie) designed the new restaurant.  Says Yamaguchi, who is known for his combinations of Asian and European  cooking: "The Islands are where East meets West. I think we were made for each  other."  </P> <P> TABLE TALK: Chopstix, on Melrose Avenue, which describes itself as "Southern  California's hottest grazing spot" (and who can argue?), has opened a second  location in Sherman Oaks at the La Reina Center. . . . The Epicurean Cooking  School in West Hollywood offers classes with two noted Bay Area chefs this  month: Paul Bertolli, chef at Chez Panisse (and author of the new book "Chez  Panisse Cooking") on Wednesday, Jan. 18 at 6:30 p.m. ($75 per person); and  Hubert Keller of Fleur de Lys on Wednesday, Jan. 25, also at 6:30 p.m. (and  also $75 a head). Information: (213) 659-5990. . . . And La Chaumiere in the  Century Plaza Hotel features a special wild game and truffle menu at dinner (in  addition to the regular menu), through the end of February. Information: (213)  551-3360.  </P></p>

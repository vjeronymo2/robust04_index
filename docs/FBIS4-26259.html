			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Chen Yongping (7115 3057 1627), Yu Jie (0060 </F> 2638), Wang Qing (3769 7230): "Wage Arduous Struggle, Open Up  and Keep Forging Ahead, Ensure the Fulfillment of the `3-7  Specific Plan for Helping the Poor'"]    [Excerpts] Wang Qun, secretary of the autonomous regional  party committee, delivered a speech at the regional work  conference on helping the poor to achieve development on 6 June,  in which he pointed out: It is very important for the region to  fulfill the "3-7" plan for dealing with the problems encountered  by 30 million poor people throughout the region with regard to  dressing warmly and eating their fill during the seven years  before the end of this century. Therefore, we must adhere to  the theory of Comrade Deng Xiaoping with regard to building  socialism with Chinese characteristics and to the party's basic  line, be based on reality, fulfill the plan on schedule and  without fail, and win a victory in handling the knotty problems.    Attending yesterday's conference were leading personnel from  the regional level organs, including Qian Fenyong, Bai Enpei,  Liu Zhen, Zhang Tingwu, Yang Zizhen, and Alatanaoqier.    In his speech Wang Qun pointed out: The "8-7" plan  formulated by the CPC Central Committee and the State Council  for helping 80 million poor people throughout the country deal  with their problems of dressing warmly and eating their fill  during the seven years before the end of this century has a  bearing on the whole situation. It is a big event that has a  bearing on the interests of China and the Chinese nation. Over  the past half century, the CPC has experienced countless  complications in leading the people of various nationalities  across the country and also scored great achievements attracting  worldwide attention. However, there are 80 million people in  the country and 30 million people in the region, who are still  in poverty status. This warrants leadership at all levels  meditate. In this sense, fulfilling the "8-7" specific plan  marks a great historical change in which China and Chinese  nation have thereupon cast off the poverty and entered a  brand-new, wealthy, civilized, and developed period. Only by  thoroughly casting off poverty can we eloquently prove that  poverty and polarization do not belong to socialism. Only  commonly becoming wealthy represents the socialism with Chinese  characteristics and can prove that the CPC is completely and  thoroughly working for the happiness and interest of the vast  majority. Wang Qun pointed out: We should implement the spirit  of directive given by Comrade Jiang Zemin with regard to  "thinking of new ways in helping the poor." Specific measures  adopted by the region in fulfilling its "3-7" plan chiefly are  as follows:    1. It is imperative to foster the viewpoints of the market  economy in helping the poor by handling the knotty problems.  The establishment of systems of socialist market economy has  brought about an excellent opportunity of development to the  poor localities. The volume of demands raised by both vast  domestic and foreign markets to the professions of planting and  raising and to the industries of natural resources has become  increasingly large. This is just a good opportunity for the poor  localities to vigorously carry out their plans. We must renew  our concepts and accelerate the development of the large-scale  commodity economy. We cannot become wealthy by engaging in the  production of petty commodities and will certainly be rich by  engaging in the production of important ones.    2. We must first help the poor foster their confidence while  giving support to them. We should direct the poor localities  and households to wage an arduous struggle, to be self-reliant,  to define their own goal in line with their reality, and to be  determined to cast off poverty and become wealthy.    3. In helping the poor by handling the knotty problems, we  should be based on deepening the reform in rural and pastoral  areas. According to the market law, a good job should be done  in readjusting the industrial structure and product mix of rural  and pastoral areas. First, we should stabilize the household  responsibility system linked with their output of rural and  pastoral areas. Based on this foundation, we should establish  or improve the dual system with the integration between  centralized and decentralized management and gradually expand  the scale of collectively owned economy to enhance the actual  strength of collectives in helping the poor. Efforts should be  made to bring into play the enthusiasm of collectives and poor  households so as to give full expression to the socialist  superiority.    4. In helping the poor by handling the knotty problems, we  must adhere to the principle of supporting the poor in the  course of development. Supporting the poor in the course of  development means that it is necessary to rely on the joint  forces fostered by the state support and the cooperation of the  masses to develop or build the projects of casting off poverty  and becoming wealthy. In view of the autonomous region,  measures to conduct capital construction among farm fields and  pastoral farms and to build the projects of ecological benefits  should be adopted to improve the productive conditions and to  build some proper-scale bases of farm and livestock commodities,  which have stable and high yields as well as high benefits.    5. In helping the poor by handling the knotty problems, we  should concentrate our financial and material resources on  giving priority to dealing with the key problems encountered by  poor localities and households and on creating necessary  conditions for them.    6. In helping the poor by handling the knotty problems, we  should bring political strong points into play. The region has  had a long-standing tradition of unity among the nationalities  and progress, as well as of equality and mutual assistance among  various nationalities. We should carry out the activities of  encouraging the masses to commonly become wealthy, issue the  letter of responsibility to every household, and turn the  activities into the conscious act of the masses.    7. In helping the poor by handling the knotty problems, a  good job should be done in conducting intellectual, scientific,  and technological support. In conducting poverty control, we  must first carry out ignorance control and vigorously conduct  the activities of social education. Efforts should be made to  forcibly make cultural knowledge popular, to popularize science  and technology, and to enable the poor households to obtain one  or several capabilities in technology.    8. Tasks adopted for helping the poor by handling the knotty  problems should be fulfilled within the given date. Leadership  at all levels should integrate without conditions or haggling  the principle of having the people, townships (sumu), banners  (counties) become wealthy with the development of the  banner-county level economy, as well as of township and vanguard  enterprises. They should develop enterprises with various  ownerships and be winners in having markets well in mind and in  casting off poverty.    Lastly Wang Qun stressed: Party committees and governments  at all levels should enhance their leadership over the work.  Principal leading personnel should take personal charge of the  work and leading personnel sharing the tasks in this regard  should earnestly grasp the work. They should strengthen their  services and realistically assume the duties imposed on them by  history. Efforts should be made to establish the systems of  supervision and inspection in this regard and to win a new  victory in deepening the reform, fostering unity and stability,  and making the economy leap forward.    During the work conference, Wu Liji also delivered a speech  in which he pointed out: In fulfilling the region's "3-7" plan  for helping the poor by handling the knotty problems, it is  imperative to achieve in adhering to the following seven  principles:    First, we should adhere to the principle of integrating the  work of dealing with the problems of dressing warmly and eating  one's fill with that of becoming better-off and wealthy.  [passage omitted]    Second, we should adhere to the principle of integrating the  work of helping the poor in the course of development with that  of helping the poor while conducting opening up. [passage  omitted]    Third, we should adhere to the principle of integrating the  work of encouraging the people to become wealthy with that of  encouraging townships, banners, and counties to do so. [passage  omitted]    Fourth, we should adhere to the principle of integrating  economic development with intellectual development. [passage  omitted]    Fifth, we should adhere to the principle of integrating  material production with population growth. [passage omitted]    Sixth, we should adhere to the principle of integrating the  material civilization drive with that of spiritual civilization.  [passage omitted]    Seventh, we should adhere to the principle of integrating  state support with local self-reliance. [passage omitted]</p>

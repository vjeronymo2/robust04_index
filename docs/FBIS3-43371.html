			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Jose de Castro, head of the Mozambique National  Resistance [Renamo] Foreign Affairs Department, has said in  Chimoio that, despite a certain slowness in the confinement of  Renamo troops, the work that has been done so far has been  positive.    Speaking to the media in Chimoio, Jose de Castro said that  the people who complain about Renamo's troop confinement  slowness should rather consider the differences in the general  conditions -- notably transportation -- enjoyed by Renamo and by  the government forces.    The head of the Renamo Foreign Affairs Department also  affirmed that he hopes 1994 will be the year that will (?prove)  both sides share the desire to see true peace restored to the  country.</p>

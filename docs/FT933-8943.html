			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: US imports of CIS aluminium jump THERE WAS a huge increase in US imports of aluminium from the Commonwealth of Independent States in the first quarter of this year, the US Aluminium Association said yesterday. The total jumped from under 16,000 tonnes for the whole of 1992 to nearly 80,000 tonnes in the first three months of this year. Analysts expect the flow to increase at an even greater rate following the European Commission's weekend decision to place short-term restrictions on CIS imports to the Community because of the 'serious damage' being caused to the European aluminium industry. The CIS material is expected to be diverted to other markets. So far the US association, in contrast to other US industries facing foreign competition, has not been asking the government for protection and has even argued against quotas. But Mr Paul O'Neill, chairman of Aluminum Company of America (Alcoa), the world's biggest aluminium producer, hinted on Tuesday that the US industry's stance might change in the light of the EC restrictions. An official pointed out, however, that, because the association had such a wide variety of members, it would not be easy 'to establish an industry position'. The association released the text of a letter it sent to Mr Micky Kantor, the US trade representative, last week just before the EC took its decision to act against the CIS. The letter, signed by Mr David Parker, the association's president, urged 'joint governmental efforts involving the EC, Russia, the US, Canada, Australia and other important aluminium trading countries'. It said: 'What is needed is not protectionism but the establishment by governments of rules of transition which will enable CIS aluminium producers to adapt to the laws of economics, the established world trading system and to implement modern environment, health and safety improvements.' It is understood that, following the association's approach, Mr Rufus Yerxa, deputy US trade representative, made informal contacts about the issue with Sir Leon Brittan, EC external economic affairs commissioner, on Friday, just before the commission decided to impose restrictions. Ironically, imports of CIS aluminium to the US early this year were boosted by US producers buying cheap Russian metal to blend with their own. Most of it was of a quality too low to be sold on the London Metal Exchange.</p>

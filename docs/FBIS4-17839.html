			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Comment by Volodymyr Sumin, chairman of the Association of </F> Ukrainian Lawyers: "Election of Hrynyov, Kudyukin, and Some  Other Newly Elected Deputies Should Be Declared Invalid"]    [Text] Before going down in history (if not into  oblivion), the "old" parliament will laud itself at its last  meeting this evening in a bid to gain moral satisfaction. As to  material satisfaction, each of the people's servants did his  best to get it in accordance with his own efforts and perceived  needs during his time in office. However, in addition to the  barrel loads of praise which the former deputies will  undoubtedly heap upon each other, several urgent matters are  awaiting the deputies. In particular, despite their present  state of relaxation, they will have to confront numerous reports  on violation of the Electoral Law, which they themselves passed.  Specifically, these were cases of elections with only a single  candidate contesting--only one candidate running--in four  districts. In each of them, there were ten or more contenders  running in the first round. Here is how Volodymyr Sumin,  chairman of the Association of Ukrainian Lawyers, comments on  this issue.    [Sumin] Of course, it is strange that certified lawyers from  the Central Election Commission deliberately -- because that's  how it was -- violated the law. Not only does Ivan Yemets, head  of the commission, take the liberty of bending the law, he also  claims that it is absolutely right to do so. The law clearly  states that the elections must be held with more than one  candidate. I agree, somebody can die or withdraw his candidacy.  In this case, however, the next best-rated candidate is  proposed. We are not talking about districts where only one  candidate was put forward -- there were none during this  election. Instead, there were four districts, where one of the  two candidates decided not to run for parliament in the second  round, and so the election was held without an opponent. Our  position is that a repeat election must be called in each of  those districts, and that the "victors" should also participate,  because technically, it is not their fault that they remained  alone in the second round. It is the fault of the commission,  and a repeat election must be held. Thus, the four newly  elected deputies, including Volodymyr Hrynyov, head of the  "Blasko" joint stock company, Pavlo Kudyukin, and others will  have to prove their right to sit in parliament once again.    I hope that the Supreme Council, which will hold its last  meeting on 22 April, will correct the commission and its  chairman's mistake; perhaps, it might even assess the actions of  Ivan Yemets. I feel sorry for Ivan Yemets, who has worked all  his life in the [state] apparatus and became its servant.  Obviously, he performed some function in this apparatus, but no  lawyer can act this way. There is no reason for Ivan Yemets to  charge the Association of Ukrainian Lawyers with interfering in  the election procedure. On the contrary, we helped him with our  analysis and expertise on the violations reported by the people  as well as by parliamentary candidates, and which we also  witnessed ourselves. Analyzing the reaction of the commission  and its head, one gets the feeling that the law was violated to  please someone or something, not because of any lack of  knowledge.</p>

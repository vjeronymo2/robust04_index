			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Observer: Bodyguard Keeping up with the Joneses, continued. For a mere Dollars 45,000 (you supply the car) you can have your very own 'personal security vehicle'. The O'Gara-Hess &amp; Eisenhart Armoring Company, an Ohio-based manufacturer of armoured limousines for VIPs, is offering wraparound lightweight composite armour and plastic-reinforced glass windows for the man in the street worried about car robberies and random violence. The company says its armour will stop bullets from .38 calibre and 9mm handguns and machine pistols - standard street-gear for your average US criminal. Optional add-ons include tyres that keep working when riddled with bullets and an explosion-proof fuel tank. And the joy of it all is that you do not need to modify the engine, brakes or suspension because the weight is kept down by not reinforcing the floor or roof. Doesn't that leave the driver vulnerable? Not at all: 'You only need do the roof to stop snipers up high and the floor from blasts underneath. Those have not been a problem here, yet,' says a spokesman.</p>

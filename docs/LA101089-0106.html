			<p><P> October 10, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCHOOL BUS HIT ON FREEWAY BY TRUCK; 23 HURT  </P> <P> A tractor-trailer rig struck a school bus on the Santa Ana Freeway on Monday  afternoon, touching off a chain-reaction that included another school bus and  two passenger vehicles but causing only minor injuries, authorities said.  </P> <P> Twenty high school students returning home from school in the San Fernando  Valley and three drivers of the involved vehicles were taken to hospitals for  treatment after they complained of various injuries, authorities said.  </P> <P> The driver of the first bus, Connie Huston, 48, was treated for cuts on her  hands suffered when the bus windshield shattered and folded back onto the  steering wheel, California Highway Patrol Officer Mark Weddle said.  </P> <P> The others had X-rays and underwent general examinations, said Dr. David  Wagner, a physician in the emergency room of County-USC Medical Center, where  nine of the injured were taken.  </P> <P> "Some of the students were a little dazed and a little upset. It caught them by  surprise," Wagner said. "But they are handling it pretty well."  </P> <P> Cause of the 4:30 p.m. accident on the southbound Santa Ana Freeway near  Brooklyn Avenue was under investigation,  </P> <P> "There is some indication that there was inattentive driving on the part of the  operator of the tractor-trailer," Weddle said. "Apparently he had diverted his  attention momentarily and when he turned back forward, he saw that the bus  stopped. He tried to brake but there wasn't enough room."  </P> <P> Weddle said the truck driver, Thomas Dalton, 62, of Los Alamos, told officers  he was traveling about 40 m.p.h. when he saw that traffic in front of him had  come to a stop. At the time of impact with the first bus, Dalton's rig was  going at least 30 m.p.h., Weddle said.  </P> <P> "It pushed in the back bumper of the first bus five feet," he said.  </P> <P> Traffic on the freeway was backed up for about two miles, the CHP said.  </P> <P> The buses had picked up students from Taft High School in Woodland Hills and  were bound for drop-off points near Ascot and Hooper elementary schools in  South Los Angeles.  </P></p>

			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / Councils to defy 1.5% pay ceiling TWO Conservative-controlled councils that have opted out of national pay agreements are to breach the government's 1.5 per cent pay ceiling for public-sector workers. South Oxfordshire District Council is likely to pay an extra 3.6 per cent from April and Tandridge District Council in Surrey will increase pay by 4 per cent from January 1. The councils are likely to apply the 1.5 per cent increase in 1994. Both said they agreed on the deals just before last month's Autumn Statement, which signalled the pay curb. Most other councils that have opted out of national pay negotiations over the past few years do not intend to breach the government's ceiling for public-sector workers. Similar decisions are being made by other independent public-sector employers, including National Health Service trusts that are able to negotiate pay locally for new staff. Local Government Chronicle estimates that nine out of 15 local authorities with settlement dates between January and April do not intend to breach the 1.5 per cent limit. The magazine reports in its latest issue that Surrey County Council will join Kent and Buckinghamshire in opting for local pay bargaining. White-collar workers and residential staff will, however, have the option of staying in the national agreement. Other local authorities - especially in the Home Counties where recruitment difficulties are greatest - are considering whether to remain within the system. Conservative-controlled Kent County Council will stick to a 1.5 per cent pay increase for its 14,000 staff. Buckinghamshire County Council is expected to follow suit. Mr John Redwood, the local government minister, has written to all the opted-out councils 'seeking co-operation' at what he described as an extremely difficult time. Breakaway action by organisations such as councils and NHS trusts does not normally indicate lower pay; most want more flexibility and the ability to reward merit. Few NHS trusts have broken away from rates nationally negotiated by the pay review bodies, although they are free to do so for newly recruited staff.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Commentary on Yesterday's Report" by Major General </F> (Retired) Viktor Chudov: "Our Strategists Are Too  Unsophisticated"]    [Text] St. Petersburg -- There have been reports in the  mass media that a joint military exercise is to be held on  Russian territory with the U.S. Armed Forces, involving a  Russian motorized rifle division and a U.S. infantry division.  The purpose of the exercise has not been given.    Yesterday PRAVDA informed readers that Brigade General  Leonard Holder Jr., commander of the U.S. Army's 3d Infantry  Division, had already visited Orenburg. He was involved in  preparing for the tactical exercises which it turns out are to  be held this summer.    Here just a few ideas for starters. Orenburg Oblast has been  announced as the scene of the exercise. The military are aware  that the Totskiy test range, where the now-famous exercise  involving the detonation of an aerial nuclear bomb took place 40  years ago, is the only place in Orenburg Oblast where such an  exercise can be held in the summer until the harvest has been  brought in. In terms of training the Totskiy test range is not  the most convenient for this kind of exercise. But it is the  closest of Russia's test ranges to the Central Asian republics.    It is also well-known that a sizeable Strategic Rocket  Forces  grouping is stationed in Orenburg Oblast and a top headquarters  is stationed in the oblast center. There are also other  installations of military and economic importance in the  southern Urals that are of interest to certain foreign states'  services.    The U.S. infantry division comprises 18,000 personnel, 54 M1  tanks, 200 guns and mortars, nine multiple launchers, 410  antitank guided missiles, 133 armored personnel carriers and  infantry fighting vehicles, 218 helicopters, several thousand  vehicles of various categories and purposes, antiaircraft,  engineering, communications, and other combat and auxiliary  hardware. What is more, the division will be accompanied by a  certain number of interpreters, various advisers, and various  support personnel....    This all has to be accommodated, housed, provided with food,  fuel and lubricants, and other items and pieces of military gear  in accordance with U.S. standards.    A corresponding quantity of supplies will also come with the  division. The Americans do not even pay a social call without  bringing in supplies. And this is no social call....    Plenty of aircraft -- U.S. aircraft, of course -- will be  required to deliver and subsequently provide these forces and  facilities with backup and it will be based at Russian  airfields. Thus, there will be a foreign combined military  formation and a foreign air base with vague rights and duties on  Russian territory, creating a situation with no normative-legal  base.    The scenario and plan for any exercise are formulated on the  basis of the exercise's clearly defined objective. What might  be the purpose of the scheduled exercise, and why is it not  being given?    For Russia the purpose of this kind of exercise is to  rehearse cooperation between the two states' combined formations  in combat operations against an adversary that one state's armed  forces cannot handle alone, in order either to carry out or to  rebuff aggression.    First, Russia has no aggressive intent against any neighbors  near or far, as the country's supreme military-political  leadership has repeatedly stated.    Second, there are no aggressors in the immediate vicinity  of Russia that Russia's Armed Forces could not rebuff  autonomously. Apart from military alliances like NATO, of which  the U.S. Armed Forces form the basis.    A spontaneous exercise to rehearse cooperation between the  armed forces of two states that recently opposed one another is  pointless. So say military theory and military practice. Thus,  for instance, command and control of combat operations includes  the processing and analysis of very varied battle management,  support, and other information. But how is information from  sources that have a totally different informational-linguistic  and concept base and uncoordinated means of conveying  information to be processed and analyzed? Here is how a Russian  specialist describes U.S. Army combat documents: "Combat orders  in the U.S. Army are characterized by their own unique features.  They are formulated in accordance with a definite, unified,  rigorously prescribed format, which is regulated by  corresponding instructions and impossible to understand if you  do not possess a sound knowledge of them."    The Persian Gulf, for instance, effectively saw operations  by  a single military bloc, within which information flow was  formalized and coordinated along with the concept and the  informational-linguistic base, means of conveying information  were coordinated, and conferences, seminars, and dozens of  exercises of various kinds and levels are held every year. But  even there, notwithstanding the pace of combat operations today  and the flow of information, linguistic and other barriers have  arisen in the way of information and it has not proved possible  to overcome these barriers rapidly. We know that the Americans  had to deliver 10,000 personal computers and the appropriate  software to the combat operation zone in order to automate the  process of overcoming these barriers. Nevertheless it did not  prove possible to overcome all the barriers and the commander of  the multinational forces was forced during both defensive and  offensive operations to give all national forces their own area  of combat operations....    However, there is a certain hypothetical situation in which  Russian and U.S. divisions will be able to operate together  without prior preparation. Namely a civil war situation. Is  the country's supreme political leadership not preparing for  that situation by inviting along foreign divisions?    What is the U.S. military-political leadership's objective  in  carrying out this exercise?    Throughout the 20th century the United States has tried to  gain a footing for its armed forces on the continent of Asia. A  tremendous amount of money has been spent and plenty of blood  has been shed, U.S. blood included, but it has only succeeded in  getting hold of a small piece of the Korean Peninsula. That is  why the U.S. side sees it as one of the most important aims of  the scheduled exercise to introduce its armed contingent onto  Russian soil and open up a new theater of combat operations.  The U.S. "Partnership for Peace" concept is for naive fools, a  cover for another U.S. concept -- "Peace U.S.-Style" -- and the  strategy of world domination.    The aim is no simple one and includes a whole series, a  lengthy set of tasks that would take a long time to list.  Although I should do so to enlighten Russian citizens who have  lost interest in military problems over the last 50 years of  peace.    Some of the details of the coming exercise cause suspicion  and doubts among military people who are able to assess events  critically and competently: Is this the main aim being pursued  by the Americans, who are stage-managing events in Russia?    Remember late 1992. A trend toward consolidation developed  in the CIS republics, among not only peoples but also  governments and presidents. Preparations were made for a  summit-level conference and a package of important documents was  made ready for signing.    Then all of a sudden a U.S. President who had had his day  and  was effectively an ex-president challenged the Russian president  to sign the Treaty on Strategic Offensive Arms Reduction -- a  treaty that was still half-baked and in need of considerable  finalization. And our president obediently rushed in, without  squaring his actions with his CIS colleagues or the Russian  Supreme Soviet. He rushed in and signed the treaty, creating a  host of military, economic, and political problems and dealing  an arrogant blow to the ambitions of his fellow presidents and  legislators. The conference did of course go ahead, but the  atmosphere was different and no one has implemented the  documents that were signed. I could go on giving examples of  interference by U.S. stage managers.    A similar situation is developing once again. A wave of  unification sentiments has once again arisen among the peoples  of the former USSR republics.    Do U.S. strategists want that? No! How can it be stopped?  How can they cause chaos? How can separatists and nationalists  be revived and inspired to vigorous activity?    It is hard to think of a better means than an exercise in  the  south of Asian Russia. And if it involves U.S. troops and is  accompanied by certain propaganda details, the reporting of the  exercise as well as the actual fact that it is taking place  could prove extremely heartening for anti-Russian forces.    Russia does not need the planned exercise, and the presence  on Russian territory of any foreign military contingents is  unnecessary and harmful. World practice has seen examples of a  foreign military legion being stationed on the territory of  prostrate and weak states. No one has ever conquered Russia,  and it was not and will not be weak. The Americans do not have  to teach the Russians how to fight.    It is high time that the Russian military department  conducted its own military exercise -- a strategic war game to  repel aggression by a coalition of nuclear powers, to repel a  massive nuclear attack. And all officials whose functional duty  is to take charge of repelling aggression should be involved in  the exercise. That kind of game could establish what the Russian  Armed Forces and their leadership are capable of.    Back in the days of the Union the Russian [as published]  General Staff was so assiduous and spent so long persuading the  Armed Forces, the military public, and military science of the  primacy of politics over strategy that it lost its role and  niche in the system of state governance and turned military  science into the servant of political libertarianism. The  result was that fundamental natural sciences -- mathematics,  physics, cybernetics, etc -- were not called for in resolving  military-strategic problems. That is why the present  spontaneous attempts to set up research directorates and centers  under and within the General Staff in imitation of the foremost  capitalist states are rather reminiscent of the efforts of the  monkey in I.A. Krylov's fable who tried to improve his  age-impaired vision. That is why it is at the very least naive  to rely on the General Staff and military science to conduct an  exhaustive and systematic analysis of Russia's geostrategic  position. The only feasible option in the current situation is  a real-life war game [naturnoye modelirovaniye igri], staff and  command-staff exercises -- unilateral, bilateral, and trilateral  -- extensively involving staffs and outlining the actions to be  taken by troops from all categories of the Russian Armed Forces.    Were the Russian Defense Ministry to organize and carry out  that kind of game, it would help clear up many problems of the  Russian state's security.    But the Russian Defense Ministry's refusal to carry out this  kind of game is also a result which clarifies the stance  espoused by the top brass.</p>

Here is Marta Rojas  with her report.    [Begin recording] [Rojas] Today, Tuesday, the largest  military operation against guerrillas taking place in Arauca  Department was stepped up. The operation, with the support of  the Army Special Forces Command, seeks, among other things, to  curb the political power of the guerrilla groups.    [Fourth Division Commander General Carlos Gil, identified by  caption] According to the intelligence we had, the rebels  planned to take over Fortul and Tame, as a preamble to the  elections the country is preparing for.    [Rojas] The offensive covers the towns of Tame, Fortul,  Saravena, and Arauquita. Four dead soldiers and 14 wounded were  evacuated from the zone. The troops are trying to confirm the  existence of a mass grave in La Paz area, where at least 10  guerrillas were reportedly buried. According to intelligence  information from the Administrative Department of Security, 22  guerrillas were wounded, 11 of whom were reportedly killed, in  the penultimate clash in Fortul.    [Gil] We are saying those who were wounded must receive  medical care, within the framework of humanitarian international  law, provided the care is administered under military control.    [Rojas] The army controls the roads now. Intense air  operations, including the mobilization of over 100 OV-10  helicopters and an Army Special Forces command unit, seek to  counter the actions of four Revolutionary Armed Forces of  Colombia fronts active in Arauca.

			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / Workshare idea splits France THE French Senate is to vote today on an experimental state aid plan for companies that reduce regular working hours in order to take on more employees. The controversial plan gained surprise support this week from Mr Michel Giraud, the labour minister, despite the divisions it has caused in the government and in parliament. If the plan wins approval, it will return to the National Assembly which last month rejected a similar amendment calling for a conditional reduction from 39 to 32 hours in the legal working week in France. The idea of spreading available work around more people was first canvassed by a number of Socialist leaders in last March's elections. Mr Giraud's offer this week to exempt companies from some social welfare charges for three years is conditional on managers agreeing to reduce their working week by at least 15 per cent and increase their workforce by 10 per cent, and on employees agreeing to take a pay cut. The work-share plan cuts right across party lines. It has drawn opposition from economic liberals like Mr Alain Madelin, minister responsible for small business and Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing, leader of the UDF party in the government coalition, who argue that it is just a way of 'sharing unemployment', as well as left-wing Socialists and Communists who want the working week cut from a maximum 39 hours to 35, without any compensating pay cut. But it has backing from Mr Michel Rocard, the Socialist leader, President Mitterrand, and growing support from within the RPR Gaullist party.</p>

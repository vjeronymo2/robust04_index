			<p><P> April 12, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GUARD SURRENDERS IN CASE TIED TO DRUG MONEY PLOT  </P> <P> A former security guard for a Westlake Village stock brokerage firm surrendered  Tuesday to federal authorities, who allege that he helped launder $300,000 from  undercover agents who had described the money as coming from Colombian cocaine  sales.  </P> <P> Darryl Nakatsuka of Los Angeles -- portrayed by FBI agents as a "bag man" in a  money-laundering operation allegedly orchestrated by prominent San Diego  businessman Richard T. Silberman -- surrendered at U.S. District Court,  accompanied by Los Angeles attorney Robert L. Shapiro.  </P> <P> U.S. Magistrate Roger Curtis McKee allowed Nakatsuka to remain free on a  $200,000 personal surety bond co-signed by his father and secured by a family  home in Los Angeles. Nakatsuka was directed to return to court for a  preliminary hearing April 21.  </P> <P> In a brief interview, Nakatsuka said he was "surprised" when friends called him  Friday night and told him he was being sought by the FBI.  </P> <P> "I was at the office on Friday when I heard," said Nakatsuka. "I didn't know  what to think . . . I really don't know anything about this."  </P> <P> Nakatsuka, who described himself as director of security for Hamilton-Williams  and Co. brokerage firm in Westlake Village, said he was acquainted with Jack  Norman Myers, who is among four individuals charged in the alleged  money-laundering scheme and was still at large late Tuesday.  </P> <P> But Nakatsuka declined to comment on his ties to Silberman and the charges  against him.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Silberman -- a leading fund raiser for statewide and local  Democratic candidates and a close adviser to former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. --  resigned Tuesday as director and officer of Yuba Natural Resources Inc., a  mining company with holdings in Northern California. Also, the company's board  of directors formed a special committee to investigate Yuba's involvement in  the alleged scheme.  </P> <P> Silberman, 59, was arrested Friday at a San Diego hotel while allegedly  negotiating to launder $1.1 million in funds an undercover agent told him were  proceeds from Colombian cocaine sales. His arrest capped a 2 1/2-year  investigation by FBI agents who stumbled upon Silberman while trailing reputed  organized crime figure Chris Petti.  </P> <P> Petti, 62, was also arrested Friday. Both he and Silberman -- who is married to  San Diego County Supervisor Susan Golding -- face money laundering charges as  well as charges of violating laws requiring all transactions involving sums  exceeding $10,000 be reported to the federal government. They face a maximum of  20 years in prison if convicted.  </P> <P> A federal affidavit released Monday said Silberman conducted two transactions  with the FBI agent, in November and February, involving a total of $300,000 in  federal money. Prosecutors say wiretapped telephone conversations between  Silberman and the agent make it clear that Silberman believed the money came  from Colombian drug traffickers.  </P> <P> Under federal law, a person need not be laundering actual drug money to be  convicted. Prosecutors say that Silberman needed only to believe its source was  narcotics trafficking to be charged.  </P> <P> The affidavit spells out in intriguing detail the alleged laundering scheme,  which Silberman says in taped conversations that he plotted to have "some  diversification." Silberman stood to earn a commission of between 6% and 12% on  the two transactions.  </P> <P> In meetings with the agent, Silberman repeatedly boasted that he had laundered  money numerous times before, saying, "This is not my first go around. I've been  here before."  </P> <P> Evidence against the powerful political fund raiser, a La Jolla resident whose  wealth was once estimated at $25 million, ranges from extensive transcripts of  wiretapped telephone conversations to videotapes of the cash transactions.  </P> <P> A broker at the Westlake Village office of Hamilton-Williams -- which in March  became a branch of Adams Securities -- said Nakatsuka worked as a security  guard at the company's offices on Triunfo Canyon Road but quit last week.  </P> <P> Terry Ziegler -- another Hamilton-Williams employee alleged to have played a  role in the operation -- was a "part-time analyst" for the company until he  quit last week, said the broker, who declined to give his name. Ziegler has not  been charged.  </P> <P> The affidavit says Ziegler invested $200,000 Silberman obtained from the  undercover agent in zero coupon bonds. Asked to comment on the allegations, the  broker said, "Nothing went through this firm."  </P> <P> An FBI spokesman said Myers was negotiating for his surrender.  </P></p>

			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Republicans want Fed role on inflation to be boosted Senior Republicans yesterday signalled they would seek a radical revision in the US Federal Reserve's legislative mandate, obliging it to put more emphasis on holding down inflation. The Fed's sole goal should be to keep consumer price inflation below 2 per cent, said Senator Connie Mack of Florida, chairman-elect of the influential Joint Economic Committee of Congress. Under existing legislation, the Fed is required to promote full employment and economic growth, as well as stable prices. The Republican proposal followed an oblique warning from Mr Alan Greenspan, Fed chairman, that US short-term interest rates may have to be raised again. Mr Greenspan said the economy was growing faster than expected and expressed concern that financial markets apparently still doubted the Fed's resolve to fight inflation. Testifying before the committee, Mr Greenspan said the present level of US bond prices signalled a widespread expectation that inflation 'will move higher'. He reiterated his determination to prevent this occurring, a commitment interpreted in financial markets as a strong hint that monetary policy will be tightened further. Fed policymakers meet on December 20 to review monetary policy. Consumer price inflation was 'flat or down somewhat compared with last year', Mr Greenspan said, but he warned that prices of intermediate goods were accelerating. Prices of raw commodities had been rising rapidly for nearly two years. He said there was little evidence that US productivity was rising rapidly enough to offset the upward pressure on prices that normally occurs when the economy approaches industrial capacity constraints. Mr Greenspan has long supported a change in the Fed's mandate to make control of inflation its sole objective. Such a change would bring US policy into line with that of many other industrial countries which have set inflation targets for their central banks. He welcomed Senator Mack's proposal but cautioned that setting a specific inflation target might 'create an unnecessary degree of rigidity'. He favoured a general requirement to achieve price stability. Mr Greenspan said the economic outlook remained the best in 20 years. There was little evidence that the pace of economic growth had yet been retarded, despite six increases in short-term rates this year. Bonds, Page 36; Currencies, Page 42; Wall Street, Page 49</p>

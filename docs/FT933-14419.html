			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / International Company News: German steel groups hold tin plate talks THYSSEN STAHL and Krupp-Hoesch Stahl, Germany's two largest steel makers, yesterday confirmed that they were holding talks about co-operation in their tin plate divisions but denied any intention to merge their operations. This follows a report in a Ruhr valley newspaper that the companies might consider merging their tin plate productions to gain economies of scale and reduce costs. Spokesmen from both companies said that talks regarding production, research and development were taking place but described them as routine. Hoesch Stahl, which merged with Krupp Stahl at the beginning of the year, produces annually 300,000 tonnes of tin plate products in its Westfalenhutte plant in Dortmund. Thyssen Stahl's Rasselstein subsidiary in Neuwied, near Koblenz, produces 700,000 tonnes of tin plate products a year.</p>

			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> A PARK IN THEORY  </P> <P> I have been observing the progress of the San Dieguito River Valley Regional  Park with great interest and frustration.  </P> <P> This 43-mile, sea-to-mountain park from Del Mar to Julian is exciting and vital  to preserve some of the stunning natural landscape of lagoon, wetland, valley,  mountain diversity, which is rapidly disappearing.  </P> <P> I hear about the park repeatedly in the press and from political persons as if  it were a reality. However, the park exists only as a proposal.  </P> <P> No land has, as yet, been acquired. Until land is in public ownership, it is  not protected.  </P> <P> The bureaucratic structure for the park is in place. There's the joint powers  authority with representation from the six communities involved; there is a  Citizens Advisory Committee. There is even $10 million available for land  acquisition, but why hasn't it been spent?  </P> <P> Meanwhile land costs escalate, wetlands disappear -- 90% of the wetlands in  California are already gone.  </P> <P> The longer the delay, the higher the cost of acquisition and less will be  purchased with funds available.  </P> <P> Will this be a paper park or the real thing -- and when?  </P> <P> SYLVIA TROY  </P> <P> Del Mar  </P></p>

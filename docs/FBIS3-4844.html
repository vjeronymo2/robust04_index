			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Washington, March 1 KYODO -- The U.S. microchips  industry accused Japan on Tuesday [1 March] of violating a 1991  accord on semiconductor trade and sought an "immediate" remedy  from the U.S. and Japanese Governments.    The Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) said Japan has  violated the 1991 U.S.-Japan Semiconductor Agreement, because  the foreign share of the Japanese microchips market suffered a  "steady decline" last year.    "Consequently, the U.S. Government and the Government of  Japan must immediately consider all actions needed to ensure  compliance," the trade group said in a review of the trade pact.    The report said the 1991 accord calls for a "gradual,  steady"  growth of foreign sales in Japan over a five-year period but the  foreign share dropped 2.1 percentage points in the first three  quarters of last year after hitting 20.2 percent of the Japanese  market in the last quarter of 1992.    "The steady decline in the foreign share of the Japanese  semiconductor market in 1993 violates the 1991 U.S.-Japan  semiconductor and the 1993 U.S.-Japan framework agreement, which  requires full implementation of all existing bilateral trade  agreements," it said.    The association, which represents all U.S. semiconductor  makers, did not say what remedy it seeks from the U.S.  Government.    U.S. charges that Japan violated an earlier version of the  semiconductor pact concluded in 1986 prompted the U.S.  Government to levy trade sanctions against Japan in April 1987.    The foreign share of the Japanese semiconductor market  should  reach at least 25 to 28 percent by 1996 if the trend of growth  in the foreign share that has taken place since 1986 is  maintained over the next four years, the association said.    Despite the 2.1 percentage point fall in the foreign share  of  the Japanese market last year, the association nevertheless  acknowledged that the foreign share showed "significant  progress" in 1993 as a whole over the previous year.    If the foreign share for the fourth quarter of  1993--expected  to be known in mid-March--maintains the average level of the  first three quarters, the foreign share will have averaged about  2.3 percentage points higher in 1993 than in 1992, the report  said.</p>

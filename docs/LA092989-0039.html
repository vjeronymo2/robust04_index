			<p><P> September 29, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Israel formally outlawed the Palestinian Islamic resistance movement Hamas,  clearing the way for prosecution of its jailed founders and tougher action  against Muslim fundamentalists. An Israeli Defense Ministry statement said:  "The Hamas movement, the Muslim Brotherhood's violent arm, which has been  operating under different names in the (occupied) territories, was today  declared illegal in Judea-Samaria (the West Bank), the Gaza district and  Israel." The order makes membership in Hamas and helping the group a criminal  offense.  </P></p>

			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Recruitment: Putting a fence around the workplace - Personnel policies should be central to the overall strategy of a company, but all too often they are not The personnel policies of a company ought to be a vital component of its overall strategy, but all too frequently they are not. This is the main assertion of a fascinating new study on human resource management in British multi-divisional companies. Widespread internal restructuring may be going on across the corporate scene, yet employee relations issues 'are rarely taken into account'. Indeed, as companies introduce more rigorous financial control it becomes more difficult for them to adopt management styles 'based on beliefs about the best way to manage people at work'. 'The influence of personnel management over strategic decisions is limited' and the 'management of employee relations is deemed to be an operational matter wherever it is located,' argues the study. As a result, its authors, Dr John Purcell of Templeton College, Oxford and Dr Bruce Ahlstrand at Trent University, Ontario, argue the corporate institutions and procedures dealing with employees have had to be fitted - often forcibly - into a mould created by change initiated by companies completely outside the industrial relations arena. The authors argue persuasively that not enough attention has been paid to the fact that 'the human resources of particular operating units fail to recognise that these units are often part of a much larger and complex organisational structure'. By constructing a fence around the workplace, human resource management enthusiasts obscure its integral position within the multi-divisional company. Basing their study on nine unnamed companies over a 10-year period, Purcell and Ahlstrand confirm that personnel functions have become isolated from the strategic centre of the enterprise. As a result, personnel managers are uncertain of what their role ought to be within the company and take little part in devising corporate strategy. The book provides a useful and a relatively jargon-free account of how corporate decisions influence human resource management. The authors quote one personnel director who suggests that what drives change in the company is 'the realisation that there is no calm water around the next headland'. Apparently 'it is no longer a case of belt-tightening or taking short-term action to weather a storm'. Instead, there is a need 'to cope with chaos, build for flexibility and find ways of integrating employment relations into the fabric of the organisation'. The authors are right to conclude that while 'remarkably few organisations seriously consider questions of management styles and the most effective way to manage their employees', doing nothing or simply reacting to events is no longer good enough. 'There is a rationale for designing human resource management to add to competitive advantage and economic success,' they argue. Let us hope some companies are listening to this sensible message.

Contracting for IT Growth in the number of skilled staff on short-term contracts of between three and nine months in the information technology sector looks set to become one of the most important trends in the labour market during the current economic recovery. 'New companies are asking for contractors that have never done so in the past', says Mr Tony Coombes, director at Systems Resources, a software and services company which supplies professional services and systems software to corporate customers. 'Large companies have cut to the bone in the IT area during the recession and they are not taking on permanent workers again.' The Coventry-based company has just announced a 58 per cent increase in the number of information technology contract staff taken into employment over the past 12 months to the first week of May to 509, compared with 322 in the previous comparable period. 'One of the reasons for the increase is that contractors can provide the specialist skills that permanent staff do not have, particularly where it would be too costly to retrain them. The company can often get the job done more quickly and more cost-effectively than with permanent staff', argues Coombes. He expects a 50 per cent increase over the next five years in the number of contract workers in information technology to add to the 25,000 currently on the market. 'Employers are reluctant to take on extra permanent staff for projected-based work,' says Coombes. 'Contract staff are a more favourable alternative. Corporate organisations which have felt the consequence of permanent staff reductions over the last two years are now seeing gaps in the development skills they need, to configure the systems they require to remain competitive. The advantages of flexible contract staff is a huge plus for their immediate information technology development.' Science PhD unease British employers are becoming concerned at what they believe to be a fall in the quality of PhD science recruits currently and in the future, according to a new study from the Institute of Manpower Studies in Brighton. But the demand for the 3,500 PhD science graduates who leave British universities every year is unlikely to go up at least until near the end of the decade. The survey suggests 'there is no evidence of a significant trend to a broader recruitment market in general'. Just over a third of the PhD science graduates remain in academic life as researchers or teachers, while 30 per cent go into the private sector, with a large number taking up employment in the oil and chemical industries and in research and development and almost 10 per cent going to the public sector. 'No consistent view emerged from employers about their satisfaction with current PhD training,' suggested the study. But it found that they thought there was need 'for more interpersonal skills training and business awareness' from the PhD intake. Employers also claimed 'more formal training had squeezed out creativity and original thought'. They added they believed PhD science graduates had grown too specialised and lacked 'a breadth of view of their scientific discipline'. The Institute of Manpower Studies indicated that 'the vast majority of employers have little or no demand at all' for PhD science graduates because they did not need people on their pay-rolls with that level of qualification. But the unemployment level for such science graduates remains at less than 3 per cent, considerably lower than for first degree science graduates which stands at over 10 per cent. The survey suggests, however, they are going to have accept much more flexible forms of working in the future with more short-term contracts. It is also clear that PhD science graduates in jobs will have to accept a greater commercialisation of their activities. As one major electronics company told the survey: 'We are now a business first, which does research. We have changed our shape to be more customer focused and now have more worldly skills for commerce and finance. This has meant fewer PhDs and more general all-round skills'.

			<p><P> October 22, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CHURCH, STATE AND SANTA CLARITA  </P> <P> Thank you for the Oct. 2 report by Steve Padilla, "Growth Forces Santa Clarita  Churches Into Odd Venues."  </P> <P> However, Padilla failed to note the very questionable legality of these church  groups being effectively subsidized by the rest of us taxpayers by using public  school facilities for religion. Their violation of the principle of "separation  of church and state" is self-evident!  </P> <P> ALFRED N. PEARL  </P> <P> Van Nuys  </P></p>

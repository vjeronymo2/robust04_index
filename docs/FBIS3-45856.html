To fulfill  these objectives, there is a need to implement nine measures.    The first and foremost is to further emancipate our minds,  change our concepts, and deepen reform. Meng Qingping  particularly stressed the importance of stepping up the reform  of state-owned enterprises. He said: In accordance with the  plan of the State Economic and Trade Commission, this year Hubei  will carry out a five-four-four-one program. Specifically, we  will transform the operational mechanism of 500 large and medium  enterprises; we will select 40 large and medium state  enterprises for the implementation of the regulations on  supervision over state assets and will form a new system under  which the state exercises uniform ownership, the government  exercises graded management, and the enterprise carries out  independent operations; we will select 40 large and medium state  enterprises for the trial establishment of a modern enterprise  system under which government administration is separated from  enterprise management and scientific management is exercised, to  gain experience for the overall implementation of a modern  enterprises system; and, in coordination with the relevant state  department, we will select one city for a reform experiment  which will reduce the enterprises' burdens and improve their  circulating fund rate.    On enterprise reform, Meng Qingping pointed out the need to  make major efforts to adjust the enterprises' organizational  structure. On the one hand, it is necessary to do a good job in  forming enterprise groups; on the other, it is necessary to  promote the merger, reorganization, and combination of  enterprises. In the meantime, a small number of enterprises  that incur losses should be encouraged to announce their  bankruptcy. Attention should also be paid to reforming the  enterprises' operational methods. In the course of ensuring the  taxation contract system's stable transformation into a new  taxation system, it is necessary to increase the momentum of  introducing the enterprise shareholding system, to popularize  the practice of allowing state-owned enterprises to be run by  civilians, and to encourage enterprises with the necessary  conditions to carry out wage system reform and form limited  liability companies or limited shareholding companies.</p>

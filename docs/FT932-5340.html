			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / Tec highlights IT skills shortfall DEMAND NOW outstrips the supply of people with adequate information technology skills according to a survey of employers in London. West London Training and Enterprise Council, which surveyed 719 employers, said the shortfall would get worse unless effective action was taken because the number of people using IT and the number of businesses introducing it were expected to grow. West London Tec said there was a backlog of 50m to 100m man - days of IT training in the UK, and there was 'no clear consensus as to what skills are required, who should have them or how they should be developed'.</p>

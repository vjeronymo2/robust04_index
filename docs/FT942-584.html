			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Rolls-Royce sold Aero engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce was down 6 at 168p after volume of 4.7m as several brokers advised investors to sell the stock. The list of sellers was said to have included SG Warburg and Strauss Turnbull, both believed to have advised investors to switch into British Aerospace. Rolls-Royce had, until recently, been one of the best performing stocks in the market this year. However, a feeling that the shares had run too far ahead emerged in recent sessions. A lacklustre presentation to analysts last week brought a further retreat, with researchers concerned about the rating of the stock and poor order flows, particularly for spares. BAe put on 5 at 450p amid trade of 1m shares. Tobacco to insurance conglomerate BAT Industries rose 17 to 389p on speculation that the company might pull out of a Dollars 1bn deal to buy the cigarette arm of American Brands. The company denied the speculation and a number of experienced market professionals were sceptical. But hopes that the company might have an escape route away from an environment of increasingly tight legislation against the tobacco industry gave comfort to the market. Chemicals group ICI moved forward 14 1/2 to 765p as the company arranged trading update meetings with analysts following its successful presentation last week. Composite insurers recovered sharply with the help of a certain amount of institutional buying. The stocks also responded to a bounce in gilts; most of them hold more than 50 per cent of their investments in the government bond markets. General Accident advanced 16 to 552p and Royal Insurance 10 1/2 to 252p. Cadbury Schweppes, which has underperformed the market by about 11 per cent in the last month, was held back to a rise of only 2 1/2 to 415p as NatWest Securities reiterated its caution on the stock. The house said: 'Whilst Cadbury is keen to reassure the market that profit expectations are still justified, there do seem to be a number of chinks in the armour which justify further caution on the stock.' A UK analysts' visit to some of Grand Metropolitan's US food operations helped the stock harden 4 to 380p as 4.5m shares were dealt. Scottish &amp; Newcastle, which reports figures on Monday, was in demand. The shares appreciated 15 to 517p. NatWest Sec-urities is predicting profits of Pounds 232m. House builder Higgs &amp; Hill fell 4 to 100p after announcing that its Pounds 22.2m rights issue was only a third taken up by shareholders. It said in May that it planned to raise the money to buy house-building land on 13 sites. H&amp;H shares have dropped nearly 25 per cent since the rights announcement, partly reflecting the recent weakness in the sector. In April, housebuilder Redrow Group (off 5 at 108p) scaled back flotation plans in the light of the slack demand. High street retailer Dixons gave up 7 1/2 to 179p, with Goldman Sachs said to be negative on the stock. The group reports figures a week tomorrow. Nervous trading in Vendome ahead of figures due on Friday left the shares 5 off at 449p. Associated British Foods slipped 4 to 501p after investment bank BZW pointed out that the recent decline in UK gilts may soon force brokers to revise profit expectations if there is no recovery. The group has substantial investments in gilts. Tate &amp; Lyle improved 2 to 404p after reassuring the market that its recent purchase of a 61.3 per cent holding in Orsan which received approval from the French, Belgian and German authorities will not dilute earnings per share. Bargain hunters helped engineering group Siebe rally 12 to 528p after its recent dollar induced weakness. Vickers advanced 4 to 175p ahead of an analysts' visit to its Challenger 2 tank factory in Leeds. Motor dealer Lex Service relinquished 8 to 418p, with James Capel said to be negative on the stock. Profit-taking after the recent strong run in Airtours, together with worries of overcapacity in the package holiday market, left the group's shares trailing 15 to 473p. Airtours reported a loss of Pounds 17.6m, in line with market expectations, but analysts upgraded profit forecasts for the full year. Advertising group WPP fell 3 to 99p on Sunday newspaper reports that it had shelved a planned Dollars 400m flotation. An oil find in China by the Exploration Company of Louisiana saw the company's shares rise 16 to 105p.</p>

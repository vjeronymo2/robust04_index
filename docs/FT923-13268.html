			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / EC's high interest rates come under fire FINANCE MINISTERS of all EC states, including Germany, yesterday deplored Europe's high interest rates, but conceded the level of rates was effectively in the hands of the Bundesbank. This hand-wringing by EC politicians was tempered by a widespread feeling among them that the German central bank was unlikely to raise its interest rates at its meeting on Thursday. 'My deep conviction is that the Bundesbank is not outside reality, and that the reality is that interest rates are too high,' Mr Michel Sapin, France's finance minister, said yesterday. This sentiment was echoed by Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor of the exchequer. After chairing his first EC finance ministers' meeting, he said: 'I hope there will not be an increase in German rates later this week. We recognise that unification has posed certain problems in Germany. There has to be the right balance between fiscal and monetary measures there . . . but in the end, it is for the Germans to decide.' Mr Horst Kohler, Bonn's state secretary for finance, repeated Germany's litany of budgetary problems related to unification. 'No one put us (Germans) in the dock on interest rates,' he said after the meeting. There was, he said, 'a perspective' of rates coming down in Germany and elsewhere in Europe, but perhaps too slowly to spur a job-creating economic recovery. The UK chancellor underlined the long-haul approach to lowering interest rates. He summed up the mood at the meeting by saying 'the right conditions for lowering interest rates . . . will be achieved by reducing budget deficits and inflation'. The new Italian government was praised for the measures it has taken to contain its 1992 budget deficit. Seeking to scotch rumours that a German rate rise might be accompanied by a realignment of currencies within the European Monetary System, Mr Piero Barucci, Italy's new finance minister, said there was no likelihood of devaluing the lira. Such a step 'would go counter to all the measures taken (by Italy) in the last few days', he said. The Dutch government, whose 'convergence' plan was discussed by ministers, was told that 'fiscal consolidation is the key requirement' for bringing its debt and public spending down to the levels laid in the Maastricht treaty for monetary union.</p>

			<p><P> December 27, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ NOTES: COLLEAGUES LAUD DEEJAY JIM GOSA, DEAD AT 58; FATHER TOM VAUGHN  SCHEDULED AT MONTELEONE'S  </P> <P> The Los Angeles jazz community lost a very good friend when Jim Gosa -- a  veteran broadcaster who worked at such stations as KFOX, KBIG and KKGO during  his four-decade career -- died Dec. 18 of melanoma at age 58.  </P> <P> Though a sometime film, television and stage actor who appeared in such films  as "High Plains Drifter" with Clint Eastwood and episodes of "Hawaii Five-O,"  the deep-voiced Gosa was best known as a jazz disc jockey for KKGO-FM, where he  worked for 21 years. His completely personal way of integrating contemporary  and mainstream jazz, both instrumental and vocal, into unified, flowing sets  gained legions of fans. These fans ardently followed his programs until the end  of August, when his illness forced him to leave the air permanently.  </P> <P> An intelligent man with a blindingly fast wit, Gosa was a tireless worker. For  many years he not only handled his own three- to four-hour, six-day-a-week air  shift at KKGO (formerly KBCA-FM), he also was in charge of the station's  commercial production schedule and produced many of the commercials himself. As  if that weren't enough, Gosa began studying law at night in 1982, eventually  passing the California State Bar last June.  </P> <P> Here are remembrances of Jim Gosa by four friends and associates who knew him  well:  </P> <P> "He was the absolute best at his business, a first class professional guy,"  said Chuck Niles, the renowned disc jockey who worked alongside Gosa at  KBCA/KKGO. "Everything he did was perfect. I can't ever remember him goofing.  And as an interviewer, he did that as well as anyone."  </P> <P> "I loved him so very much because he had such great taste in music," said  singer Carmen McRae. "He was very good to me, for which I'm completely  grateful. Every time I saw him, he made me feel good, like when he'd come into  the club and talk for a second. He was such a decent human being, a sweet  person and I'm going to miss him like hell."  </P> <P> "Hey, he was the samurai of the jocks. If he had a sword in his hand, he'd make  it swing," said actor Pat Morita, who, as a stand-up comedian, worked the jazz  circuit in the '50s and '60s. "I was an enormous admirer of his work and his  sound and his presence, and I was very fortunate to have been able to count Jim  in my personal little circle of friends. He was a one of a kind."  </P> <P> "To all of us, Jim has given more than he has taken. Let his memory be our  lesson," said Dennis Smith, who worked with Gosa at KBIG in the mid-'60s and at  KBCA/KKGO from 1970-78.  </P> <P> There are unfinalized plans for a memorial concert. Scholarships in Gosa's name  are being established at the Berklee College of Music and through the  International Assn. of Jazz Educators. Donations may be sent to Jim Gosa  Memorial Fund, in care of KKGO-FM, P.O. Box 250028, Los Angeles 90025.  </P> <P> Palm Springs Jazz, a three-day extravaganza, is scheduled at the Wyndham Palm  Springs resort Friday through Sunday. Among the artists on tap: singers Pia  Beck, Yve Evans and Cheryl Stephens; Conrad Janis and the Beverly Hills  Unlisted Jazz Band; Finland's Oiling Boiling Blues Band, and the Nightblooming  Jazzmen. Music starts at 2:30 p.m. Friday. Information (800) 346-7308.  </P> <P> Father Tom Vaughn, former Episcopal clergyman at St. Martin-in-the-Fields in  the San Fernando Valley, is in the midst of his first Los Angeles club  engagement in more than a year, playing Wednesdays through Jan. 10 at  Monteleone's in Encino.  </P> <P> "I decided to get out of my self-imposed shell and get back to work," said  Vaughn, who has recorded LPs for the RCA and Concord Jazz labels. "I really  like Monteleone's. It's small with a good piano. I've kind of been working on  the classics lately, like Bach's 'French Suites' and a lot of Chopin, kind of  been in the (wood)shed, so my chops are up." Vaughn, who will work with bassist  Ernie McDaniel and drummer Jack Sperling, said his repertoire will consist  mostly of standards.  </P></p>

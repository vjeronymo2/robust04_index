			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / Salinas rejects notion of one complex plot President Carlos Salinas of Mexico delivered his final state-of-the union address yesterday, offering a robust defence of his six years in office one month before he hands over to his successor, Mr Ernesto Zedillo. Mr Salinas sought to answer critics that his government had put economic reform before political change, arguing that 'democracy cannot flourish. . . when financial disorder, deficits and inflation are exacerbated.' He asserted that 'experience shows that abrupt political changes promoted from above without the consensus of parties and the support of society merely lead to a break with the old without consolidating the new.' Nevertheless, Mr Salinas said significant democratic progress had been made during his administration, and 'pluralism is now the norm in our public affairs.' The high turnout and generally trouble-free August presidential elections 'mark our passage towards a better democracy.' The outgoing president sought to explain the shocks Mexico has suffered this year - namely the peasant revolt in the southern state of Chiapas, the assassinations of presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio, and Mr Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu, secretary-general of the ruling party - as a reaction against his administration's economic and social reforms. 'I do not resort to the facile solution of an overriding plot as a general explanation for these acts of violence. . . These grave events reflect the action of isolated individuals or groups, but they may also be spurred by a feeling of rejection for changes that have been made.' The president announced that foreign currency reserves were Dollars 17.24bn at the end of October, a fraction more than the level two weeks ago. He said the economy would grow by almost 3 per cent this year, implying growth of about 4 per cent in the second half of the year. He said that for the third year in a row there would be no fiscal deficit. Mr Salinas accepted some responsibility for the uprising in Chiapas, referring to 'excessive caution' in not taking preventative security measures and failings of local government. He reiterated his call for a peaceful solution. In a tacit admission of the problems his administration had not tackled, Mr Salinas said Mexico still faced 'a major challenge of justice. Our economy is healthier, but must still provide many new jobs. . . our freedoms are greater. . . but many constraints and inequities remain which must be corrected before we can become the democratic, modern nation we aspire to be.'</p>

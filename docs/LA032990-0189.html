			<p><P> March 29, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE;  </P> <P> COUNCIL TO EVALUATE CHILD-CARE PROPOSAL  </P> <P> Redevelopment funds -- commonly used to help build shopping centers and  subsidize low- and moderate-income housing -- might be spent to help launch an  ambitious new child-care program in Garden Grove.  </P> <P> This week, the City Council, acting as the Agency for Community Development,  voted unanimously to study a proposal by the Girls Club of Garden Grove for an  expanded Kids Club program.  </P> <P> The program eventually could put 50 or more inexpensive day-care centers on  school sites throughout the city to provide supervision and recreation after  school hours.  </P> <P> Pat Halberstadt, Girls Club executive director, told the council that the  $20,000 requested by her group would be "seed money" to organize a citywide  program, based on a model facility soon to open at Stanford Elementary School,  12721 Magnolia Ave.  </P> <P> At Stanford, the Garden Grove Unified School District has agreed to lease  property for $1 a year to accommodate two modular buildings for the program.  Most of the $327,000 for the Stanford facility came from state grants, with  $21,000 donated by the Garden Grove Strawberry Festival Assn.  </P> <P> "We could put those on every school campus in Garden Grove," said Halberstadt.  Each Kids Club facility would provide space for 50 to 75 boys and girls who are  5 to 12 years old, she said. The redevelopment agency money would go to pay  staff to develop grant proposals and other administrative tasks associated with  expanding the program, she added. JAMES TORTOLANO  </P></p>

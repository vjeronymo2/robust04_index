			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Philippines lifts ban on communists THE Philippines yesterday legalised the Communist party, outlawed for 35 years, and freed 48 leftist rebels in an effort to end the insurgency, Reuter reports from Manila. President Fidel Ramos signed a law repealing the 1957 anti-subversion act which declared the party an illegal organisation and banned membership in it. The lifting of the ban has been described by officials as a big step towards ending the 23-year insurgency. Ferdinand Marcos, the late president, had used the law to put tens of thousands of dissidents in jail during his 20-year rule when the guerrillas grew from a ragtag band to an army of over 25,000 fighters.</p>

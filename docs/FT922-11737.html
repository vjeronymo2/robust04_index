			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / Gonzalez gives ground under party fire: The Socialists' internal struggles over Spain's new unemployment law PRIME MINISTER Felipe Gonzalez of Spain may have found an opposition party worthy of his talents as a pacifier - his own Socialist Workers Party (PSOE). A clear illustration of this has been splashed all over the front page of Spain's biggest newspaper, El Pais, for the past two days. On Wednesday, the main front page headline read: 'PSOE to alter unemployment decree in parliament.' This was Mr Gonzalez on the ropes as the party decided to modify cuts in unemployment benefit decreed by the government two weeks ago. Yesterday it read: 'PSOE backs government over benefit cuts in face of union intransigence.' In other words, prime minister bounces back, party 'rallies', and the unions become the bad guys. There is no point trying to make much sense of this. It is merely the left-wing PSOE disagreeing with its right-wing government yet again, and Mr Gonzalez, leader of both, working hard to hide the cracks. The benefit cuts have poisoned the political atmosphere. Mr Carlos Solchaga, the finance minister, has made them central to his convergence plan, which is designed to show how Spain plans to meet the economic criteria established in Maastricht last December for economic and monetary union in 1997. The cuts trim benefits to unemployed people and double the time in work  - to one year - required to qualify for them. The government reckons they will save about Dollars 4bn this year and, with luck, 'encourage' people to look harder for jobs. The unions have called the measures the worst attack on workers ever, and the General Workers Union is threatening a general strike in the autumn. For the left-wingers who run the PSOE, cutting benefits to the jobless while restrictive monetary policies slow investment is the moral equivalent of clubbing baby seals. It was inevitable that resentment and fear would break out, despite Mr Gonzalez's best efforts. However, as the prime minister is still the only man who can win elections for it, the party is directing its ire at Mr Solchaga, whose conservative policies have made him the bete noire of Spanish politics. He had done his work with precision. The convergence plan was published on April 2, debated in parliament on April 7, and the benefit cuts gazetted as a decree law the following day. Because party pressure had forced him into an expansive 1992 budget last year, the cuts were that urgent. A secret meeting - details of which were leaked - was then held outside Madrid by some leading Socialist party figures to try to dampen union discontent. The unions, though, continued to growl, particularly as the government is putting the finishing touches to its first law to control strikes. The party was under great pressure. A general strike in the summer could disrupt both the world's fair in Seville and the Olympic Games in Barcelona. And with no early global economic recovery in sight, fighting an election by October next year (presumably after a tough 1993 budget, if Mr Solchaga is serious about convergence) would be very difficult. On Tuesday, then, the party executive, with Mr Gonzalez in attendance, decided to tamper with the decree in parliament next week and not to merely rubber stamp it. They will loosen some benefit conditions affecting people working on temporary contracts in seasonal sectors such as tourism. While their boss kept strangely silent, Solchaga aides rushed to insist that the intent of the decree will not be affected and Gonzalez loyalists in the party seized on this to infer that nothing at all was happening. However, the party has wrung an important concession from its leader: it will now be allowed to be seen as sufficiently concerned about Mr Solchaga's 'Draconian' measures to do something about them. Mr Solchaga cannot be seen to be getting a free ride and the symbolism of any change is of great importance. The finance minister could resign but won't. Resignation on points of principle is not a tradition in Spanish politics.</p>

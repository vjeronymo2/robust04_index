			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / UN call for end to Bosnia fighting THE Security Council last night demanded an immediate halt to fighting in Bosnia-Hercegovina, the withdrawal of Serb-led Yugoslav federal troops and Croatian army units, and the disbanding of all irregular forces, Reuter reports from the United Nations. In a unanimous resolution, the council also demanded full co-operation with a 14,000-strong UN Protection Force which is taking control of three heavily Serb-populated areas of neighbouring Croatia to replace the Yugoslav army and oversee the disarming of all irregulars. The resolution calls on UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali to study ways of protecting humanitarian supplies, which have been looted by irregular forces, and of ensuring safe access to the airport at Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, through which relief flights pass. Ceasefires have been broken almost daily in Bosnia-Hercegovina, where more than 1,300 people have died since its Moslem and Croat communities declared independence in March against Serb opposition.</p>

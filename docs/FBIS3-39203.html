In Mogadishu harbor, the  Bundeswehr soldiers boarded the German frigate Cologne, heading  for Mombasa in the neighboring country of Kenya. From there,  the German UN soldiers are to start their flight home on 15  February. The Cologne arrived in Mogadishu under the strictest  security provisions. The military leadership said that the  reason for this was that terrorist attacks could not be ruled  out.</p>

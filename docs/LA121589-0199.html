			<p><P> December 15, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> AMERICAN TO FEATURE CNN NEWS -- MINUS AIR CRASHES  </P> <P> American Airline flights will feature taped CNN newscasts without pictures of  plane crashes after CBS balked at the airline's request that it cut such  stories from its in-flight programs.  </P> <P> American did not renew its six-year contract with the "CBS Morning News," and  the last program will be shown on the airline before Feb. 28, said David  Berman, a vice president at CBS Broadcast International.  </P> <P> Under American's guidelines, he said, CBS has pulled entire news programs with  reports of airline crashes or "virtually anything detrimental to the airlines."  </P> <P> But CBS refused American's request to delete adverse airline news "and deliver  the remainder of the show," he said.  </P> <P> American's rationale may be to avoid alarming passengers, but "it's like  passing out newspapers with holes cut in them," Berman said Thursday.  </P> <P> American's decision to drop CBS was financial and wasn't based on an editorial  dispute, said Mary O'Neill, a spokeswoman for the airline. "We didn't feel we  were earning enough profit from our agreement with CBS," she said.  </P> <P> She said the new CNN arrangement, in which video portraying airline crashes  will be deleted, was worked out after American's surveys showed that its  passengers complained that pictures of airline crash scenes disturbed them.  </P> <P> American's new in-flight agreement for Cable News Network newscasts is with  Turner Home Entertainment, a division of Ted Turner's Atlanta-based cable  empire that merchandises CNN productions.  </P> <P> None of the 10 other airlines using CNN has asked for edited versions of the  news, which is recorded from live feeds, a CNN spokesman said.  </P> <P> CNN is the only network with the capability to send live news feeds around the  world to be taped for international flights.  </P></p>

Blas Ople, chairman of the Senate foreign  relations committee, urged the Association of Southeast Asian  Nations (ASEAN) yesterday to anticipate potential vacuums in the  region and forge a new solidarity in defense cooperation.    Ople discussed the major strategic challenges in both  foreign  policy and security fields that ASEAN has to face at the  threshold of a new century when he keynoted a two-day symposium  of the region's leading centers of strategic and international  studies, the ASEAN Institute of Strategic and International  Studies (ISIS) at the Shangri-La EDSA Hotel in Mandaluyong.    Dean Carolina Hernandez, director of the Center of Strategic  and International Studies (CSIS), led the meeting, which brought  together an intellectual powerhouse from ASEAN countries,  including Lau Teik Soon, director of the Singapore Institute for  International Affairs; Yusuf Wanandi and Dr. Hadi Soesastro of  the CSIS in Jakarta; Dr. Kusuma Snitwongse, of the Thailand  Institute of Security and International Studies; and, Dato Dr.  Noordin Sopiee, of the ISIS in Kuala Lumpur.    At the close of the meeting, the chairmanship of the  ASEAN-ISIS passed on from the Philippines' Hernandez to Dr. Lau  of Singapore.    Ople said that while ASEAN welcomes the appearance of a new  tranquility brought about by the end of the Cold War in Asia and  the Pacific, there is no room for complacency because dangerous  new vacuums can immediately arise without prior notice and  confront the ASEAN with major threats to its security.    "Our six nations ought to be able to envision new conceptual  frameworks and a common strategic vision for our collective  security," Ople said. "The formation of the ASEAN Regional  Forum is an important first step taken by the leaders of ASEAN  in that direction."    Ople said Japan and China, although they have opened their  own bilateral security dialogues, will contest any vacuum that  arises in the region or exploit any change or shift in the  regional and global balance of power.    He said that in spite of the assurances by the United States  that its commitment to the security of Asia and the Pacific  remained undiminished, "there is a sense in which the defense  retrenchments of the United States, involving a reduction of its  military spending from six percent down to three and a half  percent of gross national product in the next five years, can no  longer be reversed."    He said while the Pentagon has set a military bottom-line of  fighting two wars in separate continents at the same time, the  American people and their leaders now accept the limitations of  "an imperial overstretch" which saps the resources required for  domestic economic and social rebuilding.    He said that in spite of the tension in the Korean  peninsula,  the unsettled conditions in Cambodia, and the potential border  troubles in the South China Sea, the security environment for  Southeast Asia has never been better, widening "our respective  windows of opportunity to engage in sustained economic  development unhampered by external security threats."    Ople said it is a tribute to ASEAN statesmanship that the  grouping has helped contain the potential disruptions of the  peace and stability in the South China Sea through creative  diplomacy.</p>

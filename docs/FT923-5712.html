			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / Survey of Malaysia (8): Economic health curbs worker militancy - Manufacturing / Victor Mallet finds concern about the shortage of much-needed skilled technicians A dozen executives from manufacturing companies in Malaysia what worries them the most, and the chances are that you will get a dozen identical answers: the labour shortage. Malaysia's economy has grown so quickly and its drive to industrialise has been so successful that employers have been forced to increase wages faster than the rate of inflation. They have even resorted to paying bonuses to workers who recruit a friend for the factory. 'Today electronics workers sometimes change jobs because the other factory has an air-conditioned canteen,' says the chief executive of one multinational company. Inflation is running at about 4.5 per cent, but most manufacturing wages have been rising by between 8 and 15 per cent a year. Unemployment has dropped to around 4.2 per cent - a level regarded by some employers as effectively zero when it comes to suitable factory workers - and the labour market in some areas is being further tightened as the numerous new foreign investments, approved in 1990 and 1991, come on stream. Some companies spend tens of thousands of ringgit (Malaysian dollars) a month bussing in workers from ever larger catchment areas. The labour shortage has been dramatised by the government's drive to register illegal foreign workers - and by a deputy minister's mistaken claim that a third of the foreigners who underwent medical checks for their work permits were infected with sexually-transmitted diseases, including the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (Aids). About 320,000 guest workers, mostly Indonesians, were registered before the deadline at the end of June, but thousands more are thought to remain in the country unrecorded. Only 0.24 per cent of those tested were found to have the virus which leads to Aids. From the point of view of employers in the electronics sector, one of the positive effects of the enforced higher wage regime has been to take the heat out of a campaign by the Malaysian Trades Union Congress to establish a national electronics union. National unions in other industries are permitted, but the government of Dr Mahathir Mohamad - with the full support of Japanese, American and other employers - has forbidden the formation of a union in the important electronics sector since 1972 and restricted workers to Japanese-style in-house employee associations. Despite the bitter taste left by a lingering dispute between trade unionists and Harris Semiconductor of the US, the economic boom has dampened worker militancy and allowed the growth of a rival trade union group - the Malaysian Labour Organisation - which is regarded with approval by the government, and which accepts in-house unions. Official figures show that electronics workers earn the highest wages in manufacturing, an average of MDollars 721 a month in 1991, compared with MDollars 526 for clothing workers. In the longer term, employers and senior government officials are concerned about the shortage of the skilled technicians who will be needed to manage Malaysia's proposed shift towards higher-technology industries. Thailand and Indonesia are facing similar challenges. 'We are aware of this problem,' says Mr Low Peng Lum, director of industrial promotion at the Malaysian Industrial Development Authority, 'and that is why the government is putting a lot of emphasis now on human resource development.' Employers blame a shortage of Malay technicians on the government's policy of funding university education in Bahasa (the local language) for Bumiputras (Malays) - which they say produced too many social science and arts graduates - while many Chinese were forced to pay for their own education abroad and returned with technical qualifications and a useful knowledge of English. 'The government policy on Bumiputeras has done the opposite of what the government wanted,' says one foreign executive. Most of the other problems identified by manufacturing companies - occasional power shortages, telephone and data line problems, congested ports and roads - are the result of Malaysia's rapid economic growth and the consequent strains on communications, transport and other infrastructure. Malaysia, which hosts such giants as Matsushita and Motorola, is now one of the top three semiconductor exporters in the world, the largest air-conditioner exporter and one of the biggest manufacturers of television sets and video cassette recorders. Since 1989, the manufacturing component of gross domestic product has been rising by 14 per cent or more a year, and manufacturing's share of total GDP had doubled to more than 28 per cent last year from 14 per cent in 1970. The Malaysian electronics industry has matured quickly, moving from 'screwdriver' assembly operations to an emphasis on 'backward integration' - domestic production of components. 'Now we see more people coming in to build more components and parts,' says Mr Low. In general, the aim is to concentrate on high-technology industry and add as much value to the product in Malaysia as possible, while leaving behind labour-intensive industries such as textiles. 'Malaysia wants to get into high technology,' says Mr Roger Bertelson, managing director at Motorola Malaysia. 'They want to attract electronics downstream manufacturers that can use a high proportion of the semi-conductors made in the country.' An executive from another multinational company says: 'These are not screwdriver operations. Today all companies divert their screwdriver operations to Indonesia, and people are considering going to Vietnam or southern China.' Malaysia has been so successful in developing its economy that it faces the loss of tariff privileges on some of its exports - the US has already withdrawn preferences for Malaysian rubber threads, Mr Low says  - and so good at attracting foreign investors that it has been forced to become more choosy. Bank Negara, the central bank, expressed concern in its 1991 annual report about what it called the country's 'narrow manufacturing base'. Although new products made in Malaysia included toys, sporting goods, photographic equipment and jewellery, it noted that electronics, textiles and rubber-based products still accounted for 32 per cent of manufacturing output and nearly 70 per cent of manufactured export earnings, making the country vulnerable to the vagaries of the world economy. Malaysia is attempting to reshape its industrial base by adjusting and reducing foreign investment incentives, and encouraging more domestic investment. 'We are now becoming selective,' says Mr Low. 'Incentives will only be given to those industries which are high-tech, capital intensive. . . We are beginning to feel some problems now with the supply of labour.' Henceforth, for example, 100 per cent foreign ownership is allowed only if the project exports 80 per cent of production or meets other criteria of size or value added. The previous export level required was only 50 per cent. As a result of this and other changes, there was a surge of foreign investment in 1990 and 1991 to gain the older and more advantageous incentives. Foreign investment approvals rose from MDollars 8.7bn in 1989 to MDollars 17.6bn in 1990, and dipped slightly to MDollars 16bn last year. This year's half-year total of MDollars 9bn has been inflated by the inclusion of a few exceptionally large petrochemical projects. Critics of the Malaysian government complain that officials are slow to begin a public debate when an economic problem emerges - whether it be a labour shortage or a lack of electricity - but they acknowledge that the authorities do respond to private lobbying and do eventually take action. Few countries could have predicted or easily absorbed the economic growth that Malaysia has seen in the last few years. 'Growth in Malaysia,' says one businessman, 'has been beyond their best-case scenario.'</p>

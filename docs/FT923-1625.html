			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / Maastricht - After the French Vote: EC must regain its street credibility / A look at the implications of the French vote for Community democracy 'EITHER Europe will become more and more democratic. . . or Europe will be no more,' Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, forecast five days before Sunday's marginal victory for Maastricht in France's referendum. Appropriately enough, he was speaking in Strasbourg at the 40th anniversary ceremony of the European Parliament, the body which is supposed to act as the EC's democratic watchdog and antennae, but which has signally failed to establish its legitimacy with Europe's citizens. The parliament's failure, however, is only part of the democratic shortcomings of a Community which, while sincerely defending the values of democracy, legislates and decides in ways which are becoming more and more removed from the people, and beyond their control. Since 'Europe' came into being 40 years ago, it has been the enterprise of the elites  - 'benign despotism', Mr Delors called it in his Strasbourg speech. France's Le Nouvel Observateur last week caught how probably most people visualise EC workings, publishing a photograph of a sharp-suited man against a backdrop of the 12-starred Community flag and with a paper bag over his head. EC paper bag-wearers include not only the 'faceless bureaucrats' of Brussels, or the 'lost tribes' of Euro-MPs in Strasbourg, but national ministers and officials who come to Brussels almost weekly to reach decisions they seldom seek, or are required, to justify before anybody. The divisions across Europe exposed by the campaigns to ratify Maastricht suggest either that this game is up, or, as Mr Delors suggests, European union will never win popular legitimacy. The Commission and the 12 are seeking a remedy in 'subsidiarity'. This typically non-user-friendly concept means decisions should be brought closer to the people. The EC would act  - with the Commission proposing and the 12 deciding through the Council of Ministers, subject to some amendment by the European Parliament  - only when national action would be demonstrably less effective. But subsidiarity, while needed to delineate responsibility and avoid clashes which fuel popular suspicion of 'Brussels', is unlikely to make the EC democratic. That would at least require reforming the operations of Council, Commission and parliament, a greater role for national parliaments in holding EC lawmakers to account, more open decision-making and debate, and better explanation. The Commission is already studying how to shrink itself into a more effective, politically alert body. The parliament is working on similar lines, in an attempt to transform its cumbersome and too often frivolous procedures. Despite what one of the driving forces in the Commission describes as its 'millenarian ideology', the Brussels bureaucracy is probably savvy enough to mutate sufficiently to survive as a shaping force in the EC. The parliament is in worse shape. The 518 MEPs, and indeed member states like Germany, Denmark, the Netherlands and Belgium, were unhappy at the modest increase in power which Maastricht gives Strasbourg. It now has amendment rights it exploits insufficiently. Under the treaty it would get more equal say on EC laws with the Council, more control over the Commission, and a review of its powers in 1996. But the most lucid minds in Strasbourg recognise that the parliament has failed to connect with its dwindling electors. 'At the moment this parliament has no priorities,' says Mr David Martin, a respected Labour MEP and vice-president of the parliament. 'You have to identify where you can wield influence. 'We have to admit that we're not using properly the powers that we already have,' he says. If Maastricht gets through, he argues, MEPs should put aside ambition for more power from the 1996 review, and 'justify our new powers, demonstrate that we are an effective body, not say we are not effective because we have insufficient powers.' Denmark's rejection of Maastricht in June, he adds, 'could be just the bucket of cold water we need, rather like it has been for the Commission.' There is so far, however, little sign of the cold shower the Council needs. The Council, as well as making law behind closed doors, frequently passes the buck to the Commission for unpopular national policy, discrediting the whole EC enterprise. France recently, for instance, asked the Commission to propose an EC driving penalty points system, similar to the one which provoked French truckers to gridlock France's roads in the summer. Brussels sensibly invoked subsidiarity and refused. Maastricht compounds the democratic shortcomings of the Council by placing the new foreign and internal security policies outside the EC remit. This provides for member states to act jointly, outside the effective oversight of either national parliaments or Strasbourg. Ideas to staunch this leakage of accountability range from opening up Council lawmaking to the public, to a greater role for national assemblies. The compromise is likely to involve greater national parliamentary control over the Council. 'We must exploit the legitimacy of national parliaments through ways and means which depend on each country,' a senior Commission official says. 'The idea that the European Parliament is the only source of legitimacy in the Community is dead.' But it is far from clear whether such a national parliamentary role will do more than massage national MPs' egos. The same official, formerly a high-flier in the French administration, acknowledges that Paris and Brussels always deal direct, without even passing reference to the French National Assembly. Denmark's Folketing, which keeps the closest watch on EC law, revealingly favoured more powers for Strasbourg in the Maastricht Treaty. The UK House of Commons is, to say the least, lively on Europe, but MPs seem more concerned to score points than examine detailed measures. One of its better-known practitioners, Mr John Biffen, said after the Danish vote: 'The instinctive prejudices and wisdom of street politicians hold the key to Europe's future, not those of the good and the great.' If he is right, the EC does not have much time left to get down to street level.

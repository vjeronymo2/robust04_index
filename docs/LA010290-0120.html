			<p><P> January 2, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> MACLEOD WAITS FOR KINGS' CALL  </P> <P> Former Dallas Mavericks Coach John MacLeod said he is "just waiting" to hear  from the Sacramento Kings, who reportedly narrowed their search for a new head  coach to MacLeod and two others.  </P> <P> MacLeod spent the last hours of 1989 trying to start 1990 with a job.  </P> <P> He met Sunday with Kings officials in Sacramento to discuss the Kings' coaching  opening.  </P> <P> "I left the house at 5 a.m. and I got back home right at midnight," MacLeod  told the Dallas Times Herald on Monday. "I spent the whole day going to  Sacramento and back."  </P> <P> MacLeod was the third person to interview formally for the position. Orlando  Magic assistant Bob Weiss, a former Mavericks assistant, was interviewed on  Thursday, and Golden State Warriors assistant Mike Schuler visited on Saturday.  </P> <P> "We had about a three-hour session and dinner," MacLeod said. "They asked a lot  of questions, and I asked a lot of questions. It was a good session, but no  offer has been made and no decision has been made. That's about all I can say  right now. I'm just waiting."  </P> <P> MacLeod, whom the Mavericks fired Nov. 29, is considered the leading candidate.  He ranks eighth in career victories among NBA coaches and has close ties to  Jerry Reynolds, the Kings' director of player personnel.  </P></p>

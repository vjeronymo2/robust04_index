			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovene </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ilja Popit: "Unemployment Rate in Slovenia </F> Declines"]    [Excerpt] Ljubljana, 16 February -- In January 1994  unemployment in Slovenia decreased despite a jump in  unemployment last December. This is a good start toward  fulfilling this year's economic forecast, which set unemployment  reduction as its priority. However, it must be noted that even  in January the number of unemployed rose in 15 communities,  particularly in Gornja Radgona and Murska Sobota, while in  Maribor, which has a disproportionately high unemployment rate,  only 14 people found jobs.    At the end of January 135,323 unemployed were registered at  the Republic Employment Office; 1.3 percent, or 1,819, fewer  than at the end of 1993. To compare: in December alone the  number of unemployed increased by 1,091. However, compared to  January 1993, the number of unemployed increased 12.7 percent,  or 15,261. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Question hangs over Channel 5 frequencies Sir, There has been considerable coverage in the Financial Times in recent weeks of coming 'information superhighways' - digital multimedia communications channels on inter alia satellite, cable TV or fibre optic/telephone networks providing a wide range of (interactive) entertainment, information and transactional services to the home or workplace. In this context, we have been alarmed to read reports that the Department of Trade and Industry is considering withdrawal of the terrestrial television frequencies which have already been allocated to the future commercial television channel, Channel 5 - this is in connection with some 'grand, slow plan' to introduce digital television in the UK using these frequencies - and that the DTI may at present be negotiating with the Independent Television Commission over such a manoeuvre. If true, this would run counter to the government's belief in market forces and entrepreneurial zeal as determining factors in the take-up of new digital television. It would also be a highly damaging repudiation by the government and the ITC of specific assurances given with respect to the existing Broadcasting Act 1990. We forwarded our own proprietary proposals to bid for the Channel 5 licence on the basis of a digital transmission system delivering a unique digital multi-channel television service. During 1991-1992, the ITC finally confirmed to us in writing that a proprietary digital television bid for Channel 5 was legally permissible under the act. At the same time, we had meetings and correspondence with the DTI, the Home Office and the prime minister. All were consistent in confirming that the government could not, and would not, interfere in the ITC's conduct of its obligations under the act with respect to Channel 5. We therefore now urgently call on the ITC to acknowledge publicly the earlier private confirmation given to us, and for the DTI to confirm publicly that it will not interfere with the frequencies allocated for Channel 5. We have already spent substantial time, effort and money on our unique digital plans for Channel 5 and are once again preparing to make a bid for the Channel 5 licence based on a digital transmission system. We trust we may therefore look forward to the ITC advertising the Channel 5 licence, as it is obliged to do under the act, later this year.

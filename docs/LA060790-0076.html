			<p><P> June 7, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. EXPLORATION OF MARS AND SEARCH FOR NATIONAL PURPOSE  </P> <P> As an out-of-state attendee at the International Space Development Conference  in Anaheim, I was interested to read the four letters of outrage concerning  President Bush's Moon/Mars initiative (May 26).  </P> <P> The space program produces spinoffs useful to the solution of earthly problems  at roughly $14 for every dollar invested in it.  </P> <P> Also, an "improbable" goal -- such as President Kennedy's man on the Moon  within a decade -- pursued actively produces a desire, a "can do" attitude, on  the part of ordinary folk to start working to solve their problems instead of  drowning them in drugs and alcohol.  </P> <P> We need a great, difficult, imaginative project to pull us together, show us  how to look beyond the ends of our noses. Only a space-related initiative has  that capability.  </P> <P> THERESA HOLMES  </P> <P> Denver, Colo.  </P></p>

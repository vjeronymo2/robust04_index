			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / Dollars 1bn Morgan and Marsh fund will invest in Lloyd's JP MORGAN, the US bank, and Marsh McLennan, the world's largest insurance broker, are planning to launch a Dollars 1bn insurance fund in the next few weeks which will make significant investments in the Lloyd's of London insurance market. With SG Warburg, Morgan is one of two banks advising Lloyd's about the introduction of corporate capital. The project, known as the Trident Fund, will also make investments in the insurance industry worldwide. Lloyd's aims to complete a rulebook setting out the taxation, legal and accounting treatment for corporate Names at the end of next month. It emerged last week that it was hoping to attract as much as Pounds 500m in corporate capital for the 1994 underwriting year. Morgan and Marsh are already co-operating on the development of a Dollars 70m Bermuda-based fund that will reinsure Lloyd's syndicates managed by Merrett Holdings, the Lloyd's agency. In a separate development, insurers including Lloyd's syndicates have claimed victory in a US pollution case following an appeal court ruling in early June. The case was one of a series of lawsuits connected with dioxin pollution in the Times Beach area of eastern Missouri. International Petrochemical Corporation, a subsidiary of Charter Oil, sued its insurers between 1971 and 1983 for the cost of cleaning up a number of sites polluted in the early 1970s. The pollution arose when independent contractors used waste oil from Charter Oil as an ingredient in a dust suppressant, which was subsequently sprayed over several sites in the eastern Missouri area. The appeal court ruled this month that policies sold between 1978 and 1983 could not be claimed on. The court has still to rule on policies in force between 1972 and 1977. A Philadelphia court last month rejected an appeal by Texas Eastern Transmission Company in a case in which the cost of pollution was estimated at Dollars 750m. Mr Stephen Tomlinson QC has been appointed to a new legal advisory panel working on a potential out-of-court settlement to the litigation between Lloyd's Names and their agents. Lloyd's announced last month that Sir Michael Kerr, a former High Court judge, would chair the panel. Simmons &amp; Simmons, the solicitors, will act as a secretariat to the panel, which will advise on the strength of Names' claims. Mr Boyd has extensive experience of Lloyd's affairs. He sat on the Department of Trade and Industry inquiry into Minet Holdings in the early 1980s and has chaired a Lloyd's disciplinary committee.</p>

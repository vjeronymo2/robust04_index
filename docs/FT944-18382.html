			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Arts: Avant-garde images of devastation - At the Barbican William Packer finds War Art set in its proper international and modernist context Britain has been alone in distinguishing War Art in this century as a particular genre. This judgment has had its critical effects. The two world wars were of course the natural subject of art, for they touched the lives of artists no less than those of everyone else. But in coming round, uniquely, in the later years of the first war, to the idea that art should be officially commissioned as document and memorial, sustaining that policy through the second war and lodging most of the products within a single institution, the Imperial War Museum, we set in place a number of idees fixes, or prejudices. Throughout Europe, artists of all kinds were drawn into the first world war. Yet so far as Britain was concerned, the work that came out of it was subsequently transmuted into a kind of official art that led us to believe it peculiar to ourselves. And ironically the more avant-garde it was, the more were we inclined to take it as anything but. For here was art related directly to a general, shared and awful experience that, safely institutionalised in popular and public terms, sat quite apart from the rest of modern and therefore difficult art. Thus set out of its proper international and modernist context, such art has too long been neglected at its true critical level. The premise of the remarkable exhibition that Richard Cork has put together is the realisation that art, great art and War Art at that, was generated in every nation touched by the first world war. What it does for the British art of the war is immediately to rescue it from its unwarranted parochialism, to test and recognise it as the remarkable achievement it really is. And to look here, again, for example, at Stanley Spencer's familiar but still extraordinary and moving painting of 'Travoys' (mule-drawn stretchers) bringing wounded into a Macedonian dressing-station, or at Paul Nash's vast and desolating painting of 'The Menin Road', is suddenly to realise that nothing more serious, more radical, nothing indeed better in any sense, was being done anywhere else at that time. Picasso? Matisse? Duchamp? Not at all. But this is no mere exercise in the rehabilitation of British art. The context serves all alike, and none more so than the Germans. The only difference is that with their avant-garde credentials already well intact, such artists as Dix and Beckmann, Kathe Kollwitz, Grosz and Kirchner, can more readily be taken as the great artists they are, even though represented by comparatively incidental work. Do David Jones's illustrations to his own epic poem of the war, 'In Parenthesis', have a right to stand on equal terms with such things? Of course they do. In all such compilations, the minor or the forgotten figures, or those more familiar but cast in a fresh light, are the more immediately intriguing. The show begins with a section on the war in anticipation, with images from such as Balla and Carra of Futurist excitement at the prospect of a great mechanical cleansing and renewal, made the more dire in knowledge of the reality to come. The corrective comes in terms of prescient foreboding and anxiety, with Ludwig Meidner's apocalyptic expressionist visions of ruin and devastation, and de Chirico, of all people, giving an extra twist to the idea of what War Art might be with a haunted image of a sailors' barracks. So the show proceeds through its several sections, from the outbreak of war and its accompanying patriotic enthusiasms, through deadlock and disillusionment to the dreadful end, and to aftermath and remembrance. And we follow the artists in this from their initial fervour and commitment to resignation, anger and despair. Through it all, the polemical and the documentary walk hand in hand, with the polemical turning to bitter satire and irony as time goes on. And as always with such things, while the polemical might carry the greater immediate emotional force, it is the cooler observation, that might inform or complement it, that hangs on in the mind. The exhibition's epigraph is taken from a letter which Paul Nash wrote from Passchendaele in 1917: 'it is unspeakable, godless, hopeless. I am no longer an artist . . . (but) a messenger . . . to those who want the war to go on for ever. Feeble, inarticulate, will be my message, but it will have a bitter truth, and may it burn their lousy souls.' Yet his own 'Menin Road' or 'Mule Track' remain the more resonant as images than his overtly ironical 'We are making a better world', for all that the imagery of devastation is much the same. For they leave us room to come to our own conclusions. Henry Lamb's large canvas, 'Advanced Dressing Station on the Struma', his manifest masterpiece, with its resting stretcher-bearers smoking and chatting beneath the trees, says it all.

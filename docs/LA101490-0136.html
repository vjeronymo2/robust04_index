			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRAZIL'S JUSTICE MINISTER QUITS; AFFAIR WITH OFFICIAL REPORTED  </P> <P> Brazilian Justice Minister Bernardo Cabral resigned Saturday after news reports  that he was having an adulterous affair with a fellow Cabinet member.  </P> <P> Cabral, 58, in a televised news conference, cited strong personal reasons for  his resignation without giving details.  </P> <P> Brazilian newspapers recently reported that Cabral, who is married, has been  having an affair with Economy Minister Zelia Cardoso de Melo, who is single.  The two ministers neither confirmed nor denied the reports.  </P> <P> President Fernando Collor de Mello accepted Cabral's resignation and appointed  Sen. Jarbas Passarinho, a leader of the right-wing Democratic Social Party, as  justice minister. He will take office Monday.  </P> <P> Cabral's resignation follows an article published in the influential Jornal do  Brasil newspaper last Sunday that said a crisis was imminent because of the  alleged affair.  </P> <P> The newspaper said the reported affair would result in the resignation of at  least one of the two ministers.  </P> <P> Reports of the affair erupted after a 37th birthday party for Cardoso was given  Sept. 19 in Brasilia. The behavior of the two ministers led journalists at the  party to report that Cabral was Cardoso's mystery lover.  </P> <P> The economy minister told reporters three months ago that she was in love, but  she would not say with whom.  </P> <P> The press had reported that Collor was unhappy with Cabral's performance as  justice minister. However, when reports of the affair broke, Collor was  concerned that a dismissal would be interpreted as being provoked by personal  rather than professional reasons, press reports said.  </P> <P> The Jornal do Brasil last Sunday said Collor had asked a polling agency to  survey Brazilians about the alleged affair. A majority surveyed were not aware  of the affair but, of those who were, most said they did not condemn the  ministers.  </P> <P> Cabral will return to Congress to complete his term as a representative in the  Chamber of Deputies.  </P> <P> He is the second minister to resign since Collor took office in March.  Agriculture Minister Joaquim Roriz resigned shortly after his appointment to  stand for state office in elections held last week.  </P></p>

			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / Treasury veto axes 'charterline' The government has scrapped plans for a national telephone helpline on the public services after the Treasury refused cash for advertising. The 'charterline' was meant to give callers information about the Citizen's Charter and tell them who to contact in order to find out more about particular services. It also offered advice on how to complain about a wide range of local and national services including government departments, health service organisations, local authorities and utilities. The service is to be abandoned, however, after incurring costs of more than Pounds 70 a call during a 10-month pilot study in three Midlands counties. Demand in the pilot area averaged 25 calls a day compared with forecasts of 30,000 a month. Mr William Waldegrave, public service minister, has rejected a recommendation from consultants who reported on the pilot to extend the service nationally. There would be minimal additional set-up costs, since 'charterline' could already handle the calls expected from the whole country at the current low level of usage. A poll carried out for the Cabinet Office last year found that 92 per cent of those asked wanted a telephone helpline to be introduced. But an evaluation of the pilot by consultants from Price Waterhouse, the accountants, found that awareness of the 'charterline' was low. The service was publicised only through posters, leaflets and local radio. Plans to use television advertising were shelved. In a change of tack, the Cabinet Office is asking publishers of directories distributed to homes in the UK to include information about the Citizen's Charter and contact details for individual services. Thomson Directories, which distributes 135 directories containing telephone numbers and other local information, will include details of government agency helplines for organisations such as the Benefits Agency and the health service. Talks are under way with BT about including similar information in its telephone directories. Details of public services and local helplines would also be included in the new postcodes directories planned by Royal Mail, the letters division of the Post Office. Royal Mail intends to send 2m businesses free directories listing the address and postcode for business and residential addresses in each of 11 regions.</p>

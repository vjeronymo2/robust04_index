			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / A sale that promises to pay on delivery: The options being considered by the government for privatisation of the Post Office A 'For Sale' notice has been hung outside Britain's Post Office. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, wants to free the corporation from what he calls the 'shackles' of public ownership. So far, the government has not yet committed itself to privatisation. But for the first time is it willing to consider selling off Europe's most profitable nationalised postal service. The Post Office's record pre-tax profits of Pounds 247m for the year to March 29 included the loss-making Parcelforce, which is now to be sold as a separate unit. By deciding to shed Parcelforce the government has made the Post Office a more attractive proposition for investors. What is potentially on offer is Post Office Counters (shops selling stamps and other postal products), which made a profit of Pounds 26m in the year to March, and Royal Mail, which handles 61m letters a day and increased pre-tax profits by almost 120 per cent, from Pounds 121m to Pounds 266m, during the same period. It is, therefore, not surprising that when Mr Heseltine recently announced a government review of the Post Office's structure and organisation - to run until the end of the year - private postal operators warmly applauded his decision, as a precursor to possible privatisation. The operators are now expected to submit proposals on how the Post Office could best be transferred from public to private ownership. The government has said it is prepared to look at everything, including breaking the Post Office up or selling it off as a whole to a single buyer. However, the path it takes is likely to be dictated by the proposals submitted by the private sector. So far three options put forward by private operators and one from the corporation's own managers are under consideration: The splitting-up of mail collection and delivery. Securicor Omega, the biggest independent parcels business in the UK, has informed the government of its interest in collecting letters from post boxes and transporting them to Royal Mail offices for final delivery. Mr Pat Howes, chief executive, says: 'We have the infrastructure to provide a significant service for the Royal Mail.' Other companies interested in sorting and transporting letters include Bridoc, the only company licensed to carry letters below the cost of the Pounds 1 Post Office monopoly on condition that it only handles business mail. Companies could be encouraged to bid for part or all of the Post Office. TNT, the Australian-owned courier and parcels group, has long been interested in delivering letters in the UK if the government gave it the exclusive rights to compete with the Post Office. The idea was rejected by Mr Nicholas Ridley when he was trade and industry secretary in 1988. But there are indications that TNT has changed its position slightly and may now be more optimistic about its chances: it may bid for, or take part in, a consortium wishing to buy all or part of a profitable letters monopoly. Mr Alan Jones, UK managing director of TNT, says: ''We are keeping all our options open.' A management buy-out. Sir Bryan Nicholson, chairman of the Post Office, is keen to win more commercial freedom. Free from government control, he would look at introducing a range of different services. He has already investigated the possibility of offering a premium letter service, guaranteeing next-day delivery at a cost of about 35p. Sir Bryan will only say that any changes in the Post Office's structure and future must take the views of its staff on board. One Post Office executive says the corporation's directors have already started to work on plans for a management buy-out. Private postal operators could be licensed to compete with the Post Office in different regions of the UK. Mr Michael Kane, managing director of Business Post, an express delivery service that operates throughout most of the UK, says he would like to opportunity to compete against the Post Office, which could remain a nationalised monopoly under this option. However, since the Post Office is so big, Mr Kane suggests that private operators be given the exclusive right to offer the same service at the same price in different regions across the country. The Post Office would then face competition from a range of private operators. But no one private postal service would compete against another. The most striking feature about the four options is that they all envisage a regulated market with restrictions on the right to compete with the Post Office. From the point of view of the private postal operators, competition is only good if it is limited enough to enable them to make a healthy profit. Similarly, the Post Office management hopes to buy a letters monopoly if it should acquire the service. The Post Office letters monopoly is at the heart of the debate - this is where its profits lie. TNT is unlikely to remain interested in privatisation if the Post Office loses its letters monopoly; Securicor Omega would like to do all the collecting and transporting of mail; Business Post wants the exclusive right to compete with the Post Office in a given part of the country; and the corporation's managers do not expect the threshold of their Pounds 1 letters monopoly to be reduced lower than 50p. Yet Mr Heseltine has reiterated the government's commitment to the proposals in the Citizen's Charter on the Post Office, which suggested lowering the monopoly on letters under Pounds 1 to a level closer to the price of a first-class stamp, currently 24p. This commitment poses a dilemma for the secretary. If he introduces unfettered competition, then it would be unlikely that the private sector operators would be interested in privatisation; if he keeps the monopoly more or less intact, then he would have broken a government pledge. Mr Pat Lupo, chairman and chief executive of DHL, the international courier company based in Brussels, agrees that the Post Office only looks attractive to potential bidders because it is a nationalised monopoly. Apart from its letters monopoly, Mr Lupo says the Post Office benefits from other privileges inherent in being a nationalised company. He cites the example of Customs. Packages sent by nationalised postal offices throughout Europe are not subject to the same rules as the private operators, which are required to fill in longer custom forms. 'We would welcome the opportunity to compete on an equal basis,' says Mr Lupo. Mr Heseltine is no doubt aware that he has a difficult balancing act to perform. It may be possible to sell the Post Office and introduce some competition. But if he tilts too far in favour of competition he may find himself with a very short queue of buyers.  ----------------------------------- ROYAL MAIL: PRELUDE TO PRIVATISATION  -----------------------------------          Pre-tax      Turnover          profits    (Pounds bn)         (Pounds m)  ----------------------------------- 1992      266.0        3.91 1991      121.0        3.57 1990       30.8        3.03 1989       89.3        2.60  -----------------------------------</p>

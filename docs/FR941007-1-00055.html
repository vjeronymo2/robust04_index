			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Like the December proposal, the revised proposal would allow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions, at their option, to include affiliate and third-party lending in their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lending record but would make certain changes to the December proposal in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this regard. First, the revised proposal would consider indirect lending by any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of an institution's affiliates_regardless of whether the affiliate is chartered or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> how it is funded. The revised proposal would not impose restrictions on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> corporate structures of institutions and their affiliates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second, the rules regarding the allocation of loans among affiliates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have been simplified. The revised proposal would also include several new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions designed to prevent an institution from selectively including (or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> excluding) its affiliate lending. Under the revised proposal, the agencies would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluate an institution's affiliate lending when assessing the institution's overall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lending performance, provided the institution (or its affiliate) chooses to collect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and report the data pertaining to such lending. If an institution chooses to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> report some of its affiliate loans in a service area for a particular lending  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> category, such as home mortgages, or small business loans, it would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to report all of its affiliate loans of that category for that specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service area. An agency would be able to consider the lending of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's affiliate, notwithstanding whether the institution wants the agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to consider its affiliate lending, if the agency were to determine that such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lending is integral to the institution's business. An affiliate's lending would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> integral to an institution's business if the institution's operations closely involve  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or support the marketing, management, or other operation of the affiliate's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lending. Lending would not be considered integral to an institution's business  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> merely because the institution had a financial interest in the affiliate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Third, the revised proposal would no longer allow an institution to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include third party loans with its direct and affiliate loans for purposes of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessing the geographic distribution of the institution's lending or the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distribution of its lending across borrower characteristics. Under the revised  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposal, third party loans could be attributed to an institution only if they meet  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the definition of community development loans. This change responds to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments from community and consumer groups who expressed concern that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions could use third-party lending to avoid their direct lending obligations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and, in effect, ``buy out'' of their CRA obligations. The revised proposal also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would operate to relieve third party lenders of the burden of reporting the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> geographic location of their loans that could have been placed on them by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> December proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> The Investment Test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the December proposal, retail institutions as well as wholesale or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limited purpose institutions would have been evaluated under the investment test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> based on the amount of assets they had devoted to ``qualified investments'' in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comparison to their risk-based capital. The focus of the investment test would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have been on the ultimate impact of an institution's investment rather than the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> investment per se. Therefore, qualified investments would not have been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> credited under the test unless they had a demonstrable impact, e.g., in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> providing loans or community development projects that benefit low- and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> moderate-income individuals and geographies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Qualified investments would have included lawful investments that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> benefit low- and moderate-income geographies or individuals in an institution's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service area. Examples of such investments would have included those: (1) in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> support of local affordable housing and community, economic, or small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> business development; (2) in community development financial institutions,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> community development corporations, community development projects, small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> business investment companies (including specialized small business investment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> companies), and minority- and women-owned financial institutions and other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> community development financial intermediaries; (3) in consortia or other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entities serving low- and moderate-income individuals and areas; and (4) in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> state and local government agency housing bonds or state and local government  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revenue bonds specifically aimed at helping low- and moderate-income areas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and individuals. Eligible grants and the donation or sale on favorable terms of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> branches to minority- or women-owned financial institutions also would have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> counted as qualifying investments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

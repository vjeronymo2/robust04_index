			<p><P> November 2, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CAMPAIGN TALK;  </P> <P> A WEEKLY WINDOW ON THE CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS.  </P> <P> INTELLIGENCE  </P> <P> Trains, planes and Arlomobiles: In a final, frenetic effort to attract voters,  Democratic gubernatorial candidate Dianne Feinstein will chug through the  Central Valley this weekend by train while Republican Pete Wilson counters by  air. Republican state attorney general candidate Dan Lungren also has taken to  the air, accompanied by Gov. George Deukmejian. Then there is the "Arlomobile,"  a 26-foot recreational vehicle in which Lungren's Democratic foe, Arlo Smith,  plans to tour the Southland Saturday and Sunday. Last weekend, Smith,  accompanied by state law enforcement and abortion rights leaders, visited 10  Northern and Central California communities in the van. He is hoping that the  trip was not a bad omen. The Arlomobile broke down just outside San Luis  Obispo.  </P> <P> Campaign shredder: The campaign for state insurance commissioner between  Republican Wes Bannister and Democrat John Garamendi has been uncustomarily  well-mannered. Garamendi has aimed his invective at outgoing Republican  commissioner Roxani Gillespie, claiming this week that he found Gillespie with  what amounts to a smoking pistol: a document showing her Insurance Department  used a shredder to destroy thousands of investigatory files. Gillespie  acknowledged the shredding but said it was routine to rid the department of old  cases where no major infraction was found. Garamendi, however, said the files  might point to misconduct. Gillespie has appealed a court order to process  30,000 complaints that a judge found she had ignored.  </P> <P> Take from the rich: The timber industry has made a big deal out of the fact  that wealthy investment manager Harold Arbit has contributed $5.1 million of  his own money to Proposition 130, the environmentalist measure to halt  clear-cutting of ancient redwoods. That didn't stop Harry A. Merlo, chairman  and president of Louisiana-Pacific Corp., from sending a letter to Arbit's  company, Concord Capital Management, seeking at least $10,000 to defeat the  initiative and win passage of the industry's countermeasure, Proposition 138.  Louisiana-Pacific itself is no slouch: It has given $1.6 million so far to the  timber industry campaign.  </P> <P> Star burnout: If their boycott of "Murder, She Wrote" is any indication, the  supporters of Proposition 140 better start worrying about the fate of their  ballot measure, which would limit terms of state officeholders. The  initiative's backers last week called for a nationwide boycott of the CBS drama  after the show's star, actress Angela Lansbury, appeared in a commercial  opposing the measure. The show had ranked 26th in this season's Nielsen  ratings. Last week, it improved to sixth place, seen in 5 million more homes.  </P> <P> </P> <P> COMPARING THE POLLS  </P> <P> A look at poll results -- past and present -- in the California governor's  race. Both the Los Angeles Times Poll and the California Poll have a margin of  error of approximately three percentage points.  </P> <P> Before June Primary  </P> <P> Times Poll taken from May 17-23  </P> <P> Feinstein: 36%  </P> <P> Wilson: 42%  </P> <P> </P> <P> California Poll taken from May 29-June 3  </P> <P> Feinstein: 40%  </P> <P> Wilson: 45%  </P> <P> </P> <P> August  </P> <P> Times Poll taken from Aug. 17-22  </P> <P> Feinstein: 39%  </P> <P> Wilson: 39%  </P> <P> </P> <P> California Poll taken from Aug. 17-27  </P> <P> Feinstein: 42%  </P> <P> Wilson: 45%  </P> <P> </P> <P> October  </P> <P> Times Poll taken from Oct. 13-16  </P> <P> Feinstein: 41%  </P> <P> Wilson: 42%  </P> <P> </P> <P> California Poll taken from Oct. 4-10  </P> <P> Feinstein: 42%  </P> <P> Wilson: 47%  </P> <P> </P> <P> Now  </P> <P> Times Poll taken from Oct. 27-30  </P> <P> Feinstein: 42%  </P> <P> Wilson: 43%  </P> <P> </P> <P> California Poll taken from Oct. 26-30  </P> <P> Feinstein: 39%  </P> <P> Wilson: 47%  </P> <P> Compiled by Times editorial researcher Michael Meyers  </P> <P> </P> <P> SOUNDINGS  </P> <P> From Kathleen Brown, the Democratic candidate for state treasurer, offering a  twist on the theory that candidates at the top of the ticket can help sweep in  other members of the slate by virtue of a "coattail" effect.  </P> <P>  "I'm looking for a petticoat effect."  </P> <P> From Republican Pete Wilson, when asked whether he was being sexist in  suggesting that gubernatorial rival Dianne Feinstein is influenced by Assembly  Speaker Willie Brown and other men, including her husband and contributor,  Richard Blum.  </P> <P>  "I didn't do anything about her sex. God did that."  </P> <P> EXIT LINE  </P> <P> "At a time when people around the world are opting in for democracy, the  champions of democracy are opting out."  </P> <P>  -- Secretary of State March Fong Eu, in remarking that voters are likely to  turn out for Tuesday's election in small numbers.  </P></p>

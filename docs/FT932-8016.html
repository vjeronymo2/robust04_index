			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Trinidad's fertiliser output down 4% TRINIDAD AND Tobago's nitrogenous fertiliser output slipped 4 per cent last year to 2.36m tonnes, mainly because of plant closures for maintenance, the country's central bank has reported. Exports by the Caribbean state, a major supplier to the US and western Europe, were 2.08m tonnes, marginally less than in 1991. Government officials say the country is now among the world's largest producers of nitrogenous fertilisers with installed capacity of 2.5m tonnes per year. Last month the government sold its wholly owned urea plant and its 51 per cent stake in an ammonia plant to Arcadian Partners of Tennessee, a major producer of fertilisers, for USDollars 175m.</p>

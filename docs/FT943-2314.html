			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / People: Peter Ridsdale quits QVC Peter Ridsdale, chief executive of QVC, the loss-making home shopping channel, has left the company abruptly and has been replaced by Mark Suckle who, as managing director of Perennis, his own UK-based product development consultancy, has been associated with QVC for the past six years. The 24-hours-a-day shopping channel went on air on October 1 as part of the British Sky Broadcasting's multi-channel subscription package, following the success of the concept in the US. At the recent Edinburgh International Television Festival, QVC's chairman Barry Diller said QVC in the UK was losing money 'like a sieve' - Dollars 15m a year. He said the channel was reaching only between 2m and 3m homes and the cost of satellite charges was high. He added, however, that he thought the channel would be in profit 'in a couple of years'. According to William Schereck, president of QVC International, the decision to change the chief executive was not a negative comment on Ridsdale. 'We felt we had to take an opportunity to strengthen the management,' said Schereck. Suckle, a native of Philadelphia who has lived in London since 1971 , has almost 30 years' experience in direct marketing and is a former vice president for product development for Franklin Mint Worldwide.</p>

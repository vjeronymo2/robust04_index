			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / Sale of mining assets attacked The government is attempting to sell 'worthless mining assets' to prospective buyers of British Coal, according to an industry newsletter published today, Michael Smith writes. Coal UK, a Financial Times publication, says the Department of Trade and Industry has included opencast assets in the sale which were refused planning applications and appeals some years ago. The worst affected of the five regions being put out to tender is central north, where 80 per cent of what the DTI has described as 'fully proven' opencast reserves have failed to gain approval for exploitation in the past, according to Coal UK. The south Wales region includes Colliers' Row, which Coal UK says was notorious as the only site to have been refused planning permission by an energy secretary after it had gained all other necessary permissions.</p>

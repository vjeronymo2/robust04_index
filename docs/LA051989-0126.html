			<p><P> May 19, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TEACHERS SEEK NEW TALKS IN ANAHEIM STRIKE  </P> <P> Amid reports that some of a $2.5-billion state budget surplus may go to  schools, Anaheim Union High School District teachers, who staged a 1-day strike  last week, said Thursday that they will ask administrators to return to the  bargaining table to resolve their bitter contract dispute.  </P> <P> Representatives from each of the district's 19 campuses attended a special  meeting at union headquarters Thursday and agreed to ask school administrators  to postpone taking the labor dispute to fact-finding, a process in which a  representative of the state Public Employment Relations Board examines the  school district's financial status.  </P> <P> In a surprise announcement Wednesday, Gov. George Deukmejian disclosed that the  state will probably have a $2.5-billion surplus, and educators statewide are  hoping that much of the windfall will go to schools. The surplus could, for  example, mean a settlement for teachers in the Los Angeles Unified School  District, who have been on strike since Monday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hope for Settlement  </P> <P> Leonard Lahtinen, president of the Anaheim Secondary Teachers Assn., said his  district's 900 teachers are hopeful that the surplus could lead to a settlement  of their drawn-out wage dispute. If not, he said the teachers may consider  another strike in the coming school year.  </P> <P> "We are going to be communicating with the district to go back to the  bargaining table to reach a settlement with us," he said. "If the district is  not willing to do that, we are suggesting that we stay in mediation until July  1 . . . after the state budget is adopted and see if we can get a settlement.  </P> <P> "If we fail to get a settlement (by July 1) through mediation, then we can go  through with the fact-finding," Lahtinen said. "Also, we have decided to take a  strike action early this fall if don't have a settlement (during the summer)."  </P> <P> Lahtinen said the union would be mailing letters to school trustees today,  requesting that they resume negotiations with teachers.  </P> <P> But Anaheim Union Assistant Supt. LeRoy Kellogg said Thursday that there is no  definite word yet on whether the surplus will indeed translate into more  dollars for his financially strapped school district, which serves intermediate  and secondary students in most of Anaheim, as well as La Palma and Cypress.  District administrators have said they cannot meet the teachers' demands  because more than 2 decades of declining enrollment has eroded the district's  finances.  </P> <P> "We have no idea," Kellogg said. "We're still planning to go to fact-finding at  this stage of the game."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Revised Budget Due  </P> <P> Kellogg said Deukmejian is scheduled to release a revised budget soon that will  outline what will happen to the budget windfall.  </P> <P> "But until we get hard figures, there's not much to get excited about until you  know what it is," he said. "We know it's going to help districts throughout the  state, but to what extent, we do not know."  </P> <P> Anaheim teachers have been working without a contract since last August.  </P> <P> According to the offer from the district for this year, teachers could receive  about a 1% salary increase because the raise is tied to budget surpluses. The  association has said it is willing to accept that. But for next year, teachers  are seeking a 3.2% increase, equal to the state's projected inflation rate,  plus a portion of the surplus after the district sets aside a 3% reserve.  </P></p>

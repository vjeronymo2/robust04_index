			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Private finance before London bonds Sir, As a US market leader in insuring municipal bonds, my company would endorse the comments made in your leader 'A mega-bond of London' (November 29) that the issue of bonds secured by future revenue streams could be the answer to the capital's transport infrastructure problems. However, our experience suggests that government should recognise that in most cases public finance up front would be required to attract private investors. Bond finance could come in after one to three years of operation when a track record of revenue streams and a credit-rating for the issuing body had been established. A reasonable number of 'live' projects are required to develop a senior bond market for long-term debt. Therefore the announcements in the chancellor's Budget on the development of the private finance initiative are a welcome step in the right direction, although a firm foundation for the ground-rules now needs to be established. Francisco L Borges, managing director, public finance, Financial Guaranty Insurance Company, 115 Broadway, New York, NY 10006</p>

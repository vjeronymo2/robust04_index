			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> When the key is turned 90 degrees and removed, the car's alarm is armed and the doors are ``double locked.'' The alarm monitors the doors, hood, trunk, side window glazing and ignition switch. If the key is not first turned in the driver's or passenger's door lock, the alarm will sound if someone tampers with the doors, hood, or trunk, or turns the ignition switch. When this happens, the horn will sound, and the hazard warning lamps and high beam headlights will flash. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After 30 seconds, the alarm will automatically shut off and then rearm itself within 5 seconds. The alarm system has its own separate fuse, so removal of any of the fuses in the fuse box of the engine compartment will not disarm the system. The hood has an inside lock release located underneath the dashboard, and is also tied into the alarm system. BMW stated that the electronic control unit for the system is hidden within the vehicle. Cutting, disconnecting, or manipulating system wiring will trigger the alarm. Therefore, if a thief did manage to penetrate to the battery circuit and interrupt it, the alarm systems' memory will trigger the alarm when the circuit is again completed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The steering/ignition lock is hardened against the grip of a screw, and the housing is reinforced to prevent removal of the lock. When the key is removed, the steering lock has a mechanism that causes the lock to instantly engage, preventing steering wheel movement without any additional action. BMW states that the steering lock cannot be broken by forcing the steering wheel because a clutch in the steering drive is designed to slip long before torque sufficient to break the lock can be administered. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> BMW states that the inside locking mechanism operates by means of a vertical plunger on each door, and that the plunger on the driver's door overrides the other plunger. In the event of an accident, an inertia switch will unlock all doors. The same key operates door locks and the ignition/steering lock, and can be inserted in a keyhole in either direction. To prevent locking the keys in the car upon exiting, the driver's door can only be locked with a key after it is closed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> BMW describes the key for the 7 Car line as being unique in that it has the equivalent of four rows of teeth. BMW asserts that the unique design makes the locks almost impossible to pick and the keys impossible to duplicate on the open market. Special key blanks, key cutting machines, and codes will be closely controlled and new keys will only be issued to authorized persons. Additionally, the first gate in the door lock keyway is hardened to resist the grip of a screw to prevent use of a slampuller. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> BMW states that an LED warning lamp on the center console which is visible from outside of the vehicle informs the driver of the arming status of the alarm/no-start systems. Upon return to the operator's vehicle, the warning lamp informs the operator if a theft attempt has been made, or if a door, hood or trunk is not completely closed. It also indicates if there are any problems with the system. Additionally, BMW states that the vehicle's diagnostic umbilical contains extra circuits which, when plugged into the vehicle diagnostic machine at the dealership, identifies problems with the antitheft system. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a complementary feature to the passive system, the operator may manually arm another alarm system and deactivate the vehicle's ignition/fuel systems so that a thief would not be able to start the engine and steal the vehicle. This active system is armed by the driver keying in a 4-digit code into the computer built into the dashboard. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> BMW addressed the reliability and durability of its antitheft device by providing a list of American and international standards for which the antitheft system has been tested and found in compliance. This list includes various environmental tests and a Swedish regulation that requires door and ignition locks to be able to resist commonly available tools for a minimum period of 5 minutes in attempted forced entries. BMW uses the proposed system's conformance to these standards as support for the likely effectiveness of the system in reducing and deterring theft. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> BMW noted that NHTSA's February 1986 Report to Congress indicates that the first year's theft rate for new introductions are generally lower because the demand for replacement parts is relatively small. BMW believes that this finding applies to its 7 Car line and that theft rates will generally be lower because of the limited total sales of these vehicles. Additionally, BMW believes that most of this car line will be stolen for the value of the whole car, not its parts. BMW stated that since parts marking seeks to deter thefts of automobiles for their parts, while antitheft devices deter all thefts, BMW believes that its antitheft system ``should be considerably more effective'' in reducing and deterring theft than parts marking. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> BMW compares its MY 1995 antitheft system to similar systems which have previously been granted exemptions by the agency. It compared its proposed system to systems installed in the Saab 9000, Mazda 929, Infiniti M30, and Lexus LS. BMW believes that its analysis reveals that its system is equivalent to, or has more extensive features than, all of the compared systems previously granted an exemption by the agency. The agency believes that the BMW antitheft device is comparable to the systems on the cited car lines. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The 1983/84 median theft rate was 3.2712 thefts per thousand vehicles produced. (See 50 FR 46666, November 12, 1985). Based on data from the FBI's National Crime Information Center, NHTSA's official source of theft data, BMW showed that for MYs 1989 through 1992, the theft rates of the Saab 9000, Mazda 929, Infiniti M30, and Lexus LS fell mostly below 3.2712. For 1989, the Saab 9000 had a theft rate of 2.3691 (per thousand vehicles manufactured), and the Mazda 929 had a theft rate of 3.3610. No theft data were available for the Infiniti M30 or Lexus LS for 1989. For 1990/91, the Saab 9000 had a theft rate of 0.5125, the Mazda 929 had a theft rate of 2.7178, the Infiniti M30 had a theft rate of 2.7496, and the Lexus LS had a theft rate of 1.8977. For 1992, preliminary data show that the Saab 9000 had a theft rate of 0.4695, the Mazda 929 had a theft rate of 2.6477, the Infiniti M30 had a theft rate of 2.7117, and the Lexus LS had a theft rate of 2.4390. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For these reasons, BMW believes that the antitheft system proposed for installation on its 7 Car line is likely to be as effective in reducing thefts as compliance with the parts marking requirements of part 541. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA believes that there is substantial evidence indicating that the modified antitheft system installed as standard equipment on the MY 1995 BMW 7 Car line will likely be as effective in reducing and deterring motor vehicle theft as compliance with the requirements of the theft prevention standard (49 CFR part 541). This determination is based on the information that BMW submitted with its petition and on other available information. The agency believes that the modified device will continue to provide the types of performance listed in section 543.6(a)(3): promoting activation; attracting attention to unauthorized entries; preventing defeat or circumventing of the device by unauthorized persons; preventing operation of the vehicle by unauthorized entrants; and ensuring the reliability and durability of the device. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Evered Bardon declines 55% and cuts dividend EVERED BARDON yesterday became the latest British construction group to cut its interim dividend after a sharp fall in first half pre-tax profits. The building materials group, which has seen its share price fall by two thirds since the spring, said that its main markets in the UK and US had continued to suffer due to the recession in both countries. Mr Peter Tom, chief executive, said there was no sign of any recovery in the UK. Improvements in the US, due to higher spending on infrastructure by some states, was patchy and still had to show through in higher profits. He appealed to the British government not to cut investment in roads in the autumn spending round, which he said would be disastrous for an already severely weakened UK construction industry. Pre-tax profits during the first six months of this year fell by 55 per cent from Pounds 10.3m to Pounds 4.6m. The company is cutting its interim dividend from 1.935p to 0.8p. This is uncovered by earnings, which fell from 2p to 0.5p. After all deductions the group made a loss of Pounds 800,000, compared with a retained loss of Pounds 3.2m last time. The shares which have fallen from a peak of 87p since May, were unchanged at 27p after yesterday's announcement. In the UK, operating profits fell from Pounds 11.5m to Pounds 8.3m as volumes and margins for sand and gravel came under increasing pressure. Sales of crushed rock and coated stone have increased but margins for blacktop were relatively thin. US profits fell from Pounds 7.4m to Pounds 4.7m. Mr Tom said the decline appeared worse than it was because the results included first-time figures from Massachusetts for January and February - months in which the state traditionally incurs losses. On the positive side, the group's net debt had fallen to Pounds 236m. This compared with Pounds 300m at the corresponding stage last year. Gearing, despite the debt reduction, remains at 71 per cent if Pounds 25m of convertible preference stock is included as borrowings. Mr Tom said that disposals in the US should reduce net debt to about Pounds 200m, excluding preference shares, by about the year end. COMMENT Evered is paying the price for its ambitious acquisition policy in the late-1980s which left the company saddled with large debts just as construction markets were falling in the UK and US. Peter Tom is working hard to cut costs and raise cash through disposals. He is doing all the right things but it is going to be a very long haul and the UK market could be still be moving against the company - particularly if the government trims road spending in the autumn expenditure round. The US looks a little brighter but recovery is likely to be slow with the economy still struggling to get into gear. Profits of Pounds 15m would put the group on a prospective p/e of 13, which is high enough.</p>

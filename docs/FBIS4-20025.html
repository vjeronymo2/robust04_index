			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Deric Henderson] </F>   [Text] The Irish peace initiative is in danger of going  into crisis, Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams said tonight.    The wide and deep gap between the party and the British  Government over the Downing Street declaration needed to be  bridged.    Peace did not come in one great and all encompassing  gesture,  he said. It required the building of trust, imagination,  courage, and gestures of goodwill which should not be arrogantly  dismissed or thrown back.    Mr Adams told a European election meeting of his party in  Londonderry: "Regrettably the peace process is stalled. It has  been stalled for too long. There is now a real possibility that  we may move into a crisis and the opportunity which exists will  be lost. We must all redouble our efforts to prevent this from  happening."    Since the signing of the peace declaration by the British  and  Irish Governments last December, the Prime Minister and the  Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew have refused Sinn  Fein demands for clarification.    Mr Adams said tonight that the document was so ambiguously  drafted, it was open to all sorts of differing interpretations.    Earlier this month the IRA, which has yet to make a decision  on the document, announced a three-day truce. But the effort by  Sinn Fein to utilise that suspension to break the political  stalemate had been arrogantly dismissed, according to Mr Adams.  He claimed: "It appears to indicate a British Government  stubbornly refusing to break from the failed policies of the  past. This is clearly not good enough. It we are to bring an  end to the violence which every generation has had to endure we  need clarity and a willingness to adopt pragmatic political  strategies and see developments in the long term. It has been  variously reported and speculated that Mr Major's refusal to  break the obstruction around the clarification issue is linked  to his concern about the Conservative right, and his dependency  upon the Unionists. If this is true and if he lacks the  political nerve to deal with this relatively simple matter, how  can he hope to tackle the infinitely more difficult decisions  which lie ahead in any peace process?" said Mr Adams.    "Are our hopes for peace to be blocked by the Tory right  wing  and the Unionists? Mr Major is not alone in having  difficulties. We all have them. But they have to be  overcome...."    The IRA's three-day suspension was an "exceptional  initiative  which created an unparalled opportunity." But the British had  closed the door on that initiative as well.    The Sinn Fein president added: "What is required is a new  and  imaginative approach which tilts the balance away from this  negative power of veto and towards the positive power of  democracy, agreement and consent. The British Government holds  the veto. Its removal would unlock the situation and create the  catalyst for real change."    The Governemnt's current policy he claimed, was effectively  thwarting the efforts to remove the obstacles which were  blocking progress. He added: "Consequently the peace initiative  in which all of us have invested considerable time and effort  and much hope, is in danger of going into crisis. We must all  redouble our efforts to prevent this from happening."    Mr Adams said the gap which seperated republicans from the  British was wide and deep, but was one that had to be bridged.  They needed to know and understand each others views and to be  clear on each others long term intentions.    He said: "The British Government regrettably appears  unwilling to look beyond its narrow political agenda and grasp  the opportunity for peace which still exists."    Republicans had consistently indicated over recent years,  but  particularly the last 12 months, their determination to do what  they could to achieve peace. Their bona fides in this respect  were impeccable.    Mr Adams said: "There now exists for the first time in 25  years a real opportunity to advance beyond the failures and  violence of the past. It requires imagination, hard work,  realism and a deep seated desire to make it happen."</p>

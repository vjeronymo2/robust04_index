			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report]  <H8>  SUNDAY TIMES </H8>   Stem Past Excesses -- While "few leaders come to power on  tides of warmth and goodwill such as President Nelson Mandela  enjoys," the "afterglow" is expected to last a "brief period"  when "the new president must strike the major themes of his term  of office, and win to his purpose the major constituencies of a  complex society," an editorial in the Johannesburg SUNDAY TIMES  in English on 15 May on page 22 notes. "The country at large has  been caught up in social turbulance since Sharpeville, since  before Mr Mandela went to jail. and the backwash swirls around  him: unrealistic expectations, lingering angers and spites,  destructive behaviour designed to make a country ungovernable  rather than to make it succeed, and habits of dependency,  resentment and irresponsibility." And the "greatest threat to  the future" is the "flight of capital, the wariness of investors  that arise from perceptions of crime, random violence, labor  indiscipline, rampant white-collar crime, fiscal profligacy,  ostentatious mandarism and all the other social ills the country  inherits from the NP [National Party]." "Mr Mandela's first  challenge is to set a different tone" and deal with a civil  service "adept at looting, a parasite class." "Mr Mandela is the  only leader in a generation who has had the moral stature to  call this nation back to work, to impose a stern discipline and  to command patience. He should not hesitate to impose on his  administration his own instincts for order, frugality and  propriety."  <H8>  SUNDAY NATION </H8>   Vigilance -- Following the inauguration last week, this  country is "bound together with a sense of optimism about the  future," "the unfolding process could certainly represent a  genuine change of fortune for the country -- but only if some of  the basic needs of the deprived majority see signs that their  vote is working for them to usher a new era," an editorial in  Johannesburg NEW NATION in English on May 15 on page 10 states.  Strikes in Transkei, Bophuthatswana and among Eastern and  Western Cape interpreters "mark the beginning of many tests  which our newly-found freedom will be subjected to" and "further  trouble could either be contained or be allowed to spread to  areas like Ciskei, Venda, Lebowa and even Qwaqwa." "It is true  that in our newly-attained democracy, the right to strike is  part of the workers' democratic right in order to achieve their  desired result. But this should take place in a disciplined  fashion." "Our liberation was a costly one and we need to defend  it with everything at our disposal. Should we relax, we should  know that we are sitting on a powder keg which will consume all."  <H8>  BEELD </H8>   RSA Can Be Rainbow of Hope -- "Yesterday at the Union  Buildings the world was witness to the formal birth of a new  South Africa committed to justice, peace, and dignity for all  its people," says a page 12 editorial in the Johannesburg BEELD  in Afrikaans of 11 May. "President Nelson Mandela said after his  inauguration before world leaders that we are a rainbow nation  which has made peace with itself and the world. The leaders who  cheered his statement are now morally bound to help make the new  South Africa a success in its growth and development. But their  role is limited. The lead will still have to be given by  President Mandela and deputy Presidents F. W. de Klerk and Thabo  Mbeki. However, "they cannot tackle the great task ahead alone.  There rests on the shoulders of all of us a great  responsibility. The people who set aside their grievances to  stand peacefully and patiently in line to vote will now have to  work hard to maintain peace and reconciliation, and make South  Africa a country of security and prosperity for all its people."  "If South Africa can achieve success, it will be a rainbow of  hope and promise to the rest of the world."    Constsructive U. S. Approach Welcomed -- A second editorial  on page 12 of BEELD argues: "The presence in South Africa of a  high level U. S. government delegation led by Vice President Al  Gore, First Lady Hillary Clinton, and Trade Secretary Ron Brown  is more significant that it would appear on the surface. Not  only do they represent the most senior U. S. delegation yet to  visit South Africa; their visit follows shortly after the  announcement of the `Clinton Plan' of economic and social  upliftment for South Africa involving 2.16 billion rands over  the next 3 years. It also follows on the U. S. President's  earlier initiative to encourage his private sector to invest in  the new South Africa. It is therefore clear that the Clinton  administration is busy putting words into action and reaching  out a helping hand as no recent U. S. administration has done.  This -- hopefully with the enthusiastic support of the G- 7  countries -- could provide the spark which the South African  economic engine desperately needs, and which could eventually  contribute to sustained growth. This new, constructive approach  is most welcome."    Police Now Serve Accepted Government -- A third editorial on  the same page quotes Archbishop Desmond Tutu's statement in Cape  Town on Monday that the police deserve praise for their role  that day, and his reference to them as "our police." BEELD  continues: "These words by Bishop Tutu encapsulate the positive  new dynamic which is moving into so many areas of South African  society." "That Bishop Tutu can now, together with all South  Africans, speak of `our police' is not due to changes to the  force, but is due to the birth of the new constitutional  dispensation. The police are no longer enforcing the laws of a  minority government, but of a generally accepted government of  all South Africa. There is still a long road ahead for the  development of real loyalty to institutions of authority and new  symnbols. It can be achieved. A divided nations needs to heal  the wounds of the past in order to strengthen itself. In fact,  it's not only `our police' or `our defene force' or `our flag,'  it's `our country.'"</p>

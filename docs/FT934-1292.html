			<p>931220 FT  20 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Pensions, reform only answer to problems (3) Sir, I am seriously concerned about the recent publication by the Securities and Investments Board of a KPMG survey on transfers of benefits from occupational pension schemes to personal pension contracts. The survey looked at 10 companies out of the 240 members of Lautro, the self-regulatory organisation - the Prudential was not among them. We have taken and continue to take a prudent and responsible approach to such transfers and do not accept the results of the survey apply to pension transfer policies arranged through Prudential representatives. Nevertheless we shall of course be happy to discuss any concerns our customers may have. M G Newmarch, chief executive, Prudential Corporation, 142 Holborn Bars, London EC1N 2NH</p>

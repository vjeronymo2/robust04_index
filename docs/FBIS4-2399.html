			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 8 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese Government  will suspend the approval of new futures corporations and  re-examine the qualifications of existing futures firms,  according to a senior Chinese official.    These are China's latest steps to avoid a possible  "overheating" of the futures market and to bring the fledgling  industry onto a healthy development track.    According to Zhu Li, secretary-general of China Securities  Regulatory Committee, which was entrusted by the State Council  last December to guide and monitor all futures trading in China,  the country will also tighten the crackdown on underground  futures trading.    The past two years have seen more than 500 futures  corporations spring up across the country, of which 50 are  Sino-joint ventures, and over 200 are unregistered ones.    At present there are 30 futures markets or trading centers  in  operation; trading items range from crude oil, farm produce,  non-ferrous metal to black metal, building materials and  treasury bonds.    However, many of these markets and corporations are not up  to  the required standards, Zhu said.    Moreover, some of the joint corporations are run for  speculative purposes. They have employed whatever means  possible to deceive Chinese clients, "resulting in the huge  outflow of foreign currencies and great economic losses."    Zhu said that in the absence of a legal framework and  international expertise, the futures trading at present in China  should be done under strict supervision.    "Rushed experiments could only incur economic losses and  even  social unrest," said Zhu.    He revealed that the securities regulatory committee is  working with relevant government departments in mapping out a  more detailed plan to redress the disorder in the futures market.</p>

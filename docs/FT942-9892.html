			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / Venables company wound up in court Mr Terry Venables' insolvent company Edennote was wound up in the High Court yesterday on a creditors' petition brought by his former club Tottenham Hotspur and its chairman Mr Alan Sugar. A judge rejected Edennote's argument that the wind-up move was an improper attempt to 'stifle' a pending damages claim by the company and Mr Venables, the England football coach. The claim is over Mr Venables' allegedly unlawful removal as chief executive and team manager of Spurs. Edennote argued that the wind-up should therefore be dismissed or delayed until after the outcome of the damages claim. The petition was based on an unpaid debt for at least Pounds 183,000 legal costs awarded to Spurs and Mr Sugar last year after Edennote's unsuccessful court attempt to secure Mr Venables' reinstatement at the club. The full costs bill claimed ran to Pounds 460,000, but was later officially assessed at Pounds 335,000. Both sides still dispute this figure. In the meantime, an interim award of Pounds 183,715 has been made but remains unpaid. Mr Justice Rattee said Edennote's biggest creditor was Mr Venables himself, with a claim for more than Pounds 1m. The company's only substantial assets were the possibility of a successful damages action and a claim for repayment of Pounds 100,000 tax from the Inland Revenue. In view of the scale of its debts, the company would remain insolvent whatever the result of its pending claims. Spurs alleged that Mr Venables improperly transferred his Edennote shares to another company he owned, possibly in an attempt to reorganise his affairs and avoid personal liabilities that might arise if Edennote were liquidated. The judge said the only way this allegation could be investigated was in the context of a winding-up. It would still be open to the liquidator to proceed with the wrongful dismissal claim against Spurs, taking into account the wishes of Mr Venables, who would have to fund the action personally in view of his company's insolvency. The judge ordered Edennote to pay the costs of the winding-up proceedings. He also granted Spurs and Mr Sugar permission to apply, if necessary, for the costs to be paid by Mr Venables.</p>

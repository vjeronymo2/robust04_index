			<p><P> January 27, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CHAPMAN WINS DESPITE TROUBLE WITH FOULS  </P> <P> Although their best player had fouled out, Chapman College Panthers pulled out  an unlikely 86-76 victory over Cal Poly San Luis Obispo Friday night.  </P> <P> When Roger Middleton got his fifth foul with a little more than 14 minutes  remaining, the Panthers could have been expected to run and hide.  </P> <P> Middleton had scored 24 points and his play had been a major reason that  Chapman (10-8 overall and 2-3 in the California Collegiate Athletic Assn.  conference) had built a 10-point lead after leading, 42-34, at halftime.  </P> <P> Cal Poly San Luis Obispo was having problems making shots from the inside, but  it was having no trouble getting to the free-throw line.  </P> <P> Stuart Thomas, who played at Mater Dei High School and Stanford before  transferring to San Luis Obispo, scored 11 of his game-high 27 points on free  throws. Many of his free throws came after Middleton had fouled him.  </P> <P> "I was scared when Roger fouled out," guard Von Shuler said.  </P> <P> But Shuler's play was a key for Chapman after Middleton left.  </P> <P> Shuler, who along with guard Chris Martin missed six games after being declared  academically ineligible early this month, came off the bench to score 14  points, 11 in the second half. Martin scored eight.  </P> <P> Both added needed depth to the Panthers, because when Middleton left he was  replaced by starting center Frantz Reyes, who was on the bench with four fouls.  </P> <P> Without Middleton, San Luis Obispo (13-5, 3-2) made a strong run and took the  lead, 59-58, with 8:55 to play when Tim Knowles, who played at Mission Viejo  High, finished a fast break with a layup.  </P> <P> But the Mustangs couldn't pull away and after little-used Beau Pack made a  three-point shot to put Chapman ahead, 65-63, with about five minutes left, the  Panthers never trailed.  </P></p>

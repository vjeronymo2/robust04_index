			<p><P> September 7, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ASK THE VET: EARLY TRAINING OK FOR PUPS; KEEP IT SIMPLE  </P> <P> Q: Is an 18-week-old puppy too young to start obedience training? I have a  black lab pup that seems very bright, and I would like to start her on her  training. Every class that I have contacted says to wait until she is 6 months  old. Is there something else that I can do?  </P> <P> Brenda Belshaw,  </P> <P> Irvine  </P> <P> A: You can start to train your pup at any age as long as you keep the tasks  very simple, use one-word commands and realize that a young puppy has a very  short attention span and will lose interest in any type of training after about  15 or 20 minutes. If you start off by teaching her name and basic commands,  such as come, stay, and no, you will be ahead of the game when she enters  obedience classes. Be patient, use a gentle voice and keep it simple.  </P> <P> Q: I recently took my two children, 6- and 8-year-old boys, to our doctor  because they had some bald, red spots on their skin. The doctor said it was  ringworm and, during his background check on the boys, asked if we had any  pets. We have two cats, both females, which go in and out of doors. We were  told to have our cats checked, since they were probably the source of the skin  infection of our boys. Our vet checked the cats with ultraviolet light and  found no ringworm. Where could the boys have gotten ringworm? Is there another  way to check the cats? If they do have ringworm, do we have to get rid of the  cats? The boys are being treated and are doing well. What do you suggest?  </P> <P> M.L.D., Villa Park  </P> <P> A: Ringworm is a common name for any fungal infection of the skin that causes a  circular lesion with hair loss. These infections are caused by types of fungal  organisms, more than 20 of which infect man and 10 to 12 of which infect  animals. Of all these different fungi, only about four affect both man and  animals. The most common fungus is called Microsporum canis, which affects cats  and dogs as well as man. These fungi are all soil-borne that can be highly  contagious to susceptible people, such as children. It is not uncommon for cats  or dogs to spread the fungus to children or for children to spread it to their  pets or members of the family. When examining a cat for ringworm, the coat is  checked for any loss of hair or for thin, crusty lesions that generally do not  itch. Ultraviolet light is routinely used to find the spores of the fungus. The  spores will appear lime-green on the hair shafts. However, not all of these  spores will show up. It may be wise to remove some hair from a suspected area  and place it on a dermatophyte culture to see if the fungus will grow. The hair  shafts can also be treated with an agent and checked under a microscope for  spores. If your cats do have ringworm, they can be treated by medicated baths,  topical medication, oral medication -- if the infection is widespread -- and  clipping the affected areas. If the cats are infected, it would not be  necessary to get rid of them, although it might be necessary to confine them  and restrict their contact with family members until their condition is  cleared.  </P> <P> Got a question about your pet?

			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Now it's easier to be generous - Charitable Giving / The Budget and You IT WAS A generous Budget for the generous, and giving to charity is now more tax-efficient than ever. Adjustments were made to two schemes: Gift Aid This allows tax relief for one-off big donations. The minimum amount which can be donated under the scheme and still qualify for tax relief has been lowered from Pounds 400 to Pounds 250, having dropped last year from Pounds 600 to Pounds 400. Under the scheme, a gift of at least this size is treated as net of basic rate tax. Thus, for any donation of Pounds 250, the charity will receive Pounds 333.33 once the Revenue's tax rebate is added on. Those who pay top-rate tax are entitled to claim back the difference between top and basic rate (15 per cent), which comes to Pounds 50. So, it is possible to give Pounds 333 to charity for a net outlay of Pounds 200. One item to note arising from this reform is that there is now no point in a top-rate taxpayer making a donation of Pounds 200 or more without going through the Gift Aid formalities. Give As You Earn GAYE, organised by employers, involves donations made through monthly automatic deductions from your pay cheque. These deductions are made from gross pay, rather than net, which makes the scheme very tax-efficient. The maximum amount which can be deducted per month has been increased from Pounds 50 to Pounds 75. That means that basic-rate taxpayers donating the maximum pay only Pounds 56.25, while top rate-payers part with only Pounds 45. Payroll donations can be made to more than one charity, and the Charities Aid Foundation will be contacting all GAYE donors to explain how they can take advantage of the new maximum. Unfortunately, according to the Charities Tax Reform Group, there is now more need to be generous to charity. The group said the charitable sector would be 'significantly worse off,' one reason being the cost of imposing VAT on fuel and power.</p>

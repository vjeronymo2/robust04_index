			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / World Trade News: Tokyo move on Uruguay Round A Japanese parliamentary committee yesterday approved a package of trade and farm bills linked to the Uruguay Round global trade accord. The package, which includes legislation concerning the World Trade Organisation and a new law governing distribution and retailing of rice, is likely to pass the lower house today. Although the ordinary parliamentary session ends on Sunday, the government is seeking an extension of about five days in order for the package to be approved by the upper house. Politicians representing the farm lobby had threatened to oppose the package unless substantial compensation was made to the agricultural sector. Under the Uruguay Round agreement, Japan will open its rice market, importing 4 to 8 per cent of domestic rice consumption over the next six years. Heavy lobbying by politicians, backed by the rural vote, forced the government to agree to fund a rural support package with a supplementary budget separate to the annual agricultural budget.</p>

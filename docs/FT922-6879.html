			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / Peace in Beirut hit by storm over reconstruction: The battle over a Dollars 2.65bn plan to transform a ravaged city PLANS to reconstruct the war-ravaged heart of Beirut have generated a controversy as fierce as any which marked the 1975-90 civil war. If successful, the Dollars 2.65bn plan will transform 135 hectares of desolate ruins into skyscrapers, condominiums, parking lots and shopping malls, complete with a 40-storey, twin-tower World Trade Centre, an opera house, museums, an artificial island and a palm-lined avenue wider than the Champs-Elysees. The dispute has been the subject of television documentaries and impassioned newspaper columns. It promises to generate legal battles for decades to come. Opponents have staged sit-ins and spread allegations of malpractice against proponents of the plan, many of whom have ties to the Lebanese-born Saudi billionaire Mr Rafiq Hariri. Landlords claim that expropriation of their buildings in exchange for shares in a property company constitutes theft and that archeological treasures will be buried. Conflicting views of Lebanon's past and future, of the rights of individuals and the public good, are tinged with religious and class prejudice. Opponents also object on aesthetic grounds to the architectural design, which Lady Yvonne Cochrane, the aristocratic president of the owners' and tenants' association, labels 'the dream of a retarded adolescent.' Advocates insist that failure to carry out the project would doom the city's centre to being a perpetual slum inhabited by refugees and squatters - and prevent the rehabilitation of the entire country. 'The law has been passed,' says Mr Fadel Shallak, president of the Council for Development and Reconstruction (CDR), the organisation responsible for creating the new Beirut. 'These people who are still arguing six months later are a continuation of the civil war. They lack discipline. They think they are more important than the state. In doing these designs, we have tried to express the future of a strong Lebanese state.' Opponents say the plan contravenes the Lebanese constitution, which protects private property. In exchange for their stake in the city centre, 127,000 landlords and tenants are offered 50 per cent of the shares in a real estate company to be formed pending completion of a financial assessment. The other half will be owned by investors, who will initially contribute capital equal to the assessed value of the land. The company is tax exempt for 10 years, and capital will be increased as building progresses. Over the next 25 years, the real estate company will sell off its property. The CDR argues that no other solution could resolve claims of landlords and tenants; the latter say they are being forced into a partnership with third parties they do not know and who are not legally committed to completing the project. Although he avoids publicity, Mr Hariri is the central character in the saga. The 47-year-old son of Sunni Moslem farmers from the southern Lebanese port city of Sidon emigrated to Saudi Arabia 27 years ago. In a local-boy-makes-good story that has endeared him to his supporters and aroused the scorn and suspicion of his detractors, he won the favour of Saudi Arabia's King Fahd, purchased the French construction giant Oger and proceeded to build much of modern Saudi Arabia. Mr Hariri founded the Mediterrannee banking and insurance group and owns significant shares in a half-dozen other international banks. This year he established a media holding company for his radio stations and two planned television stations. He established in 1984 a foundation which pays university fees for 12,000 Lebanese students every year. According to one of his aides, he contributes Dollars 87m to charities in Lebanon every year. For his acolytes, Mr Hariri is a disinterested philanthropist; his enemies say he is buying off public opinion - and the country. Lebanese President Elias Hrawi lives in a building that is owned and maintained by Mr Hariri. Mr Shallak, who began working for Mr Hariri in 1978, says that the CDR is an independent, government-financed organisation, in spite of the fact that Mr Hariri has made clear his intention to subscribe to the legally allowed maximum of 10 per cent in the Beirut real estate company, paid for renovation of the CDR's new headquarters and personally bankrolled two master reconstruction plans, one for Beirut, the other for all of Lebanon. The largest engineering consultant in the Middle East and the eighth biggest in the world, the Lebanese company Dar Al-Handasah was given responsibility for the Beirut plan. The Dollars 7.5m contract for the national plan was split between Dar Al-Handasah and the US company Bechtel, which refused to send any of its staff to Lebanon. Invitations to tenders for the first three years of their Dollars 4.5bn national plan will be issued this month. The Lebanese Parliament last autumn passed a law giving the CDR wide powers. 'We are free of all red tape and bureaucratic procedures,' says Mr Shallak. 'It is in our bye-laws that we should be given freedom to do our job.' He is sensitive to accusations of conflict of interest, but says 'sometimes we have to make a choice between what is good for the country and nice formal aspects.' Under the direction of the CDR, Oger Liban, Mr Hariri's company, is supervising the dynamiting of unsafe buildings in the old city centre. Before the work started, Mr Samir Rebeiz, an architect, photographed every building. Although many no longer exist, he continues to classify them according to historical period, architectural style, urban value, present condition and the feasibility of restoration. 'Only 10 per cent of the buildings were actually unsafe,' he says. 'They had to destroy them to maximize the number of offices and apartments they can build.' Mr Rebeiz particularly regrets the destruction of medieval vaulting in the Tawile and Ayass souks, a 17th-century stone structure with a crenellated roof, and an 18th-century Greek Orthodox monastery. He says that the master plan would raze vestiges of the medieval city walls and build over an area where ancient Canaanite artefacts were found before the civil war. The CDR has asked Unesco to carry out archeological studies in line with Dar Al-Handasah's master plan and invited the Lebanese Department of Antiquities to excavate parts of the city. But archeologists say they have been given permission to work only in 3m-wide segments of an unpromising area with a high water table and six metres of surface sewage. Mr Henri Edde, the Lebanese architect in charge of 200 Dar Al Handasah consultants working on the Beirut project, brushes off the criticism: 'Can you imagine that such a huge project would not have opposition? When the French built the Pompidou Centre and the Louvre Pyramid there was an outcry. Prince Charles argues with architects. We are not responsible for the destruction of these buildings. It was the fighters in the war who did it. The people who are now screaming 'Stop the bulldozers' didn't try to stop them. If they delay reconstruction or make it impossible, they will be judged by history.'</p>

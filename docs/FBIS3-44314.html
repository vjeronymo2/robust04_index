			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, December 30 (XINHUA) -- China is  "unshakeably committed" to enforce the Basic Law of the Hong  Kong Special Administrative Region and to resume its sovereignty  over Hong Kong in 1997, a XINHUA commentary stated today.    According to the commentary, a spokesman for the Hong Kong  and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council stated on December  27 that in accordance with the Sino-British Joint Declaration  and the Basic Law, the administrative power of the British  Government over Hong Kong will expire on June 30, 1997, while  Hong Kong's British political structure will end.    The three-tier political structure in Hong Kong -- the  Legislative Council, district boards and municipal councils --  will be disbanded on June 30, 1997, and will be restructured in  line with the Basic Law and the decision of the National  People's Congress, China's legislature, the commentary noted.    In the final analysis, the commentary said, the essence of  the Sino-British confrontation over the Hong Kong question is  that "China is determined to resume its sovereignty over Hong  Kong, whereas Britain does everything in its power to extend its  colonial rule over Hong Kong."    For that purpose, the British authorities attempted to  create, under the cover of "democracy," a status quo that they  thought the Chinese Government would have to accept after 1997,  so that they would be able to continue their rule over Hong  Kong, the commentary added.    Having made careful organizational arrangements for Hong  Kong's Legislative Council and other institutions, Hong Kong  Governor Chris Patten asserted more than once that he did not  believe that the Chinese Government would "overthrow" these  institutions after 1997.    The commentary said that the errors made by Patten and other  British politicians lie in that they underestimate China's  determination to resume its sovereignty over Hong Kong and  uphold the Basic Law of Hong Kong.    That China recovers its sovereignty over Hong Kong is to  realize a long-term wish of the Chinese nation and to put an end  to the most ugly phenomenon of colonial rule in the modern  history of the world, it stressed.    "Is there any country in the world that dares to accuse  China  for its just action, and dares to serve as an apologist for  colonialism?" the commentary asked.    For resuming its sovereignty over Hong Kong, it went on, the  Chinese Government has taken a rational approach, namely,  establishing a special administrative region in Hong Kong and  pursuing a policy of "one country, two systems" with regard to  Hong Kong. That policy has been provided for in the Basic Law  of Hong Kong.    The Basic Law is due to come into force on July 1, 1997.  "The Chinese Government hopes to cooperate with the British  Government in order to effect Hong Kong's smooth transition and  successful transfer of political power in 1997," the commentary  said.    "However, by no means shall we beg the British Government  for  such cooperation," it stressed.    It also warned that whatever contradicts the Basic Law will  be overthrown.    The commentary called the attention of the British  Government  and Chris Patten to the fact that it is out of the question for  them to impose the three-tier political structure on the Hong  Kong special administrative regional government.</p>

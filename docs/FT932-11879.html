			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / International Company News: US drug group buys back stock JOHNSON &amp; Johnson, the US healthcare group, yesterday unveiled a plan to buy back up to Dollars 500m of its outstanding common stock and raised its quarterly dividend by 13 per cent. Mr Ralph Larsen, chairman and chief executive, said the share repurchase programme was for general corporate purposes. 'We believe that Johnson &amp; Johnson's current stock price level reflects the uncertainty in the US marketplace for health care stocks, rather than the market's perception of our deep product pipeline and our prospects for future growth,' he added. On Wall Street, shares in the company were unchanged at Dollars 42 5/8 at mid-session. The news prompted Standard &amp; Poor's, the US ratings agency, to affirm its triple-A long-term debt ratings on the company. S&amp;P said its well-established positions in diverse health-care markets would provide the financial strength to complete the share repurchase programme without affecting credit quality. The dividend increase, to 26 cents a share from 23 cents, represents the 29th consecutive year of higher dividends on the stock. The company also posted net income yesterday of Dollars 503m, or 77 cents a share, for the first quarter of 1993 on sales of Dollars 3.56bn. A year earlier, Johnson &amp; Johnson had underlying earnings of Dollars 452m, or 68 cents, on sales of Dollars 3.36bn. Charges of Dollars 595m for changing accounting standards contributed to a 1992 first-quarter deficit of Dollars 143m, or 22 cents. Domestic pharmaceutical sales rose 11 per cent in the latest quarter, led by recently introduced products, such as its Ortho-cept oral contraceptive and Leustatin, a drug that treats hairy cell leukaemia. But more restrictive labelling reduced sales of Hismanal, a once-a-day antihistamine. Sales of Tolectin, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, also fell. The drug went off patent in 1992. US consumer sales were flat, but international consumer sales rose 8.1 per cent.</p>

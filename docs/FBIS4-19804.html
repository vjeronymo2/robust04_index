			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Ian Hamilton Fazey article: "CBI Chief Hints at `Risible' </F> Euro Laws"]    [Text] The Confederation of British Industry [CBI] plans to  develop a Europe-wide business agenda to unite EU [European  Union] business leaders in resisting intrusive social  legislation, Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the  Confederation of British Industry, said last night. Attacking  "ill-conceived," "disappointing," and "risible" policies in  Brussels and among EU member governments, Mr Davies told the  annual dinner of the Yorkshire and Humberside regional CBI that  EU legislation on social policy was being brought into disrepute.    It was time for the European business community to act in  its  common interest and force politicians to take notice. The CBI's  business agenda would be published next month.    Mr Davies said recent "disappointing developments" in Europe  include:    1. EU member governments' discussions of a white paper on  growth, competitiveness and employment by Mr Jacques Delors, the  European Commission president, were focusing on new social  policy initiatives and running counter to the document's  original themes.    2. A green paper on social policy which had focused on ways  of increasing the cost of employing labour instead of how to get  Europe's 20 million jobless back to work.    3. Failure by the EU and the Council of Ministers to prevent  a proliferation of state aid for steel, telecommunications  energy and air travel, putting British companies at a  disadvantage.    4. The failure of the EU to get to grips with its spending.  Auditors had produced "dismal catalogues of fraud and waste",  yet the commission took little interest.    All large European employers opposed the European Works  Council Directive -- discussed yesterday by the Council of  Ministers -- said Mr Davies, because it would cut across  existing satisfactory consultation arrangements, impose new  administrative burdens, push up costs and slow down  decision-making.    Britain was not obliged to follow it because of its opt-out  from the Maastricht social chapter, but 90 UK companies would be  affected in mainland Europe and the EU was funding a union  campaign to persuade companies which were not affected by the  directive to follow it voluntarily.    He dismissed the commission's claim that the directive would  increase identification of employees with their companies and  increase productivity.</p>

			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / Deutsche shrugs off recession DEUTSCHE BANK, Germany's biggest bank, expects 1993 profits at least to match last year's level, in spite of poor economic conditions and high credit risks, according to chairman Mr Hilmar Kopper. The scale of the bad debt risks showed up for the first time in half-year results published yesterday. Risk provisions, especially for domestic credits, totalled DM1.38bn compared with DM955m last year. Operating earnings, adjusted for the provisions, rose 12.6 per cent at DM2.56bn (Pounds 994m). The figures were prepared for the first time according to new European community guidelines. On a like-for-like basis with 1992 first-half results, earnings were 22 per cent higher at DM3.86bn. Mr Kopper said the bank was flexible and strong enough to achieve a satisfactory result even in today's difficult environment. Net income last year was DM1.8bn compared with DM1.4bn in 1991. After-tax earnings in the first half of this year rose 14.3 per cent to DM1bn, against DM915m. Net interest income advanced to DM5.85bn from DM5.5bn, while trading earnings rose strongly from DM600m to DM808m. Customers' deposits increased DM17bn to DM259bn, while savings deposits dropped by almost DM1bn to DM42.2bn. Group operating costs rose from DM5.2bn to DM5.7bn. Deutsche, the first of the big banks due to report in the next few weeks, suffered a 3.2 per cent fall in operating profits in the first part of 1992, blaming global economic conditions. German bankruptcies have risen rapidly among long-established industrial companies, and only yesterday the VDA car industry association warned of looming insolvencies among motor component suppliers, many of which are medium-sized privately owned concerns. So far in 1993, corporate insolvencies are up 20 per cent over the early part of 1992, when the economy was still growing relatively strongly. Yesterday's Deutsche figures confirmed the slowdown forecast by Mr Kopper in May.</p>

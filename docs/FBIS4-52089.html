			<p>BFN     [Text] Hanoi, May 5 KYODO -- Vietnam reacted angrily  Thursday [5 May] to Japanese Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano's  remarks on Japan's part in World War II, saying his comments  were contrary to historical facts.    Nagano's remarks ignored the apologies made by Japanese  leaders to Asian countries, a foreign minister spokesman said.  Disapproval will be voiced in many Asian countries  simultaneously, the spokesman said.    Some two million Vietnamese starved to death while Japanese  troops occupied Vietnam from 1940 and 1945.    Last August Vietnam welcomed then Japanese Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa's recognition of Japan's responsibility for  World War II. Hosokawa said shortly after assuming office that  Japan waged "a war of aggression" and it was "a wrong war."</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Rosemarie V. Francisco] </F>   [Text] Environment officials and ministers of the  six-member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian  Nations (ASEAN) recently approved the implementation of a  strategic plan of action on the environment (ASPEN) over a  four-year period.    The approval of the plan was a major achievement of the 6th  ministerial meeting on the environment since it harmonized  environmental quality standards in the region, said Department  of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) Undersecretary  Benjamin Bagadion, Jr. who headed the ASEAN Senior Officials on  the Environment (ASOEN), the technical group which drafted the  action plan.    Also, the ASEAN-member countries gave their go-signal to the  proposal allowing the Philippines to house the ASEAN  biodiversity center. This facilitates the release of the U.S.  $19 million funding for the center which will be provided by the  European Union, since the funding was hedged on whether the  ASEAN will approve the proposal.    The approval of the action plan took less than a year. The  plan, which has 10 strategies and 27 specific actions spelled  out the countries' commitments with regard to sustainable  development.    Mr. Bagadion said the environment officials from Indonesia,  Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Brunei  Darussalam which hosted the 6th ministerial meeting on the  environment, all lent their full support to the action plan,  thus, the speedy approval.    The ASPEN's objectives are the following:    -- respond to the specific recommendations of Agenda 21, the  action plan adapted by the United Nations Conference on  Environment and Development (UNCED), which required priority  action in the region;    -- introduce policy measures and promote institutional  development that encourage the integration of environmental  factors in all developmental processes both at the national and  regional levels;    -- establish long-term goals on environmental quality and  work towards harmonized environmental quality standards for the  ASEAN region;    -- harmonize policy directions and enhance operational and  technical cooperation on environmental matters, and undertake  joint actions to address common environmental problems; and    -- study the implications of ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) on  the environment and take steps to integrate sound trade policies  with sound environmental policies.    During the meeting, the ASOEN formed six working committees  on six environmental issues such as transboundary pollution,  nature conservation, environment conservation, marine  environment, environment management, and information and public  awareness in order to fully discuss the region's specific  concerns.    The action plan calls for the implementation of the  following  10 strategies:    -- support the development of a regional framework for  integrating environment and development concerns in the  decisionmaking processes;    -- promote government-private sector interactions that lead  towards the development of policies that mutually support the  thrust of each sector;    -- strengthen the knowledge and information data base on  environmental matters;    -- strengthen institutional and legal capacities to  implement  international agreements on the environment;    -- establish a regional framework on biological diversity  conservation and sustainable utilization of its components;    -- promote the protection and management of coastal zones  and  marine resources;    -- promote environmentally sound management of toxic  chemicals and hazardous wastes and control of transboundary  movement of hazardous waste and their dispersal;    -- develop a system for the promotion of  environmentally-sound technologies;    -- promote regional activities that strengthen the role of  major groups in sustainable development; and    -- strengthen the coordinative mechanism for the  implementation and management of regional environment programs.</p>

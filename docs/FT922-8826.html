			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / State steps in to avert crisis in financial sector: Problems arising from Sweden's lending in the 1980s SWEDEN'S centre-right government may be committed to a sweeping privatisation programme. Yet the crisis within the banking system has reached such proportions that the state has been forced to intervene directly to secure the future of Nordbanken, the country's second largest commercial bank. The magnitude of the bank's problems forced the government to step in last Friday with a pledge of SKr20bn (Pounds 1.89bn) for 'guarantees, loans, or capital infusions' to restructure the bank and help stabilise the country's banking system. Mr Bjorn Wahlstrom, Nordbanken's chairman, underlined the severity of the bank's plight when he warned that mounting credit losses would have made it impossible for the bank to achieve the 8 per cent minimum capital adequacy ratio set out by the Bank for International Settlements. Nordbanken, in which the state already has a 77.3 per cent stake, is not alone in its problems. After the deregulation of Nordic financial markets in the 1980s, and the lifting of controls on lending, the banks scambled for customers - in some cases paying little attention to their credit worthiness. The boom and subsequent collapse in Swedish property prices exacerbated the problem for the banks, which were last year hit by big credit losses. Total credit losses for Sweden's financial institutions in 1991 climbed to SKr48.1bn, nearly three times the 1990 figure. According to Mr Anders Sahlen, head of the country's independent Bank Supervision Board, further financial support will be needed to save other banks in difficulties. The new government has already been forced to help rescue Forsta Sparbanken, the Swedish savings bank, while Gota, one of the larger commercial banks, is being taken over by Trygg Hansa SPP in order to bolster confidence in the bank's financial position. In the autumn the state had to provide a guarantee for Nordbanken's SKr5.2bn new share issue. This, though, proved insufficient to meet its needs. The country's leading private commercial banks - Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken and Svenska Handelsbanken - believe they are put at a competitive disadvantage by the state's intervention. Both have been hit by credit losses but are in stronger positions than others in the sector. Swedish banking shares dropped sharply last Friday. However, as there is no bank industry rescue fund such as the one in Norway, bankers accept that the government had little alternative but to support Nordbanken. Nordbanken has suffered the heaviest credit losses. Last year it reported a loss of SKr5.8bn, the biggest in Swedish banking history, following credit losses of SKr10.5bn. At the end of last month, the bank's board recognised it had no alternative but to turn to its largest shareholder - the state. The state will acquire the outstanding 22.7 per cent, including a 12.6 per cent stake owned by Nobel Industries, the Swedish chemicals group, for SKr21 per share at a cost of SKr2bn. In addition the government will provide SKr20bn for a restructuring of the bank. 'It is shocking that the taxpayers must pay but we were obliged as a shareholder to act', admitted Mrs Anne Wibble, the finance minister. The state-controlled bank has faced strong criticism in the past. Soon after its creation, when PK Banken agreed to pay SKr5.8bn to acquire Nordbanken, a regional commercial bank, soaring credit losses led the Swedish government to dismiss the bank's chief officers and most of the board. Last year, the new management implemented rationalisation measures in an effort to stem the financial deterioration. However, as the Swedish economy continued to suffer from a recession, these measures proved insufficient and the situation shows no signs of improvement. Nordbanken forecasts credit losses of SKr4bn for the whole of 1992. Under the latest plan, the bank is to be divided into two businesses. A finance company - Securum - will be created, containing Nordbanken's outstanding non-performing loans and other assets totalling SKr60bn, as well as the administration of a large property portfolio. The other arm, which will be prepared for eventual privatisation, will consist of Nordbanken's normal commercial banking operations. Credit Suisse First Boston has been appointed to find a new owner as Mrs Wibble insists the state wants to privatise the bank as soon as possible. In the present gloomy market it seems unlikely any large foreign institution will be interested in acquiring the bank, although there was widespread speculation earlier this year that it might merge with the Gota group. But as Gota is being taken over by Trygg Hansa SPP, this solution appears less likely. The cost of pulling the whole of the Swedish financial system out of its present difficulties looks like being a high one for the long-suffering taxpayer. The cost to the state of the current rescue operation for Nordbanken is a hefty sum on top of Sweden's already bulging budget deficit of up to SKr80bn. Government officials privately admit that the state's rescue of Nordbanken could eventually precipitate a comprehensive restructuring of Sweden's banking sector. However, there still seems a long way to go before Sweden can boast a stable banking system and further upheavals cannot be ruled out.  -------------------------------------------------------------------                              1991 results                             SWEDISH BANKS  -------------------------------------------------------------------                             OPERATING    PROVISIONS      1991                              PROFIT       SKr bn      PROVISIONS                              (LOSS)                  AS PERCENT OF                              SKr bn                  TOTAL LOANS  ------------------------------------------------------------------- S-E Banken                    2.3          4.8           1.5 Gota Banken                  (2.1)         3.8           4.6 Nordbanken                   (5.8)        10.5           3.9 Svenska Handelsbanken         2.8          3.2           1.1 Forsta Sparbanken            (5.5)         5.7           na  -------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

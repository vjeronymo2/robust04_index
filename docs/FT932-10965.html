			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Asil Nadir Flees to Cyprus: Clever as a fox, but will he become a bird in a gilded cage? 'NO WORDS can express the happiness I feel coming back to my people,' Mr Asil Nadir cheerfully told Turkish journalists yesterday as he emerged from his hideaway in northern Cyprus. But although his flight has now put him outside the reach of British law, it is a homecoming that could turn bittersweet. His first day on his native island for two years was spent in the bosom of his family. His mother, Mrs Safiye Nadir, and sister, Mrs Bilge Nevzat, arrived early in the afternoon at Mr Nadir's luxuriously furnished home in the mountains beyond the coastal resort of Kyrenia. Well-wishers arrived in a constant stream. They were vetted by a chauffeur before being led inside through the heavy wooden front doors. Journalists from two Turkish mainland dailies and Turkey's broadcasting corporation were ushered into the house for a brief meeting but afterwards said only that they had promised Mr Nadir their conversation was 'off the record'. Later, Mrs Nevzat peered, broadly smiling, around the half-open door and said her brother would be willing to speak to the press only 'in a few day's time'. Mr Nadir's return was the talk of north Cyprus and the focus of enormous interest among his neighbours. One shop-owner said one of Mr Nadir's workers had been airing the empty house for a few days and had called that morning to fetch shopping. 'It looks as if they were going to have a celebration', he commented. Cans of soft drinks, red and white wine, vodka and whisky were among the goodies stowed in the boot of a black Mercedes parked outside the house. Villagers said they were shocked, surprised and happy to see Mr Nadir. 'Asil is a fox . . . he has used his brain', said one elderly man. Unlike some other fugitives from criminal charges in Britain, Mr Nadir enjoys the advantage is that he is now on home soil - reportedly with three houses on the island and the apparent tacit support of the local government. If he intends to stay there permanently, as his Turkish Cypriot neighbours believed yesterday, Mr Nadir's life seems likely to be luxurious, albeit somewhat downbeat. It will be nevertheless something of a comedown from the opulence he had been used to in London. Mr Nadir's home was in Belgravia, owned by the Grosvenor Estate, which had been seeking to evict him for some months. Mr Neil Cooper, his trustee in bankruptcy, said yesterday: 'Mr Nadir lived in a certain opulent lifestyle as befits the chairman of a major public company.' Even after his bankruptcy, Mr Cooper said Mr Nadir had often been able to find money, explaining that his expenses were being paid by 'various friends and associates prepared to support him'. Mr Cooper's efforts to trace personal assets - with which Mr Nadir did not always fully co-operate - give some insight into this lifestyle. He has tracked down one of three expensive oil paintings owned by Mr Nadir, called Sybil and estimated to be worth Pounds 250,000. Two others - Sisters, also worth Pounds 250,000, and La Nuit a Bruges, worth about Pounds 400,000 - are still unaccounted for. 'We speculate that they may have gone abroad,' he said. Mr Cooper said there were also numerous antiques, valuable artefacts, properties and investments overseas held by Mr Nadir which he had been unable to recover. He said there were about 20 trusts and companies in offshore centres including the Isle of Man and Liechtenstein in which Mr Nadir had interests. 'He more or less ignored the bankruptcy,' Mr Cooper said. Letters sometimes went unanswered and information which had been requested was not provided. 'His memory was obviously not what it used to be.' So far Mr Cooper has managed to realise less than Pounds 100,000 in assets.</p>

			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / NAO queries Pounds 40m Tec funds THE National Audit Office has questioned the accounts of the Department of Employment for the third consecutive year and found that more than Pounds 21m of payments to Training and Enterprise Councils and the Employment Service were incorrectly made. There is disagreement over a further Pounds 19m. The payments in 1991-92 were among those made to employer-led Tecs and the government's Employment Service. In the previous year, incorrect payments totalled Pounds 53m. Tecs are responsible for payments to about 4,000 providers of training for young people and unemployed adults on the two main national training programmes, Youth Training and Employment Training. The Employment Service pays allowances to unemployed adults on ET. The total cost of the two programmes was Pounds 1.5bn in 1991-92. Among the lapses of financial control identified by the government's spending watchdog were: paying youth trainees after their training had ceased; claiming payments for vocational qualifications not gained in the appropriate year; and allowing claims that were not adequately substantiated. Inadequate documentary evidence to support claims was a chief complaint by the NAO. Tecs themselves complain about the complexity of audit trails imposed upon them. The report says: 'This arose from confusion regarding the evidence required for qualifications and the problems relating to satisfactory and timely documentation.' In addition, there were claims that Tecs thought they had made legitimately but which appeared to the Internal Audit to be ineligible. One Tec claimed Pounds 153,000 for vocational qualifications gained by trainees between 1984 and 1989 - before the advent of the Tec. The department, commenting on the report, said it was implementing a plan for 100 per cent financial control by the end of March 1993. Report by the Comptroller and Auditor General.

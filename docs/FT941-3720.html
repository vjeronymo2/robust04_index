			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Clearing up an esoteric banking point Sir, Ms Isabel Ashman (Letters, March 10), like many others, may have been confused by the, at times esoteric, debate on the clearing cycle. There are two elements which have been confused: first, 'the amount of time it takes before (a bank) pays interest on a cheque' ('Lloyds gives way on cheque clearing', March 4) and, second, the amount of time before a customer can use the funds. Your article was correct in saying that Lloyds, Midland and NatWest will pay interest two working days after the deposit of a cheque, which has long been Barclays' practice. However, as cheques can still bounce after that time, it takes longer until customers can use the money. There are still variations between the banks, but the length of time cited by Miss Ashman sounds correct for the circumstances at Barclays. The bank is introducing new technology this year which will reduce the clearing time for similar deposits.

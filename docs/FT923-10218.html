			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / Space station project kept alive by House THE US HOUSE of Representatives has voted to keep alive the Dollars 40bn American space station project, despite criticism both of its cost and of its scientific utility. Although opponents of the costly project had hoped their cause would profit from a new eagerness to tackle extravagant government spending, the House voted 237:181 (almost exactly the same margin as a year ago) against cancelling the station. 'In difficult economic times, the Congress stood up and did what's right for the future,' said Mr Daniel Goldin, administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa), who has led ferocious lobbying to preserve the space station. But Congressman David Obey charged that many in Congress had been swayed by Nasa contracts placed in their districts. Even so, the House voted only Dollars 1.7bn for the space station in the 1993 fiscal year - Dollars 500m less than the Bush administration had requested. A Senate committee yesterday voted Dollars 2.1bn for the project, which would probably fall behind its aim to launch the station in 1995, if it received only the Dollars 1.7bn agreed by the House.</p>

The 1,800-megawatt facility,  which will sell 70 per cent of its power to Hong Kong, is just  20 kilometres from the Sai Kung peninsula and 50 km from  Central. But senior police officers admitted last week that  problems still had to be ironed out and agreements reached with  mainland officials. They would keep their "fingers crossed"  until plans were finalised, they said.    Secretary for Security Alistair Asprey, whose department is  co-ordinating the contingency plans, is expected at the opening  of China's second and largest nuclear plant. However, a  Security Branch spokesman said negotiators were still trying to  secure a pledge from China to notify the territory of any  on-site accidents. The two sides would talk again in Guangdong  later this month.    Meanwhile, Marine North Division commander Herbert Au  Hok-lam, a key adviser on the police contingency plan, said  evacuation and safety proposals for Hong Kong were "never meant  to be an all-embracing plan". "Let's face it, it's still in the  planning stage. Not every problem has been ironed out. We're  still trying to work out what the problems are. We're not  professing that the plan is perfect, (but) attacking it for lack  of coverage or adequacy, or inadequacy, is not constructive," he  said.    The Royal Hong Kong Police's Chief Staff Officer  (Administration), Peter Cummings, said there was a basic plan of  action in case of emergency, but it contained "a lot of  alternative possibilities" and some details had yet to be  determined. "By and large we do have everything planned -- we  just have to keep our fingers crossed that nothing happens," Mr  Cummings said.    Police planners, led by Marine North Division, were  concentrating on Mirs Bay and Ping Chau island, 12 km from Daya  Bay, he explained. The small island in Hong Kong's remote  northeast attracts thousands of teenage campers and picnickers  at summer weekends. "If there was a disaster at Daya Bay, it  would be the Mirs Bay and Ping Chau areas that would be  affected," Mr Cummings said. "If it's a weekday, there's hardly  anybody on Ping Chau. If it's a weekend, then we've got bigger  problems because there could be a couple of thousand people  there.    "There is a provisional plan. We've got enough in hand now  to do something if we had to, but there are always going to be  differences of opinion: do you evacuate people, do you shelter  people, do you need (iodine) pills or not need pills? Nothing's  ever going to be 100 per cent satisfactory."    Mr Au said he had travelled to Ping Chau after the SUNDAY  MORNING POST revealed the island's marine police had been issued  iodine pills. Ping Chau police said they had received bottles  of potassium iodine pills to distribute in case of a Daya Bay  accident. Unsure of what to do with the pills, the policemen  had padlocked them in the station's gun cupboard under  instructions from the Police Public Relations Bureau to shield  them from view. "They were never meant to be kept in a  secretive manner," Mr Au said. "They have to be administered as  soon as possible ... they are meant to be kept in first aid  boxes. I double checked that the iodine tablets were in the  first aid box, not in the arms cupboard." The tablets fight the  absorption of radioactive iodine after a nuclear accident and  have been distributed to police at Tap Mun, Kat O, Ping Chau and  Marine North Division.    Ping Chau police, faced with the prospect of rounding up  thousands of teenage picnickers with loud hailers, said they had  expected a test run. But Mr Au said Ping Chau visitors would  not be forewarned by government notices or police, and no test  run had been planned. "You have to look at it from a pragmatic  point of view -- you're looking at something that may not  happen," Mr Au said. "I'm not in the process of arranging any  test runs of administering the pills. (In an emergency) we would  have to round up (picnickers) and warn them that something's  happened.    "We would face the problem of evacuating them, arranging for  transport, ensure they are kept in an orderly manner and ensure  they can be taken to a place where they can be examined and, if  they have been subjected to radiation, treated accordingly."    Daya Bay campaigner, the Reverend Fung Chi-wood yesterday  called for the reactor to be shut down, saying the contingency  plans failed to provide adequate protection. The United  Democrats member and spokesman for the Joint Conference for the  Sheltering of the Daya Bay Nuclear Plant said the group was now  urgently pressing for the closure. "The nuclear plant poses so  much of a threat to Hong Kong that it should cease operating,"  he said. The Guangdong Nuclear Power Joint Venture Company has  invited hundreds of government, business and media figures to  watch Mr Li open the $31 million Daya Bay plant this morning.</p>

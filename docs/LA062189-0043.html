			<p><P> June 21, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ELDER GALLO BROTHERS WIN BITTER TRADEMARK LAWSUIT  </P> <P> Ernest and Julio Gallo retained exclusive control of their family's trademark  name when a federal judge in Fresno on Tuesday ordered the wine makers' younger  brother, Joseph Gallo, to stop using his own name on a brand of cheese.  </P> <P> Ending a rancorous, insult-trading public dispute among members of the normally  publicity-shy Gallo clan, U.S. District Judge Robert E. Coyle said in his  61-page order that the younger Gallo actively and unfairly schemed to exploit  the valuable name recognition his brothers had cultivated over the last 30  years.  </P> <P> In the course of the legal battle, the wine-making Gallos accused their brother  of running a rat-infested cheese plant; lawyers for Joseph Gallo, the cheese  maker, countered with accusations that his brothers made cheap wine to sell to  drunks.  </P> <P> The judge brushed aside the argument that Joseph Gallo has the right to his own  name as a trademark, noting that because of his own misleading advertising  "there is substantial evidence of actual confusion" among both retailers and  consumers who thought the wines and cheeses were made by the same company.  </P> <P> Critical to the case were some notes made by a Joseph Gallo Farms marketing  strategist, which the judge said confirmed the cheese maker's determination "to  capitalize on the Gallo name and image" -- an image cultured with $300 million  worth of advertising over the years.  </P> <P> Even without that argument, the judge said, the wine-making Gallos had taken  great care to develop a unique image, one they should not have to forsake only  because theirs is a relatively common Italian name.  </P> <P> "If every person named Gallo were entitled to use Gallo as a consumer  trademark, Gallo might be adopted as a trademark on any imaginable product,"  the judge wrote. "Such proliferation of uses would destroy the unique nature of  the Gallo brand, its distinctiveness and its commercial value."  </P> <P> Coyle's order, filed Monday and made public Tuesday, gives the Joseph Gallo  Cattle Co. of Livingston, Calif., 30 days to cease using "Joseph Gallo" as a  trademark for its cheeses. However, his order lets the company use the name in  less conspicuous type as long as a new brand name or logo is used as well.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Jury  </P> <P> The judge spent six months preparing the legal opinion after presiding over a  monthlong trial in Fresno that ended just before Christmas last year. There was  no jury in the case because the older Gallos did not seek monetary damages --  only an order stopping their brother from using the family name.  </P> <P> Joseph Gallo, who was rebuffed in September in a related legal effort to claim  a one-third share in the winery started by his older brothers, declined to  comment on the ruling. The 69-year-old rancher's lawyer, Denis Rice of San  Francisco, said he will advise his client to appeal the decision.  </P> <P> The reclusive Ernest and Julio Gallo, 80 and 79 years old, also had no comment  on the ruling. However, they insisted from the start that their lawsuit was  filed without malice to protect their trademark and the company, Consolidated  Foods, that is licensed to make Gallo-brand salami in cooperation with the  winery.  </P> <P> At the same time, their company -- E &amp; J Gallo Winery of Modesto, Calif.,  by far the world's largest wine maker -- issued a two-sentence statement: "The  court has ruled in our favor, after extensive review of all the facts and law  in the case. We are pleased the matter has been brought to a conclusion."  </P> <P> During the trial, relations among the brothers was not so decorous.  </P> <P> The elder Gallos said they had offered their brother a royalty-free license to  use the family name if only he would allow regular inspections of his plant by  the winery -- just as the other licensee was checked. But Joseph refused, so  his brothers produced an expert trial witness who characterized Joseph Gallo's  cheese operation as shoddy and rodent-infested.  </P> <P> Joseph Gallo fired back by threatening to sue Ernest for slander, while his  lawyers used their own experts to shoot down the tainted-cheese innuendo. They  also challenged the quality of some of Ernest and Julio's wines, including the  cheap, fortified "Thunderbird" and "Night Train" brands said to be favored by  many street drunks.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Father Killed Mother  </P> <P> Such rancor was not always the way with the Gallos. After their father shot and  killed their mother and then took his own life in 1933, the elder brothers  raised Joseph themselves while starting up their wine-making empire with grapes  from the family vineyard.  </P> <P> When Joseph was old enough, he became vineyard manager. He held the job for 18  years before striking off on his own as a grape grower and dairy cattleman not  far away. He still sells wine grapes to his brothers.  </P> <P> Six years ago, Joseph Gallo expanded his dairy operation and built a cheese  plant near Atwater, Calif. After a year of selling bulk cheese to other  packagers, he began marketing his own Joseph Gallo brand Cheddar and Monterey  jack cheeses. Cheese sales reached $30 million a year by 1987.  </P> <P> That success proved problematical when Joseph Gallo's cheese making appeared to  be infringing on the expensive and exclusive cheese-making license his elder  brothers had sold to another firm much earlier. When terse, tense negotiations  failed, Ernest and Julio Gallo sued in April of 1986.  </P> <P> Joseph Gallo countersued four months later, asserting that his parents intended  for him to share equally in the family vineyards that later grew into the  billion-dollar-a-year winery. U.S. District Judge Edward Dean Price dismissed  the suit, wryly noting that the best witness, the brothers' late father, "was  out of reach of the court's process."  </P></p>

			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Australia and South Korea rise BUYING INTEREST lifted the Australian and South Korean markets yesterday, but investors were in arush to take profits in Taiwan. Most other markets were mixed and without direction, partly owing to the closure of Tokyo for the first of its Golden Week holidays; it will also shut this Friday and Monday next week. AUSTRALIA advanced on buying by US and domestic investors, encouraged by expectations of lower inflation and interest rates. The All Ordinaries index moved ahead 20.4 to 1,558.3 in turnover of ADollars 259m, similar to Thursday's level but below Friday's ADollars 712m,which was boosted by options-related trading. There was active buying ofBHP, which rose 40 cents to ADollars 12.70, and CRA, the mining group, up 55 cents at ADollars 13.80. Bundaberg Sugar, the subject of a ADollars 4.10 a share bid from Tate and Lyle, fell 11 cents to ADollars 3.85 after saying that Macquarie Bank had valued thecompany at between ADollars 4.54 and ADollars 5.16 a share. SEOUL enjoyed its third successive session of strength, with the composite index climbing 5.89 to 644.60. Trading was active with Won171bn worth of shares exchanged, up from Saturday's Won112bn. Rumours of a possible summit between the North-South Korean leaders encouraged investors. TAIWAN fell sharply in the most active day's trading since last June, as profit-taking weakened financial and textile shares. The weighted index lost 260.25 or 4.3 per cent to 5,728.00 in turnover of TDollars 106bn, up from Saturday's TDollars 59bn. MANILA consolidated before the talks on US militarybases in the Philippines. The composite index retreated 14.62 to 1,033.56 as turnover increased to 91m pesos from 86m. HONG KONG recouped most of its early losses to close little changed. The Hang Seng index was finally off 1.08 at 3,624.72 after turnover of HKDollars 1.02bn, down from HKDollars 1.47bn. SINGAPORE was also mixed, the Straits Times Industrial index ending 0.23 up at 1,558.64.</p>

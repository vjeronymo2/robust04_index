			<p>BFN     [Text] Canberra, June 23 (XINHUA) -- Visiting Chinese State  Councilor Li Tieying said today that China has confidence in  re-entering the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).    Speaking at the Australia-China Business Council in  Melbourne  today, Li said that the Chinese Government has adopted a series  of major reform measures since talks started on China's  resumption of its GATT membership in 1986.    He said that China "will fulfill its due obligations and its  economic and trade systems will be further integrated with the  international ones" once China's GATT membership is resumed.    With the support of the majority of the signatories,  including Australia, Li said that the talks "have now entered  the substantive stage where protocols are being negotiated."    Li, who is also minister in charge of the State Commission  for Restructuring the Economic Systems, arrived in Melbourne  this morning for a nine-day visit to Australia after ending his  tour to New Zealand.    On the economic cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region, Li  said that the principle of "mutual respect, equality and mutual  benefit, opening up to each other and common prosperity" should  be complied with.</p>

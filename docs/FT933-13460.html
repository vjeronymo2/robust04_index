			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Consumer products Just as the market had almost persuaded itself that the Marlboro cigarette price cuts reflected unique pressures, along comes Procter &amp; Gamble and attacks detergent prices. P&amp;G's campaign may have the specific intention of forestalling the rise of private labels in the US. But combined with similar moves elsewhere from Heinz and BSN, it suggests consumer products manufacturers are now expending mighty efforts to drive down prices, thereby reversing the cosy industry trend of the 1980s. Low inflation, slow growth, intensifying competition and heightened consumer perceptions of value are squeezing brands' premium prices. Price deflation has already made life painful in other industries, such as oil. Such pressures apply not only to manufacturers but also to distributors. Shareholders in the slipping sands of the UK food retailing sector may have further reason to question their footing. Decelerating inflation is reducing profits expectations. The fierceness of the big three grocers' fight against Costco's planning application for a warehouse club highlights their worries about lower-margin competitors. The leading superstore operators suggest gross margins are now levelling out after many years of successive rises. Given that new stores generate higher-than-average gross margins, this implies those from existing stores are already sliding. Earnings and dividend growth from the sector may still average 8-9 per cent over the next few years. That may seem parsimonious when compared with the rates of growth in 1980s. The market, though, seems to be discounting a lot worse.</p>

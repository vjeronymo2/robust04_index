Velasquez' last Council of  Ministers meeting was being held at Miraflores Palace, Vice  Admiral Radames Munoz [outgoing defense minister] said that  after the statement he made yesterday he had nothing to add.  Nevertheless, he rejected the statements made about him by  reporter Jose Vicente Rangel during a television program. Here  is what Vice Admiral Radames Munoz said:    [Begin Munoz recording] If I had ever thought about staging  a  coup d'etat, I had 271 days to do so. Gentlemen, simply by  taking advantage of the incident that occurred at the  presidential palace and by arresting one parliament member I  could have staged a coup. I never perpetrated this and I never  wanted to, even though in the media there were suggestions that  I had ordered something like that. I did not do this precisely  because of my respect for the Venezuelan people and the  democratic system in which I have a firm belief. Therefore,  those accusations are groundless.

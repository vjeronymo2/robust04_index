			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Winfried Muenster commentary: "Covert Game for Power"] </F>   [Text] Greece is planning a new airport for its capital  Athens. It is part of the 26 projects chosen by the European  Commission for the expansion of the "European transportation  networks." The Commission considers no less than 250 airports  to be "of European interest," which means they are worthy of  being financially supported. Greece probably does not enjoy  enough credit on the capital markets to finance such a project.  Thus, the European Union [EU] in Brussels is supposed to help  -- to a small degree with subsidies from its budget, primarily,  however, with the excellent credit standing of its European  Investment Bank (EIB).    By the end of the decade the Brussels authority wants to  raise more than 400 billion German marks [DM] in this way for  the traffic infrastructure in the EU -- DM800 billion over the  next 15 years, and more than DM1 trillion if electricity and  telephone lines are added. One cannot reproach the officials in  Brussels for looking in the direction of their Mecca, that is,  Paris, or for thinking up a new label in the form of the  "trans-European networks," with which they hoped to intensify  the redistribution toward the south. There is also a lot going  to Germany, for instance new east-west links for high-speed  trains. It is in particular this unbiased attitude that bothers  some member states. When the finance ministers examined the list  of projects in Athens on the weekend, the Italian minister  protested against the financing plans for the east-west  direction. Rather, the EU should concentrate on the traffic  infrastructure at its periphery, which also includes the Italian  boot.    Thus, redistribution after all? The officials in Brussels  have long aroused greed with their plans, and now FRG Finance  Minister Theo Waigel and others have to recapture the genie that  has been let out of the bottle. The EU, quite certainly, has  not been passive so far. Last year alone the EIB provided loans  of more than DM15 billion for traffic, energy, and  telecommunications networks. Therefore, the officials in  Brussels are not simply interested in even more capital but in  making traffic investments in the member states a matter of the  EU as soon as national borders are crossed. The issue is  authority and thus power. In this connection, it is quite  appropriate that the EU has forced its member states to save  money, a constraint by which it does not consider itself bound.  If the governments want to fulfill the criteria for qualifying  for the monetary union, they have no room for further deficits.  Brussels, on the other hand, would enter deficit management on  a grand scale.</p>

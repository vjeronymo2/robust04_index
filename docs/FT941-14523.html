			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / Tough pay freeze foreseen The government's proposed freeze on the pay bill for 4.5m public-sector employees could be tougher than expected judging by details uncovered in the commons treasury and civil service committee's report on the budget. Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the treasury, made clear to the committee that the freeze on pay bills was separate from the freeze on running costs, so savings from running costs could not finance a pay rise. many employers and union leaders had hoped it would be possible to subsidise pay rises from both and had expected rises of up to 3 per cent in 1994-95. This clarification means that a pay rise for civil servants, for example, can come only from the pounds 11.7bn pay bill and not the pounds 20.1bn total running costs for central government departments in 1994-95. The trades union congress said last night that restriction made big job losses in the public sector more likely. Mr Portillo also had some direct words for the pay review bodies which make pay rise recommendations for about 1.5m workers. 'They (the review bodies) need to understand that there is a freeze on pay bills, that there is a freeze on running costs,' he said. 'If what they propose is to be acceptable it has got to be an increase which can be funded out of efficiency. 'If it goes beyond that then the implication would either be that their proposal would not be acceptable or that their increase could only be made at the expense of delivery of services'. This may dismay some members of pay review bodies who believe their job is to set pay levels regardless of government targets.</p>

			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Television and Radio Review: Begin and end with films - Sunday For me the day will begin with one old movie and end with another, both on Channel 4. Wings (1.25pm) is a 1927 silent, famous for its aerial photography. Richard Arlen and Charles Rogers play young men who join the US Army Air Corps during the first world war, and there is the added attraction of Clara Bow as an ambulance driver. This was the first winner of an Oscar for Best Picture. Animal Crackers, part of C4's Marx Brothers season, their second film, was made only three years later, yet it seems to inhabit a different world. This is the one where Groucho plays Captain Spaulding and tells Margaret Dumont 'You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen, which doesn't say much for you.' (12.45 am). Conductor Claudio Abbado told television director Christopher Swann: 'I would like you to make a film of my Peter And The Wolf recording using those Spitting Image puppets.' So Swann did. Thirty puppets, many life size, were created by Roger Law, and the voices are provided by Roy Hudd, who plays Prokofiev, and the members of Theatre de Complicite (4.25pm BBC2). That is followed by the new plasticene animation film The Wrong Trousers, 'starring' Wallace and Gromit, the creations of animator Nick Park (5.20pm). That in turn is followed by Porgy And Bess (5.50pm), a three-hour recording of Trevor Nunn's highly-praised 1986 Glyndebourne production. The Harmfulness Of Tobacco is a dramatisation of a Chekhov short story. Edward Fox plays a harassed husband who, while giving a boring speech, begins to reveal his inner feelings about his home life (8.30pm C4).</p>

Bozhko, Rostov-na-Donu Antiplague Scientific  Research Institute; UDC 616.9-078.33:615.373:616-078]    [Text] The reaction of coagglutination on glass, which is  being used successfully to detect and identify bacteria,  viruses, soluble antigens, and toxins, has gained widespread  popularity in our country and abroad. The possibility of also  using it to detect the causative agents of dangerous infectious  diseases has also been demonstrated in principle (V.S. Rybkin,  1983; G.M. Orlova et al., 1986; Yu.A. Belaya, 1987; T.M.  Grizhebovskiy, et al., 1987; O.V. Sivkova, 1988). Our industry  does not produce the respective diagnosticums, however. Such  preparations are also needed to detect and identify isolated  cultures and conduct accelerated analyses, especially under  field conditions, in emergencies, and during mass studies.    This communication is devoted to the development of plague  tularemia, cholera, glanders, and melioidosis dry  coagglutinating diagnosticums and to the study of their use in  different stages of bacteriologic investigation.    Vaccine and virulent strains of bacteria of the respective  species were used to prepare the antigens in the experiments,  and strains of various heterologous microorganisms were used to  study the resultant preparations' specificity. The optimum  schemes of producing rabbit immune sera were selected for each  diagnosticum. Dry commercial staphylococcal reagent (produced by  the Leningrad Epidemiology and Microbiology Scientific Research  Institute imeni Pasteur) were sensitized by using native sera in  accordance with recommendations. The amount of sensitizing agent  and duration of sensitization were selected individually for  each diagnosticum. For a working dilution, researchers used a  dilution equal to half the maximum resulting in a preparation  efficiently agglutinating homologous antigens.    The liquid diagnosticums were lyophilized in a  saccharose-gelatin medium. Equipment produced by Friger  (Czechosolvakia) was used.    When setting up the reaction, researchers applied a drop of  prepared microbial suspension onto clean degreased glass, added  a drop of dissolved preparation, mixed it, and examined it  against a dark background. They checked for the absence of  spontaneous agglutination of the diagnosticum and suspension of  study cultures. The result was calculated over 5 minutes; a  response to 4+ and 3+ was considered positive.    Three versions of plague diagnosticums were developed on the  basis of different sera, i.e., diagnosticums to whole live  microbial cells of the vaccine strain EV 1290, to the somatic  antigen (fraction V) of the acapsular atoxic version of the same  strain, and to fraction I of Yersinia pestis. The  specific activity of these preparations was studied in  experiments on 80 capsular and 14 acapsular strains of plague  microbe grown at 28 and 37C. The first preparation  agglutinated bacteria of the homologous type of typical and  atypical acapsular strains in a concentration of 10[.sup]7[/]  microbe cells/ml and higher. The activity of the second  preparation was on the same level; however, the formation of  finer agglutinate with incomplete clarification of the fluid was  frequently observed. The third preparation detected only  capsular versions of plague causative agent. The reaction was  clearer with bacteria grown at 37C, and its sensitivity  reached 10[.sup]6[/] microbe cells/ml with selected strains.  Only the third preparation possessed strict species specificity,  whereas the first and second preparations also reacted with  selected strains of pseudotuberculosis causative agent.    Several versions of group-specific cholera diagnosticums  with  various characteristics in relation to Vibrio  cholerae 01 and non-01 were prepared. The rabbits were  immunized by intravenous injection of suspensions of daily  cultures of different strains of V. cholerae 01  subjected to prolonged boiling. Conditions to produce a highly  specific preparation were selected. Reaction sensitivity ranged  from 10[.sup]6[/] to 10[.sup]8[/] microbe cells/ml  depending on the strain. Coagglutination was not observed with  V. cholerae non-01. The diagnosticum's high  specificity during identification of cultures isolated during  the 1990 cholera outbreak was demonstrated.    To obtain a tularemia diagnosticum, animals were immunized  with a 3x intravenous suspension of formalin-killed  Francisella tularensis of the vaccine strain 15. In a  study of five series of preparation using 96 strains of  tularemia causative agent, including freshly isolated agent, the  sensitivity of reaction with formalin-treated suspensions ranged  from 10 to 10[.sup]-1[/] units based on standard turbidity  and from 10 to 10[.sup]-2[/] units with boiling. With  heterologous strains of different species of bacteria, no  positive reaction was noted.    The antigen relationship of the causative agents of glanders  and melioidosis and their serological cross-reactions make  identification and differentiation of these bacteria difficult.  Immune sera obtained to corpuscular antigens of each of the  species agglutinated bacteria of both species. Cross-reactions  were successfully eliminated by adsorbing melioidosis serum with  glanders antigen, whereas depletion of glanders serum by  melioidosis bacteria resulted in a loss of its activity. The  melioidosis diagnosticum thus acquired strict species  specificity, whereas the glanders diagnosticum agglutinated  bacteria of both homologous strains and most strains of  melioidosis causative agent. The reaction's sensitivity ranged  from 10[.sup]7[/] to 10[.sup]9[/] microbe cells/ml.  Simultaneous use of the two diagnosticums during serologic  identification of the causative agents of melioidosis and  glanders makes it possible to differentiate the species.    In a study of the reaction of coagglutination of individual  colonies grown on dense culture media or elective colonies with  seeding of pure or mixed cultures, the diagnosticums clearly  detected the respective colonies, which permitted rapid  serologic identification and a reduction in analysis time. In a  study of coagglutination reactions, the biological material of  animals containing tularemia causative agent were subjected to  boiling and centrifugation. This eliminated nonspecific  reactions, and in all cases, tularemia antigen was detected in a  suspension of the organs of animals that had died after  infection. The tularemia diagnosticum was used in studying field  material during epizooty of this infection. The positive results  in the coagglutination reaction were always confirmed by  isolating cultures. No false-positive reactions were observed.  The possibility of detecting cholera vibrios in feces and the  possibility of detecting the causative agents of glanders and  melioidosis in mixed cultures after enrichment of the material  on elective media were demonstrated under experimental  conditions.    The set of dry coagglutinating diagnosticums consisting of  plague, tularemia, cholera, glanders, and melioidosis  preparations that was developed may be recommended for  identifying cultures, screening colonies, and detecting  causative agents in biological material and in an external  medium during an accelerated analysis process, as well as in  quick analysis.

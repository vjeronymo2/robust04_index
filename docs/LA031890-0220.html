			<p><P> March 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEASURING A GOOD SERIES  </P> <P> The Writers Guild of America appreciates good writing, whether or not it  surfaces on a major network. Proof is the WGA nomination of "Measure of a Man,"  a beautiful script by Melinda M. Snodgrass for "Star Trek: The Next  Generation." Now perhaps those behind the Emmy nominations will recognize the  simply exquisite acting of Patrick Stewart, as well as the talents of the other  people responsible for this fine series, one which consistently presents  entertaining drama with comedic touches.  </P> <P> Lynne Page, Thousand Oaks  </P></p>

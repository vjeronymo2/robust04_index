Gen Wimon was apparently upset about Gen Chawalit's remark  on  Friday that another military coup d'etat cannot be ruled out.    Asked about conflicts between the Senate and the Lower House  of Parliament over proposed charter amendments, Gen Chawalit  said that soldiers would be first to come out if they felt the  country is threatened.    However, he denied having said this the next day.    Speaking at Don Muang Airport on his return from India, Gen  Wimon said that people should not take any notice of what Gen  Chawalit says.    He said Gen Chawalit is afraid of his own shadow and tends  to  have nightmares.    Deputy House Speaker Thawin Phraison said he is optimistic  that Thai soldiers will not stage another coup, because if they  did the country would greatly suffer.    Mr Thawin, who is a Phalang Tham Party (PDP) executive, said  he was "stunned" by Gen Chawalit's remark, which was also  heavily attacked yesterday by a meeting of about 200  Confederation for Democracy (CFD) members from across the  country in Bangkok.    Key CFD members said Gen Chawalit should make more  constructive comments.    Somsak Kosaisuk, a CFD leader, said Gen Chawalit should not  have made such an ambiguous remark.    "I don't think soldiers will (stage another coup), because  they are patriotic.    "They would not do something that would damage the country,  and even if they did, they would be opposed by all  democracy-loving organisations," he claimed.    Dr San Hatthirat said there should be no more coups because  military leaders have shown a clear commitment to democracy.    The best way of preventing a coup is government  decentralisation, he added.    Dr Weng Tochirakan said that although Gen Chawalit has the  right to make such remarks, he should be more helpful.    "I think that no matter how bad a problem is, it should be  solved through democratic means. Nobody should talk about a  coup carelessly.    "If there is another coup, people all over the country would  oppose it. Thailand's past coups have done enough damage to the  country. There should be no more," he said.    Gen Chawalit was army chief prior to joining the Chatchai  Chunhawan government briefly as deputy prime minister. [passage  omitted]</p>

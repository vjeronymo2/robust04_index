			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / People: Tibbett and Britten's ambition overseas Two non-executive directors appointed by Tibbett and Britten illustrate both the distribution and logistics group's continuing relationship with Unilever, and its growing international ambitions. Michael Johnson, 59, retired as head of information technology for Unilever in January, after 30 years with the Anglo-Dutch consumer products group. For the last three years he was responsible for Unilever's IT policies, designed to take advantage of the capability of open systems. Ivan Kingston, 60, is currently chairman of Malmgren Golt Kingston, a consultancy which advises government and commerce on international trading policy and related regulatory issues. He has particular expertise in market access in Japan, North America and the EC. John Harvey, chairman and chief executive of Tibbett &amp; Britten, was a Unilever director before he led the buy-out of his company from Unilever and Van Gend &amp; Loos (the Dutch railways) in 1984. He said: 'I have known Michael and Ivan for many years. They each bring wide international and specialist experience to the board, which will prove invaluable as our growth continues.' Since the buy-out, and flotation in 1986, Tibbett and Britten has maintained close links with Unilever. Last year the UK represented more than 90 per cent of Tibbett and Britten's revenue, but by the end of 1993, overseas operations will account for more than 25 per cent of turnover.</p>

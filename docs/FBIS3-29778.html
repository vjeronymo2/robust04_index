			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] During a House of Representatives Budget Committee  meeting on the afternoon of 21 February, Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa referred to the issue of reviewing the "National  Defense Program Guidelines" (which were endorsed by the cabinet  in 1976). He said: "It has been almost 20 years since the  concept of basic defense power was formulated (since the present  defense program guidelines were drawn up). I think it is  necessary to rethink basic defense power in a way that is  relative for this new era. We should basically change our  viewpoints in the present vast flow." In this way, Hosokawa  clarified his plan to drastically review the "concept of basic  defense power," which is the basis of the present defense  buildup program. Hosokawa was answering a question by Sohei  Miyashita (a member of the Liberal Democratic Party).    Basic defense power is stipulated as the minimum defense  capability that Japan, as an independent state, should maintain  in peace time. It has been explained that "basic defense power  is not something that directly confronts possible military  threats imposed on Japan." Hosokawa's remarks in the session  will likely create a great stir because they note the need for  drastically reviewing the National Defense Prorgram Guidelines,  including the "basic concept" of the defense buildup, and they  are not in line with explanations given by former governments.    Hosokawa also indicated the intention to have his private  consultative body come to a conclusion on new defense program  guidelines as early as this summer, and expressed the hope that  "the conclusion will be reflected in some way in the defense  buildup for fiscal 1995." However, Kazuo Aichi, director  general of the Defense Agency, advanced an opinion differing  from Hosokawa's. He said: "In view of the actual situation, it  will be very difficult to completely change the defense program  in the fiscal 1995 budget."    LDP's Miyashita also asked a question regarding the issue of  how participation by the Self-Defense Forces [SDF] in UN  peacekeeping operations (PKO) should be evaluated in the SDF's  duties. He said: "There is an opinion that Article 3 of the SDF  Law should be amended to rank PKO missions as the SDF's main  duty. What do you think of this?" In reply, Hosokawa said:  "The government should bring this issue before the people  first. After the people have fully discussed the matter, the  government should begin to study it." In this way, he indicated  the intention to handle the issue carefully.</p>

			<p><P> March 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUNCIL IS 'BEST SHOW IN TOWN'  </P> <P> Despite a stormy protest by residents of Monterey Park's Highlands  neighborhood, the City Council has approved the sale of city land on the west  side of the Long Beach Freeway to Los Angeles County for construction of a  children's dependency court.  </P> <P> The negotiations have been under way for two years, generally without the  public's knowledge. The deal seemed to have been set between the city and the  county by the time a hearing was held on March 13 at a City Council meeting.  </P> <P> Mayor Barry Hatch and other City Council members depicted themselves as sincere  listeners. Opponents had a hero in Councilman Christopher Houseman, who was  reluctant to join the deception.  </P> <P> Each council member in turn expressed his or her compassion for abused children  and took credit as the savior of these unfortunate children. The hard reality  of dealing with the influx of over 1,000 disturbed people and other criminal  elements each day to our small city was missing.  </P> <P> The City Council is full of humor, passion, warmth, flag-waving and good acting  to make the meetings the best show in town. No admission charged.  </P> <P> KEN IKENAGA  </P> <P> Monterey Park  </P></p>

			<p>921102 FT  02 NOV 92 / City self-regulation may erode: SIB chairman says more aggressive monitoring is necessary regulation by practitioners for practitioners - could be eroded, following a review of the power and methods of the Securities and Investments Board, the financial regulator. Mr Andrew Large, the SIB's chairman, said that his investigation, commissioned by the Treasury, is far more wide-ranging than is widely believed. He said there would be a 'clear shift to a less self-regulatory basis'. He added that he may ask the government for sweeping new powers to mount civil litigation against alleged City wrongdoers, along the lines of the powers held by the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Separately, Mr Large is examining whether it is appropriate for the Stock Exchange to retain its regulatory responsibilities, for listing shares and tracking suspected insider dealing, or whether these responsibilities should be transferred to the SIB. Transferring these roles could both boost the SIB's standing in the City and also allow the exchange to concentrate on its prime role of maintaining an efficient market. Mr Large stressed he was some way from making a recommendation on this question. In July, Mr Norman Lamont, the Chancellor, asked Mr Large to undertake a review of how the SIB carries out its responsibilities under the Financial Services Act. The review was, in part, prompted by the failure of City regulators to prevent Mr Robert Maxwell from looting the pension funds of his companies. Mr Large, who plans to submit his report in March, said he was 'concerned that the enforcement procedures are too complex and fragmented and that punishments have not been enough'. He believes the self-regulatory organisations (SROs), which have direct responsibility below the SIB for supervising securities and investment firms, should levy bigger fines on firms which break City rules. But he is concerned that prosecuting alleged frauds through the courts is slow and the outcome uncertain. He said that in cases of market manipulation - either insider dealing or other unfair methods of profiting from share price movements - the SIB should perhaps have powers to mount civil prosecutions. Market manipulation and insider trading are criminal offences, but the burden of proof required for a successful prosecution in a civil case is far less than in a criminal case. Mr Large hopes to make the SIB and the SROs more aggressive in monitoring of financial firms and the pursuit of fraud. He said financial practitioners had played an important role in shaping regulations in the four years since the Financial Services Act came into force. He said a 'different sort of person' was necessary now that the regulators' work was not to write rules but to ensure they are obeyed. Two important issues under review are whether financial firms should lose their right to choose which SRO should regulate them and whether the SIB should give up direct regulation of firms and concentrate on being the regulators' regulator. Mr Large said the authority of the SIB may be diminished by its inability to decide the membership, or scope, of an SRO. The question of whether financial firms should be free to choose their SRO has become contentious over the summer, because the big UK banks, currently supervised by the SIB, are refusing to join an SRO, called the Personal Investment Authority, which would streamline the regulation of retail financial services. Interviews with Andrew Large, SIB chairman, and Richard Breeden, SEC chairman, will appear tomorrow. SIB rethink, Page 10</p>

			<p><P> September 26, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> AMERICANS' MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME INCHES UP 1.3% IN '89  </P> <P> Americans' median household income rose 1.3% in 1989, after adjusting for the  rise in consumer prices, the Census Bureau reported today. The increase  followed two years in which income had been unchanged.  </P> <P> In a report based on a survey of 58,000 U.S. households in March, the bureau  also reported that the nation's poverty rate last year was 12.8%, about the  same as in 1988. That means 31.5 million Americans were living in poverty in  1989.  </P> <P> The poverty rate has declined since 1983 but remains higher than it was in  1978, the recent low point, the report said.  </P> <P> The median income for all households was $28,910.  </P> <P> Black household income was up 5% to $18,080, but Latino and white median  incomes were unchanged.  </P> <P> The median earnings of all women working full time increased 1.8% to $18,780,  while the earnings of men decreased by the same percentage to $27,430.  </P></p>

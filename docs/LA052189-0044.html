			<p><P> May 21, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WEST COVINA MAN HOPES TO LAUNCH REVOLT AGAINST TAX FOR LANDSCAPING  </P> <P> Frank Barbagallo is hardly a tax revolter to rival Howard Jarvis and Paul Gann,  the pair who upset the state's political landscape in the late 1970s.  </P> <P> But the 33-year-old West Covina resident wants to start a taxpayer's revolt  that would affect the city budget much like Proposition 13, which slashed local  property taxes.  </P> <P> Barbagallo says West Covina is misusing more than $1.5 million in annual taxes  collected from hundreds of homeowners for landscaping. Some homeowners have  been paying between $400 and $650 annually for nine years and have been getting  nothing in return, he said.  </P> <P> On Monday, Barbagallo is scheduled to address the City Council about his  concerns, and the city staff -- which denies Barbagallo's allegations -- is set  to respond.  </P> <P> "We're paying money for no services," Barbagallo said. "If you're going to  charge someone for service, you damn well better provide it."  </P> <P> The maintenance districts, established over the past 20 years in five of the  city's newer subdivisions, are intended to ensure that developers provide  greenery, which the city subsequently maintains.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Researched Records  </P> <P> After an extensive review of city records, Barbagallo said the city has spent  little or no money on landscape maintenance in his neighborhood. Although  Barbagallo said the same thing is taking place in all city maintenance  districts, his research concentrated on his East Hills neighborhood and two  adjoining tracts.  </P> <P> In his neighborhood, part of Maintenance District 6, there are 240 households  that pay a combined $130,000 to the city each year, he said. In District 7, 400  homeowners pay $200,000 annually, and in District 4 homeowners pay about $1  million in landscape assessments, he said.  </P> <P> City officials say residents are receiving all services for which they are  paying.  </P> <P> Harry W. Thomas, public works division manager, said homeowners in Barbagallo's  neighborhood are paying to maintain 91 acres of "common open space" around  their upscale, hillside homes.  </P> <P> Of the common acreage, only about eight acres are intended to have actual  landscaping and irrigation, Thomas said. The remainder is to stay in its  "natural state" with only fire prevention and other minimal maintenance, he  said.  </P> <P> "I get the impression that there may be some feeling that the whole 91-acre  area was supposed to be landscaped," Thomas said. "Since that didn't happen,  maybe there's some dissatisfaction about that."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Landscaping Slowed  </P> <P> Barbagallo said that the city has not provided brush removal or fire protection  measures in the areas designated as "natural state."  </P> <P> Thomas acknowledged that promised landscaping on the eight acres has been  slowed by a succession of home developers backing out of their commitments, but  he said the work should be completed sometime this year.  </P> <P> "What he is saying is erroneous," Barbagallo said. "You tell me where the trees  are that it (the city) is maintaining."  </P> <P> Sitting in his family's home in the hills overlooking the city, Barbagallo  recalled that he first noticed a $424 charge for "landscape maintenance"  shortly after moving to West Covina in June, 1987.  </P> <P> Pointing to barren areas where he said there are supposed to be trees, shrubs  and grass, Barbagallo questioned what the money was being used for.  </P> <P> Thomas said most of the estimated $40,000 the district spends each year pays  for that portion of city staff needed to administer the district. A fire  prevention plan is being prepared for Districts 6 and 7, he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Contingency Account  </P> <P> Since 1981, Thomas said, the leftover funds have been put in a contingency  account, which will provide for repairs in the event of a landslide in the  area. The area has a history of slides, according to city engineers. The  contingency fund will reach its $250,000 goal this year, and additional surplus  funds will probably be used to lower future taxes, he said.  </P> <P> In a report to the city, Barbagallo asked that the city collect no taxes until  significant landscaping work is completed in all of the districts.  </P></p>

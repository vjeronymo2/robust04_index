			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / China's potential emerging from behind the figures CHINA is a large country with a big economy which is getting bigger by the year. But only now is it being understood quite how large and economically powerful China could become early in the next century - provided, that is, its development is not derailed by another of the bouts of inflation that have accompanied its impressive performance. Chinese gross national product grew by an average 9 per cent a year over the last 13 years, far outstripping the growth rate of the population. The authorities may be about to put the brakes on to prevent over-heating, as at the end of the 1980s. Growth rose last year to 12 per cent, but the year-on-year inflation rate also accelerated to 15.7 per cent in the first quarter of this year. But Chinese GNP in 1994 should still be four times larger than in 1978, when market-based economic reforms began. Yet China's economic potential has been partly obscured from view by some strange World Bank statistics. According to the latest World Development Report, the dollar value of Chinese output per person has been falling over the past decade. It has dropped from Dollars 410 in 1976 to Dollars 370 in 1990 - one-sixtieth of US GNP per head. With China's population estimated at 1.13bn in 1990, total measured GNP was Dollars 410bn, smaller than that of Canada, which was Dollars 542bn, and the UK, which was Dollars 908bn. The reason for this strange result is the steep fall in the value of the yuan against the dollar since 1979. This has cut deeply into the dollar value of Chinese GNP, measured at national prices. But Chinese GNP is understated at current exchange rates because of the low prices of services relative to those in developed countries at market exchange rates. One measure of this distortion is the large size of the China's export sector relative to measured GNP. The value of Chinese exports has risen from Dollars 13.7bn in 1979 to Dollars 62bn in 1990, or 15 per cent of measured GNP. This implies that China's export/GNP ratio is twice that of the US, despite China's huge geographic size and relative isolation. World Bank officials have never denied that these statistics are misleading. In the latest issue of Global Economic Prospects for developing countries, they have provided an alternative, more realistic measure of the potential economic size of the Chinese economic area - which includes Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan, as well as China - at the beginning of the next millennium. The bank believes that China can maintain economic growth rates in excess of 7 per cent over the coming decade. Using its baseline forecasts, it estimates that CEA national output, measured at market prices, will be larger than that of the UK, Italy and France by 2002, although still only a quarter of US GNP. The picture changes dramatically if GNP is measured instead by standard international prices for both traded and non-traded goods and services. On this basis, CEA output is already larger than that of both Germany and Japan. By 2002, the bank estimates that CEA's GNP will have risen to Dollars 9,800bn, marginally larger than that of the US. Even then, GNP per head in the CEA would be lower - Dollars 7,300 compared to Dollars 36,100 in the US, Dollars 37,900 in Japan and Dollars 39,100 in Germany - but the gap would be much narrower than when measured at current exchange rates. These alternative calculations also mislead. As a measure of economic welfare or quality of life, they make sense: people in China need haircuts as much as those in the US, even if they cost far less in Beijing than in New York. But China can only convert the value of these haircuts into international goods at current exchange rates, which give little international purchasing power to those who provide them. As the Chinese economy develops, the domestic price of these non-traded goods will gradually rise relative to the internationally determined prices of traded goods. But for now, GNP measured at standardised prices, while useful for some purposes, overstates China's presence on the world economic stage.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------          INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC INDICATORS: NATIONAL ACCOUNTS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Figures for GDP/GNP are in billions of European currency units (Ecu).

Statistics for Germany apply only to western Germany. GDP/GNP is broken down into private consumption expenditure, investment (the sum of gross fixed capital formation and the change in stocks), general government final consumption, and net exports (exports of goods and services minus imports of goods and services). The US includes investment by government in the government series, rather than under investment. Quarterly GDP/GNP totals are annualised. The growth rates are the percentage change over the corresponding period in the previous year, and are positive unless otherwise stated. The figures in the fifth column of each set of growth rates refer only to exports, rather than to net exports. Data supplied by Datastream and WEFA from national government sources.</p>

			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / A-Z of Personal Finance (27): A capital idea if the cover looks right - Zero-coupon shares AN INVESTMENT which pays no income sounds like one for savers to avoid. But the peculiarities of the British tax system have made zero-coupon preference shares a much sought-after commodity in recent years. All the return from a zero comes in the form of capital growth; the share is issued at one price, and should be repaid at a much greater price in a few years' time. This profit counts, for tax purposes, as capital gain (unlike the position on zero coupon bonds, where profits are taxed as income). Since few investors use up their annual capital gains tax allowance (Pounds 5,800 in 1992-93), the profits are likely to be tax-free. How do zeros work? They are one class of share within a split-capital investment trust. A split trust invests in shares in the same way as other investment trusts, and so repayment of the zero ultimately depends on the health of the stock market. However, zeros have first claim on the assets of a trust and are thus relatively 'safe', although they are still significantly more risky than a gilt. The key statistic for judging safety is 'cover'. This measures whether the current assets of the trust are sufficient to repay the final value of the zeros. If cover is over 100 per cent, then the trust's assets will need to fall before there will be any risk to full zero repayment. You can only really find out the cover level from a stockbroker, which illustrates how good advice is vital in this area. Greater risk demands greater reward. So, normally speaking, the 'safer' a zero, the lower the rate of return. SG Warburg's Private Investor Guide shows, for example, that at the end of November, the gross redemption yield on River Plate's zeros (cover 215 per cent) was 7.09 per cent, while the yield on M&amp;G Recovery zeros (cover 58 per cent) was 11.4 per cent. So when choosing a zero, the investor has to make a choice between safety and return. A second point to consider is the maturity date. You may have some financial commitment (school fees or a child's wedding) to meet. Zeros can be used as part of a 'back-to-back' plan with an income-producing security such as a temporary annuity. The annuity generates a high income; meanwhile, the zero grows steadily to repay the annuity capital. Taken together, the two instruments are more tax-efficient than a conventional building society account would be. Because of the expansion of the split-capital trust sector in the late 1980s, there is a wealth of maturities on offer. Some will not be paid until the next millennium; others will mature in 1995. A third point to remember is that short-term risks are involved. Although there is an element of certainty about the final redemption value, there are no guarantees about the day-to-day trading price of a zero. Zeros behave rather like bonds; their prices rise and fall in inverse correlation to interest rates. So if interest rates rise, the price of a zero will normally fall in the short term, as investors sell the zero to buy better-yielding assets elsewhere. A sharp fall in the stock market might also cause the price of a zero to fall, if it raised doubts about the probability that the share would be repaid in full. Investors should thus regard zeros, like other forms of shares, as a long-term investment. One further caveat is needed. There are some split-capital trusts which have issued zero-coupon debentures; these do not have the same tax advantages as zero-coupon shares. For those who find the above factors too complicated, there is a unit trust which invests specifically in zeros. Exeter's Zero Preference Trust has a minimum holding of Pounds 750, an initial charge of 5 per cent and an annual charge of 0.8 per cent.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Zero-dividend preference shares  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                  Gross   Asset   Years/                        Share   Redemption   redemption   cover   months                        price        price        yield      at       to Company                  (p)          (p)       (% pa) wind-up  wind-up  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Abtrust Preferred Income                 143.0       218.00          8.2     1.2     5.4 City of Oxford          88.5       110.00          8.5     1.0     2.8 Contra-Cyclical         70.5       150.00          9.7     0.9     8.2 Drayton Blue Chip      142.5       217.00          8.5     0.9     5.2 EFM Income              53.0        95.10          8.4     0.9     7.4 Exmoor Dual            174.0       489.80         12.8     0.7     8.7 Finsbury Smaller Companies              168.5       279.00          7.6     2.2    6.11 Fleming Income &amp; Capital                 42.5        85.20          8.0     1.2     9.2 Fleming Int High Income                  87.0       117.60          8.5     1.1     3.9 Gartmore American Securities              84.0       100.00          8.4     1.3     2.2 Gartmore Scotland      150.0       292.40          8.2     1.0     8.6 Gartmore Value Invs     85.5       101.17          8.8     1.1     2.0 Henderson Eurotrust     33.5        70.00          7.9     1.7     9.9 Hong Kong               32.5        43.90          8.0     1.6    3.11 I&amp;S Optimum Income                 191.5       259.66          7.6     1.2     4.2 Jos Holdings           114.5       249.00          8.1     1.1    10.0 Jupiter European        45.0        85.30          8.4     1.2    7.11 Kleinwort High Income                 142.5       212.70          7.7     1.2     5.5 Murray Split Capital   145.5       216.00          7.3     1.5     5.7 Olim Convertible       180.5       327.14          9.9     0.9     6.4 River Plate &amp; General                 77.5       100.00          7.0     2.4     3.9 Scottish National      210.0       325.00          8.0     1.2     5.8 Sphere                  84.5       107.50          9.2     1.0     2.9 St David's             130.5       207.00          8.2     1.7    5.10 TR Technology          203.0       313.20          8.6     1.2     5.3  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Association of Investment Trust Companies January 29 1993  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

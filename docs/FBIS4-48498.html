			<p>BFN     [Text] Malawi's president-elect, Mr. Bakili Muluzi, has  said he will have no problems in forming a coalition government  with the Alliance for Democracy, Aford, if his party, the United  Democratic Front, UDF, failed to win a majority in number of  seats in Parliament. Addressing a press conference in Blantyre  today, Mr, Muluzi ruled out the possibility of forming an  alliance with the Malawi Congress Party [MCP] if his party  failed to (?form) a majority in Parliament. But Mr. Muluzi  disclosed that his government will look after the outgoing  president, Dr. Kamuzu Banda.    On his government's policy on the economy, Mr. Muluzi said  his priority will be to alleviate poverty. He said his  government will attempt to improve social services, reduce the  high infant mortality rate, and improve the education sector to  reduce the illiteracy rate (?in the country). Mr. Muluzi also  said that the UDF government would put emphasis on the  enforcement of the rule of law. Mr. Muluzi will be sworn in as  president on Saturday on May the 21st.    In his victory speech addressed to UDF supporters at the UDF  national headquarters, Mr. Muluzi said all Malawians are winners  because they have made it possible for this country to  experience political transition [words indistinct] the only way  of (?building) reconciliation and democracy is in Malawi to  stay.

At this point, Mr. Muluzi called on the  people to join hands [words indistinct] regardless of political  affiliation, race, [words indistinct] or color [passage omitted  including indistinct words]</p>

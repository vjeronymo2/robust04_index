			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cairo, March 29 (AFP)--PLO chief negotiator Nabil  Sha'th on Tuesday [29 March] accused elements within the Israeli  army of wanting to torpedo the Middle East peace process after  soldiers shot dead six Palestinians on the eve of a new round of  talks.    The shootings were "a premeditated crime carried out in cold  blood by killers within the Israeli army who want to kill the  peace process," Sha'th told AFP.    Israeli troops shot dead six members of the armed wing of  PLO  chief Yasir 'Arafat's Fatah group on Monday in a Gaza Strip  refugee camp. Another Palestinian died and 29 were wounded in  clashes with Israeli troops on Tuesday.    Palestinian witnesses denied Israeli army allegations that  the Fatah men were armed, and said they were shot in cold blood  as they handed out leaflets.    The shootings came as Israel and the PLO prepared to meet in  Cairo Tuesday amid hopes of clinching a security deal for  protecting Palestinians, opening the way for a resumption of  autonomy negotiations.    Sha'th said it was not a coincidence that last week "five  Palestinians were killed in Hebron (last week) on the eve of a  resumption of talks ... and that they (Israeli soldiers)  committed a crime in Gaza on the eve of Tuesday's talks."    Sha'th said he has also been in touch with the US officials  about the incident.    Army deputy chief of staff General Amnon Shahaq telephoned  Sha'th during the night to explain the shootings were "not  premeditated" and that such incidents were unavoidable, Israeli  state radio said.    Sha'th declined to say whether Tuesday's talks would now be  postponed following the latest shootings.    He said he had been in contact with PLO headquarters in  Tunis  where "intense meetings have been going on all night."    An Israeli foreign ministry spokesman said Israeli  negotiators were to fly to Cairo Tuesday despite fears that the  talks may not go ahead.    Five Palestinians were killed in a 20-hour Israeli army  operation last week in Hebron, when soldiers pounded a house  being used as a hideout for members of the Islamic Resistance  Movement HAMAS, hours before Israeli and PLO delegations met in  Cairo.</p>

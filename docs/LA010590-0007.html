			<p><P> January 5, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MORATORIUM ON BUILDING SMALL MOTELS EXTENDED  </P> <P> A moratorium on the construction of small motels has been extended by Inglewood  City Council members to allow planners to prepare tighter building codes for  the units.  </P> <P> The temporary measure, first approved Nov. 21, bans construction of motels with  fewer than 40 units through Nov. 20, 1990.  </P> <P> The measure had been scheduled to lapse last Friday but City Council members  voted unanimously to approve the extension.  </P> <P> Councilman Garland Hardeman, who oversees the district with the greatest number  of small motels, said he sought the ban as a means to discourage drug dealers  and prostitutes, who frequently use the facilities.  </P> <P> "This gives the city more time to take a look at some provisions . . . for a  permanent ordinance regulating small motels in the city," Hardeman said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 1, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> BENEFACTOR'S $275,000 LOAN FUNDED FLORES' TELEVISION ADS;  </P> <P> POLITICS: TRAILING BADLY IN THE RACE FOR SECRETARY OF STATE, JOAN MILKE FLORES  TURNED TO A WEALTHY SAN PEDRO FRIEND FOR FINANCIAL HELP. HER AGGRESSIVE AD  CAMPAIGN HAS NARROWED THE GAP.  </P> <P> Trailing badly in the polls and eager to begin her television advertising  campaign, Republican secretary of state candidate Joan Milke Flores faced a  major obstacle several weeks ago: She needed more money.  </P> <P> Fund raising was going well, but not well enough. Flores, in her first bid for  statewide office, had tens of thousands of dollars in advance advertising bills  to pay before stations would air her 30-second spots.  </P> <P> Flores needed a benefactor, and so she turned to her loyal base of support in  San Pedro, her home and one of several communities she has represented on the  Los Angeles City Council since 1981.  </P> <P> Ernest (Tom) Papadakis, a wealthy friend and longtime political supporter who  heads one of the community's most prominent families, loaned Flores $275,000 on  Oct. 1, according to her financial disclosure statement filed this week. An  aggressive Flores television campaign took to the airwaves the following day.  </P> <P> Although she still trails Democratic incumbent March Fong Eu in the polls as  Election Day approaches, Flores has narrowed the gap, in large part, her  campaign says, because of the television ads.  </P> <P> "I hate borrowing money," Flores said in an interview. "The only bill I really  have is for my house, and even that I try to pay extra payments. . . . But we  assessed the situation and decided we had to do television, and when it looked  like we were falling short of our (fund-raising) mark, I hated to do it, but we  felt we had to borrow the money."  </P> <P> Papadakis owns Anchor Liquors Corp., a chain of liquor stores based in San  Pedro, and serves as chairman of Flores' statewide campaign committee. His son,  John, owns the Papadakis Taverna in San Pedro, and another son, Nick, runs a  San Pedro real estate investment business.  </P> <P> Papadakis, 66, works in San Pedro but has lived in Rancho Palos Verdes since  1962. The family also owns various properties in San Pedro, and Angie  Papadakis, his wife of 44 years, has served on the state Board of Education and  is currently a member of the California-Nevada Super Speed Train Commission.  </P> <P> In a brief telephone interview, Tom Papadakis had little to say about his loan  to Flores, except that she was deserving of any assistance he could give her.  </P> <P> "In this day and age, when you find a politician of that caliber, I think you  should do something about it," said Papadakis, who, with his wife, has also  contributed $2,000 to the Flores campaign. "She is an outstanding person, and I  have a lot of faith in her."  </P> <P> Papadakis met Flores when she worked as an aide to her predecessor on the City  Council, John Gibson. When Flores ran for council in 1981, Papadakis served on  her first campaign committee and joined several other supporters in loaning her  $14,000 in the final weeks of a hard-fought contest. Flores says the loan was  crucial to her eventual victory.  </P> <P> Flores describes Papadakis as a friend, an adviser and a "political animal" who  prefers to operate outside the public eye. He has served on the board of the  San Pedro Peninsula Hospital and has been active in the San Pedro Boys Club,  but his wife is far more visible in the community. Angie Papadakis is a  professional speaker, owns her own public relations agency and is an  accomplished humorist.  </P> <P> "Tom has always been content being a little bit behind the scenes," Flores  said.  </P> <P> During the telephone interview, Tom Papadakis would not discuss the details of  his business or financial dealings, saying they were "a private matter" and had  nothing to do with his loan to Flores. Flores said Papadakis, a Democrat, has  never asked for any special favors in the past, and she said the loan would not  entitle him to any in the future.  </P> <P> "I don't feel any obligation except to pay the money back," Flores said. The  loan has a 12% interest rate and is due in one year.  </P> <P> With the loan, Flores can continue her television advertising through Election  Day, including a new hard-hitting spot that accuses Eu of waiving fines against  politically connected companies and special interest groups.  </P> <P> As of Oct. 21, Flores had spent $410,000 on her television campaign, whereas Eu  had spent $163,000.  </P> <P> The loan, however, has had a political price. In her harshest attack of the  race, Eu this week accused Flores of deliberately concealing the loan by filing  her financial disclosure statement several days late. In letters to the state  Department of Justice and to the Fair Political Practices Commission, Eu's  campaign demanded that criminal or civil charges be filed against Flores.  </P> <P> Eu has also criticized Flores for violating court-overturned restrictions in  Proposition 73, which limited contributions and barred large personal loans  such as the one from Papadakis. Eu has pledged to adhere to the restrictions,  even though a judge ruled in September that they are unconstitutional and no  longer applied to this election.  </P> <P> "Without the loan, Joan Flores might have had to run on even terms" with Eu,  said Leo McElroy, Eu's campaign consultant. "We feel (Proposition 73) is a  mandate from the voters, and somebody ought to honor that."  </P></p>

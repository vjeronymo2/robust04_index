			<p><P> December 8, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NINTENDO ACCUSED OF UNFAIR MARKETING  </P> <P> While visions of Super Mario Brothers dance through the heads of millions of  children this holiday season, the maker of the Nintendo home video system is  playing unfair games with consumers, the chairman of a congressional antitrust  panel charged Thursday.  </P> <P> Rep. Dennis Eckart (D-Ohio) urged the Justice Department's antitrust division  to investigate Nintendo of America, the U.S. subsidiary of the Japanese  electronics firm that revived the electronic games industry and now controls  80% of the $3.4-billion market.  </P> <P> Eckart's complaint, outlined in an 11-page letter, contends that Nintendo has  engaged in "unreasonable tactics to restrain competitors" by exercising rigid  control over production of the game cartridges played on Nintendo consoles sold  in America.  </P> <P> Eckart, whose House small business antitrust subcommittee has investigated the  video game industry, would like Nintendo to allow more companies to produce  software for its machines with fewer strings attached.  </P> <P> "The key is that software drives sales in this area," Eckart said in an  interview. "Nintendo's dominance of the home video game market and its tight  control of software production has led to an unprecedented level of control  over the marketing end of the industry."  </P> <P> Nintendo officials angrily denied Eckart's charges that unfair marketing  practices have created their near-monopoly and accused the congressman of not  giving them an opportunity to defend themselves.  </P> <P> "He is just grandstanding," said Howard C. Lincoln, senior vice president of  Nintendo of America, which is based in Redmond, Wash.  </P> <P> In raising the issue less than three weeks before Christmas, Eckart could  strike a chord with millions of parents across the country who are trudging to  toy stores to buy Nintendo games and software -- and often finding them in  short supply.  </P> <P> Nintendo game systems and software have been among the biggest draws for toy  retailers for two consecutive years, said Michael Karr, store manager at Toys R  Us in Santa Ana. Altogether, video games account for as much as 25% of all toy  sales.  </P> <P> "There's quite a bit of traffic in that area," Karr said. "The software is  doing quite well and is more than living up to sales projections."  </P> <P> Popular software -- such as Super Mario Brothers, Legend of Zelda and Teen-Age  Mutant Ninja Turtles -- sometimes is hard to find, he said.  </P> <P> Nintendo's game-playing units retail for $80 or more, and game cartridges range  in price from $30 to $60 each. Nintendo officials estimate that the company  will have its systems in 20% of all U.S. households by the end of the year.  </P> <P> Only games licensed or sold by Nintendo can be played on Nintendo consoles.  That practice ensures that independent software publishers cannot break into  the Nintendo market, inflating the cost of games to consumers by 20% to 30%,  Eckart said.  </P> <P> The Ohio congressman contended that Nintendo has created artificial shortages  of some games sold by licensed software producers and accused Nintendo of  intimidating retailers to keep competitors' games off toy store shelves.  </P> <P> Lincoln said that Nintendo's business agreements and practices have been  reviewed in depth and cleared by the company's attorneys.  </P> <P> "We are confident that (our business practices) fully comply with U.S. laws,"  he said. "They were designed to and have succeeded in restructuring a dead  industry in the U.S. -- to the benefit of numerous small and large businesses  from coast to coast, as well as retailers around the nation."  </P> <P> Nintendo requires the installation of a patented computer chip, or "lock-out  chip," in each game cartridge sold in the United States to ensure that only  licensed cartridges can be used in Nintendo consoles. Lincoln said the chip is  a security device aimed at preventing the sale and use of pirated, counterfeit  or poor-quality games.  </P> <P> Eckart disputed that claim. "If it were a question of quality control, they  would use a lock-out chip in Japan -- which they don't."  </P> <P> Eckart compared Nintendo's use of exclusive software arrangements and computer  chip barriers to control the market -- known as bundling -- to a practice  halted by International Business Machines in 1968 after a threat of Justice  Department intervention.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 4, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VIEWFINDER: ODDS &amp; ENDS FROM AROUND THE VALLEY;  </P> <P> IT'S MY PARTY AND I'LL STAR IF I WANT TO  </P> <P> The "Me Decade" may be synonymous with the 1970s, but "me" is emerging as the  latest popular theme for private parties, especially birthday bashes.  </P> <P> "We still get calls for the same old themes (Mexican, back to the '50s,  black-and-white), but I think people are really trying to personalize their  parties. We've been doing parties recently where the whole theme was about the  birthday person," said Carolyn Baer, co-owner of Cheers Catering in Northridge.  </P> <P> The invitations, for example, may feature photos of the celebrant or take the  form of a Trivial Pursuit card with questions about the person's life.  </P> <P> "Even the props we create to decorate the party are all about the person," Baer  continued, "such as using life-size photos of the person at different ages. "Or  maybe we'll put giant versions of the Trivial Pursuit cards all over the  place."  </P> <P> Some birthday boys and girls ask that headlines from the date of their birth be  used on invitations or decorations. Hit songs from that era -- as well as from  the person's teen-age years -- may comprise the entertainment.  </P> <P> Most important: Don't forget to take out the camcorder so there's something to  show at next year's birthday bash.  </P> <P> Pink and Blue -- and Black  </P> <P> Black is no longer the exclusive fashion province of comedians, working women  and wanna-be punk rockers. Babies and young girls are donning dark duds, too.  </P> <P> "There are people who are prejudiced against black as a color for babies, but  most people who are trendy seem to like it -- as long as the style isn't  gloomy. The outfit must have some fun to it," said Abbey Faranesh, owner of  Animal Kracker/Treehouse in Encino.  </P> <P> "The older generation doesn't like black on babies," said Marcie Perrie, a  salesperson at Splash in Studio City, which even carries black outfits in the  3-month size. "Sometimes a person isn't sure if the mother of the baby they're  buying for will like black. Or they're not sure if it's OK for a girl baby.  They tend to buy more black for boy babies, but it's a good unisex color."  </P> <P> Girls in the 7-to-14 size range are deciding that black is a sophisticated  color. "When we opened 14 years ago, you never thought of putting black on a  child," said Alissa Cohen, owner of A La Popcorn in Woodland Hills. "Now black  is our strongest color, especially with this summer's neon colors as accents."  </P> <P> And what has replaced black as the consumer untouchable?  </P> <P> Brown.  </P> <P> Buying Dad's Car  </P> <P> Consider the 1956 Ford Fairlane.  </P> <P> Perhaps it brings back memories of sticky Sunday afternoon drives or counting  out-of-state license plates during a trip to grandma's. But if your dad held  onto the car, it might bring visions of riches to your family.  </P> <P> Thirty-three years ago, that Fairlane cost $2,459. Today the car -- in average  condition -- would bring $15,000 to $20,000; the same auto in mint condition  could bring $50,000.  </P> <P> "The market for the big-engine cars of the '50s and '60s is crazier than it's  ever been," said Holden Raphael, president of Spectrum Vehicle Auction in  Northridge.  </P> <P> Many men in their mid-30s are buying the cars from their childhood. "Or they're  buying the car they craved as a teen-ager, because now they can finally afford  it," said Raphael, whose company holds classic car auctions throughout  California.  </P> <P> Nostalgia, of course, is frequently expensive.  </P> <P> A Chevy Camaro that cost $2,809 in 1967 could go for $30,000 -- if it's in  flawless condition.  </P> <P> Who knows what price a 1989 Ford Geo will command in 2015.  </P> <P> Native Solutions  </P> <P> Does your yard have a spot that resembles the Bermuda Triangle? A patch where  every plant gets the life sucked out of it?  </P> <P> You may as well throw your money directly into the ground, thus sparing  yourself a trip to the nursery and the futile effort of planting, right?  </P> <P> Maybe not.  </P> <P> The Theodore Payne Foundation, a nonprofit nursery in Sun Valley that  specializes in California native plants, may have a remedy for your black  thumb. "One of the misconceptions people have about native plants is that  they're hard to grow," notes Melanie Baer, manager and horticulturist. "But I  bet about 98% of these plants take."  </P> <P> What's more, many of the California native plants are drought-tolerant. "People  think of these plants as dry and scrubby," Baer said. "But a lot of them are  green and lush looking. People who come here are surprised by their beauty."  </P> <P> Many of the plants are now in bloom. Among the roughly 650 varieties for sale  by the foundation are California lilacs, manzanitas, wild iris, wild geraniums,  wild hibiscus and wild delphiniums, plus more than 100 plants that are on the  rare and endangered list.  </P> <P> "Our business has doubled every year for at least the last five years," Baer  said. "We teach anybody who wants to learn what we know about California native  plants."  </P> <P> Just think -- if you spruce up the yard, your neighbors might forgive the pink  flamingos.  </P> <P> Overheard at . . .  </P> <P>  "One of the best things about having a baby is that you get to drive in the  car-pool lane to get onto the freeway."  </P> <P>  -- Father speaking to another father in the checkout line at Toys R Us in Van  Nuys.  </P> <P> for foto slugged FINDER PARTY  </P></p>

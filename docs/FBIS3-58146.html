			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Italian Foreign Minister Beniamino Andreatta: </F> "NATO, We Italians, and the Rest"]    [Text] Newspaper and magazine editors have recently been  criticizing Italian foreign policy. In particular, it is being  stressed that the supposed "internationalist" inspiration of  Italian policy -- in Somalia, in Mozambique, in support of the  sanctions in Yugoslavia, in backing Yeltsin's reform policy, in  the development of a common foreign policy at the European  level, and in the GATT negotiations -- neglects "national  interests."    According to these interpretations, Italy's busy activity  within the international bodies is a way of evading decisions on  points of position and emphasis -- for instance, between a  "Mediterranean," rather than "European," role.    These criticisms are based on an anachronistic vision of  foreign policy, are groundless, and, if supported, would prove  counterproductive.    Italy does not have to choose between a Mediterranean and a  European policy because there is no inconsistency between them.  Indeed, we are important actors in the Mediterranean precisely  because we are a European power and, vice versa, we are heeded  in Europe partly by virtue of our special sensitivity to the  problems of the South of the Old Continent.    Whenever in the past our foreign policy was unbalanced, the  consequences were serious. Whenever we tried to become the  foremost Mediterranean power we became, by the same token, the  last of the European powers. Whenever we adopted aggressive and  unilateral policies in the Mediterranean and Africa -- as with  Crispi and Mussolini after 1934 -- we were left so isolated in  Europe as to be forced into alliances that were contrary to our  own interests.    Italy is a country that is now a full and fully qualified  part of the West, so there is no reason to adopt any eccentric  or unnatural forms of behavior. Furthermore, even though,  because of our geographical position, we are exposed  particularly to the instabilities caused by the end of the Cold  War, we certainly do not have the resources -- economic,  military, or in terms of public support -- to tackle these  problems on our own or in a unilateral manner.    Rather, our main objectives are to strengthen collective  instruments such as NATO, the European Union, the CSCE, and the  United Nations. They have the legitimacy and the capability to  prevent crises from degenerating and to enhance our credibility  and assert our viewpoint more strongly. This means taking part  reliably in these organizations' operations and development,  rather than allowing ourselves to become marginalized by  supposed selfish interests. In any case, the very development  of military technologies has made peace indivisible.    Moreover, the very concept that Italian foreign policy is  allegedly neglecting the national interest is without substance.  It is surprising that this argument is being used by circles  that are very critical of the Catholic vision of the common  good. Indeed, there is no one nation personified in a single  and consistent interest, as perhaps there was in the courts of  dictatorial regimes, in which context, indeed the very concept,  of the national interest was formulated.    In the modern world, however, the states and the complex  societies that make them up have many varied, sometimes partial  and conflicting interests. Some of the analysts with whom I  have met to discuss the former Yugoslavia readily cite national  interest and accuse the Foreign Ministry of aligning too much  with European positions.    Beyond this, they sometimes seem divided between a  pro-Serbian and a pro-Croatian conception of the national  interest. Apart from ignoring the principle aspects of the  matter, which are what specifically prompted us to support the  Bosnians, these analyses therefore conceal personal sympathies  and allegiances beneath the cloak and the powerful rhetoric of  the national interest.    Perhaps it would be wiser to talk about general interests --  that is, interests that are the outcome of a great number of  particular interests of individuals, regions, or economic groups  that are themselves mutually conflicting -- without lapsing into  the naivete of the existence of uniform national interests or  the hypocrisy of portraying particular interests or opinions as  the interests of all. Yet, again, our conscience forces us to  mistrust these ideological pseudoconcepts. The skill of  politics lies precisely in bringing together and moderating  these differing interests.    This does not mean that Italy does not have a clearly  defined path ahead of it. The "recent internationalist swing"  has already set our country on this path. Indeed, we must help  create the international conditions for our country's  development, the very conditions that have for the past 40 years  guaranteed the modernization of civil society and the growth of  prosperity.    This progress is bound to a liberal and universal vision of  international trade, keeping in mind that one-half Italy's  exports go to countries outside Europe and 90 percent of those  are outside the Mediterranean. Hence the change of approach  that I introduced in the GATT negotiations, in the final months  of which we were determinedly in favor of concluding the Uruguay  Round and opposed to any parochial defense of supposed  inalienable European interests.    This progress can also be achieved by strengthening our  country's attachment to the architectures of the community of  nations -- the only structures that can mobilize sufficient  resources to guarantee a secure international environment and a  transition to prosperity and peace for the areas of crisis. Not  only will this permit us to avoid the costs that insecurity  entails, but it will create new markets for our products.  Indeed, the rationale of geoeconomics, albeit competitive, is  different from the conflictual rationale of geopolitcs, because  the "cake" to be shared out is growing all the time. Quite the  opposite, therefore, of the unilateralist implications of those  who cite "national interests."</p>

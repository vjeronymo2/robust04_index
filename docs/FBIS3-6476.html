Commenting on this, MINJU CHOSON today declares it reveals  Japan's intention to promote arms buildup and overseas  aggrandizement more openly.    The news analyst says:    No country in the world now can match Japan in the growth  rate of military spendings and the scope of armed forces  reinforcement.    Japan's move to become a military power and arm itself with  nuclear weapons fully reveals the Japanese reactionaries' wild  design to build up enough strength to enter into the scrambles  for world supremacy.    They intend to extend the operational scope of the  "self-defence forces" worldwide and realise their dominationist  ambition with strength, crying for Japan's "international role  commensurate with its power."    In order to legitimate their dangerous nuclear armament and  overseas aggrandizement, they are making a fuss about the  "nuclear issue" of the DPRK.    If the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula is resolved  fundamentally and it becomes a nuclear-free zone, the Japanese  reactionaries will lose the pretext for turning Japan into a  military power and promoting its nuclear armament and will be  unable to stage a comeback to the Korean peninsula, a part of  their old dream of "the greater East Asia co-prosperity sphere".  This is why they are creating obstacles to the settlement of  the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, hurling mud at the  DPRK, and are aggravating military confrontation and tension in  this part of the world.    They must know that their reckless act will only precipitate  their self-destruction.</p>

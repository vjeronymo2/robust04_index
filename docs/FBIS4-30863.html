			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Olga Prascakova, chairwoman of the Slovak </F> Green Party Preparatory Committee, by Eva Zelenayova; place and  date not given: "The Greens Lean Toward National Forces"]    [Text] [Zelenayova] The Green Party in Slovakia yesterday  formed a coalition with left-oriented parties. We know that  this coalition was a reason for a large part of members to leave  the Green Party. Could this not be avoided?    [Prascakova] No. We consider the Party of the Democratic  Left [SDL] to be the heir of the Communist Party of Slovakia,  which bears maximum responsibility for the devastation of the  country and morals. Also, it is inadmissible, for reasons of  principle, for Greens to enter into a coalition with any  political party.    [Zelenayova] Does that mean that you are preparing the  registration of a new Green party? Is that desirable?    [Prascakova] We have already applied for registration. It  is common throughout the world for two Green parties to exist  alongside each other. Usually, they are divided into  fundamentalists and realists.    [Zelenayova] Do you think that you will gain enough members?    [Prascakova] Entire district organizations and groups are  declaring their allegiance to us. Only 14 out of 29 districts  attended the last meeting of the Coalition Committee where the  vote on entering a coalition with the SDL was to be taken.  Apparently, the remaining 15 district organizations were  opposed to this coalition.    [Zelenayova] Will your new Slovak Green Party go into the  elections on its own?    [Prascakova] Originally, we did not want to join forces with  anyone. But as the party's polarization has already been  provoked, we will lean toward the nationally oriented parties  and movements.    [Zelenayova] But [SDL Chairman] Peter Weiss has called the  left-wing coalition a patriotic one.    [Prascakova] We are not convinced about that. It is through  the SDL's fault that the political situation is now under the  control of parties of the Hungarian ethnic minority. Some  officials of the Green Party in Slovakia, too, are favorably  disposed toward the demands formulated in the Komarno appeal  [issued by representatives of the Hungarian minority on 8  January 1994].    [Zelenayova] Are you not afraid that Greens will stop taking  an interest in Green policies?    [Prascakova] Not at all. We are actually creating an  alternative for voters who subscribe to the Green philosophy but  do not want to vote for the left-wing bloc and [an alternative]  for that part of our members who want to work for the  environment but are leaving the party because of its coalition  with the SDL. We will strive to enlist new members, whereby we  will increase the number of people who take an interest in the  Green philosophy.</p>

			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / Davidians cult survivors arrested after fire Three Branch Davidian cult survivors of the fire which destroyed their compound in Waco, Texas, are led away under arrest yesterday. US president Bill Clinton said he did not intend to ask attorney general Janet Reno to resign over the disastrous ending to the 51-day siege. He said he accepted full responsibility for the events which culminated in the deaths of about 80 members of the religious cult when the FBI advanced on their stronghold. Report, Page 6</p>

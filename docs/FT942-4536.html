			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / Leading Article: Questions for the bankers The collection of central bankers present in London to celebrate the tercentenary of the Bank of England have never enjoyed greater independent authority over monetary policy. But power brings vexatious responsibility and important questions remain to be solved. Abandonment of the gold standard was largely explained by a belief that monetary policy should help secure full employment. Unfortunately, the Bretton Woods monetary system proved inadequate to curb the consequent impulse towards over-expansionary monetary policy. Where the system failed, experience succeeded. Events in the 1970s justified the fundamental notion of the monetarist counter-revolution, which was that a monetary expansion would, in the long run, lead only to higher inflation. Enter, then, the modern independent central bank, with its clear mandate to secure price stability. That had been the mission of the Bundesbank, whose establishment reflected both the anti-Keynesian views of German policymakers and the country's catastrophic monetary experience. Its example has been increasingly imitated throughout the world. With the UK government's explicit inflation target, the inflation report, the publication of minutes of the meetings between the chancellor of the exchequer and the governor of the Bank of England and the latter's increasingly outspoken comments, even the Old Lady is on a looser chain. Extraordinary freedom In the absence of exchange rate or monetary targets, central banks have extraordinary freedom in deciding how to achieve their objectives and even to define the precise criteria by which they are to be judged. Even where banks are not formally independent, as in the UK, the disappearance of exchange controls gives them great leverage over government. Their power to publish is also power to destroy government credibility. The case for such enhanced central bank autonomy is overwhelming. People make financial decisions that are much longer term than is any parliament. To do so safely and efficiently, they must have confidence in the monetary framework. Even though this case for independence is widely conceded, the debate over central banking is far from over. At least four big questions remain. The first is how best to combine independence with accountability. The New Zealand example, with its precise 0-2 per cent target for inflation, looks attractive. It forces the central bank to be more explicit about its views, thereby increasing confidence in markets. Target zones The second is how to link currencies. At present, major currencies are in a lightly managed float against one another. It is easy to accept that it might be better in an ideal world for there to be a world currency, as under the gold standard. That is politically infeasible. Yet it is uncertain whether a more managed float, such as one involving 'target zones', would be an improvement. The third is how to manage increasingly complex and interlinked global financial markets. The problem of derivatives is on everyone's lips. There is also growing concern at the persistent tendency of the markets to bubble and collapse, transmitting the ill-effects worldwide. Finally, there is the issue of banking supervision. Again the innovator, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, has decided to hand this job over to the markets, by insisting that all information be made public. The advantages of such a shift or, alternatively, of separating central banking from supervision seem evident. Only thus would it be difficult for depositors, seeking compensation, to argue that central bankers are to blame for bank failures. Answering these questions will not be easy. Internationally, central bankers will have to manage an ever higher degree of co-operation, given the increasing integration of financial markets. Domestically, they will be blamed when things go wrong and will be tempted to hide themselves behind a veil of secrecy. But they can achieve what they want only if they say what they are doing and why. Theirs is a game of credibility and confidence. It must, correspondingly, be played with consistency and clarity.</p>

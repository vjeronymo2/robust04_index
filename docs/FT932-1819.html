			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / UK Company News: NIE shares rise 26% amid heavy trading SHARES IN Northern Ireland Electricity rose more than 26 per cent yesterday amid heavy trading, on their first day on the market following privatisation. The price of the partly paid shares touched 130p at one stage, against the flotation price of 100p, before ending the day at 126 1/2 p. Analysts said yesterday NIE was likely to stay at about yesterday's closing level in the next few days. At yesterday's close, the shares were trading at a yield on 1992-93 earnings of 5.2 per cent, about the average for regional electricity companies in England and Wales. SG Warburg Securities was advising clients to sell when the price rose above 125p. Mr Nicholas Pink, an analyst, said it was difficult to see how NIE could outperform the market above that price. However, some institutions were looking to buy shares in the company because they had been unable to pick up the weighting they sought during privatisation. The shares were subscribed 2.7 times. During the day 51m of the 164.6m shares changed hands, making NIE the heaviest traded stock on the market for the day. Interim certificates are due to be despatched on Thursday.</p>

			<p>940723 FT  23 JUL 94 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: A cut-throat competition I am still trying to dream up a new world game. I have been at work on it for a fortnight, ever since Miss Lee, my executive assistant, declared that soccer was hideous - 'just groups of hairy men rolling on the ground' - and that virtually all sports, especially those with balls, were fundamentally silly. She had read that the man who founded Nike - she couldn't remember his name, but was sure he had a beard - had set himself the target of inventing a new game. The more I pondered, the firmer grew my belief that Miss Lee and this man were on to a good thing. Almost all the games we play are unbelievably silly. Golf, for example, is one of the stupidest activities devised. You manufacture a ridiculously small ball and dig an extremely small hole - in fact 18 tiny holes, separated by thousands of yards of bull-dozered landscape - and then you build a club-house and sit back and watch as fat, smug people wearing lilac sweaters and enjoying the complacency of prosperous middle age waddle up and down your golf course, attempting to thwack this ball over a pile of displaced peasantry and a pyre of slaughtered wildlife, into this tiny hole. They even keep score, and then repair to the clubhouse where they fill their throats with gin and talk about their incomes and how they're changing the Jag and isn't Bambi pitiful but it won't mean a thing by the time of the general election because people aren't stupid and will still vote for Major who is starting to improve his act. Study the sports pages of our weightiest organs and you will see that almost every type of game that could be invented has been invented. The Daily Telegraph this week even devoted space to the lacrosse World Cup, which is taking place in England and has attracted, thrillingly, a team of Iroquois who are said to stand, together with four other teams, 'between England and glory'. Miss Lee is right; we need a fresh approach. One that attracts me is that old sci-fi game, Assassin], in which a trained killer arrives in some megalopolis and hunts down a human quarry. The event is televised all day. Tension mounts unbearably. As the hunt progresses, you do rather wonder if the person the killer is seeking could be your head of department or even, conceivably, you. The denouement is covered on the 6pm news. If the quarry escapes, he (or she) is awarded Pounds 5m. If not, he (or she) dies, right there in prime-time, garrotted, shall we say, or vaporised by laser-gun. The victim could be quite ordinary, or someone extremely prominent, such as the micro-brained individual who permits Queen Elizabeth II to stage garden parties at Buckingham Palace in the middle of the working week. This summer, my progress home from work in my six-year-old Rover has been brought to a halt time and time again by the tumult and scrummaging occasioned in the Mall and along Constitution Hill by hordes of the socially mobile leaving Buck House at the end of one of these parties. It happened again on Tuesday. Traffic in central London ground to a complete stop - there was already a heatwave raging - as a motley crowd of party-goers swept from Buckingham Palace and milled about outside. I turned off my engine and surveyed these appalling people. A lot of them seemed to be from parts of Britain that we hoped we had heard the last of - places where ships or cars or other large metal objects used to be manufactured but which are now reverting to primeval forest, thanks to the ministrations of the Tories, or have been razed and then manicured into back-to-back golf courses. As well as people from the regions, the swell of party-goers in the Mall on Tuesday included numerous serving officers from our great armed forces - nuclear submarine captains, cavalry and artillery officers, leaders of pike-units from the Tower of London and a lieutenant in charge of a detachment of sad-faced men shouldering arquebuses. I think Assassin] would be a good game. But I am sure it can be improved on. By next week I hope to have thought of a better one. If I fail, I will stage a competition to see whether readers can suggest a new world game that would satisfy Miss Lee and the man who founded Nike. A prize will be offered - something really glamorous. Tune in next week.</p>

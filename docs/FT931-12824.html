			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / UK Company News: US recovery boosts Domino A STRONG recovery in the US helped Domino Printing Sciences, the Cambridgeshire-based European market leader in continuous ink-jet printing, to push profits before tax up 32 per cent in a slowing market. Interest income totalling Pounds 1.81m also helped boost pre-tax profits to Pounds 11.94m against Pounds 9.03m last year. Mr Howard Whitesmith, the managing director, said that if the interest stream - derived from cash accumulated through a rights issue in 1991 - were stripped out together with a first year operating loss of Pounds 492,000 on the company's new PackTrack operations, the growth of the core business was broadly equivalent to that of the previous year. Sales grew 19 per cent, from Pounds 60.37m to Pounds 71.61m, while operating profits increased by 12 per cent from Pounds 9.07m to Pounds 10.13m. Earnings per share were up 8.4 per cent at 30.02p (27.69p) and a final dividend of 4.8p makes a total of 7.2p, a 15 per cent advance on the 6.25p paid for 1991. The share price closed at 506p, up 35p. Domino is one of a small group of principally UK-based companies which have benefited from worldwide legislation obliging manufacturers to stamp sell-by dates or lot numbers on foods, pharmaceuticals and beverages. Mr Gerald Dennis, Domino chairman, said he was pleased by progress in the US. 'Strengthened management and an expanded sales force have enabled us to increase our market share in a sluggish economy. In Europe, following a strong previous year, growth has moderated, reflecting the more serious economic circumstances.' The company has diversified from commercial ink-jet printers into the PackTrack mimeographic printing technology, and 17 of these printers were installed in the first year of operation. So far, Mr Dennis said, no acquisition opportunities had presented themselves. COMMENT Domino continues to dominate the UK and European market for commercial ink-jet printers although its young rival Linx is taking some sales. In Europe, the French competition Imaje is seeking a financially sound partner and is, at present, a reduced threat. Domino's recovery in the US where sales have risen from Pounds 12.5m last year to Pounds 17.6m is particularly encouraging and suggests the company could take further market share from its principal competitor Videojet. Analysts are suggesting Pounds 13.25m before tax giving 33p of earnings and a prospective p/e of 15.3. It looks a sound bet.</p>

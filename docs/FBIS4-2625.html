			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Roundup": "No Concrete Result From Pak-U.S. Nuclear Talks"] </F>   [Text] Islamabad, April 10 (XINHUA) -- The talks between a  senior U.S. official and Pakistani leaders on the nuclear issue  and F-16 aircraft Saturday [9 April] produced no concrete  results with both sides sticking to their respective positions.    However, the two sides termed the dialogue as "productive"  and agreed to continue the talks at various levels through  "quiet diplomacy."    Speaking at a press conference here Saturday, U.S. Deputy  Secretary of State Strobe Talbott said he had a "more  productive" dialogue on important issues including nuclear  non-proliferation with Pakistani leadership.    "This dialogue will continue as we search for ways to make  more substantial and bilateral progress to advance our goals in  the region as a whole, " he said.    Talbott, who flew into Islamabad from New Delhi on Friday as  part of the U.S.' effort to "rid South Asia of nuclear weapons,"  brought two proposals regarding the verifiable capping of  Pakistan's nuclear program in exchange for F-16s and the  convention of a multilateral conference on nuclear  non-proliferation and regional security in South Asia.    He spent a busy day Saturday, meeting President Farooq  Leghari, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, Foreign Minister Sardar  Asif Ahmad Ali, officials of Foreign Office as well as some  opposition leaders.    "Pakistan reiterated its position of not accepting  unilateral  capping of its nuclear program and called for an equitable and  balanced approach towards non-proliferation in South Asia," said  a Foreign Office spokesman Saturday while briefing newsmen about  the wide-ranging talks with Talbott.    "Unilateral capping of nuclear program is not acceptable and  that remains our position," he reaffirmed.    Pakistan has been insisting that it would not unilaterally  open its nuclear facilities for inspection unless the same is  done by India, a neighboring country with which it had fought  three wars since 1947.    Talbott, on his part, stressed at the press conference that  F-16s is a part and parcel of the U.S. initiative to secure a  verifiable cap of Pakistan's nuclear program.    "The status of F-16s and our proposal about capping of  Pakistan's nuclear program are obviously tied up together and  they will be considered together," he claimed.    Washington suspended all its military and economic aid to  Pakistan in October 1990 under Pressler Amendment on suspicion  that Pakistan has developed a nuclear device which Pakistan  denied.    Pakistan's nuclear program also triggered U.S. refusal to  deliver those F-16s which Pakistan had already paid for.    Meanwhile, in a statement issued Saturday, Nawaz Sharif, the  country's main opposition leader, also rejected any inspection  and verification of Pakistan's nuclear program, saying these  will be tantamount to a rollback.</p>

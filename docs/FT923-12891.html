			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / Concern at likely level of police pay THE pay of Britain's 120,000-strong police force in 1992-93 is set to rise by 7 per cent, or just under, according to the Public Finance Foundation, David Goodhart writes. This is well above most public-sector increases and the foundation, an independent pay research group, says it gives a further push to the creation of a 'two-tier' public sector, The monthly index of average earnings for May, published today, determines police pay from September 1992 to August 1993. A pay rise of about 7 per cent would take a constable at the top of the scale to more than Pounds 21,000. Last September pay rose by 8.5 per cent. The police have had a pay determination system based on average earnings since the late 1970s, but that system is under review. The government is keen to inject an element of performance pay. It also wants to be able to award good police officers who do not want to climb the career ladder. The review's findings are not likely to be agreed in time to alter the current system in 1993-94. Police pay has had a higher percentage rise than the public-sector average in almost every year since 1976. Staff at Granada Television fear a new round of redundancies is being planned including the hiving-off or closing of some of the ITV contractor's activities, Raymond Snoddy writes. Meetings between Mr Andrew Quinn, chief executive of Granada Television, and Granada's unions are expected later this month. Granada Television, one of the main programme producers for the ITV network, has been under increasing pressure to cut costs since the arrival last year of Mr Gerry Robinson as chief executive of the Granada Group. Earlier this month Granada announced a 49 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 57.2m for the 28 weeks to April 11. In February pressure on costs led to the forced resignation of Mr David Plowright, chairman of Granada Television. Some staff fear that there are plans to turn Granada into a publisher/broadcaster, commissioning an increasing proportion of programmes from outside. This is denied by the management. Granada's television production centre in Manchester is seen by senior management as a cost burden rather than an asset.</p>

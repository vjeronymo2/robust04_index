			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Gardening (Plant of the Week): Galanthus Atkinsii This is a snowdrop and, if I were confined to one variety only, this is the one I would choose because it spread rapidly into fine colonies and it has very fine flowers on long stems. Curiously, it produces no seeds and its rapid increase is due to bulb multiplication, which means that it shows no variation at all, but is always of the same uniform quality. It flowers in February and early March, prefers semi-shaded places, but will grow in full sun and is best planted immediately after flowering, when it can be lifted with soil around its roots, divided into small clusters of bulbs and replanted as soon as possible.</p>

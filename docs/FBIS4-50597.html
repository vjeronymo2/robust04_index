			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 19 (XINHUA) -- Various preparations  for construction of the Shenfu-Huanghua project, involving a  total investment of over 40 billion yuan (about 4.6 billion U.S.  dollars) are drawing to an end and full-scale construction of  the project will soon start.    The project includes further development of the  Shenfu-Dongsheng coalfield in northwest China's Shaanxi  Province, which will have a total production capacity of more  than 100 million tons a year; construction of the  Shenfu-Huanghua railway with a total length of 820 km; and  construction of the Huanghua port on the Bohai Sea in north  China, which will have an annual handling capacity of 100  million tons of coal.    The project is aimed at transporting the fine-quality coal  from the Shenfu-Dongsheng coalfield to the eastern part of the  country.    The Shenfu-Dongsheng coalfield already has a yearly  production capacity of 10 million tons. The second-stage  development of coal mines with a total annual capacity of 30  million tons has been listed as one of the 151 national major  projects for 1994.    The Shenmu-Shuoxian section of the Shenfu-Huanghua railway  has already gone into operation. The design of the electrified  multiple-track Shuoxian-Huanghua railway has been completed  thanks to the efforts of over 300 designers over the past  several months. Now, a 1,000-member survey team is making the  final survey along the railway line to pave the way for the  start of the construction.    Work on overall design of the Huanghua port is now in full  swing. Meanwhile, preparations for construction of the  supplementary projects of the port such as power and water  supply projects and telecommunications and communications  networks will soon be completed.</p>

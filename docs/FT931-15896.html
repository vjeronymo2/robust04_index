			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Arts: In search of a White Knight - Dulwich is brave to break loose ANYONE with a paltry Pounds 200,000 a year to spare has a once in a lifetime opportunity to adopt the nation's first, and perhaps most cherished, art gallery. Dulwich Picture Gallery wants to sort out its future for once and for all. It is sick of launching periodic appeals for funds to cover the fact that it receives no significant public money. It rattles on with a revenue of around Pounds 360,000 a year and costs that are over Pounds 460,000. It thinks that a gallery with its history and contents deserves better. The story of its collection is romantic. The late 18th century dealer Noel Desenfans was commissioned to acquire a choice group of Old Masters which would form the basis of the national museum of Poland. It was a wonderful time to buy, with the fall out from the French Revolution flooding Europe with cheap pictures. But then the Great Powers gobbled up Poland and Desenfans was stuck with the stock. It contained paintings by Murillo, Canaletto, Van Dyck, Poussin, Tiepolo and more, and should have formed the basis of a British national gallery. Instead it ended up at Dulwich College, as did Desenfans, who is buried in a mausoleum in the art gallery designed by John Soane. The Estate Governors of the College are the villains in the piece. They give the gallery Pounds 150,000 a year but their reserves total Pounds 42m and a worryingly high proportion of their annual income disappears in management costs. The Gallery has decided to break loose, recruit its own Trustees and make a play for the market. Even so, it expects the Governors to keep funding this undoubted local asset. Its director, Giles Waterfield, is disarmingly open minded as to where the Pounds 200,000 needed to make up the deficit and to ensure gallery improvements should come from. At the moment the Gallery is spending its capital, which will run out in two years. Then Waterfield will close the doors. He will not go for the easy fix and sell a major painting. The last time the Trustees did this, 20 years ago, they imagined that the Pounds 100,000 raised from the Domenichino they sold would secure the future. The money lasted four years and brought Dulwich a poor reputation. So where will the White Knight come from? The neatest and nicest solution would be for Dulwich, with its collection of choice Old Masters, to become a satellite of the National Gallery, which already helps out on its picture restoration. But Neil MacGregor of the National Gallery has no desire to follow the lead of Nick Serota at the Tate and preside over a plethora of out-stations. The next favoured approach would be for the National Heritage Fund to come up with a Pounds 3m endowment which would enable Dulwich to remain independent. But the Fund is the victim of Government cutbacks, and there is little chance of this happening before the arrival of Lottery money and the Millennium Fund. There is more mileage in anticipating a generous gesture from the Secretary for National Heritage, Mr Peter Brooke, whose officials have held mildly encouraging talks with Waterfield. But if the search is on for a final solution, what about something really imaginative and making Dulwich the UK outpost of the Getty Museum at Malibu California. With its annual income in excess of Dollars 100m the Getty could well afford to adopt Dulwich. So could a rich family like the Sainsbury's, which has local links, or a company like British Telecom or British Gas. The money needed is paltry. If anything Dulwich is in danger of selling itself short: an imaginative gallery like the Tate is currently looking for nearer Pounds 100m for its development. In the short term the biggest drawback, the relative inaccessability of the Gallery, is made good by the display at Christie's (until January 24). Not all the treasures are on show, the much stolen Rembrandt has not made the journey, but wonderful works by Canaletto, Poussin, Murillo and Gainsborough take on a grander look on the high walls of Christie's. Many are returning to their mid-wife since Christie's was the major supplier to Desenfans, who paid 11 guineas for the Murillo flower girl in 1785. Given such a price it is easy to see why Dulwich has found it hard to move with the times.</p>

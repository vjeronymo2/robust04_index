Colonel Rudi  Supriatna, commander of 012 Military Area Command, said Thai  trawlers flying Indonesian flags, who operate in the western  Aceh waters, often violate this clause.    The commander, who was aboard the Indonesian Navy's Nomad  plane along with Navy Commodore Widodo, commander of the Western  Fleet's Naval Combat Group, made an inspection tour of western  Aceh waters today. During the inspection tour, they found three  foreign fishing boats in (Calang) waters, western Aceh, at about  156 km west of Banda Aceh and they were operating within 12  miles from the coast. Another violation committed by the  trawlers was the use of drift nets, which are capable of  catching all types of fish.</p>

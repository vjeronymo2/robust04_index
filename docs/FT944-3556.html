			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / Trusts 'to control 98% of the NHS' Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, said in the Commons last night that 98 per cent of the National Health Service would be under the control of self-governing trusts from April next year. Labour MPs strongly disputed her claim that the growth in the number of trusts, coupled with other changes introduced in 1991, had produced a 'fundamental and irreversible shift' in the balance of power to patients. Mrs Bottomley moved the second reading of the bill to abolish regional health boards and merge district and family health service authorities. She said it would put in place 'the final building block to create the first-class health service' needed for the next century. Mrs Margaret Beckett, shadow health secretary, said the self-governing trusts represented a 'structure of individual health businesses' which would not be acceptable to the next Labour government. She said that the changes initiated by the trusts had resulted in care being determined by management and not by medical need. The conflict between managers and clinicians was growing, she said. Mrs Beckett saw the bill as further confirmation that the government's 'ultimate agenda' was the privatisation of the NHS. Mrs Bottomley said she had approved a further 13 applications from hospitals and ambulance services which wished to become trusts from next April. Trusts were already responsible for 96 per cent of hospitals and community health services, she said, and from next April this would increase to 98 per cent. Mrs Bottomley saw the streamlining of NHS administration by the bill leading to an annual saving of Pounds 150m in England and at least Pounds 3m a year in Wales. A further Pounds 50m would be saved by reductions in the Department of Health. The bill was given a second reading after a Labour amendment complaining that it failed to deal with the problems of hospital closures, waiting lists and commercialisation of trusts was defeated by a government majority of 41 (308-267).</p>

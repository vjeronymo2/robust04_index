			<p><P> August 18, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OIL ISSUES  </P> <P> Of all the industrial nations affected by this conflict, Japan, which imports  virtually all of its oil, has the most to lose. Could it be possible that the  United States is now fighting a war that was initiated by the greed of Kuwait  and Japan? I believe that with Japan having the most to lose economically from  this conflict that country should be one of the first to offer economic and  military aid to achieve rapid resolution. To date, Japan has been conspicuously  quiet.  </P> <P> RHETT RECHENMACHER  </P> <P> Sunland  </P></p>

			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / International Company News: UK building society to securitise mortgages Bristol &amp; West Building Society, the UK's 10th largest, is set to launch a commercial mortgage securitisation, the first by a UK society. It intends to issue about Pounds 150m of listed bonds, equivalent to approximately 17 per cent of its commercial mortgage book, to help fund its commercial property lending business. Bristol &amp; West and Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank involved in setting up the deal, were unable to comment yesterday on the details and terms of the issue, which are expected to be announced next month. However, Goldman Sachs said the issue was likely to be of floating-rate notes, involving senior and sub-ordinated tranches. The move was welcomed by industry analysts. 'This particular transaction is an excellent prelude to the development of the securitisation market in the UK for building societies,' said Mr Rick Abbott, director responsible for securitisation at Morgan Grenfell. Securitisation is common in the US but is still at an early stage of development in the UK. It allows financial institutions to take loans off their balance sheets, removing the risk of default and freeing capital. Bristol &amp; West will place the commercial mortgages in a special-purpose vehicle which will sell the debt securities to investors. Interest on the 'mortgage-backed' securities will be funded by the loan repayments. Earlier this year, the Building Societies Commission issued draft guidance on securitisation, and in May, the Leeds Permanent Building Society raised Pounds 100m through a type of securitisation, based on residential mortgages. However, instead of selling securities in the public market, the Leeds used a pool of mortgages as collateral for a loan from a group of banks. Other lenders, such as The Mortgage Corporation, have made extensive use of securitisation to fund their residential mortgage books, although activity has died down in recent years due to the weakness of the housing market. Bristol &amp; West said yesterday it had no plans to securitise residential mortgages.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Zdenek Zuntych: "The Active Launching of the </F> JETE First Unit Was Postponed Until September 1996"]    [Text] Temelin--According to the current time schedule,  the fuel charge at the first unit of the Temelin nuclear power  plant (JETE) should take place in September 1996. It is a new  date, published for the first time, of the active launching of  the largest Czech nuclear power plant. After the decision was  made about the final stage of completing two JETE units, the  fuel charge was considered for the end of 1995.    According to JETE press spokesman Josef Vita, the new date  stems, above all, from the substantial, very time-consuming  changes that are now being implemented at the construction on  the recommendation of the International Atomic Energy Agency and  expert analyses and the subsequent audit by the U.S. firm NUS  Haliburton. Examples of this are the system of automatic  control of the technological processes, the change of the  nuclear fuel and related safety analyses, the new  radiation-monitoring system, the completely new diagnostic  systems, etc.    The first 1,000-MW unit is now 96-percent completed  regarding  the actual construction, and 55-percent from the technical  angle. The second 1,000-MW unit, which is expected to be put  into operation approximately 18 months after the first, is now  80-percent completed regarding the construction, and 30-percent  technically. The total cost of the construction remains at the  level of 68.8 billion korunas.    After all of these changes, the power plant is supposed to  fully satisfy all West European operational and safety  standards. At the same time, the JETE management would welcome  it if the parliament finally adopted the so-called atomic law  and related legislation.    "It is better for us if we know under what conditions we  operate than if we are to respond post factum to new legislative  decisions," Vita says. The changes at JETE are supposed to be  settled legislatively this year in accordance with the  construction law, and all of the subcontractor transactional  relations are to be settled as well. The $317-million credit  approved by the U.S. EXIMBANK has not yet been used. Nothing  will be done before the signing of the credit contract that is  to specify the conditions for drawing the funds, including the  terms for repayment. "It is in our interest that it be done as  soon as possible," Vita concluded.</p>

"I  fully respect the people's will, but it has somehow legitimized  the absolutely coup-like use of TV made by our opponent."  Around 2300 hours [2100 GMT], [Greens coordinator] Carlo Ripa  di Meana -- his eyes tearful, "but only because of the TV  floodlights," -- arrived in the Greens National Federation  headquarters, in via Catania, where he was met by a small group  of activists.    The first figures broadcast by TV were taken in with dismay  and amazement, particularly as they placed the Greens below the  fatal 4 percent threshold. "It cannot be, I cannot believe it,"  remarked a young girl when Meana read out the first exit-poll  figures. Then silence set in, interrupted only, now and then,  by a bitter comment against [National Alliance leader  Gianfranco] Fini or [Democratic Christian Center member  Ferdinando] Casini, who was branded as a hypocrite. Someone in  a corner was expressing his concern at what might happen now to  the health system, or to the laws on abortion and divorce.    As they waited for the spokesperson, they nibbled some food,  but nobody was very talkative. Senator Carla Rocchi arrived,  and remarked: "To be frank, I did not expect us to reach the  threshold. I now hope the proportional system, which triggered  off the coalition rat-race, will be completely dismantled."  Rocchi was also asking herself where [Pact for Italy member]  Alberto Michelini's thousands of votes may have gone: "I am  amazed by the fact that someone who mustered so much support is  now left high and dry. I really wonder why."    Then Ripa di Meana turned up. The TV cameras cornered him  against a wall, but he answered the questions calmly, saying he  first wanted to look at the real figures. However, he was  already being told that two mistakes lay behind the  progressives' defeat: having staked everything on continuity  with Ciampi's government and having scrapped the  environmentalists' proposal to regroup the minor parties so as  to avoid being cornered in the elections. It sounded like an  attack on [PDS Secretary Achille] Occhetto, on Democratic  Alliance [AD], and on Rete. However, Ripa di Meana did not wish  to be polemic. He thanked his allies and said he would discuss  these problems with them. In the meantime, he relaunched the  environmentalist campaign, a Europe-wide struggle which knows no  borders. However, the Greens spokesperson pointed his finger at  the use that radio and the media made by [Forza Italia leader  Silvio] Berlusconi and the latter's allies. [Radical leader  Marco] Pannella and "Radio Radicale" also came under attack.  Rocchi said wryly: "It will be very ironical if Pannella makes  it into parliament thanks to the proportional law which he  systematically opposed."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Hangzhou, May 22 (XINHUA) -- The daily improved  investment conditions in Zhejiang Province, east China, are  attracting an increasing number of foreign investors.    The province actually used foreign investment totalling 220  million U.S. dollars in the first quarter of this year, an  increase of about 70 percent over the same period last year.    Last year saw the province approve the establishment of  4,400  foreign-funded enterprises, involving a contractual investment  of 3.7 billion U.S. dollars. Actual use of the investment  amounted to 1.2 billion U.S. dollars.    A provincial official said that the growth was mainly  fuelled  by the better service of local government departments; the  increase of direct foreign investment and construction of large  infrastructure projects.    Once a project is approved, the government will follow its  construction closely and is always ready to offer a helping  hand, he added.    Of the contractual investment last year, about 300 million  U.S. dollars came directly from enterprises solely funded by  foreign investors.    More and more overseas investors have shown interest in  energy development and transport projects in the province, the  official noted.</p>

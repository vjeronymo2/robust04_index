			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Agnes Bokor based on data of the Szonda-Ipsos </F> polling agency: "Which Small Party Can Get 200,000 Votes? Six  Small Parties in the Shadow of Six Big Ones"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] We can put the parties in the  following five groups on the basis of the party list election  results that can be expected at this time: [passage omitted]    1. Those parties that can rightfully count on at least 10  percent of the vote, that is, those that will certainly be  parliamentary parties in the next cycle. These are presently  FIDESZ [Federation of Young Democrats], the MDF [Hungarian  Democratic Forum], the MSZP [Hungarian Socialist Party], and the  SZDSZ [Alliance of Free Democrats]. (The MDF, in whose case it  is not possible to exclude even a 4- to 10-percent vote result,  is a borderline case.)    2. The other two parliamentary parties, the FKgP  [Independent  Smallholders Party] and the KDNP [Christian Democratic People's  Party] can only hope to get less than 10 percent of the vote,  but it is very probable that they will get above the 5-percent  threshold. (The FKgP is a borderline case because in an unusual  situation, it might get squeezed out of parliament.)    3. It is possible that not a single party aside from the six  above will meet the requirements for getting in. On the basis  of Szonda-Ipsos's 1993 data, however, we can say that the  Agrarian Federation, the Republic Party, the Workers Party, the  Social Democratic Party, the Entrepreneurs Party, and the Green  Alternative can have some hope of success as they try to expand  their voter base to the necessary degree. (The Green Alternative  is on the borderline between groups three and four, mainly  because, as we will see, those who sympathize with it show  little intention of taking part [in the election].)    4. There are parties, including the United Smallholders  Party, the Hungarian Interest Party, the MIEP [Hungarian Justice  and Life Party], the Hungarian Market Party, and the NDSZ  [National Democratic Federation], whose existence public opinion  is aware of but whose support is so low according to the  research data (fewer than 1 percent of the potential voters)  that only in the most extraordinary situation would they be able  to get 5 percent of the vote. (Of these parties, MIEP is the one  whose sympathizers, it can be assumed, are most likely to remain  hidden in the course of public opinion research; therefore,  perhaps this party can also be considered a member of the  previous group.)    5. Finally, there are parties whose existence is in effect  not recognized by the voting public, although they are  registered parties and even have some members at their disposal.  People do not mention them in any form, not even occasionally,  in the course of public opinion research. [passage omitted]</p>

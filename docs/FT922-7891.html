			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / 'Green' rules alarm companies NORTHERN companies in sectors under pressure from environmentalists are concerned that their prospects are being threatened by the cost of compliance with over-hasty legislation. A survey published yesterday highlights strong discontent among manufacturers with the Department of Trade and Industry. It was based on interviews between December last year and February this year with chairmen, chief executives and managing directors from 62 of the largest private-sector employers in north-east England and Cumbria. Many felt that DTI ministers lacked understanding of the support that manufacturers needed. Business leaders in sectors such as energy and food also felt the government had failed to define its policy or shape European Community legislation to the advantage of UK companies. Companies in sectors under environmental pressure, such as plastics and chemicals, food and drink, pharmaceuticals and energy, also voiced great frustration at the complexity of UK and EC environmental regulation. The survey, A Business Agenda for the North, was prepared by Price Waterhouse, the accountancy firm, and the economic research office of the Northern Development Company. It says there is strong satisfaction with the region's further and higher education institutions.</p>

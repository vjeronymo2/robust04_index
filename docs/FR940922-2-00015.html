			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> DOC Position <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> We agree with petitioners in part. The Department normally uses actual depreciation expenses, exclusive of any gains or losses. Therefore, we have made adjustments to the reported depreciation amount in the final results to reflect the total depreciation this grower experienced.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With regard to petitioners' second argument, we disagree that the full value of the partnership's depreciation expense should be dedicated to the current grower because it is not clear from the record that the current grower was the sole owner of the assets in question in the partnership. Therefore, we have not made adjustments to the partnership's depreciation expense in the final results.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 19 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Petitioners argue that the fact that the ownership of the kiwifruit property changed during the POR and that the original property was split complicated the calculation so much that the reported labor does not provide supportable grounds for deriving this grower's labor expenses. Petitioners contend that the Department should compute this grower's labor cost based on the methodology suggested by petitioners in Comment 14.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> DOC Position <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> We disagree. Respondent's methodology of allocating costs based on land area is an acceptable methodology in this case. Without a more accurate alternative, we accepted respondent's labor cost allocation as an appropriate estimation of the cost of cultivating kiwifruit. Accordingly, we have accepted respondent's methodology for the final results.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 20 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Petitioners argue that as a result of respondent's deduction of picking and packing expenses from the COM, the calculation of this grower's total cost of goods sold is erroneous. Furthermore, petitioners contend that the costs added by respondent for the value of animal stock sold, shearing wages, management, farm working expenses, repairs and maintenance, depreciation, rates (property taxes) and vehicle expense are in error because the value of animal stock sold as described in the grower's submission does not represent actual costs of producing the goat, deer and sheep stock sold. According to petitioners, respondent's inclusion of these values resulted in grossly overstated total costs. Petitioners assert that, if these values are included, the ``value'' of the kiwifruit plantation should also be included.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Respondent argues that neither the value of the livestock retained, and not sold, nor the value of the orchard are included in the cost of sales it provided to the Department. Thus, respondent asserts that petitioners' argument that the value of the unsold orchard should be included in the allocation is without merit. Furthermore, respondent contends that petitioners' argument is factually unsound because U.S. GAAP governing the valuation of livestock held for sale specifies that the value of the livestock is the acquisition price, if any, plus the cost of feed and other costs of maintaining the livestock until sold. According to respondent, for tax reporting purposes in New Zealand, the principle is the same: the cost of sales is the cost of developing (i.e., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  raising) the livestock. Respondent further contends that each year the New Zealand Inland Revenue, the tax authority in New Zealand, publishes a schedule which specifies the expected cost of developing livestock. Respondent maintains that this schedule is specific with respect to breed, sex, and maturity, and that it is this value that respondent used in its response. Respondent argues that the Department normally accepts the accounting principles of the respondent's home country, and that in the case of this grower the accounting principle is the same as that used in the United States. Therefore, respondent argues that the Department should use the cost as reported by respondent in the allocation of G&amp;A as it was based on New Zealand GAAP and reasonably reflects actual cost.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> DOC Position <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> With regard to the issue of picking and packing expenses in the COM, we disagree with petitioners. ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  our position in response to Comment 16.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We disagree with petitioners' second comment that the value of animal stock sold by this grower does not represent the actual cost of producing the goat, deer, and sheep. The Department normally accepts the accounting principles of the respondent's home country, and in the case of this grower the accounting principle is not distortive. Therefore, we have accepted respondent's methodology in the allocation of G&amp;A for this grower.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Comment 21 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Respondent contends that only productive hectares and not non-producing hectares should be assigned orchard set-up costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> DOC Position <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Since we have accepted respondent's methodology of allocating orchard set-up costs for the reasons explained above ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> DOC position under Comment 6), respondent's comment in this instance is inconsequential.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Comment 22 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Respondent contends that pasture land must bear an appropriate share of management, repairs and vehicles expenses because it is an integral part of the orchard's operations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> DOC Position <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We agree that pasture land should bear a share of management, repairs and vehicles expenses. Accordingly, we have made adjustments for this grower's management, repairs and vehicle expenses in the final results.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / Observer: Buggins' turn They used to say that behind every Polish minister there stood a Soviet adviser. It now seems the Soviet official has been replaced by a pin-striped London merchant banker. SG Warburg has just been been given the plum job of advising the Poles on mass privatisation. The UK government has promised to reimburse the costs through its 'know-how' fund, a gigantic system of outdoor relief for the City. So the Poles could hardly have chosen a non-British bank such as Morgan Stanley. But why Warburg? Since no-one has ever before contemplated returning 8,000 or so companies to the private sector, there is nothing in Warburg's record to suggest it is any better equipped than any of the other obvious contenders which also have Polish speakers on the staff. It sounds like yet another example of Buggins' turn. But if the powers that be are not careful, the UK government will be accused of having a favourite merchant bank.</p>

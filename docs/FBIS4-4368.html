			<p>CSO     [Text] Kota Kinabalu, 13 Feb--The ruling party, the Sabah  United Party (PBS), has never been serious in its efforts to  develop and advance the state.    Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Sri Anwar Ibrahim said the  matter  is evident from the attitude of the PBS, which has never made  any request of the Federal Government regarding development and  progress for the benefit and comfort of the people of Sabah.    "In the more than four years since the PBS left the National  Front (BN), the PBS has never made any clear or serious request  for the purpose of developing the State of Sabah," he told  reporters today at Papar Mosque, about 50 kilometers from the  state capital, when interviewed at a meeting with the public to  break the fast.    Also present at the meeting were Osu Sukam, BN candidate  from  the Kawang District, and Rahim Ismail, BN candidate from the  Buang Sayang District, who are, respectively, president and  deputy president of the UMNO [United Malays National  Organization] Papar Division.    Anwar, who is also minister of finance, said that from the  time the PBS stabbed the BN in the back until now, the Central  Government has never received any letter from the party for the  purpose of obtaining allocations for development for the benefit  of the people of Sabah.    "All that the Central Government received from the PBS was a  request for privatization projects, including the privatization  of Sabah Forest Industries (SFI), which would benefit merely a  few PBS leaders," he said.    On the same subject, Anwar advised the people of Sabah to be  cautious of PBS political propaganda as the election approaches.  He said the people of Sabah must not let the PBS buy their  dignity during the "election fever" season before the eighth  Sabah State Legislature election, now only about four days away.  According to Anwar, the PBS will soon use its money  "distribution" tactic among the people of Sabah.    "I will not be surprised if the PBS soon distributes two or  three hundred ringgit to every Sabahan. But what is the value  of that amount of money over five years? Where are our national  values and what is the value of our dignity if our eyes are  closed by two or three hundred ringgit distributed every five  years?" he asked.    Anwar called on the people of Sabah to eliminate the PBS in  this election in order to move in a more meaningful direction in  the future. He said the people of Sabah who are Muslims have no  choice other than to bring down the PBS, which does not respect  Sabahans who follow Islam.</p>

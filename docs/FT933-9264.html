			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Williams buys Aqualisa via Pounds 23.5m deal Williams Holdings is expanding its shower manufacturing side through the acquisition of Aqualisa Products for Pounds 23.5m. The business will complement Williams' Heatrae Sadia offshoot, which markets showers under the Gainsborough and Heatrae Sadia brands. Net assets of Aqualisa are expected to be Pounds 3.2m at completion and the consideration is subject to a net asset adjustment dependent upon completion accounts. The price will be met by the issue of 2.8m shares - unchanged yesterday at 336p - and cash. For the year ended September 30 1992 Aqualisa made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 1.8m on turnover of Pounds 13.2m. Despite the present poor trading environment in the UK it is expected to improve this year. Aqualisa was founded in 1976 to market a valve which enabled consumers to experience a more powerful shower.</p>

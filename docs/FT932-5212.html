			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Airtours seen in bid move STRONG rumours that Airtours, the UK's third biggest tour operator, is considering buying travel group Hogg Robinson sent shares in both companies sharply forward yesterday. Leisure analysts said they believed negotiations for an agreed offer had reached an advanced stage, although they declined to put a potential purchase price on such a deal. Airtours has made no secret of its desire to make an aquisition in the travel agency market to consolidate last year's purchase of Pickford's. The move would also be a consolation for Airtours' failure earlier this year to capture Owners Abroad, the UK's second largest tour operator; this market assault left Airtours, the predator, with an estimated Pounds 50m war chest. Leisure specialists said that Hogg Robinson, which has over 200 retail outlets, would be a good fit with Pickfords. Airtours paid Pounds 16m for Pickford's 333 branches. A spokesman for Airtours said: 'We never comment on market rumours.' Airtours shares gained 6 1/2 to 301p, while Hogg Robinson added 4 to 190p.</p>

			<p>940418 FT  18 APR 94 / Moves to curb lookalike own-brands opposed Retailers and consumer groups are joining forces this week to fight proposals from manufacturers that would stop shops selling 'lookalike' own-brands. The government's trademarks bill, designed to bring UK law on unfair competition into line with European Union rules, is due for its second reading today. The British Producers and Brand Owners Group - which includes Allied-Lyons, Grand Metropolitan, Mars, Nestle, Procter &amp; Gamble and Unilever - wants to see the bill amended to include protection against copycat competition from retailers. Brand owners want the bill amended so that there would be protection against lookalikes which do not directly copy logos or designs but imitate the overall appearance of branded goods. The Consumers' Association and the National Consumer Council will tell MPs on Wednesday that shoppers will pay higher prices and get less choice if own-brands are restricted. A survey by Which?, the Consumers' Association's magazine, concluded earlier this year that consumers could save more than 25 per cent on a weekly shopping bill if they bought own-label equivalents of branded products. An example of the own-brand attack comes this week from J. Sainsbury as it launches a cola designed to compete in flavour with Coca-Cola, the brand leader, and undercut its price. The British Retail Consortium said survey results disclosed today show that consumers are not confused by own-brand equivalents of leading products. The research, conducted by MORI for the consortium, found that 78 per cent of shoppers said they never confused branded goods and the lookalike versions. More than half of the sample of 514 shoppers said they liked branded and own-label goods to look similar because it provided them with 'visual clues' about the products. The retailers argue that, in any case, manufacturers often copy one another and there are recognised conventions in packaging and colours which help 'signpost' products for shoppers. Examples include blue and red packs for milk and dark chocolate, blue packaging for household bleach and yellow bottles for lemon-scented washing-up liquid. Meanwhile, brand owners say that even if consumers do not confuse branded and own-label products, similarities in appearance can give the impression that manufacturers have made both. In reality, most brand manufacturers no longer also make own-label goods for retailers.</p>

			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / Recovery in Germany gathers pace West Germany's economic recovery gained momentum in the second quarter, growing at a real, adjusted annual rate of more than 2 per cent, thanks mainly to heavy stock-building and rising exports, according to data from the federal statistics office. A surge of almost 9 per cent in the east pushed real, unadjusted pan-German growth for the first half to 2.8 per cent, and presented a pleasing overall picture, Mr Gunther Merk, office president, said yesterday. The data showed recovery in the west and continued strong growth in the east without any indications of overheating, he said in remarks later echoed by Mr Gunter Rexrodt, economics minister. Mr Otmar Issing, a Bundesbank director, also showed a relaxed attitude to price developments, saying that borrowing was under control and that the rise to 3 per cent in western inflation last month was due to high coffee and petrol prices which pushed the index up 0.2 per cent. The decline in inflation had been slowed but not stopped, he said in an interview with the financial newspaper Borsen Zeitung. Falling unit labour costs also made an important contribution to price stability, he said. The recovery would improve companies' cash flow rather than generate heavier demand for credit, Mr Issing added. His remarks appeared aimed at reinforcing other comments from the Bundesbank which have suggested there is still some scope for further reducing short-term interest rates. According to the statistics office, the western economy, which accounts for more than 90 per cent of pan-German GDP, grew a fully-adjusted 1 per cent between the first and second quarters after a 0.5 per cent quarter-on-quarter improvement in the first three months. Analysts calculated that stockbuilding accounted for around half a percentage point of the quarter's annualised growth rate of 2.3 per cent, but disagreed on whether heavy stocks on hand might signal a slowdown in the second half. They were also sceptical of 'political' remarks on overheating, saying it was too early for inflationary pressures to start showing through. Yesterday's data suggested the first quarter's heavy demand for new homes and relatively strong consumer spending had faded in the three months to the end of July. Although Mr Rexrodt claimed western consumer demand rose 1.5 per cent in the first half, the seasonally adjusted figures showed a real fall of 1 per cent in the second quarter following a rise of only 0.3 per cent in the first three months. Capital investment continued to fall in the review period, although at a far slower rate. However, as industrial capacity utilisation rises (it is already estimated to have risen to the long-term average of 83 per cent) spending on plant is likely to turn up, probably early in the new year. According to yesterday's data, pan-German labour productivity rose 4.1 per cent in the first half and unemployment was 15 per cent higher than in the comparable part of 1993. Wage and salary earners' gross income rose 2.3 per cent and overall disposable incomes increased 3.4 per cent. The statistics office also published upward revisions of western GDP data for the past two years. The economy grew 1.8 per cent in 1992, not 1.6 per cent as previously stated. It shrank 1.7 per cent in last year's recession, earlier calculated to have caused a 1.9 per cent contraction. Lex, Page 18</p>

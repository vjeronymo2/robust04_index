			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / Council to contract out finance functions OXFORDSHIRE has become the first English county council to contract out a large part of the work of its finance department in what will be seen as a landmark for the government's competitive tendering policy. CSL Group, which claims to be the largest provider of managed services to the public sector, won the Pounds 6m contract against three competitors. The contract requires it to take on the 50 existing staff, on comparable conditions, and was approved by almost all the employees concerned. With local authority compulsory competitive tendering moving from blue-collar to white-collar services, the market for such contracts is expanding rapidly. Other counties are set to follow Oxfordshire's lead. The contract represents more than a third of the value of the county's finance function. Under competitive tendering, the government will require councils to put at least 25 per cent of the sector out to tender, with the proportion rising to 90 per cent for construction-related services. The Oxfordshire contract, covering payroll processing, pensions administration and revenue collection among other functions, comes into effect in April. Oxfordshire anticipates savings of some Pounds 750,000 over the five-year contract period. Mr Chris Gray, county treasurer, said: 'Local government reorganisation, education reform and devolution of county services will mean that central services generally and financial services in particular will find it increasingly difficult to operate cost effectively.' He added: 'This seemed a sensible step to us. The staff were keen not to be fragmented, and we have been careful to ensure that they are kept together and based in Oxford.' Mr Mike Croften, a managing director of CSL, said: 'Local authorities are becoming enablers; they will increasingly be looking to companies like us to manage services for them.' A number of district councils have already contracted out some of the work of their finance departments. East Cambridgeshire led the way, contracting to Capita, the managed services group. South Oxfordshire has gone further than any, contracting out its annual budget-making function.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Defense Minister Muhsin Dallul has denied that  there are differences within the government, indicating that  there are only various views, something that is natural and  always results in a consensus. He said rumors on this are  attempts to sow discord and undermine the government. He said  he expected a Lebanese-Syrian summit soon.    Answering questions from Editors Association Doyen Milhim  Karam, Minister Dallul explained that the investigation into the  bombing of the Sayyidat al-Najat Church is being handled by the  judiciary and is continuing. An indictment is expected soon.  [passage omitted]    Regarding the issue of Gen. Michel 'Awn, Dallul said French  officials have expressed their disappointment with his violation  of the agreement that was sponsored by France. He added that  the Lebanese Government has not demanded his extradition because  Lebanon's problems are much more important than Michel 'Awn.  Dallul said the amnesty law contains certain conditions to  which Gen. 'Awn must adhere. If 'Awn continues to violate these  conditions, the amnesty law will no longer apply to him.

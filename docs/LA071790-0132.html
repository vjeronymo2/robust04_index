			<p><P> July 17, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY? WE'RE TALKING GOP TERRITORY;  </P> <P> POLITICS: THE NIXON LIBRARY IS ANOTHER BADGE ON THE CHEST OF THIS BASTION OF  CONSERVATISM AND WILL BE WORN PROUDLY.  </P> <P> Orange County isn't known for its cuisine or its architecture or even a crop,  like Iowa's corn. No, to the rest of the nation, Orange County is famous for  its politics.  </P> <P> This is the place where a Republican politician is treated like the returning  war hero in a John Wayne movie and a Democrat, almost like the faceless enemy.  But then, there aren't many elected Democrats and none ranked higher than  small-town mayor.  </P> <P> So when Richard M. Nixon decided to build his presidential library in Yorba  Linda, it was received by an enthusiastic and almost blushing audience. The  nation's most controversial living President faced protests at other possible  locations, but in Orange County the host was genuinely honored.  </P> <P> It is another badge on the conservative Orange County chest, and it will be  worn with all the gusto of a distinguished champion. If Nixon is a hero  anywhere, it is here.  </P> <P> "This is an occasion that absolutely brings tears of joy to my eyes because  Richard Nixon is finally being given the credit and acknowledgement that he  deserves," said Orange County Republican Chairman Thomas A. Fuentes, who  greeted Nixon in 1974 when he arrived from Washington at the El Toro Marine  Corps Air Station one day after his resignation.  </P> <P> "The library will forever be a special presence of him in the community that  loves him and always has loved him and wishes him well," he said.  </P> <P> Perhaps the most vivid demonstration of Orange County's unflinching support for  Nixon came in a scene from his darkest hour. When Nixon resigned, some parts of  the nation celebrated and in some parts, there was relief. But in Orange  County, an emotional and sympathetic crowd of nearly 5,000 people crowded the  El Toro base when Air Force One touched down with Nixon and his family on Aug.  9, 1974 -- their first day as private citizens.  </P> <P> Many waited two hours on that hot summer afternoon, and when Nixon and his  wife, Pat, stepped from the aircraft onto the red-carpeted stairway, they  chanted: "We want Nixon! We want Nixon!"  </P> <P> Some cried. Others waved American flags. And some carried posters with the  slogan from his 1972 reelection campaign: "President Nixon, Now More Than  Ever."  </P> <P> Nixon recalled the scene in his latest book, "In the Arena," as an emotionally  difficult one for him. During the brief stop, he hesitated before stepping to a  microphone where he told the cheering Orange County crowd: "We are home again."  </P> <P> As the helicopter rotors cranked up for the short ride to San Clemente, the  crowd began singing -- softly at first -- "God Bless America."  </P> <P> The Times reported the following day: "It was the first time Mr. Nixon had  faced the public since his Watergate crisis had worsened in the last few weeks.  He picked a friendly place, Orange County, where he lives and was born, an area  that faithfully falls into the Republican column on Election Day."  </P> <P> Orange County is a place where people seem to like their lives and want them to  stay that way. In a poll by The Times last year, an astonishing 96% of the  people said they were happy and one-third went so far as to say "Living in  Orange County is the closest thing to paradise in America today."  </P> <P> Translated into politics, it is a community that resists change.  </P> <P> Orange County Republicanism is anti-communist, free enterprise and small  government. It is heavily influenced by the libertarian philosophy integral to  its history. And it is home to some of the nation's most conservative  politicians -- namely U.S. Reps. Robert K. Dornan and William E. Dannemeyer.  </P> <P> In Washington, both have controversial reputations, but they both have enjoyed  solid support in their districts. It's one of Orange County's many  nowhere-but-here political stories.  </P> <P> In the 1988 elections, conservative hero Oliver L. North, who was later  convicted of crimes involving the Iran-Contra scandal, campaigned for two  Orange County congressional candidates, both of whom won in crowded fields of  Republican opponents.  </P> <P> And Nixon himself, who has hardly made any campaign appearances since leaving  Washington, traveled to Orange County for a $1,000-per-plate fund-raiser on  behalf of Bruce Herschensohn's 1986 Senate bid.  </P> <P> This comfortable Republican turf is also where a high-flying Ronald Reagan  kicked off his 1984 reelection campaign. And on the final day of California's  closely fought 1986 Senate race, Republican candidate Ed Zschau made his last  stand at an outdoor Orange County rally headlined by Reagan.  </P> <P> Consider some other evidence of the county's GOP muscle:  </P> <P> Basically, GOP candidates look to Orange County for their victory margins in  statewide races. Orange County is the Republican counterweight to Democratic  San Francisco. There is a general rule of thumb among political strategists  that a Republican candidate who wins in Orange County by more than 270,000  votes will be virtually unbeatable statewide and a GOP candidate who loses  Orange County cannot win in California.  </P> <P> "Orange County has become the Republican fulcrum in California," said Ken  Khachigian, a nationally known GOP speech writer and consultant from San  Clemente. "As a Republican strategist, I automatically view what margin I want  to take out of Orange County as my potential victory margin statewide. It's the  base, it's where we start."  </P> <P> Republicans have a virtual monopoly on elected power in Orange County. They  essentially represent all of the county's state and federal districts. All five  county supervisors are Republican. And of the county's 150 city council  members, 117 are Republican. There are also 29 mayors in Orange County and only  three are Democrats.  </P> <P> As demonstrated in this year's June primary, the county is also an exporter of  its political influence. Of the 12 Republican candidates running for statewide  office in the primary, half lived in Orange County or represented it while in  office.  </P> <P> Not only is Orange County rich in Republican votes, it is also rich in dollars.  The county Republican committee is the largest and wealthiest in the state,  with a paid staff of about 18 who conduct a year-round fund-raising and voter  registration effort. The committee spent more than $600,000 during the 1988  election and its most prestigious affiliate -- the Lincoln Club -- added  another $300,000.  </P> <P> Lamenting the lopsided politics, a delegate to the county Democratic Party  Central Committee said at a recent meeting: "In Los Angeles, I knew what it was  like to be discriminated against as a woman and a Hispanic. Now I know what it  is like to be discriminated against as a Democrat."  </P> <P> On the other hand, there are nearly 400,000 registered Democrats in Orange  County, the party's second-largest pocket of voters in the state. So it does  draw attention from statewide candidates such as the party's gubernatorial  nominee, Dianne Feinstein.  </P> <P> But there are more than 600,000 registered Republicans. The GOP has an edge in  registered voters of about 55% to 35% -- its strongest ratio in California.  </P> <P> Hugh Hewitt, executive director of the Nixon library foundation, says it is a  "happy accident" that the library ended up on friendly Republican soil. It  wasn't a requirement, he said, but it was a welcome factor.  </P> <P> OTHER VIEWS: Some unhappy campers out there in Nixon land. A20  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 5, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> E. GERMANS TOLD NOT TO USE U.S. EMBASSIES FOR REFUGE  </P> <P> The United States today sent a signal to East Germans seeking to emigrate to  the West not to use American embassies as a place of refuge.  </P> <P> State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said U.S. embassies are not equipped  to handle a large number of people hoping to leave their country.  </P> <P> "Our embassies and other diplomatic missions overseas generally do not have the  capability to handle even a limited number of people . . . especially people  who have to seek to depart their home country by sitting in at a foreign  embassy," Boucher said.  </P> <P> Eighteen East Germans who sought refuge in the U.S. Embassy in Berlin earlier  this week left after the government promised to review their cases positively  and not to take reprisals against them.  </P> <P> Boucher warned people thinking of copying them that there is no guarantee of  receiving similar assurances from the East German government in the future.  </P> <P> "We would also note that people put themselves in a potentially difficult  situation with respect to their own government," he said.  </P> <P> He noted that most fleeing East Germans want to go to West Germany, not the  United States, but said Washington remains ready to raise the cases of  individuals wishing to emigrate and other issues of humanitarian concern.  </P> <P> Earlier, President Bush said he was moved by the exodus of East Germans and  hailed West Germany's handling of the situation.  </P> <P> "America stands with the forces of change," Bush said during a Rose Garden  ceremony honoring German-Americans.  </P> <P> "We are riveted, and I am moved, by the tens of thousands of East Germans  sacrificing all that they own . . . to find their way to the West," Bush said  in his first public comments on the mass exodus.  </P> <P> "I want to praise the actions of (West Germany) in rising to the challenge  presented by these events," Bush told a small gathering that included 12  members of West Germany's Bundestag, or Parliament.  </P> <P> "I look forward to the day when Germans will not have to climb fences, freeze  in embassy courtyards or dodge bullets in order to enjoy the fruits of a free  society," Bush said.  </P></p>

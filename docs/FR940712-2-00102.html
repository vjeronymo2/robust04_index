(``Phlx'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared by the Phlx. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Phlx, pursuant to Rule 19b&hyph;4 of the Act, proposes to amend pending new Rule 1069 <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  to provide for the ability to: (1) Trade European-term option contracts on any foreign currency on which the Phlx currently trades foreign currency options (``FCOs''); (2) trade cross-rate FCOs on any two such approved currencies; and (3) allow users to quote all customized FCOs in percentage terms. Proposed Rule 1069, as well as existing Rules 1000, 1009, 1014, 1033, and 1034, would be amended accordingly. The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary, the Phlx, and at the Commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33959 (April 25, 1994), 59 FR 22698 (May 2, 1994) (``File No. SR&hyph;Phlx&hyph;94&hyph;11''). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In its filing with the Commission, the Phlx included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The Phlx has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On March 4, 1994, the Phlx filed with the Commission a proposal (File No. SR&hyph;Phlx&hyph;94&hyph;11) <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  to allow FCO traders and their customers to have the ability, within specified limits, to designate their own option exercise price parameters on a trade. In that filing, the Exchange proposed to allow its users to dictate the specific strike price of an FCO contract that they would like to buy or sell without requiring the Exchange to continuously disseminate quotes for these options. For example, if the Exchange has listed June .5450 and .5500 Deutsche mark calls and the customer wants to trade June .5487 Deutsche mark calls, the customer could request a quote in this option and the trade could occur. The Exchange, however, would not have to continuously disseminate quotes for this option until expiration because this may be the only trade that ever occurs in this series. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Id. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The Exchange is now proposing to expand upon its proposed FCO customization contained in File No. SR&hyph;Phlx&hyph;94&hyph;11. If File No. SR&hyph;Phlx&hyph;94&hyph;11 as well as the present proposal are approved, the Exchange would be able to offer the ability for its participants to trade non-standardized strike prices on existing series of FCOs as well as ``inverse'' or European-term contracts on those currencies presently listed on the Exchange, and cross-rate contracts on any two of the existing eight currencies on which the Exchange presently lists FCOs (i.e., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  the British pound, Swiss franc, French franc, Deutsche mark, Japanese yen, Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, and European Currency Unit). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> European-Term FCOs <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The first addition to the array of previously proposed customized FCOs that the Exchange now proposes to offer is the European-term contract. The Exchange presently lists options on eight foreign currencies. Each of these FCO contracts is structured so that the trading currency is the U.S. dollar ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  French franc/U.S. dollar). The option is quoted in U.S. dollars per unit of the relevant foreign currency and the premium is paid in U.S. dollars. Upon exercise of a call option, for example, the relevant foreign currency would be delivered. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The European-term customized FCO contract would be the inverse of the FCO contracts just described ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  U.S. dollar/French franc). The option will be quoted in units of the foreign currency per U.S. dollar and the premium will be paid in the foreign currency. Because the underlying currency is the U.S. dollar, U.S. dollars will be delivered upon exercise of a call option. The title of proposed Rule 1069 <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  will be changed to ``Customized Options'' to reflect the fact that users will be able to customize FCO contracts in more aspects than merely the strike price. Exchange Rule 1000(13), which provides the definition of ``foreign currency,'' will also be amended to include the U.S. dollar so that U.S. dollars may be considered an underlying foreign currency under all applicable Exchange rules. Similarly, Rule 1009, which lists all of the approved underlying foreign currencies would also be amended, as well as the definitions of ``spot sales price'' and ``forward sales price'' in Rules 1000(16) and 1000(17). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Id. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 --> Cross-Rate FCOs <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The second proposed addition to the customized FCO facility proposed in File No. SR&hyph;Phlx&hyph;94&hyph;11 would allow the Exchange to offer the ability to trade any cross-rate FCO contract on any two foreign currencies approved for trading on the Exchange pursuant to Rule 1009. <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  For example, an option on the Swiss franc/Canadian dollar could be traded. The Exchange believes, however, that it would be inefficient to disseminate updated quotes on all of the possible combinations of cross-rate FCOs that could be created by all of the listed currencies now available. The Exchange believes that most will not be of wide spread interest but may appeal to only a limited number of customers or be active for only brief periods of time due to unpredictable political or economic events in the U.S. and abroad. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> The Exchange presently offers two standardized cross-rate FCOs, the Deutsche mark/Japanese yen and the British pound/Deutsche mark. The Exchange also has approval to trade the British pound/Japanese yen, however, it has not yet been made available for trading.

			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / Erratic growth predicted for UK economy The UK economy is likely to continue growing in the coming months, albeit at a slightly erratic pace, according to the Central Statistical Office's leading economic indicators. The longer leading index, which highlights trends 13 months in advance and is composed of a broad basket of economic statistics, has risen since April. This is primarily because of increases in housebuilding starts, rising business optimism and positive contributions from the yield curve. The shorter leading index, which points to trends five months in advance, has fallen in the first half of the year, although preliminary information suggests that it rose in July as a result of rising share prices and consumer confidence. This index incorporates data on borrowing, car registrations, share prices, business and consumer confidence surveys. The CSO said the coincident index, which monitors current trends, had increased steadily since the start of the year with M0 - the narrowest measure of money supply - and output data making a particularly strong contribution.</p>

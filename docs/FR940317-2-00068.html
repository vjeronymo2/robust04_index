As the HIV/AIDS epidemic matured, it became apparent that the AETCs had to shift their priorities from HIV/AIDS information transfer to more intensive clinical training. This shift was necessitated by the introduction of new therapeutic interventions, such as antiretroviral therapies, which offered the promise of delaying the onset of opportunistic infections associated with AIDS. The mission of the AETCs is to address the ever increasing issues surfacing because of the changes in the HIV epidemic by constantly adding new priorities to address new issues. The Bureau of Health Professions and the Division of Medicine have developed new strategic directions which will have to be more fully incorporated into the priorities of the AETC program. These strategic directions were published for public comment in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on November 18, 1993, 58 FR 60860. No comments were received during the 30-day comment period. These strategic directions will include an emphasis on generalism, a continued emphasis on minorities and the underserved and an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emphasis on interdisciplinary training. The AETCs will continue to provide multidisciplinary training for primary health care personnel in the care of people with Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) and other conditions related to infection with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Additional Information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Requests for technical or programmatic information should be directed to:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Elaine Daniels, M.D.,Ph.D, Chief, Health Professions HIV Education Branch,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AIDS Regional Education and Training, Centers Program, Bureau of Health Professions, Health Resources and Services Administration, Parklawn Building, room 4C&hyph;03, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, Maryland 20857,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Telephone: (301) 443&hyph;6364.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This program is listed at 93.145 in the Catalog of Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Domestic Assistance and is not subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372, Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs (as implemented through 45 CFR part 100).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This program is not subject to the Public Health System  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Reporting Requirements. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: March 11, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Ciro V.

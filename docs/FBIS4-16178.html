			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Today Barcelona welcomed Boris Yeltsin who  completed the official part of his visit to Spain yesterday.  [passage omitted] Boris Yeltsin briefly answered journalists's  questions.    [Begin Yeltsin recording] Foundations have been laid down  for  cooperation between us that I think will develop very actively  in the future, now that a treaty has been signed, together with  a number of important agreements. I consider my personal  contacts with the King, the government chairman, the chairman of  Catalonia, and other politicians a matter of no small  importance. This was a good contact on a human level. There is  nothing to divide us. We are united by Europe, the European  issues we have in common, the questions of security common to  all of us, and of course the issue of economic stability both in  Russia and in Spain. There is a lot we can learn here, and I  was interested to hear about the Spanish experience of the  transitional period, which we too are currently going through.  There are some lessons we can learn from it, and this will be  beneficial to Russians and to Russia itself. [end recording]    The Russian president's plane is expected to land in Moscow  very shortly.</p>

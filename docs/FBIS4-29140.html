			<p>BFN     [Text] A dissolution of Parliament would not have a  significant negative impact on the country's economic growth,  bankers and securities analysts said yesterday.    Despite the possibility that the government may dissolve  Parliament or reshuffle the coalition if it fails to win a  compromise over constitutional changes, many analysts are  confident the growth rate for the entire year will stay above 8  percent.    If the government motion for constitutional changes is  defeated today and Parliament is dissolved, the shock to the  economy would only last one to two months, according to Olan  Chaiprawat, president of Siam Commercial Bank.    Still, the growth rate for all of 1994 would remain above 8  percent. He said the political crisis would not lead to a "dead  end" for Thailand's economy which he predicted would post a  growth rate of 8.1 percent even with a House dissolution.    "There is nothing to worry about in the short run. The world  economy is recovering. There is nothing to worry about at all,  even if Parliament is dissolved," he said optimistically in an  interview with The Nation.    He emphasized yesterday that a change in the government was  a  normal process in a democracy.    The stock market reacted cautiously yesterday to the  uncertain political outlook with a moderate 1.4 percent drop, by  19.35 points to 1,359.53.    Olan said the government should decide how to best improve  the situation.    "I believe that if the government announces a House  dissolution tonight (last night), the stock index will rise  tomorrow (this morning) since investors prefer a more stabilized  situation," he said.    Worawi Wangli, president of Nakhonthon Bank, said the  situation is not as bad as during the May 1992 bloodshed.    He said the Thai Bankers Association would not become  involved in the political crisis. "This is the task of  politicians," he said.    An analyst at Thai Investment &amp; Securities Co said if  the  government is defeated today, the stock market support line  would be 1,332 points, and if the situation worsened, the index  could plunge to 1,284 points.    "If the House is dissolved or the Cabinet is reshuffled, the  resistance line may be between 1,372-1,392 points," the analyst  predicted.    She added that any impact on the economy would be shortlived  but she did not expect an important impact on the stock market  as at most, only some political figures would be changed, and  that would not dramatically affect economic structures.    Somchai Phakaphasawiwat, adviser to the House's economic  subcommittee, said some infrastructure projects could be further  delayed if there is a political change and that could affect the  overall economy. However, economic growth will remain healthy  as the budgets for the fiscal year would be spent as usual.    "The stock market may benefit from the change as foreign and  local investors see a clearer political situation. Volatility  may occur, but only for a short time," said Somchai.</p>

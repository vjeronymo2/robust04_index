			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / Australia airports profits rise Australia's Federal Airports Corporation, the government-owned organisation which runs most of the nation's airports and is coming up for privatisation, yesterday posted an after-tax profit of ADollars 36m (Pounds 17.9m) in the year to end-June. The net result compared with ADollars 28.6m in the previous 12-month period. The FAC said that total numbers handled by the 22 airports under its control rose by 6.2 per cent to around 50m. Pre-tax earnings were 5 per cent higher at ADollars 94m, while revenues stood at ADollars 457.2m compared with ADollars 429.8m previously. Australia's Labor government won approval for the sale of the airports, reckoned to raise around ADollars 2bn, from rank and file supporters at a party conference earlier this year. Where possible, however, the airports will be sold piecemeal rather than in 'bundles', and the properties will be sold on a long leasehold basis. A number of European groups, including Britain's BAA, are known to be interested in acquisition, especially for larger properties.</p>

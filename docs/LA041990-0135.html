			<p><P> April 19, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FILM STUDIOS' BIDDING WAR CREATING $1-MILLION SCRIPTS  </P> <P> With a mixture of horror, elation and awe, Hollywood has watched for the last  three days as some of its biggest companies vied for, of all things, a film  script.  </P> <P> By several reports, 20th Century Fox began the bidding for 28-year-old writer  Shane Black's new screenplay, "The Last Boy Scout," at $850,000 on Monday.  </P> <P> Universal Pictures quickly entered the fray but dropped out at just over $1  million.  </P> <P> Warner Bros. and a partnership between Tri-Star and Carolco Pictures joined the  bidding for the script -- about a down-on-his-luck private eye who teams up  with an ex-football star to solve a murder -- but so did the David Geffen Co.,  an independent producer that distributes through Warner.  </P> <P> By Tuesday night, the price was up to $2 million, a bid posted by  Carolco/Tri-Star, but Black said he preferred to make the film with  Geffen/Warner, where he had worked before. So Geffen came up a winner at $1.75  million -- an apparent record, and nearly double the $1-million-plus prices  that have become almost routine in the last several months.  </P> <P> Black, best known as creator of Warner's "Lethal Weapon," declined to discuss  the sale, as did his agents, David Greenblatt and Bill Block of InterTalent.  </P> <P> David Geffen, who produced "Beetlejuice," declined to discuss the price. But he  said he bid for the script simply because "I can see a movie in it. It's not  maybe a movie. It's definitely a movie, and those aren't easy to find."  </P> <P> In any case, the episode marks the latest round in a phenomenal bidding war  that is boosting the fortunes of some screenwriters beyond what most dreamed  possible when they staged a five-month strike just 19 months ago.  </P> <P> Over the last year, Hollywood companies have fought an escalating battle for  "spec scripts" -- screenplays written on speculation, often by inexperienced  writers, without first having been commissioned by a producer or studio.  </P> <P> The boom has been fed partly by a push to expand movie slates at Fox, Walt  Disney Co.'s Hollywood Pictures unit and particularly at Columbia Pictures  Entertainment, where Sony Corp.'s new managers have spent heavily on scripts  since buying the studio last year.  </P> <P> Executives at several studios claim to detest the bidding wars, which has  pushed the price of scripts far beyond the $300,000 benchmark that was common  barely a year ago.  </P> <P> "To get $1 million, it used to have to be a damned good script. Now, you  practically pay that for the idea alone and wind up with a lot of rewrites. . .  . It's completely out of hand," said David Hoberman, head of Disney's  Touchstone unit, which has stayed out of the auctions.  </P> <P> "I hate these auctions, I really do," said another executive who was among the  bidders for Black's screenplay. Yet the same executive adds: "The market is  giving writers some of the due that went to actors a couple of years ago, and  to directors last year."  </P> <P> Writers have clearly enjoyed some high points in the past. In 1967, for  instance, William Goldman sold his "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" script  for $400,000 -- an amount equal to roughly $1.6 million today, when adjusted  for inflation.  </P> <P> Precise figures paid for screenplays aren't publicly available, but many  industry executives believe that Black's sale far exceeded previous highs of  just over $1 million. The screenplay apparently was especially attractive to  studios because it is action-oriented, crafted well enough to attract a  big-name director and actors, and commercial enough to promise the beginning of  a "franchise" -- Hollywood terminology for a chain of money-making sequels.  </P> <P> Ironically, the studios' hunger for spec scripts set in just as the  "development" process -- the agonizing system by which executives pay writers  to create and rewrite scripts based on ideas they have discussed in advance --  was becoming much tougher.  </P> <P> In the last decade, the vast bulk of movie scripts were sold under development  deals, which guarantee seasoned writers payments that routinely exceed $200,000  for a script but exact a heavy toll in terms of creative freedom.  </P> <P> According to partially complete statistics from the Writers Guild of America  West, roughly 83% of all Hollywood movie scripts were sold under development  deals last year, down from 91% in 1986.  </P> <P> Even as the percentage of screenplays written in development deals eased  downward, studio executives appeared to demand increasing control over the  creative process -- a crackdown that some writers and agents attribute to the  five-month writers strike in 1988, when studio executives had free time to  review and tighten their development practices.  </P> <P> "It's much more worked out than it used to be," said Jim Kouf ("Disorganized  Crime"), who writes and produces films under contract to Disney. "Now, they  want to hear all about the three acts in a screenplay. They want to know  exactly what they're buying."  </P> <P> Several observers maintain that a more stringent development process has killed  even the "pitch" -- an age-old ritual in which writers propose ideas to  executives, who may take them or leave them.  </P> <P> "Pitching now seems outdated" for all but a handful of the most prestigious  writers, such as Robert Towne ("Tequila Sunrise") or Joe Eszterhas ("Jagged  Edge"), said one top writers' agent who declined to be identified. "Studios are  self-generating their own projects, and then they 'audition' writers to see who  can carry out their ideas."  </P> <P> Chafing under such tight control and lured by growing money in the spec market,  some seasoned professional writers say they are increasingly tempted to forgo  the security of development deals in favor of the auction circuit.  </P> <P> "I hear the same stories you do, and I say, 'Hey, shouldn't I be writing on  spec?' " said Dan Petrie Jr., who is currently under contract to Disney and  whose credits include "Beverly Hills Cop."  </P> <P> Other seasoned writers privately complain that some of the biggest spec sales  have gone to inexperienced writers who apparently hit the jackpot in the latest  boom because they weren't tied to development contracts.  </P> <P> Columbia's new co-chairmen, Jon Peters and Peter Guber, grabbed Hollywood  attention with one such deal earlier this year when they agreed to pay a young  writer, David Mickey Evans, more than $1 million to write and direct "Radio  Flyer," which will be his first big studio film.  </P> <P> Another newcomer, former William Morris agent Rick Jaffa, teamed up with a  client, Doug Richardson, to write a World War II action comedy called "Hell  Bent . . . And Back" -- and promptly garnered a reported $1-million fee from  Hollywood Pictures.  </P> <P> "I had the idea years ago, and I felt a time would come for it in the  marketplace. I knew in my gut it would sell," said Jaffa, who declined to  discuss the terms of his Disney deal.  </P> <P> Still, others familiar with the screenplay say the writers and their William  Morris agent were stunned when Disney's Hollywood unit "preempted" the  screenplay by putting a $1-million offer on the table within 18 hours of seeing  it, on the condition that the script be withheld from bidding by other  production companies to which it had been promised.  </P> <P> Despite Disney's frequent criticism of overspending by other companies, the  studio's new Hollywood Pictures unit has also paid high prices for completed  scripts by recent USC film school graduate Amanda Silver, who is Jaffa's wife,  and others in a push to expand production quickly. Hollywood Pictures chief  Ricardo Mestres declined to discuss the purchases.  </P> <P> Yet some film executives revel in the hunt-and-kill dynamic of a big auction,  even while expressing dismay at rising prices. "I don't know of anything that  generates the excitement of the chase after a big script," said John Goldwyn,  executive vice president of worldwide production at MGM/UA Communications Co.  </P> <P> Script auctions occur suddenly, with little warning from agents, who try to  hide their wares until the last minute -- partly because clients may be tempted  by low offers if a potentially hot screenplay is leaked to buyers in advance.  In recent months, executives say, auctions among as many as six or eight  potential buyers have taken shape roughly once every 10 days.  </P> <P> Intrinsic merit may be enough to trigger bids. "It's that elusive hook. Who  knows what it is, but you know it when you hear it," said Kouf, who sold  "Disorganized Crime" as a spec script.  </P> <P> Yet fancy legwork by agents from InterTalent, Morris, International Creative  Management, Triad, Leading Artists and elsewhere appears to account for much of  the interest that distinguishes a hot script from the three dozen or more  screenplays that are circulated weekly by the leading agencies.  </P> <P> The more aggressive agents usually place their best scripts with a small  circuit of preferred studios or heavily bankrolled production companies, such  as Carolco or Largo Entertainment, that are judged likely to engage in a  bidding war.  </P> <P> (Creative Artists Agency, Hollywood's biggest talent agency, has been less  inclined than rivals to fish for such bids on spec scripts, preferring instead  to match much of its best material with directors or actors who are also  represented by the agency, so that the script can be sold with other talent  attached. "Philosophically, (they're) about getting movies made, not just the  script sale," said one executive familiar with CAA.)  </P> <P> Agents often try to generate heat around a script by withholding it from the  studios and giving it instead to favored producers under contract to the big  companies -- for instance, Joel Silver ("Lethal Weapon") at Warner Bros., or  Stanley Jaffe and Sherry Lansing ("Fatal Attraction") at Paramount.  </P> <P> "It keeps things more personal. That's what studios pay all these producers for  -- for their relationships," explained Lucas Foster, a development executive  who recently left Scott Rudin Productions.  </P> <P> The system allows agents to maintain a certain tension among rival producers on  the same lot, all of whom are hungry for the best shot at material that, in  most cases, will ultimately be funded from the studio coffers through the  producers' contractual arrangements.  </P> <P> Some big purchases, particularly for lesser-known writers, may be triggered by  one of several small networks of young development executives who protect each  other against the worst sin -- simply not knowing about a supposedly hot script  -- by sharing information and opinions about material despite their competitive  positions.  </P> <P> "We reciprocate. . . . Friends take care of each other," said one development  executive, who declined to be identified.  </P> <P> Heat, wherever it comes from, can disappear as quickly as it wells up in  Hollywood. Some big bids, all based on telephone conversations, simply fail to  materialize as second thoughts set in.  </P> <P> In other cases, screenplays that command big fees may be instantly "turned  around" -- released for possible production by other companies -- because of  management shifts. Thus, even the material purchased recently at Columbia is  under review by new executives who were brought in by Guber and Peters to fill  the top film jobs at the Tri-Star and Columbia units.  </P> <P> The real question, said John Watson, who recently co-wrote a Robin Hood story  called "Prince of Thieves" with Pen Densham and sold it to Morgan Creek for $1  million, is: "How many of these things we've paid so much money for do we  actually make?"  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Maks Khazin article: "Court Valued S. Baburin's Honor and </F> Dignity 25 Times More Cheaply Than He Himself"]    [Text] The first court series in the protracted process of  examining Sergey Baburin's suit against IZVESTIYA and retired  KGB General Oleg Kalugin in respect of protecting his honor and  dignity has ended. He was prompted to turn to the court by O.  Kalugin's public statement to the effect that in the past S.  Baburin had been recruited by the KGB as an agent. The  statement was made at the conference "The KGB: Yesterday,  Today, Tomorrow" organized by the "Glasnost" public fund and was  at once carried by many mass media, including IZVESTIYA.    Not that Baburin turned to the court right away. First he  sent a letter to the Russian General Prosecutor's Office  proposing that criminal proceedings be instituted against the  offender for slander under Article 130 of the Russian Soviet  Federal Socialist Republic Criminal Code.    No grounds were found, however, to throw the KGB ex-general  behind bars, although the deponent was told that the Ministry of  Security had no information about his, Baburin's, secret  cooperation with it. Possessing this information, IZVESTIYA  told its readers about it in the article "Not Discovered in the  Lists of Agents..." (No. 206, 28 October 1993). You might think  that this was the end of the conflict and that the honest name  of the plaintiff was restored. Not at all. He not only  continued to insist on a court investigation but also raised the  stakes: He increased the price of his honor and dignity from 10  million rubles [R] in the original version of the suit to R100  million.    The first information in IZVESTIYA about the distinguished  agent appeared 23 February last year in S. Mostovshchikov's  reportage "Yesterday the KGB, Today the Russian Ministry of  Security, Tomorrow the KGB Again?" The court did not summon  that author as a respondent. Rightly so: The law "On the Mass  Media" frees both an editorial board and a journalist from the  responsibility to reproduce speeches by delegates to various  conferences, congresses, and plenums.    Nevertheless, at the final stage of the process the court  nominated another respondent -- journalist Nataliya Gevorkyan.  In the article "KGB Agents Can Sleep Soundly" (IZVESTIYA 27  February 1993) she had reproduced the same Kalugin speech and  taken advantage of her professional right to expound her own  personal views and judgments in this regard. She paid the price.    The testimony of witness K. Gorbunov, who once "served" Omsk  University along KGB lines, sounded impressive: "I did not  recruit Baburin." Answering a question from a representative of  the editorial board, however -- if another plaintiff, really an  informant, had been in Baburin's place, would he, Gorbunov, have  imparted this to the court? -- he replied honestly: No, I would  not have told it, despite having given a written undertaking  accepting responsibility for giving false evidence.    Kalugin's interests were defended by well-known attorney B.  Kuznetsov. He asked the court to listen to tape recordings of  conversations with another chekist (he preferred not to appear  before the court), who in fact spoke about secret cooperation  between the KGB and the dean of Omsk University's Law Faculty.  Unfortunately the court refused this.    This was not, however, the only motiveless refusal to  satisfy  defense pleas. Kuznetsov submitted a document to the court --  Order No. 00140 of the USSR KGB chairman of 4 July 1993 [date as  published] approving the "Statute on the Agency Apparatus and  Fiduciaries of USSR State Security Organs." It turns out that  "the basis of the agency apparatus is...made up of Soviet  citizens devoted to the cause of communism and to the socialist  motherland." They can be "CPSU members who are capable, in  terms of their political, moral, and businesslike data and  potential, of ensuring successful leadership of a group of  agents or fiduciaries." It is obligatory to be "politically  competent, to possess tough qualities and the ability to  convince people and to exercise the necessary influence over  them." And, of course, "sincere warmth, benevolence, and the  ability to achieve profound mutual understanding with people"  are definitely important features of a secret staffer.    Impressive, is it not? But this is still not everything.  In the section "Work with Agents" we read: "An agent must be  disciplined, show resourcefulness and initiative, and be able to  operate independently"; "an agent, regardless of the form of  recruitment, must be characterized by honesty and loyalty to the  obligations given to KGB organs." In the opinion of the  defense, anyone who has so many virtues has no right to complain  that moral harm has been done to his honor and dignity. On the  contrary, it is only possible to take pride in such a range of  positive qualities, since by no means everybody possesses them.    Respondent Kalugin went still further. In his view, he not  only did Baburin no harm with his expose but did him a good  service, strengthened his political positions among like-minded  people, and helped him to pick up additional votes in the last  elections -- for which the plaintiff should be grateful to him  and certainly not take him to court. He also asked leave to  submit the famous order (the editorial board's representative  joined in with this petition), but Judge S. Varenova refused.  Now this undoubtedly important document (just like the tape  recordings) will appear in the case only if there is an appeal.    Another argument of the respondents is interesting: Agents  were legalized by the Russian Federation Law "On Operational  Investigative Activity," which was also adopted by Baburin,  deputy of the former Supreme Soviet. How, then, can information  about a person's lawful activity discredit him?    Kuntsevskiy Intermunicipal People's Court did not satisfy  Baburin's material demands in full, but it obliged Kalugin to  apologize in the pages of IZVESTIYA and exacted from him R1.5  million in favor of the plaintiff, as well as state costs in the  sum of R225,000. R2 million and R300,000 respectively were  levied on IZVESTIYA. They even took R500,000 for moral harm and  R75,000 in state costs from N. Gevorkyan, who turned up right at  the end (and to whom, incidentally, they never bothered to  present a copy of the statement of claim, as laid down in law).    The state costs are particularly touching: They are not  exacted at all in cases in this category. Although Judge  Varenova might well not have known this, since this was the  first time she had examined such a case. But IZVESTIYA has  addressed this problem repeatedly, insisting that state costs be  exacted when the statement of claim is lodged, as in all other  civil cases. This would undoubtedly restrain the money  appetites of those who pretend to be defending their honor while  at the same time not forgetting about strictly prosaic worldly  boons.    We will inform our readers of further movement in the case.</p>

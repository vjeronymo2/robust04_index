			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Colombian President Cesar Gaviria at the Narino </F> Palace in Santa Fe de Bogota -- live]    [Text] Colombians: Today we experienced one of the most  important moments in the history of our nation when we chose the  person who will rule the country until August 1998. We did this  with an unprecedented democratic spirit and with a turnout that  far exceeded that recorded during the first round on 29 May.  Voter turnout surpassed 7.3 million; that is, we registered the  highest turnout in the country's history.    As president of the Republic, I am moved by the fact that we  fulfilled our democratic duty peacefully, and I therefore want  to congratulate each and every one of the millions of Colombians  who voted today to work toward a better future for this country  that we love so much.    First I want to congratulate the victor, who by the  Colombians' decision will be president of the Republic on 7  August. I want to congratulate and express my admiration for  Ernesto Samper Pizano and Jaquin [Samper's wife] and to voice my  most ardent and sincere wishes that his government will be  successful in the search for peace, well-being, and social  justice for Colombians.    As a partner in the Liberal struggles for many years and as  an important member of this administration, Ernesto Samper was a  victim of the blind violence that has brought so much suffering  to this nation. Nevertheless, his experience strengthened his  determination, and he will dedicate the second chance life  granted him to advancing his ideals for a better country; a  tolerant, pluralist country that respects human rights. He will  create new jobs. I know these things will happen because he  undoubtedly has all the qualities needed to achieve these goals.    Humberto de la Calle will be a loyal partner at the vice  presidency, and from there he will always contribute his  intelligence, good judgment, and valuable experiences to  strengthening our democracy.    I also want to congratulate Andres Pastrana Arango. I owe  him my thanks for his generous support for my government in  difficult times. The campaign he has conducted and his human  and professional capabilities have won him immense support from  the citizens. Both he and his running mate, former Labor  Minister Luis Fernando Ramirez, were worthy candidates for this  electoral debate. I applaud the patriotic gesture by Andres  Pastrana a few moments ago when he recognized the results of  this election.    The National Civil Registry has once again earned the  applause of all Colombians. As president of the Republic, I  wish to congratulate the registrar and each official of that  institution.    The high turnout in today's elections shows the democratic  maturity of the Colombian people. There is no doubt that we  have restored our faith in our potential, in our ability to face  adversity, and in the fine qualities of our people. It is also  a demonstration of the benefits of the ballot, of the second  round as established by the Constitution, and of the spirit of  democratic participation as established by the 1991  Constitution. It is a demonstration of the desire for peace of  a vast majority of the Colombian people. Without a doubt, we  have made progress in the construction of a better future for  our children and for new generations of Colombians.    Colombians; there are times in a nation's life when the  courage of its people is tested. Today we have shown once again  that nothing can stop this country on its road to a better  future. Nothing in the world is capable of stopping the firm  convictions of a united people who have confidence in their  ability to take the reins of their future in their own hands.    Thank you very much and good night.</p>

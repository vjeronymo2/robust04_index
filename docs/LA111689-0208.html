			<p><P> November 16, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FOUNTAIN VALLEY COUNCIL MAKES MOVE TO EASE THE RAISING OF WATER RATES  </P> <P> The City Council has moved a step closer to increasing local water rates with  the adoption of a new amendment changing the way such rates are raised.  </P> <P> On Tuesday night, the council voted to change water rates by means of a  resolution, instead of an ordinance. A resolution can take effect in 30 days,  compared to 90 days for ordinances, city officials said.  </P> <P> Elizabeth Fox, the city's fiscal services manager, said the council probably  would consider an increase in water rates at the beginning of the year. Rates  have not been increased since 1985.  </P> <P> "At the current time, the operating costs of the water fund are exceeding the  revenue," Fox said. "So some changes will probably have to be made."  </P> <P> Fox said the amendment was part of the council's effort to update many of the  city's 25-year-old codes.  </P> <P> "This just makes it a lot easier to modify and change the codes," Fox said.  </P></p>

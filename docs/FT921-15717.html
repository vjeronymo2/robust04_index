			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: European food This week's purchase by Saint Louis of a 13.8 per cent stake in Source Perrier is another intriguing development in the Agnelli family's pan-European food strategy. The ultimate goal may remain obscure, but the latest deal has two immediate implications. It notably strengthens the Italian grip on France's much-prized water company, and it underlines the growing alliance between the Agnellis and Maison Worms. These two families are openly acting in concert at St Louis, where they have more than 50 per cent of the votes. By combining the new St Louis stake in Perrier with the 35 per cent held by Exor, the quoted holding company for which the Agnellis are currently making a full bid, they will now own 49 per cent of Perrier. Under French takeover rules that should trigger a partial bid for the rest, though minority shareholders should not expect any favours. The Agnellis would not be required to pay more than the FF1,235 per share forked out this week by St Louis, and with effective control already in their hands they will hardly want to. The more interesting question is whether a more substantial shake-up of food and drink assets in France is on the cards. Notwithstanding stakes in BSN held directly through the Agnelli vehicle Ifil (5.8 per cent) and indirectly via St Louis (3 per cent), a full bid for the food giant is difficult to envisage. It would be hugely expensive, would cause deep political ructions and would simply not be the Agnelli style. The Agnellis and their French friends are nevertheless emerging as a powerful new force in the European food industry, ready to mount a serious challenge to the likes of Nestle and Unilever in the 1990s.</p>

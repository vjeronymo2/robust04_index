			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Black Horse is favourite to win the profits race - The first of the English clearing banks to disclose its 1991 results SIR JEREMY MORSE, the chairman of Lloyds Bank who is soon to retire, thinks of himself as a banker faute de mieux. He originally joined a bank - Glynn Mills, now part of Royal Bank of Scotland - to acquire some professional skills in preparation for taking the helm of his family's East Anglian brewery. 'However Watneys bought the brewery', he said yesterday, 'So things turned out rather differently'. At the age of 63, he is now planning to stand down. 'On April 1, I will have been chairman for 15 years', he added. 'That is rather too long . . . I will leave here at the end of the year or early next year'. However, his successor is likely to be found rather sooner so that he or she can work alongside Sir Jeremy for several months. Sir Jeremy is leaving at the apex of the bank's fortunes relative to its peers. Lloyds was yesterday the first of the English clearing banks to disclose its 1991 results and analysts are convinced that it will emerge as the most profitable of them - even though its balance sheet is half the size of Barclays' and National Westminster's respectively. Lloyds' 1991 pre-tax profits were Pounds 645m, 9 per cent higher than the previous year, even though the bank suffered record losses on its UK loans of Pounds 885m. Thanks to a drop in the tax rate, profits after tax rose 22 per cent to Pounds 357m. There was a small increase - of 3 per cent  - in interest income to Pounds 2.35bn. Mr Brian Pitman - Lloyds' chief executive who with Sir Jeremy is regarded by analysts as an architect of the bank's success - said the bank had benefited indirectly from the absence of demand for loans from UK companies and consumers. In the absence of such demand, Lloyds was able to reduce its reliance on the money markets as a source of funds to lend. Such borrowing from the money markets is far more expensive for a bank than taking deposits from personal customers. Other operating income - including revenue from Lloyds' highly successful life insurance operations, Abbey Life and Black Horse Life - rose 5 per cent to Pounds 1.63bn. However, the bank succeeded in avoiding any increase in overheads. Indeed staff costs fell 4 per cent. Earnings per share rose 21 per cent to 28.6p, but the full year dividend has been increased by 9 per cent to 16.7p for the year. 'I did not want to pay more, having made it clear last year that we wanted dividend cover (the ratio of earnings to dividends) to rise from last year's level of 1.5 times', Sir Jeremy said. Dividend cover is now 1.7. Nonetheless, analysts had been expecting a smaller dividend increase. They point out that other big banks cannot afford to increase their dividends at all. Midland is likely to omit a payment for the second half of 1991. As Sir Jeremy and Mr Pitman, never tire of saying, their prime aim is to reward the banks' shareholders. Their motives are not purely altruistic. A recent report by the stockbrokers UBS Phillips &amp; Drew pointed out that Mr Pitman has a personal stake in Lloyds worth close to Pounds 1m whereas the chief executives of Barclays, Midland and NatWest have personal shareholdings with a combined value of only Pounds 100,000. But despite the emphasis on dividend growth and an eschewing of rights issues to finance expansion - Lloyds has not had a rights issue since Sir Jeremy took the helm - the bank is also likely to emerge as the bank with the strongest balance sheet, as measured in terms of the ratio of capital to assets. Its risk asset ratio, the new international standard for assessing balance sheet strength, was 9.7 per cent at the end of the year, up from 8.5 per cent. The ratio would have been higher still, if Lloyds had chosen to write back into its accounts some of the provisions it made three years ago to cover the risk of losses on loans to less developed countries. These provisions total Pounds 2.8bn, equivalent to 75 per cent of its LDC exposure. However prices of LDC loans in the international markets suggest that Lloyds may be taking too pessimistic a view of the likely losses on this exposure. Colin Wilks, Lloyds' chief financial officer, said that if the bank sets its provisions at the level of market prices, around Pounds 900m of capital would be released for the bank's use. So even if loan losses do not diminish in 1992, as Sir Jeremy fears, the balance sheet should remain robust. Sir Jeremy himself may not be around to steer the bank through the eventual recovery in the UK economy, but he confirmed yesterday that Mr Pitman - who reached Lloyds' official retirement age of 60 last year - will stay on for at least another couple of years. Some analysts believe that Lloyds pre-tax profits will exceed Pounds 1bn by the time Mr Pitman goes - which will give some satisfaction to the brewer manque.</p>

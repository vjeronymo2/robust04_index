			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / Fractious partners put Andreotti's political skills to test: The Italian government's stability has been undermined barely a month after taking office ITALY'S 50th post-war government is badly frayed at the edges just a month after taking office. Two key problems are undermining the government's stability: intractable opposition to plans to cut public spending and a long-running row over constitutional reform. The fractious four-party coalition has opted to soldier on until the end of the current legislature in 1992, rather than call early elections. In doing so it has lumbered the country with a lame duck government unable to take pressing political decisions. The coalition has called a meeting for May 11 and it might be forced to the polls early unless it can settle its differences. Last Friday Mr Guido Carli, the veteran Treasury minister pledging to sort out the country's messy finances, was said to be threatening to resign following opposition to his proposed spending cuts. Mr Carli wants to trim the country's huge budget deficit, targeted at L132,000bn (Pounds 60.4bn) this year. Pension reform and a public-sector pay curb are designed to help raise the L15,000bn-L16,000bn needed to bring this year's government spending back into line. But the Socialists and some Christian Democrats in the government are refusing to accept the cuts, partly for fear of public unpopularity. Mr Claudio Martelli, the Socialist deputy premier, said last week the pension and public-sector pay cuts were not part of the programme agreed by coalition parties last month. Mr Franco Marini, the former trade union leader, who is the new Christian Democrat minister of labour, has also voiced objections. The dispute comes as no surprise to Mr Giorgio La Malfa, head of the small Republican party which last month pulled out of the coalition after a clash with Mr Giulio Andreotti, Italian premier, over ministerial posts. 'We called for early elections on an agreed basis in order to save the next finance bill from the pressure of the elections ahead,' he explains. 'Otherwise we knew the influence of the polls would just increase the temptation to raise spending.' Failure to put Italy's messy finances in order would mean a larger government deficit, possibly triggering higher interest rates and inflation, along with the risk of an economic downturn. With pensions and public-sector pay apparently sacrosanct, a mixed bag of indirect tax rises and new levies is likely, with structural reform once again being left until after the polls, if not beyond. Last month's much-publicised decision by Moody's, the US debt rating agency, to review Italy's top-notch triple-A borrowing status has heightened party leaders' awareness of international attention focusing on the nation's deteriorating finances. Criticism of domestic economic management has also come from the International Monetary Fund and the Bundesbank. Half-hearted measures would be unlikely to convince foreign investors, who play an important role in financing Italy's debt, that the country's politicians are about to get to grips with the deficit. Mr Andreotti has remained silent about both the political storm and this week's renewed outbursts by the president, Mr Francesco Cossiga, over constitutional reform, the issue which was partly to blame for the collapse of Mr Andreotti's previous government. Mr Cossiga wants the government to push through fundamental constitutional reform, including changes to the electoral system, the election of the president and differentiation of the roles of the two houses of parliament. He accepted the cabinet's decision to put off the most important proposals until after next year's polls but, apparently unable to set the issue aside, he has aired his views almost daily to the media. As president, Mr Cossiga's interventions can cause no immediate political threat to the cabinet, but his comments are embarrassing the government and have fuelled the crisis. He has also clashed with the Christian Democrats - his former party. Two of his most recent targets have been berated for speaking to newspapers that fail to meet the president's approval. The president has singled out La Repubblica, Italy's biggest-selling newspaper, for attack. He describes the paper, owned by Mr Carlo De Benedetti, as being the mouthpiece for the 'politico-financial lobby' which he claims has been waging a two-year campaign against him. With tensions within the coalition rising, and Mr Cossiga firing off in all directions, Mr Andreotti will need all his skills to smooth over the latest set of upsets threatening his new government.</p>

			<p><P> October 6, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> B. Altman's Put Up For Sale: The troubled L. J. Hooker Corp. put B. Altman  &amp; Co. on the auction block and said it intends to sell the seven-unit  department store chain as quickly as possible. "Given the cash constraints of  L. J. Hooker . . . we believe that a quick sale of Altman's is in the best  interests of all concerned," said Sanford C. Sigoloff. He is the turnaround  specialist who was named chairman of L. J. Hooker in August at the same time  the company filed for Chapter 11 federal bankruptcy protection for certain  subsidiaries, including Altman's. Hooker is the Atlanta-based U.S. subsidiary  of Australia's Hooker Corp., which had invested more than $1 billion in U.S.  shopping malls, real estate and retailing during the past three years before  high interest rates and a soft Australian real estate market put the company in  a financial bind.  </P></p>

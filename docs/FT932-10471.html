			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / UK Company News: C&amp;J Clark rejects Berisford offer - Tears and cheers greet decision and chairman considers his future SHAREHOLDERS of C&amp;J Clark, the private shoe company, yesterday voted narrowly against proposals to sell the business to Berisford International for Pounds 184m. Instead shareholders have been promised a new board structure, a shareholders' council and a flotation within five years. At an emotional meeting held in Shepton Mallett, Somerset, two hours of debate over the ownership of the group ended with 34.1m votes in favour and 37.8m against the resolution to sell. The result was greeted by tears of joy and cheers as shareholders of the 168-year-old company embraced each other. Mr Walter Dickson, chairman of Clark, said: 'The board will now work towards achieving agreement on how best to take advantage of the great strength of its brands and people.' He added he would be considering his own position over the weekend. Shoes, the acronym for opponents of the sale, found itself on the other foot, now supporting the new plans. It said: 'This is a vote for the future of Clarks and its flotation in due course.' Ms Harriet Hall said Shoes had no interest in delaying the implementation of a new corporate structure. Mr Hugh Pym, also of Shoes, added: 'We hope that all shareholders can now work together.' The toe-to-toe arguments took place in the less-than-dramatic surroundings of an agricultural hall on The Royal Bath and West of England showground at Shepton Mallett against the backdrop of riot police and their dogs training and tractors trundling by. Inside the hall about 600 shareholders, many of them fifth generation members of the founding Clark family, debated the proposals. Outside family members put aside their disagreements and picnicked in bright sunshine. Last night Mr Alan Bowkett, chief executive of Berisford, said he was saddened that Clark had not accepted the Berisford proposal. The deal would have been the first acquisition for Berisford's new management team. Mr Bowkett said the company was in discussions with a number of other parties and attention would now focus on these. During the meeting debate centred on whether Clark could remain independent and bring to an end the disagreements between shareholders which have hampered the business. Those in favour of the bid, which was recommended by seven of the 11 directors including the chairman, said the Berisford was the only certain solution to the company's problems. Opponents put forward plans for a shareholder council to direct the board on important financial matters and a flotation within five years. Mr Dickson said the ideas were 'excellent in principle but I do not believe they represent a certain alternative to the Berisford proposal'. Mr Lance Clark, a non-executive director opposed to the sale, said it was 'an idiotic time to sell'. The proposed new board structure would 'provide the leadership and direction needed to deliver the three-year business plan'. He added that he and two other directors, who were also against the sale, were now committed to a flotation. Three weeks ago they had felt it better for the company to remain private. Mrs Clark, a shareholder who had taken the 'painful' decision to sell, said: 'I wish I could believe Lance Clark, but I do not believe the agonising disputes will end.' Mr Pym said the shareholders council would 'take the squabbling out of the boardroom and into a different forum'. Mr Daniel Clark, a former chairman, said the Shoes proposals could lead to indefinite prevarication, an 'alternative just too appalling to contemplate'. Earlier Mr Dickson told shareholders at the annual meeting, which preceded the special meeting, that an improvement in the company's performance was expected to continue. However he added: 'If Clarks were to continue as an independent company it would be important to re-establish prudent levels of dividend cover.' See Lex</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] As part of the security measures taken by the  Lebanese Army on the night of 10-11 March 1994 in the various  Lebanese areas, patrols of the General Directorate of the  Internal Security Forces and the Public and State Security  directorates, in coordination with the Army's intelligence  directorate, staged storming operations to arrest persons wanted  for crimes and others suspected of spreading rumors and making  threatening calls. A number of persons were arrested and are  being interrogated for referral to the judiciary.    Today's issue of the London-based AL-HAYAH newspaper cites  an  official source as saying that storming operations were not  exclusive to Kasrawan but covered all the areas, including  Beirut and its suburbs. The source affirmed that the Lebanese  security agencies and intelligence apparatus have a complete  file on various security incidents, including the Sayyidat  al-Najat [church] explosion. This file gives us clear clues to  the culprits in these incidents, he said. However, he added,  clues are not sufficient in a country like Lebanon, because  there is a difference between evidence that convinces the  security organs and that which will convince the judiciary.    Responding to a question, the official source said that the  arrest campaigns dealt with more than 13 persons--explosives  experts and suspects, or people wanted in certain cases  involving deliberate attempts to mar the atmosphere and spread  panic among the public.    Replying to another question, the official source said that  the conduct of Lebanese Forces commander Samir Ja'ja' after the  explosion in the Sayyidat al-Najat church was not a political  move so much as a security move which he wanted to use to show  that others were being unjust to him or to forestall the  security forces from trying to uncover the culprits and thus  ease the worries of persons connected to him. The investigation  will entail interrogations of these persons for information the  investigators need, the source remarked.    He added: They leaked the story that the Army had stationed  soldiers at the entrances to the headquarters of Ja'ja' in  Ghidras and that the troops had tried to go in one of the  entrances but had retreated after an argument with the  headquarters guards. This is not true, the source said, adding:  The Army does not retreat before the guards of any  headquarters. The days when headquarters guards could do that  are over; it is no longer possible for any party to use force to  prevent the Army from entering any place or to light the fuse on  a certain front or instigate a battle. The Army is capable of  settling any military or security situation, he affirmed,  adding: To put it simply, the Army had no orders to enter this  particular headquarters.    Explaining the reason for the reinforcement of Army troops  in  Ghidras, the source said: As part of the storming operations  that started on Thursday, two of the Lebanese Forces' members  are wanted for interrogation; their leadership knows this. When  we demanded that these persons be turned over, they stirred up  that commotion in order to harm the military institution as part  of a coordinated campaign that started with the church  explosion. Some people have grudges against the military  institution, the source said.    He added that some persons in the Lebanese Forces  headquarters are wanted. Warrants have been issued for some of  them and some have been sentenced in absentia, including Raji  'Abduh, who is wanted in connection with the assassination  attempt against the president of the republic in 1991. Others  are wanted for interrogation and to testify in the case of the  church explosion. These people must be turned over, he said.  Some of these persons played a certain role or have information  about certain persons, he explained.    The official source told AL-HAYAH that the security file the  authorities are handling, in close coordination, includes  investigations into the explosion at the Phalangist Party  central headquarters and other incidents. More important in  this connection is that the Israeli network that the security  agencies discovered, some of whose suspected members have been  referred to the judiciary, has branches in the occupied border  strip and other areas. One of the major suspects in this  network has not yet been arrested, but he is known to be in a  certain area, which we will not reveal. This area is known to  us and to others, the source said.    The source believes that the Lebanese Forces are blowing the  case out of proportion in order to close the file and reach a  settlement with the state concerning their wanted members.</p>

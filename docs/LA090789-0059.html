			<p><P> September 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> The Soviet Union, bowing to demands of local residents, has abandoned plans to  complete a plant to dispose of chemical weapons at Chapayevsk on the Volga  River, Tass reported. In a sign of an increasing willingness by authorities to  listen to growing environmental concerns, the official Soviet news agency said  that a government commission has agreed to suspend construction of what it  called a "dangerous enterprise." Moscow, now negotiating a treaty with  Washington to ban chemical weapons, had intended to start using the plant later  this year. It was not clear from the Tass report if an alternative would be  found. Tass said people in the region where the plant was being built -- about  500 miles southeast of Moscow -- had protested its construction for a year.  </P></p>

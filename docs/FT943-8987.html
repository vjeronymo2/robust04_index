			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Rude food served here - Eating in Singapore Singapore is a peculiar place. It is in Asia, but it is not very Asian. If it were not for the hawkers' stalls, and the occasional whiff of durians, you might believe you were in some squeaky clean version of Chicago or Frankfurt-am-Main, only populated almost entirely by Chinamen. You get a better perspective if you cross to the seedy, scruffy little town of Johore Bahru: this is Singapore without the polish. Singaporeans go there in droves to buy cheap food and to chew gum. When they return on the bus and cross the causeway to Singapore, they stick the gum to the backs of seats. Singaporeans are rude. They were rude to me in the airport, even before I had passed through immigration and they were especially rude at the Boulevard Hotel. I thought that they would all be pig-rude until I met a jolly taxi driver who was keen to fill me in on Singapore's latest murder stories and who took me off to a more down-market hotel where the staff were a little better behaved than they were at the Boulevard. The next night I moved into the Oriental and all was sweetness and light. I understand that businessmen go to Singapore, but I do not think anyone goes there for pleasure. Japanese and Australians go to Singapore to shop, even though the prices are not as keen as they once were. Cultural tourism is a bit of a non-starter as there is precious little of old Singapore left and what there is has been 'Disneyfied' in a thoroughly repulsive manner. But, and here is a big but, you may eat well in Singapore. The best way to eat is to go native. All over the island there are hawkers' centres where the formerly mobile kitchens have been brought together. Various Chinese cooking styles are in evidence: Malayan food; Indonesian food; Indian food; and the Peranakan food of the native Straits Chinese. You can have great fun at the hawkers' centres. Only you should avoid the sanitised, perhaps 'pasteurised' is a better description, Telok Ayer Market with its fried chicken and go instead to the big shed on the other side of the main road which has yet to be faked. Similarly, you can do better than the rather twee Satay Club on Connaught Drive. The true gourmand revels in a Singaporean hawkers' centre. Duck and beef porridge, Indonesian rice and noodles, mutton satay, lots of exciting innards such as pigs' organ soup, pigs' ears, pigs' tails and bowls of beef broth swimming with tripe. You wander around the stalls picking what pleases you and then return to your seat. Within seconds the plates are slammed down on the table and a grasping paw is stretched out to the cry 'two dollars' (for that is all it costs). If you are quick you can also catch the arm of the person carrying bottles of the excellent local Tiger beer. Then your meal is complete. It is far from being a relaxing way to eat. After a week of it you are ready to concede that the French three-hour dinner is the greatest contribution to civilisation the world has known. On the other hand, street food is nourishing, and cheap. There are also restaurants where you may eat in this basic way. Swee Kee, in Middle Road, is almost next door to the Raffles Hotel. There, for about Dollars 3, you are given - thrown is more like it - a big portion of boiled chicken, chicken broth and rice. A dinner of this sort lasts at most 15 minutes. In little India you get chiefly south Indian food as well as some local specialities such as fish head curry - the eyes are said to be the best bit. I prefer the cheeks. Vegetarian food can be good here. The paper masala dosas, onion ottapams idlis and vadas were every bit as good as the ones I had eaten in Calcutta. Of course not everyone gets the chance to go native. If you are out on business, you will probably eat in a posh restaurant or a hotel. The Raffles Hotel has been reset in plastic and cloned to twice or three times its original size. True to form, a shopping centre has been installed in the wings. You should have a Singapore gin sling there, because that is where it was created. You may eat well at the Raffles too, but the best meal I ate in a restaurant was in Violet Oon's Kitchen. This is Peranakan or 'Nonya' cooking (a Nonya is a native Chinese woman with an infusion of Malay blood). The food adapts Chinese and Indian ideas and welds them to the local Malay diet. This is as near as you will get to the real Singapore and Oon is as hospitable as one could wish. The rest of them should be packed off to charm school. Information: The Oriental (tel: 338-0066.

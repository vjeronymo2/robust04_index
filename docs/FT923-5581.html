			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / Finance and the Family: Bonds - just too good to be true WITH-profits bonds are beginning to look misnamed. In theory they sound wonderful. They allow for lump sum investments in the same with-profits funds which life companies use for endowments. Each bond buys a number of units within the fund. Reversionary bonuses are declared and added to the value of the bond each year, along - normally - with a terminal bonus when surrendered. The bonds are open-ended, so investors can cash them at any time. This has made them a top seller over the last two years. For example, Prudential took Pounds 350m for its Prudence Bond in the first six months of this year, and Norwich Union's bond took Pounds 700m last year. This begins to look too good to be true. And, indeed, it is. This week, Lautro, the life assurance watchdog, bit into the claims which had been made when selling the bonds. After reviewing the promotional material for the bonds, Lautro ordered 13 companies - more than half of the 22 which have sold them - to withdraw some advertising. Of the 13, Equity &amp; Law and London &amp; Manchester were told to write to clients to clarify the bond's characteristics. Any clients of these two companies who claim, on receiving clarification, that they had been misled, will be entitled to refunds. So what was the problem? First, some claims were exaggerated. In particular, the watchdogs disliked the comparison many sales agents made with building society accounts. As must be the case with any with-profits investment, these bonds simply do not have the flexibility of a building society. But the problem goes beyond flexibility and convenience. These bonds also lack the security, not only of building societies, but also of other with-profits policies. This is because offices retain the right to make a Market Value Adjustment (MVA) when the bonds are surrendered. A reversionary bonus may be declared, but if market performance has been poor, the life office can withhold it by applying an MVA. There are valid reasons for this. Taking on big commitments in one go puts strain on life funds. This is hard enough to cope with when the money will not need to be paid out for 25 years. Paying out full reversionary bonuses after a year, when the market has fallen, would harm the funds of longer-term savers. There would also be the danger of investors exploiting the fund - selling when the market was at the bottom, and reinvesting elsewhere. So the actuaries need the MVA as a defence. Indeed, the MVA is as central to a with-profits bond as are reversionary and terminal bonuses. Unfortunately, MVAs did not look that way from the advertising. And, while actuaries need to make public bonus announcements, they have almost total discretion over how to apply an MVA. This is bad news for investors. For example, Equity &amp; Law, recently applied an MVA of 11 per cent - in other words, it took the value of the orignal investment plus bonuses, and then took off 11 per cent. The investor had bought on September 1991, and sold in July this year, a ridiculously short timespan for a with-profits investment, and as a result he was down on the deal. The bonds are not the greatest of news for life offices either. Norwich Union withdrew its bond citing capital strain, while several others are withdrawing early. These include Scottish Provident. Its bond proved popular because it guarantees not to apply MVAs on death, on regularly drawn income, or on the bond's fifth anniversary. It does not have a building society's flexibility, but at least it has some security. Otherwise, the bonds, like endowments, should only be considered by those who can look to the very long term.</p>

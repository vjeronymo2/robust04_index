			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Kozhikode, Dec. 28--The 69th all-India conference of  the Indian Medical Association (IMA) began here on Tuesday  calling for a ban on new medical colleges, reiterating the  demand for immunity for doctors from the Consumer Protection Act  and appealing to doctors of Third World countries to jointly  oppose the Dunkel proposals.    In his inaugural address, Dr. A.K.N. Sinha, president,  Medical Council of India, called upon doctors to get ready to  face "a storm which was closing in on them in the form of the  Consumer Protection Act." Opposition to the Act was voiced  throughout the conference which started its scientific sessions  on December 25. Dr. Sinha described the Act as "anti-people and  reactionary," as it would force doctors to resort to "defensive  medicine." It would create a U.S.-type situation with lawyers  biding their chance to sue doctors for compensation for alleged  medical neglect.    He also called upon doctors to oppose new medical colleges  as  the doctor-population ratio was already well above the required  level and addition of more medical practitioners was undesirable.    Dr. Sinha also said neither sufficient manpower nor material  was available for setting up more medical colleges. In this  context, he said that if the Medical Council of India were to  enforce the norms for medical colleges, 90 per cent of the  existing colleges, including those run by the Government, would  lose their recognition. "The Council was not withdrawing  recognition granted to these colleges only because it would harm  the interests of the students," he said.    Cheaper drugs demanded: Dr. P.K. Choudhuri,  representing the Tollygunge branch of the IMA, Calcutta, who was  installed as the new national president of the IMA, expressed  the same views and also highlighted the adverse effects Dunkel  proposals would have on the Indian medical scene. Dr. Choudhuri  said acceptance of the proposals would result in rise in prices  of even life-saving drugs. Even the affluent in society would be  affected. He urged the Government to orient policy to provide  cheaper drugs for common diseases. Quoting the prices of  medicines in various countries, he pointed out that drugs were  costly in countries which had adopted product patents of the  type advocated under Dunkel proposals.    Dr. Choudhuri said that if the proposals were accepted the  prices of drugs would go down in developed countries and go up  in developing countries. He declared that the fight against the  imposition of Dunkel proposals would be carried on with the help  of doctors in Third World countries. The platform of the South  Asian Medical Association (SAMA), which was formed at the  initiative of the IMA and comprised, Third World doctors--would  be used for this purpose.    Stressing the need for a ban on new medical colleges, he  said  that with about 10,000 doctors emerging from colleges every  year, there was no dearth of trained medical personnel. Against  the ideal of one doctor for a population of 3,500, going by the  register of the Medical Council of India, the ratio was one  doctor for a population of 2,000 resulting in unemployment among  doctors.    He also expressed concern at the circular issued by the  Maharashtra Government to allow qualified homoeopaths and  ayurvedic physicians to practice modern medicine. It was also  announced that the IMA had stalled, by moving the High Court,  the decision of the West Bengal Government to allow  diploma-holders in community medical service (a  three-year-course which was stopped after training three  batches) to prescribe modern medicine.    Dr. K.M. Moideenkutty, chairman, organising committee of the  conference, welcomed. Dr. V.C. Velayudhan Pillai, the outgoing  president, presided. A souvenir and a book, "Kumud Sankar  Ray--the visionary," was released by the Mayor Mr. T.P. Dasan.  Dr. George V. John, State president of the IMA, Dr. D.B. Bisht  of the World Health Organisation (WHO), Dr. K. Mohan Kumar,  secretary of the conference committee, and Mr. B.V. Abdulla  Koya, MP, spoke.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Frane Plancic: "Ultimatum -- the First Step"] </F>   [Text] The NATO ultimatum to the Bosnian Serbs, and thus  to Serbia too, is the first such act in the history of the  Western military Alliance, and the first that extends beyond the  range of its responsibility. In that it has a historical  importance, politically unsurpassed in post-Cold-War Europe.    The military importance of the ultimatum, however, is much  clearer, especially as it has been presented in a relatively  precise way, so it seems that this component completely  determines the limits of political engagement, that is, that the  matter concerns a military ultimatum, a decisive threat saying  that the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina should end. This  interpretation of the ultimatum is based on the justified wishes  of the Croats and Muslims, but it is not contained in the text  of the ultimatum.    This is a fact, and we can expect some more ultimatums of  the  same content until the Croats (in Croatia and  Bosnia-Herzegovina) and the Muslims (in Bosnia-Herzegovina and  elsewhere) establish joint political, military, intellectual,  and all other fronts against the aggressor. Only that could be  the basis of a politically clearer and more substantial  ultimatum of the Western Alliance, and, what is more important,  of a clear account with Moscow.    These are only some of the reasons for the Croats and  Muslims  not to expect allied air strikes on Serb targets in  Bosnia-Herzegovina or Serbia too soon. It is quite certain that  this will not happen, because the Bosnian Serbs have decided to  withdraw, as was the case with the Serb rebels in Croatia, when  most of the Serbian troops withdrew from Croatia.    The artillery-missile troops of the Bosnian Serbs are  therefore withdrawing from the positions from which they have  been stifling Sarajevo, and it is to be expected that they will  not offer armed resistance to the opening of Tuzla airport and  the Muslim enclaves in the Drina River valley. Their military  adventures elsewhere in Bosnia-Herzegovina have thus been  significantly weakened, and so have those in Croatia. However,  the Serb offensive potential has not been disabled or destroyed,  which, intimately, each of us wishes, as do the countries  bordering with Serbia, as can be discerned from their Geneva  meeting regarding the balance of military power on the Balkans  and reducing them to an acceptable defense level.    Considering all this, we can conclude that the NATO  ultimatum  to the Bosnian Serbs is at the same time an indirect message to  the Serb rebels in Croatia and to the military-police regime  that is in power in Serbia.    The content of the message is that they should put a time  limit on their military actions on the territory of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, that they should limit the use of certain  kinds of weapons, and even limit the targets. Croatia received  a similar message in late 1992. It accepted it and started  creating the conditions for resolving the war by political  means. Serbia and the so-called Srpska republic should not be  expected to accept the NATO message-ultimatum from such prudent  positions. They will accept it simply because they must accept  it, and will observe it until they have to, and where they have  to.    This has been happening so far. During the past two years,  the Serb armed forces were limited by time, space, and means, by  which they were forced into a defensive, a strategic defense of  the conquered territories.    The first such limit was imposed on the sea front -- thanks  to the activities of the Croatian Navy and the naval forces of  the Western alliance. The strategy of Croatian defense and the  liberation of the occupied territories was thus simplified. The  significance of this at present is the inability of the Serb  policy of conquest to indirectly improve the position in  Bosnia-Herzegovina by threatening Croatia from the sea, that is,  the all of southern Croatian and Herzegovina.    The following such limit was imposed on the use of Serb air  forces. It was also imposed toward the end of the war against  Croatia, and supported during the war against Bosnia-Herzegovina  by ultimatums and patrols by the allied air forces. Thus, the  Serbian aggression against Bosnia-Herzegovina lost its second  important strategic support.    The third, most important strategic support of the  aggression  have been the land forces. Following the bad experience in  Croatia, where they attempted to fight the classical way, these  forces -- the only remaining ones -- could carry out the  strategy of conquest only using ways and means employed in  stifling Sarajevo or conquering the territory along the Drina  River.    The methods are familiar. They boil down to the expression  "genocidal cleansing of desired territory." This -- and the NATO  ultimatum does not mention it because it is not within its  jurisdiction -- displays all the weakness of the ultimatum-like  political position of the West toward Serbia.    The means are also familiar. They boil down to  artillery-missile strikes, taking dominant positions, and  destroying everything that is not Serb or that will not be  useful. This -- though it is within the NATO jurisdiction --  also does not comprise as much as the meaning of the word  "ultimatum" does. The truth is that it does relate to those  means also, but only on one or two territories and in certain  situations, and it leaves them in the hands of the aggressor,  failing to threaten the aggressor's strong negotiating position,  which is the worst thing.    The limits imposed through the ultimatum on the use of the  Serb armed forces -- primarily naval, then air forces, and now  also the ground forces -- introduces the new quality described  above into the war for Bosnia-Herzegovina; a gradual and  increasingly decisive pushing out of the Serb armed forces from  the conquered territories. The humanitarian "intervention" can  now only count on success. Their combination is, however, a sure  failure without political intervention, which will not occur  with the attitudes current in Russia and Greece. This is what  Serbia relies on, withdrawing and not having withdrawn for three  years.</p>

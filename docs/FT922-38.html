			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / Relief supplies land at Sarajevo as UN takes control of airport A FRENCH aircraft carrying relief supplies landed at Sarajevo airport yesterday, hours after United Nations forces took control of the runway. Serb irregular forces relinquished their hold on the airport after fierce international pressure, and were escorted to their barracks south-west of the besieged Bosnian capital by a 34-man UN force. After the withdrawal, the UN Security Council, meeting in New York, unanimously agreed to send 1,000 Canadian troops, on standby in the nearby former Yugoslav republic of Croatia, to secure the airport. The Security Council's decision, based on a recommendation from Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, could lead in the next few days to an airlift of humanitarian aid to the city's 300,000 starving inhabitants. Despite yesterday's developments, General Lewis MacKenzie, UN chief negotiator in Sarajevo, said full military control of the airport still had to be established. However, the French, who had stationed two air force Transall cargo carriers at the nearby Adriatic port of Split, decided to risk sending in the first relief flight. Western diplomats welcomed the news, but said the fighting around the city was unlikely to stop. Serb forces continued to keep a tight grip on Sarajevo, renewing their attacks on the city from surrounding hills. In Washington, the US State Department for the first time refused to rule out participation of US military personnel in any operation to bring relief supplies to Sarajevo. 'If the UN votes on a resolution to take all necessary measures to facilitate provision of humanitarian assistance to the people of Bosnia-Hercegovina, it would be an action that we would support,' said department spokeswoman Ms Margaret Tutwiler. The Canadian battalion, expected in Sarajevo over the next 36 hours, is equipped with 80 armoured personnel carriers. The troops will work with French airport technicians to demilitarise the airport and surrounding areas. Sixty UN observers and 30 UN police will monitor the withdrawal of Serb heavy artillery from the airport area and inspect incoming relief supplies for smuggled weapons. Robert Mauthner, diplomatic correspondent, in London writes: Foreign Office officials said any further troops needed to secure Sarajevo airport would also be supplied by the UN. There was no shortage of countries ready to contribute troops to a UN force, but under no circumstances would Britain contribute ground forces to a UN contingent likely to be involved in fighting.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 12 KYODO -- Japan should pursue a  breakthrough in the stalled trade "framework" talks with  Washington by focusing on "objective criteria," Yotaro  Kobayashi, chairman of the Japan-U.S. Business Council, said  Thursday [12 May]. "There is something that Japan can and  should do (on objective criteria)," Kobayashi told a luncheon  sponsored by the Foreign Correspondents' Club of Japan.    Kobayashi said objective criteria are concepts that Tokyo  and  Washington previously agreed to work on in their efforts to  establish a new bilateral trade framework.    It is not "a difficult task" to evaluate American access to  Japanese markets by using certain criteria that describe a "so-  called desired state" in certain trade sectors, said Kobayashi,  who is also chairman of Fuji Xerox Co.    Such criteria, first spelled out in a joint statement issued  after the July 1993 summit between then Prime Minister Kiichi  Miyazawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton, differ from "numerical  targets," which Tokyo has opposed as managed trade, Kobayashi  said.    "I am sure both governments can agree to the use of `desired  state.' It does not have to be stated in specific numbers or  market share figures, but it can be stated in mutually agreed  terms like visibly reducing the current account surplus,"  Kobayashi said.    If sales of certain U.S. products in Japan stay flat in the  future despite Tokyo's purchasing pledge, discussions to improve  the situation can then be held, he said.    The statement from the Miyazawa-Clinton summit indicated the  two countries will "assess the implementation of measures and  policies taken in each sectoral and structural area... [ellipses  as received] based upon sets of objective criteria, either  qualitative or quantitative or both as appropriate."    Kobayashi said the perception that the U.S. demands  numerical  targets is wrong. Clinton "clearly and unequivocally" stated  Washington does not want such targets, in a joint news  conference after meeting with then Japanese Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa in February, Kobayashi said.</p>

			<p><P> January 23, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ACCOUNTING  </P> <P> All the financial reporting in the news these days makes me wish I had gone  into show business. However, I chose accounting for my life's work because it  was so logical and made such good sense.  </P> <P> I clearly remember, in 1946, my tough professor at Woodbury College (now  University) stressing never to anticipate any income but always to provide for  all expense.  </P> <P> Now, accounting gimmicks and legerdemain are used to mask the federal deficit,  make junk bonds look good, mislead investors in savings and loans and a myriad  of other financial matters. It appears there is as much fiction in the business  section of the paper as there is in the entertainment section.  </P> <P> Looking back, I wonder how I might have done writing novels and screenplays. I  think I could have been a contender.  </P> <P> CLIFFORD W. SCOTT  </P> <P> Bear Valley Springs  </P></p>

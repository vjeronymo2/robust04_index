			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / M&amp;G shake-up signals more aggressive sales approach M&amp;G, Britain's largest independent unit trust company, has replaced its marketing director in a move that signals a shift towards a more aggressive sales approach and a greater emphasis on products other than unit trusts. Mr Tim Miller, who was also a main board member at M&amp;G, will leave the company. He will be succeeded by Mr Peter Emms, formerly executive director of marketing at Allied Dunbar, a life insurer which relies heavily on commission-only agents and is known for an aggressive sales approach. M&amp;G, which has always sold its products only through independent financial advisers or by direct advertising, is now considering the establishment of a small direct sales force, according to Mr Paddy Linaker, chief executive. 'We are not going to convert ourselves into an Allied Dunbar of hard-headed salesmen,' Mr Linaker said, adding that to do so would risk tarnishing the company's image. 'Commission-only sales agents do not fit into the M&amp;G ethos.' However, M&amp;G was concerned that failure to build a direct sales force could eventually cause it to lose market share. It also plans to improve services to the independent broker network which accounts for two-thirds of unit trust sales and almost all life and pensions sales. Mr Miller's removal coincides with M&amp;G's decision to concentrate on sales of life insurance and pensions. These products have seen rising demand while M&amp;G experienced a net outflow of unit trust business in the first half of this year. M&amp;G's sales approach has contrasted with that of Allied Dunbar and other commission-only insurance companies. Eschewing a hard-sell approach, it has preferred to capitalise on brand-name recognition. The move is indicative of growing concern over the ability of independent brokers to maintain their market share. Figures from the Unit Trust Association showed that in the first half of 1992, clients of independent advisers had sold Pounds 120m more of unit trusts than they had bought. By contrast, direct sales forces achieved a net inflow of Pounds 190m. Mr Linaker said the board wanted to combine responsibility for oversight of the independent financial adviser network with marketing and sales, noting that Mr Miller had not directly overseen the brokerage network. Mr Miller, who joined M&amp;G in 1988, said he was 'baffled' at the move to replace him.</p>

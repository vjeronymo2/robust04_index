			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Stanhope's future hangs in the balance The future of Stanhope hung in the balance last night after a meeting of banks owed Pounds 140m broke up without a decision on whether to accept proposed rescue offers or put the troubled property developer into receivership. The meeting of 16 banks led by Barclays did not extend the company's existing borrowing facility beyond next Monday. The lending syndicate must therefore decide on a course of action within the next few days.</p>

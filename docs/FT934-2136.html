			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Exports behind 24% advance at Halma A strong export performance helped Halma, the safety and environmental technology group, increase pre-tax profits by 24 per cent to Pounds 10.1m in the six months to October 2. Turnover rose by 22 per cent to Pounds 61.9m. Direct exports increased by 34 per cent to Pounds 18m and overseas sales by 37 per cent to Pounds 33.7m. Mr David Barber, chairman, said overseas sales now comprised 54 per cent of group sales, the highest proportion ever. The chairman said he was delighted with the results, which had been achieved even though the group's markets in the UK and in the EU remained relatively depressed throughout the period. Despite this, many of the companies had produced very satisfactory results with outstanding performances recorded by Apollo Fire Detectors and by Memco, which makes electronic sensors for elevator doors. The American division also reported excellent results. Mr Barber said: 'The group can look forward to continuing growth and the second half should provide further evidence of this.' Earnings per share rose 21 per cent to 3.43p (2.83p) and the interim dividend is lifted to 0.933p (0.777p).</p>

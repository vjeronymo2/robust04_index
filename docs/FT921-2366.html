			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Election 1992 (The Manifestos): Labour maps route for long march - The party has played it safe with a pragmatic, upbeat manifesto A DETAILED route map for the long march out of recession is the stolid impression it seeks to convey. But the real message of Labour's manifesto is in the mood-music. A world away from 1983's 'longest suicide note in history' or even the democratic socialism of 1987, the latest manifestation of the party's evolution eschews even token gestures to the old Labourism. Socialism is not mentioned once. Instead, the paper addresses the universal fears of apolitical middle England  - unemployment, illness, poor schools and crime  - and tries to provide a prescription to eradicate them. It is hardly surprising. This close to power, Mr Kinnock and his team are understandably reluctant to risk giving offence to anyone. In consequence, the 28-page document adds little to the softly, softly revisionism of the three policy documents it supersedes. Some traditional Labour melodies haunt the pages. There is an echo of Harold Wilson's 'white heat of technology' in the stress on science and innovation. And even, from time to time, something to remind the reader of the no-nonsense certainties of Attlee's nanny state. But the watchword is caution. 'We are the good managers now,' is the theme. The party leader's foreword gives the explanation. In words that could have been lifted from Mr Roy Hattersley's treatise, Choose Freedom, Mr Kinnock states that 'individual liberty' is Labour's core conviction. But he adds: 'For liberty to have real meaning the standards of community provision must be high and access to that provision must be wide.' Upon this premise, the 10,000-word manifesto is built. In the economic section, Labour stresses that it will be 'a government which business can do business with'. The European case for limited intervention follows. 'Modern government has a strategic role, not to replace the market but to ensure that the market works properly . . . it is the government's responsibility to create the conditions for enterprise to thrive.' When it comes to tax  - not least the new 50 per cent band and the removal of the ceiling on National Insurance contributions  - the manifesto argues simply that the moves are both self-financing and fair. The document moves rapidly on to discuss its approach to industry. Enhanced capital allowances and 25 per cent tax credits for innovation are stressed as evidence of Labour's conviction that 'Britain's future must be high skill, high wage and high tech'. The tripartite spirit also comes through in the section on training and the unions. 'Training,' it insists, 'will be a real partnership between government and industry, not an excuse to shift all the burden on to employers.' On the unions, too, there are reassuring words for the bosses. A fair framework of law for 'both employers and unions' will not herald a return to to the legislation of the 1970s, the manifesto insists. How convincing is this new-found 'One Nation' Labourism? The answer, perhaps, is in the sheer conservatism of the manifesto's treatment of health and education. The document borrows heavily from the Tories' moves towards quality controls and consumer power, while harking back to 'pure' public service untainted by market forces. It is in the omissions and adjustments from Labour's 1987 agenda that the greatest changes have come. But the party's snail-like progress to the political centre has been so lengthy, and so laboriously reported, that it is easy to forget how far it has come. On Europe, for example, Labour has long played more communautaire than thou to the Tory sceptics. But not a word is said of the single currency. With the kind of care Mr Major might apply, it merely states: 'We shall play an active part in negotiations on Economic and Monetary Union.' Nuclear weapons  - to be unilaterally discarded under the 1987 manifesto  - are now a passing paragraph. The clear hint that a Labour government would retain them indefinitely is mitigated only by a commitment not to deploy more warheads than those already in service. The burgeoning wing of Labour constitutional reformers will be disappointed with the wording that they find. Buried towards the back of the book, the programme for 'A Modern Democracy' is nonetheless a touchstone of the new radicalism. Mr Kinnock's fingerprints are all over the manifesto's final draft. The Scottish parliament and a Freedom of Information Bill within a first session are still there. But past hints at English regional administrations within a first parliament have gone. Reform of the House of Lords and electoral reform for the Commons  - the goals of the fastest-growing lobby group within the party  - are mentioned only in a timeframe that might stretch to the millennium and beyond. If the manifesto hides hostages to fortune, conservative Mr Kinnock has done his best to avoid them.</p>

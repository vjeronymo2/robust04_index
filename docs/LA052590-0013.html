			<p><P> May 25, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> PLAN TO WATER MADRONA MARSH ON HOLD;  </P> <P> TORRANCE: OPPOSITION BY COUNCILMAN HAS HALTED USE OF CITY DRINKING WATER TO  REPLENISH AN ECOSYSTEM RAVAGED BY DROUGHT.  </P> <P> The wetlands of Madrona Marsh haven't been very wet for about four years now.  </P> <P> Green thickets of tule grass have withered into tangled, gray stands of dead  stems. Aquatic marsh plants have given way to carpets of common weeds. Nesting  waterfowl, once a common sight, have flown elsewhere to raise their young.  </P> <P> The four-year California drought has meant a creeping disappearance for Madrona  Marsh. Each year, fewer acres of the vernal marsh experience the  life-sustaining winter floods that carry the delicate ecosystem through the  drier months.  </P> <P> On Earth Day, retired contractor Don Roser set foot in Madrona for the first  time and saw its shriveled condition.  </P> <P> He decided that his personal environmental project would be to get Madrona a  nice, long drink of water.  </P> <P> After Roser did some vigorous lobbying at City Hall, the marsh got its first  good sip on Wednesday night. But Roser faces a battle before the City Council  next week to get the marsh the rest of the water it needs.  </P> <P> Plans by Torrance park administrators to release between two and four acre-feet  of domestic drinking water into the marsh -- an amount roughly equal to between  650,000 and 1.3 million gallons -- have been blocked by City Councilman Dan  Walker, who says he believes pouring city drinking water into a marsh during a  drought sets a bad conservation example.  </P> <P> Gene Barnett, Torrance parks and recreation director, said Madrona's water  needs represent less than a fraction of 1% of his department's overall water  use. Although city departments earlier this year agreed to cut their water  consumption by 10%, Barnett made plans to supply water to Madrona by simply  cutting back a little more than 10% at each of the city's parks.  </P> <P> Several of Walker's council colleagues argue that watering the marsh is a  perfectly rational thing to do.  </P> <P> "The reason for the city gaining title to that land was so that we could  preserve the marsh as a natural habitat," Mayor Katy Geissert said. "Because of  the drought situation and because of the development all around there, there  has been virtually no natural runoff. . . . This is important to retain the  viability of the marsh."  </P> <P> The city gained title to Madrona Marsh in 1986 after a protracted battle over  proposed construction there. Eventually, the developer of Park Del Amo won the  right to build 1,482 residential units and 850,000 square feet of office space  in exchange for donating 34.5 acres of marshland and selling an additional 8.5  acres to the city.  </P> <P> Councilman Tim Mock said he sees the latest issue as balancing the use of one  valuable resource -- water -- to save another.  </P> <P> "The council already has determined that the marsh is a valuable resource," he  said. "We spent a lot of time and effort to preserve the marshland, and this is  just following through with that effort."  </P> <P> But Walker said he believes that Madrona would be fine without a drop.  </P> <P> "The marsh can survive on its own. It has gone through periods of drought and  periods of flood, and it will again," he said. "It just isn't right to use our  drinking water to fill a marsh."  </P> <P> On Wednesday afternoon, as city workers prepared to test the water valves that  could quench Madrona's thirst, Walker called Barnett and told him what he  thought of the plan.  </P> <P> In response, Barnett briefly put the marsh watering plans on hold while he  conferred with City Manager LeRoy Jackson.  </P> <P> At 7 p.m. Wednesday, Jackson gave the go-ahead and city workers opened valves  around the marsh, allowing roughly 200,000 gallons of water to flow in. At the  request of the Metropolitan Water District, the water was pumped at night to  prevent rapid evaporation.  </P> <P> City plans called for starting the pumps once or twice more over several days  to give the marsh at least 500,000 gallons more.  </P> <P> But on Thursday morning, Walker demanded that the issue be placed on the  council's May 29 agenda. Jackson said no more water will be pumped until the  council discusses the matter.  </P> <P> Roser, 62, said he never dreamed that he would have to wade through such a  political morass.  </P> <P> "I just wanted to give the marsh a little help," Roser said. "I told (the city)  from the start that I'd be willing to pay for it, if that was the problem."  </P> <P> Recently retired from his general contracting business, Roser said his water  odyssey began when he took an Earth Day tour of Madrona Marsh last month.  </P> <P> "I came to the realization that it was drying up and it needed some help,"  Roser said.  </P> <P> After confirming his suspicions with City Naturalist Walton Wright, who acts as  the marsh's caretaker, Roser started lobbying city officials and won financial  support from a nonprofit group called Friends of Madrona Marsh.  </P> <P> City officials said they already were working on a water management plan for  the marsh, which included installation of a pump to carry water into the marsh  from a drainage sump on the corner of Sepulveda Boulevard and Maple Avenue.  </P> <P> But before the lines to the marsh were installed, this season's only major  storm dumped nearly 700,000 gallons of water into the sump, where existing  pumps sent it out to sea.  </P> <P> Officials had just begun talking about replacing the lost sump water with  domestic supplies when Roser stepped in.  </P> <P> "We were caught between two stewardships," City Manager Jackson said. "We had  to ask, did we disturb the natural balance of water in the marsh? Yes, we did.  . . . Can we repair that without doing harm to our overall conservation  program? The answer is yes.  </P> <P> "With those things in mind, I think we were correct in moving forward."  </P> <P> Walking through the marsh Wednesday afternoon, Wright said the water is central  to Madrona's long-term health.  </P> <P> Once part of a 665-acre drainage basin, the 43-acre preserve that remains needs  water funneled to it -- either from sumps or some other source -- to thrive, he  said.  </P> <P> Although far from dead now, Madrona's wetlands have shrunk to such an extent  that the birds that used to call it home during the winter have had a difficult  time surviving there, Wright said.  </P> <P> Foxes living in Madrona's dry areas have eaten duck and coot eggs that normally  would have been hidden deep inside a broad wetland. Those ducklings that did  manage to hatch did not have enough water around them to protect them from the  foxes. All were eaten, he said.  </P> <P> Last week, a pair of mallard ducks and their seven ducklings were found  waddling through a carwash parking lot across from Madrona. Humane Society  workers captured them, then asked Wright what to do.  </P> <P> Concerned that without enough water they would fall prey to Madrona's foxes, he  told the workers to take the ducks either to the South Coast Botanic Garden on  the Palos Verdes Peninsula or to Machado Lake in Harbor City.  </P> <P> "I wasn't looking for a cause," Roser said, "but come on -- they're even  turning the birds away. It ought to be as sacred as apple pie to keep something  like this alive."  </P></p>

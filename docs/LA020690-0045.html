			<p><P> February 6, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART BUCHWALD: IT'S SIMPLY A MATTER OF GETTING THE FAX  </P> <P> The most important new word in the English language is "fax." It is a method of  sending paper by telephone. For example, if I want to shoot you a clipping from  this newspaper, I put it into my fax machine and it is transmitted to your fax  machine in seconds.  </P> <P> Because the United States shuffles more paper than any other country on the  planet, the fax machine has changed the way we deal with problems.  </P> <P> This is all you hear in offices these days: "Will you fax me that report? . . .  I'll fax you my objections and then you fax everything to the client in San  Francisco."  </P> <P> The trouble with faxing papers is that people judge how hard you are working by  the amount of faxing you do. In most offices, those who only fax every hour are  thought to be less productive than those who fax every 15 minutes. John  O'Connor is one of the great faxers of Washington. He has a fax in the office,  one at home and one in his car. During his lunch hour he thinks nothing of  faxing the U.S. budget to a friend in Singapore.  </P> <P> "You were an early faxer before it became popular. Does it discourage you that  everybody is doing it now?" I asked him.  </P> <P> "The more the merrier," he replied. "Don't forget, it takes two to fax. Excuse  me, I have to fax an anniversary card to my wife."  </P> <P> "Does she mind getting her anniversary greetings by fax machine?"  </P> <P> "Why should she? It's on her desk right away."  </P> <P> "Is there a knack to faxing?"  </P> <P> "Like everything else, there are good faxers and bad ones. A good faxer knows  exactly how to insert the paper so that the print comes out nice and clean at  the other end. Some people are born faxers -- lawyers, for example. They can  service two clients on two different telephone lines at the same time, and  charge them both the full fee. Doctors are starting to fax throat cultures to  each other, and people are even sending love letters on the machine."  </P> <P> "Why?"  </P> <P> "When you're in love you want the whole Bell system to know it."  </P> <P> "Do some people in your office fax more than others?"  </P> <P> "Damn right they do, and it's costing us a bundle. There is a guy here who  faxes all the baseball scores to his bookie in Las Vegas. We have a woman who  transmits Ann Landers' column to everyone in her aerobics class. We're looking  at an electronic revolution that will change our lives. Today we're faxing  paper -- someday we could be faxing people."  </P> <P> "You mean we'll be sending people by telephone?"  </P> <P> "It's well within the realm of possibility. The world is getting smaller thanks  to the fax machine. First we communicated by Morse code, then by voice and now  paper. Tomorrow we may place our kids in fax machines and send them to camp."  </P> <P> All the time O'Connor was talking to me he was inserting memoranda into one  machine and ripping off messages from the other one.  </P> <P> "The trick," he said, "is to fax more outgoing material than you take in."  </P> <P> "How do you do that?" I wanted to know.  </P> <P> "Fax everybody. My greatest moment as a faxer was when I sent an entire  manuscript to a publisher I had never met. I tied up his line for nine hours  because there was no way he could turn his machine off."  </P></p>

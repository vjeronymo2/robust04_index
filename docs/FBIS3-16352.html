A Bankrupt Meets Bankers"]    [Text] Yesterday, Mr. Zhirinovskiy, who had attempted  during his spectacular election campaign to pay with false  pay-sheets and "slush-fund cash" for the air time accorded to  him, tried to persuade Russian bankers at his faction's meeting  to finance his future election campaign (or maybe also his  previous one in view of his obvious bankruptcy).    Representatives of 80 banks were invited to attend the  meeting together with members of the Russian and Moscow  governments, revenue services, and so forth. According to  SEGODNYA's information, neither the top chiefs nor  representatives of any reputable banks were seen at the meeting.  A large number of Russian and particularly foreign journalists  were present as usual. Generally speaking, as practice has  shown, Zhirinovskiy is much better consumed on the foreign  market than on the domestic one.    The Liberal Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR] could not  please the bankers with its traditional buffoonery at the  meeting: When you ask for money, you have to behave  appropriately. Zhirinovskiy simply said that banks should help  the LDPR because it is precisely this party that guarantees  stability in the country. "I want to give a signal from our  party so that you could correctly assess the situation and help  us financially." LDPR representatives explained that they are  not fascists but simple patriots, and that they will prevent the  fascists from coming to power.    It turned out that the LDPR stands for the Chinese model, a  stance evidently meant to give Zhirinovskiy a certain air of  respectability a la Mr. Volskiy.    Getting down to business, Zhirinovskiy told the audience  that  a total of 22 trillion rubles [R] is sitting idly in Russian  banks. He did not ask "to give him all the profits," he just  suggested that they share with him 1 percent of the amount.  That is, the bankrupt lays claim to a meager R220 billion.    During the meeting, LDPR members wondered about the behavior  by chiefs of GMM [a foreign bank implicated in possible LDPR  election misconduct], who, in their view, "do not realize their  own advantage" as they stubbornly deny that they had financed  Zhirinovskiy. LDPR speakers said that the company's ability to  finance "the most stable party" should have been its best  advertisement.    As a matter of fact, earlier Zhirinovskiy had time to meet  with Richard Nixon, former U.S. president, behind closed doors  at the Balchug-Kempinsky hotel, where the American guest is  staying. Zhirinovskiy conveyed through Mr. Nixon his message to  the incumbent U.S. President and his autographed two books. Let  us hope that the former president is wise enough not to hand  this trash over to Mr. Clinton.    To all appearances, Zhirinovskiy will get no serious money  from mentally sound bankers. Evidently, the claimant himself  has also realized that. Upon ending the meeting, he told the  journalists that 21 September of last year may recur one of  these days. "All characteristics are present, symptoms are  evident; papers, documents are ready, troops have long been  brought in for street clashes." Evidently, a difficult time has  set in for Zhirinovskiy's party. The only thing that could save  it is yet more bloody turmoil that the Nazi leader is trying his  best to foment.</p>

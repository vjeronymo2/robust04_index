			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Hurd wins backing for Bosnia blockade CONSERVATIVE MPs showed signs last night of rallying around a government policy on Bosnia of toughening sanctions against Serbia and rejecting for now - but not ruling out - an escalation of military action. Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, won support among Tories for his pledge to ensure the tightest possible enforcement of sanctions agreed by the UN on Saturday. 'We are looking to turn sanctions into a blockade,' he said. But he again faced calls from Labour for 'punitive' air strikes against Serb supply and communication lines if the peace plan of UN negotiators Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen was not accepted. Some Labour left-wingers urged a more forceful intervention. Among Tory MPs, however, widespread fears about Britain being dragged into an escalating conflict surfaced during Mr Hurd's statement. Sir Edward Heath, the former prime minister, last night flatly rejected calls from Lady Thatcher, his successor in 10 Downing Street, for western military intervention. Sir Edward, speaking after Mr Hurd's statement, said that the West had no hope of settling the war by military means. Instead it should concentrate its efforts on improving the supply of humanitarian aid. Earlier in the Commons Mr Michael Ancram, Conservative MP for Devizes, said positive military action might produce short-term results but could 'threaten a wide and bloodier civil war'. Mr Nicholas Budgen, Tory MP for Wolverhampton South West, asked: 'What is the British national interest in Bosnia?' He said the government needed to explain what differentiated 'the horrible war in Bosnia from the many equally horrible wars which are occuring in other parts of the world'. Mr Michael Colvin, Tory MP for Romsey and Waterside, said the Serbs had enough weapons to last two years and backed strongly the imposition of a blockade. 'The umbilical cord between Moscow and Belgrade must be cut,' he added. For Labour, Mr Jack Cunningham, the shadow foreign secretary, said the government had admited existing sanctions against Serbia had not been properly enforced. He said it was time the Serbs were given an ultimatum backed by the threat of air strikes.</p>

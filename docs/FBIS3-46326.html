Qian made clear at the banquet that the maintenance of Sino-  French friendly relations of cooperation is not only in the  basic interest of the two peoples, but also beneficial to world  peace, stability and economic development.    Qian said that 30 years ago, Chairman Mao Zedong and Charles  de Gaulle made the historic decision for the establishment of  Sino- French diplomatic relations with the foresight and  sagacity of great statesmanship, despite all obstacles.    While reviewing the development of Sino-French relations  today, he added, we feel stronger that the decision made by  leaders of both countries at that time was right and fitting  with historical trends.    Qian noted that the agreement reached between the two  governments not long ago has turned a new page on Sino-French  relations.    Qian pointed out that China and France, sharing the same or  similar views on many important international issues, should  strengthen consultations and coordination.    He said that China attaches great importance as always to  relations with France, holding that Sino-French relations should  have an eye not only on the present, but also on the next  century.    He added that the long maintenance of stable Sino-French  friendly relations of cooperation is a factor for world peace  and balance.    Qian noted that China and France share strong economic  complementarity, which embodies a vast potential for bilateral  economic and trade cooperation, in hopes that more French  enterprises and corporations come to China to invest and conduct  business.    He said that Chinese leaders are hoping for French Prime  Minister Edouard Balladur to visit China, voicing that the  visit, an important event in bilateral relations, will further  accelerate and promote an overall restoration and development of  Sino-French relations.    Peyrefitte and his party arrived here this morning to  participate in commemorative activities for the 30th anniversary  of the establishment of Sino-French diplomatic relations and to  make preparations for Balladur's visit to China.    At the banquet, Peyrefitte said that shadows over bilateral  relations in the past few years have been cleared now, so both  France and China are ready to hold grand memorial activities to  mark the anniversary.    He continued that during the past 30 years, the world, China  and France have all experienced changes, but China and France  are not the same as other countries for France is the sole  oldest country in the Western world and China is the sole oldest  country in Asia, and both countries have their experiences and  influence, which cannot be measured by population and gross  national product.    He said that since 1978 when China started its drive toward  modernization, reform and opening up, its efforts have resulted  in a surprising and sustained economic growth, which has won  China many friends.    He pointed out that, as old friends, France and China have  become frank friends again after removing misunderstandings  today.    Peyrefitte at last quoted a Chinese saying, with a wish for  Sino- French friendship to "last forever".    French Senator and Admiral Philippe de Gaulle also made a  speech at the banquet, saying that the decision made by his  father, former President Charles de Gaulle, in 1964 to establish  diplomatic relations with China was a symbol of an independent  foreign policy followed by a sovereign France.    The concept of national independence is the one most  remarkable common point shared by the two peoples, he added.    He continued that, compared with 1964, today's China, a big  country in politics and culture and an economic giant  accelerating its construction as set out by Mr. Deng Xiaoping,  occupies a more prominent position in history and cultivation.    He voiced that both countries have more reasons than in 1964  to maintain and develop friendly relations set up in the past.    Present at the banquet were Power Industry Minister Shi  Dazhen, Posts and Telecommunications Minister Wu Jichuan and  French Ambassador to China Francois Plaisant.    Before the banquet, Qian met with Peyrefitte and his party,  praising Peyrefitte for his efforts in pushing forward the  development of Sino-French relations and enhancing understanding  and friendship between the two peoples during the past 30 years.    He noted that Sino-French relations have played a  constructive, stable and balancing role in the world during the  past 30 years, whose importance has exceeded bilateral relations  and should be exercised even more in the current new world  situation.    Qian pointed out that history will prove the rightness of  the  decision on normalization of Sino-French relations made by Prime  Minister Balladur.    He welcomed French enterprises to take part in equal  competition on the Chinese market, saying that China is  witnessing a high economic growth rate.    Peyrefitte said that Balladur has pushed bilateral relations  back onto a normal track, hoping his visit to China would be  fruitful.    This afternoon, Vice-Foreign Minister Tian Zengpei held  talks  with Peyrefitte.</p>

			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / Shift in EC funds urged PRIORITIES in disbursing EC structural funds in Ireland need to be changed significantly, says a a report published yesterday by the Dublin-based Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI). The report, commissioned by the Irish government's Department of Finance, recommends more resources be directed at training early school-leavers and the long-term unemployed. It says the emphasis of rural development funds should be shifted from extensive grazing to forestry and industrial policy should give greater emphasis to supporting medium-sized Irish-owned companies than to foreign investment. The recommendations are likely to have a significant influence on the government, and on EC budget controllers, as the former draws up its spending plans for an estimated IPounds 8bn (Dollars 12bn) that is expected to be available to Ireland in EC structural and cohesion funds between now and the end of the decade. The report notes that the inflow of EC structural funds to Ireland over the past two years was equivalent to 3.5 per cent of GNP.</p>

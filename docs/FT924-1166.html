			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / Letter: Better for British Gas shareholders to spin out transportation Sir, In the light of the strong views put forward by Ofgas on the structure of British Gas in the UK, I would like to add my views as a big user of the services provided by British Gas's transportation arm. Agas was the first company to be formed in the newly competitive industrial and commercial gas market in 1987. It needed direction from Ofgas for us to secure transportation rights from British Gas in 1988 but since 1990 we have found a developing spirit of co-operation with them. We have previously argued that a separate transportation operation within British Gas was all that was needed to help develop the services to all the new entrants in this rapidly developing market. Now, however, with several more years' experience we believe that it is in the interests of British Gas shareholders, the users of the system, and gas consumers to have a completely new and independent company running the business. Our reasons are as follows: British Gas shareholders will unlock value through a separation because the share price is currently being held back by the integrated nature of the business, the frequent public disputes with Ofgas, and the recurrence of government and quasi-government reviews. All users of the transportation and storage system, including the marketing arm of British Gas, will be treated equally and this will be demonstrable. A range of commercial services - eg, timely meter reading, flexible portfolio management facilities - will be likely to be developed in a company in which the solo business focus is on services. This will give customers greater flexibility and maximise the value of the asset to its owners. Transparency of asset values, costs and returns to shareholders will be available which will remove the antagonism created by the current lack of information available in this area and remove any suspicions of cross-subsidy from the rate of return argument. Customers will benefit through lower prices as a result of the more efficient management of the system and the provision of a wider range of services.

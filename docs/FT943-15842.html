			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / Book Review: Life with the bear's necessities DAMAGE LIMITATION OR CRISIS? Russia and the Outside World Edited by Robert D Blackwill and Sergei A Karaganov Brasseys, Dollars 18.50, 352 pages Amid the steady stream of books on the former Soviet Union, this one is rare. It is concerned with a present, rather than a past, debate. Its subject is one which consumes foreign offices worldwide: what place will the states of the former Soviet Union, above all Russia, find for themselves in the world? And, whatever that place is, will they find it peacefully? Russia's actions are often seen, in the west, through the recently acquired filter of 'neo imperialism'. This has been our over-correction to what was on the Russian part an over-accommodation of western foreign policy goals and strategies in the 12 to 18 months immediately after the August 1991 coup and the collapse of the Soviet Union. It was a period which Sergei Karaganov, deputy director of the Institute of Europe in Moscow and co-editor of this book, calls 'the time of Mister Yes'. The first signs that Russia's accommodation of the west could not be sustained came in 1992, when President Boris Yeltsin abruptly cancelled a visit to Tokyo because of pressure from increasingly powerful nationalist politicians who thought he would return to the Japanese some or all four of the Kurile Islands, which the Soviet Union seized after the second world war. By late 1993, Russia's leadership was obviously groping for an independent position. A military doctrine was approved which legitimised intervention in the 'near abroad' (former Soviet states) and allowed for a first nuclear strike. The world was told that Russia could no longer 'say yes' when the nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky began his extraordinary run in the December 1993 parliamentary elections. Both President Yeltsin and Andrei Kozyrev, foreign minister, made watershed speeches. Early this year, Yeltsin said that emphasis would be placed on 'the defence of Russia's national interests, of the rights of the Russian and Russian-speaking populations within the guidelines of international law and proceeding from the idea of all-national solidarity'. These were phrases which, in their vagueness, were the more threatening. Kozyrev, claiming that the 'main threats' to Russia came from the near abroad, told senior Russian diplomats: 'I think that raising the question about complete withdrawal and removal of any Russian military presence from the countries of the near abroad is just an extreme, if not extremist, suggestion'. These remarks, as reported by the official news service, could have applied to troops in the Baltics, which Russia had pledged to withdraw - but the interpretation was denied. It is easy to show that these words have been fleshed out with actions and thus used to construct a neo-imperialist scenario: Russian intervention in Moldova, Georgia, the Armenian-Azeri conflict, Tajikistan; threats to Estonia, Latvia and Ukraine (over Crimea); claims to primacy in all things among members of the Commonwealth of Independent States. The Russian bear would seem again aroused, sharp-clawed and snarling. However, the basic message of the book - there are many disagreements within it - is that this is not yet the case. It could, however, become so, especially if the west assumed imperialist designs and reacted accordingly. Russia will have to dominate the 'near abroad' but, argue most Russian contributors, this is not imperialism because it is forced on her. Says Karaganov: 'Russia must choose between (1) partial reintegration of parts of the former Soviet Union in a confederative-like structure, along with management of instability in the rest of the former Soviet states; and (2) the creation of a system of dependent and dominated states with only formal independence, along the model of US relations with central American states. The second choice is bad but preferable to the first. This decision will face Moscow whoever is in power.' Igor Klyamkin, a Russian historian whose essay on democracy in Russia is one of the best things in a good book, argues that the west should recognise Russia as the hegemonic regional power in exchange for its commitments to democratic development. Andrei Kortunov, head of foreign policy at Moscow's Institute of USA and Canadian Studies, observes accurately that 'off the record, (US) State Department officials often talk in favour of a Russian sphere of influence in Eurasia. But the toughening Russian policy towards the former republics will force the White House to distance itself from the Kremlin's political and military claims at least at the level of rhetoric . . . The former Soviet republics might need resolute and firm western leadership more than ever before, but the west is less prepared than ever to provide this leadership.' The Kremlin appears to have imbibed this message. We can thus expect a Russian policy moderated by considerations of the western response only insofar as that response touches vital Russian interests; and there is disagreement in Moscow over how vital financial aid is considered to be. Robert Blackwill, a Harvard academic and former diplomat, warns of the need to 'get ready for a crisis generated by Ukrainian fragmentation'. But the west - as Kortunov notes - does not want to be bothered with this. The problem will thus, by default, be left to the Russians, who, since they favour integration, will face opposition, possibly armed, from Ukrainian nationalists. 'Historians,' conclude Blackwill and Karaganov, 'are unlikely to be kind to western and Russian leaders who failed to take advantage of the extraordinary opportunity that presented itself in the period immediately following the Soviet collapse.' Damage Limitation or Crisis? leaves little doubt that the main authors believe that this failure is well along the road. If so, we are indeed in for trouble.</p>

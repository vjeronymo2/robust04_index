			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Bowater disappoints in spite of rise to Pounds 212m Bowater, the packaging, printing and coated products group, yesterday claimed success for its 'bold' acquisitions strategy as it revealed a 44 per cent increase in full-year pre-tax profits from Pounds 147m to Pounds 212m. However, the group's shares, after an initial 10p surge, reacted badly, closing down 39p at 453p. Analysts said the good results had been expected and already discounted in the share price, and the market was disappointed by a cautious statement from Bowater. The group said market conditions, especially in continental Europe, continued to be difficult, and a move to shorter order books and smaller orders had accelerated. Raw materials prices were also said to be rising, prompting concerns about margin pressure. But Mr David Lyon, chief executive, said demand showed some signs of improvement. 'Demand was down in the third quarter of last year, but came back in the fourth. Overall it's a little better.' The profit, at the top end of expectations, included an exceptional gain of Pounds 10.3m on business disposals, plus a Pounds 7m gain on foreign exchange translations Mr Lyon said last year's acquisitions, totalling Pounds 403m, of Specialty Coatings International, the US coatings company, medical packaging company Tower, and MiTek, the connector plate manufacturer, had been integrated quickly and outperformed expectations. An important task now was to exploit the links between different parts of the business to develop 'value-added' products and ensure the group could offer integrated solutions to customers' needs. Group turnover for the year to December 31 increased from Pounds 1.57bn to Pounds 2.14bn, including Pounds 318m from acquisitions. Operating profits rose from Pounds 141m to Pounds 194m, with a Pounds 38m contribution from the acquisitions. Operating profits in the UK and Ireland increased from Pounds 69.5m to Pounds 74.5m, in the Americas from Pounds 39.2m to Pounds 80.7m, and in Australasia from Pounds 13.9m to Pounds 22.8m. Profits in continental Europe fell from Pounds 16.4m to Pounds 14m. Operating margins increased from 9 to 9.1 per cent. A Pounds 61m cash inflow from operations, before acquisitions and rights issues, helped reduce debt from Pounds 276m to Pounds 262m. Gearing fell from 56 per cent to 40 per cent. Bowater is proposing a final dividend of 7.25p, lifting the total from 11.1p to 12.55p. Earnings increased from 24.4p to 28.2p a share.</p>

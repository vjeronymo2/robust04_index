			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / Survey on Taiwan (3): Standing at the crossroads - Angus Foster investigates rising pressures in a showcase economy TAIWAN'S showcase economy, which generated annual growth of 8 per cent through the 1980s, is at the crossroads. On the surface, all appears well. Growth is forecast to hit 7 per cent this year, after 7.3 per cent in 1991. Unemployment is below 2 per cent and consumer price inflation, although edging upwards, will probably average below 4 per cent for the year. But declining competitiveness among Taiwan's low cost manufacturers, who since the late 1980s have faced rising costs and an appreciating New Taiwanese dollar, is forcing them to upgrade or move overseas to other, cheaper Asian locations such as Indonesia and, increasingly, China. Meanwhile, a maturing economy is adding new pressures such as a declining savings rate, down 10 per cent to 29.5 per cent in five years, and rising consumer spending. Taiwan has overcome such hurdles before. With the largest central bank foreign exchange reserves in the world, more than USDollars 88bn, the island can also afford to increase government spending and guarantee growth while the economy restructures. Nevertheless, new pressures and new costs associated with moves towards democracy, such as tighter environmental regulations, suggest growth in the 1990s will be slower and more erratic than in the past decade. Growth this year is being driven by consumer and government spending. Consumer spending has risen since 1987 helped by annual average wage increases of 10 per cent overall and up to 15 per cent in the service sector. Growing affluence has lifted demand for foreign consumer goods, which now account for more than 10 per cent of total imports for the first time. The government's six-year, USDollars 303bn National Development infrastructure plan is now under way and government spending is forecast to rise 20 per cent this year, compared to private sector investment growth of 5-6 per cent. The government's share of gross fixed capital formation is forecast to reach 30 per cent this year, compared to 17 per cent in 1987. To help finance the plan, the government ran a budget deficit of USDollars 10bn last year, the first time in nearly 20 years. The deficit is set to rise further, to USDollars 15bn this year and nearly USDollars 20bn in the peak spending year, although these figures will be less daunting if the private sector is attracted into some of the projects. Mr Lee Chong-ying, vice-minister of finance, said the government has no plans to raise taxes to cut the deficit, although critics say tax increases are inevitable. Although many of the infrastructure projects are welcomed, especially those aimed at improving the island's transport network and energy supply, the plan is widely assumed to be inflationary. The government has set a medium-term inflation target of 3.5 per cent, but wages are continuing to rise at close to 10 per cent and many economists think inflation will reach upwards of 5 per cent, high by Taiwanese standards. Mr Yu Tzong-shian, president of the Chung Hua Economic Research institute, estimated inflation will rise to 4-5 per cent in the medium term, perhaps higher 'if the plan is finished on time'. Inflation will he helped, however, if the New Taiwanese dollar continues to appreciate, pushing import prices down. After rising against the US dollar by 50 per cent between 1986 and 1989, the Taiwanese unit has stabilised. Further gains are likely in the next 12 months because of Taiwan's strong trade position and pressure from the US, which claims the currency is being kept artificially low. Exports have continued to rise, in spite of world recession, thanks to increased trade with China. For political reasons, this is conducted indirectly, mainly through Hong Kong. Taiwan's exports to China increased 38 per cent for the first five months to USDollars 2.3bn while exports to the US, still Taiwan's most important market, and Europe fell slightly. About 95 per cent of exports are industrial products and total exports last year increased 13 per cent to USDollars 76.2bn. For the first seven months of this year exports rose 8.3 per cent from the comparable period to USDollars 46.8bn. But imports have risen faster, gaining 14 per cent to USDollars 41.3bn for the year so far, leading to a 17 per cent reduction in the island's trade surplus. This is due to rising imports of consumer goods, capital equipment for infrastructure projects and Taiwan's continuing reliance on Japanese machinery and semi-conductor imports. Thirty per cent of total imports come from Japan and this led to a USDollars 9.7bn trade deficit last year, a 27 per cent increase. The deficit is likely to increase as infrastructure projects accelerate, and will rise again if Taiwan's bid for membership of the GATT is successful. Restrictions on Japanese car imports, protection of Taiwan's agricultural products and discriminatory government overseas purchasing programmes, which tend to favour the US and exclude Japan, will have to be reformed if Taiwan is to join the trade body. The continuing tight labour market has led to complaints from business of a shortage of skilled and low skilled workers, which is adding to costs by driving wages up. Although the government was initially reluctant to import foreign labour, fearing it would stop companies upgrading, it has now relented and approved the importation of up to 50,000 workers, mainly from south-east Asia. But businessmen say this is not enough and wages will continue to rise faster than inflation. Rapid wage rises are most noticeable in newly reformed sectors of the economy. Earlier this year, for example, 15 new banking licences were granted, leading to intense competition for the island's scarce supply of experienced commercial bankers.</p>

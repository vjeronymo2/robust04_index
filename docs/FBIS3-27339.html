According to officials with the Hebei Provincial Transport  Bureau, preparations for the bidding have been completed and the  offering of tenders will be officially opened next month.    The Shijiazhuang-Anyang expressway, at a length of 216 km,  will involve a use of 240 million U.S. dollars in loans from the  World Bank, the largest World Bank loans China has ever used.    Construction of the section from Beijing to Shijiazhuang,  with a length of more than 280 km, has been completed and was  put into use at the end of last year.    Construction of subsequent sections of the expressway  southward from Anyang city, in central China's Henan Province,  will be undertaken by the provinces through which the  thoroughfare passes.    The officials said that they had completed the arrangements  with the help of the China International Bidding Company and had  already published tendering promotion materials on the world  highway construction market.    According to the officials, more than 30 businessmen  involved  in contracting projects from all over the world have come and  carried out on-the-spot investigations of the  Shijiazhuang-Anyang section.    The officials added that construction of the  Shijiazhuang-Anyang section would start in May, after the  bidding is finished.</p>

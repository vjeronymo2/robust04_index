			<p>BFN     [Text] Sergey Filatov, the Russian president's chief of  staff, expressed his regret that the democratic forces of the  country were not united and called for convening a Congress of  Russia's Democratic Forces.    Talking to journalists outside the hall where the founding  congress of the Russia's Democratic Choice was held, he said  that such a forum could be convened next fall to overcome the  disunity.    Asked whether he would join Russia's Democratic Choice,  whose  congress he had helped to organize, Filatov said that he would  do so if the platform of that organization suited him.</p>

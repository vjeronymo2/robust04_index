			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Sarajevo, June 12 (AFP) -- Rockets slammed into  the northern Serb-held town of Brcko on Sunday [12 June], but  Bosnia's fragile two-day-old truce was otherwise holding, a UN  spokesman said. Five or six rockets from an unknown source fell  at midday in the first truce violation at Brcko since the  UN-brokered ceasefire came into effect on Friday, Commander Eric  Chaperon said.    "However, the overall situation remains calm, with a  slightly  higher level of activity than in the morning," he said in  mid-afternoon. [passage omitted] Chaperon said earlier he did  not know where the shells had been fired from.    Brcko commands a narrow strip of land across northern  Bosnia-Herzegovina that forms a crucial supply line for Serbs  between their stronghold of Banja Luka in the west and Serbia to  the east. The area, known as the Posavina corridor, has seen a  build-up by both Bosnian army and separatist Serb forces in the  past two months.    Chaperon said UN troops recorded 11 detonations at the  northeastern town of Srebrenik, a few detonations at Dastansko,  in central Bosnia, and 16 mortar rounds at Ribnica, a Bosnian  army position in the north of the republic. A UN patrol at  Gorazde in eastern Bosnia "came under light arms fire from  Bosnian Serb forces," Chaperon added.    In the northwestern Moslem pocket of Bihac, the situation  was  calm Sunday after attacks a day earlier by Bosnian army forces  in which they recovered territory captured by secessionists  loyal to maverick Moslem leader Fikret Abdic, Chaperon said.

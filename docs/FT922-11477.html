			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Fowler favourite to be Tory chairman SIR Norman Fowler, a former cabinet minister and Mr John Major's 'minder' during the election campaign, is odds-on favourite to succeed Mr Chris Patten as Tory party chairman. Mr Major is said to share Mr Patten's belief that the job should go to a political heavyweight instead of - as sometimes happens just after an election - a 'caretaker'. Sir Norman resigned from Mrs Thatcher's administration early in 1990 to spend more time with his family after a long cabinet career, but has remained active as a senior backbencher at Westminster. An announcement is expected soon, although Mr Patten will stay on until after next month's local elections before taking up his post as governor of Hong Kong in July. Mr Jeffrey Archer, the author and former deputy chairman, who played a vigorous role in the Tory election campaign and has been tireless in his work for the party, is said to be a contender. Another candidate who has been mentioned is Dame Angela Rumbold, who became the party's deputy chairman and a privy councillor in the post-election reshuffle. The party chairman is necessarily someone who enjoys the prime minister's trust, but the post does not carry automatic cabinet rank. Since he left the cabinet Sir Norman has become a non-executive director of NFC, the transport company, and Evered Bardon, the quarry products group. Mr Patten is said to believe there are important and strategic decisions to be taken over the next three to four years, not least in reducing the party's overdraft. He is also believed to be confident that the organisation was effective during the election campaign, for example in the targeting of marginal seats.</p>

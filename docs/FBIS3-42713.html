			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Nikolay Podlipskiy: "Russia Is Ready To Limit </F> Aluminum Production"]    [Text] This week Russia will most probably announce  its consent to a voluntary 500,000-tonne cut in its aluminum  production capacities. This conclusion can be drawn from the  speeches of members of the government Commission on Operations  Problems, the first 1994 meeting of which was held yesterday in  the Government House, on Krasnopresnenskaya Embankment.  <H5>  The State of Russia's Aluminum Industry: </H5>    -  Primary  aluminum production in 1993 constituted about 2,900 million  tonnes    -  Of this amount, 2.3 million tonnes were processed in  Russia    -  By September 1993, primary aluminum production had been  cut back by only 7 percent    -  The amount of aluminum processed at  Russian enterprises was cut to 0.3 million tonnes    Three  questions were introduced at the meeting of the commission,  which was chaired by Oleg Soskovets, first vice-premier. The  most important of them, unquestionably, was the draft of the  governmental decree "On Measures To Stabilize the Work of the  Aluminum Industry." In the words of Serafim Afonin, chairman of  the Russian Committee on Metallurgy, up to September of last  year the sector was working quite stably. After that, however,  because of the increased ruble outlay for electric power (its  share in the production cost increased from 17 to 34 percent on  the average for the sector) and because of rapidly growing  transport costs, practically all 11 Russian aluminum plants  entered the "corridor of loss" (the boundaries of which are  determined by the prices for the metal on the world market, on  the one hand, and the relation of the ruble and the dollar in  Russia, on the other).    Russian aluminum producers are therefore faced with two very  major problems at a minimum. In the first place, the forthcoming  500,000-tonne cutback in production. It is obvious that this  government decision lays the foundation for a bitter fight on  the part of the directors to protect their plants from  artificial shutdown. The words of one of the directors of the  Bratsk Aluminum Plant may serve as confirmation of the fact that  there will be no place for corporate solidarity in this fight:  "Yes, we must curtail production, but let us do it somewhere  over there" (he has in mind the plants in the European part of  the country). If the government, however, still refuses  voluntary mothballing of capacities, the European Union will  maintain rigid quotas for the import of Eastern aluminum, and on  the American market, in the words of Aleksandr Shokhin, a  multitude of anti-dumping processes awaits us. This can in the  end lead to the loss of these two very important Russian  aluminum export markets (approximately 1.0-1.4 million tonnes a  year).    The aluminum plant directors attending the meeting, however,  were inclined to blame most of their economic disorder on the  electric power workers who, in their opinion, unjustifiably  raised the prices for their products too high. They feel that  the best way out of this situation is to fix prices for electric  power at a level of 0.7-1.0 American cents per kilowatt-hour.  Lira Rozenova, chairman of the Russian Committee on Prices,  however, thought that this price was too low, and agreed that,  as an experiment, the price could be set at a level of 1.5 cents  per kilowatt-hour. This, in her opinion, would cause only a  5-percent price rise for electricity for other consumers. The  representatives of the electric power workers, however, agreed  with neither the one nor the other variant.    As a result, the members of the commission came to the  conclusion that the draft of the government decree submitted by  the Russian Metallurgy Committee has to be finalized in a week.  In the words of Oleg Soskovets, the main attention should be  paid to raising the domestic demand for aluminum, sharply  reduced as the result of the diminishing of orders from the  country's military-industrial complex. In addition, at the  meeting of the commission the idea was again raised of cartel  agreements: it was proposed to the aluminum and electric power  producers that they come to an agreement on a bilateral basis on  lowering prices for the goods they supplied each other.  Incidentally, a day earlier, Soskovets, in an interview with a  KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent, noted: "In this country, it is  not the fact of carrying out a cartel agreement, but that they  cannot come to an agreement on it."</p>

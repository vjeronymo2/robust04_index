Director General of Foreign Trade Joko Muljono yesterday  said  that since as early as March 1991, EEC officials have indicated  that car radio imports from Indonesia had less than 60 percent  local content and were therefore ineligible to receive the GSP  facility.    However, since Indonesian exporters did not take heed of the  warning, the EEC sent a fact-finding commission to Indonesia in  March 1993, which discovered concrete evidence showing that  several companies had violated the GSP terms," Joko said.    "The EEC asked the Indonesian Government to deal firmly with  the violators and threatened that if the violations were not  stopped, it would disqualify, not only car radios, but all  Indonesian products from the GSP facility," he said.    Joko said the Indonesian Government is presently handling  the  case and the director of foreign trade relations has been  negotiating with the EEC in Brussels since February 21.    "As of March 1993, we found eight companies proven to have  violated GSP regulations," he said.    "We appeal to Indonesian companies to have a higher sense of  integrity by obeying the agreed regulations because the  violation of several companies will damage the integrity of all  other exporters to Europe," he said.    Joko said the components used for the car radios exported to  the EEC were imported from various countries, including Korea  and Malaysia.</p>

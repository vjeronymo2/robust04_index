			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast] </F>   [Text] An official delegation of the State Duma, headed by  its chairman Ivan Rybkin, set off for a visit to Germany in  order to study the experience of the German parliament.    [Begin recording] [Correspondent N. Miroshnik] Before the  State Duma delegation left by air for Germany, delegation head  Ivan Rybkin said that the program of the trip includes a visit  to the Western Group of Forces, and a meeting with commander  General Burlakov. On the subject of providing facilities for  servicemen, the speaker gave assurances:    [Rybkin] The sums in the budget allocated for paying  servicemen's wages are protected, that is they cannot be removed  or reduced under any conditions.    [Miroshnik] Servicemen in this case, like cultural  institutions, are put on a level with the least protected strata  of society -- children and veterans. A total of 40.6 trillion  rubles has been allocated for defense in the new budget, and,  Rybkin believes, this sum is sufficient for the normal  maintenance of the Army.    [Rybkin] For the first time in the past three years, the  Army  has a firmly fixed sum for its maintenance.    [Miroshnik] Furthermore, 1.2 trillion rubles has been put in  a non-budgetary fund. It is expected that this money will be  received from the income from monetary privatization. Experts  believe that the actual income from that will be no less than 12  trillion rubles, and in this case:    [Rybkin] All the income from privatization in excess of 1.2  trillion rubles will go toward building housing for servicemen  and toward conversion.

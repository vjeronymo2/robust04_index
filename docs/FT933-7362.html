			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / Despatches: Apartheid and the arts WHEN the all-white dancers of South Africa's Transvaal state ballet performed in the black township of Tsakane, they were careful to ensure that a chain-link fence separated them from the black audience. It was not violence they feared. Tsakane is a peaceful place. But the bored ballerinas and their haughty artistic director, Dawn Weller Raistrick, seemed to want to make a point: that the troupe was there only under protest. Fearing that a black government would cut off state funding for traditionally 'white' art forms such as ballet and opera, the ballerinas were making a belated attempt to popularise their craft. But they were not going to do it cheerfully. As the struggle for power intensifies in South African politics, so it does in the world of culture. Those who favour 'Eurocentric' art forms fear a cultural bloodbath under a black government. As art critic Barry Ronge wrote in the Johannesburg Sunday Times recently, whites are tortured by 'visions of ballet being kicked into oblivion by the gumboots of traditional dancers and of orchestras . . . fading into dissonance before the throb of the . . . cowhide drum.' These fears are probably misplaced, for when the African National Congress convened a national cultural conference recently, its officials were at pains to convey a reassuring message to frightened whites: ballet, opera and symphony will continue to have a treasured place in the new South Africa, but they will have to get by with less state money. 'For state money not to be put into opera would be like attacking the Voortrekker monument,' said one delegate to the conference, referring to the granite pile outside Pretoria regarded by Afrikaners as their most sacred monument. ANC officials know that there is no quicker way to accelerate the white 'brain drain' than to attack yuppie pursuits such as opera and ballet; they know that a message of cultural reconciliation will help whites (especially Afrikaners) accept political change. 'As much as possible, we must preserve ballet, we must preserve opera, we must preserve symphony, we must preserve what European South Africans have contributed to this country,' says Wally Serote, head of the ANC's department of arts and culture. 'But we cannot preserve that at the expense of other things.' That is the problem in a nutshell. For in the old South Africa, culture was as strictly segregated as housing or education. Abolishing cultural apartheid will be as costly as upgrading black schools or hospitals. Until recently, the four provincial 'performing arts councils,' which have their own standing ballet and opera companies and their own symphony orchestras, funded 'white' arts exclusively. They built no arts venues in black townships (white Johannesburg recently spent R132m (Pounds 26.2m) to refurbish its civic theatre, though neighbouring Soweto, a city of 3m, has no theatre or concert hall). They spent almost nothing on black theatre, dance or music. For over 40 years, the ruling National Party used the state-funded arts to promote Afrikaner ethnicity, with the political goal of strengthening the volk against the black hordes. Indeed, a 1972 government commission of enquiry into arts funding treated only Afrikaans art under its chapter on 'indigenous art forms in South Africa' - as though black African art did not exist. And though the arts councils are trying to redress this balance, their efforts have gone little beyond tokenism. If the National Party abused culture as a tool of oppression, the ANC used it as a political weapon in the struggle against apartheid. When other forms of dissent were crushed, black actors and playwrights protested alone, and the ANC-inspired international cultural boycott brought pressure for change. The task now is to depoliticise the arts, to prevent the ANC from using the state-funded arts, as the Afrikaners did before them, to promote their ethnic interests. ANC officials are adamant that this is not their intention, but some artists are sceptical. And Wally Serote's proposal for arts funding - that the government should fund an autonomous national arts council which would disperse funds to mostly private production companies - sounds fine until he adds that the council would have to follow government-set spending priorities to redress imbalances caused by apartheid. Still, these imbalances must be redressed, not least because the ANC's dream of building a new South African nationhood depends upon it. Cultural apartheid exacerbated ethnic divisions; the ANC's aim is to create a 'non-racial' state where culture unites rather than divides. That is laudable. But given the reality of ethnic antagonism in South Africa, it is a long-term goal. Mixed audiences are rare. The bulk of arts performances are Eurocentric, the bulk of audiences white. The arts council directors say that output is, at least in part, market-driven: white patrons buy the tickets, and for the moment, they want to hear their own stories, watch their own dance forms and listen to their own cultural sounds. The ANC says its stress is always on uplifting African arts, not suppressing European ones. 'The basics of opera - voice and story-telling - are really African forms of art,' says Mike van Graan, secretary of the National Arts Initiative, an anti-apartheid cultural group. He is confident that, eventually, South Africans will learn to appreciate each other's art forms, and forge new forms of their own. That, after all, is what the new South Africa is all about.</p>

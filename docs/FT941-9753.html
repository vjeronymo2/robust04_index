			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Finance and the Family: Send for the doctors - Independent adviser Hill Martin. Third of a series Peter Smith has no hesitation in identifying what he thinks sets Hill Martin apart from the pack of independent financial advisers: 'We are managed from the front by Mark Ormerod and Nicholas Mercer, the two founders of the firm; there are no fat cats here trying to cream it off. And we are completely client-orientated. 'Financial diagnosis is very like medical diagnosis. The good doctor will diagnose the trouble only when he has thoroughly examined the patient, and we take the view that we cannot help clients until we know them.' Smith, the regional director, joined Bristol-based Hill Martin in 1990, having previously been technical director of Sedgwick Personal Financial Management and divisional director of personal financial planning at accountant Ernst &amp; Young. He admits he had 'a terrible crisis' in joining a smaller firm. 'I sorted out this out by going in and looking at the files. Mark Ormerod just said 'help yourself.' By the end of half an hour, I was satisfied.' Clients who may be worried about putting their investments with any but household names do not have the same opportunity to scrutinise the books, and Smith sympathises with their fears. 'If you are NM Rothschild, no one asks a question about it. If you are Hill Martin, they do, and I don't blame them. That is where the Levitts of this world have got us. 'I had one client with Pounds 165,000 who was hesitating. At last, she said: 'I see; I just have to trust you.' I said 'Yes, you do, and you can'.' While Hill Martin's head office remains in its original rabbit warren of rooms in Bristol's financial heart, the firm has shifted course somewhat over the years, not least in its whole-hearted adoption of a fee-paying structure. Initially, some clients paid commissions; today, all new clients are charged on a time/cost basis. Fees are agreed after the first meeting with clients. Smith explains: 'We write and quote a fee and then say whether commission offset might be applicable. On medium to small cases, we always take commission and offset it, because of the VAT position. On big cases, we prefer benefit enhancement to see if we can reduce the costs of the product to the client.' VAT is payable on fees but not on commission. Client fees average Pounds 750 to Pounds 1,500, although those for more substantial cases are likely to be in the Pounds 2,000-3,000 bracket. Clients usually are sent a questionnaire before the initial meeting, although Hill Martin is selective about who gets this quite detailed form - which closes with the question: 'At what age would you like to retire/achieve financial independence?' Once a client's financial situation has been analysed, and the Hill Martin recommendations put forward, there is a further meeting before the advice is implemented. There are four linked operations: financial strategy planning; investment management; pensions; and residential and commercial finance. The aim is to offer a one-stop service. Clients' affairs are reviewed regularly and they receive market commentaries and bulletins during the year. Smith says: 'What we are interested in is long-term relationships with clients. If they don't want that, they shouldn't come here.' Smith expects that future growth will come from expanding the firm's investment management, financial planning and pensions departments. Indeed, investment management has been boosted already by the arrival of Michael Rose, formerly investment director at ANZ Grindlays Private Bank; he joined Graeme Farquharson, the investment director, in 1992. Farquharson himself has managed portfolios for Hill Martin since 1983. Smith says: 'On portfolios of up to Pounds 50,000, we put clients into unit trusts. On sums over Pounds 100,000, they are all in Savile Row suits.' The Savile Row brigade receive four valuations a year; off-the-peg investors get two. The annual investment management fee is 1 per cent. Since September 1992, Hill Martin has compiled portfolio performance statistics - historic yardsticks that should be increasingly useful as standards of comparison for prospective clients. Strangely, however, they seldom ask to see these figures, which illustrate the performance that has been achieved for others. At the end of last year, Hill Martin's standard growth portfolio was showing a compound annual return of 29.92 per cent since launch; the balanced portfolio an annualised return of 28.34 per cent; and the income portfolio one of 20.77 per cent. 'The portfolios are designed to go with other products like zero preference shares, gilts and National Savings that don't require active management,' says Smith. Like all investment managers, he has had mixed fortunes. 'I was looking for a low-risk investment for our clients recently and, at launch, I picked on Exeter Zero Preference fund. It was 25p with a 2p discount. It has had something like a 65 per cent capital appreciation. I have a client with Pounds 50,000 in it, and it has paid for his past two Christmases. We drew Pounds 5,000 in the first year and Pounds 6,000 this year. 'But I also had a client who bought Exeter High Income at 53p and, the next time I looked at it in the valuation, it was 37p.' Hill Martin clients typically have assets of around Pounds 500,000 (including their house) and an income of Pounds 30,000 to Pounds 50,000, according to Smith. He adds: 'We are really only talking about a reasonably wealthy section of the population.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- THE INDEPENDENTS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Name of financial adviser:        Hill Martin plc.

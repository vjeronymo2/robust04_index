			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:CSO     [Excerpts] [passage omitted] On 29 October, an investment  project got underway in Chiang Mai--the largest investment  project ever started.    This land development project that has caused such a stir is  called the Little Duck Chiang Mai Square project. It will be  built on 300 rai of land along the superhighway not far from the  railroad station. Approximately 10 billion baht will be  invested. It has 12 major components, including a  30,000-square-meter department store, a 700-room hotel, an  amusement center, a water park, an amusement park, a marketing  center, and a commodities market. It will take five years to  complete. It would be difficult to find another investor who  could match its size in terms of the land alone. [passage  omitted]    The company behind the Little Duck Chiang Mai Square project  is the Little Duck Group. And when you talk about this group,  you think of ``Sia [Godfather] P. Pet,'' or Thanong  Siriprichaphong. This man is well known is many circles,  including business and political circles. He is also well known  for getting what he wants and for taking risks. There is an aura  of great mystery surrounding him.    The company's name is Little Duck, but Sia P. Pet [duck]  does  not resemble a ``little duck.'' He has built his reputation in  various ways, and it is difficult to see and understand things.  To say that he is a ``wild animal'' or that he is ``without  form'' isn't correct. There really isn't very much information  about him. It's said that he ``waits'' in dark corners. Most of  the things said about him are just rumors about his business  background and how he spends his free time. Sia P. Pet rarely  gives interviews and he refuses to talk about himself. The best  a reporter can hope for is one or two answers to his questions.    He was born in Si Chiang Mai District, Nong Khai Province,  on  24 February 1952. He earned a liberal arts degree from the  University of Honolulu. He came from a middle-class family.  After he completed secondary school, his family moved to Nakhon  Phanom Province and began exporting and importing forest  products and scrap iron from Laos. He got rich by selling  various items to American military bases during the period when  there were large numbers of American soldiers in Nakhon Phanom.  He is married to Pratsarai Siriprichaphong, the former president  of the Nakhon Phanom provincial council.    Superficially, it appears that the only businesses operated  by the Little Duck Group are the three Little Duck hotels in  Pathaya and Chiang Rai. The Little Duck Pathaya Hotel, which  changed its name from Pathaya Resort Hotel, is home to one of  the best-known discos in Pathaya, the Sea Sand Club Resort,  opposite Nong Nut Park. And there are two Little Duck hotels in  Chiang Rai. But actually, there are 21 companies in this group.  The most recent addition to the group is the Little Duck Land  Development Company, the owner of the huge project in Chiang  Mai. This is a sign that the Little Duck Group is taking the  offensive in land development activities.    At the end of 1992, the Little Duck Group owned 19  companies.  One that people have probably heard about and will remember is  the Little Duck Travel Agency Ltd., which was granted the right  to advertise on Television Channel 9, Communications Authority  of Thailand, during the period that Police Captain Chaloem  Yubamrung served as minister attached to the Office of the Prime  Minister. Later on, problems arose, charges were filed, and the  company lost the case in court.    In 1986, [the group] purchased the Rin Hotel from Saengduan  na Nakhon. Over the course of several years, administration was  improved and the hotel was then sold to the Khwoyuha Group of  Winnu Khuwanon. Before the Pathaya Resort Hotel become the  Little Duck Pathaya Hotel, there were reports that it too had  been sold. And there have frequently been rumors that the Little  Duck Chiang Rai hotels were going to be sold. People have  criticized Sia P. Pet for ``building hotels and then selling  them if he can make a good profit.'' And after the hotel  business in Chiang Rai went into a slump and prices were  slashed, there were rumors that he had offered to sell his  hotels to Chatri Sophanaphanit for 800 million baht. But Sia P.  Pet is still the owner. When the Welcome Plaza and Welcome Chom  Thian Beach hotels of his brother, Rungruang Siriprichaphong are  included, the hotels owned by the Little Duck Group have a total  of 1,800 rooms.    The main asset now held by the Little Duck Group is land. It  is estimated that Sia P. Pet owns at least 2,000 rai. Most of it  is in excellent locations just waiting to be developed. These  sites are located in major cities such as Chiang Mai, Chiang  Rai, Pathaya, Phuket, Samui, Nakhon Phanom, and Bangkok. In Doi  Hang Village in Chiang Rai, he owns more than 500 rai. When THAN  SETTHAKIT asked P. Pet how much land he owns, he said, ``I can't  reveal that.'' But what he did tell THAN SETTHAKIT was that in  the future, his group plans to focus mainly on land development  because the economy is improving. Besides the large project in  Chiang Mai, other projects that will get underway next year  include the construction of a large open-air market and bus  station in Nakhon Phanom, which will cost 300-400 million baht.  There is also the Doi Hang Village land development project in  Chiang Rai, which calls for the construction of semi-resort  guest houses where visitors can enjoy nature and the atmosphere.  Another project is to build a hotel in Phuket. When asked how  many projects the group has planned, Sia P. Pet smiled and, as  usual, said, ``I don't want to discuss that.''    ``At present, I spend most of my time on politics,  particularly visiting people. As for business activities, I am  already set. I can move ahead on my own. I have a team and a  board of directors that monitors things.''    Besides the Little Duck of Sia P. Pet, which is moving  forward at great speed, Rungruang Siriprichaphong is preparing  to move ahead, too. Rungruang owns more than 400 rai of land in  good locations in Pathaya, Siracha, Laem Chabang, and Ao Udom.  The market price of this land is about 8-10 million baht per  rai. Rungruang said that he is preparing to develop it and build  several housing development projects. He has much experience in  this in both Pathaya and Bangkok. The Sin Thani housing  development, the first project, will probably be completed by  the beginning of 1994.    Rungruang thinks that the economic situation is quite  favorable. Next year, the economy will certainly pick up.  Interest rates have now declined. ``When an opportunity arises,  we have to invest in order to improve our cash flow. Having  property only is not good. You have to convert some of the  property into cash.''    Probably only a few people know that Rungruang made great  inroads in Bangkok when he invested jointly with the Imperial  Group in the Imperial World Lat Phrao project. Rungruang is both  a shareholder and the deputy managing director of the company.  This is because the 30 rai on which the project was built  belongs to him. But Rungruang modestly said that he doesn't own  very many shares. His relations with the Imperial group have led  to talks about having the Imperial group open a branch in Chiang  Mai in the Little Duck Chiang Mai Square project.    Turning back to Sia P. Pet and his political activities, Sia  P. Pet, or Peter as he is called in English, has been involved  in politics for a long time. He first won a seat in parliament  as a member of the Social Action Party in 1983 and was a  ``disciple'' of ``Achan Mom.'' [Khukrit Pramot] But in 1986 he  changed parties to be with ``Loem Daothiam'' [Chaloem Yubamrung]  and ran against General Mana Rattanakoset, the former leader of  the People's Party. Sia P. Pet was defeated then. The third  time, in the 1988 election, he moved and relied on the prestige  of ``Kamnan Po,'' that is, Somchai Khunplum, a well-known figure  in the eastern region. He ran in Chonburi but was defeated  again. At the beginning of 1992 he ran in Nakhon Phanom. This  time, he joined forces with General Mana and ran as a member of  the People's Party. He again failed. In the second election of  1992, Sia P. Pet finally managed to win as a member of the Thai  Nation Party. That time, General Mana did not run.    Sia P. Pet faces another major political battle now that  General Chawalit Yongchaiyut, the leader of the New Aspiration  Party, has moved his base from Nonthaburi and plans to run in  Nakhon Phanom in the same zone as Sia P. Pet. Many people  predict that in the next election, he will lose for the fourth  time. But Sia P. Pet has said that he will do his best. He has  no plans to leave politics. He is very worried but this is  pressuring him to work every harder. ``I am not afraid. I will  fight hard. Whether I win or lose is up to the people.''    On the political front, Sia P. Pet faces a very tough  challenge. But on the business front, Sia P. Pet, or the Little  Duck Group, does not risk defeat. Instead, this is a time when  the group is beginning to spread its wings and soar.</p>

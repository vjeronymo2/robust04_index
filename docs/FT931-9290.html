			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / Modest repairs to ERM 'fault lines' The British prime minister, John Major, is likely to be remembered for at least one phrase -  'fault lines in the ERM'. Investigations of sorts have begun into ways of improving the functioning of the mechanism in two forums: the EC's Monetary Committee based in Brussels and the Committee of Central Bank Governors. The main thought beginning to emerge is that it is not the 'fault lines' but misaligned parities which have been responsible for recent convulsions, particularly in Italy and Britain. The following themes have so far occupied the discussion: The attempt to operate the ERM as a set of permanently fixed parities in 1987-92 was premature. More systematic international study needs to be made to spot currency misalignments in advance and make necessary adjustments before they are forced by the markets. This might be helped if some international body can take the initiative. The most likely candidate, on which some on the British side seem keen, is the European Monetary Institute, to start in 1994, with the inauguration of Stage Two of European Monetary Union. It is likely to be based in Bonn and headed by Mr Wim Duisenberg of the Dutch central bank. The inclinations of some French policymakers -  although not of officials at the sharp end -  for narrower ERM margins have been offset by the Bundesbank's belief that if there are any changes they should be made towards wider ones. As a result, no changes are likely. There has been some not very well-defined pressure for 'greater symmetry' of burden-sharing between strong and weak currencies. How this can be introduced without weakening the duty of Germany, or any other future anchor country, to give priority to fighting inflation has not been explained. German representatives have countered that they in fact lose because repayment obligations are not in D-marks, but in Ecus. The Bundesbank for its part has expressed unhappiness at the theoretical commitment to unlimited intervention when currencies are up against their margins in their ERM grid. The above three points are likely to be bypassed by putting greater emphasis on discretionary intervention to protect currencies well before they reach their limits. Many of the above themes were already present in the Basle-Nyborg agreement in the late 1980s. Much the most important of them is the intention to reintroduce more frequent parity changes. The very limited realignments which are possible within the ERM margins raise problems both of market management and of a more fundamental kind. Take one current example. Should the French franc appreciate or depreciate against the D-mark? On the so-called fundamentals -  prices, costs, budgets and the balance of payments -  the franc should appreciate. There are, however, a few French economists who say that these benefits are bought at the expense of high and rising unemployment and that the franc should depreciate instead. France could not be treated in isolation. German unemployment is also rising; and the EMI would have eventually to be redrawn into guessing so-called 'fundamental equilibrium exchange rates'. This is like looking in a dark room for a black cat which is not there. French and German officials can say that the arguments for changing the franc/D-mark parity in opposite directions offset each other and only underline the case for stability. But even if they can ride through the period up to and after the French elections, there will be other even more difficult cases. The Fed does not attempt to calculate fundamental equilibrium exchange rates for all the US states, but simply takes for granted that the costs of having separate currencies outweigh the benefits, and bases its monetary policy on average US experience. This is the way in which European monetary policy will have to develop -  or move to a looser ERM with much wider margins than any now contemplated.</p>

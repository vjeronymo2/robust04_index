			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Health body calls in police WEST MIDLANDS Regional Health Authority has decided to call in police following a critical district auditor's report on a Pounds 2.5m cost-cutting study. The study, carried out by United Research Group, a US consultancy, was intended to identify ways of saving up to Pounds 50m in the authority's supplies division through better purchasing and greater efficiency. The auditor found that the study - which managers admit yielded few benefits  -was badly managed and involved Pounds 350,000 of expenses, including entertainment. The decision to call in the police followed discussions with the Audit Commission, which supervises the district auditors' service. It reflected 'the serious nature of the report and its contents', a spokesman for the authority said. Mr Stuart Fletcher, the authority's managing director, and its chairman, Sir James Ackers, are expected to meet the chief constable of West Midlands police shortly. Last week, Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, strengthened the management of the authority by sending in Sir Roy Griffiths, one of the most senior figures in the National Health Service. Sir Roy, who is deputy chairman of the National Health Service policy board, will help the authority to strengthen and improve management controls so that they command public confidence.</p>

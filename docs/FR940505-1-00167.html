This proposal could facilitate investment in electrification or alternative fuel usage. By combining an investing company's average emissions with that of another company, the electrified or alternative fuel railroad company could help subsidize its investment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA does not see the need for an emissions cap with this program. A cap may be necessary because the averaging program is based upon fuel used. EPA believes it unlikely that the amount of fuel used by railroad companies will increase in the South Coast. The trend in current engine design is toward increased fuel efficiency, and railroad companies place a high premium on saving fuel. It is in the best economic interests of the railroads to do so. EPA thus expects the positive trend in fuel efficiency to continue. The only way there could possibly be an increase in emissions or less emissions reductions for the rail sector than projected, due to increased fuel usage, would be for the railroad industry to experience rapid expansion. If this were to happen, actual net emissions in the South Coast would probably be positively affected because it would mean that more freight was being hauled by rail instead of truck. Alternatively it could be as a result of expansion in mass transit trains. In either case, the net emission impact in the South Coast would be in a positive direction. EPA therefore is not proposing an actual emissions cap at this time, however EPA requests comment on the need for including a cap on emissions produced from locomotive sources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This regulatory program is aimed exclusively at the South Coast FIP area. Moreover, EPA's authority to propose this program is at least partially derived from California's own authority. EPA therefore encourages California authorities to manage this program or propose a program that achieves similar reductions. EPA believes that California would be more sensitive to the specific issues and problems of implementing a program of this nature. If California were to agree to manage this program, California would handle the administration and enforcement of this program. In any event, California will retain the right to regulate operational changes in the railroad industry within California. This includes but is not limited to time spent idling, rail lubrication, and operating times, etc. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) Compliance. EPA is proposing under the South Coast locomotive fleet average standard program that each railroad company that intends to operate locomotives or locomotive engines within the geographical confines of the South Coast should designate certain locomotives or locomotive engines which will operate within the South Coast. When these locomotives or locomotive engines operate in the South Coast, fuel usage for each locomotive type shall be recorded by the locomotive operator. Such records shall be submitted to EPA in March of each calendar year for the preceding year of operation and be kept for a period of five years. EPA will specify in its national regulation what test procedure and method will be used for certifying an engine at a particular emissions level.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA proposes that each individual railroad company which owns or operates locomotive emission sources within the South Coast keep a roster of engines and locomotives that operate within the South Coast. This roster would include the locomotive type, the engine type and relevant emission characteristic data on the engine. Summary rosters shall be reported to the Administrator yearly, and supporting data is proposed to be kept for a period of 5 years thereafter. Locomotives and locomotive engines that are designated to operate within the South Coast would be marked by a permanent identifier on the engine and labels displayed prominently on both sides of the exterior of the locomotive which will identify the locomotive as a South Coast designated locomotive.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA would reserve the right to audit any locomotive emission source in regard to performance and compliance, that EPA finds operating within the South Coast. EPA inspectors would be given rights of access to inspect railroad property and equipment. Any non-South Coast designated locomotive or locomotive engine or locomotive emission source that EPA finds operating in the South Coast without being properly identified or without proper maintenance could face instant fines as high as $25,000 per day of operation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Each company that operates locomotives is responsible for meeting its individual fleet average emissions standard. EPA proposes to assess annual noncompliance penalties for companies similar to those described for heavy-duty noncompliance in section 3(D)(3) of this document. Each company that operates one or more locomotives will have to show compliance each year with the fleet average emissions standard. Any excess emissions produced beyond the average will be assessed an annual noncompliance fee of $10,000 per ton of emissions produced. This penalty is in addition to any charged for a violation as described in the preceding paragraphs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) Authority. EPA is proposing this South Coast emission averaging standard program under its broad remedial authority under section 110(c). No provision of section 213, section 209, or any other sections of the Clean Air Act, clearly prohibits EPA from exercising its section 110(c) in the manner proposed herein.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

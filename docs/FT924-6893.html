			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / Motorists face urban road pricing, warns MacGregor MR John MacGregor, transport secretary, yesterday signalled that motorists would have to start paying for the use of the roads in London and other cities in the next few years. Tolls would be collected electronically, with meters in cars activated by roadside transmitters clocking up charges according to distance travelled, vehicle type and time of day. Mr MacGregor appears to have accepted that charging people on a pay-as-you-go basis is likely to provide the only feasible long-term solution to worsening urban traffic congestion. He also has the support of environment ministers who favour such charges as a means of curbing the rise in carbon dioxide emissions accompanying rapid traffic growth. Speaking at a London traffic conference yesterday, Mr MacGregor in effect launched a campaign to soften up public opinion in readiness for the likely introduction of road pricing in the late 1990s. He said no firm decisions would be taken before the completion of a three-year feasibility study at the end of 1994, but his intention was to get a debate going. Mr MacGregor acknowledged that road pricing was likely to prove unpopular, but said the alternative could be even worse. 'Is increasing congestion, and ultimately gridlock, a more attractive option?' he asked. Road pricing would speed up journey times, improve bus services and cut transport costs, he said. It would also boost trade and commerce by making cities more attractive places in which to live, shop and work. Yesterday's initiative marks an about-turn from the policies of Mrs Thatcher's government, which ruled out road pricing as an infringement of the motorist's right to drive. It may yet face opposition from Mr MacGregor's cabinet colleagues, some of whom will argue that road pricing could turn into a transport version of the poll tax. Motorists already face the possibility of tolls on trunk roads and motorways following the chancellor's announcement last week that this would make it easier for privately-funded toll roads to compete. The Automobile Association attacked the urban road pricing plan, saying it would hit the least well-off. It said precedence should be given to better enforcement of parking controls and improvements in public transport. Car drivers are cutting back on maintenance because of the recession, the RAC said yesterday, Bronwen Maddox writes. In a survey conducted this month in London and Leicester, the motoring organisation found that 12 per cent of motorists had cut back on servicing. The survey found that more than half of CO (carbon monoxide) emissions come from only 13 per cent of vehicles, and one of those emits as much as 40 of the cleanest.</p>

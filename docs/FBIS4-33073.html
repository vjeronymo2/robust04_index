			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["jtr"-signed report: "Striving for Latin American </F> Integration"]    [Text] Bonn, 30 May -- Bolivia's government wants to work  toward making Latin America one, single, free trade zone in the  medium-term. This association should then be integrated into  the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), Bolivia's Trade  and Industry Minister Carlos Morales said in Bonn.    "We want to make use of our Andes Group presidency this year  to get on with Latin American economic integration," Morales  said. That is why at the next Andes Group summit (including  Bolivia, Ecuador, Colombia, and Venezuela) in September, the  presidents of the Mercosur [Common Market of the South]  countries, Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay will also be  invited.    The heads of state are planning a joint preparation of the  all-American conference in Miami in December, which will be  attended by government representatives from Canada, the United  States, and Central and South America. Political and economic  cooperation as well as the fight against drug dealing will be on  the agenda.    Prior to that, on the occasion of the soccer World Cup  opening match between Germany and Bolivia in Chicago, Bolivian  President Sanchez de Lozada wants to discuss Latin America's  future relations with the United States and the European Union  [EU] with Chancellor Kohl and President Clinton.    For Morales, Latin America's integration within NAFTA is a  long-term objective; "before that, we Latin Americans will have  to do our homework." This means that each country has to  stabilize and open up its economy. Therefore, since 1986, his  country has gradually lowered its customs duties to 5 percent  for capital goods and 10 percent for consumer goods. It is also  important that the Mercosur countries quickly agree on common  external duties. The line of conflict runs between Argentina  and Brazil advocating comparatively high import duties on the  one hand, and Paraguay, calling for a much lower import duty on  the other.    Once Mercosur and the Andes Pact have stabilized, they are  to  be merged step by step, Morales said. "The Latin American free  trade zone has to come into existence within the next 10 years,  otherwise we will be helplessly facing a world of integrated  blocs." The minister is convinced that the U.S. Administration  prefers talking to a unified region to talking to individual  countries. An exception to that is economically successful  Chile, the next candidate to be accepted into NAFTA, Morales  said.</p>

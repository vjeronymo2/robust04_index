			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Barclays nerves There was a tumble late in the session in Barclays shares as the market grew increasingly nervous about the possibility of a cut in the dividend when the bank reveals preliminary figures this morning. The stock raced up to 436p during early trading, with dealers confident that the recent scare stories about the final dividend had been overplayed and that the bank's figures would not be as bad as some specialists have forecast. The most bearish observers have pencilled in losses of up to Pounds 150m, with bad debts predicted to come out at around the Pounds 2bn mark. However, a flurry of late selling orders drove Barclays down to a day's low point of 428p before steadying to finish at 433p for a net gain of a penny. Barclays' discomfort during the late afternoon was in sharp contrast to the strong showing of HSBC, which forged ahead to close 23 higher at 624p after the well-received preliminary results from Midland Bank, taken over by HSBC last year. HSBC shares were additionally helped by the good performance of the Hong Kong market. Lloyds, meanwhile, rose 9 to 540p and National Westminster, boosted by switching out of Barclays, put on 8 at 443p in heavy turnover of 5.3m. The outstanding performance of Standard Chartered shares in the run-up to the March 10 figures continued apace, the stock ending 13 stronger at 692p, easily the highest the shares have traded since before the big crash of 1987. Guardian Royal Exchange surprised the market in reporting a return to profits but, equally, disappointed some of the more optimistic analysts who had been looking for a modest increase in the dividend. 'Many analysts questioned the logic of not increasing the dividend after what was seen as a good profits performance,' said one specialist, who added that GRE directors were given a rough ride by analysts during the post-results meeting. GRE shares, initially bid up to 194p, came off sharply as the session wore on, closing only marginally higher at 189p. Turnover was a heavy 10m. Commercial Union was the beneficiary of switching out of GRE, the shares accelerating to finish 15 firmer at 623p. Refuge jumped 20 to 948p after news of the sale of the estate agency businesses. Glaxo was in the forefront of the market's advance, gaining 17 at 678p on turnover of 4.3m. ICI, similarly, raced up 43 to 1233p on good volume of 3.4m. Oil shares delivered another good performance, with US buying interest in the majors accompanied by equally strong support from UK investors. Much of the domestic buying interest in the sector was said to have been generated by an uprating of the sector by SG Warburg Securities, one of the leading UK integrated investment houses. It was said that Warburg had shifted its stance on the oil sector from 'hold' to 'buy', citing the effect of currency movements on the sector. Warburg was thought to have been especially bullish of prospects for the exploration and production sector. Enterprise moved up 7 to 476p and Lasmo 3 to 185p. Of the majors, Shell, said to be Warburg's 'core holding' in the sector, rose 8 to 578p on heavy turnover of 7m. BP added 6 1/2 at 289p, with turnover, boosted by yet more strong support from the US, reaching 13m shares. Specialists are convinced that US investors now speak for around a quarter of BP's equity and that follow-on buying from underweight UK funds could see the shares moving up to 300p in the short term. Speculation late in the session that Williams Holdings, which reports figures today, was about to announce a rights issue and an acquisition left the shares unchanged at 360p after trade of 2.1m. Automated Security climbed 10 to 161p, reflecting increasing optimism over prospects for the group's new TVX mini-surveillance system. The market was cheered by the sharp increase in profits at Thomas Cowie, which jumped 14 to 211p. Perry Group moved in sympathy with Cowie, gaining 10 at 146p. Credit Lyonnais Laing was said to have reduced its profits forcast in European Motor, which receded 9 to 93p. Relief that Cadbury-Schweppes was not the purchaser of Terry's helped its shares firm 9 to 493p. Cadbury has for a long time been mentioned as a bid target for Philip Morris, but analysts pointed out that the purchase of Terry's may now rule out such a move on competition grounds. Profit-taking in Unilever after the boost given to the stock by last week's favourable results left it 15 off at 1208p. A profits downgrade from Cazenove hit Allied-Lyons, sending it down 10 to 593p. The broker is now said to be predicting current-year profits of Pounds 610m, against its previous estimate of around Pounds 625m, and for the following year Pounds 700m, against Pounds 725m. In the rest of the sector, Guiness fell victim to fears of an increase in taxation on drinks in both the US and UK, along with talk that a large stake-holder wanted to sell its holding. The shares gave up 6 to 441p in heavy trade of 6m. Boddington was in demand ahead of today's figures, rising 6 to 216p. Sentiment was further encouraged by talk that the company was planning to dispose of its 19.5 per cent stake in JA Devenish, a penny easier at 273p.</p>

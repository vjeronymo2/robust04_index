			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Exchange advised to drop Pounds 40m computer project FIVE of the City's biggest securities houses have produced a study questioning the need for the London Stock Exchange's latest Pounds 40m computer project, just a month after the exchange scrapped its Taurus development. The study, by Booz Allen, the management consulting firm, concludes that the exchange should buy an existing computer trading system that another stock market uses rather than attempt to rebuild its own ageing Seaq system. The aborted attempt to build Taurus - the paperless settlement system - from scratch, rather than buying existing technology, cost the City an estimated Pounds 400m. The Booz Allen report is believed to add that Nasdaq, the over-the-counter US share trading system on which London's own Seaq trading system was based in the mid-1980s, would best suit London's needs. The study was commissioned by Barclays de Zoete Wedd, Kleinwort Benson, Smith New Court, UBS and SG Warburg Securities. Between them these are London's biggest marketmakers - firms which undertake to quote firm prices at which they will buy and sell shares - accounting for about 70 per cent of all marketmaking business. Executives from some of the five houses yesterday played down the significance of their unprecedented joint study. They said they were not trying to force the Stock Exchange immediately to abandon its current development, which is being undertaken by Andersen Consulting and has been under way for a year. However, the issue is likely to figure prominently at an exchange board meeting today, called to review the exchange's future for the first time since the decision to abandon Taurus. The chairmen of three of the five big houses sit on the board - Mr Rudi Mueller of UBS, Mr Peter Wilmot-Sitwell of Warburg Securities and Sir Michael Richardson of Smith New Court. The exchange said it was considering the Booz Allen report, but the study did not mean it was planning to halt work on its current development. Work on the Andersen project is believed to have been approved to the end of June. The exchange has consistently argued that its in-house project, the cost of which has been estimated at anything from Pounds 40m to Pounds 75m, is necessary to overhaul its current computer base, which is becoming increasingly expensive. The five securities houses brought in Booz Allen after they became concerned about the potential costs of the Andersen project. Two of them said yesterday there was no reason why the Andersen system should not go ahead, provided the exchange agreed to abandon some of its aspects to reduce costs. The exchange's board is also expected today to agree to contract out the running of Topic, its share price and company news service. Telekurs, the Swiss-based information provider, is believed to be the operator selected to run the system. Survival through a part-exchange, Page 22 Lex, Page 24</p>

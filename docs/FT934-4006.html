			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / French demands threaten trade pact: Last-minute conditions jeopardise Gatt deadline - EU and US agree farm deal France raised the stakes in world trade talks last night by making a settlement conditional on a list of demands which risk jeopardising prospects of meeting the deadline for a deal, just eight days away. The French gambit came as senior US and EU trade negotiators in Brussels struggled to break the deadlock over US demands for access to Europe's film and broadcasting sector and over aircraft subsidies, the last remaining obstacles to a wide-ranging market access package, including agriculture. Mr Alain Juppe, French foreign minister, appealed for calm. 'This is not a war,' he said, 'but the conditions for an agreement are not there.' The impasse forced Sir Leon Brittan, chief EU trade negotiator, and Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, to delay plans to fly to Geneva to press the multilateral General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade negotiations to a successful conclusion by December 15. They hope to arrive today. Mr Peter Sutherland, Gatt director-general, urged the US and EU to wrap up the market access package. 'No further delay is acceptable,' he said. France's demands include tougher EU trade weapons, a call for 'cultural exemption' for its film and TV industry, and a guarantee that French farmers will not have to take any more land out of production. Without satisfaction on all issues, there would be no deal, said Mr Juppe. The all-day negotiating session between Sir Leon and Mr Kantor was marked by hard bargaining and high drama. At one point last night, Sir Leon summoned three French ministers, including Mr Juppe, from a Brussels restaurant in an effort to resolve the audio-visual stand-off. The hard line risks pitting France against Germany. Bonn has hitherto resisted making it easier for the European Commission to take anti-dumping measures and action against unfair traders. Furthermore, inefficient German farmers stand to lose if the price of Gatt food export cuts is lower EU farm prices. The French demands were set out in a letter from Mr Edouard Balladur, prime minister, to Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, and Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, prime minister of Belgium, which holds the rotating EU presidency. Mr Gunther Rexrodt, German economics minister, said French demands were the price exacted for a future Gatt deal. 'I think it goes too far,' he said. British officials objected to the explicit French linkage between a Gatt deal and internal divisions within Europe on trade policy. 'It creates a potential problem,' one said. France's demands revived calls for similar compensation from other EU member states at a parallel meeting of European foreign ministers in Brussels. The meeting will resume today to review a Brittan-Kantor deal. Portugal insisted that US offers on textiles were unacceptable. Dutch and Danish officials warned that billions of Ecus would be needed to 'buy off' countries objecting to Gatt. 'The atmosphere is disastrous,' said a senior Greek official. Spanish ministers said, however, that an EU-US deal was 'virtually nailed down' and that the problems were now 'internal'. Brussels officials said these would be addressed in a series of talks, starting with an 8am meeting today of the Commission, a second EU foreign ministers' meeting, and a possible end-game discussion at the EU summit in Brussels, starting on Friday. The EU-US farm pact agreed in Brussels yesterday does meet several previous French demands. The planned 21 per cent cuts in subsidised food exports shifts from production reference years set in 1986-90 to 1991-92, when output was higher. The cuts will thus bite more slowly early on. The EU will be able to export an extra 8m tonnes of cereals and 350,000 tonnes of beef over the six years. The US has agreed not to question the CAP regime under a 'peace clause' now extended from six to either eight or 10 years. Hopes of multilateral steel agreement dashed, Page 6 Joe Rogaly, Page 16</p>

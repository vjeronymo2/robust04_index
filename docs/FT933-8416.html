			<p>930816 FT  16 AUG 93 / People: Mill quits NCR NCR, one of the top five US computer giants, has lost its UK chairman, Patrick Mill, after 'personal disagreements' between him and the group's European head Joe Stephan. The new UK chairman is Philip Mantle, 43, who has spent the past 25 years working for NCR across the world. He is currently managing director of the company's business in Turkey, having previously held posts in Latin America, the Middle East and Africa. NCR's parent, the US telecoms giant AT&amp;T, is currently battling for a licence to operate in the UK. If it succeeds, NCR's UK sales and marketing team of 1,900 could come in useful. NCR also has two manufacturing plants in the UK, employing 2,300 between them. But both are managed directly from the US and will not be part of Mantle's remit.</p>

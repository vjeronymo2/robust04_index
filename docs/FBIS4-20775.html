			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by K.K. Katyal: "India Will Foil Any </F> Destabilisation Bid"]    [Text] New Delhi, Feb. 21. While giving an optimistic  account of the gains of the recent past in economic and  political areas, the President, Dr. S.D. Sharma, today noted  with concern Pakistan's activities and their fall-out in the  bilateral field. Pakistan's support to terrorism and subversion  in Jammu and Kashmir and its anti-India activities world-wide  had hampered seriously efforts at normalising relations, he said.    In his address to the members of the two Houses of  Parliament, marking the beginning of the Budget session, Dr.  Sharma recalled the Prime Minister's offer of dialogue to  Pakistan, aimed at establishing good-neighbourly relations in  terms of the Shimla Agreement. Bilateral talks had since taken  place, he said, but the stridency of Pakistan's anti-India  statements had grown, -- with its adverse consequences. He  wanted Pakistan to give up its negative approach and reciprocate  India's desire for normalising ties.    The President, obviously, had in mind Pakistan's anti-India  move at the U.N. Human Rights Commission in Geneva as part of  its efforts to internationalise the Kashmir issue, affecting  adversely the process of dialogue.    In a ringing categorical tone, the President observed:  "Jammu  and Kashmir is an inalienable part of India and we shall foil  any attempt to destabilise it either from across the border or  from any other quarter." This was not the first time that such a  statement emanated from the top, but it had a special meaning  now -- as a message to Pakistan in the midst of its stepped-up  campaign to annex the State through devious, dishonest means,  based on the human rights cry.    Dealing with firm steps by police and security forces to  counter terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir, Dr. Sharma said "every  effort is made to see that the maximum restraint is exercised on  the use of force. Whenever there has been any incident  suggesting excessive use of force, an inquiry has been promptly  instituted and action taken." This was meant for those accusing  India of human rights violations.    External relations accounted for a small portion of the  President's address, but were the subject of sharp, specific,  significant formulations. The reference to India's relations  with the U.S., for instance, stressed the positive and not the  negative which, as we know, had led to strains. Dealing with  interaction with the U.S. in several areas, ranging from  education and science and technology to culture and sports, and  cooperation on the issue of a comprehensive test ban treaty, he  said: "The response from the United States to our economic  liberalisation policies had been very positive and the U.S.  investments in India in the last two years were very  substantial. We look forward to working with the United States  towards mutual understanding, including on those issues on which  such understanding needs enhancement. This will reflect the  vibrant democratic and secular ideals of our two countries."    Then there was satisfaction over the course of relationship  with China -- with particular reference to efforts for peace and  tranquillity along the border -- with Russia -- "despite certain  difficulties, cooperation in political, economic, commercial and  other areas was sought to be promoted by both sides" -- the new  era of cooperation with ASEAN, increased economic interaction  with the Gulf countries and the European Union.    As regards the domestic scene, Dr. Sharma referred to steady  progress on all fronts as evidenced by the improved law and  order situation, a record foodgrain output, containment of the  rate of inflation at a single digit level, comfortable foreign  exchange reserves, reduction in the trade gap, buoyancy in  exports, improved performance in essential areas of the  infrastructural sector, and increased inflow of foreign  investment. All these had symbolised and justified "this  emerging optimism.... We have regained our elan internally and  our confidence globally." The gains of last year in Punjab had  been consolidated, he said.    As regards the Ayodhya issue, the President contrasted the  situation at the beginning of last year with that obtaining now.  "There was a great deal of concern over the possible fall-out of  the demolition and the riots that followed. The grim predictions  that were being made have proved wrong. The atmosphere has  improved considerably and we can hope for a lasting solution to  the dispute." The Government, according to him, "would take  appropriate measures in the light of the opinion of the Supreme  Court."    Dealing with economic reforms, the President referred to the  momentum gained since 1991. Still much more needed to be done,  he noted, adding: "The reform is an irreversible and continuous  process and needs to be implemented with determination and  foresight, keeping the responses and circumstances in the  country constantly in view. We shall hasten with care."</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Hector Adorno Ruiz] </F>   [Text] The Office of the Attorney General of the Republic  [PGR] will hold a "Refresher Course in Forensic Chemical  Analysis of Narcotics and Psychotropics," according to an  announcement made by that department yesterday. Its purpose is  to analyze the technology used in recognizing the various  formats of drugs and narcotics, to study the organization of  laboratories for narcotics research, and to examine the  legislation on the subject.    The federal justice institution noted that updating the  expert study of chemical reagents used to identify cocaine,  marijuana, and other drugs is another purpose of the course, to  be held in Mexico City's Independence Auditorium.    The official spokesman for the Attorney General's Office,  Fernando Aguilar, remarked that the meeting would be opened by  the assistant prosecutor for preliminary investigations, Rene  Gonzalez de la Vega. It will be organized by that institution's  General Directorate of Expert Services as well.    He indicated that, during the sessions, both national and  foreign experts will relate their experiences with the use of  reagents and high technology procedures as aids in the  investigations conducted by the Federal Public Prosecutor's  Office. The aim is to achieve a better and more expeditious  prosecution and administration of justice.    He explained that, at the first session, on 25 April, the  specialists will discuss topics relating to the organization of  narcotics laboratories in France and Mexico, and the program for  regionalizing such laboratories, as well as the national dating  of drugs in France. They will also deal with problems involving  the international legislation on chemical precursors.    There will be subsequent discussions on the identification  of  marijuana based on its botanical characteristics, color  reactions, and chromatography techniques, as well as the  identification of its origin. Also to be covered are  hallucinogenic mushrooms and their active principles; cocaine  and its botanical characteristics, origin, and identification  with various chemical reagents; and precursors and analogous  drug substances.    Other topics dealt with will be the identification of  Papaveracea [the poppy family]; opium and its derivatives; and  the analysis of its principal adulterants, derivatives,  intermediate products, and precursors. Before the forum  concludes, speakers will discuss the classification of  psychotropics, pharmacological activity and the General Health  Law, and the identification of amphetamines and their  derivatives, barbiturates, and hypnotic substances. Finally,  there will be a general explanation of the amendments to the  Penal Code relating to this subject.</p>

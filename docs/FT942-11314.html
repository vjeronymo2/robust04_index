			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / UK Local Elections: Rain damps high turnout hopes - Main parties refuse to be cowed / Polling off to sluggish start Yesterday's bad weather weakened the chances of a strong turnout in the local elections. More than half the nation's total electorate had the opportunity to vote in contests for 32 London boroughs, nine Scottish regions and three Scottish island councils - where all councillors faced re-election - and in 36 metropolitan councils and 114 English and four Welsh shire districts where only a third of council seats were contested. In all, around 15,000 candidates ran for about 5,000 seats in the biggest test of public opinion since the general election two years ago. But by late afternoon, the Association of London Authorities said turnout in the capital - where Labour hoped to make several gains - was still low and affected by the bad weather. Partisan posters in London windows remained almost totally absent throughout the campaign, leading many canvassers to fear that the elections had failed to ignite public interest. It was a similar story in Birmingham, where the Tories hoped to take control. Leaden skies and drizzle cloaked Birmingham for most of the day, deterring early polling. The initial impression of party officials was that voting was slow, although not painfully so for local elections. By 5pm, one polling station in Edgbaston, a marginal ward, had drawn in only 250 of a potential 950 voters. The general prediction was that the turnout would be between 35 per cent and 40 per cent. The slow polling was subject to contrary interpretations: either that there was not a massive anti-government protest vote, or that Conservatives were so fed up that they had stayed at home. In London, also, Conservative campaigners wanted a big turnout as they feared their greatest danger lay in usually stalwart Tory voters protesting against the government by staying at home rather than voting for an opposition party. In Croydon, which Labour had made a significant target, Tory campaigners believed the election would be 'won and lost in the last two hours' as their canvassers tried to take residents to the polling stations. All three parties took the risk of predicting that they would do well. Sir Norman Fowler, Tory party chairman, predicted net gains for the party. Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, believed his party would make considerable gains in spite of cautious talk from the party's local government spokesman, Mr Jack Straw, at the beginning of the campaign. Meanwhile, Mr Paddy Ashdown said the Liberal Democrats expected an 'historic breakthrough', with local activists predicting high-profile captures in Kingston and Harrow. Few authorities expected significant logistical problems counting the votes, but Lambeth, a leftwing Labour stronghold in south London, expected to be the last to declare its results. Its chances of a speedy count were hampered by a range of fringe-left candidates, along with candidates styling themselves 'ex-lecturer in community education' and 'official no-nonsense Conservative candidate'. Two London authorities will not even start counting until this morning. Kensington and Chelsea is regarded by Mr Tony Travers, director of the London School of Economics' greater London group as the Conservatives' single safest London stronghold in spite of a small pocket of safe Labour wards in the north of the borough. The other is Westminster, rocked by allegations of political 'gerrymandering' earlier this year. Local Labour politicians have steadfastly refused to predict that they will take the borough because they are scared of raising expectations, but some council officials believe a Labour victory is possible. One Labour campaigner was more sanguine, suggesting that voters would need 'the moral fibre of the angel Gabriel', to vote against the Conservatives in an area with such a low council tax - although the party claims that Westminster's figure is only so low because of favouritism in awarding government grants. Other councils which will not start counting until this morning are Grampian, Orkney, Shetland and Strathclyde in Scotland, and South Cambridgeshire.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seven northern regions in Maritime Kray have formed  an economic union and this, fortunately, has nothing to do with  separatist ideas. On the contrary, the geography and common  economic problems point to the need for a consolidation of  efforts in the interests of the whole of Maritime Kray.    The most urgent task is to shake up the mining and fur  industries in these regions by spring, to protect the  environment, and prevent natural resources being exported. The  organization will be a kind of economic mini-community within  Maritime Kray, which is a Russian Federation subject, and it  will not have any political goals.</p>

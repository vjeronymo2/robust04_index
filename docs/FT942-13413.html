			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / International Company News: Lean year for Japan's stores Japanese department stores suffered continuing pressure on profit margins as consumers shied away from luxury products and turned to discount retailers. The stores have faced mounting direct competition from discount retail outlets specialising in items such as consumer electronics, men's suits, toys and furniture. Mitsukoshi, the most prestigious, reported its second consecutive parent pre-tax loss, for the year ended in February. The retailer, which recorded an operating loss of Y1.2bn (Dollars 11.6m) and an after-tax loss of Y3.3bn, said it posted double-digit losses in sales of its electrical appliance and household products divisions. However, the company will maintain its dividend of Y6 per share. For the full year to next February, it hopes to return to the black with a pre-tax profit of Y2bn on a 1.2 per cent fall in sales, to Y791bn. In spite of its pre-tax profit decline, Takashimaya posted a 33.7 per cent rise in after-tax profits, to Y1.5bn, thanks to asset sales. Operating profits also rose 30.2 per cent to Y9.4bn. The company will cut its annual dividend to Y7.5 from Y10, and has skipped payments of executive bonuses, which totalled Y64m the previous year. For the current year to next February, it expects an 11.1 per cent rise in pre-tax profits, to Y3bn, on a 2.2 per cent fall in sales to Y702bn. For the year to January, Marui saw a 10.7 per cent fall in men's clothing and sports goods sales, while sales of household items fell 7.4 per cent. Financial income was also hit by a fall in interest rates. For the full year to next January, it expects a 12.7 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Y26bn on a 0.6 per cent rise in sales to Y510bn.</p>

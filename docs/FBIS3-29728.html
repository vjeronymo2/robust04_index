Papers here today say this is entirely because the  "civilian"-veiled traitorous "government" of Kim Yong-sam has  denied the principles of independence, peace and great national  unity and obstructed their implementation on unreasonable  grounds.    An analyst of NODONG SINMUN says:    The effectuation of the North-South agreement and the joint  declaration on denuclearization was proclaimed at the sixth  North-South high-level talks February 19, 1992. This was an  epoch-making event which served as a landmark in-moving toward  peace and reunification of the country.    Had both the North and the South fulfilled the documents of  agreement, they would have been able to part with the past  marred by distrust and confrontation, bring about a new epoch of  reconciliation, remove the danger of war and open a bright  horizon of peace and reunification of the country.    The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique, however, pursued the policy  of dependence on outside forces more zealously than its  predecessors and resumed the Team Spirit joint military  maneuvers with the United States under the pretext of "suspicion  surrounding the nuclear development" of the North, the war game  which had been suspended toward the end of the "Sixth Republic."  This was tantamount to declaring its refusal of all dialogues  and its overt nullification of the documents of agreement.    The puppet clique laid hurdles in the way of DPRK-U.S. talks  and completely opened the rice market of South Korea, yielding  to pressure from its U.S. master, though its predecessors had  not dared to do so.    Although the Kim Yong-sam fascist clique cried for "reform"  and "liquidation of the past" it has left intact the "National  Security Law," the "Security Planning Board" and the "Secret  Affairs Command," turning South Korea into a grave of human  rights and democracy. It has broken up the dialogue and  cooperation between the authorities of North and South which had  been held in the period of the "Fifth and Sixth Republics"  dictatorship and blocked nongovernmental dialogue and contact.    Since the traitor Kim Yong-sam took office in South Korea,  the acts of flunkeyism, treachery, fascism, confrontation and  war have become more undisguised and vicious, the people's  desire for independence, democracy and reunification has been  put down, the documents of agreement between the North and the  South have been reduced to waste paper, dialogues have collapsed  and the situation has become worse than in the days before the  adoption of the North- South agreement.    As long as such traitor as Kim Yong-sam is left alone,  neither reconciliation and unity of the nation nor the peace and  reunification of the country can be achieved and only  confrontation and war will befall.    The anti-national, anti-reunification group forsaken by the  people must be overthrown.    An analyst of MINJU CHOSON says:    The Kim Yong-sam puppet government is a stumbling block in  the way of reunification. If the cause of national  reunification is to be promoted, the block must be removed  resolutely.</p>

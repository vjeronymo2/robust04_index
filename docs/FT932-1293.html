			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Letter: Lloyd's reserves have been built up by shearing the sheep Sir, If J P Morgan and Marsh McLennan are planning to make significant investments from their Dollars 1bn insurance fund in the Lloyd's market ('Dollars 1bn Morgan and Marsh fund will invest in Lloyd's', June 19), they must think that despite the haemorrhage of cash that its Names are suffering, Lloyd's is well-reserved. If so the source of these generous reserves can only be that very haemorrhage. A proportion of the losses that some Lloyd's syndicates are now reporting are no more than the counterpart of the unearned dividends they declared in the early and mid-1980s to give a false impression of profitability in order to suck in more Names. The dividends were unearned because the syndicates were under-reserved. Had reserves been debited to each year's revenue at prudent rates, then the true position, that many syndicates had been trading unprofitably for years, would have been revealed and there would have been no new members and an exodus of existing ones. By declaring swingeing losses now (using as 'cover' the well-publicised catastrophe losses elsewhere in the market) these syndicates can build up their reserves quickly by shearing the sheep who flocked to join or were induced to stay by the illusory profits of the early and mid-1980s and who are now resigning. In some cases the fleeces that they are leaving behind consist of their homes and their life savings. The magnitude of this build-up can be judged from the fact that at the end of the 1987 year of account Lloyd's global reserves (measured by the reinsurance to close the year) were Pounds 5.5bn; at the end of 1990, the year that has just closed, the reserves had nearly doubled at Pounds 10.85bn. In 1990 itself on this measure the reserves grew by Pounds 1.75bn, accounting for the largest part of the Pounds 2.9bn loss declared. To the extent that these Names are recapitalising those syndicates with their remaining assets it seems inequitable that the Lloyd's business plan should make no provision to give them any benefit from it. By the same token Lloyd's becomes all the more attractive to J P Morgan and Marsh McLennan. Alfred Doll-Steinberg, 18 Holly Walk, London NW3 6RA</p>

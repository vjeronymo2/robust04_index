			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Creating a network for investors - In A Nutshell Private individuals invest many times more in small businesses than the formal venture capital sector in the US. But efforts to create a similar investors' network in the UK have had only very limited success. A new attempt to form such a network has come in the shape of The Capital Exchange, a members-only organisation which publishes CX Monthly, a newsletter to help investors find businesses seeking finance and businesses seeking joint venture partners. The organisers, a group of Hereford businessmen headed by Nigel Lacy, a former bank manager, plan to launch a scheme for syndicating private equity investments later this year. Contact The Capital Exchange, Wyvern Centre, Barrs Court Road, Hereford HR1 1EG. Annual membership Pounds 60.</p>

"It will promote Japan's economic recovery as well," he  said.    The prime minister said be believed Foreign Minister Tsutomu  Hata's visit to Beijing last month helped boost bilateral ties.    Zhu agreed that the relationship has been solidified in both  quantity and quality, according to the ministry officials.

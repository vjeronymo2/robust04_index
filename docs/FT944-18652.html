			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / Crackdown on Criminal Trading: Surveillance knights ride into battle to secure fair fight for all investors 1.1 On February 6 1994, Olde Humbugs, the manufacturer of traditional English confectionery, put out a statement that it was in talks with International Chocolate Bars (ICB), the Swiss-based foods multinational, which were likely to lead to a merger of the two companies. 1.2 Following the announcement, Olde Humbug's share price jumped 40p to 270p. At the beginning of the year, the price had been 220p. 1.3 The Surveillance Group initiated a review of trading in Olde Humbug's shares as it had been seen that there were a series of large transactions ahead of the announcement. A substantial number of trades had come from Scottish-based individuals and had taken place through an Edinburgh stockbroking firm, McNose and Partners. These transactions, most of them purchases, seemed anomalous, since McNose had rarely in the past dealt in Olde Humbugs shares. 1.4 The biggest purchases, worth Pounds 10m in aggregate, were carried out by McNose for two clients, Banque Internationale de Bruxelles, a Brussels-based bank, and Mr Peter Punter, a well-known and successful private investor. The investigation 2.1 The department approached the Takeover Panel for information, given in strictest confidence, about how long talks had been in progress between ICB and Olde Humbugs. The two companies were also asked to supply timetables of the events leading up to the announcement and who had been aware of the negotiations. 2.2 Both companies agreed that the first significant event took place on November 14 1993 when the chairmen of the two companies, Mr Ronald Chattie (Olde Humbugs) and Mr Dieter Aufgang (ICB) met to explore the issue of a possible merger. 2.3 On March 1, Chattie and Aufgang were interviewed separately at the exchange. Both were taped. During the interviews, the names of those identified at that date as having dealt prior to the merger announcement were given to them, but none was known to either. They agreed to carry out checks with their personnel records and suppliers. 2.4 The department carried out a more extensive review of transactions in both companies' shares. On March 3 it established that Mr Ewan Side, an Olde Humbug executive, had dealt in his company's shares as follows: November 15 1993, bought 5,000 shares at 215p; January 18 1994, bought 5,000 shares at 222p; February 10 1994, sold 10,000 shares at 280p. 2.5 Although not a member of the Olde Humbugs board, he was aware of the merger talks because of his role as corporate strategist. 2.6 On March 10 two exchange investigators met Chattie and Ron Desktop, his finance director, at Olde Humbug's offices in Leicester. The purpose of the meeting was to find out the nature of Side's involvement in the talks with ICB. Chattie said Side as corporate strategist was kept closely informed of the talks with ICB and was present at several of the negotiating meetings. He recalled that in early December he warned Side not to buy any shares. Side had not been brought onside (made an insider) in any other transaction as this was the first time the company had been in merger discussions. Chattie said he did not feel uncomfortable about discussing the business with him. Chattie had also checked the company's records against the names of Olde Humbugs share purchasers mentioned at the original meeting in the exchange. He had found that Bernard Arrowroot of Gumme Group was a supplier to Arthur Crystal of Sugar Products which in turn was a supplier to Olde Humbugs. Arrowroot had purchased 10,000 Olde Humbug shares in January. Chattie said that he knew that Side and Crystal were friends and had been shooting together in December. 2.6 Owing to the senior position of Side within the company and the information supplied by Chattie, it was felt necessary to interview Side at the earliest opportunity. It was therefore decided to interview him the next morning. 2.7 On March 11 at 09.05, two exchange investigators met Side at Olde Humbug's offices. They explained the purpose of wanting to speak to him and that he might wish to consider speaking to his solicitor before continuing. Side left at 9.16, returned at 9.25 and informed them that his solicitor would be attending any interview. At 10.11 Side returned and introduced his solicitor, who said he had advised his client to co-operate fully. At 10.15 the interview, which was taped, commenced. Following introductions, Side was cautioned. The first tape ended at 10.45. The second tape commenced at 10.46 and concluded at 11.01. Side confirmed that he had dealt in Olde Humbug's shares as identified by the surveillance department. He denied being told of the bid approach prior to his purchase of 5,000 shares on November 15. The reason given for the purchase was that Crystal, an old friend, had recently joined Sugar Products and he hoped that they would be able to work together in developing and expanding commercial links between the two companies. Side admitted that the purchase on 18 January of 5,000 shares at 14.14 was prompted by his being told by Chattie that a deal with ICB was likely. He said he did not know if the information was public. He denied discussing the bid talks with anyone outside the company. He confirmed he had been shooting with Crystal in December. The names of other people who had dealt were put to him. He said Punter had been in the same shooting party as Crystal and himself, although they had not previously been acquainted and they talked little during the weekend. Side said the deals were tiny in comparison to his portfolio of Pounds 3m invested in the stockmarket. At the end of the interview, he was handed a notice explaining how he could get access to the tapes. His solicitors were supplied with a copy of the tapes on April 10. 2.8 In the light of Side's admission that he had bought because of the information he had obtained from Chattie, it was decided to attempt to establish the conduit of any other information to the suspicious dealers in Scotland and also in particular to Punter and Banque Internationale de Bruxelles. The department then wrote to the Belgian bank asking for whom it had bought the Olde Humbugs shares. The bank supplied the name of a Liechtenstein-based stiftung or trust. A letter was sent to the trust requesting details of its beneficiary. 2.9 An apparent link from Olde Humbug to Punter was Crystal, who agreed to be met at a hotel in Glasgow on April 5. He was interviewed there at 16.15. He confirmed he knew Side both socially and through business. He said he was not told that Olde Humbug was considering merging with ICB. Crystal freely admitted that he recommends ICB's shares as he thinks it is a good business, but he was adamant he had not heard about any merger activity. He confirmed that Arrowroot of Gumme was one of his more important suppliers. He was also asked if he had heard of Punter. He said he knew him and dealt with him on business matters. He described him as someone who would buy and sell anything. He knew that Punter was very active on the stockmarket as every time he went to Punter's office he was always on the telephone to his broker. Punter was well aware of Crystal's relationship with Olde Humbug and frequently asked how the company was doing. Crystal has recommended Olde Humbug's shares to Punter. 2.10 On April 15, Chattie telephoned the department to say that he had become convinced that Side had breached his trust. During this conversation it was established that Side had resigned following advice from his lawyer. Conclusion 3.1 There is evidence of insider dealing by Side and consideration should be given to referring this matter to the DTI. The large transactions by the various connected dealers in Scotland and those of the Liechtenstein trust may also be of interest. Punter has been interviewed by this department on previous occasions. No attempt has been made to interview him this time.</p>

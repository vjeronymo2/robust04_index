			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / Germany to outlaw insider dealing GERMANY is to outlaw insider dealing and introduce a central supervisory body for the securities industry, the Finance Ministry said yesterday. It is expected the amendment to the existing securities law could be in place by the year-end. Such a law and the creation of a supervisory body are regarded as essential steps on the way to strengthening Germany as a financial centre. These proposals were central to a policy document published last January by Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister. This outlined a package of measures designed to enhance the German financial markets' competitive position. It was originally intended that they would be in place by the end of 1992. The lack of an insider law is particularly embarrassing for Germany as the European Community directive on this issue should have been implemented by member states by last summer. The image of Frankfurt as a financial centre was tarnished after a series of insider dealing scandals in 1991. Frankfurt financiers dispute the seriousness of the scandals but accept the need to make such dealing a criminal offence and to toughen the regulatory environment. The lack of a national supervisory body has made it difficult for Germany to conduct negotiations with similar bodies from other countries, and so hampered German companies and financial institutions. Germany's Lander (state) governments are responsible for supervising the securities markets in their respective territories. Over the past year regional ministers have been meeting behind the scenes to discuss details of the proposals. Frankfurt bourse, Page 27</p>

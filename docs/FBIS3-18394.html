			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [The "Views" column: "Playing With Fire"] </F>   [Text] A U.S. air raid takes place under NATO auspices and  four aircraft are downed just when peace efforts are developing  to stop the bloodshed in Bosnia and find a political solution to  defuse the crisis.    Just when the Serbs, given an ultimatum, are complying and  are withdrawing their heavy weapons from the besieged Sarajevo,  they find themselves accused of "having violated the no-fly  zone." However, such violations take place continuously.  Therefore, yesterday's flights could be used only as a pretext  for the strike.    At the time when everybody is in agony and fears an  expansion  of the war in the Balkans with more general implications, they  are dangerously playing with fire, which could undermine and  upset the entire peace effort.    It is obvious that the Americans want to promote their own  solution within the framework of the "new order." The solution  of missiles and the superpower's strength.    So, it is reasonable that there is concern in all the  capitals of the countries that are participating in the peace  efforts, including Athens, which has additional reasons to be  concerned since it is within the explosive zone.    The solution to the drama of Bosnia will not be given by  missiles and air raids but by the peace efforts, without any  undermining actions under the table.    Hope to God that there will be no continuation and  escalation  of tension after this incident. Hope to God that things are not  led again into a deadlock and war entanglement.    The "new order" has shown its face once again. It has shown  that it does not hesitate to stir up tension without considering  the consequences.    It has shown that its basic argument at every peace dialogue  is the persuasion of arms.</p>

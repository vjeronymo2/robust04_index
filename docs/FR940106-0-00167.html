			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (4)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Section 236(a)(4) of the Act. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (i)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> In general. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (A) Paragraph (4) of section 236(a) of the Act (paragraph (3) of section 236(a) before August 23, 1988) continues to provide, as it did before the addition of paragraphs (5)(E), (6), and (7) to section 236(a), that: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) When the costs of training are paid from TAA funds under subpart C of this part, no other payment for such costs of training may be made under any other Federal law; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) When the payment of the costs of training has already been made under any other Federal law, or the costs are reimbursable under any other Federal law and a portion of the costs has already been paid under such other Federal law, payment of such training costs may not be made from TAA funds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) Paragraph (4) of section 236(a) also requires that: The provisions of paragraphs (b)(4)(i) (A)( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) and (A)( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) of this section shall not apply to, or take into account, any funds provided under any other provision of Federal law which are used for any purpose other than the direct payment of the identical costs incurred in training the adversely affected worker under the TAA Program, even if such other use has the effect of indirectly paying or reducing any portion of the costs involved in training the adversely affected worker. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Application. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (A) Although the prohibition on duplicate payments in the first part of section 236(a)(4) remains fully implemented in this section, the second part of section 236(a)(4) on the sharing of costs from TAA funds and other Federal fund sources is modified by the explicit provisions of paragraphs (5)(E) and (6) of section 236(a), as set forth in paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) When the direct costs of a training program approvable under subpart C of this part are payable from TAA funds and are also wholly or partially payable under another Federal law, or under any State law or from private, nongovernmental sources, the TAA Program agencies shall establish procedures which ensure that TAA funds shall not be utilized to duplicate funds available from another source, but this preclusion of duplication does not prohibit and shall not discourage sharing of costs under prearrangements authorized under paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C)( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) Therefore, pursuant to paragraph (4) of section 236(a), paragraph (b)(4) of this section continues to prohibit duplicate payment of training costs, which is consistent with the general prohibition expressed in subpart C of this part, against any use of TAA funds to duplicate payment of training costs in any circumstances. Paragraph (b)(4) of this section also continues to prohibit taking into account, in determining whether training costs are payable from TAA funds, any payments to the worker under any other Federal law which may have the effect of indirectly paying all or a portion of the training costs. Such indirect payments include Veterans Educational Assistance, Pell Grants, and Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants, which are paid to the individual. However, any payments to the individual under these programs are deductible from TRA payable to the individual under &sect;617.13(c)(2). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) When payments of Veterans Educational Assistance, Pell Grants, and Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants are made to the training provider, instead of the individual, and are used for training costs, such payments shall be taken into account as direct payment of the training costs under other Federal law for the purposes of this section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Section 236(a)(7) of the Act. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (i)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> In general. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Paragraph (7) of section 236(a) of the Act provides that a training program shall not be approved under the Act if_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) all or a portion of the costs of such training program are paid under any nongovernmental plan or program, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) the adversely affected worker has a right to obtain training or funds for training under such plan or program, and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) such plan or program requires the worker to reimburse the plan or program from funds provided under the Act, or from wages paid under such training program, for any portion of the costs of such training program paid under the plan or program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Application. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Paragraph (7) of section 236(a), which is implemented in paragraph (b)(5) of this section, reinforces the prohibition in &sect;617.22(h) against approval of a training program under subpart C of this part if the worker is required to pay a fee or tuition. The provisions of paragraph (b) and paragraph (h) of this section shall be given effect as prohibiting the approval under subpart C of this part of any training program if the worker would be requested or required, at any time or under any circumstances, to pay any of the costs of a training program, however small, from any TAA funds given to the worker or from any other funds belonging to the worker from any source whatever. Aside from this stringent limitation, however, paragraph (7) of section 236(a) of the Act implicitly authorizes training approved under this subpart C to be wholly or partly funded from nongovernmental (i.e., employer, union or other private) sources. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 19. Section 617.26 is revised to read as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;617.26 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Liable and agent State responsibilities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Liable State. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The liable State means, for any individual, the State which administers the applicable State law (as determined under &sect;617.16).

Agent State responsibilities include cooperating with liable States in taking applications and claims for TAA, providing reemployment services to certified workers in accordance with subparts B, C, D and E of this part, providing interstate claimants with TAA program information and assistance, assisting applicants or claimants to file claims for TAA program benefits and services, cooperating with the liable State by providing information needed to issue determinations, redeterminations, and decisions on appeals, and procuring and paying the cost of any approved training, including subsistence and transportation costs, according to determinations issued by the liable State. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 20.

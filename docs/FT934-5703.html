			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Telecoms outsourcing 'rejected' More than 90 per cent of large companies have rejected the idea of contracting out telecommunications, says an industry survey published today. The Telecommunications Managers Association survey casts a shadow over the strategies of British Telecommunications and Mercury to generate a multi-billion-pound business from the 'outsourcing' of company telecommunications requirements. BT in particular is seeking to develop a market for international outsourcing through the Dollars 5.3bn (Pounds 3.6bn) alliance it forged this summer with MCI, the second-largest US long-distance carrier. The survey of 439 large companies reveals that only 6 per cent have decided to outsource the management of their telecommunications. Fewer than half of the companies had considered outsourcing. Of those which had considered it, 45 per cent said they had rejected it because telecommunications were strategic to their business, while 44 per cent could see no cost benefit. Nearly one in four feared 'entrapment' by the outsourcer. Mr Graham Marriner, chairman of the association, said: 'Most large companies still see telecoms as a core activity, and are very reluctant to describe their requirements in detail to a third party.' The survey underlines the divide between US and European practice. In the US the market for telecommunications outsourcing is large and growing. In most of Europe it remains modest.

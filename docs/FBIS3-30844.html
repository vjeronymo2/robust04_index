It does not offer direct national security  guarantees," Bulgarian Defence Minister Valentin Aleksandrov  said at a workshop on national security here. "But the  initiative promotes mutual confidence and its better for us to  join it than to remain outside. This is my personal view," the  defence minister added.    "While Central and Western Europe may be facing no danger  for  an armed conflict, there are a number of high-risk factors in  the Balkans," Chief of General Staff of the Bulgarian Army Army  General Lyuben Petrov said at this workshop. He believes that  international guarantees and bilateral treaties will therefore  continue to play a key role for this country's national  security. "The truth is that most of our neighbours are  rearming and increasing their armies' strength," General Petrov  also said. He went on to cite the military budgets Greece,  Turkey and Romania have allocated -- over 8,000 million U.S.  dollars, 600,000 million Greek drachmas, and 500 million U.S.  dollars respectively -- which, according to the speaker, come to  prove his observations.    Compared to those figures, the Bulgarian Army will just  survive to the year's end if parliament passes the military  budget bill, General Lyuben Petrov also said. Aside from these,  the Bulgarian Army will need more funds to launch the military  reform and join Partnership for Peace, according to the  Bulgarian chief of General Staff.</p>

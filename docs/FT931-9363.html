			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / EC maps a path for steel's contraction LAST October, the European Community's largest steelmakers called for financial, commercial and political help from the EC authorities. Hit by overcapacity, recession and cheap non-EC imports, the industry warned of 'catastrophe', if the Community did not support it under the Treaty of Paris  - protector of the European steel and coal industries since 1951, and foundation of the modern Community. Five months later, the situation in the EC steel industry has changed. The main steel producers have finally begun to cut production and raise prices. But Community action is still seen as essential. A special report submitted to the Commission a week ago by Mr Fernand Braun, the EC's 'steel envoy', records 70 steelmakers' warning that the situation is still worsening and could have repercussions for other sectors. This week, the European Commission is poised to deliver a detailed response to last October's plea. This outline plan will be discussed by a special council of EC industry ministers on February 25. 'We hope we can convince the council to produce a resolution with the main elements in it,' said one senior Commission official. The cautious Euro-speak is deliberate. This is one of the most sensitive issues that the Commission has had to handle since the beginning of the recession. Under such circumstances, it is difficult enough to forge agreement on 'resolutions' and 'outline plans', let alone reach unanimity on formal proposals and legally binding decisions. Details of the Commission's initiative began to emerge last week: Aid. As suggested in its initial response to the industry's requests, the Commission is trying to whip together Ecu240m (Pounds 195m) to help cover redundancy and closure costs, on top of Ecu210m already committed. Before they can release those funds, however, Mr Martin Bangemann, the EC industry commissioner, and Mr Karel Van Miert, responsible for competition, will have to convince member states to provide the same amount. At the same time, the Commission is likely to support attempts by groups of steelmakers to pool financial resources to assist specific sectors. Officials admit that the funds likely to be on offer to the industry are small, compared with the amounts needed to fund overall restructuring of the industry. The Braun report suggests a total cost over the next three years of perhaps Ecu6bn, of which Ecu2.5bn would cover the cost of cutting at least 50,000 jobs. Market supervision. Under the terms of the Treaty of Paris, the Commission seems prepared to issue quarterly 'recommendations' for forward production and delivery volumes in specific sectors across the whole Community. External measures. This is the only part of the plan which has yet to be clarified, but the Commission has pledged to improve protection against cheap non-EC imports, notably from eastern Europe. Sir Leon Brittan, EC external trade commissioner, will have to suggest how this could be done. Restructuring. The industry has already started to reduce capacity, but the Commission will approve other measures only if steelmakers come up with firm closure plans by the end of September, which could be carried out by the end of 1994. According to the Braun report, steelmakers may be able, but not necessarily willing to cut up to 25.8m tonnes in crude steel capacity, and 17.9m tonnes in rolled products. The aim of the Commission is to persuade steelmakers and member states to endorse this balanced, overall plan at the same time. If a number of large steelmakers, or an individual member state steps out of line - either by refusing to make capacity cuts, or by granting large illegal subsidies to its own industry -  then the fear is that others may follow suit. Spain, for example, is still wrestling with a controversial plan to subsidise additional steel-making capacity in the volatile Basque region of the country, in return for capacity cuts elsewhere. The Commission, which has suggested more capacity should be cut, or the aid reduced, hopes Madrid will accept that other countries are being forced to make similar sacrifices. The Commission is also worried that it may again be cast in the role of organising the EC steel market. That is broadly what happened in the 1980s, when, under the plan named after the then industry commissioner, Mr Etienne Davignon, the Commission was allowed to dictate individual company's production quotas, impose protectionist trade measures, and endorse subsidies and industry cartels. This time, according to the Commission, individual companies will only receive overall guidelines on production volumes, and, in any case, will have to commit themselves to closure programmes before any of the rescue package is implemented. If necessary, officials say, Mr Braun will act as 'father confessor' to the producers, but otherwise Brussels believes steelmakers should be able to moderate their output along their guidelines without collaborating. Informal cartels will be punished, they add. The industry, on the other hand, says this is one area where there may have to be further negotiation with the Commission. If the Commission and industry ministers cannot agree on the way forward in the next fortnight, then the steel industry may try to put further pressure on the authorities by calling for the so-called 'manifest crisis' clause of the Treaty of Paris to be activated. The Davignon Plan was founded on this article of the treaty, but Mr Van Miert and Mr Bangemann are opposed to its use. Eurofer, the steelmakers' federation, is also resisting calls from some members to press for more intervention by the authorities. But industry sources are beginning to echo the comments of one British Steel executive when the same dilemma was being discussed in 1980: 'I don't know whether there is a 'manifest crisis' or not, but I can tell you: there is manifestly a crisis.'</p>

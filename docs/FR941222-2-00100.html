Cinquemani; by letter dated October 25, 1994, the Toledo Coalition for Safe Energy; and by letter dated October 26, 1994, R. Benjan (Petitioners) request that the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) take action with regard to the use of Thermo-Lag by all reactor licensees and that their letters be treated as Petitions pursuant to &sect;2.206 of Title 10 of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Code of Federal Regulations  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (10 CFR).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Dr. Cinquemani and Toledo Coalition for Safe Energy request that the NRC immediately shut down all reactors where Thermo-Lag is used until it has been removed and replaced. GE Stockholders' Alliance requests shutdown of all reactors where Thermo-Lag is used until it has been removed and replaced with fire-retardant material meeting NRC standards. R. Benjan requests immediate shutdown of all reactors where Thermo-Lag is used.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As the bases for their requests, the Petitioners state, either individually or collectively, that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) the widespread use of Thermo-Lag, in more than 70 reactors, presents a safety crisis;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) the NRC has known since 1982 that Thermo-Lag fails NRC performance standards for material that protects vital electrical cables for ampacity rating and fire resistance;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Thermo-Lag has failed not only NRC tests, but almost all other independent tests;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Thermo-Lag is combustible, contrary to NRC regulations, and is an ineffective fire barrier;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) the use of Thermo-Lag could lead to shorts, to failure of the cables in an emergency, and to fire;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Thermo-Lag is faulty in that fraudulent ampacity ratings allowed utilities to use smaller cable than permitted by design requirements, causing the cable to overheat and its insulation to deteriorate;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) the NRC has stated that fire at some nuclear power plants can contribute as much as 50 percent of the risk to a core meltdown, and a typical reactor will have three to four significant fires during its licensed lifetime;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8) Thermal Science, Inc., the manufacturer of Thermo-Lag, and its president were indicted by Federal grand jury on seven criminal charges related to conspiracy to defraud the U.S. Government in regard to the effectiveness of Thermo-Lag; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (9) the hourly fire watches at the Davis-Besse Nuclear Power plant operated by Toledo Edison do not replace fire barrier material and do not prevent fires.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Petitions are being treated pursuant to 10 CFR 2.206 of the Commissions regulations and have been referred to the Director of the Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation. As provided by 10 CFR 2.206, appropriate action will be taken on these petitions within a reasonable time. By letter dated December 15, 1994, the Director denied the requests of GE Stockholders' Alliance, Dr. Cinquemani, Toledo Coalition for Safe Energy, and R. Benjan for immediate suspension of the operating licenses of all reactors where Thermo-Lag is used.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Copies of the Petitions are available for inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room at 2120 L Street, NW, Washington, DC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 15th day of December 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> William T.

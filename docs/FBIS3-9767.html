Mr. Arbnori told the Danish delegation about the composition  and work of the new pluralistic parliament for the realisation  of the reform both in the legislative and economic fields. We  are convinced that we may have mistakes during the economic  reform we are carrying out but some of them are artificially  created by the opposition, Mr. Arbnori said. He illustrated his  statement with the hindrances that the parliamentary commission  charged with the preparation of the draft of the constitution  ins encountering. Through these hindrances, the opposition aims  at bringing Albania back where it was, in a neocommunist  dictatorship, as it is happening somewhere in Eastern Europe,  Mr. Arbnori said.    Mr. Petersen asked further information about the law on the  distribution of the land in the countryside, the efforts for the  new constitution, the resources of Albania and the system of  taxes applied in this country.    Mr. Petersen said that in the context of a three year plan  for the Eastern and Central European countries, Denmark has  accorded Albania a considerable financial aid.</p>

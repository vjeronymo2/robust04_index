They believe bureaucrats in Brussels are  more accessible and sympathetic than their own Government.    Frustrated by the way in which government departments delay  or refuse to support pet schemes, the regions are increasingly  pleading their case directly with the European Commission  instead of waiting for what they regard as half-hearted help by  Whitehall.    Regional power has been recognised and strengthened by the  Maastricht Treaty which set up a Committee of the Regions with  the duty to advise and consult the Commission. The first  meeting takes place next month and many of the 24 British  representatives joined a Commission conference in Lincolnshire  last week to discuss tactics and hear complaints from local  organisations about central government.    Philip Jagger, of the TUC's [Trade Union Congress] Yorkshire  regional council, summed up feelings. "We can hardly find  anyone in Government to listen to us in London these days but in  Brussels they are always prepared to give us time and help," he  said.    William Newton Dunn, Conservative MEP [Member of the  European  Parliament] for Lincolnshire, agreed. "If you put things  through the British Government then you will often find it sells  you down the river," he said. "They do their best to balance  things but they are more concerned about achieving something  else."    Scotland and Wales, with their clear regional identities,  have led the way in Brussels where the "Tartan Mafia" and the  "Taffia" [Welsh mafia] are recognised within the Commission.  They have their own offices in Brussels and their example has  been followed in England by the North West, the West Midlands  and Kent. Britain's nine other regions, designated after the  Maastricht Treaty, are being actively encouraged to set up their  own Brussels operations. Treasury sources at the conference  urged delegates to learn quickly how to pull their weight. With  Britain a net contributor of 2 billion pounds a year to the  Community budget, the Treasury does not want to waste any chance  of "getting our money back."    "This is subsidiarity in action," one official said. In the  short term these offices are likely to be more effective than  the Council of the Regions, which has no powers yet and only a  tiny budget. However, local authority representatives at the  conference were determined that it must quickly win influence  and power in Brussels to fight for their interests.    "Whitehall seems happy for Europe to deal with the regional  management of wildfowl but then it wants to do everything else  itself," Tony Davies, of Yorkshire and Humberside regional  association, said.    Britain nevertheless is lagging behind much of the Community  in regional lobbying. Each German state has a Brussels office  which operates almost like a national representative, lobbying  for local interests, winning contracts for local firms and  claiming every scrap of Community aid available. England's lack  of clear regions has made it more difficult to organise.    A Foreign Office source assured delegates that the  Government  had "an underlying commitment and excitement about Europe." But  he gave a warning against too much expectation and enthusiasm  for the next moves towards European integration.</p>

Lambeck report: "Hintze Wants To Focus on Jobs in </F> Election Campaign"]    [Text] Bonn -- In an interview with DIE WELT, Peter  Hintze, secretary general of the Christian Democratic Union  [CDU], noted a "worldwide tendency toward change" among the  governments -- irrespective of the orientation of the  governments.    In view of the worldwide recession, voters in the United  States, Japan, or Greece act according to the following slogan:  "Let us try the opposition."    Elections in Great Britain and Spain were exceptions.  "There, the population considered the risk of a change to be  too high." Hintze added: "This also applies to Germany. We  will intensify the risk awareness during the election campaign.  In view of the readiness among the population for change,  Hintze supports a strategy that advocates the required political  changes."    Thus, the CDU must offer factual and emotional arguments in  the field of the economy and jobs during the election campaign,  Hintze demanded. For this reason, the CDU wants to present its  concept for growth and employment on the first day of its party  congress in Hamburg.    Hintze stressed: "Foreign and security policy is an  important area for the CDU/Christian Social Union [CSU] where it  has a clear lead over the Social Democratic Party of Germany  [SPD]. However, foreign and security issues alone are not  sufficient for an election campaign." The CDU official referred  warningly to the election campaign of former U.S. President  George Bush against his challenger Bill Clinton. Bush mainly  concentrated on foreign and security issues. The Democrats and  Bill Clinton, however, focused on jobs. "The major topic in  Germany is jobs, too," Hintze pointed out.    Thus, the CDU/CSU "must present new ideas for the economy  and  the employment situation" in the super election year 1994.  Hintze stressed: "With Helmut Kohl, we must create prospects  for the future at a time of great insecurity and worldwide  changes."    "It is not enough to simply attack the Social Democrats. The  citizens expect us to develop clear prospects for the future  during the election campaign."    In this respect, the voters must be convinced that the SPD  is  no alternative to the Bonn coalition. Hintze stated: "Risking  an alliance between the SPD and the Greens means endangering the  economy and jobs."</p>

Troops of Burma's ruling State Law and Order Council (SLORC)  "resumed their offensive against the Karen National Union on  December 29," said KNU spokesman Arthur Shwe. He described the  clashes as "fierce." "Casualties on both sides are not yet  known," he said.    The fighting resumed as an attempt this month at political  dialogue between the SLORC and opposition groups appeared to  have aborted, political analysts said.    Burmese troops launched their assault on KNU positions  around  Saw Hta, about 120 kilometers (75 miles) north of Mannerplaw,  the Karen headquarters and that of the Burmese opposition in  exile, bordering Thailand.    It is the first major offensive ordered by the SLORC since  January and is spearheaded by light infantry battalions 319 and  314 and No. 227 Regiment, said the Karen spokesman. It involves  around 1,000 men, said Shwe.    "Fighting was still going on last night" said the spokesman  who was receiving information from Mannerplaw.    The Karens, the second largest ethnic group after the  Burmese, are mostly Christians and have been fighting for  independence from Rangoon since 1947 when the former British  colony became independent.    Concentrated largely in the south-east of the country, the  Karens control large tracts of territory along the Thai border  area.    In November the Burma Democratic Alliance, which groups  about  20 opposition movements, met in Mannerplaw and agreed to try a  dialogue with the SLORC.    But the SLORC refused to talk through the alliance and said  it would only dialogue with the opposition movements  individually.</p>

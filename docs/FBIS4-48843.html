			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Studio interview with Prime Minister-Designate Faustin </F> Twagiramungu by unidentified correspondent -- live]    [Text] [Twagiramungu] Good afternoon.    [Correspondent] You are the prime minister appointed after  the Arusha Agreement. You are now in France to hold talks with  French officials. Mr. Twagiramungu, what do you think about the  statement UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali made  yesterday evening? The UN secretary general was really desperate  and worried by the situation in your country.    [Twagiramungu] It is true, the UN secretary general is  saddened by what is going on in my country, Rwanda. But I think  that we should not be as discouraged and worried as he is. The  Rwandan people must know that the situation in our country is a  Rwandan problem. We Rwandans must try by all means to find a  viable solution so that peace is restored.    [Correspondent] We will come back to this point, but do you  agree with Butrus Butrus-Ghali who says that the international  community has failed because it has done nothing?    [Twagiramungu] I do agree because I think that what is going  on in Rwanda is quite a scandal. It raises questions about the  sensibility of people and about our sense of humanity. This  massacre--which is actually being called a genocide  today...[pauses] We cannot understand how people are not worried  by what is going on and do not want to find a solution. Today  we are talking about genocide. It is not only a word today. We  have had UNAMIR [UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda] 1; we are now  waiting for UNAMIR 2. But we do not see the international  community reacting positively. This is why--when you see what  is going on in Rwanda--I think it is a failure and a shameful  thing for the international community.    [Correspondent] What do you think of the special  investigator  appointed to investigate the massacres for four weeks?    [Twagiramungu] I think that it is just the first step. Quite  frankly I must admit that I am absolutely not satisfied with  that. I am not the only one by the way. With such a genocide,  we cannot avoid setting up an international court to try and  punish the criminals. I do not see any difference between what  is happening in Rwanda and what happened in Germany between 1940  and 1945. There was a genocide there, there were serious  problems there, similar to ours. Why cannot the international  community set up an international court to judge these  criminals. Moreover, if they are not tried they will think that  they can continue and resume the massacres in some years' time.  This is why we will lobby the international community so that  the court is set up. That will be the beginning of the  solution. Otherwise, we will encourage the killers.    [Correspondent] There has been talk of sending 5,500 UN  troops to Rwanda, but they have not been found yet.  Nobody--almost nobody--wants to send troops.    [Twagiramungu] I personally think that they do not want to.  It is as if they were saying: Look, it is a small country,  there are massacres and there is genocide. We must not get  involved and we are not interested in that. They should be  allowed to continue until they stop. As I told you before, it  is a huge failure and we are disappointed.    [Correspondent] This is what you really feel?    [Twagiramungu] This is what I feel. The international  community should understand that there are serious problems.  People have been killing each other for almost two months, and  the killers are left to do what they want. We must employ all  available means to stop the killers.    [Correspondent] Let us now talk about the situation there  and about the war. There are massacres and there is war. Is  there something else that could be done other than a military  solution? We have the feeling that the RPF [Rwanda Patriotic  Front] is gaining ground.    [Twagiramungu] Yes, the RPF is gaining ground. It has always  put forward conditions to end the war and the massacres. Let us  talk about the massacres first. These are two different things.  The massacres were started by the regular army and in  particular, by the Presidential Guard. The war was just the  consequence of the massacres.    What can we do today? First, those who started the massacres  should decide to stop. I launch an appeal from here to the  Rwandan Army and to the government put in place by a hidden  coup. Another solution is that the Rwandan Army and the  RPF--after the war started by the RPF--try to start talks. But  it is still necessary to stop the massacres first.    In other words, in order to solve the problem (?we would  like  to see) on the ground a military victory of any kind by the RPF.  I do not know whether the RPF agrees on this point. [passage  as heard] In any case the RPF controls Kanombe Airport and the  country's most important barracks today. They should understand  that the time has now come for talks so that the other party can  give a positive answer and fulfill the conditions set by the  RPF, that is the end of massacres. They must talk and solve  this Rwandan problem, because it is a problem that concerns us  all.    [Correspondent] Does the Arusha Agreement have any kind of  validity left. Is it still possible to discuss?    [Twagiramungu] I do not think so, and luckily the other  political players do not think so either.    [Correspondent] With whom do you accept to talk with right  now?    [Twagiramungu] You mean myself, or the democratic forces and  parties for change?    [Correspondent] Yourself.    [Twagiramungu] I prefer to talk to all those who are  interested in the situation in my country: The RPF, the  democratic forces for change. I am also interested in finding  moderates within the parties that started the massacres: The  MRND [Republican National Movement for Democracy and  Development] and the CDR [Coalition for the Defense of the  Republic].    [Correspondent] What will you personally do in the next few  weeks?    [Twagiramungu] In the next few weeks I will start to  meet--it  has already been decided--members of the democratic parties for  change. I will also meet members of the RPF's Executive  Committee. I think we must continue to look together for  solutions that may put an end to fighting.    [Correspondent] It seems that the RPF absolutely does not  want to talk to the MRND and the CDR. However, you are in favor  of dialogue.    [Twagiramungu] I do not want to talk to the parties. I want  to talk to those who showed some restraint and who were not  involved in the latest massacres.    [Correspondent] What should be the UN troops' precise role?  The RPF does not want any buffer force.    [Twagiramungu] The RPF does not want a buffer force and I do  not want a buffer force, but yesterday in New York the RPF  decided that these 5,500 people should go to Rwanda to provide  security in areas to be chosen, provide security in the food  supplies corridor, and respond to attack from the militia's.  Otherwise, I cannot see the goal of the mission.    [Correspondent] How is your relationship with the French  authorities now?    [Twagiramungu] We just exchange information. As I am a  witness of what is going on in my country, I have given enough  information and have asked clear questions on the situation. I  have been told that France does not provide weapons anymore to  the Rwandan regular army.    [Correspondent] Thank you.</p>

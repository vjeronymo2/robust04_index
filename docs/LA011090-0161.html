			<p><P> January 10, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> DERSHOWITZ HIRED BY HELMSLEY  </P> <P> Leona Helmsley has hired Alan Dershowitz, the Harvard law professor who helped  clear Claus von Bulow of attempted murder, to handle the appeal of her tax  evasion conviction.  </P> <P> The appeal team also will include Susan Estrich, who headed Michael S. Dukakis'  unsuccessful presidential campaign.  </P> <P> Dershowitz says Helmsley has been "very pleasant" during their Boston meetings  and he says her image as a tempestuous shrew is undeserved. "She is demanding  but I like working for demanding people," he said. "She wants to be sure no  stone is unturned. Were she a man, she'd be regarded as exacting and  demanding."  </P> <P> Helmsley, 69, was sentenced to four years in prison and fined $7.1 million for  cheating on her taxes but Dershowitz says his review of her records probably  will show that the government owes her. "This is a woman who paid over $300  million a year in taxes and she has probably overpaid her taxes," he said.  </P></p>

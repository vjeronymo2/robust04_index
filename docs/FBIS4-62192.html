			<p>BFN     [Text] The Foreign Minister of the self-proclaimed  Nagorno-Karabakh Republic Arkady Gukasian does not rule out the  possibility that reports about Azerbaijan signing the Bishkek  protocol of a settlement in Karabakh on 8 May is another  tactical move on the part of Baku. He said Stepanakert has not  yet received the protocol signed by the speaker of the Azeri  parliament Rasul Guliyev.    In a Wednesday [11 May] interview with INTERFAX Gukasian  said  that in reality the Azeri side is psychologically not ready for  the peaceful settlement of the conflict. He named as evidence  the situation on the front-line where Azeri troops continue  attacking Karabakh positions.    Gukasian stressed that a political settlement is impossible  without guarantees of a complete cease-fire. He also declared  that Nagorno-Karabakh should be recognized as a conflicting  side. In his opinion only the deployment of a peace-keeping  force in the conflict zone can stop the bloodshed.</p>

			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / Markets Report: Focus on CBI survey The Swedish krona and the Danish krone were yesterday the most active currencies in an otherwise quiet day on the foreign exchanges, writes Philip Gawith. Markets have struggled to develop direction or momentum in the absence of any important data releases. In the UK, at least, this should change today with the release of the CBI's monthly trends survey. The price expectations figure will be closely watched, for a hint of the likely outlook for UK interest rates. In Scandinavia, markets are increasingly influenced by political factors, with Sweden facing a general election on September 18, and the date for a Danish election undecided. The Swedish krona finished at SKr4.933 against the D-Mark, from a close on Wednesday of SKr4.952. Earlier it had fallen to a low of SKr4.9730 on rumours of a downgrading of Swedish debt. The Danish krone closed at DKr3.965, from DKr3.967, after earlier weakening to SKr3.9790. The dollar was firmer against the yen, helped by support from the Bank of Japan. It finished at Y99.735 from Y98.415. Against the D-Mark it rose half a pfennig to DM1.5462 from DM1.5411. Sterling had a quiet day, finishing slightly down against the firmer dollar, at Dollars 1.5526 from Dollars 1.5558. Against the D-Mark it closed at DM2.4005 from DM2.3977. The gyrations in the Danish krone appeared to owe more to concerns about the timing of the forthcoming election, than to Wednesday's details of the draft 1995 budget. A rumour doing the rounds suggested that the government might be planning a snap election in September, rather than waiting until November, as had generally been assumed. Mr Jouni Kokko, international economist at SG Warburg in London, said the budget itself 'had been very much a non-event.' Much of the detail had been leaked in advance, the key feature being a moderate tightening of fiscal policy. Mr Erik Hoffmeyer, the central bank president, yesterday welcomed it, saying it was a continuation of the government's 'cautious approach'. Mr Kokko said the market did not have too much to be concerned about, with the choice between what is already a good government, and one that might be more credible. 'If there is a policy consensus anywhere in Europe, it must be in Denmark,' he said. The catalyst for weakness in Sweden was a repeat of the recent concern that Swedish debt might be downgraded. Mr Jeremy Hawkins, chief economist at the Bank of American in London, said the Scandinavian currencies were trading fairly firmly. 'However, at these sorts of levels they still offer an opportunity to go out and buy D-Marks, given that there is so much uncertainty ahead.' Analysts said the firmer tone to the dollar indicated optimism that a breakthrough would be achieved in US-Japan trade talks by the end of September deadline. Dollar bulls also took comfort from the comments of Mr Fred Bergsten, the influential US economist, who said the yen had 'fundamentally peaked' around current levels. Japanese officials, however, were more cautious, with a senior official at the Ministry of Trade and Industry in Tokyo saying that he was 'not optimistic' about an early trade deal with the US. Mr Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics in New York takes a similar line. Noting that the US trade gap had widened, relative to a year previously, in all but one of the last 28 months, he commented: 'As long as the US trade balance remains unbalanced, it will take substantial capital flows - generated by substantial interest rate differentials and strong bond returns - to finance that gap. Thus the dollar needs bigger marginal changes than the Fed induced last week to hold it up.' The short sterling market had another quiet day, but the release of the CBI survey will give it more to chew on. In his meeting with the chancellor on July 6, Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, noted that 'the CBI price expectations balance had in the past been a good leading indicator of producer prices.' Another high balance - following on plus 12 in June and July - would increase expectations of a near term rise in base rates. Mr Hawkins of Bank of America said the expectation of higher rates tended to help sterling. Should the market decide, however, that the Bank is 'behind the game' in fighting inflation, it may sell the currency. The Bank of England provided late assistance of Pounds 270m to UK money markets. It did not operate in the morning and afternoon rounds, after forecasting a Pounds 300m shortage. Overnight money traded between 4 and 5 3/4 per cent. In Germany, traders said call money was being bid down aggressively, with most trade occurring at 4.8 per cent, below the 4.85 per cent repo rate. The market was unsure whether West German inflation data - prices rose by 3 per cent, year-on-year to August - helped or hindered the case for lower rates.</p>

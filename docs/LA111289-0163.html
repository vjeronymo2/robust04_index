			<p><P> November 12, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> OCCIDENTAL TAKES CONFERENCE TITLE WITH 7-0 VICTORY  </P> <P> Funny how Whittier College -- a team that is third in the Southern California  Intercollegiate Athletic Conference -- seems to bring out the worst in  Occidental.  </P> <P> Just two weeks after the Tigers' dismal performance in a loss at Whittier,  Occidental accounted for only 172 yards and seven points. The Tigers didn't  even score a touchdown, posting their points on two safeties and a field goal.  </P> <P> Yet that proved sufficient as Occidental defeated Whittier, 7-0, Saturday night  in a conference finale at Occidental.  </P> <P> With the victory, the Tigers clinched the SCIAC championship outright.  Occidental (6 1/2-1 1/2 overall, 4-0-1 in conference play) has won or shared  the title for three consecutive years and six of the past seven.  </P> <P> A bright point was the play of the Tigers' defensive front, which sacked  quarterback Mike Haney eight times.  </P> <P> The Tigers trapped Whittier (2 1/2-5 1/2, 2 1/2-2 1/2) deep in its own  territory midway through the fourth quarter. Punter Stuart Lewin was in the  Poets' end zone to receive the snap but the ball sailed over his head. Lewin  attempted to get the kick off but stepped out of the end zone for a safety --  Whittier's second -- giving Occidental a 7-0 lead.  </P> <P> Jeremy Dickinson returned the ensuing kick 75 yards for an apparent Occidental  score, but the run was nullified by a clipping penalty.  </P> <P> In all, Occidental was penalized 14 times for 105 yards. Whittier was flagged  seven times for 100.  </P> <P> The Tigers took a 2-0 edge with 3:56 to play in the first quarter after Jeremy  Dickinson blocked Stuart Lewin's punt out of the end zone for a safety.  </P> <P> Mark Collinsworth made a 30-yard field goal midway through the second quarter  to give the Tigers a 5-0 advantage. The 10-play scoring drive began at the  Whittier 45 and was kept alive by an unsportsmanlike conduct call.  </P> <P> Whittier, which has gained the fewest yards in conference play (280.1 yards a  game), showed why in the first half, netting just nine yards.  </P> <P> Occidental did not fare much better. The Tigers' top back, Gary Little, gained  37 yards in 15 carries. Little's first run -- of 37 yards -- was called back  due to an illegal-procedure penalty.  </P> <P> Little fumbled his second carry and the ball was recovered by Whittier's Chad  Ledbetter at the Occidental 22.  </P> <P> Six plays later, Michael Westmoreland attempted a 22-yard field goal but the  kick was blocked by Brady Dargan. It was the last time the Poets threatened in  the half.  </P> <P> Tony Werbelow provided some offense between the 20-yard lines for the Tigers,  completing seven of eight passes for 67 yards.  </P> <P> Mike Haney, who was sacked five times in the first half, completed two of nine  passes for 19 yards.  </P></p>

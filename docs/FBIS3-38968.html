Shortly before the meeting of  the NATO Council in Brussels today, senior officials hoped for  the full implementation of UN Resolution 836, which asked NATO  to establish protection zones. According to the officials, this  also includes protection of convoys transporting humanitarian  aid, which has not been guaranteed so far.    Officials believe this would also mean clearing the path for  the convoys by forcibly removing blockades. Combat helicopters  might be used for this purpose ("close air support"). Unlike  air strikes, these measures would be covered by the existing  mandate and would not require a new Security Council resolution,  which would be difficult to achieve at the moment in view of the  negative attitude of Russia and other permanent members.    According to the Chancellor's Office, the full utilization  of  the existing mandate would improve the credibility of the West,  and a higher deterrence effect would be achieved. Public  demands for large-scale air strikes, recently voiced on  television by Bernd Schmidbauer, the minister in the  Chancellor's Office, who is responsible for the intelligence  services, have met with great reservations. Schmidbauer's view  is not shared by others at the Chancellor's Office, it has  become known.</p>

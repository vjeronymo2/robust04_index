			<p><P> March 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE VEGETARIAN: RED PEPPERS, CHEESE: PRETTY APPETIZER  </P> <P> There seems to be a run on sweet red peppers at present, with huge, glossy  specimens going for half the usual price. Aside from adding a subtle sweetness  to tossed salads or vegetable sautes, red peppers are a good source of Vitamin  C.  </P> <P> Here's a recipe that combines the sweet peppers with a tangy cheese for an  unconventional appetizer or side dish.  </P> <P> RED PEPPER TERRINES  </P> <P> 4 medium sweet red peppers, halved, cored and seeded  </P> <P> 4 eggs, lightly beaten  </P> <P> 1/4 cup fine dry bread crumbs  </P> <P> 1 cup cottage cheese  </P> <P> 1/2 cup feta cheese  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano, crumbled  </P> <P> Dash salt  </P> <P> Butter  </P> <P> 6 small bay leaves  </P> <P> Place peppers on broiling pan and broil until charred, about 10 minutes,  turning as needed. Transfer to plastic bag and place in freezer 15 minutes.  </P> <P> Peel peppers, slice and puree in blender or food processor. Add eggs, bread  crumbs, cottage cheese and feta cheese. Blend until well combined. Add oregano  and salt. Blend again.  </P> <P> Lightly butter 6 (6-ounce) ramekins or custard cups. Place 1 bay leaf in bottom  of each ramekin. Divide pepper mixture evenly among cups. Place in deep  roasting or baking pan. Pour hot water to halfway up ramekins. Bake at 375  degrees 50 minutes or until knife inserted in center comes out clean.  </P> <P> Let cool on rack 15 minutes. Run knife around edge of each terrine and invert  onto serving dish. Makes 6 first course servings.  </P></p>

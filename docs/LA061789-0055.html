			<p><P> June 17, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'NAPOLEON' SCREENINGS  </P> <P> I was somewhat disappointed in your May 30 Morning Report item on Frances  Coppola and the film "Napoleon." (A feature of this film is my musical score,  which I conduct.) "Napoleon" is not being brought "out of exile," as your  article says, but has been going strong in major cities as recently as six  months ago -- in Hanover, Valencia, Madrid, etc.  </P> <P> CARMINE COPPOLA  </P> <P> Woodland Hills  </P></p>

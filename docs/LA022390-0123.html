			<p><P> February 23, 1990, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> MEMORIES SOMETIMES BLUR IN 10 YEARS SINCE 'THE MIRACLE ON ICE'  </P> <P> It's 10 years this week that the U.S. Olympic Hockey Team stuck its foot into  the glass slipper and walked away with a gold medal at Lake Placid, a fairy  tale if there ever was one, and, boy, where does the time go? Herb Brooks  looked so young and mean back then, and like his players it's hard to imagine  him ever growing old. And now Herb Brooks is 52.  </P> <P> The legend of Lake Placid has aged, too, a few of the details growing fuzzy,  the mind playing a few tricks. But the story endures because the kids from the  U S of A did more than just capture a championship. They began the Olympics as  longshots; they left as heroes.  </P> <P> They wrote a happy ending.  </P> <P> These weren't high-priced superstars tooling around in Ferraris and hanging out  at Elaine's. They were collegians and failed minor-leaguers giving it their  best shot and, what the heck, seeing what could happen. The Soviets were big  and powerful -- invincible, we all thought. Team USA was made up of youngsters  from down the block who mowed your lawn.  </P> <P> "I remember a meeting we had early on, after the team was picked," said Rob  McClanahan, then a center and now a sales broker in Chicago. "Herb gave us a  talk and although he didn't say this exactly, the message was something like,  'If we play very well, get some breaks, we could win a bronze medal. If we play  over our heads, catch a huge break, we can get a silver. The gold is the  Russians'. Forget about it."'  </P> <P> But it's been a long time, so every once in a while the memories become  blurred. A guy will say, "Remember the night the USA beat the Soviets and won  the gold medal?" And, of course, it didn't happen that way at all. The United  States beat the Soviets all right, but it was two days later -- Feb. 24, 1980  -- that the Americans clinched the gold medal by defeating Finland. Odd, but  that game is like a footnote now.  </P> <P> "Know what?" said Mark Johnson, who plays for the New Jersey Devils these days.  "Everyone thinks we won the gold medal in the game against the Russians, except  the people who were there." It's, like, as long as they beat the Soviets,  nothing else matters.  </P> <P> But it does. Those upstarts from small towns like Grand Rapids, Minn., and  Charleston, Mass., tossing their sticks in the air, Mike Eruzione collapsed in  tears, Jim Craig wrapped in an American flag and asking, "Where's my father?"  -- that was like something out of a TV movie that, naturally, it became. If you  happened to miss it, it was called "Miracle on Ice."  </P> <P> "The movie?" McClanahan said. "To me, it was a little sappy."  </P> <P> Like anything else, the movie exaggerated a few facts, ignored some others, and  squashed eight months of practice, travel and competition into three hours in  prime time. It came across like a real tearjerker, all hearts and flowers. The  fact is, the Olympians rode a bumpy path to Lake Placid. People forget that.  </P> <P> By the time the Americans arrived, they were exhausted and cranky from a  nationwide tour. There was some squabbling. And the country really didn't take  much notice of the team until the game against the Soviets, a story in itself.  </P> <P> The Soviets had demolished the United States, 10-3, in a pre-Olympic game at  Madison Square Garden. So Brooks figured he'd better have something good to say  to inspire his young players.  </P> <P> The locker room was hushed when he stood up before the game, reached into his  pocket and fished out a wrinkled slip of paper. And then he said:  </P> <P> "You are born to be a player. You are meant to be here at this time. This is  your moment."  </P> <P> As speeches go, it was right up there with Knute Rockne telling Notre Dame to  win one for the Gipper. But, it turns out, Brooks really hadn't been sure of  what he wanted to say. He scribbled down a few notes and phrases and then kind  of blurted them out, not exactly the way the story's been passed down.  </P> <P> Brooks laughs about it now. "It just sort of came out the way it did," he said.  "Let me tell you something, it was no Gettysburg Address."  </P> <P> Let's just say it did the job. Johnson's shot with one second left in the first  period pulled the United States into a 2-2 tie and the Soviets, panicking,  yanked their famous goalie, Vladislav Tretiak. Behind 3-2 in the third period,  the Americans fought back with goals by Dave Silk and Eruzione, won the game,  4-3, and the fable began to unfold.  </P> <P> The natural reaction was to think that the dispirited Soviets had nothing but  contempt for the Americans. It also was natural to think the Americans loved  sticking it to the Soviets, them being Communists and all. But as Eruzione  said, "We were athletes, and to us it was an athletic event. We didn't think of  it as a political event."  </P> <P> If anything, they were too busy slapping helmets and trying to grasp the  enormity of their victory. And the Soviets, well, they understood and  appreciated just what the U.S. players had achieved, although it wasn't until  later that congratulations were passed along in a whisper and a smile.  </P> <P> Minutes after leaving the ice, Johnson was in an office supplying a urine  sample to the drug-testing people when he caught the eye of Boris Mikhailov,  the Soviet captain, sitting on a bench across the room. Mikhailov motioned  Johnson closer.  </P> <P> "You guys play very well," he said, his thick accent right out of a spy flick.  </P> <P> "It surprised me," Johnson said. "I didn't expect it. To be honest, he sounded  happy for us."  </P> <P> That victory got the puck rolling. The Americans, cast in the role of upstarts,  had a wholesome appeal, even if some of it was contrived. True, they were  bouncy, happy, working-class kids, but their closeness has always been a little  overstated. Remember, some teammates got bugged when Brooks bent the rules and  let defenseman Ken Morrow keep his beard.  </P> <P> "We were close," Morrow said. "But we also had a lot of different groups --  cliques -- guys from Boston, guys from Michigan, a big Minnesota contingent.  There was always a lot of kidding going on, a lot of rivalry. What I'm trying  to say is, we were just like any normal team."  </P> <P> Morrow would go on to win four Stanley Cups with the New York Islanders after  winning the gold medal, which must be some kind of record, and now is an  assistant coach with the New York Rangers' farm team in Flint, Mich. Craig  rebounded from a brief, checkered NHL career, eventually was cleared of  criminal charges stemming from a fatal automobile accident and currently is a  sales representative in Brockton, Mass. Mark Pavelich, who always skated to his  own beat, hunts and fishes in the Minnesota woods.  </P> <P> But it's funny how things work out sometimes. Johnson and Viacheslav Fetisov,  the great Soviet defenseman, are teammates now with the Devils.  </P> <P> Thirteen of the Olympians, plus Brooks and assistant coach Craig Patrick, rode  the wave of popularity to careers in the NHL. For most of them, though, there's  been nothing like the afternoon they beat the Finns, 4-2, for the gold medal  while the crowd in Lake Placid chanted, "U!S!A!"  </P> <P> "That's why we write history books," Brooks said. "It gives us perspective. And  the perspective we have now is that we proved that certain ingredients and the  proper intangibles shared by a group can make things happen for the betterment  of that group; that a work ethic, comradeship, and love and respect for  teammates can make a difference.  </P> <P> "And we learned good things happen if the group has its head screwed on right."  </P> <P> Of course, the line that everyone remembers is Al Michaels shouting: "Do you  believe in miracles?" Now, the word "miracle" gets a lot of exposure, what with  every game-winning, ground-rule double immediately videotaped and immortalized.  The Americans, all freckles and goose bumps, coming out of nowhere to beat the  odds and win the gold, that may not exactly qualify as a miracle.  </P> <P> But it's close.  </P></p>

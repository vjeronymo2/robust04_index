			<p><P> April 20, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MAKING AMENDS  </P> <P> The furor in the Vietnamese community that followed the unfortunate and  misguided remark last week by Westminster Councilman Frank Fry Jr. has  subsided. An air of normalcy seems to have been restored. And community leaders  have been able to use the mistake to face directly those pockets of prejudice  that persist.  </P> <P> When Fry, in voting to deny a parade permit being sought by a group of  Vietnamese veterans, told them, "If you want to be South Vietnamese, go back to  South Vietnam," he stirred many emotions. The ripple effect of his insensitive  remark even reached back to Vietnam.  </P> <P> In Orange County generally, and in Westminster in particular, the reaction was  strong. Vietnamese refugees were outraged. In a matter of days they had printed  up more than 5,000 flyers and 500 posters critical of Fry and were ready to  launch a campaign to recall him from the City Council.  </P> <P> Fortunately, the Orange County Human Relations Commission moved in. Quickly and  decisively -- led by Rusty Kennedy, its executive director, and Dr. Daniel H.  Ninburg, its chairman -- the commission met with Fry and Vietnamese leaders and  deterred further divisiveness and bitter reactions. Fry apologized, and the  Vietnamese leaders, who wanted that public apology, accepted it, called off  their recall effort and expressed their hope for greater harmony in the  community.  </P> <P> The veterans group that was planning the parade as part of a June Vietnamese  holiday, which is similar to the American Memorial Day holiday, will meet  Friday to discuss what to do next about the march that is intended to honor all  the soldiers, foreign and Vietnamese, who fought the communists in Vietnam.  </P> <P> The feeling in the county is not the same as it was before Fry's remark. It is  a troubling reality -- but nevertheless a reality -- that some harbor prejudice  against Southeast Asian refugees. The prejudice usually lies dormant until an  intolerant remark or public action brings it to the surface and then the old  myths and misconceptions are heard again, including indignation about special  low-interest loan programs that never existed and complaints about special  treatment given Southeast Asian refugees.  </P> <P> This time was no different, but the hostility seemed to be less virulent and  widespread than on some occasions in the past. And the new residents, many of  them American citizens, reacted responsibly in the face of the inexcusable  provocation.  </P> <P> As one Vietnamese leader said, praising Fry for his public apology, the  Vietnamese community regretted Fry's remarks but "it's forgivable" and "it's  forgettable." The entire community could benefit from that same attitude, and  also make Fry's remark and the passions of divisive prejudice forgettable as  well.  </P></p>

			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / Letter: Share not worthless Sir, Charles Batchelor's article ('How to put a value on a share of the action', April 28) suggests that a shareholding of 25 per cent or less in a private company is 'practically worthless, particularly if no dividends are paid and majority shareholder(s) are ready to faze the minority out'. I wonder whether the many small minority shareholders who have benefited from their companies exploring the opportunities of an exit route would agree with this generalisation. Valuation is indeed more of an art than a science. It should always reflect the possibility of shareholders being able to reap the benefit of unlocking several years' undistributed profits from an apparent illiquid and risky investment. Subjective, yes, but 'practically worthless', no. John Allday, Ernst &amp; Young, 1 Lambeth Palace Road, London SE1 7EU</p>

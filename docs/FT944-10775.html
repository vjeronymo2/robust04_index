			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Observer: Dog tired Exeter police have fingered a pig. It has to take part in an identity parade, they say, and sniff out its rightful owner - ownership is being contested by four people. Of course, this problem could be avoided if yet another Japanese idea were to be rapidly imported. Japan's health ministry is now thinking of implanting identification microchips into dogs. A hand-held radio decoder - similar to technology used by shop-workers - would give instant details of the dog's owner. This could be highly embarrassing: 'Excuse me, sir, but we have a dog here claiming to be Fifi-tinkerbelle and that you are its owner. . .'</p>

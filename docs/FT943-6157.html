			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Allied forces Europe's defence industry has been set a challenge by the planned Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.4bn) merger between Lockheed and Martin Marietta. Lockheed Martin will not simply be a giant. The merger also marks an intensification of the trend to create a lean US defence industry better able to win orders in international markets. In the past, it may have been possible to argue that US armaments were over-engineered and uncompetitive, so dependent had companies become on soft Pentagon contracts. But the industry has reacted determinedly to the end of the cold war by shedding staff and merging facilities. Lockheed and Martin Marietta were important agents of change even before yesterday's deal. Much of the activity so far has involved horizontal integration. This was the case in Northrop's Dollars 2bn takeover of Grumman in April. The Lockheed Martin merger, by contrast, is partly about vertical integration. An aircraft manufacturer is being linked with the world's largest producer of aerospace electronics. The point will not be lost on Britain's GEC-Marconi, which has long considered a vertical merger with British Aerospace. Lockheed Martin must still receive US antitrust approval. But this hurdle is relatively low by comparison with the problems European defence groups face in knocking their industry into shape. Continued concerns over national sovereignty have virtually ruled out large cross-border takeovers and, instead, encouraged messy collaborations like Eurofighter. But stepped-up restructuring in the US means that the European approach to rationalisation looks increasingly like an unsatisfactory half-way house.</p>

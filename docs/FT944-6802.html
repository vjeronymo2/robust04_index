			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Singer to pay Pounds 45m for control of Carnegie Singer &amp; Friedlander, the merchant banking group, is to buy a controlling stake in Carnegie, the international broking house, from Nordbanken of Sweden. The group, which owns the UK broking house Collins Stewart, is expected to announce the details - possibly as early as tomorrow - in conjunction with a convertible share issue to raise the necessary cash. It is thought to be paying around Pounds 45m for a 55 per cent stake in the company. It will take the equity business while Nordbanken will retain the Swedish bond and money broking arm. The purchase and fund-raising are likely to be carried out by Barclays de Zoete Wedd, Singer's broker. The company was not prepared to comment yesterday but a market source said: 'The financing is still being decided but the deal is imminent.' Singer has a diversified growth approach, acquiring sizeable stakes in Associated Nursing Services, Edgar Hamilton - the Lloyd's of London broker - and People's Phone, an independent provider of mobile phone services. It also has a large property portfolio which contributed almost 20 per cent to interim profits in September. It has a significant cash pile and is one of the best capitalised merchant banks in the UK according to banking analysts. While it could afford to raise the extra money for the purchase without tapping shareholders, it is believed to be keeping cash for other ventures. For example increasing its 22 per cent stake in People's Phone. Nordbanken, said yesterday: 'We have been seeking a buyer for over a year. We are concentrating on offering standardised products to private individuals and small and medium-sized companies while Carnegie specialises in medium and large companies and wealthy individuals.' Nordbanken, the worst casualty of Sweden's 1992 banking crisis, was bailed out by the government two years ago and is now set for privatisation after reporting healthy interim profits in August. Earlier this year, it had been in talks about selling Carnegie to Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale.</p>

			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Anger over 'the all-round con' The Warwick and Brindley estate is sandwiched between the Westway motorway and the Harrow Road in a poor backwater of Westminster. Some of its residents provide graphic accounts to illustrate the council's determination to sell off its housing during the 1980s. Tenants in the six tower blocks who yielded to council pressure to buy their properties bitterly regret their decisions. They say any savings from ownership are cancelled out by service and other charges which they pay and tenants do not. More importantly, because only a few properties were sold-off, there is no market and they cannot sell their flats. Only 85 of the 600 flats were sold before the designated sales policy came to an end in that estate in 1988. Since then the council has been moving in homeless families from bed-and-breakfast accommodation and others who cannot afford to pay rent. Mrs Winifred Donald, a retired London Transport worker, says: 'In the mid-1980s whenever a property became vacant, they put a steel door on to prevent squatters. The council told us the properties would be sold. 'We have lived here since the beginning 30 years ago. We bought in 1987 because it was so cheap. We paid Pounds 17,000 which was about 30 per cent of its value, although there was an indemnity which we paid off over five years. 'But now they have moved all these income-support people in. I've nothing against them, mind, but we will never sell the place now. I voted Conservative last time - I am certainly not going to vote Conservative next time.' Mrs Donald wanted to sell the property for Pounds 50,000 and move near to her son in Reading. She says: 'We have had no interest, and they've loaded charges on to us. We have been conned.' Mr Robert Fox, 72 , a retired brewery worker has also been soured by the experience. 'They (the council) kept punching away at us to buy. They said it would be cheaper than renting and that they wanted to sell the whole block,' he says. 'We bought because I've got two boys and I thought it would give them a bit of security. I bought it for Pounds 15,000 with a Pounds 10,000 indemnity. Even with the indemnity this was only 40 per cent of its face value. I bought it out of savings. 'But now they are putting all these charges on us. We have to pay Pounds 4.50 for gates and a concierge they want to put in. They want thousands from us for repairs to the outside of the building. They are not asking the tenants, most of them can't pay anyway. 'I could not sell the place even if I wanted to although it is supposed to be worth Pounds 60,000. If anything happened to me or my wife my sons could not pay the charges and the place would be repossessed. It's been one all-round con.'</p>

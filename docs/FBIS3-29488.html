[passage  omitted on a Dietman's question]    [Begin Hosokawa recording] In the areas of improving  transparancy in procedures on insurance and government  procurement, cooperation of Japanese and U.S. industries in  automobiles, deregulation -- of which you too just said  easygoing action will not be accepted -- or promoting imports  and investments in Japan, I think we must be positive in all our  actions. [end recording]    Masahiro Koga of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] then asked  him about U.S. President Bill Clinton's criticism of Japan's  economy-related government offices in reference to the failure  of the Japan-U.S. economic consultations. The President cited  the names of the government offices in making the criticism. In  reply to the question, Prime Minister Hosokawa said the recent  negotiations were not led by government officials, and the  officials had to endure a lot during the negotiations. Setting  numerical targets would lead to managed trade, and, hence, goes  against the national interests of Japan. It is only natural  that the people oppose it, whether they be politicians or  bureaucrats. The prime minister thus said such criticism is not  appropriate.

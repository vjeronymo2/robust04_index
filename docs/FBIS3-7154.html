It is thanks to the mighty independent national economy that  the DPRK has developed the economy unaffected by the worldwide  economic fluctuation under the situation in which the socialist  market collapsed and anti-DPRK campaign by the imperialists and  reactionaries has been intensified as never before.    Today Korea has many-sided and modern industry enough to  produce by itself heavy and light industrial products needed for  economic construction, defence upbuilding and people's living.    In the electric power industrial domain the Pukchang thermal  power complex, the Taechon power stations and many other large  hydro and thermal power plants and minor power stations have  been built. As a result, the electric power output was 55,500  million kwh in 1989 and that in late 1993 was 30 percent up on  the 1986 figure.    In mining industry, large-scale coal mines in Anju, Sunchon  and Pukchang and the Komdok general mining enterprise and other  mines in Tanchon and Yanggang Province have been reconstructed  on an expansion basis and a large number of new coal mines, ore  mines and pits have been developed in those districts rich in  deposit and favourable for mining.    The coal output has grown year by year and in 1993 it was 40  percent up on the 1986 figure.    The output of nonferrous metal ores increased 60 percent in  the period of the fulfilment of the third seven-year plan.    The production capacity of the Kim Chaek Iron and steel  complex, the Chollima steel complex and other iron and steel  works has expanded and new bases for producing various kinds of  steel such as pressure pipes and stainless steel pipes have been  built to considerably raise the steel output in the metal  industry.    With the rapid development of machine building, electronic,  and automation industries, a great advance has been made in  introducing precision, large-size and high-speed equipment and  the material and technical foundations of the electronic and  automation industries have been further consolidated.    These sectors produced a 10,000-ton press, 125,000 kv-a  [kilovolt-ampere] hydraulic generators, an extra-large-sized  oxygen plant and NC [numerically controlled] machine tools and  are now manufacturing complete sets of metal, chemical,  building, electric and other equipment needed for different  sectors of the national economy.    With the development of chemical industry, light industry,  fisheries and agriculture the need for the people's living is  being met with domestic products.    The Korean people have the mighty socialist independent  national economy and abundant resources enough to live on their  own efforts under any situation.    No political and ideological offensive, economic blockade  and  military threat of the imperialists and reactionaries can  frighten the Korean people.</p>

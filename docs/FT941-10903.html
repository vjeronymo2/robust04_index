			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / Survey of Emerging Markets (24): Magic carpet not ready for take-off - Middle East Equity markets in the Arab world are not yet in a position to offer a soaring magic carpet to international investors. The swathe of states from Morocco to Syria have no roaring economic 'tigers' and there is as yet no golden prospect of a capitalist rebirth - though progress towards Middle East peace has quickened the pulse of many investors. Most countries remain in the very earliest stages of liberalising reforms which might eventually present profitable opportunities. But the region is far from being an equity desert. Most states have stock markets of varying maturities and development - the exceptions being Libya, Syria, Yemen and, for the time being, Lebanon. And although most markets are either closed to foreign investors, or difficult to penetrate, international interest is rising. A survey by Kleiman International Consultants last November found that half of the 40 institutions it surveyed had holdings in Middle Eastern or North African markets in 1993, against just 7 per cent in 1990. The trick, according to the growing number of institutions showing an interest in the region's generally pre-emerging markets, is careful picking and choosing. And while none of the region's markets makes it, for instance, into The Economist's new premiership league table of 24 markets to watch, investors have already begun to pick some regional leaders and laggards. Two markets, in particular, are already being singled out for particular attention. Chief among these is Jordan's market. The Amman financial market, with more than 110 listed companies and capitalisation of JD3.5bn is among the region's most profitable and ably-run. Buoyed by two successive years of strong real economic growth, sustained government commitment to International Monetary Fund reforms, high liquidity and, most recently, by optimism over the peace process, the market's index rose by 30 per cent in 1992 and was a further 23 per cent up by the end of last year. Although the government and its agencies hold substantial stakes in many Jordanian companies - notably in tourism and minerals companies - it is nevertheless among the most highly traded markets in the region. Mr Miles Morland, of Blakeney Consultants, one of the few Middle East market specialists, says at least half of total issued stock is tradeable - far higher than the regional average. As important, in Mr Morland's view, is the degree of local participation in the market, in which he estimates there are around 100,000 participants. Few if any Middle Eastern bourses can compare on that count. Such buoyancy has attracted considerable outside interest, even though direct non-Arab participation in the market requires government approval - a procedure which can take months. Official figures suggest, however, that at least 15 per cent of the market is in non-Jordanian, mostly Gulf Arab, hands. Only 2-3 per cent is reckoned to be held by non-Arabs. But this should change given the degree of interest being shown by western institutions. Ten leading institutions, including Lehman Brothers, Goldman Sachs, Baring Securities and Citicorp recently won approval from the prime minister's office to operate in the market and, according to Mr Dan Smaller of Lehmans, the market can expect 'substantial' inward investment during 1994. 'The peace process has taken away a big risk. Even if the details of peace take time to negotiate, the breakthrough has removed a big obstacle,' he says, adding that he expects Lehman to commit up to Dollars 25m to the market during the first quarter of this year. The second regional star performer is Morocco, where investors are impressed less by the maturity of the local stock market than by the government's clear and so far successful commitment to privatisation. The Casablanca bourse remains lethargic, suffering the common regional ailments of a shortage of scrip - only 69 companies are listed - and low liquidity. But this has not impeded a large influx of foreign capital into a privatisation programme which the government has been seeing through with untypical energy for the region. As Mr Morland remarks: 'Privatisation is the key - because that's what forces governments to look at their stock markets.' Last year the Moroccan government exceeded by 40 per cent its target of state asset sales, with total receipts hitting Dollars 250m. By the end of 1995 the government aims to have sold a further 112 companies or assets worth almost Dollars 2bn, and foreign buyers are being embraced. At the end of last year, for example, a French subsidiary of Holderbank bought a 51 per cent stake in CIOR, the state cement group in an offering which was five times oversubscribed. The sale last summer of CTM, a state transport group, also injected 40 per cent of its capital into the equity market, and analysts are confident that privatisation will substantially add to the supply of new scrip throughout 1994. Elsewhere in the region, however, prospects appear more mixed. In North Africa, Tunisia is seen as offering some opportunities, again because of the government's commitment to IMF-guided liberalisation policies and its equal desire to attract foreign capital. However, Tunisia's privatisation programme continues to move more cautiously than in Morocco, where some analysts also consider that the absence of any history of socialist administration is also giving Casablanca an enterprising edge. Egypt is perhaps the greatest disappointment in the region. Although the government has made remarkable progress with broad macro-economic reforms under two years of IMF tutelage, its own privatisation programme has become heavily bogged down by a combination of bureaucratic inertia and profound government caution over the potential political effects of selling off large parts of the sprawling public sector. The result has been to deprive Egypt's market of the new issues it requires to establish a properly liquid bourse - one which before the 1950s was the world's fifth busiest. Although more than 450 companies are technically listed on the exchange, no more than 35 or so are ever traded and Kidder Peabody includes only 24 of these on its market index as truly liquid stocks. These, according to Mr Aladdin Saba, vice-president of Kidder Peabody Egypt, represent a capitalisation of around EPounds 1bn (USDollars 297m). Direct foreign participation is possible - though some companies retain a statutory ban on foreign ownership - and, according to Mr Saba, some foreign money has been entering the market over the past 18 months, mainly from the Gulf. The result has been to lift the Kidder index by more than 60 per cent over the past year. But, as Mr Saba concedes, this was from a low base. There is also some disappointment in the market over the new capital market regulations introduced last year, which abolished an historical imbalance in the taxation of dividends and bank deposits. Many consider the new rules, which also govern the creation of market intermediaries, remain too restrictive. 'The government looked at these rules as a regulatory instrument, rather than as a business opportunity,' says one market player, who believes Egypt is in danger of losing out to Jordan and other regional bourses. For the time being, this excludes markets in the Gulf states, which remain closed to foreign investment. But this, too, may soon change. The biggest and healthiest Gulf market, in Saudi Arabia, boasts a capitalisation of around Dollars 50bn and vigorous trading. So far, however, the Saudi authorities have resisted any temptation to open their floorless and increasingly sophisticated market to foreign investors. Other Gulf states, however, may prove less cautious. Oman and Bahrain, in particular, are already examining ways to open their small bourses. For Mr Morland and several other analysts, these markets may well be among the most interesting of 1994. Falling oil prices, diminishing state revenues and the attendant appeal of attracting foreign capital into non-oil industrial ventures might all spur a greater opening, Mr Morland suggests. 'My guess is this is the year when these markets will begin to emerge,' he says. Just this month, the government of the United Arab Emirates set up a cabinet committee to examine formalising and centralising its kerb share market. The committee is expected to consider from the outset the option of opening the market to international investors. Another newcomer over the next year could be Syria, where a draft bill for the country's first stock exchange has been awaiting submission to the People's Assembly since last Spring. Informal share trading thrives in the Damascus souk and many businessmen in the country believe an official market is an inevitable concomitant to Syria's cautious economic liberalisation - though little financial infrastructure exists at present in what remains a highly centralised state-based economy. But perhaps the most exciting prospect in the region lies in Lebanon, where the stock market has been closed since it was abandoned at the height of the civil war in 1983. The successful offering to Lebanese and Arab investors in Solidere, the company established to rebuild downtown Beirut, has created the basis upon which the Lebanese government will restart what many in the region consider likely to be the Middle East's most promising market. Andersen Consultants in London are already working on creating the framework for a secondary market in the Dollars 1.8bn company's shares and the central bank says it hopes to see trading in up to eight companies' shares within eight months. Few doubt the appeal of a resumed Lebanese stock market, which is likely to be open to outside capital. Those with the greatest faith in the inherent trading ability of the Lebanese predict the new market will be among the highest flyers in 1994/95.</p>

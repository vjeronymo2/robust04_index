			<p><P> July 28, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEBATE OVER RAIL LINES  </P> <P> Offerings for sale of Southern Pacific and Santa Fe rail line rights of way is  a timely opportunity that should not be missed by the Los Angeles  Transportation Commission.  </P> <P> These rights of way can provide a nucleus for development of a modern rail mass  transit system throughout the county that is critical to our area's future,  moving large numbers of people efficiently, helping reduce air pollution and  preventing gridlock.  </P> <P> The former Pacific Electric Red Car rail system utilized some of these same  rights of way, and was excellent, fast and efficient and provided the needs for  many commuters.  </P> <P> The dismantling of the rail service was initiated and completed by the  shortsighted greed of special interests, which was later confirmed by  congressional inquiry.  </P> <P> For those concerned with the noise factor, may I point out, modern rail  technology offers a quieter mode of transportation than automobiles, buses,  trucks and motorcycles.  </P> <P> JACK KRIEGER  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The End of the Military Press"] </F>   [Text] The publication of more than 10 military  periodicals -- from such specific ones as the journals AVIATSIYA  I KOSMONAVTIKA and TEKHNIKA I VOORUZHENIYE, to popular weeklies  (SYN OTECHESTVA and others) -- will stop in the very near  future. According to reliable sources, Pavel Grachev has  approved a draft order abolishing the military press.    Officially the reason for closing army publications is  financial difficulties. According to another version, however,  the main reason lies in Grachev's unhappiness over the lukewarm  attitude by the subordinated press to his own personality,  especially in the past few months.</p>

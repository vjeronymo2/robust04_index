			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / QVC has its sights on Europe QVC, the television home shopping channel, is planning to expand into continental Europe with the possibility of local language channels in Germany, France and Italy. Mr William Schereck, president of QVC International and a close associate of QVC executive Mr Barry Diller, said yesterday that talks with potential partners were under way. 'Expect startling announcements within the next six months,' said Mr Schereck who is responsible for taking the QVC concept around the world. QVC has grown to a Dollars 1.2bn-a-year revenue business in the US in less than eight years. It was launched in the UK last October and a month later in Mexico. The company said it had reached agreement with the Dutch cable television association to transmit in the Netherlands and will launch in Norway in June, Denmark in June or July, and Sweden and Belgium by the end of the year. They will be serviced from the UK in English with the help of bilingual telephone operators. Mr Schereck said joint ventures and channels in French, German and Italian were the best way to tackle the biggest markets of Europe. He hoped to be able to launch such channels in those countries next year. Since its UK launch, the shopping channel estimates it has reached 4.5 per cent of its potential customers - a faster rate than in the US. There, the channel has signed up only 8 per cent of its potential customer base in eight years. Mr Schereck confirmed yesterday the UK channel was in line to reach its first year revenue target of Pounds 40m. The QVC channel has also had talks with a UK supermarket group about extending its range of 'impulse' buys, which include electrical goods, jewellery and sports equipment, to packages for Pounds 30 or Pounds 40 of non-perishable supermarket items such as cleaning equipment and canned goods.</p>

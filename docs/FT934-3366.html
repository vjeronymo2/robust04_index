			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Minford attacks revival package Professor Patrick Minford, the Liverpool University monetarist economist and one of the government's 'seven wise men', has attacked plans for spending Pounds 630m of European Union money to reconstruct the Merseyside economy, Ian Hamilton Fazey writes. He says the plans could make the region worse off by training workers for jobs that do not exist, so equipping them to migrate elsewhere in Britain with marketable skills. Merseyside, after final negotiations, is expected to receive the money over six years from next spring. This follows its designation at the last EU summit as one of Europe's poorest areas, qualifying it for Objective 1 status for EU funding. Prof Minford and his colleague Mr Peter Stoney say in their twice-yearly regional economic review that large sections of private industry were excluded from the preparation of the government's final bid document for the money. They attack the document's over-emphasis on training, for which 47 per cent of the money is being earmarked.</p>

			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Film offers fresh fruit longer life full of travel FRESH FRUIT, flower and vegetable growers face a dilemma if the markets for their products are far away. Sending perishable goods, like peaches, by air is expensive, but prolonged cold-storage leads to a loss of juiciness and 'bloom'. Research for Australian National Line, the Melbourne-based shipping group, has led to the development of an 'active wrapping' which can keep perishable goods fresh for several weeks, enabling them to be sent by ordinary sea transport and cutting growers' costs substantially. 'Essentially the wrapping puts the fruit to sleep,' said Mr Simon Crean, Australia's Minister for Primary Industry at a recent product demonstration. 'It controls the gases surrounding the fruit so that the biological processes are greatly slowed for the duration of the voyage. The ripening process and normal plant respiration are put into suspended animation.' The new material has four elements. A permeable membrane lets through the precise amount of carbon dioxide gas and oxygen to keep the product dormant. Then it is impregnated with an organic chemical which soaks up ethylene gas exuded by vegetable matter which hastens ripening. In addition, it keeps the air around the product very humid, while removing moisture which condenses inside the package. Finally, the wrapping is impregnated with minute amounts of slow release fungicide which inhibits mould growth. Australian National Line, Australia 61 3 869 5555.</p>

			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / Food &amp; Drink (The American Way): California dreaming An enjoyable part of my job is answering readers' queries about where to eat. But recently I was asked a more general question by a restaurateur who will be opening a large restaurant on London's South Bank this autumn. He was planning to send his chef on a restaurant research programme and wanted to know where I would suggest. Five years ago the answer would have been a tour of France. Two or three years ago I would have said northern Italy. Today my immediate response was California - with a stop-over in New York. I suggested this itinerary not just for the pleasure of eating Jeremiah Tower's food at Stars, San Francisco, or finding what Alice Waters was up to at Chez Panisse in Berkeley, or of negotiating the culinary maelstrom generated by Manhattan's 13,000 eating places. The main reason was to see what makes food in the US so attractive, exciting and affordable. What American chefs and restaurateurs have done, more successfully than any other country's, over the past decade, is look at the entire eating-out experience - from the consumers' view as well as their own. In doing so they have started with several advantages. First, America is the world's largest, most efficient food producer - but for ambitious chefs bigger and cheaper does not necessarily mean better. Led by Alice Waters, American chefs have dictated what they want: the best local produce grown for flavour and an emphasis on regional dishes prepared with the best local ingredients. Second, restaurateurs owe a great deal to the American wine industry. The American Institute of Food and Wine, based in Santa Barbara and the brainchild of Julia Child and wine makers Dick Graff and Robert Mondavi, has educated thousands of customers and trained many chefs. The Beringer winery in Napa runs a course which professional chefs are keen to join. In Mendocino, the Fetzer winery uses talented chef John Ash to cook its own organically-grown produce to match its organically-produced wines. Such a symbiosis cannot happen in the UK. Perhaps the most important, factor is the enthusiasm of the American diner. It was 33 years ago that Julia Child became America's first television cook. She has converted millions to the joys of good food. In the US today not only do food and cookery programmes get considerable prominence on PBS, the educational channel, but Channel 54 has become the television food network. Millions of Americans buy Gourmet and Bon Appetit magazines every month - in contrast to the UK which is still without a really successful independent food, wine and leisure magazine. American restaurateurs have more than matched their customers' enthusiasm for better food and service and have overcome major obstacles with a typically American 'can-do' philosophy. When the neo-Prohibitionist lobby threatened to dent sales of alcohol, American restaurateurs were the first to offer a comprehensive range of wines by the glass. Drink less but better has been a successful marketing campaign. When the going got rough, tough American restaurateurs got going. With the recession causing the prospect of thousands of empty tables in the spring and summer of 1992, some 100 New York restaurateurs devised and promoted the Dollars 19.92 lunch which filled tables and rekindled demand. Two final snippets whetted my appetite for a culinary trip around the US. The first was a late-night discussion with Jean-Georges Vongerichten, one of New York's most exciting chefs. In addition to his two restaurants, Jo-Jo's and Vong's, Vongerichten plans to open a third in the autumn, where you will pick up a trolley at the door, buy fish, whole and filleted, which you can take home and cook or it will be cooked for you. Finally, there will be a restaurant proper. This weekend menus arrived for dinners to be held in Chicago which exemplify the style of cooking which makes eating out in America so exciting. The celebrated chef Charlie Trotter will be cooking yellowtail tuna, marinated with chilli and sizzling sesame oil, diver-harvested scallops with charred bell pepper tapenade, organically-raised venison with sweet potato tortellini and, as a dessert, a poached plum with star anise ice cream. But an airline ticket was not included.</p>

			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Prospects improve for Lloyd's Names deal PROSPECTS for a negotiated end to legal action involving more than 2,000 Names - the individuals whose capital backs underwriting at the Lloyd's insurance market - brightened yesterday. After a lawsuit lasting more than 3 1/2 years, about 500 Names reached an out-of-court settlement with the CJ Warrilow agency and more than 20 other agents. The settlement has increased the possibility that separate negotiations, understood to be under way in a case being brought by nearly 1,000 Names against RHM Outhwaite and more than 80 other agents, could also be successful. Names are alleging that negligence by their agents and, in one case, by the Lloyd's Corporation, the body which provides regulatory and market back-up services, was responsible for their insurance losses in these two and four other cases. Outhwaite Names have lost more than Pounds 200m as a result of claims arising from US legal awards to victims of asbestosis. Last Monday, hearings in the Outhwaite case, which began in October, were suspended for a week for 'administrative reasons'. The talks were reported to have taken place between the Names and their agents. 'There is no doubt in my mind that they have stood down to allow the parties to settle,' said one solicitor. The enormous complexity of these cases, and the cost and time involved, has made them unwieldy, said another solicitor. 'My feeling is that these cases are just untriable,' he added. In the Warrilow case, errors and omissions insurers, who cover agents against legal awards for negligence, agreed to pay Names Pounds 4m, including Pounds 1.5m already paid in legal costs. The Warrilow syndicate ran up losses of more than Pounds 60m in 1984. However, Mr Tom Benyon, chairman of the Warrilow Names' association, said the most Names could hope to win in the legal case was Pounds 8.5m. 'It is not all we wanted but we have to be pragmatic,' he added. Mr Benyon said Lloyd's played a part in 'creating the atmosphere to make the settlement possible'.</p>

			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar and sterling lose ground THE DOLLAR weakened against most European currencies, but was little changed against sterling and improved in terms of the yen yesterday. The Federal Reserve, as expected, added funds to the New York banking system, via two-day system repurchase agreements, when Federal funds were trading at 6 3/16 per cent. Tax payments contributed to a tightening of credit conditions in New York, pushing the Fed funds rate above the assumed target of 6 per cent, after a period of recent weakness and action by the authorities to drain liquidity. Figures on US housing starts and industrial production in March painted a conflicting picture of the economy and had little impact. Construction of homes fell 9.3 per cent in March, after a revised drop of 17.2 per cent in February. This was weaker than expected. A fall of 0.3 per cent in industrial production, compared with a 0.9 per cent decline in February, was smaller than generally forecast. Capacity utilisation was running at 78.7 per cent in March, against 79.1 per cent the previous month. The data did little to indicate when or if the Fed will ease its monetary stance after recent weak inflation and employment figures. At the London close the dollar had fallen to DM1.6650 from DM1.6755; to SFr1.4175 from SFr1.4230; and to FFr5.6275 from FFr5.6550, but rose to Y134.80 from Y134.45. Its index rose to 64.5 from 64.3. Despite concern about the economic situation in east Germany and political unrest in the Soviet Union, the D-Mark was firmer, encouraged by doubts on the timing of any Fed easing, speculation about lower Japanese interest rates and profit-taking in sterling. The German currency rose to Y80.95 from Y80.25 against the yen, boosted by a claim from a Japanese news agency that the Bank of Japan is about to nudge short-term rates lower. A Bank of Japan official responded by saying: 'We haven't been tightening money rates, and so there is no way we could ease,' but the yen weakened, with the dollar rising above Y135.00 in Tokyo. Sterling fell back on profit-taking, after failing to break through DM3.00 against the D-Mark on Monday, but itremained the second strongest member of the European exchange rate mechanism. The pound declined to DM2.9775 from DM2.9975. It also fell to FFr10.0650 from FFr10.1150 and to SFr2.5350 from SFr2.5450, but was steady against the dollar, easing 5 points to Dollars 1.7885. Sterling's index lost 0.4 to 92.9. The Spanish peseta eased slightly at the top of the ERM and was fixed in Paris below its ceiling against the French franc for the first time in 10 days. A news agency report quoted a Bank of Spain spokesman as saying all remaining exchange controls will be scrapped ahead of a 1993 deadline set by the European Community.</p>

			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / People: DTI enlists the great and the good for its governance committee The Department of Trade and Industry has announced its committee of the Great and the Good to examine whether relations between investing institutions and UK corporations can be improved. Committee chairman is Paul Myners, the sometimes outspoken chairman of Gartmore, the fund management company, who is viewed as a hawk on matters of corporate governance. Discussing the committee's role, Myners takes a diplomatic stance: 'I think it is primarily an issue of communication (between shareholders and corporate management). But it can mean that managers are hesitant about committing capital to long-term projects.' However, whether the committee offers a radical solution to the perceived problems of short-termism in investment remains to be seen. The members, drawn from leading corporations and investment houses, can come up with meaningful suggestions. 'The challenge will be for us to produce something interesting,' concedes one member. Other members are Hugh Collum, finance director at SmithKline Beecham, who has served there since the early 1980s and is credited with helping restore the company's fortunes. He is also a former chairman of the influential 100 Group of Finance Directors which at times has been at loggerheads with shareholders over corporate governance issues. Also on the committee are Bernard Harty of the Chamberlain Corporation of London which advises local authority pension funds, Huw Jones, director of corporate finance at Prudential Portfolio Managers and chairman of the Association of British Insurers Investment Committee. Also present are James Joll, finance director of Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, and Richard Lapthorne, currently finance director at British Aerospace who came to his post from Courtaulds following BAe's ousting of its former chairman Roland Smith. Other committee members are Colin Lever, head of the investment division at actuarial consultants Bacon and Woodrow, Geoff Lindey, head of UK institutional investment at JP Morgan Investment Management and chairman of the National Association of Pension Funds investment committee, and William Stuttaford, chairman of the European division of Invesco, who formerly headed Framlington, the fund management company.</p>

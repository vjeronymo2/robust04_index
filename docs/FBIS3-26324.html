The content of the joint news bulletin is as follows:    Tang Shubei, executive vice chairman of the ARATS, and Zou  Zhekai, vice chairman and secretary general of the ARATS, held  talks with Chiao Jen-ho, resident vice president and secretary  general of the corporate SEF, in Beijing from 1 to 5 February,  discussing topics concerning the operation of the two  organizations, other operational matters, and other issues. The  two sides have reached a common understanding as stated below:    1. Both sides maintain that they should adopt a pragmatic  attitude and avoid political issues in the talks between them on  operational matters. The two sides have just discussed three  topics concerning operational matters, including the "issue of  repatriation of personnel entering the other side's domain in  violation of the relevant regulations and other concerned  matters." They have reached a very close, common understanding  in this regard, but efforts have yet to be made to iron out some  differences between them so that a written agreement can be  concluded as soon as possible. The two sides have agreed to  hold the fourth round of talks on operational matters in Beijing  in the latter half of March, and an agreement, if concluded,  will be signed by the persons in charge of the two parties in  Taipei. During the fourth round of talks on operational  matters, the two sides will also exchange views on or discuss  the following areas: The issue "of joint operation against  smuggling and robbery at sea and other criminal activities," the  issue of "mutual protection of intellectual property rights,"  "contact and mutual assistance between courts on the two shores  of the strait (mutual assistance between judicial organs on the  two shores of the strait)," and certain topics concerning the  fields of economy and science and technology that are listed in  the "Joint Agreement of the Wang Daohan-Ku Chengfu talks."    2. The two sides have agreed on the "procedures to  accommodate exchange of visits by staff of the ARATS and the SEF  between the two shores," which have come into effect by an  exchange of documents.    3. The two sides have agreed in principle to expand the  range  of variety of copies of notarial documents to be exchanged  between the two shores, in accordance with Article 2 of the  "Agreement on the Use and Verification of Notarial Documents  Between the Two Shores." Further discussion will be held to set  out detailed procedures.    4. The two sides will extend assistance to each other on  inheritance matters.    5. The two sides have agreed to make continued efforts this  year to promote exchanges of visits between mass media leading  staff members, young people, and scientific and technological  personnel on the two shores of the strait.    The two sides will continue to comprehensively implement all  the agreements concluded through the Wang Daohan-Ku Chengfu  talks, keep the contact and negotiating channels operating  smoothly between them, and thus pave the way for the second Wang  Daohan-Ku Chengfu talks.</p>

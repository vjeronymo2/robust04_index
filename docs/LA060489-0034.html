			<p><P> June 4, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACK: DONNY OSMOND "DONNY OSMOND." CAPITOL * 1/2: POP STARS ***** GREAT  BALLS OF FIRE **** KNOCKIN' ON HEAVEN'S DOOR *** GOOD VIBRATIONS ** MAYBE BABY  * AIN'T THAT A SHAME  </P> <P> Most of this album is as bad as you'd expect -- but not for the reasons you'd  expect. Osmond has the reputation for being a bland, soulless singer. His  vocals, however, aren't the main flaw in this collection of rather dreary pop  songs. The problem is primarily inferior material and thoroughly unimaginative,  one-dimensional production -- particularly on the up-tempo songs. His Top 5  pop/dance hit "Soldier of Love" works because of the punchy arrangement -- and  in spite of his tepid vocals. But, except for a few lapses, his singing is  generally passable, and on a few ballads even praiseworthy, showing some  strength and honest feeling. With the right material and production, Osmond  just might turn out a very good pop album. Dennis Hunt  </P></p>

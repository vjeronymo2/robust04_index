			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague May 4 (CTK) -- Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus  said today that measuring the level of democracy in the Czech  Republic by the number of non-profit-making organisations had  been the greatest misunderstanding since the fall of communism  in November 1989.    Speaking with journalists after a government session, he  said  that in the article he was preparing for the independent daily  LIDOVE NOVINY he would engage in a polemic with those "who  express their aversion of profitability through  non-profitability." Klaus said that in the title of his  article, which will read "The More Non-Profit Organisations, the  More Democracy," he would quote an unnamed author. He dismissed  speculation that the unnamed author was President Vaclav Havel  who had often taken up the status and role of non-profit  organisations.    At a press conference on March 26, Havel said that he  considered non-profit organisations one of the instruments of  building a civic society. "The social organism must be immune  to the excessive concentration of political power and it is  necessary to prevent that any change following elections produce  a windstorm and that it shake the whole state," Havel said at  the press conference.    Culture Minister Pavel Tigrid said after his meeting with  Havel yesterday that Havel wanted to discuss the drafting of a  bill on non-profit organisations in a public television debate.  Havel has been eagerly pushing for the law, while Klaus and  some other leading officials have been rather reserved on the  problem fearing big tax evasions.</p>

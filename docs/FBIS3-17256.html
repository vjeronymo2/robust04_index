A number of important bilateral  documents aimed at developing cooperation between the two  countries were signed on Wednesday evening.    At a solemn ceremony in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs  Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana Madariga and Vice-Prime  Minister Syzdyk Abishev and Foreign Minister of Kazakhstan  Tuleutay Suleymanov signed a declaration on the principles of  mutual relations between Kazakhstan and Spain, a treaty on  mutual encouragement and protection of investments and an  agreement on cooperation in the spheres of economy and  production.    The declaration emphasised that political, economic and  social changes taking place within the international relation  framework should be accompanied by more closer cooperation  between the two states in the interests of ensuring peace,  stability, progress and social well-being of their people. The  document reflects aspirations of the two countries to develop  international cooperation in the spheres of education, culture,  protection of the environment and fight against drug trafficking.    Addressing a press conference, Solana and Abishev emphasised  that the signed documents open new prospects for mutual  cooperation in many spheres. Notwithstanding the interest  displayed by both sides in the development of trade and economic  ties, the turnover between Spain and Kazakhstan was worth only  181.5 thousand U.S. dollars in 1993. This entire sum was spent  on imports of foodstuffs from Spain. Only two Spanish-Kazakh  joint ventures out of a total 2,000 registered in the republic  have been set up. These figures cited by Abishev also had their  impact on journalists.</p>

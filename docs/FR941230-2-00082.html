In addition, any wholesaler who obtains a license for distilled spirits wholesaling is prohibited from retailing such products. Topa entered the wholesale distilled spirits business in the Virgin Islands through a predecessor company in 1980 and thereafter made a series of acquisitions of competitors. Topa now imports most of the distilled spirits products sold within the Virgin Islands. (Only a few brands of distilled spirits are produced within the Virgin Islands.) Wholesalers like Topa purchase distilled spirits products from suppliers, store them in warehouses, and sell them to retailers who, in turn, sell to consumers in retail outlets. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the world distilled spirits market, liquor suppliers often grant exclusive distribution rights to wholesalers. In the Virgin Islands, wholesalers generally hold exclusive distribution rights for the distilled spirits products that they sell. The distribution rights usually are limited to the Virgin Islands. Exclusive distribution rights for some of the most popular brands are important to the success of a Virgin Islands distilled spirits wholesaler. It is difficult, however, to obtain a brand that is already being distributed by another wholesaler in the area, in part because a Virgin Islands law, Title 12A V.I.C. Sections 131 and 132, allows a dealer to sue a supplier for wrongful termination. Topa has the exclusive distribution rights in the Virgin Islands for almost every popular brand of distilled spirits available in the world market. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Most retail distilled spirits business in the Virgin Islands takes place on the island of St. Thomas. On St. Thomas, warehouse space suitable for the operation of a wholesale distilled spirits business is scarce and expensive because of the restricted terrain. An entrant in the Virgin Islands wholesale distilled spirits market would need adequate and accessible storage space for its distilled spirits products on St. Thomas to have a successful business. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The potential for litigation under the Virgin Islands wrongful termination statute helps to protect Topa's exclusive rights to distribute the various brands of distilled spirits in the Virgin Islands and makes it difficult for a potential or existing competitor to obtain the rights to distribute these brands. This potential for litigation and the scarcity of warehouse space on St. Thomas are among the most important barriers to entry which make entry for a competitor difficult and costly, and significant entry into the Virgin Islands wholesale distilled spirits market has not occurred in at least ten years. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / Conoco joint venture starts to pump oil from Russian field: Project is small but carries considerable symbolic importance The Polar Lights joint venture between Conoco and Archangelskgeologia, which started producing oil in the virgin tundra of northern Russia yesterday, is being hailed as a beacon of hope amid the gloom that shrouds the Russian oil industry. When the Soviet Union fell apart, Conoco was just one of droves of western oil companies which came to Russia with high hopes of breaking into what was the world's biggest crude oil and gas producer. Many other oilmen are now heading home disillusioned with the legislative and bureaucratic frustrations. Conoco and Archangelskgeologia have succeeded where others have failed largely through sheer persistence - and some useful political backing from Presidents Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin. Their Ardalin field is the first to be developed by a joint venture company and the partners hope to make a good return on their Dollars 375m investment by selling the oil abroad. Representatives of other western oil companies in Moscow suggest the achievement should not be underestimated nor should the deal's symbolism be ignored. But, they stress, it is important to set the deal in context: the investment is relatively small; big risks remain. By global industry standards, the Ardalin field, 1,000 miles northeast of Moscow, is minuscule, with peak production of 25,000 barrels a day expected by 1996. The exploration risks have also been slight. Russian geologists discovered oil reserves in the Timan Pechora basin years ago but did not exploit them as the central economic planners directed resources towards western Siberia. Moreover, the field is relatively straightforward to exploit despite being located in the Arctic Circle. While proud at what has been achieved to date, the cheery Mr Constantine Nicandros, Conoco's president and chief executive, is realistic about what remains left to do. 'Ardalin is interesting but we would not have come to Russia just to do this project. There are far bigger fields in the northern area waiting to be developed. You could be looking at another Alaska, a second Prudhoe Bay. Although there is not one individual field, the Timan Pechora region could produce about 5bn-10bn barrels,' he says. Conoco is studying projects which would require a further Dollars 5bn of gross investment. Four other western companies, Amoco, Texaco and Exxon from the US, and Norsk Hydro from Norway, have also been co-operating on developing reserves in the the same Nenets region while Shell and Saga are also aiming to develop other fields nearby. The companies are studying whether it would be feasible to build an offshore terminal handling about 450,000 barrels a day at a cost of Dollars 2bn. But before committing such sums, the companies say they need a change in Russian tax and business legislation. 'Only when the legal system in this country changes, such that we can operate with confidence, can we be optimistic that we can develop this region,' says one consortium member. Even the Ardalin field could fall victim to the ever-changing legislative regime. The project's viability is dependent on the continuation of a temporary energy ministry waiver, specifically for the project, of the customary Dollars 5 a barrel export tax. Polar Lights also relies on a precarious web of 10 interlocking contracts to sell oil abroad. Because Polar Lights does not yet have a direct pipeline to the west, it is obliged to swap its oil with other Russian producers with access to western markets. 'We all had doubts about this arrangement and those doubts remain. The difficulties of getting oil to a western customer makes things very complicated,' says Mr Anatoly Kazakov, general director of Archangelskgeologia. The lack of rouble convertibility and the artificially low price of oil within Russia would ruin the project's economics if those export arrangements broke down. Russian nationalists are also hostile to granting production licences to western companies. But the counter-argument is that Russia's economic self-interest will prevail. Mr Kazakov says his company and Russian federal and local governments will receive 70 per cent of the Dollars 2bn income the Ardalin field is expected to generate over the next 16 years. Without such income, he suggests, the Russian government cannot afford to develop the industry by itself. Already the government has delayed Rbs10bn (Pounds 3m at the market rate) of payments to Archangelskgeologia, meaning many of its workers have not been paid. 'The government should declare itself bankrupt,' Mr Kozakov says with grim humour. That may leave an opportunity for western companies. Mr Nicandros is certainly convinced of the possibility. 'Russia is probably still the biggest oil and gas producer in the world,' he says, 'and to ignore it means you are not going to participate in a significant part of the global business. There are risks. But you can analyse these things to death and it will just be what it will be. All you can do is make your best judgment at the time.'</p>

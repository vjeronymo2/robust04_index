			<p>BFN     [Text] Ruse, March 16 (BTA) -- The Intergovernmental  Bulgarian-Romanian Commission on Environmental Protection opened  its first working session in Ruse (on the Danube) this morning.  The delegations are led by Bulgaria's Deputy Environment  Minister Khristo Dalchev and Romania's State Secretary of the  Ministry of Waters, Forestry and Environmental Protection Ioan  Jelev [name as received]. Projects on an improvement of the  technological and technical condition of industrial facilities  and the integrated system of environment monitoring and control  in the areas of Silistra and Calarasi, Ruse and Giurgiu, and  Nikopol and Turnu Magurele were on the agenda. This is the  first in a series of working meetings on a joint programme of  environmental protection in the Danube area.    The European Commission is ready to assist the  Bulgarian-Romanian integrated environment programme in the  shared section of the River Danube, Mr. Dalchev said.    He has received a letter from Mr. Alan Mayhew, head of a  working group with the commission, who welcomes the memorandum  signed in Giurgiu on December 27, 1993 by the Bulgarian and the  Romanian environment ministers. Mr. Mayhew was expressly  informed of the Ruse meeting of the mixed commission and  believes that it would be useful for the sides to agree on a way  in which the process of bilateral cooperation would be  facilitated with the help of the PHARE [Economic and  Reconstruction Aid for Poland and Hungary] Programme. Mr.  Mayhew suggests future trilateral meetings between  representatives of Bulgaria, Romania and the Commission. Mr.  Dalchev said that he was not only inspired with hope by this  first EU reaction to the memorandum but was also confident of  positive results in the future.</p>

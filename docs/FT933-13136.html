			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / Britain's oil rig industry is in danger of collapse BRITAIN'S oil rig industry is in danger of collapse after losing 15,000 of its 20,000-strong workforce over the past 15 months, a group of MPs claimed yesterday. Two yards are on 90 days notice of closure and one is open on a care-and-maintenance basis only, Mr Henry McLeish, Labour MP for Fife Central, said. MPs from all parties called on the government to safeguard existing yards which are facing growing competition from overseas and possible cutbacks because of changes in North Sea taxes. The MPs called for the proposed changes to petroleum revenue taxes to be suspended.</p>

			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / Staff vetting may use criminal records A NEW basis for the use of criminal records as a way to vet employees is suggested by the government in a consultation paper published yesterday. While the idea of creating an independent agency to administer vetting arrangements appears likely to win support, the suggestion that it might be privatised will prove more controversial. The paper also proposes legislation to allow the police to charge for making checks on prospective employees' criminal records, and puts forward new criteria for vetting checks. These include extending existing rules to protect the vulnerable, such as children and the elderly, from rogue applicants for posts in childrens' homes, sheltered accomodation and other social services and charitable work. Under the proposals the arrangements for giving information on local police records could be tightened to define more closely both the matters that can be disclosed and the posts for which such checks could be made. A full charge for vetting is estimated to be about Pounds 12 for a check of national records, while a check of local records as well would cost about Pounds 17. The police currently carry out about 900,000 checks a year, some two thirds of which are for child-protection. The paper acknowledges that when MPs recommended the creation of an independent agency they envisaged that it would be in the public sector, but argues that there is no reason why the private sector should not run the service. Disclosure of criminal records for employment vetting purposes. HMSO. Pounds 7.10.</p>

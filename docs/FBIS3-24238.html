			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Natalya Kuzina: "Does Russia Need Procurators </F> and Judges Who Only Obey the Law?"]    [Text] There was a time when the representatives of the law  needed celebrated cases and brilliant articles for fame.  Everything is much simpler now. One only needs to observe the  Constitution, and fame along with a position will cover you.  Aleksey Kazannik, Valeriy Zorkin and, incidentally, even  Valentin Stepankov proved that brilliantly.    Unfortunately, another question has remained opened: In  today's Russia, can one combine observance of the law with a  high position? Following the logic of the radical reformers and  their popularizers, one cannot. During a recent television  broadcast about A. Kazannik, they literally passed sentence -- a  political Don Quiote -- with some sympathy for the former  general procurator. He did not understand that they had brought  him "upstairs" not for his professional qualities but only  because he once did the president a good turn -- namely, a  service. Personal devotion is the priority requirement for an  official.    What does this mean in the judicial system? With the  departure of people dedicated to the law from its "upper"  stories, a complete failure awaits the system. Those who keep to  the letter of the law will help. Already, there are not enough  judges and people's assessors now. They are on the run under the  threats of corrupted bureaucrats and legalized criminals. Only,  where should the main mass of the population, from whom they  have consistently and step by step taken away all the  departments for protecting them beginning with our almost  home-spun local trade union committees and ending with the  opportunity to achieve justice in a court where one had not come  with a purse, run?    This summer, I had an occasion to ask V. Zorkin how he would  have acted if something similar to the celebrated OPUS [Osoboye  Poryadok Upravleniya Stranoy--play on word "opus", meaning  "work"] appeared again?    The answer was:    "I would have acted according to the constitution."    V. Zorkin proved this in the fall which does not now make  him  completely happy.    The Constitutional Court is still closed down. An  individual,  who is personally devoted but undergoing a libel case, is  performing the duties of general procurator. The Constitution,  even if it is a presidential one, leaves too broad a field for  interpretation.</p>

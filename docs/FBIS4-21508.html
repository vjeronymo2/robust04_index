			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [EC Document No DOC/IP/94/155: "Importation of Ozone </F> Depleting Substances into the European Union"]    [Text] The recent Commission decision (no. 94/84/EC)  concerning the quantity and allocation of imports into the  Community of ozone depleting substances does not increase the  damage to the ozone layer, nor represent an easing of European  policy on this matter as has been alleged recently by certain  European producers of these substances.    The Commission wishes to stress that the quantities of  virgin  substances for dispersive uses which may be imported into the  Community remain in strict conformity with Council regulation  (EEC) no. 549/91 as amended. The other imports allowed under  the decision are only for either "feedstock" uses, which do not  damage the ozone layer because they are permanently altered in  the chemical process, or for used and recycled substances, which  by providing an alternative to new production of CFC's and other  controlled substances, have allowed ozone depleting substances  to be phased-out more rapidly. Both types of imports are  permitted and encouraged by the Montreal Protocol on ozone  depleting substances. These imports have been authorized after  full consultation with the ministries responsible for  environmental protection of the member states in accordance with  Council Regulation (EEC) no. 594/91.    The Commission takes great care to distinguish between  imports of used and recycled substances and those of virgin  substances. All companies wishing to import used and recycled  substances are vetted by the relevant ministries of the member  states. Every cargo of controlled substances is only permitted  into the Community if it is accompanied by a valid import  licence, and if a company is found to have undertaken illegal  imports, import licences are withheld and legal action may be  instigated by the member states.    In addition, since the beginning of this year, further  information specifying the source and destination companies of  used and recycled substances is required by the Commission  before an import license is issued.    The other imports do not add to the European Union's  consumption of CFC's, or of any of the ozone depleting  substances, because neither type of import is treated as  consumption within the terms of the Montreal Protocol.    The provisions under the protocol regarding production for  "feedstock" uses and for the trade of used and recycled  substances, also benefit European producers. They are permitted  to produce unlimited quantities of CFC's and other substances  provided these are for feedstock use, and they can also play an  active role in the recycling of used substances.    Commissioner Paleokrassas would like to take this  opportunity  to stress that the Union has taken a leading position in the  fight against ozone depleting substances by anticipating the  dates of phasing out of the ozone depleting substances agreed in  the Montreal protocol.</p>

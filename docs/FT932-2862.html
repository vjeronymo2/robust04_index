			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Outcome of motion hinges on Hata's vote JAPAN'S ruling Liberal Democratic party faces a showdown today over the reform of the country's scandal-stained political system, as opposition parties have promised to launch a no-confidence motion against Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, and his cabinet. If the motion is successful, Mr Miyazawa will be forced to dismiss the cabinet or call a general election, prospects which prompted concern yesterday among business leaders. The outcome of a no-confidence vote will hinge on Mr Tsutomu Hata, the former finance minister who heads a pro-reform LDP faction. He has indicated he is prepared to abstain from the vote. If the members of Mr Hata's faction choose to abstain, the LDP will still have a small majority in the lower house, but if they vote against the party the balance will be tipped and the Miyazawa cabinet will fall. Mr Miyazawa had previously threatened to call an election if a no-confidence motion was formally proposed, but his advisers were attempting to reach a compromise with LDP reformers last night, fearing that the party would be badly bruised if a snap election was called.</p>

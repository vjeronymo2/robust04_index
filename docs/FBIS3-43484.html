			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Domingos Hungo, governor of Cuando Cubango </F> Province, by unidentified reporter; place and date not  given--recorded]    [Text] [Reporter] Good evening, Governor Hungo. Cuando  Cubango Province is often referred to as the land at the end of  the world. Do you agree with that name?    [Hungo] Yes, you are quite right. It is really the land at  the end of the world.    [Reporter] The military situation appears to be taking on  difficult overtones?    [Hungo] Yes, it is true, the military situation is becoming  somewhat complex because the enemy, the National Union for the  Total Independence of Angola [UNITA], continues to siege the  farming areas where the people go to fetch food. UNITA  continues to train men in its old bases. Relatively low  intensity shelling continues to claim lives, as do ambushes and  mines. We would have liked to take advantage of the opportunity  we have been given. If there is no peace, it will be tragic for  the people of Cuando Cubango Province, who have had to endure  this protracted war.    [Reporter] Governor Hungo: How do you reconcile the fact  that UNITA is attending the Lusaka peace talks while attacking  your province?    [Hungo] We have known UNITA for a long time now and UNITA  has  always behaved like this. At a time when talks are under way,  UNITA appears to feel compelled to show its military might so it  can participate in the talks on equal terms with the government.  Moreover, UNITA has always displayed bad faith in relation to  the Angolan people, thereby showing its poor political  capabilities and its failure to accept the democratic game.    [Reporter] Mr. Governor Hungo: Do you think that the peace  proclaimed by UNITA is false?    [Hungo] We must see to believe. I am not trying to weave any  tales here. I have known UNITA since 1964 and our relations  have always led to dead ends. We discuss peace, peace, and  peace yet again, and it has been 30 years that UNITA has  prevented us from enjoying peace. I think that we must really  see to believe, but seeing all their twists and turns I am less  than confident. Let me give you the concrete example of Malange  yesterday: If they were really interested in signing a  cease-fire accord and bringing peace to the Angolan people, they  would not have shelled Malange yesterday. There were U.S.  congressmen visiting the city and the United States backed UNITA  for a long time.    [Reporter] Mr. Governor: And how has Cuando Cubango Province  been defended?    [Hungo] I am happy about the way defensive operations have  been organized in my province. Together with the civilian  defense force, the defense and security troops have been  indefatigable in their preparedness. This has meant that our  troops have become more organized and more experienced. I can  even tell you that we are ready for anything at any time. With  the help of the central government, we shall take the  appropriate steps to defend Cuando Cubango Province.    [Reporter] The land at the end of the world...    [Hungo] That is correct!</p>

			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei scores marginal gain on hopes of rate cut THE NIKKEI average scored a marginal gain in low volume, as investors remained sidelined ahead of today's announcement of the government's package to stimulate the economy, which is expected to include a cut in the official discount rate, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue average ended 32.32 up at 19,669.31. The index set a day's low of 19,445.91 on light selling, but rose to the day's high of 19,807.31 late in the afternoon on index buying. Volume eased to 170m shares from 180m, remaining below the 200m level for three consecutive trading days. Overall declines were just ahead of rises by 475 to 454, with 190 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks put on 2.02 to 1,430.15, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index edged up 0.93 to 1,121.29. Market participants remained inactive, expecting some volatility today, the last session of the fiscal year. A reduction in the discount rate by the Bank of Japan is also thought likely for today, along with the government's economic measures. Traders said investors were now focused on the size of the interest rate cut. Mr Chris Newton at James Capel said a 50 basis points cut, the market consensus, has already been discounted in share prices, and could prompt disappointed investors to sell. On the other hand, a 75 basis points reduction could give some strength to the market. A decline in short-term money market rates encouraged hopes of an imminent cut. The unsecured overnight call rate, which is heavily influenced by the Bank of Japan's money market operations, fell below 5 per cent for the first time since early 1989. The Nikkei remained volatile due to trading in low-liquidity component stocks in the index. Some traders with short positions on the Nikkei futures were seen trying to pull the index down by selling these issues. Daito Woollen Spinning and Weaving dropped Y79 to Y981 and Shimura Kako lost Y40 to Y740. Speculative issues, sold off heavily last week on rumours of financial difficulties at a non-bank financial institution, rallied on bargain hunting by short-term traders. Minebea, the most active issue of the day, rose Y24 to Y489, while Nippon Carbon added Y100 at Y1,200. Blue chips, depressed by selling for book-closing purposes last week, also gained ground on light bargain hunting. Fujitsu improved Y10 to Y674 and Nippon Steel Y5 to Y320. In Osaka, the OSE average slipped 107.14 to 21,161.89 in volume of 249.9m shares. Cross-trading by companies trying to realise profits ahead of the fiscal year-end pushed up activity. However, investors remained wary due to the lack of news. Roundup WEAKNESS on Wall Street on Friday and only a small improvement for Tokyo depressed the Pacific Rim yesterday. Taiwan was closed for a holiday. HONG KONG retreated in active trading as investors took profits following last week's blue-chip earnings reports. The Hang Seng index shed 29.31 to 4,978.27 and turnover declined to HKDollars 2.03bn from HKDollars 2.39bn. Hutchison Whampoa slipped 40 cents to HKDollars 15.30, Jardine Matheson 50 cents to HKDollars 47.50 and Cheung Kong 40 cents to HKDollars 21.80. MANILA responded positively to the announcement that Senator Joseph Estrada had abandoned his bid for the presidency, which reduced the probability of a minority government after the May 11 polls. The composite index rose 5.08 to 1,091.19 as turnover fell to 35m pesos from 56m pesos. The market was led by Manila Electric (Meralco) and the newly listed International Container Terminal Services. Meralco gained 4 pesos to 154 pesos, while ICTSI put on 70 centavos to 7.80 pesos. SEOUL slipped below 600, but shares with low price/earnings ratios continued to attract buyers. The composite index lost 4.97 to 597.69 in turnover of Won310.4bn, after Saturday's half-day Won256.4bn. SINGAPORE fell sharply in thin trading. The Straits Times Industrial index closed 13.02 down at 1,425.74 in turnover of SDollars 60m, down from SDollars 90.2m. KUALA LUMPUR extended last week's losses and sentiment was depressed by speculation that bank reserve requirements will be raised. The composite index finished 5.02 weaker at 597.69 in volume of 32.5m shares, after 42.3m. Tan Chong, the motor group, fell 22 cents to MDollars 3.20 after reporting lower 1991 earnings. AUSTRALIA saw quiet trade and the All Ordinaries index dipped 3 points to 1,573.4 in turnover of ADollars 125.5m. Santos, the oil and gas group, eased 2 cents to ADollars 2.59 on reporting a net loss of ADollars 110.9m. News Corp fell 24 cents to ADollars 17.54. NEW ZEALAND's NZSE-40 index shed 5.03 to 1,407.80 in estimated turnover of NZDollars 14m. BOMBAY soared on heavy buying, the BSE index hitting a record 4,159.53 before closing at 4,091.43, up 300.25.</p>

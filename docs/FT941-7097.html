			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / Labour row over poll candidate Labour party workers in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, yesterday accused the party's national executive committee of betraying the principles of one-member-one-vote by refusing to consider a popular local candidate to stand in the town's forthcoming by-election. Members of Rotherham's constituency Labour party said they were 'up in arms' over an NEC decision to draw up a short-list of candidates for the by-election without including Mr Peter Thirlwall. He was recently nominated as candidate by party members in five of the constituency's eight wards, and by a majority of local union branches. In accordance with Labour's rules the preliminary nominations were followed by interviews with a sub-committee of the NEC, which this week drew up a short-list on which the party can make its final vote. The sub-committee, which included Miss Margaret Beckett, the deputy leader, and Miss Hilary Armstrong, parliamentary private secretary to Mr John Smith, drew up a list of six candidates that did not include Mr Thirlwall. Among those chosen were Mr Denis MacShane, a well-known Labour party figure and veteran trade unionist. The NEC gave no reason for its decision to exclude Mr Thirlwall, who claims to belong to the party's mainstream. Mr Larry Whitty, the party's general secretary, said that each member of the short-list 'must be able to withstand the pressures which come from the national attention which will be given to this by-election'. The six individuals chosen had met the required criteria. Mr Thirlwall, an engineer with Rotherham Borough Council, said yesterday that he would easily have won the final ballot had he been nominated, and that this might have deprived the executive of pushing through a more favoured candidate. Ms Georgina Boyes, a member of the executive of the Rotherham constituency Labour party, said the decision had caused anguish among party members. She said: 'I think it's important that, having chosen OMOV as the main way of selecting candidates, the whole process should be considered carefully. Local wishes must be taken into account. The process is open to abuse.' Ms Boyes said that a recent meeting of the CLP's executive had voted overwhelmingly to demand Mr Thirlwall's inclusion in the final short-list. 'Ninety per cent of the executive are up in arms, if not more,' she said. Mr Whitty said last night that the NEC's decision was final.</p>

			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Wassall 21% ahead at Pounds 11.8m - Newly-acquired General Cable contributes Pounds 1.2m in just 22 days Wassall, the conglomerate that nearly trebled its annual sales with the Pounds 177m acquisition of US-based General Cable in June, increased pre-tax profits by 21 per cent to Pounds 11.8m in the six months to June 30. General Cable contributed a profit of Pounds 1.2m in 22 days and Mr Chris Miller, chief executive, predicted that it would enhance group earnings in its first year. Wassall has cut more than 20 per cent of General Cable's 300 strong head office and appointed a new chief executive in Mr Steven Rabinowitz, formerly with General Electric and Allied Signal. General Cable's huge copper stocks have already been reduced by 10 per cent. Wassall believes that eventually it will be able to hedge up to 70 per cent of its copper exposure, but meanwhile it is able to pass on the rising metal price to its customers. It also faces rising polypropylene and aluminium costs in its bottle tops business where Mr Miller admits price increases are very difficult to pass on. But he predicted the effects would be outweighed by continued volume growth. The closures division recorded 10 per cent volume growth in Europe, helped by good weather, expansion in eastern Europe and the success of Coca-Cola's new half litre bottle which is taking market share from cans. Closures profits rose to Pounds 5.43m (Pounds 4.96m) despite a downturn in South Africa reflecting the uncertainty and upheaval caused by the elections. Mr Miller forecast a better second half in South Africa and added: 'Business confidence is better than it has been for years though whether that translates into real orders remains to be seen.' Excluding General Cable and exchange rate movements the existing businesses increased operating profits by 29 per cent to Pounds 12m with the contribution from DAP, the US DIY products supplier, up 31 per cent to Pounds 4.99m. Turnover from the existing businesses rose to Pounds 137.6m (Pounds 133.1m) while General Cable contributed Pounds 42.6m. Earnings per share rose 15 per cent to 4.7p. The interim dividend is up 19 per cent to 1.15p. The shares fell 11p to 286p. COMMENT The slide in Wassall's share price yesterday had more to do with its strength since the General Cable deal than with any concerns about the figures. Virtually all the existing businesses are performing well and Mr Miller is so confident about General Cable that he said the group could take on another acquisition outside the US if the opportunity arose. He is predicting margins of 4 per cent at General Cable in 1995 which should power profits from around Pounds 36m this year to perhaps Pounds 52m. That puts the shares on a multiple of 22, falling to 17. Demanding certainly, but the Wassall team's record is hard to beat.</p>

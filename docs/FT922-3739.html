			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / Islamic murder awakes fears among Egyptian elite EGYPT'S liberal elite has been stunned by the Moslem extremist assassination on Monday in Cairo of Dr Farag Foda, the prominent secularist writer and campaigner against fundamentalism. Dr Foda was caught in a hail of bullets fired from an automatic rifle as he left his office in a Cairo suburb. He died later in hospital. One of his assailants was arrested. Mohammed Sayed Ahmed, a columnist for the daily Al Ahram, described the killing as 'an extremely serious development'. He said that the threat of Moslem extremism in the country was increasing 'exponentially'. Dr Foda's assassination coincides with a government crackdown on Islamic extremists, and follows serious communal disturbances recently in towns south of Cairo between Moslems and Christians, in which 13 people were killed. It also comes on the eve of another IMF-inspired round of price increases that are certain to fuel resentment among hard-pressed Egyptians as the long hot summer approaches. Ms Hala Mustapha, an expert on Islam at the Al Ahram Strategic Studies centre, described Dr Foda's slaying as 'a terrible thing'. An Egyptian had now been murdered for his 'opinions'. 'This is a dangerous tendency because one used to say that those groups were in conflict with the government,' she observed. 'But now it is not so: they are targeting any kind of view which is contrary to theirs.' 'This is without any doubt terrorism, an unprecedented incident that could threaten the whole society,' she added. 'This man could do nothing; he had no power, he was not a politician. All he had was his pen. . . .'' The assassination in broad daylight of Dr Foda by young men claiming membership of Islamic Jihad (the same group responsible for the murder in 1981 of President Anwar Sadat) is almost certain to force the Egyptian authorities into a further review of their strategy in dealing with Moslem extremism. The government has been seeking to co-opt mainstream Islamic groups by presenting itself as a custodian of Islamic values, while at the same time cracking down hard on fringe Islamic groups such as the Jihad which advocate violence. The banned but tolerated Moslem Brotherhood (Ikhwan) may also find itself under increased official pressure following the death of Dr Foda and indications recently that Islamic extremism is again on the rise in Egypt. Mr Maamoun Hodeibi, the leader of the Ikhwan in Egypt's parliament, said yesterday his organisation 'regretted' the incident, but blamed the government for allowing the public media to be used to attack Islam. 'The position of the government in general and that of the government-run media in particular is responsible for such an incident,' he declared. 'The government-run media has its writers who attack Islam. . . ' Dr Foda, 47, was easily the most prominent among Egyptian critics of Islamic extremism, and last week advocated the enactment of a special law to deal with terrorism. An unsuccessful candidate for Egypt's 1990 parliamentary elections, he declared in a campaign statement: 'I'm fighting terrorism. I'm not fighting the people who pray, but I'm fighting the people who abandoned dialogue and who fight now with the Kalashnikov.'</p>

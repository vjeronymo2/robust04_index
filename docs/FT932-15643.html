Collins Classics 20072 SLOWLY BUT surely Harrison Birtwistle is gaining the representation on disc his achievement deserves. Though The Mask of Orpheus remains too daunting a challenge for any record company to take on, most of his important scores are now accessible from one label or another; one of the most significant absentees, The Triumph of Time, is promised soon from Collins Classics, to be coupled with Gawain's Journey. The new NMC pairing of Meridian and Melencolia I, wonderfully performed and recorded, brings into the catalogue two of Birtwistle's most haunting and underrated works of the 1970s, scores that begin the exploration aspects of the highly wrought Orpheus sound world Melencolia I is a brooding study in string and wind sonority, setting a solo clarinet against two string orchestras with a harp to act as pivot and intermediary; a Durer engraving provides the visual starting point and the progress of the music is slow and remorseless, with sudden passionate flarings. Meridian, on the other hand, is perhaps the most perfectly achieved and sensuous of all Birtwistle's scores, a ravishing interweaving of settings of Thomas Wyatt and Christopher Logue with instrumental interludes in which solo horn and cello (long-standing Birtwistle protagonists) vie for attention. Between the two pieces is Ritual Fragment, Birtwistle's memorial to Michael Vyner, the much missed artistic director of the London Sinfonietta. It is a wonderful example of Birtwistle's matchless ability to create a compelling drama out of abstract ideas; here it is enacted by the Sinfonietta with all the concentration the piece and its purpose deserve. Birtwistle may still lack a full-blooded commitment from any one record company but Peter Maxwell Davies is well advanced on an extensive series of releases for Collins Classics. Stone Litany from 1973 and Black Pentecost (1979) framed Davies's 'Orkney period'. The earlier work sets off from a sequence of runic graffiti on a ravishing celebration of orchestral light and colour, full of iridescent textures and spangled lyricism; Black Pentecost, a passionate protest against the threat of uranium mining on the Orkney Islands, begins to show the symphonic tendencies that would come to dominate Davies's music a few years later. Sibelius is the reference point: the orchestral colours are sombre, the musical argument densely detailed. In an ideal recording the mezzo-soprano for Stone Litany would have a more luscious tone quality than Della Jones, but her involvement and dramatic sense provide more than adequate compensation, while David Wilson-Johnson proves an equally attentive partner in Black Pentecost. The BBC Philharmonic, thoroughly grounded in Maxwell Davies by Edward Downes, its former chief conductor, plays both scores for the composer with impressive strength and tonal resilience. The main disappointment with Decca's welcome release of Byzantium, Michael Tippett's Yeats setting written for Solti and the Chicago orchestra in 1989, is the coupling; dedicated Tippettians will already have the same performance of the Fourth Symphony as part of the set of symphonies put together on CD by Decca three years ago. When several works await up-to-date recordings - the Piano Concerto most significantly of all - a precious opportunity has gone to waste. For Byzantium alone, though, the disc is worth acquiring, for in this piece Tippett regained the verve and immediacy in his response to a text one feared had been lost for ever in the indulgences of his own libretto for the opera New Year. His reaction to Yeats' enchanted imagery is consistently vivid; however flaky the continuity and coherence of the musical structure, the parade of images is compelling. So too is Faye Robinson's performance, with Solti providing typically muscular orchestral support. The latest in Collins' series of 'CD singles' makes two much praised recent concertos speedily available. John Casken's Cello Concerto, written in 1991 for Heinrich Schiff to play and direct, emerges from this recording a much bigger, more passionate work than it seemed at its first performance, and if anything even more impressive. Its pair of movements is parsed into a sequence of episodes each springing from a single poetic phrase, and the work arcs towards its final section, when Casken uncovers a rich lyrical vein that extends everything that has gone before. Hugh Wood's Piano Concerto, a big hit at the Proms in 1991, seems a more tightly integrated, carefully worked score than it did then, centred on the set of variations on Nat King Cole's 'Sweet Lorraine' which forms the slow movement and whose source is only revealed towards the close. The rest - the propulsive opening movement, the jazz-inflected finale - offer effective solo writing, without ever hinting at the kind of personal utterance that Casken's concerto manages so memorably.</p>

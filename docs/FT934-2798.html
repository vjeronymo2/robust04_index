			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: High octane yields The rally in equities since the Budget runs counter to the normal trend. In part, that reflected the strongly anti-inflationary aspects of Mr Clarke's measures, with no extension of VAT and the brunt of deficit reduction falling on spending cuts. Falling oil prices have since further improved prospects. Expectations that interest rates may fall further and stay lower were reinforced by Mr Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England, who claims he is 'not an inflation nutter'. Gilts have understandably rallied, pulling equities up in their wake. The logic that the low yield on gilts is a support for equities is a strong pull on the market at present. Yet such relative valuation arguments can dissipate rapidly, and the market needs better corporate news for direct support. In the past three years, the FT-SE 100 index has risen by 50 per cent, while dividends are only up by 1 per cent. Dividend prospects are improving, but slowly, and several high profile companies have produced disappointing results. The number of analysts currently lowering profits forecasts strongly outnumbers those raising their estimates. Mr Clarke's measures will have done little to help domestic consumption next year, hence the fall in cyclical stocks and demand for higher-yielding utilities since the budget. Overseas earnings may well improve from the US, but that is probably already discounted in prices. Further improvement in UK equities next year may well depend on positive surprises from continental Europe.</p>

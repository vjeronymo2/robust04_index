			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / 'For sale' boards go up at mines FOR SALE OR LEASE: 20 coal mines, many loss-making and none wanted by their owner. Required to compete in a fast-shrinking market of uncertain size. Not perhaps the most tempting of public-sector assets to be offered to the private sector, but enough to have already attracted the attention of 22 companies which have expressed an interest to British Coal. In a month or so British Coal is likely to start advertising the first of the pits it is closing or mothballing for sale or lease. It will be another three or four months at least before the first of the companies takes control of a pit. The timetable must seem grindingly slow to companies such as RJB Mining and Edwards Energy, which are among the frontrunners. The apparent tardiness of the process has already been criticised by MPs. However, Mr Neil Clarke, the British Coal chairman, says that the corporation is moving as fast as possible. 'The principle is established: it is reasonable that if we have decided to close a colliery, we should make it available to someone else,' he said yesterday. He described the process as 'enormously complicated'. The corporation must take account of consultations with unions, competition law, the 1947 Nationalisation Act and the Transfer of Undertakings regulations of the European Community. There has been opposition by unions to the proposal by British Coal to consult on the closure of all 10 pits collectively. This particular issue is likely to be settled in the High Court. Only when the closure procedure for each pit is over will British Coal start the hiving-off process. Newspaper advertisements will invite expressions of interest, which will entitle a bidder to detailed information on a colliery and a chance to visit it. Shortly after that it will become clear which bidders are serious. Mr Ray Proctor, the British Coal executive heading the operation, said the corporation intended to operate a competitive open-tender system, with a 'pre-qualifying process'. He said: 'It will not be like sending off your application for a driving licence and getting it back within a few days. Success will not just depend on the level of someone's bid. We will be checking out the financial and technical competence of bidders.' British Coal is unlikely to look favourably upon companies intent on 'rape and pillage' operations - mining easily accessible coal but doing no development work. 'We do not want short-term bursts of output that will displace the coal of collieries with long-term prospects,' said Mr Proctor. The corporation will use consultants to help assess bidders and, said Mr Clark, to ensure that licensing is 'judicial rather than arbitrary'. Bidders will have to think long and hard before buying - the pits are being discarded by British Coal because there is apparently nowhere to sell their output. Nor will the size of the potential market become apparent until British Coal concludes contracts for additional tonnages with the electricity generators. That might not be achieved before October. Most independent operators expect to concentrate on niche markets. 'We are running a system that is geared to the electricity supply industry but gives some output for the domestic and industrial markets,' says Mr Proctor. 'They (the independents) are seeking to reverse that logic, with coal for electricity being the residual product.' Independent analysts believe opportunities are limited. 'I would be surprised if half a dozen of the 20 were licensed off,' said one yesterday. 'Even that is optimistic.'</p>

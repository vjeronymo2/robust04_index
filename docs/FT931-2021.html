			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Survey of Information and Communications Technology (1): New era of global networks - The increasing convergence of the computer and communication technologies is a powerful driver of globalisation, enabling companies to capture economies of scale by eliminating barriers of time and space THE UNION of computers and communications is a marriage made in heaven. Yet while the banns have been read many times over the past two decades, consummation has been a slow process. The reasons are both cultural and technical, but today there is renewed optimism that a new era in information processing systems is about to unfold as a result of the convergence of the two most powerful modern technologies. Computers and digital (computer language) communications lie at the heart of information technology; computers realise their full potential only when connected in networks; telecommunications systems based on digital technology are infinitely more flexible and powerful than their analogue cousins. Together, they are a powerful driver of globalisation, enabling companies to capture economies of scale by eliminating barriers of time and space. The telecom and computer industries, however, have separate origins and history. Telecoms stretches back into the last century; the industry grew up with traditions of regulation, monopoly power and a duty to maintain and protect the network. The computer industry grew out of research into scientific calculation and, in the 1950s, it was grafted onto the mature office equipment business which it then proceeded to cannibalise. Telecom companies and computer companies have often been seen as competitors rather than allies. In the 1980s, AT&amp;T, the US telecommunications giant, and International Business Machines, the world's largest computer manufacturer, seemed set for a battle royal as AT&amp;T established a computer division and IBM bought Rolm, a promising telecoms manufacturer. In the end, it proved to be a phoney war. AT&amp;T bought NCR two years ago to rationalise its loss-making computer business; IBM sold Rolm to Siemens of Germany in 1989. According to Mr Alan Willsher, managing director of GPT Communications Systems, owned jointly by GEC of the UK and Siemens of Germany, the moves were premature: 'They came in too early before digital public-switched networks had been properly established. Ten years on, most developed countries have a good digital system'. Among other developments which are creating optimism that the rate of convergence of computers and communications is speeding up include: Pressure on national telecommunications authorities to deregulate and liberalise their services. The US is the world's most deregulated telecommunications market; the UK leads in Europe. The European Commission seems set to put pressure on the remaining European nations to speed up the process, buoyed by a European Court of Justice decision that the commission has the right to compel member-states to deregulate certain telecom services. LIBERALISATION is seen by many as the key to the new era of information technology. According to Mr William Marx, writing in a colloquium report* to be published later this year: 'The liberalisation of trade and of regulation and the formulation of policies that bolster market-based economies will hasten the expansion and modernisation of global networks and at the same time deliver to individuals, companies and government, the full benefits of information technology.' Growth of distributed data processing, more commonly described now as client-server computing. This is a direct consequence of the increasing power of microprocessor chips and the declining cost of computing. For many applications today it makes economic sense to distribute processing through a network of personal computers, or clients, with more powerful systems - servers - providing network management and control, database services and a reservoir of computing power. A consequence has been a decline in the use of traditional mainframe computers with deleterious effects on the profit and loss accounts of mainframe vendors such as IBM and Groupe Bull. Client-server designs are not for everybody, however. A survey carried out among delegates to City IT, a conference held in London, showed worries about the difficulty of building and managing networks, fears of losing control of data and data security and concern for the technical inadequacies of personal computers - 'it is back to the dark ages,' one delegate said 'All the things mainframe people have known for the past 20 years, PCs do not have.' A market for mobile, radio-based telecommunications growing explosively. Building on the success of the earlier, analogue cellular telephones, suppliers are preparing to launch digital voice and data services. The pan-European Groupe Speciale Mobile will provide the digital infrastructure for a personal communications network. The use of digital technology in these networks will make possible new and sophisticated services while making better use of the available frequency spectrum. A further factor is the growth of distributed multimedia systems - the convergence of sound, data, static image and video. Many believe that multimedia will emerge as the dominant mass technology of the next century. The pace of change is being driven by the evolution of optical storage, which is making possible the capture of huge volumes of information on a disc only a few centimetres wide. A single disc, for example, can hold all the text and graphics from a 21 volume encyclopaedia set. However, as Mr David Hutchison of Lancaster University in the UK pointed out recently,** the telecoms authorities control the spread and adoption of multimedia applications - 'high telecommunications prices will hinder applications rollout. This is because multimedia traffic will require high bandwidths (transmission capacity): a single digital video stream offering full colour and motion may require two million bits per second even when compressed, using the most advanced techniques.' The growth of digital networks is changing the balance of power within the sector. Telecom companies, in particular, are showing a renewed interest in computer firms. This time round, however, their interest is in services companies. Nynex, for example, one of the US 'Baby Bells' bought the UK computing services company BIS, while AT&amp;T bought Istel, the former data processing unit of the Rover car group. France Telecom has invested in the Anglo-French Sema Group, while there are tenacious rumours that BT of the UK has an interest in acquiring a stake in EDS, the large General Motors subsidiary. This is a reflection of the fact that computer hardware has become essentially a commodity, yielding a low gross profit margin of perhaps less than 20 per cent. Computing services offer faster growth and a more reasonable margin and are a better fit with the nature of the telecoms business with its emphasis on service and customer satisfaction. One of the more exciting developments in the past two years has been the emergence of 'personal communicators,' hand-held devices which combine the functions of telephone handset with computer and facsimile machine. AT&amp;T is at the forefront of one such development working with the Californian company EO; the Japanese organisations Matsushita and Marubeni; and Olivetti, the Italian computer company. According to Mr Elserino Piol, Olivetti vice-chairman, a leading IT company these days has no choice but to enter the market for personal communicators. Other companies developing personal communicators or 'personal digital assistants' include IBM, Apple and, in the UK, Amstrad. The importance of personal communicators and their desk-bound equivalents is the emergence of the 'broadband' society where individuals have access to virtually unlimited amounts of information. Mr Marx* sketches the likely future: 'Universal access to information and the relatively inexpensive cost of transmitting it, offer the potential to create a worldwide entrepreneurial revolution to rival the one that followed the personal computer.' * Globalization, Technology and Competition; Bradley et al eds; Harvard Business School Press. ** The Computer Journal, Volume 36, No. 1, Oxford University Press.</p>

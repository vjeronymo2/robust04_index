			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets: Stora and MoDo Stora and MoDo, two of Sweden's leading forestry groups, fell heavily yesterday on plans for big investments in new capacity, writes Christopher Brown-Humes in Stockholm. MoDo, which is considering a SKr2.1bn investment in a 270,000 tonnes per year newsprint machine at Braviken, saw its 'B' shares weaken SKr16 to SKr325. Stora fell SKr9 to SKr417 as it began design work on a new 290,000 tonnes per year board machine. This investment would cost around SKr2.8bn. These are the two biggest investment projects to emerge from the Swedish pulp and paper industry this year. The market took fright because the severe downturn in the pulp and paper cycle in 1991 and 1992 was caused by overcapacity, not by a drop in demand. There are fears that the current upturn could also be wrecked if too many companies order new equipment. The market is also worried about dividend prospects and - in MoDo's case - about a possible rights issue. The forestry index fell 1.73 per cent to 1,424.54, against an overall 0.2 per cent decline in the Stockholm bourse.</p>

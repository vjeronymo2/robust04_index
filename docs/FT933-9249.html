			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / Karadzic warns of war if Nato air strikes go ahead BOSNIAN SERB leader Mr Radovan Karadzic warned yesterday that Nato air strikes against Serb targets could unleash an all-out war which would leave his Moslem rivals with no territory. 'If a single bomb strikes a Serbian position, there would be no more talks. We would have an all-out war and catastrophe,' he said. 'The attack would trigger a huge battle, and chaos. There would be tremendous suffering on all three sides.' 'I would probably lose control of the central (army) command,' he added in an apparent attempt to play on the fears of Britain, France and Canada whose United Nations troops on the ground could face retaliation by Serb forces. His comments came in an interview after international mediators Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg had postponed talks because Serb forces had not withdrawn from strategic Mount Igman, west of Sarajevo. But as Nato finalised its military preparations for possible air strikes, afterits meeting on Monday which approved the logistics for strikes, officials admitted that action was unlikely in the next couple of days. Before any strikes can start, the UN, Nato or a member of the alliance must make a specific appeal for action, which must then receive final authorisation from Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary general. US officials yesterday said they would be pushing for Mr Boutros Ghali to approve action quickly, amid suspicions that its European allies still lacked the political will to press ahead with the strikes. But speaking at his lakeside hotel in Geneva, Mr Karadzic denounced as 'absolutely irresponsible' western threats to launch air strikes. He said it encouraged Bosnia's President Alija Izetbegovic to hold out for military intervention and derail talks on the republic's ethnic partition. Mr Izetbegovic has refused to return to the negotiating table with Serb and Croat adversaries until Serb forces complete their withdrawal from strategic heights above Sarajevo. He appears to be waiting to see whether Nato will now push ahead with the air strikes. He yesterday criticised Lord Owen for his cautious response to Nato's threat. 'I am not satisfied with Owen's statement on air strikes. In this way they (the mediators) are supporting the other side. This is counter productive,' he said. An angry Mr Karadzic warned: 'If Izetbegovic continues to sabotage the talks, he will lose everything.' It was unclear if Mr Karadzic had followed up a request from Lord Owen yesterday morning to order Bosnian Serb commander General Ratko Mladic to speed up the withdrawal of troops from a key area overlooking the besieged Sarajevo. Earlier in the day two delegations from the UN peacekeeping forces in Sarajevo visited the mountain to assess the Serb withdrawal. But UN commander Barry Frewer in Sarajevo said the Serb army had not yet complied with its pledge to pull back from Mount Igman, which is crucial to the mainly Moslem Bosnian army because of a military supply route.</p>

			<p><P> January 26, 1989, Thursday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> WALSH REPORTEDLY QUITS AS COACH OF 49ERS  </P> <P> Bill Walsh will give up the head coaching job of the Super Bowl champion San  Francisco 49ers, published reports today said, and there were strong  indications that he will be replaced by defensive coordinator George Seifert.  </P> <P> Walsh, who reportedly will take another job in the organization, has supported  Seifert as his replacement and Seifert reportedly cut short a trip to Cleveland  to discuss the Browns coaching job and returned to San Francisco on Wednesday.  </P> <P> A source told The Associated Press today that Cleveland was now leaning toward  hiring New York Jets defensive coordinator Bud Carson. Browns owner Art Modell  said he would meet with Carson tonight.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the New York Daily News reported today that sources close to the  situation said San Francisco owner Eddie DeBartolo Jr. wanted a high-profile  coach like Jimmy Johnson of the University of Miami.  </P> <P> Walsh, DeBartolo and their attorneys met Wednesday for two hours in the villa  DeBartolo is occupying this week while playing in the Pebble Beach Pro-Am golf  tournament, the San Francisco Examiner said today.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Comment  </P> <P> Neither Walsh, DeBartolo nor Johnson, reportedly out of his office Wednesday on  a recruiting trip, was available for comment. DeBartolo had said Tuesday that  it may be three weeks before a final determination is made on Walsh's status.  </P> <P> However, Miami Sports Information Director Rich Dalrymple, who said he spoke  with Johnson today, quoted the coach as saying: "It's just a rumor. I have had  no contact with the San Francisco 49ers."  </P> <P> The San Jose Mercury News, citing a source close to the 49ers, reported today  that Walsh has told his assistants that he will not return for an 11th season,  but will remain with the team in the front office.  </P> <P> The Examiner quoted 49ers Vice President and General Counsel Carmen Policy as  saying a meeting of team officials would be held today -- after DeBartolo  finishes his golf commitment.  </P> <P> Asked whether Walsh definitely is leaving as coach and whether Seifert would be  elevated to replace him, Policy on Wednesday night responded: "I can't say, but  all parties are on the same page."  </P> <P> Seifert, a leading candidate for the Cleveland Browns' vacant head coach  position, was en route to Cleveland on Wednesday and booked a room in a hotel  there. But after arriving in Dallas to change planes, he canceled the second  leg of his trip and booked a return flight to San Francisco.  </P></p>

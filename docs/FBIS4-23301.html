			<p>BFN     [Text] Bamako, 2 Jun (AFP) -- Four people were killed and  17 others wounded yesterday in a Tuareg-led attack on the Malian  locality of Fafa, near the Niger border, the MALIAN NEWS AGENCY  reported today. A Tuareg military leader, "Captain" Abokar  Sadek of the Islamic Arab Front of the Azaouad [FIAA], was  killed in the attack that followed a clash with the Malian Army,  the agency stated.    These incidents follow the signing of an agreement on 16 May  between the Malian Government and the Unified Movements and  Fronts of Azaouad [MFUA] which groups four major Tuareg  movements, including the FIAA. The agreement provides for the  integration of the MFUA combatants into the Malian Army and the  dismantling of their bases in northern Mali.</p>

			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / Russian jobless could reach 5m by end of 1993 RUSSIAN unemployment will probably reach 1m by the summer and could rise to 5m by the end of 1993, Mr Oleg Slavutsky, head of the country's federal employment service, said yesterday, Reuter reports from Moscow. He said the number of Russians out of work was 730,000 on April 1, up from 577,000 at the end of 1992. But he added that the data masked about 1.5m of what he called the 'hidden unemployed', including people on short-time work or those being forced to take unpaid leave. Another 2m or 3m people were unable or unwilling to look for work, he said. He estimated Russia's total workforce to be around about 70m. 'The new law on bankruptcy means that the rise in unemployment will accelerate in the coming months. By the end of the year we will probably see five million unemployed.' Russia launched its economic reform plan at the start of 1992, freeing most state-controlled prices and promising to sell off state-owned companies. But even the most unproductive companies have been kept going through loans and subsidies and unemployment has risen more slowly than originally expected.</p>

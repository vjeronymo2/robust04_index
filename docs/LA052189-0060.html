			<p><P> May 21, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WALL STREET / JOHN CRUDELE: TAKEOVER CANDIDATES ARE TODAY'S BLUE-PLATE SPECIALS  </P> <P> Once a month a group of about 15 stockbrokers from different investment firms  in Chicago get together for lunch at the Brokers Inn on South LaSalle St.,  across from the Chicago Board of Trade, to exchange ideas.  </P> <P> But these days the brokers aren't discussing which companies will have  blockbuster new products, or which industries are about to have an earnings  revival, or even where they think the stock market is going. Instead, they sit  around for about 90 minutes trying to pick the next corporate takeover  candidate.  </P> <P> "We bounce stories off each other," says Mike Rzepka, a broker at Prescott,  Ball &amp; Turben Inc. "Lately it's mostly hot stories."  </P> <P> "Hot" in Wall Street's lingo means stories about corporate takeovers,  restructurings and the like. "It's one of the only ways to make money in this  market," adds Rzepka.  </P> <P> Stock prices overall have been up this year; in fact, up sharply. Even so, most  of the professionals who work with the stock market seem unusually insecure  about their good fortune. Now even brokers, usually among the more conservative  of the Wall Street bunch and the closest link to the public, seem to have  become far more aggressive, handling stocks as speculators and traders do. And  they've been bitten by the takeover bug, hoping to make the money and run.  </P> <P> Alfred Goldman, head of technical market analysis for A. G. Edwards in St.  Louis, says interest in takeover stocks is "definitely up" over the past few  months, especially among those clients he calls "stockaholics."  </P> <P> "There has been a definite increase among individual investors in playing each  day's stock du jour," says Goldman, whose job it is to spot unusual trading  patterns in a stock that could be a forerunner to a takeover and relay the  information to his brokers.  </P> <P> It's difficult to say whether the Chicago lunchers are an anomaly or the  beginning of the next trend. Experts say the get-together such as the one at  the Brokers Inn takes place in all major cities, and more frequently the latest  in corporate takeovers and rumors is the conversation.  </P> <P> There has, of course, always been a hard-core group of brokers (and investors,  for that matter) who've been willing to put their money into risky takeover  situations. But only recently does it seem that the allure of quick and big  profits from the takeovers of companies such as NWA Corp and RJR Nabisco has  started to grab the attention of a wider group of brokers. And these brokers  are hooking clients on their ideas.  </P> <P> The Chicago luncheon meetings were begun six months ago and are the clearest  indication of how far some brokers have come since the crash. This type of  get-together is not only unusual because of the topic discussed, but because  brokers have no qualms about sharing ideas freely with their peers (and  competitors) at other firms.  </P> <P> In a sense, the same pressure that brought brokers to deal in speculative  stocks seems to have created a camaraderie among brokers that transcends  company lines.  </P> <P> There were about 100,000 stockbrokers before the 1987 crash. Of those, the  Securities Industries Assn. estimates that 8% to 10% have lost their jobs.  Those who have hung on have seen their compensation decline sharply over the  past two years. One estimate is that brokers, on average, now earn only about  80% of what they did before the crash.  </P> <P> Brokers have resorted to hawking fixed-rate investments such as certificates of  deposit and exotic investments with high commissions to clients who still want  no part of stocks.  </P> <P> Newer brokers without an established client list have been doing even worse,  with some probably wishing they were a Maytag repairman so they'd get a little  more action.  </P> <P> "If it weren't for (trading in takeovers)," said another broker in the Chicago  group, "my business would be down 60% instead of 40%."  </P> <P> "My clients like that kind of action," he added. "It's where the money is being  made."  </P> <P> James Pascoe, a broker in the Darien, Conn., office of Janney Montgomery Scott,  doesn't play speculative stocks but he does get involved in takeover deals that  have been announced but not completed. That is arbitrage in its truest form.  And Pascoe says a lot of brokers he knows are doing the same.  </P> <P> "If you can make 7% or 8% in a couple of months, it's a lot better than having  money in the bank or in the market," says Pascoe, who says he's still nervous  about the general market.  </P> <P> Small investors are also apparently still nervous from the crash, but there may  be signs of hope for brokers. Stock prices have blossomed in May, thanks mainly  to encouraging news on inflation. And even though the return of the small  investor to the stock market has been incorrectly predicted numerous times  before, this time, experts say, it really could occur.  </P> <P> Jeffrey Schaefer, senior vice president of the securities association, says  that as late as last March 30 there was evidence of only a "very slight" growth  in interest in stocks by small investors. "Only now are they getting more  aggressive," says Schaefer.  </P> <P> William Coppel, vice president of marketing at the discount brokerage firm of  Quick &amp; Reilly, also thinks that the May rally has caught the attention of  small investors. But, he says, "it's not dramatic."  </P> <P> If the stock market does continue to rise and if small investors are lured back  into the market, then maybe those folks at the Brokers Inn can worry about the  soup du jour, rather than the rumor du jour.  </P> <P> How did the financial market handle last week's attack of the killer economic  figures? At first glance, not too badly. Inflation on the producer level rose  just 0.4% in April, which wasn't nearly as bad as expected. And inflation on  the consumer level, which rose 0.7%, wasn't any worse than Wall Street  expected. And for good measure, the nation's trade deficit shrank $1 billion in  March to $8.8 billion.  </P> <P> But the numbers weren't really anything to cheer about, either. The trade  deficit fell because America's exports rose sharply, which means that the  nation's economy may not be slowing as much as experts had hoped. This means  that the pros could soon start worrying about inflation and higher interest  rates all over again.  </P> <P> And inflation on the consumer level is up 5.1% from April, 1988, to April,  1989. "Year-over-year inflation numbers look pretty bad," says Edward Yardeni,  chief economist at Prudential-Bache Securities.  </P> <P> What will happen to interest rates in the months ahead? Experts say the key is  the dollar. The only way to get the greenback down -- as the United States  seems to want -- may be to lower interest rates in America and raise them  overseas.  </P> <P> Can a new line of copiers and some new printers save Xerox Corp.'s  independence?  </P> <P> B. Alex Henderson, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities, believes that  these new products, together with a cost-cutting effort begun by the company  last year, may be all that stands between the company and an unwanted takeover  attempt. If Xerox mishandles these products and doesn't improve its earnings,  there could be trouble, says Henderson.  </P> <P> "If they manage to bungle this, the probability that someone goes after them is  high," says Henderson.  </P> <P> Wall Street speculators, of course, always jump the gun. So for the past couple  of weeks there have been rumors of an imminent bid for Xerox. The Stamford,  Conn.-based technology company's stock has moved predictably higher, although  its rise moderated when Hanson Trust -- one of the rumored suitors -- said in  no uncertain terms that it wasn't planning any big acquisition at this time.  </P> <P> Still, the speculators aren't disheartened. They think that Xerox, with its  numerous product lines, its servicing capabilities and its financial services  subsidiary, can be easily dismembered by some enterprising raider.  </P> <P> Prudential-Bache's Henderson, meanwhile, thinks that Xerox's stock -- which was  trading in the mid-$60s last week -- could reach $73 in six months and $82 in  12 to 18 months. And that's without any of the takeover premonitions coming  true. In a takeover, Xerox could be worth $100 to $125 a share, Henderson  estimates.  </P> <P> Wall Street may be getting more and more optimistic about a so-called "soft  landing" for the United States economy, but economists are even more convinced  that the landing will be hard -- with a recession in 1989.  </P> <P> Blue Chip Economic Indicators, which surveys the nation's top economists, says  21% of the experts it surveyed in May think that a recession will occur this  year, and another 47% think that it will begin in 1990. That's a total of 68%  who think that there will be a recession either this year or next.  </P> <P> In Blue Chip's January poll, 65% of the economists surveyed felt that there  would be a recession this year or next, although the distribution was a bit  different. Then, 35% of the economists thought that the recession would come in  1989 and 30% thought that it would start in 1990.  </P> <P> Occidental Petroleum's stock rose last Tuesday on a rumor that the company  would announce a restructuring at this week's shareholder meeting. There was  also a recurring rumor that Occidental's 87-year-old chairman Armand Hammer was  ill. An Occidental Petroleum spokesman said there would be no major  announcement this coming week, and he said Hammer was fine but volunteered to  "stay in bed for a couple of days" if it'll help the stock price . . .  </P> <P> An analyst at Wertheim Schroder &amp; Co. got people who are speculating in  Time Inc. stock very excited last week when he told a little-known news service  subscribed to by most Wall Street traders that a recent lawsuit against Time by  Viacom could endanger "a leveraged buyout of Time (that was) recently proposed  by a major investment banking house." "Woo!" said the speculators who read the  remarks. "We didn't know anyone had proposed a leveraged buyout." Londoner  didn't return telephone calls. But a Wall Street source says there is no such  offer and that the analyst now has "egg on his face" . . .  </P> <P> CNW has cleverly suggested that the Interstate Commerce Commission review all  transactions involving railroads, whether with public or private parties. CNW,  of course, is a railroad, and Japonica Partners, a private company, is trying  to acquire it. A review of the transaction by the ICC could slow things down  quite a bit -- maybe for years . . .  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 21, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: PASADENA;  </P> <P> PROJECT EXEMPT FROM BOND  </P> <P> The Board of Directors on Tuesday told One Colorado developer Douglas Stitzel  that he does not need to put up a "completion bond" on the $70-million retail  project in Old Pasadena.  </P> <P> Stitzel had asked the board to exempt him from the requirement.  </P> <P> His attorney, William Cathey, told the board that the general contractor, C. L.  Peck/Jones Brothers Construction Corp., already requires that all its  subcontractors be bonded.  </P> <P> City Directors John Crowley and Rick Cole reminded Cathey that the requirement  was made in order to guarantee that once work began on the project it would be  completed.  </P> <P> But Cathey said Stitzel has every intention of completing the job, and will  secure construction financing within the next two weeks to cover the cost of  building the project.  </P></p>

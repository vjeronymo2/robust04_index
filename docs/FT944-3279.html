			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / Arts: Figaro's Wedding - Opera Figaro's Wedding, as the English National Opera quite rightly calls it, is a better translation of Mozart's Le nozze di Figaro than the stilted 'Marriage of Figaro'. Since Saturday, Graham Vick's 1991 production is enjoying its second ENO revival, as rehearsed by John Abulafia with a largely new cast. For newcomers to the opera, it would make a fine pre-Christmas treat. For seasoned Mozartians it offers nothing special beyond a promising team of principals who need a little more time to work themselves in, but it is creditable and funny enough in Jeremy Sams' indefatigably bright version ('translation' would be the wrong word). The new conductor is the Canadian Derrick Inouye, who showed a lively grasp of the main lines of the score and how to pace them. The lyrical interplay between soloists and first-desk woodwinds  - a touchstone for any Figaro of distinction  - was less confident on this first night; and in the breathless Cherubino-Susanna duettino (as he prepares to leap from the window) orchestra and singers came hopelessly adrift. The soprano Nerys Jones is Cherubino, prettily sung but slightly relentless in 'his' two set pieces; Susanna is Rosemary Joshua, fresh, alert and charming despite too many genteelly indeterminate words. For diction as well as bursts of solid character, Susan Bickley's Marcellina outdoes them both, and in every ensemble her line is a sterling pleasure to hear. John Connell's peppery Don Bartolo is another solid asset, uncommonly vital and varied. Rosa Mannion is an elegantly unhappy Countess who seems to have dropped in from a higher sphere, where the oxygen is thinner. Neither she nor anybody else is particularly accommodated in this production. They go through the basic moves energetically, but none of those were  - as balletomanes say  - 'made' on them, and the general effect is, well, generalised. The sole survivor from the original cast is John Graham-Hall's excellent Don Basilio, whose extravagant foppishness now looks quite mad among these un-classy people. The leading men exemplify the problem. Figaro is the bass-ish baritone Steven Page, whose long-jawed, baleful presence makes him a natural Count (his previous role in the opera) no less than the operatic-villain tics that stud his vocal delivery. The original Figaro here (Bryn Terfel) must have been very different, but nothing is made of Page's own peculiar strengths. Again, Robert Poulton's Count  - who sports a good line in self-satisfied gloating, and compensates for underweight tone by forceful attack  - is left to cut a merely foolish figure: why should his Countess care about retrieving him? Undoubtedly Vick's production was devised according to the virtues of the first cast. The current staging is short on the psychological detail which should lend depth to what is sung  - and that must originally have been crucial, for Richard Hudson's sets are too anorexically minimal to establish anything. Great slabs of plain, bright colours, lined-in just enough to fix them as walls, ceilings and floors; no furniture beyond what the action expressly requires, nor any extra doors or windows. The Almavivas seem to live in near-destitution. In the bedroom of the Countess there is nothing at all for Susanna to hide behind, so we have to assume that the Count is obstinately failing to notice her. In the final garden-act, brightly lit, the actors have to mime blind stumbling-in-the-dark. Between such collusive artifices and Mozart's uncomplicated naturalism, Figaro's Wedding looks fractured. As 'poor theatre', it could fit an intimate stage perfectly; in its present form in the vast Coliseum space, it seems wilfully denuded of its cosy, hierarchical domestic setting, without  - so far - enough telling character-detail to make good the loss. Goodish, nonetheless; but no kind of 'must'. Further performances December 15 and 17; the run continues in January and February</p>

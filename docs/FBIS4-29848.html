			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Reporter Yi Sang-ki] </F>   [Text] As North Korea's nuclear issue has been entering a  stage of tension, people's anxiety about a war has been  increasing. Indeed, how much possibility is there for a war to  break out on the Korean peninsula?    Generally speaking, it may be senseless to try to reach a  "clear-cut" conclusion about the possibility of a war breaking  out. Perhaps this is why the authorities concerned at the  Ministry of National Defense [MND] have come up with the  following projection on North Korea's recent military movements:  "Whereas there is very little likelihood of a total war  breaking out," the authorities stress, "the possibility always  exists that some limited accidental warfare might be provoked."    Based on the following data, the MND argues that there is  little likelihood that a total war might break out: First of  all, although it has supremacy in terms of the number of troops  and the amount of weapons, North Korean armed forces are  ill-prepared to carry out total warfare due to the lack of  practical exercises on the part of the Navy and Air Force and  due to the limited logistical stockpile of military supplies and  ammunition. In particular, what is also important is that North  Korea's self-supply rate for oil and food-- which are essential  in a war--is 40 percent and 60 percent respectively.    Second, the ROK armed forces and U.S. Forces in Korea have a  considerable level of combined combat capability of handling the  initial stages of North Korea's surprise attack.    Third, the MND has judged that while the United States is  firm in its intention to punish North Korea, those  countries--including China and Russia--which in the past  supported North Korea, have already stopped providing it with  military aid, and even if they should continue to do so, would  be very passive in providing future aid.    The MND stated: There is very little likelihood that `a  second Korean war' will break out due to a combination of North  Korea's military status, the capability of the ROK and the  United States to cope with a contingency, and the positions of  neighboring countries.    According to the MND, there are now only about 10 out of  some  260 signs which indicate a possibility that a war might break  out on the Korean Peninsula. Therefore, the present tense  situation does not warrant being worried.    But, the MND added: The possibility remains of a limited  military conflict caused by an accidental provocation which the  unpredictable North Korean regime might commit with a view to  finding a breakthrough in the process of solving the nuclear  crisis.    The MND feels, in particular, that we cannot entirely rule  out the possibility of a limited military conflict escalating  into large-scale warfare. According to the MND, as far as the  international community's sanctions against North Korea  regarding its nuclear issue are concerned, we are actually  worried that North Korea might try to blockade the five islands,  including Paeknyong Island, in the West Sea, or bombard the ROK  Forces stationed near the ceasefire line.    Accordingly, the MND has regarded the remarks--which the  North Korean authorities have recently made--not as the  expression of their will to provoke a war, but as aimed at  staging psychological warfare attempted at creating among South  Koreans, a fear of war and an atmosphere for opposing hard-line  sanctions against the North. In recent months, North Korean  authorities have made tough-line remarks such as: "We will  regard UN economic sanctions as a declaration of war,"; or  "sanctions are a war, a war is merciless"; or "when a war breaks  out, South Korea will be devastated by smashing attacks."    Some officials have also pointed out that a war on the  Korean  Peninsula is likely to break out with a preemptive strike  against North Korea by the U.S. rather than by North Korea's  reckless provocations. The so-called preventive war theory has  been regarded as one of U.S. Government's options since U.S.  Secretary of Defense William Perry made the following remarks in  April: "If North Korea should continue nuclear development, we  are ready to conduct a bombing raid on its nuclear facilities."    In dealing with North Korea's nuclear issue, the United  States's position is to maintain control over nuclear  development even if it entails having to go to war, while the  ROK is of the opinion that a war on the Korean Peninsula should  be prevented by any means. This is an important difference  between the two countries. We also cannot rule out the  possibility of a conflict in the national interests of friendly  nations at a decisive moment.</p>

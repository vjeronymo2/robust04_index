With other  seizures made recently, this brings the figure for the week to  10 tons. The total worth of these drugs is approximately 250  million new pesos.    On this occasion, the Federal Judicial Police agents  captured  10 presumed drug dealers who were about to move the drugs to the  United States. Of the five vehicles seized from them, four were  escorting a trailer truck carrying the marijuana under a  shipment of fertilizer.    The PGR's branch office in that state reported that, after a  series of investigations, it was learned that a group of drug  traffickers intended to make the move in the vicinity of the  highway leading from Monterrey to Reynosa, Tamaulipas.    Arrested on that highway, near the La Tortola ranch, were  Fernando Ruiz Salgado, Gumaro Garza de la Garza, Juan Ariel  Lopez Moreno, and Jorge Antonio Gomez Garza. They were riding in  a Grand Marquis vehicle without license plates, forming the  surveillance convoy for the large marijuana shipment.    Also arrested were Jaime Ortiz Garcia, Edgar Moreno Silva,  and Maximo Avila Murillo, riding in a Cutlass sedan, and Edmundo  Canales Rodriguez, all of whom were engaged in surveillance. Two  Nissan compact cars were seized as well.    The last one to be arrested, Jaime Ramirez Gonzalez, was  driving the red tractor trailer truck with treads. Realizing  that he had been detected, he attempted to escape with the  truck; however, after a chase along the highway, he was forced  to stop. When the vehicle was searched, hundreds of packages  wrapped in self-stick plastic, with a gross weight of three tons  and 876 kg, were discovered.    The Federal Public Prosecutor's Office indicated that,  within  the next few hours, the decision would be made for the remand of  these individuals to the pertinent district court, based on  their presumed guilt of committing various crimes against  health. An investigation is also being made to determine the  possible participation of Jose Luis Antu Martinez, who attempted  to obstruct the federal agents' work. [passage omitted]</p>

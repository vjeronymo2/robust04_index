			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / MPs petitioned on artillery ranges Farmers and villagers in Otterburn, Northumberland are to petition the Commons for the removal of the Ministry of Defence's Otterburn Training Area from designation as part of the Northumberland National Park. The petitioners, who estimate the army's presence is worth Pounds 6m a year to the local economy, are worried that recent criticism by environmentalists of the presence of military training in the national park could jeopardise the future of the artillery ranges, which date from 1911.</p>

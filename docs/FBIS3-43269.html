The year 1993 is coming to an end in a few hours. As  we celebrate this occasion, it is important that we reflect on  some of the achievements and setbacks which we had during the  year that has just ended. To begin with, you will recall that  towards the end of 1992 I called for a national referendum on  the system of national politics in this country. The results of  the referendum, which was held on June 14th this year, were in  favor of the introduction of a multiparty system of government.  I readily accepted these results and urged the government to  take the necessary legislative measures to ensure that the  people's choice was respected and granted.    Bwanas and Donas, I am most pleased and happy that  thereafter, the government moved swiftly to enact the necessary  legislation for the integration of political pluralism in this  country. Section 12 of the constitution was amended within two  weeks of the referendum in order to turn the country into a  multiparty state. Parliament also passed an act to provide for  the registration of political parties in the country. Following  these legislative measures, the country now has seven registered  political parties, including the ruling Malawi Congress Party,  MCP.    You will recall that on 23rd June 1993 I declared a general  amnesty for all Malawian exiles irrespective of the political  offences they had committed during the period when the country  was a one-party state. The general amnesty was granted in order  to enable such Malawians to return and participate freely in the  new political process after the referendum. Parliament enacted  the relevant general amnesty bill within two weeks of the  referendum.    Since that time, almost all political exiles have returned  home as free citizens and similarly, there are no political  prisoners being held in our prisons now.    Bwanas and Donas, you will also recall that I established  the  presidential committee on dialogue last year to discuss and  consult with the public affairs committee on issues of national  interest. It is pleasing to me to note that the two committees  [are] facilitating dialogue on many important issues and have  made much progress. They reached agreement on the management of  the transition process to political pluralism in the country.  In August 1993, these two committees, representing government  and the opposition, agreed to establish the National  Consultative Council [NCC] and the National Executive Committee  [NEC] to oversee the transition process. The National  Consultative Council has already agreed on and drawn up a  timetable of events leading to the holding of multiparty general  elections on 17 May 1994.    Bwanas and Donas, the intensity of and the progress from the  dialogue that has taken place in the NCC concerning the  transition process, has demonstrated the good faith that exists  between the opposition political parties and the government in  the work for the country's future. As a result of that  dialogue, the government has adopted a number of legislative  measures aimed at ensuring free and fair general elections in  May 1994. I would therefore like to commend the NCC and the NEC  for the successful management of the transition process. I urge  them to continue to cooperate and negotiate in good faith to  resolve the remaining issues they have to handle. They must  approach all these problems with the highest sense of  responsibility and maturity because the competition will get  more intense as we approach the election day.    As part of the transition process, I have recently appointed  members of the electoral committee on the recomendation of the  NCC. I have noted with pleasure that the electoral commission  has now started its work.    Bwanas and Donas, you must remember that the main aim of  political parties during the campaign process is to win more  voters for the elections. This is mostly done by presenting the  contents of the respective party's manifesto to the electorate  in order to enable the electorate to make informed choices. I  wish to appeal to the leaders and political parties to discuss  their political differences with tolerance and to maintain peace  and calm, law and order and racial harmony in the country during  and even after the transition period. In making this appeal, I  am confident that the same political wisdom which has enabled us  to avoid ethnic violence and tribal hostilities over the past 31  years will guide our political conduct all the way, that is  before, during and well after the general elections. It is the  moral duty for all of us to do our best to spare this country  the political strife and social chaos which result in tragic  loss of human life and property.    The government has now disarmed the military wing of the  young pioneers movement through the Malawi Army and police. At  its next sitting, parliament will repeal the relevant section of  the Malawi Pioneer Act. Once again, as I said on (?2d)  December, I regret the unfortunate loss of innocent life and  damage to property which occurred during the initial phase of  the disarmament exercise. It is my sincere hope that the people  of this country will not have to go through such social  tragedies again in the future. In this regard, you will recall  that I recently set up a fund to assist the army and civilian  victims of disarmament exercise. I, therefore, appeal to all  concerned Malawians to contribute generously in support of this  fund.    I understand that there were few members of the Malawi Youth  Pioneers [MYP] who fled from their homes [words indistinct] at  the beginning of the disarmament procedures which [as heard] may  still be in hiding. I have also received reports that some of  them may have crossed the border into Mozambique. If this is so,  it is most unfortunate, though understandable. These young men  are frightened and they were running for their lives. I would  like to appeal to any MYP members that may still be in hiding to  return home and report to the police and army officers who will  ensure their safety.    If any MYP members have indeed crossed into Mozambique while  fleeing for safety, I have confidence that our friends, the  Mozambican authorities, will understand this event in this  spirit. It is my hope that they will gather them from wherever  they are and return them to us formally. We are most anxious to  have them return home safely as precedents already exist for  such an exchange, because I do recall that during the days of  the Mozambican conflict, Mozambican soldiers who fled into  Malawi while running away from the hostilities in the Mozambican  conflict were always handed back formally to the authorities in  Mozambique.    (?Here) I am happy to tell you that a meeting of the joint  defense and security commission for Malawi and Mozambique is to  be convened. It will take place in Blantyre starting Wednesday  next week [5 January]. I have confidence that the issues will  be resolved amicably at that meeting.    Now, turning to the economy of the country, I was relieved  to  note that after experiencing a most severe drought in the  history of the country in 1991 [words indistinct]. It is  unfortunate that the prices of tobacco and other crops were not  satisfactory. This was due to [words indistinct]. As for this  year, I wish to thank those of you who have cleared your gardens  in good time in readiness for the rains. I, however, understand  that the rains have been sporadic in some parts of the country.  Let us all pray for good rains again this season so that we can  be self-sufficient in food and sustain our economy, which, as we  all know, is based on agriculture.    Lastly, I would like to thank very sincerely all the donors  who met in Paris for deciding to resume development aid to  Malawi. To quote from their own press release: I quote, "the  donors confirm resumption of economic and financial support to  Malawi in recognition of the exceptional progress made in  political transformation and of the economic policy measures and  (?steps taken) in the ongoing economic adjustment process."  Such credit or commendation from the donor community these days  is very significant. No one should belittle such an achievement  in this country because many communities elsewhere are being  condemned for political and economic mismanagement. All  Malawians should be proud of such recognition in world politics  today. In addition, the international community has spoken of  Malawi as a model for the management of the process of political  transition. In Paris, they praised all Malawians for our  efforts to carry out the transition process in a peaceful and  orderly manner.    I, therefore, appeal again to all Malawians to continue to  be  worthy of that praise. I agree with the donors that the process  of political reform in this country should remain on track. We  must cooperate with each other for the good of our nation  despite our political differences. We must avoid irrational or  emotional behavior. We must remain responsible by discussing  and sorting out our grievances for the good future of our  country. We must not jeopardize the successful dialogue which  we have established with our donors in Paris.    Bwanas and Donas of all races, I would like to thank you for  all the messages of encouragement and goodwill which I received  while I was ill in South Africa and since my return. Let us all  enter the year 1994 with a firm commitment to maintain peace and  [word indistinct] law and order. We must forgive one another  for any wrongdoing. We must encourage the spirit of  reconciliation and tolerance, and we must indeed contribute to a  stable and better Malawi, irrespective of our political  affiliation.    This is why I (?have decreed) that there should be a general  amnesty to cover everyone, including political offenders and  those who violated our security laws, both here at home and  abroad. We must remember and understand that certain actions  were taken to safeguard the security of the country.    Bwanas and Donas, I wish you all a very happy and prosperous  new year. May the Almighty God bless you all. Good night.</p>

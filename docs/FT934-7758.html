			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Ministers in agreement on EC fraud curbs EUROPEAN COMMUNITY farm ministers yesterday broadly agreed measures to reinforce controls on subsidised exports to prevent fraud, Belgian farm minister Andre Bourgeois said, reports Reuter from Brussels. 'Ministers achieved virtual unanimity. . . they just need to finalise the text,' added Mr Bourgeois, whose country is the current holder the EC presidency, after a meeting of the community's agriculture council. Under the plan officials would be given flexibility to concentrate inspections where the risk of fraud was greatest. They would be required to inspect 5 per cent of all subsidised exports, instead of 5 per cent in each product sector as at present. Customs officials at EC frontiers would also check a certain volume of exports cleared in the interior to safeguard against substitution of goods. 'It's a confidence building measure for member states and for the public,' the Belgian minister said. The ministers will discuss the issue again at the next agriculture council, which is scheduled to start on December 13.</p>

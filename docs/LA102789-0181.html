			<p><P> October 27, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> FUNDS FOR OVERSEAS BASES CUT  </P> <P> The Senate today approved an $8.5-billion military construction bill that  slashes President Bush's request for bases overseas but adds millions of  dollars for domestic projects.  </P> <P> By voice vote, the Senate adopted the legislation and sent it to Bush for his  signature.  </P> <P> The bill cuts military construction spending in fiscal 1990 by $461 million  from what was spent during the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30 and is $65  million below what Bush wanted to spend this year.  </P> <P> "I think we've seen the peak of military construction spending for many years  to come," said Sen. Jim Sasser (D-Tenn.), chairman of the Senate Appropriations  subcommittee on military construction. "Next year may be even smaller than the  bill here today."  </P></p>

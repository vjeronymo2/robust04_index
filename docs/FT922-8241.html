			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Lifting the lid on a Pandora's box: Major's commitment to more open government will be shown in reforms that are piecemeal but profound When the prime minister recently announced the identity of the head of MI6, Britain's secret intelligence service, the very existence of which had never been publicly acknowledged, he caused a considerable and deliberate stir. This was no casual indiscretion. Mr Major linked the outing of MI6's chief with a pledge to sweep away the 'cobwebs of secrecy which needlessly veiled too much government business'. This week, Mr William Waldegrave, the minister responsible for the civil service, announced a far-reaching review of the UK's secrecy laws. Legislation to lift unnecessary restrictions on the release of government information is expected next year. These steps are only the first in a programme of measures to open the whole Whitehall machine to greater scrutiny, as promised in the Conservative party election manifesto. However, greater openness is only part of a programme of constitutional reform which the prime minister is considering, including changes in the position of Scotland and perhaps even a Bill of Rights. Initially, it will be open government where greatest progress is made. First to go will be some of the secrecy which surrounds ministerial decision-making. The responsibilities and membership of cabinet committees which do most of the cabinet's work will be published for the first time, within the next few days. And Questions of Procedure for Ministers, the guidebook which sets out ministers' responsibilities, will be published. Mr Major remains opposed to any formal legislation on freedom of information. His view is that it only makes things more secret: civil servants and politicians will not commit to writing information which would be embarrassing were it to come out. And he believes that the quality of policy-making will deteriorate if advisers cannot explore all options freely because their advice is to be in the public domain. But the prime minister is keen to relax the procedures under which many government papers remain secret well beyond the traditional 30-year rule. He would like a blanket release of historic documents, including many still classified from the Second World War, with only those for which release could be proved damaging held back. Following opposition from the cabinet office over the resources this screening would involve, the likelihood is that more archive material will be made available on request, subject to veto case by case by the department concerned. The Conservatives can already claim some success at opening Whitehall to public gaze. For example, the more powerful select committees set up after the 1979 general election can question ministers and civil servants in public and call for the production of documents and other evidence. The creation of more than 70 executive agencies to deliver government services has led to the publication of information previously shrouded in secrecy on targets, quality of service and financial performance. And the Citizen's Charter, the prime minister's campaign to improve the public services, is forcing schools, health authorities and local councils to publish details of their performance. Increasing the openness of government is a move to expose deficiencies in the constitutional system, according to Mr Graham Mather. Mr Mather is president of the European Policy Forum, a free-market think-tank on constitutional reform which has attracted Mr Major's support. 'It will make the workings of the system clearer and allow informed debate on its shortcomings,' Mr Mather says. 'Mr Major is more interested in constitutional change than Mrs Thatcher, and is prepared to consider deft changes to political mechanisms which could produce better results.' Mr Major has already signalled an interest in changing parliamentary procedures and hours. And he has made encouraging noises about Scotland, where despite a modest increase in votes at the election, the legitimacy of Conservative rule is undermined by the party's third position in Scottish politics. While there is no doubting the prime minister's commitment to preserving the Union, he has gone out of his way to promise some change to 'make government more responsive to the needs of Scotland'. This may be no more than the formation of a select committee for Scotland, or the restoration of the Scottish Grand Committee - all MPs with Scottish seats - sitting perhaps in Edinburgh from time to time. But the prime minister has made it clear that he is prepared to look for new solutions to constitutional problems. Other issues he is likely to address include the constitutional role of local government. After a decade of strife between Whitehall and town halls and the growth of contracting out and opting out, local authorities are changing into purchasers of local services rather than providers. Many Conservatives believe that a review is overdue, and that the work of Sir John Banham's Local Government Commission offers an opportunity for a new settlement between central and local government. Mr Mather sees the 1990s as a decade of even more radical constitutional reform - including the introduction of a Bill of Rights which would entrench such constitutional changes. 'We have been moving into a more rights-based structure for the public services,' he says. 'It would be appropriate to mark such changes with a written document.' This commitment to a some sort of written guarantee of rights is echoed by Mr Ferdinand Mount, the former Downing Street adviser whose recent book The British Constitution Now sets out a Conservative agenda for reform. He proposes a constitutional entrenchment law, complete with supreme court to rule on it - and asserts that such a move would be entirely within the Conservative tradition. Mr Major has certainly given no hint of a move towards a Bill of Rights in his thinking. But both Mr Mather and Mr Mount are influential in Downing Street and among Conservative opinion-formers. The prime minister is clearly delighted to have seized the initiative on open government - he teased Conservatives at the Carlton Club's eve of Queen's Speech reception with allusions to the 'surprise' he planned for the next day. As an astute politician, he undoubtedly realises that moving to the ground of constitutional reform denies it to his opponents. However, he is also aware of the need to carry his party on any reforms. Conservatives are easily alarmed by threats to the established order - as Lord St John of Fawsley put it, the party needs to be reassured that the slate is not about to be wiped clean and a fresh start made. So constitutional changes are likely to be piecemeal. But their eventual impact could be profound, as with other aspects of the 'incremental Conservatism' which has become the hallmark of Majorism. They will certainly amount to more than a tilt in the direction of open government.</p>

			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Ramco Energy Ramco Energy, which supplies corrosion control and ancillary services to the petroleum and marine industries, reported pre-tax profits down from Pounds 297,000 to Pounds 81,000 for the six months to June 30. The outcome was struck on reduced turnover of Pounds 2.4m (Pounds 2.57m) and included a Pounds 117,000 loss (Pounds 143,000 profit) from an associated undertaking. Earnings came out at 0.33p (1.27p) per share. Mr Stephen Remp, chairman and chief executive, said the highlight of the year to date had been the signing in September of a contract for the development of oil fields in the Caspian Sea. The contract, between the State Oil Company of Azerbaijan and a consortium of 10 companies of which Ramco is a member, would, he said, unlock further opportunities in the former Soviet Union.</p>

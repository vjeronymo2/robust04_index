			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / EU to rule on media ownership The European Commission is expected to propose this month that the European Union draw up rules on concentrations of media ownership, a Commission official said yesterday. National laws aimed at ensuring that newspapers and television stations reflect diverse views differ widely, making it difficult for companies to operate across borders, said Mr Paul Waterschoot of the Commission's internal market division. European legislation would probably choose to limit media ownership depending on the size of the audience rather than on the number of publications or stations any one company owns. The Commission decided the EU should act following consultations with industry, national officials and others on a 'green paper' it issued in 1992, he said.</p>

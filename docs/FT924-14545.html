			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / Launch of New FT Indices: Harmony dissidents claim support from institutions REBEL SHAREHOLDERS at Harmony Leisure are requisitioning an extraordinary meeting to try to oust the directors of the loss-making restaurant and pub group, following a 70 per cent increase in pre-tax losses. Former hotelier Mr Andrew Martyr, the leader of the dissident group, said attempts to install a new management team had been boosted by pledges of support from institutional shareholders after the company announced losses this week of Pounds 3.68m for the year to March 29. 'The institutions have decided all is not well and they are now supporting us,' Mr Martyr said yesterday. An EGM is expected to be held immediately after Harmony's annual meeting next month. Calls for management changes have gathered pace with the dramatic slide in the share price, which has fallen from 79p to 6p since 1990. 'Shareholders have lost a considerable amount of money,' said Mr Martyr. Queens Moat, the hotel group which has a 14.5 per cent stake in Harmony, has expressed concern at the losses. Southend Property Holdings, with a 4 per cent interest, confirmed it had been asked to support the rebels. Both companies said they will wait to examine the final accounts, expected to be published next week. Mr Stanley Lever, managing director of Harmony, has vowed to fight any moves to remove the existing board.</p>

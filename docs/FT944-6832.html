			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Arts: Soprano shines in glowing, timeless Traviata There was no lack of advance publicity for the Royal Opera's new production of La traviata, though in the circumstances that was not surprising. Any opera-house appearance by Sir Georg Solti, now 82, is going to be an event, even more so with him conducting La traviata for the first time in his life. When he invited Richard Eyre, the artistic director of the National Theatre, to try his first venture into opera, the stage was set for a major operatic event. What the hype failed to do was get the right person in the spotlight. When Verdi wrote La traviata, the role of the conductor was only just being properly defined and producers were non-existent. The opera stands or falls depending on its lead soprano. In Venice, in 1853, it was a fiasco (Fanny Salvini-Donatelli was overweight and off-form). At Covent Garden, last Friday, the soprano shone and the whole evening glowed with her. Angela Gheorghiu is a rising star. The Royal Opera has nurtured her carefully over the past few years, starting her off with Zerlina in Don Giovanni, then moving her on to Puccini's Mimi, and its patience has been rewarded. Making her entrance as if she is stepping out of a Winterhalter canvas, she looks and sounds born to play Violetta. One dab of iced water out of the champagne bucket and she is running up and down the scales of 'Sempre libera' as if she has been singing the music all her life. Perhaps her Romanian predecessor, Ileana Cotrubas, hit the solar plexus harder (her joyous laughter in Violetta's final moments still sends shivers down the spine 20 years on), but even she had not mastered every detail like this. Gheorghiu barely sings a phrase that has not been refined with the vocal equivalent of a nail-file. Every dot and dash in Verdi's score, every tone colour, was there; and what a joy to hear so much quiet singing. That is where Solti has played his part. Decca is recording these performances live (word about Gheorghiu has spread quickly in the business), and it will get music-making as scrupulously prepared as in any studio recording. Solti was adamant about performing the opera without the usual cuts, so we get rarely-heard second verses, not just automatic repeats, but each time given with new meaning. One could sense the audience was really listening. For his part Richard Eyre has worked with Gheorghiu to build a believable character. This is basically a traditional production, which keeps its eye on the ball. Sound old principles like character development count for more than eye-catching quirks. The first meeting of Violetta and Alfredo is a typical example: he starts by sitting modestly on the other side of the drawing-room, then circles his prey before tentatively planting a kiss on her cheek in time to the duet's final chord. Like Gheorghiu, Frank Lopardo as Alfredo sings with exemplary attention to detail and sensitivity - their duets together are lovers' whispers, not grand opera bawling. But I do wonder what they would make of him in Milan, where Italianate top notes count for more than musicianship. Leo Nucci lacks the vocal elegance for Giorgio Germont (try the old 78s recorded by Battistini) but worked hard to phrase broadly under Solti's tutelage. There were useful cameos from Leah-Marian Jones as a spiky Flora and Gillian Knight as Annina. Are Bob Crowley's needlessly lavish designs the main drawback? Not so far as design quality is concerned per se. Swirling staircases and heavily-ornamented gold ceilings make handsome settings for the public scenes, although it was illogical to have the stage area so cramped for those when the private scenes are so spacious. Alfredo's country retreat is a veritable palace and Violetta dies in what looks like a white-shuttered aircraft hangar. The music and the drama demand the opposite. The problem is that the bulkiness of the sets makes the intervals as long as the acts in between. I suspect that audiences in the future may curse this production as they go into Act 3 at the time of night when they were hoping to be on the train home. For this run of performances, though, nobody is likely to mind. Forget the 23.10 from Waterloo. So long as Gheorghiu and Solti are making music, time stands still. Sponsored by Barings and the Jean Sainsbury Royal Opera House Fund. Performances (with some changes of cast) until December 19</p>

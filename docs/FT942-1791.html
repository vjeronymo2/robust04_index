			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / International Company News: Macquarie updates plans for float Macquarie Bank, the Sydney-based investment bank, expects to circulate flotation plans among shareholders in 'the early part of next year', allowing them to decide whether the bank should become a listed company. Macquarie is owned by more than 40 institutions, with Hill Samuel Bank of the UK holding the largest single stake, at 14.4 per cent. Management and staff also own a sizeable minority interest. The update on the flotation possibility was provided yesterday by Mr David Clarke, chairman, as he unveiled profits of ADollars 73.9m (USDollars 54.5m) after tax for the year ended March, up 24 per cent on the previous year. Operating revenue was ADollars 570.5m, up from ADollars 530.7m. Interest paid and accrued on deposits dipped to ADollars 231.9m from ADollars 249.7m, while operating expenses rose to ADollars 245.4m from ADollars 202.8m. This left operating profits before tax 19.2 per cent higher, at ADollars 93.2m. Mr Allan Moss, Macquarie's managing director, said that gains had come from all the main business groups, although the equities business had fared particularly well with brokerage income 'surging'. As a result, the break-down of Macquarie's earnings changed last year, with fee income accounting for about 40 per cent, and trading and lending margins, 30 per cent apiece. In the past, these three areas have accounted for about one-third each. Mr Moss added that the bank had a number of overseas expansionary moves in sight - including the opening of equity-related operations in Hong Kong and New York - and was 'discussing the possibility of branch status in the UK'. He added that Macquarie was optimistic about domestic economic prospects for the current year. Macquarie's shareholder funds at the year-end were ADollars 339.6m, up 17.6 per cent. Total capital, including subordinated debt, was ADollars 520.9m, and the capital adequacy ratio was 13.77 per cent.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Section 18 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Section 18(a) of the Act prohibits a registered closed-end investment company from issuing any class of senior security unless the company complies with the asset coverage requirements set forth in the section. ``Asset coverage'' is defined in section 18(h) to mean the ratio which the value of the total assets of an issuer, less all liabilities not represented by senior securities, bears to the aggregate amount of senior securities of such issuer. Under section 18(a), senior securities of closed-end investment companies representing indebtedness must have an asset coverage of 300% immediately after their issuance and senior securities of such companies representing stock must have an asset coverage of 200%. Section 18(c) prohibits a registered closed-end investment company from issuing more than one class of senior securities representing indebtedness. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Bando, the SBL Subsidiary, and the Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiary are subject to the asset coverage requirements of section 18(a) on an individual basis, and Bando on a consolidated basis because Bando may be an indirect issuer of senior securities with respect to the SBL and Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiaries' indebtedness. Accordingly, Bando would be required to treat as its own any liabilities of the SBL and Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiaries. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Absent exemptive relief, the asset coverage limitations of section 18(a) would prevent the SBL Subsidiary from using borrowings from Bando to fund 7(a) Program loans. Similarly, without an exemption, section 18(c) would preclude the SBL Subsidiary from issuing more than one class of securities to finance such borrowings. In addition, if deemed to be an indirect issuer of the SBL Subsidiary's indebtedness, sections 18 (a) and (c) would impose the same limitations on Bando with respect to the SBL Subsidiary's borrowings on a consolidated basis. Accordingly, applicants request an exemption from 18(a) to the extent necessary to treat the SBL Subsidiary's borrowings from Bando as ``liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior securities'' within the meaning of section 18(h) in applying the asset coverage requirements of section 18(a). Applicants also request an exemption from section 18(c) to permit Bando and the SBL Subsidiary, on an individual basis, to have more than one class of senior security representing indebtedness, subject to condition 5 below. The organization and operation of the Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiary does not raise any issues under section 18 because it will not issue senior securities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Sections 8 and 30 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the absence of an exemption, each of Bando, the SBL Subsidiary, and the Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiary would be required to file annual amendments to its registration statement and transmit to its shareholders annual and/or semi-annual reports on form N&hyph;SAR pursuant to sections 8(b), 30(a), 30(b), and 30(d) and rules 8b&hyph;16, 30a&hyph;1, 30b1&hyph;1, and 30d&hyph;1. Applicants request an exemption to permit: (a) Bando to file on behalf of itself, the SBL Subsidiary, and the Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiary amendments to its registration statement containing information with respect to Bando, the SBL Subsidiary, and the Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiary on a consolidated basis only; (b) Bando to file on behalf of itself and the SBL Subsidiary semi-annual reports on form N&hyph;SAR containing information with respect to Bando, the SBL Subsidiary, and the Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiary on a consolidated basis only; and (c) Bando to transmit to its shareholders semi-annually reports containing the financial information for Bando, the SBL Subsidiary, and the Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiary on a consolidated basis only. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. Modification of Condition 6 of Prior Order <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Condition 6 of the Prior Order provides that if 10% or more of Bando's total assets on a consolidated basis are invested in assets other than securities issued by the SBIC Subsidiary, then, in addition to the consolidated financial statements of Bando and the SBIC Subsidiary, there shall be included in such reports separate financial statements of the SBIC Subsidiary. Absent exemptive relief, applicants assume that if 10% or more of Bando's total assets on a consolidated basis are invested in assets other than the SBIC, SBL, and Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiaries, separate financial statements would be required. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> November 21, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH;  </P> <P> CITY COUNCIL TABLES PIERSIDE PROJECT  </P> <P> In the wake of the overwhelming passage of a parks and beaches protection  initiative, the City Council has decided to table the controversial Pierside  Village project.  </P> <P> City Administrator Michael T. Uberuaga told the council this week that the  passage of Measure C will force a citywide referendum on the project.  </P> <P> Included in Pierside Village are at least two restaurants on paved land  abutting the beach, immediately south of the municipal pier.  </P> <P> Measure C, passed by a 73% margin on Nov. 6, prohibits the city from selling or  leasing park or beach land without both a majority vote of the City Council and  the city's voters.  </P> <P> Critics of Pierside Village have said it would ruin the city's ocean view and  would hamper public access to the beach. Supporters say the land in question --  now a paved parking lot -- would be beautified and the public would have easier  access to the beach.  </P> <P> Jonathan Chodos, representing Pierside Village's proposed developer, told the  council he does not think Measure C applies to the project.  </P> <P> But Uberuaga disagreed. "This project is affected (by Measure C). We do have a  memo from the city attorney's office indicating how this project is affected,"  he said.  </P> <P> The council agreed with Uberuaga's recommendation and unanimously voted to  defer action on Pierside Village pending the completion of a new master plan  for downtown redevelopment.

			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / VSEL cleared of aggressive bidding VSEL, the Barrow-based shipyard, was cleared by the Ministry of Defence of bidding too aggressively to win an order for a Royal Navy vessel in an attempt to put rival Swan Hunter out of business. Swan Hunter bid Pounds 210m for the contract to build a helicopter landing ship while VSEL, which has made only submarines at Barrow for some years, bid Pounds 140m. Allegations were made that the price gap was so great that VSEL had deliberately bid for the contract at a loss.</p>

			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / Gatt praises efforts to liberalise trade THE General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) has praised Brazil for its sweeping trade liberalisation programme, implemented despite serious economic difficulties in just two years. In a report yesterday the Gatt secretariat says the reforms have achieved impressive results in changing Brazil's tradition of inward-looking policies. However, Gatt warns that liberalisation efforts could be put at risk by failure to tackle rampant inflation and achieve sustained economic growth. Mr Celso Amorim, Brazil's Gatt ambassador, assured Gatt's governing council during discussion of the report that the new government of President Itamar Franco was committed to liberalisation. He said economic reforms commanded a growing consensus within Brazilian society. Mr Amorim said Brazil's former policy of import substitution and state intervention, under which it had built up its diversified industrial base to become the world's tenth biggest economy, had not failed but had reached its limits. Trade liberalisation has been a key element in Brazil's structural adjustment programme adopted by the incoming democratic government in March 1990 to stabilise the economy and boost industrial efficiency and competitiveness. Since 1990 the Brazilian government has scrapped almost all import restrictions, streamlined trade procedures and slashed tariffs. Remaining restrictions in the informatics sector are due to end this month and by mid-1993 tariffs will average just over 14 per cent against 41 per cent in 1989. However, the Gatt secretariat says price and exchange rate stability, and sustained economic growth, are 'a necessary condition' for consolidation of the reforms. 'Failure to control inflation, to revive economic activity, and to tackle rising unemployment, would increase the political odds against the success of the liberalisation experiment.' The report adds that Brazil's membership of the Southern Cone Common Market (Mercosur) cannot provide a substitute for a successful conclusion to the Uruguay Round of global trade talks, which would improve Brazil's access to markets in industrial nations for its exports.</p>

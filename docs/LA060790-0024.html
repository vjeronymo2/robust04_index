			<p><P> June 7, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHECKOUT COUNTER LINE CAN TELL YOU A LOT  </P> <P> Last week, I hurried into the supermarket to pick up a gallon of milk on my way  home from work. Scanning my options at the checkout counters, I decided to get  in line behind a woman who had only a basket rather than a cart. With her  sensible shoes and regular green coat, she seemed a perfectly ordinary-looking  woman in her early 50s.  </P> <P> Then I glimpsed into her basket. She had: two enormous bags of bird seed, one  large bag of unshelled peanuts, one large bag of unshelled almonds and two  large bags of unshelled walnuts. Nothing else. Not a container of yogurt or a  can of soup.  </P> <P> My friends say, fondly of course, that I'm a "nosybody." I think of myself as  following Henry James' advice -- "Be one of those on whom nothing is missed" --  but either way, I've been like this since I was tall enough to look into the  neighbors' windows.  </P> <P> This personal detail notwithstanding, I have to confess that I'm always  surprised at the assumption, widely reiterated on talk shows and in newspaper  columns, that city dwellers live their lives unnoticed. Well, not by me they  don't.  </P> <P> The pigeon-and-squirrel lady's supermarket basket was, like all of ours, a  picture window with no curtains, revealing what was probably her most  extravagant idiosyncrasy. Who needs to read in the National Enquirer about a  lady who eats with the elephants when you find her right ahead of you in the  checkout line?  </P> <P> Of course, a professional "basketcaser" discovers the banal as often as the  bizarre. Take me, for instance. Had my neighborhood St. Frances of Assisi  peered into my boring old basket she would have known from the gallon of 1%  milk that a lot of my life is Kinder and Kuche.  </P> <P> And cereal choice, it turns out, speaks eloquently about family life. Anyone  loading up on cereals with bits shaped like identifiable objects -- vampire  bats or wheels with spokes -- or tinged in horrible greens or blues probably  has children old enough to nag persistently.  </P> <P> As for socioeconomic matters, the supermarket cart can reveal more than the tax  return. Those people stocking up on shiitake mushrooms, endive and pignoli nuts  -- you just know they have a Cuisinart at home. But don't be misled by the  people with those dreadful black-and-white boxes from the no-frills section.  The people who collect those stark boxes probably also save string and rubber  bands.  </P> <P> It's easy to determine who lives alone and who doesn't. Single men seem to  spend a lot of their free time in the supermarket; the surest sign of their  eligibility is the fact that they eschew carts and favor baskets. Not long ago,  I saw a man, wearing Topsiders and looking very L.L. Beanish, heading for the  cat food section. After that, he bought three cans of tuna fish, lettuce and  three oranges. Clearly, he was not a bachelor under the sway of Julia Child,  but at least he wasn't a man who subsisted on garbage.  </P> <P> Recently, I saw a woman in a jogging outfit, with yogurt, tofu, wheat germ and  Evian water in her basket. The potato chips also in there bespoke either an  errand for someone else or a refreshing lack of rigidity. In either case, I  felt kindly disposed to her.  </P> <P> I've now managed to get my husband interested in these matters too, and he came  home the other day concerned about the health and longevity of our local  firefighters. He'd seen one of them stocking up on enough steak to feed the  entire crew for a week, which is probably exactly what his intentions were, and  my husband spent the rest of the day worrying about their collective  cholesterol.  </P> <P> Of course, meanings don't always line up as neatly as Pringle's potato chips.  Sometimes the contents of a cart -- or what the goods mean, anyhow -- remain as  opaque as a tin can of spinach. Once I watched a man pace aisle after aisle. He  finally turned up at the checkout counter with one spice jar of crystallized  ginger, one jar of poppy seeds and one bottle of horseradish. After prolonged  inner wrestling (during which the cashier clicked her very long red fingernails  against her register impatiently), the man decided against purchasing the  horseradish. What could have been on his mind? I think I really didn't want to  know.  </P> <P> The most recent (and most fascinating) cart I saw had in it: four small boxes  of animal crackers, a pineapple, a yahrzeit candle, a package of flavoring for  Italian dressing and several very elaborate boxes of frozen vegetables. The  woman wheeling it was black.  </P> <P> Thrilled at my own first speculations about her life -- was she an Ethiopian  Jew with four young children who like pineapple marinade? -- I decided to stalk  her, subtly, of course. I noticed she put the animal crackers back on the  shelf. Then I watched her put back the packet of salad dressing. Had she  counted up her money and realized she hadn't brought enough? Then the pineapple  rejoined its tropical companions. Was she only returning things? What could  this mean?  </P> <P> I hurried around to the other side of the fruit bin to get a better view of the  woman's cart and the woman herself. And that's when I saw what Henry James  would certainly not have missed. The woman was wearing a name tag, a big round  name tag with the familiar A&amp;P logo. She was simply an employee reshelving  items.  </P> <P> Chastened, I went home in a hurry, leaving behind my basket of peanut butter  and borderline junk food for her to contemplate if she cared to.  </P></p>

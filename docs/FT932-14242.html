			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Arts: In the right place at the right time / Review of Georgia O'Keeffe, long-standing doyenne of American art Reputation was ever an insecure quality, and never more so than in our own time. Yet we grow oddly reluctant, not so much to question as actually to prick the bubble. Or is it perhaps that in this age of free-standing, self-sustaining fame, the bubble has become more resilient, impervious, more a sort of rubber ball? In the world of art, certainly, there are reputations that once established, just go bouncing on and on, the vested interests of commerce, tourism or national pride, as the case may be, simply too interested to miss a beat. As for the lucky artist, the trick is often simply to be in the right place at the right time and, if the luck is really in, then to let the reputation float quite free of the work as such. Georgia O'Keeffe had all the luck she could have wanted, let alone needed. She was a woman of striking if severe beauty, married to a remarkable photographer, Alfred Stieglitz, who had encouraged her in her early career and largely created and sustained her personal image. Her country needed her, in the sense that in her prime, between the wars, there were few other artists indigenous to America that could be promoted convincingly in terms of international modernism, and none at all so particularly and romantically American in her subject-matter - the wide, open spaces of the south-western desert states of America, the old frontier. She lived to an immense old age, dying at 99 in 1986, the long-standing doyenne of American art, loaded with honours and quite beyond criticism. Now there is the Georgia O'Keeffe Foundation, at Abiquiu in New Mexico, to keep her reputation for posterity. It is only when we come to the work itself, the foundation upon which this impressive edifice of reputation is set, that the questions and the doubts come flooding in - or do they? The wonderful irony of this present exhibition is that so judiciously critical an opportunity should be presented to us as the vindication and celebration of a great artist's career and achievement, and sent on a world-wide tour. I am all for the proper critical study of any substantial reputation, that must take its chance for good or ill. And the Hayward Gallery, at my mid-week visit just after Easter, was filled by a studious and, more to the point, respectful crowd, predominantly young and - should I even notice, let alone say such a thing? - female. Clearly the work strikes a plangent chord in many breasts, and it is easy to see why. Whatever its other qualities, a characteristic O'Keeffe has a graphic simplicity that reproduces well. Posters and cards have made her imagery familiar to a general audience far beyond the particular interest of modern art, and the explicitly sexual and ecstatic connotations of her flower-heads, seen in exploratory close-up, of bare, rolling hills and eroded valleys, swirling clouds and symbolic abstractions, are obvious enough. The metaphor of woman celebrating and idealising her own sexuality is irresistible to the feminist, which constituency today is enormous. And it is quite as hard for the more disinterested viewer to resist the conclusion that the general response to the work of Georgia O'Keeffe hangs entirely on the nature of its imagery. For when we come to examine these paintings as painting, they reveal themselves as poor, thin stuff indeed. The first surprise is how little of it there is, to stand for so long a life, but the greater surprise is the lack of any true development within it. Changes in immediate preoccupation there may have been, now flowers, now skies, now the embarrassingly inept surrealist pastiches of the 1950s, but technically they remain the same. Small or large, always they are out of scale, the paint on the surface inadequate or inappropriate to the purpose, the drawing flaccid, the mark light, uncertain, perfunctory. And there is no real sense of the artist looking hard at the real world, whether to allow painterly invention to feed intuitively upon the subject before it, or to develop later into informed abstraction. Rather it is that the image is all - which is another way of saying that the painter is no painter at all. For the true painter is always quite as much engrossed in the stuff of the painting he is making, as the pigment comes of the brush on to the canvas, as he is in the external reference or stimulus. With Georgia O'Keeffe there is the initial look, but no scrutiny, and the paint a mere question of filling in between the lines. Her barn in the snow might as well have ben painted by an artist who had never seen snow, but only told that it was white. Her tree-trunks, writhing together, are paper-thin, volumeless, cut crisp and clean as scenery at their edges and overlays. Her skyscraper is but a matter of poorly-drawn white blocks on a dark ground. Her little wooden virgin, so charming a votive figure at first sight, stands unresolved in all its proper form and significant detail. I suspect she used photographic reference far more than has been admitted, for the photograph, notoriously deceptive, always withholds more information than ever it offers as image. Clearly she believed in her own myth, which remains evidently potent after her death. The hard truth is that she was a weak draughtsman and at best an indifferent painter. Was it her sense of her own technical inadequacies that moved her to break with the art schools, where she had studied and taught, and go west into the desert? 'Where I was born and where and how I have lived is (sic) unimportant. It is what I have done with where I have been that should be of interest.' Indeed it should be.

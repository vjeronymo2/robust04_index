			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / Supreme Court to rule on Haiti refugee policy THE US Supreme Court yesterday agreed to pass judgment on the legality of the administration's policy of intercepting would-be Haitian refugees on the high seas and returning them home, writes Jurek Martin. A ruling will probably not be handed down before next year. Until then the court's temporary nullification, issued in August, of an Appeal Court decision overturning the policy will stand. The Bush administration's contention is that its facilities at the naval base in Guantanamo, Cuba, were being swamped by the tide of Haitian boat people and defended its programme, saying it was trying to protect the lives of Haitians who were attempting to make the journey in overloaded, unseaworthy boats. The administration also said the Haitians were trying to enter the US to escape poverty, not political persecution. Only applications for asylum and refugee status lodged at the US consulate at Port-au-Prince are being processed. In briefs filed with the Supreme Court yesterday, government lawyers contended that the Appeal Court ruling 'intruded into a delicate area of foreign policy'. Attorneys for the Haitian refugees argued that the policy contravened both US and international law and rendered the US Coast Guard 'agents of a murderous dictatorship in Haiti'. The Supreme Court yesterday rejected a claim that US reparations to Japanese-Americans interned during the second world war unconstitutionally denied payment to others because of their race, AP adds. The court, without comment, refused to hear an appeal by a man who said he was interned as a child with his German father but was excluded from the 1988 payment programme.</p>

			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / HK Land acquires 14.99% of Trafalgar HONGKONG LAND, one of the colony's leading property investment and development companies, yesterday acquired 14.99 per cent of Trafalgar House, the UK property, engineering and construction group. It immediately announced it was going to tender for another 15 per cent of Trafalgar's shares and would seek to place representatives on the board. Hongkong Land said it wanted to remain a minority shareholder and not offer to acquire Trafalgar's remaining shares for at least 12 months unless there were 'material changes of circumstances'. These could include an indication by Trafalgar's board that it would welcome an offer from Hongkong Land, or a bid from a third party. Trafalgar's ordinary shares yesterday rose 29p to 89 1/2 p and its A shares 28 1/2 p to 86p. Hongkong Land paid 85p per ordinary share and 82p per A share. Trafalgar's advisers believe Hongkong Land has set a floor of85p for its ordinary shares which recently fell to 50p. Sir Eric Parker, Trafalgar's chief executive, said: 'To try and get control of a company by buying up to a third of its shares at depressed prices is not the way we do things here.' Trafalgar said the price paid by Hongkong Land did not reflect the underlying net worth and prospects of the group and earlier 'strongly advised' shareholders not to sell. The group described its strategy after a board meeting with its financial advisers, Kleinwort Benson and Lazard Brothers, its joint stockbrokers, Cazenove and UBS Phillips &amp; Drew Securities, and its solicitor, Ashurst Morris Crisp. Some of Trafalgar's biggest shareholders sold shares to Hongkong Land's broker, Warburg Securities, but said they were unsure whether to take advantage of the tender offer. Hongkong Land's decision to take a stake in Trafalgar surprised the group. Jardine Matheson, which controls a third of Hongkong Land, jointly owns Gammon, a large Hong Kong contractor, with Trafalgar House.

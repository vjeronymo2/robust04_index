			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / Caracas to accelerate sell-off programme THE Venezuelan government plans to accelerate its privatisation programme with the sale of more than 100 enterprises and minority shareholdings by the end of 1993. Mr Carlos Hernandez Delfino, president of the Venezuelan Investment Fund responsible for privatisation, said the programme would include the sale of three electricity generation and distribution companies - Enelbar, Enelven and Enelco. The sale of the Planta Centro thermal power generation plant is also planned. The privatisation programme has been almost moribund since an attempted military coup in February, which marked the beginning of a period of political turmoil in the country. Government figures suggest only Dollars 17m (Pounds 9.5m) has been raised in privatisations so far this year. Mr Hernandez Delfino said late last week in an interview that the government was 'totally committed to the privatisation programme.' Many enterprises that belonged to the defunct Venezuelan Development Corp can be sold as soon as the government is ready. The assets of one, Ceramicas Cumana, will be auctioned tomorrow.</p>

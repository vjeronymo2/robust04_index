			<p>910415 FT  15 APR 91 / UK Company News: Tootal in war of words TOOTAL, the textile group, listed several reasons in another document yesterday why shareholders should reject the Pounds 194m hostile offer from Coats Viyella. This was frozen last Friday until the Office of Fair Trading decides whether or not to refer the bid to the Monopolies &amp; Mergers Commission, writes Roy Perry. Among allegations made by Tootal is that its rival has not demonstrated the mangement skills necessary to integrate acquisitions effectively. It claimed Vantona Viyella and Coats Patons made in total almost Pounds 50m more pre-tax profits as separate entities in 1985 than the merged group in 1990. The 'compelling logic' for a merger of the two businesses was flawed, according to Tootal, which asserted that Coats was attempting to disguise its failed textile conglomerate strategy by trying to buy Tootal on the cheap. Tootal argued that it has the right management, strategy and resources to prosper as an independent group. Coats Viyella countered swiftly. Mr Neville Bain, chief executive, said yesterday: 'Tootal's change of mind on the logic of this merger is breathtaking and raises fresh doubts about its credibility and strategy.' He answered the failed strategy accusation with 'the merger of Vantona Viyella and Coats Patons has been successful and its financial results must be judged in the context of world-wide textile cycles since it was consummated.' 'The Tootal board has denied shareholders important financial information by withholding its balance sheet and cash flows and details of extraordinary items. What is it trying to hide from them about its financial position,' asked Mr Bain.</p>

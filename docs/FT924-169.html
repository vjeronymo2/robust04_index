			<p>921230 FT  30 DEC 92 / Leading Article: Act swiftly on Sunday trading THE FRENZY of the new year holiday sales is as good a time as any to reflect upon the illogicalities of the laws which govern shop opening hours in Britain. Shortly before Christmas, the European Court of Justice ruled that the UK's restrictions on Sunday trading were not invalid under the Treaty of Rome. That leaves the thousands of stores which currently open on Sundays in breach of the Shops Act 1950. It also allows zealous local authorities free rein to seek injunctions stopping such stores from opening on Sundays. Now that there is no doubt about the validity of the Shops Act, the reform of this archaic, unworkable and unpopular law is a priority. The government has promised to bring forward legislation to reform the Sunday trading law early in the new year, but on a leisurely timetable. The new legislation is unlikely to be in place much before 1994. Following the defeat of a previous attempt to deregulate shopping hours in 1986, at the hands of a skilful alliance of sabbatarians and shopworkers' unions, the government plans to offer parliament three choices: Reform of the Shops Act to preserve the current restrictions while tidying up some of the more bizarre anomalies. Partial deregulation to allow small shops complete freedom to open on Sundays while restricting the opening hours of larger stores. Total deregulation - as has already happened in Scotland. Obvious danger This approach has the merit that a government with a small majority does not stick its neck out too far, but it also courts an obvious danger, that none of the three options will command majority support, so preserving the Shops Act. Anything less than full deregulation would be a mistake: partial measures will inevitably throw up further anomalies like those which have cast the Shops Act into disrepute. Currently the courts are required to fine shops selling bibles on the sabbath while permitting the sale of pornography. Complete deregulation is right because it allows individuals a choice otherwise denied. For shop-owners, Sunday opening offers the opportunity to make more efficient use of capital. They can also compete against other attractions for the consumers' money - garden centres and DIY stores closed on Sundays lose business to cinemas, restaurants and pubs. Equally, many people who work Monday to Friday welcome the freedom to shop on Sundays rather being forced to join the Saturday rush. This is why 16m people have taken advantage of Sunday shopping since the law was thrown into confusion. There is no reason why they should be denied this convenience, so long as shopworkers who prefer not to work on Sundays are not compelled to do so. Coalition for change The question for the government's business managers should be how best to achieve the desirable objective of full deregulation. One possibility might be to draw Labour into a coalition for change by working at the legal protection available to prevent staff being forced to work on Sundays or disadvantaged if they decline requests to do so. This is not a simple matter, but there are precedents in employment protection law to encourage the belief that the task is possible. Another tactical gambit might be to provide local authorities with the power to hold referendums on the issue of Sunday trading in their own areas. This device has been used, successfully, to test opinion on pub licensing hours and, it is easily forgotten south of the border, Scotland has already liberalised Sunday trading with no perceivable ill consequences. Such referendums could easily be held on the same day as council elections and would have the added advantage of adding some genuine local issue excitement to these contests. Those in favour of deregulation would have reason to be confident of the outcome. But, however the government assembles a majority, it must act fast: the European Court of Justice ruling removes the last alibis for inaction. Speedy deregulation of Sunday shopping hours should be one of the government's new year resolutions.</p>

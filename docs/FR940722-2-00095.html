Boomer has been a nuclear medicine technologist since 1972. On February 11, 1993, Mr. Boomer, as the President of Chesapeake Imaging Center, Inc. (CIC or Licensee) applied for an NRC license. On March 23, 1993 Materials License No. 47&hyph;25238&hyph;01 was issued to CIC by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC or Commission) pursuant to 10 CFR parts 30 and 35. The license authorized the possession and use of radiopharmaceuticals for nuclear medicine activities in accordance with the conditions specified therein. The license was terminated this date. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On July 30, 1993, the NRC conducted an initial inspection of CIC at its facility located in Chesapeake, West Virginia. As a result of the inspection, multiple violations of NRC requirements were identified. One specific violation identified involved the failure to perform weekly surveys for removable contamination in the nuclear medicine department between March 24 and July 30, 1993. As a result of this inspection, a Notice of Violation is being issued contemporaneously with this Order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Between August 3 and September 30, 1993, an investigation was conducted by the NRC Office of Investigations (OI) to determine if certain violations identified during the July 30, 1993, inspection were the result of deliberate misconduct. Based on investigative findings, the NRC staff concludes that Mr. Boomer deliberately caused CIC to violate the requirement to perform the weekly contamination surveys, after being advised by the CIC facility Manager and CIC technical consultant that such surveys were required. Mr. Boomer was aware of the NRC requirement to perform weekly contamination surveys, yet deliberately failed to meet the requirement in violation of 10 CFR 35.70(e) and 10 CFR 30.10. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A transcribed telephone enforcement conference between the NRC staff and Mr. Boomer was held on March 8, 1994. Mr. Boomer indicated during the enforcement conference that he had significant difficulties in obtaining the funds from investors and did not recognize the severity of the noncompliance but rather focused on the needs of patients traveling miles to obtain the studies. Mr. Boomer also stated during the enforcement conference that he did accept responsibility for not obtaining the equipment in a more timely fashion and for not notifying NRC and indicated that he would exercise better judgment in the future. From the discussions at the enforcement conference, the staff believes an order to remove Mr. Boomer from involvement in NRC-licensed activities is warranted based on (1) The deliberate noncompliance with the NRC's weekly survey requirement, (2) the fundamental lack of assurance that he will in the future comply with Commission requirements, (3) his position as President, (4) his approximate 20 years experience in NRC-licensed activities, and (5) his decision to continue operations although he knew he was not in compliance with the weekly survey requirement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based on the above, Mr. Boomer engaged in deliberate misconduct which caused the licensee to be in violation of 10 CFR 35.70(e). The NRC must be able to rely on the Licensee and its employees to comply with NRC requirements, including the requirement to perform weekly contamination surveys. Compliance with the NRC requirement to perform weekly contamination surveys is necessary to protect members of the public as well as Licensee employees from unnecessary radiation exposure that could result from undetected radioactive contamination. Performance of weekly contamination surveys is an important safety requirement intended to prevent radioactive contamination of patients, employees and other members of the public. Mr. Boomer's deliberate actions in causing the Licensee to violate these requirements have raised serious doubts as to whether he can be relied on to be involved in NRC-licensed activities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consequently, I lack the requisite reasonable assurance that licensed activities can be conducted in compliance with the Commission's requirements and that the health and safety of the public will be protected if Mr. Boomer were permitted at this time to be involved in NRC-licensed activities. Therefore, the public health, safety and interest require that Mr. Boomer be prohibited from any involvement in NRC-licensed activities for a period of three years from the date of this Order, and if he is currently involved with another licensee in NRC-licensed activities, he must immediately cease such activities, and inform the NRC of the name, address and telephone number of the employer, and provide a copy of this order to the employer. During this period Mr. Boomer also shall be required to provide a copy of this Order to any prospective employer who engages in NRC-licensed activities prior to the time that Mr. Boomer accepts employment with such prospective employer. The purpose of this notice is so that any prospective employer is aware of Mr. Boomer's prohibition from engaging in NRC-licensed activities. Additionally, Mr. Boomer is required to notify the NRC of his first employment in NRC-licensed activities following the prohibition period. Furthermore, pursuant to 10 CFR 2.202, I find that the significance of Mr. Boomer's conduct described above is such that the public health, safety and interest require that this Order be immediately effective. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, pursuant to sections 81, 161b, 161c, 161i, 161o, 182 and 186 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 2.202, 10 CFR 30.10, and 10 CFR 150.20, it is hereby ordered, effective immediately, that: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Mr. John W. Boomer is prohibited for three years from the date of this Order from any involvement in NRC-licensed activities. NRC-licensed activities are those activities which are conducted pursuant to a specific or general license issued by the NRC, including, but not limited to, those activities of Agreement State licensees conducted pursuant to the authority granted by 10 CFR 150.20. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

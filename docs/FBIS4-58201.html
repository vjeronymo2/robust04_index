			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["News report by al-Quds radio correspondents"--read by </F> announcer]    [Text] Nabil Sha'th [head of the Palestinian negotiating  delegation in Cairo] is carrying the glad tidings of his  determination to stay in the hall where capitulation  negotiations are being held until his dream of reaching an  agreement on the implementation of the so-called self-rule is  achieved at the expense of our people and their objectives.    We realize Nabil Sha'th's need to expedite the achievement  of  his dream so that the doors will open to his political  consultations and his trade companies for his sons and relatives  so that they can enter the territories that have been forbidden  to them and so that they can inherit the companies,  institutions, calculators, and typewriters of the coming  authority. But, we wanted Nabil Sha'th and his group to visit,  instead, one of the Zionist barriers that prevent our people  from reaching the al-Aqsa Mosque to perform their prayers and  from reaching the markets so that the defenseless citizens will  be able to buy even some of their necessities and find some food  for their children.    Our correspondents from the West Bank and Gaza Strip report:  We wanted Nabil Sha'th to see al-Malha market, which was built  by the Zionist enemy, so that he could see how the operation of  stabbing two Zionist soldiers yesterday has shown the  ineffectiveness of the Zionist siege on Jerusalem and its  suburbs.    We wanted Sha'th to come to Ya'bad and Barta'ah to see how  the soldiers of terrorist Rabin raid our people's homes and  wreak havoc and destruction inside them. But, Sha'th insists on  staying in Cairo. From there, he can emerge from his seclusion,  which has lasted more than 24 hours, to stand in front of  cameras and television screens and announce that an agreement  has been reached, which he has announced dozens of times. He  insists on staying in Cairo so that he can meet with Shulamit  Aloni, the Zionist minister who has bragged in front of many  Arabs that the doors of the entire world are now open to the  Zionist entity.    Sha'th insists on seclusion until the signing of the  agreement but, of course, he does not hesitate to receive the  raven, the godfather [al-ghurab al-'arrab], Christopher, after  his U.S.-Zionist administration granted the so-called self-rule  policemen cars to be used to protect the Zionist settlers in  Gaza and Jericho and to repress our people who stress their  rejection of the accord of disgrace and treason.    What really counts is not seclusion but the continued heroic  actions, like yesterday, which was known as the day of knife war.    As we wait for the results of the open session, until the  'Arafat-Zionist agreement is signed, and for the results of  Christopher's tour of the region, Zionist terrorism against our  people continues, far from the atmosphere of Sha'th's optimism.  Moreover, land confiscation continues in order to open more  settlement roads and to displace our people.    Within this context, terrorist (Gabriash 'Ahahl), the  so-called security officer in the settlement council in Hebron,  warned about another massacre similar to the holy al-Ibrahimi  Mosque massacre. It should also be noted that the head of the  settlements council in Qiryat Arba' earlier made threats before  the Zionist committee investigating the holy Ibrahimi Mosque  massacre that a new massacre would be perpetrated in Hebron by a  settler using a machine gun against the Arabs.    Our kinsfolk in Hebron, who are facing this Zionist threat  with more patience and giving, refuted the military spokesman's  claims that martyr al-Waridat tried to stab a Zionist soldier.  Citing eyewitnesses, the Zionist newspaper THE JERUSALEM POST  affirms that these claims are false. The paper notes that these  claims are false and that the criminal soldier had been known to  be carrying out repressive and barbaric acts against the  citizens in Hebron for weeks.    At the end of their news report, our correspondents warned  against Zionist deception in light of this game of distracting  the attention of the Palestinians by preoccupying them with the  issue of redeploying Rabin's soldiers in the Gaza Strip and  Jericho. It has also been noted that the Zionists are taking  advantage of certain gaps in our people's ranks, created by  'Arafat's supporters, in order to strike at their unity and  undermine their efforts through secondary issues which, as  everyone knows, are nothing more than a cheap Zionist bribe to  the pro-'Arafat delegation in order to peddle the accord of  treason.    Moreover, the our correspondents warned against these  meetings that some Palestinian opposition members are holding  with representatives of the Zionist Israeli military command,  which is not seeking their opinion on the Muslims' position on  the Oslo accord inasmuch as they are seeking to drive a wedged  into the Palestinian ranks and to break their solidarity for  refusing to deal with the Zionists.</p>

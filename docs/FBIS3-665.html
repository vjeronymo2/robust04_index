Matlala] </F>   [Text] Pretoria March 11 SAPA -- The South African  Government and the Transitional Executive Council [TEC] will  jointly take over the administration of Bophuthatswana, African  National Congress [ANC] President Nelson Mandela said on Friday  [11 March].    Addressing about 2,000 South African and Bophuthatswana  workers at a public forum in Pretoria, Mr Mandela said he was in  touch with State President F. W. de Klerk and Minister of  Defence Mr Kobie Coetsee. He said they agreed on Friday morning  on the deployment of South African Defence Force [SADF]  personnel in the territory. A unit of the SADF had been  deployed at the South African Embassy in Bophuthatswana, he  added. "This operation should not be seen as a military  operation only but as an operation to bring about law and order  in the place. This is not to restore (Bophuthatswana President  Lucas) Mangope or anyone else just as discredited. It is for  the people of Bophuthatswana to be able to administer their own  country," Mr Mandela said.    Now that the SADF was deployed in the homeland it was  important the government and the executive council ensured that  workers go back to their jobs and that their pensions were  secured.    Mr Mandela urged workers to leave the matter in the hands of  the government and the council. He warned people against  looting and destroying property, calling on them to respect  other peoples' property.</p>

			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / World Trade News: Gulf Air in Dollars 600m Airbus order AIRBUS Industrie strengthened its grip on the Middle Eastern aircraft market yesterday with an order worth almost Dollars 600m (about Pounds 300m) from Gulf Air. Gulf Air, jointly owned by Oman, Qatar, Bahrain and Abu Dhabi, is buying six Airbus A340s, the biggest aircraft in the Airbus range, and taking options on another six. Gulf Air will be the first Middle East carrier to operate the A340 when it receives the first in spring 1994. Each aircraft will be powered by four engines made by CFM International, a venture between General Electric of the US and Snecma of France. The purchase is in addition to plans by Gulf Air to invest Dollars 1.7bn over the next three years in 18 new aircraft, flights to 10 new destinations and more facilities and personnel. Gulf Air is a long-established customer of Airbus. It has ordered 12 Airbus A320s, a smaller model, two of which are in service on routes within the Gulf. The order is a boost for Airbus after Emirates, another expansion-minded Middle Eastern airline, decided to buy Boeing's new model, the 777. The A340 is a new model set to enter service with Lufthansa early next year. Three of the world's automated airline ticket reservation systems are linking their computers. The tie-up is between Amadeus, owned by Air France, Lufthansa and Iberia; Worldspan, owned by TWA and Delta of the US, and Abacus, owned by five Asian airlines. Worldspan and Abacus also have stakes in each other. The link will allow travellers who arranged itineraries on one network to change their plans through a travel agent which subscribes to one of the other two. The arrangement goes some way to improving the competitive positions of Amadeus, Worldspan and Abacus against the two world leaders, Sabre, owned by America Airlines, and Galileo/Apollo, owned by 11 airlines in the US and Europe.</p>

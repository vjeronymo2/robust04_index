			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In &sect;7 of the RSERA, recodified at 49 U.S.C. 20141, Congress mandated that the Secretary ``prescribe standards regarding dynamic brake equipment.'' FRA interprets this mandate to require the development of meaningful and enforceable standards to address the safe use of dynamic brakes. As stated previously, FRA believes that any meaningful standards regarding dynamic brakes must include provisions for providing the locomotive engineer with continuous information on the current status of the dynamic brakes. Currently, the only means of providing this continuous information to the engineer is some type of dynamic brake display in the cab of the locomotive. Consequently, in order to comply with Congress' mandate requiring meaningful standards to address the safe use of dynamic brakes, FRA proposes that locomotives built after January 1, 1996, and equipped with dynamic brakes, be able to (i) test the electrical integrity of the dynamic brake at rest and (ii) display the total train dynamic brake retarding force, at certain speed increments, in the cab of the controlling locomotive.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the ANPRM (57 FR 62555), FRA requested comments from the industry on possible methods of providing information regarding the status of dynamic brakes to the engineer in the cab of the controlling locomotive. The only workable option presented to FRA in the comments received was the equipping of locomotives with a dynamic brake display. Although FRA recognizes that the technology for dynamic brake displays with the ability to provide the type of information sought by FRA is not readily available today, several commenters suggested that it is currently being developed. FRA believes that the benefits of such an indicator would be to alert engineers that they have diminished or excessive dynamic capabilities, thus permitting the engineer to control the braking of their train in the safest possible manner. However, in order to fully evaluate the viability of this proposal, FRA seeks comments from all interested parties regarding the following specific issues:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) What is the status on the future availability of dynamic brake indicators capable of providing the information required by this proposal?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Are FRA's cost estimates regarding this proposal accurate?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) What quantitative and/or qualitative operational or safety benefits can be derived from the use of these devices?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) What alternative methods are available for providing the same information that a dynamic brake indicator would provide to a locomotive engineer? What are the costs?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) What are the operating and maintenance experiences of the dynamic brake monitoring devices currently used on high speed passenger trains?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Would automatic blending between friction and dynamic brakes prevent an engineer from overrelying on dynamic brakes and provide the same safety benefit as monitoring the status of the dynamic brake?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) Are there other available measures that would fulfill the requirement of Section 7 referred to above? If so, please provide information or analysis regarding their cost, effectiveness, practicability, and enforceability.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Section 232.113.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section proposes design standards for intermediate speed and high speed train brakes. FRA recognizes that much of the equipment covered by these proposed standards is still in the developmental stages of existence; however, FRA recognizes that the operation of higher speed trains will occur in the near future. FRA feels, therefore, that steps need to be taken now to ensure the safe operation of this type of equipment. In addition, most of the proposed standards are either general in nature or are performance-oriented and, thus, would not impede the development of new technologies. Furthermore, the proposed standards would not apply to intermediate speed passenger equipment that entered service prior to January 1, 1995. FRA does not intend to disrupt existing passenger service in the Northeast Corridor or in other high speed corridors; however, as new service is developed or new equipment is put into service on these corridors, it would become subject to the design requirements proposed in this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FRA feels that trains that operate at speeds in excess of 79 mph but not exceeding 125 mph should be classified as intermediate speed operations and that trains that operate at speeds in excess of 125 mph but not exceeding 160 mph should be classified as high speed operations. Pursuant to the statutory mandate, which requires two-way EOT devices on all trains exceeding 30 mph (with stated exceptions), FRA intends to require that all intermediate speed freight trains be equipped with two-way EOT devices, with no exceptions. FRA also proposes to require dynamic brakes on all locomotive and power cars used in intermediate speed or high speed service. FRA feels that as speed increases, the need for retarding force beyond that available from friction brakes alone also increases. Dynamic brakes also provide a valuable means of decreasing brake heating of wheels and/or axles. FRA also intends to require a means of monitoring the enroute performance and status of the dynamic brake on intermediate and high speed trains. Although the technology for this equipment is not currently available, several commenters suggested that it is in the process of being developed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pristina, 8 Jun (TANJUG) -- Kosovo District leader  Milos Simovic, and provincial information secretary Bosko  Drobnjak had talks in Pristina today with Jonathan Moore, head  of the State Department desk for Serbia and Montenegro, about  the political situation in the province, the position of  national minorities, and the possibilities for restoring  dialogue.    According to a public statement, Simovic said that the  political and security situation in the province is better this  year because more ethnic Albanian citizens have been meeting  their obligations toward the state. This was clearly influenced  by official statements by a number of diplomats and  representatives of the European states who, while visiting  Kosovo and Metohija, presented their governments' clear stand  regarding the inviolability of the borders of the Republic of  Serbia and Yugoslavia.    According to the statement, Jonathan Moore stated that his  country is abiding by the stance which rules out the possibility  of secession by any one part of the Republic of Serbia and  Yugoslavia. Milos Simovic stated that even though it has not  been officially registered as a party with the relevant  republican ministry, the Democratic Alliance of Kosovo has not  experienced any obstacles nor pressures in freely performing its  activities, despite the fact that it has been at the forefront  of the anti-Serbian campaign.    The talks were also attended by Matthew Palmer, a  representative of the U.S. Embassy in Belgrade.</p>

			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Abbey National buys CIBC's residential mortgage book Abbey National, the mortgage lender and banking group, has bought the Pounds 900m UK residential mortgage book of Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. Themortgage assets are equivalent to 2 per cent of Abbey's existing mortgage assets, and were purchased at an undisclosed discount to the book value. CIBC Mortgages has about 17,500 mortgage customers. These will benefit from a 0.25 percentage points cut in the interest rate they pay, which will fall to 8.2 per cent from March. Abbey National customers currently pay 7.74 per cent. The o peration employs 104 staff - most of them at Coventry - and will continue to be run as a separate organisation from the bank itself, called Abbey National Mortgage Finance. Apart from increasing Abbey's mortgage assets, the acquisition will also give it the capability to securitise future mortgages. Securitisation involves the selling of 'packages' of mortgages to a vehicle company, which issues bonds against them. It would allow the bank to devolve credit risks to investors, and also raise its return on capital by 're-using' it as it would release capital that regulatory guidelines require a bank to hold against assets. The bank does not intend to securitise the existing business, but may move down this route within the next couple of years. An essentialpart of the process is computer systems that have sufficient detailed information about individual mortgages to enable the payment risks for each one to be assessed. Mr Peter Birch, chief executive, highlighted the importance of thesystems the bank was gaining as part of the deal. 'Setting these up from scratch would be time-consuming and complex,' he said. The purchase is the most conspicuous example of a recent trend among more mainstream mortgage lenders to purchase the books of some lenders who entered the UK housing market in the 1980s and no longer see it as central to their business. Within the past year or so, Birmingham Midshires, the UK's 13th-largest society, has bought four mortgage books amounting to Pounds 295m. Mr Dan Ferguson, European vice-president of CIBC, said the departure from the UK residential mortgage market, which CIBC entered in 1986, 'is reflective of our previously announced decision to exit those of our European operations which are not a core component of our global investment and wholesale banking lines of business'.</p>

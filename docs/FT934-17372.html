			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / People: Taylor moves up from Cellnet Cellnet, the UK's second largest cellular operator, is about to get a new director now that Stafford Taylor is to be promoted to be BT's director of personal communications. Cellnet, a joint venture between BT and Securicor, lags behind Vodafone in subscri-bers and profits. But Taylor, managing director since 1989, has emerged with plaudits, given the constraints imposed on Cellnet by BT. Cellnet's successful pioneering of low user tariffs last year is particularly credited to him. The appointment of a new director - to be announced - will be watched closely for what it says about the priority BT chairman Iain Vallance gives to BT's sole cellular operation. After AT&amp;T's purchase of McCaw, Cellnet's low profile in the BT empire looks increasingly misplaced.</p>

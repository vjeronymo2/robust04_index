			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beginning in February, education workers in Matanzas  Province will analyze at the base level the need for rational  exploitation of the work force in this sector and will advocate  higher efficiency for teachers as well as nonteaching personnel.  Without implying a reduction in educational budgets, workers are  seeking solutions that would allow consolidation of classes in  several schools, establish multidisciplinary principles, and  fill the entire teaching and work schedule of the personnel.  This will undoubtedly result in the elimination of a number of  positions. However, according to preliminary analyses, only  2,500 workers out of 22,000 will lose their posts. These workers  will take retraining courses, sabbaticals, or other forms of  education, including informal education alternatives, to  maintain their ties with the education sector even if they end  up working in a sector such as the minibrigades.    Ninety-eight percent of the children in Matanzas are  enrolled  in school, with one teacher for every 14 students in all grades  and subjects. Highly developed countries have one teacher per 30  or more students. The state budget for education for 1994 is 75  million pesos; in the decade of the eighties, it reached 82  million pesos, proving that education is a priority despite  difficulties.</p>

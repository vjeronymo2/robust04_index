			<p><P> August 21, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FED TO RULE ON DEALERS OF U.S. BONDS IN JAPAN  </P> <P> When the governors of the Federal Reserve meet in Washington today, Japan's  most powerful financial institutions will be paying close attention. The Fed  will rule whether to allow seven Japanese securities firms to maintain their  status as primary dealers of U.S. government bonds.  </P> <P> That status is threatened by the Primary Dealers Act, a little-noticed  provision in last year's Omnibus Trade Bill that requires the Fed to deny a  primary dealership to any firm whose home country does not give U.S. companies  a fair opportunity to compete in its government securities market. The law  takes effect Wednesday.  </P> <P> Primary dealers are an elite group of companies authorized to deal directly  with the Fed when it buys and sells U.S. government bonds. Aside from prestige,  primary dealers gain new business opportunities, since many large investors in  government securities will only conduct business with primary dealers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Removal Doubtful  </P> <P> Fewer than 50 firms have primary dealer status, including four Japanese  securities firms (Nomura, Daiwa, Nikko, Yamaichi), and subsidiaries of three  Japanese banks (Industrial Bank of Japan, Sanwa, and Long-Term Credit Bank).  </P> <P> Most industry experts believe that the Fed will not remove the dealerships from  the Japanese, largely because recent reforms have opened new doors for foreign  financial companies in Japan.  </P> <P> "It's unlikely the Fed will rescind our primary dealership," says Scott Pardee,  chairman of Yamaichi International (America) Inc., a subsidiary of one of  Japan's Big Four securities firms.  </P> <P> The stakes are high. A ruling against the Japanese firms could disrupt the flow  of Japanese funds to the United States, making it more difficult to finance the  federal budget deficit. U.S.-Japan collaboration on other financial issues,  including third-world debt, could be hampered.  </P> <P> The reforms center on the method of distributing Japanese government bonds.  Shortly after the Primary Dealers Act passed last August (with the strong  backing of U.S. financial firms), Japan's Ministry of Finance sought to head  off a confrontation by announcing that 40% of all new 10-year bond issues would  be sold through a competitive auction system that took effect last April. The  remaining 60%, following the old system, is allocated in fixed shares to each  of the more than 800 firms that belong to an underwriting syndicate. The share  allotted to foreign firms has risen from 2.5% to 8%.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Syndicate Structure  </P> <P> Four foreign firms are now members of the syndicate's executive committee,  which negotiates the terms for new bond issues with the government. Salomon  Brothers Inc. is a permanent member, while nine other foreign firms divide up  the remaining three positions on a rotation basis.  </P> <P> Access of this kind was long sought by U.S. companies, since Japan's government  securities market is the second biggest in the world, after that of the United  States. By 1984, 15 foreign firms had joined the syndicate and the number is  now more than 60.  </P> <P> Until the 1980s, only a few foreign firms were active in the syndicate because  Japanese government securities were unattractive investments. The government  deliberately set yields below market rates to keep a lid on financing costs and  domestic interest rates. Japanese financial firms were forced to accept their  share of each new bond issue. But yields have gradually improved, and foreign  firms have tried to boost their participation.  </P> <P> The new access has been welcomed by U.S. firms as a big step toward competitive  markets.  </P> <P> The Securities Industry Association, a trade group, recommended to the Fed in  an early May memo that it "refrain from suspending or delaying the primary  dealer status of any foreign firm."  </P> <P> Improved access notwithstanding, many industry executives insist that their  firms still face competitive disadvantages in the Japanese government  securities market. The syndicate system continues to be controversial, since  large city banks receive the bulk of the 60% of new bond issues not subject to  competitive auction.  </P> <P> Another complaint is that structural features of the Japanese market affect  foreign firms disproportionately. In particular, the lack of a wide range of  secondary market trading activities in Japan deprives U.S. firms of their  competitive advantage in innovative trades like futures and options, and makes  it more difficult to finance costly bond market activities.  </P> <P> If the Fed decides to keep Japanese firms as primary dealers, but progress is  not made toward resolving these issues, then pressure to withdraw the primary  dealerships could easily rise again.  </P></p>

			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: PNG miner expects Lihir gold lease soon Niugini Mining, the Papua New Guinea-based company which is controlled by Canada's Battle Mountain Gold, said yesterday that it expected the crucial 'special mining lease' which would allow the ADollars 1bn-plus development of the Lihir gold mine to go ahead, to be issued before the end of the year. The Lihir project, which is joint venture between Britain's RTZ and Niugini Mining and would become one of the world's largest gold mines outside of South Africa, has been clouded by uncertainly for the best part of a year as the PNG government has debated the project's structure, and tried to determine what stake local landowners should be given. A break-through came in August, when Mr Paias Wingti, PNG's former prime minister, was replaced by Sir Julius Chan, who quickly indicated that priority would be given to resolving the situation. However, Niugini Mining's statement yesterday - part of its quarterly operations report - was the firmest indication of the timetable now expected. Niugini Mining said that the landowners' stake in the project would be met from the PNG government's share, which would be pegged at 30 per cent as originally planned. 'Landowners are expected to respond to a government proposal concerning landowner equity in late-October,' it said. Financing for the project is expected to comprise a mix of debt and equity - again, in line with the original scheme. Niugini Mining said work on the equity issue, halted earlier this year, had recommenced.</p>

			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Bangladeshi talks fail Commonwealth envoy Sir Ninian Stephen said yesterday that he had failed to end Bangladesh's protracted political crisis and would leave the country soon. 'I hope there can still be a peaceful and speedy resolution of the issues that today divide your political parties,' he said. 'Violence and uproar will achieve nothing. I urge the people of Bangladesh not to go down that road.' Bangladesh's political opposition has boycotted parliament since February and mounted other protests to try to force the government to resign and call elections under a caretaker administration. The elected government need not call new polls until 1996.</p>

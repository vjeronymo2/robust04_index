			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / Shopping centres hived off to form Pounds 800m listed company Shares are to be offered in a new property company which will own seven shopping centres, including the Lakeside complex in Thurrock, the largest in southern England. Capital Shopping Centres will become one of the seven largest listed property companies on the London Stock Exchange. It will have gross assets of Pounds 800m, of which Lakeside will account for half. CSC is being created by Transatlantic Holdings, the life assurance and property group, which is controlled by Mr Donald Gordon, the South African financier. He is best known for founding his country's largest insurance group, Liberty Life, and buying into the UK's Sun Life and Sun Alliance. Transatlantic, which is 54 per cent owned by Liberty Life and 19 per cent owned by France's largest insurer UAP, will retain about 75 per cent of the new company's shares (issued at net asset value). It will also keep its non-retail properties, worth Pounds 600m, and its half share of Sun Life and 3 per cent stake in Sun Alliance. The demerger will provide new funds for the retail operation. Transatlantic hopes it will also lead to a more attractive valuation for the retail properties. Brokers expected significant interest in the issue. 'I think the market will like the idea of having a large specialist retail property company,' said Mr Chris Turner, of Barclays de Zoete Wedd. According to the brokerage, the property sector is currently trading at a 19 per cent premium to its asset value, and it is expected that CSC will be priced above asset value. Transatlantic will also raise an additional Pounds 200m from a convertible bond issue. Mr Gordon, the chairman, said this was to pay off floating rate debt and the Pounds 162m recently paid to increase the company's interest in the Harlequin shopping centre in Watford. Of the seven shopping centres to be owned by CSC, three have been built since 1990. Mr Gordon argued that shopping centres needed five to seven years to reach maturity. Set against a background of increasing consumer confidence, he argued there was potential for a substantial increase in rental income. Excluding the Harlequin centre, CSC's rental income is estimated at Pounds 28.4m for 1993, and the Harlequin would be expected to contribute at least Pounds 10m in 1994. The flotation, planned for April, is to be co-sponsored by Morgan Stanley and Jardine Fleming.</p>

During the conference, the spirit of  the national forum of directors of organizational departments  was relayed. Yu Junbo, member of the provincial party standing  committee and director of the organizational department,  delivered a report to make organizational work arrangements for  the province this year.    During the work conference Gu Jinchi, secretary of the  provincial party committee, delivered an important speech on  conducting the organizational work under the new situation and  on having the province seize the opportunity and provide  reliable guarantees for accelerating development.    Gu Jinchi said: An important characteristic in the current  development in the country is a deep change cropping up in the  transformation from the planned economic system to the market  economic system. This has set new demands for the  organizational work, which chiefly are to seize the opportunity  and to accelerate development. In conducting organizational  work under the new situation, we should not only help cadres  upgrade their capability of having the market economy well in  mind but also help them gain the experience of building two  civilizations simultaneously. We should not only uphold the  principle of having the party manage cadres, but also provide a  fine environment for outstanding personnel to give full play to  their professional knowledge and skill.    Gu Jinchi said: We are encountering so many difficulties and  tasks for overcoming these difficulties and improving the  shortcomings are very arduous. Therefore, the organizational  work should assume important responsibility in this regard. The  organizational front should coordinate with the propaganda and  ideological front to do a good job in grasping the work of  having party members and cadres emancipate their minds and in  building leading bodies at all levels and party organizations at  grass-roots levels so as to bring into full play the enthusiasm  and creativeness of various talented personnel and to have them  fully play their role in the main battlefield of economic  construction.    Gu Jinchi urged the organizational departments to lead the  broad masses of party members and cadres to take the lead in  emancipating minds, as well as promoting the organizational work  and to continuously create a new situation in work by regarding  reform as a motive force.    Attending the work conference were Xu Wencai, member and  secretary general of the provincial party standing committee;  secretaries from the party committees under the provincial level  departments and bureaus; and directors from the organizational  departments of various cities.</p>

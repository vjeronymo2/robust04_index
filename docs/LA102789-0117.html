			<p><P> October 27, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> LEARN TO SPIN YARN FROM THE MASTERS AT THIS FESTIVAL OF JEWISH STORYTELLING  </P> <P> For the past 20 years, Ruthie Buell -- aka Uncle Ruthie -- has been performing  songs and stories on her KPFK radio show, "Halfway Down the Stairs." She loves  her job, which gives her the opportunity to tell stories about death, divorce,  strong women and alternative families.  </P> <P> "I talk about life the way it really is," said Buell, 59.  </P> <P> Although she has a passion for her work, she'll also say with equal zeal:  "There's a quality in storytelling that makes me sick. It's that saccharin type  of storytelling, when people speak at 33 1/3 r.p.m. in a 78 r.p.m. world.  There's a patronization when the voice changes and this invisible wall develops  between the storyteller and the audience."  </P> <P> Buell will have none of that.  </P> <P> When she, along with four other storytellers from across the country, performs  Sunday at A Jewish Storytelling Festival at the University of Judaism, the  storytellers will strive for the real thing -- real laughter, joy, tears and  intimacy.  </P> <P> "You want to make the audience feel like they're sitting in your kitchen over a  cup of coffee," explained Buell, who also teaches special education at Alfonso  B. Perez Special Education Center in East Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Sunday's festival also will feature storytellers Rabbi Lynn Gottlieb of  Albuquerque, N.M.; Joel Ben Izzy of San Francisco; Syd Liebermann of Evanston,  Ill., and Peninnah Schram of New York City. The program is set to include a  morning of storytelling performances by the five masters, with a series of  afternoon workshops afterward.  </P> <P> Workshops will cover adapting literary stories for oral presentation, using  family history for material, incorporating music and movement, and adapting  biblical text into storytelling.  </P> <P> Liebermann taught elementary school for 20 years before he turned to  storytelling seven years ago, now earning a living solely with his storytelling  skills. He will lead a workshop dealing with the process of turning real-life  anecdotes into interesting stories.  </P> <P> "There's so much gold in our lives we don't realize," Liebermann said. "We  gobble our existence and turn to machines for entertainment. Before radio and  television were around, we entertained one another by talking."  </P> <P> Liebermann, 45, thinks television shows such as "The Cosby Show" and "The  Wonder Years" succeed because they concentrate on telling good stories. "After  we watch these shows, we can remember similar incidents in our own lives," he  said. "We all have those stories. It's just a matter of knowing how to find  them."  </P> <P> Sunday's event is one more example of the increasing interest in storytelling,  Liebermann said. He pointed to the phenomenal growth of the National Assn. for  the Preservation and Perpetuation of Storytelling in Jonesboro, Tenn., as proof  that the oral tradition is thriving.  </P> <P> Seventeen years ago, Jimmy Neil Smith, intent on keeping the art form alive,  started a storytelling festival in Jonesboro. Back then, fewer than 100 people  attended the event, but it still became an annual tradition. At the 1989  festival several weeks ago, 5,500 people showed up.  </P> <P> Fran Cammel, the coordinator of The University of Judaism's Jewish Storytelling  Festival, also sees increased interest in storytelling. A librarian at  Whittmann Elementary School in Cerritos, Cammel has been instrumental in  organizing storytelling events over the past three years in the ABC Unified  School District in Cerritos. This year's festival attendance was 650, up 350  from last year, Cammel said.  </P> <P> "The schools see it as a tool to improve kids' listening skills, their memories  and sequencing skills," she said. "When I teach children to tell stories, I see  a great increase in their self-esteem. They're able to get up in front of a  group, without being afraid. It gives them more confidence."  </P> <P> Yet another sign of storytelling's popularity: IBM, in association with Good  Housekeeping Magazine, is sponsoring a storytelling contest titled "Tell Me a  Story Celebration." Liebermann said 160,000 entry kits will be distributed to  public elementary schools nationwide to encourage youngsters to practice  storytelling.  </P> <P> "There's this celebration of American folklore going on all over the place,"  Liebermann said. "Storytelling is a celebration of being alive."  </P> <P> Although Sunday's festival will focus on Jewish storytelling, Buell and  Liebermann agree that people of any nationality, religion or ethnic background  can understand and enjoy the stories. "People are people, no matter if they're  Jews, Italians, blacks or Eskimos," Liebermann said. "As human beings, we all  go through a similar passage" in life.  </P> <P> Certain elements distinguish Jewish stories, which focus on characters that are  Jewish in nature, such as a rabbi. Common elements from Jewish culture -- like  gefilte fish, kosher foods and Hannukah -- often also are mentioned.  </P> <P> Storytellers are dedicated to keeping Judaism alive, Buell said. "When you're  threatened with extinction, you're more interested in preserving your culture."  </P> <P> Certain themes also are repeatedly found in Jewish stories -- money and wealth,  love and marriage, oppression and the struggle of the human spirit to  persevere.  </P> <P> Humor is often a prime component, too. In Buell's solo performance, she plans  to speak about "tree envy" -- a strictly Jewish phenomenon in which Jews  develop envious feelings toward their Christian neighbors because they wish  that they could have Christmas trees, too. In one humorous anecdote, Buell  relates the story of her Jewish neighbor who insisted on getting her own  Christmas tree; when a rabbi moved next door, the neighbor had to deal with his  unorthodox reaction to her desire to practice a Christian tradition.  </P> <P> Buell also has written some Jewish Christmas carols that she will perform.  </P> <P> "To be a success, the storyteller must get the audience involved," Buell  explained. "When you've really connected on an emotional level and you see  tears in the eyes of the audience -- that's a storyteller's reward."  </P> <P> A Jewish Storytelling Festival will be from 9 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Sunday at The  University of Judaism, 15600 Mulholland Drive. Tickets are $50 per person, $25  for students and senior citizens 65 and older. Registration will be accepted at  the door. For information, call (213) 476-9777.  </P></p>

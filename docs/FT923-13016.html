			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / Bosnia seeks removal of all heavy weapons: London peace talks THE Bosnian government yesterday asked the European Community to place all heavy weapons under international supervision as the first step towards stopping the fighting in Bosnia-Hercegovina. Mr Haris Silajdzic, Bosnia's foreign minister, who took part in bilateral talks with Lord Carrington, chairman of the EC-sponsored peace conference on Yugoslavia, in London said ceasefires were meaningless if the international community failed to take steps to disarm the Serbs. 'How can we continue this peace conference when thousands of people are being killed or deported, and regions are being ethnically cleansed by the Serbs?' asked Mr Silajdzic. He said the Bosnian government would reject the 'cantonisation' plan drawn up by the EC last March. The plan was supported by Mr Radovan Karadzic, head of the Bosnian Serbs, and Mr Mate Boban, head of Bosnia's Croats, because it would eventually lead to the ethnic division of Bosnia between Croatia and Serbia and leave the Moslems without a homeland. Mr Karadzic, leader of Bosnia's Serbs and the Serb irregular forces, who also met Lord Carrington, called for a ceasefire and the creation of a land corridor from the Adriatic port of Split in Croatia to the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo, which is still under siege by the Serb irregulars. Mr Karadzic said the ceasefire 'should last longer to give us a breather to finish our talks on the conference on Bosnia-Hercegovina.' But it appeared unlikely that he would adhere to any ceasefire until the Serbs had consolidated their hold over eastern Bosnia. Meanwhile, Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, who left for a four-day tour of former Yugoslavia, was due to stop in Paris last night for talks with his French opposite number, Mr Roland Dumas. Mr Hurd, who is due to visit Ljubljana, Zagreb, Sarajevo (if conditions permit), Belgrade, Skopje and Tirana, is anxious to use the British presidency of the European Community to boost efforts to find a peaceful solution to the Yugoslav crisis. Mr Hurd and Mr Dumas were expected to discuss the possibility of opening land corridors to Sarajevo through which aid would be transported in trucks, which would have to be protected both by military aircraft and ground troops. Britain has firmly ruled out the use of British troops for such a purpose.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Charles Miller, PRESS ASSOCIATION defence correspondent] </F>   [Text] The 32 billion pound sterling Eurofighter was  unveiled today as the world's most advanced fighter took to the  skies.    Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind called it "a small step in  the history of military aviation" as the four European partners  paraded their dream before senior figures from potential future  customers.    Officials from Saudi Arabia, Japan and Malaysia watched  Eurofighter's impressive international public debut alongside  existing customers at the opening ceremony at British  Aerospace's Warton site in Lancashire.    About 1,500 leading figures in the aerospace industry saw  the  unveiling of the aircraft which is developed jointly by Britain  (33 percent), Germany (33 percent), Italy (21 percent) and Spain  (13 percent).    The Eurofighter will eventually replace the RAF's [Royal Air  Force] Jaguars, Tornado F3s and defunct Phantoms and will be the  most advanced fighter in the world apart from the American F-22,  which will be several years later entering service and twice as  expensive.    The project is also crucially important for the aviation  industries of the four countries as it is sustaining a total of  150,000 jobs. "It is a major part of our industry priority and  offers hope of employment for many tens of thousands of people  along the length and breadth of the UK," said Mr Rifkind.    ``We are all privileged today to be taking part in a small  step in the history of military aviation and to see a little bit  of history being born before our eyes. It is always a romantic  and remarkable event when a new aircraft takes to the sky and  pushes forward yet further the boundaries of aviation  technology.''    As defence budgets tumble in Europe, the four industrial  partners are looking for multi-billion pound sales elsewhere,  particularly the Middle East and Far East, in the early part of  the next century. But Eurofighter's primary role will be to  defend the skies of Europe for the first 30 years of the next  century.    However, the partner nations today warned industry to check  the soaring costs of the project, with German state secretary of  defence Joerg Schoenbohm saying no extra funds were available.  "It is a particular desire of the German defence minister to  lower the costs of this project," he said.    Mr Schoenbohm said Germany would not decide until next year  whether to go ahead and buy the aircraft. The German defence  minister Volker Ruehe, who two years ago almost pulled Germany  out of the project, was noticeable by his absence at the  unveiling.    Spanish armaments director Juan Arenas said the project  represented a "very high cost" and they had to be very careful  about every peseta invested. "We cannot allow ourselves to  spend more than our national economies are able to afford. You  must always keep this in mind."    Mr Rifkind added: "We all have interest in bringing down  costs in a sensible way."</p>

			<p><P> January 31, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 1989 COLLEGE BASEBALL PREVIEWS;  </P> <P> CAL STATE FULLERTON MAKES OPENING BID WITHOUT ITS ACE  </P> <P> It is opening day for the Cal State Fullerton baseball team, but it will not be  quite the way it was imagined.  </P> <P> Cal State Fullerton was to start this season with a preseason All-American  battery -- Mark Beck to throw the first pitch and Brent Mayne to catch it --  but it won't be that way today.  </P> <P> Instead, Danny DeVille, a right-hander who went 7-1 last season, will be the  opening-day pitcher when Fullerton takes on Chapman today at 2:30 at Titan  Field. Word came last week that the shoulder trouble that caused Beck to  withdraw from competition for the U.S. Olympic team also would force him to  undergo surgery and sit out this season.  </P> <P> It was news that threw some uncertainty into the Titans' prospects. When both  college baseball polls ranked Fullerton in the preseason top 10, it was done  partly in recognition of the Titans' play in the College World Series last  season and partly in anticipation of this season's team, which was to be led by  Beck.  </P> <P> For Fullerton Coach Larry Cochell, now in his second season, one question has  replaced another.  </P> <P> Instead of being asked whether he can replace former coach Augie Garrido, now  he's being asked if someone can replace Beck.  </P> <P> By the time Fullerton went 43-18 and finished third in the College World Series  last season and Cochell was named the national coach of the year, the Garrido  question seemed sufficiently answered. Now this one.  </P> <P> "It's hard to lose a player of his caliber," Cochell said. "But we feel  confident someone else can step in."  </P> <P> Cochell said he still thinks the pitching staff is his team's strength.  </P> <P> The Titans knew they had lost one starting pitcher in Longo Garcia, whose  eligibility expired. With the loss of Beck, who struck out a team-record 162  last season, they turn to DeVille, a consistent senior who had a 3.27  earned-run average last year. Huck Flener, a left-hander who was 4-1 with a  3.86 ERA last season as a freshman, is the second starter. With Beck out, Paul  Johnson, a right-hander who worked as a reliever last season, becomes a  starter. Sophomore Matt Watson and Sam Colarusso, a transfer from Orange Coast  College, could break into the rotation.  </P> <P> Chris Robinson, Rich Faulks and freshman James Popoff are the long and middle  relievers, with Erik Silvey and Golden West College transfer Kenneth Hokuf the  short relievers.  </P> <P> "We still feel good about our pitching staff," Cochell said.  </P> <P> Handling that staff is Mayne, the steady hand who put together a school- and  conference-record 38-game hitting streak last season while batting .393. His  defense is as steady as his hitting, and with the addition of 20 pounds, he  should be the backbone of this team. Freshman Eddie Lample will be the backup.  </P> <P> Despite losing 35 home runs with the departure of first baseman Keith Kaub and  second basemen Mike Ross, the Titans will be a good offensive team.  </P> <P> David Staton, a first baseman/designated hitter who transferred from Orange  Coast College, will try to replace some of that power.  </P> <P> "We feel good about Staton," Cochell said.  </P> <P> Cochell said a sore back muscle will keep Staton out of the lineup for the  first week.  </P> <P> Rex Peters, a senior whom Cochell calls "probably the best defensive first  baseman he has coached," will play first base and outfield.  </P> <P> Ralph Ramirez returns at third base, with Saddleback College transfer Bill  Lasher competing for time.  </P> <P> In Cochell's mind, the question about this team is its defense up the middle,  where last year's double-play duo of Ross and Mark Razook is falling to the  hands of a freshman and a sophomore.  </P> <P> Mate Borgagno, a left-handed-hitting sophomore from Chino Hills who transferred  from Nebraska, has laid claim to second base, and freshman Randy Graves from  Riverside Poly High School is starting today at shortstop. Graves is in a  battle with John Paboojian, a transfer from Mt. San Antonio College.  </P> <P> In the outfield, Rich Gonzales, a transfer from Rancho Santiago whom Cochell  calls "an outstanding hitter," will be in left, with returning player Bobby  Jones in center. In right, left-hander Trevor Neighbors and Rod Klopfer from  Fullerton are likely to platoon. Paul Bunch from Cypress College also will play  in right.  </P> <P> "We're ready to get going," Cochell said.  </P></p>

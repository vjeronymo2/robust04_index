			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / Apple looks to Newton's law: The computer maker is pinning its hopes for improved earnings on its new product line Apple Computer today launches the Newton MessagePad, the first product of its much ballyhooed efforts to create a multi-billion-dollar market for 'personal digital assistants' combining computer, communications and consumer electronics technologies. The pocket-sized MessagePad can store, send and sort hand-written messages and notes and keep track of appointments. It is almost an electronic secretary. Scrawl 'Call Mary' on the electronic tablet and it will automatically place the call. 'Lunch with Bob, Friday' becomes an entry in your diary at your regular lunch time. Yet, while John Sculley, Apple chairman, is telling customers that Newton will play a central role in the 'digital age', Michael Spindler, who recently replaced Sculley as chief executive, must deal with the less appealing issue of Apple's declining profits. Newton may boost Apple's reputation as top innovator in the computer industry, but it is unlikely to make a big contribution to its earnings. Polishing up Apple's image could prove easier than repairing the company's tarnished earnings record. Last month, Apple reported the worst quarterly results in its 17-year history: net losses of Dollars 188m, after a Dollars 321m pre-tax charge for 2,500 job cuts; operating profits down from Dollars 212m to just Dollars 17m (including interest and other income) on soaring costs; revenues up 7 per cent to Dollars 1.86bn, but short of Wall Street's expectations of about Dollars 2bn. Apple's financial slide has raised serious doubts about whether the company can continue to invest heavily in research and development, the foundation of its success. Sculley's technology vision seems out of synch with harsh economic realities. As Lou Gerstner, IBM chairman, put it bluntly last week when revealing plans for drastic cuts at Big Blue: 'If you are going to have a technology vision, the first frame had better be making money.' Ironically, Apple, the archetypical high-tech start-up company hatched in a Silicon Valley garage by two young technology enthusiasts, now faces problems similar to those of IBM, the established industry giant, albeit on a much smaller scale. Both companies have relied for too long on proprietary technology - IBM with its mainframe computers and Apple with its Macintosh personal computers (PCs) - letting competitors overtake them. Throughout the 1980s, Apple charged premium prices - and maintained high profit margins - because its Macintosh technology gave it an advantage over PC rivals. That advantage has been virtually wiped out in three years by Microsoft's Windows, a program giving Macintosh-like ease-of-use features on all other PCs. With some 30m copies of Windows in use, it has become the standard operating system for PCs, the preference of corporate buyers and the platform favoured by developers of PC applications programs. Forced to compete head to head with other PC makers, Apple launched a bold but risky bid, in late 1990, to increase its share of the PC market by lowering prices. For a time, the strategy seemed to pay off. Apple's share of the world market rose from about 8 per cent in 1990 to 12 per cent by the end of last year. But there it has stayed, despite continuing price cuts. Apple may have stretched the Macintosh market to its limit. 'The Apple Macintosh appeals to a certain type of customer,' says Amy Wohl, an industry consultant and long-time Apple watcher. 'Dropping prices does not expand the scope of Apple's market very much.' Wohl says Apple missed its chance in the mid-1980s to establish its unique Macintosh software as an industry standard. If Apple had licensed its software to other computer makers, before Windows took off, the company might be the market leader today, she suggests. Instead, the technology that Apple once called its 'crown jewels' now weighs heavily. Macintosh is not compatible with other PCs, so Apple has been limited to a narrow market segment while competitors have met the broader demand for standards-based PCs. There have also been tactical errors. Apple began the financial year starting last September with a huge backlog of orders for the latest versions of its Macintosh PCs, but was unable to fulfil demand throughout the first half of the fiscal year. While competitors were lowering their prices, Apple held back until recently, not wanting to undercut the price of products which customers were waiting for. When Apple was finally able to increase production to meet back orders, the company found many buyers had purchased competitors' PCs at lower prices. Another factor affecting Macintosh sales is uncertainty surrounding future products. Next year, Apple plans to launch a range of computers based on PowerPC, a more powerful microprocessor technology developed in partnership with IBM and Motorola, the second-largest US microchip maker. Although Apple has assured software developers that their products will run on PowerPC computers, potential Apple customers fear that, when they buy a Macintosh, it may be the last in the line. Sculley is taking much of the blame for Apple's predicament. Critics charge he spent too much time exploring new technology and not enough on Apple's core PC business. However, Spindler, in his previous role as chief operating officer, was the steward of Apple's PC business long before his promotion to chief executive in mid-June. Handing off the chief executive post to Spindler was 'a non-event', Sculley said, because it merely made official a division of powers that had been in place, with Sculley immersing himself in creating opportunities for Apple and Spindler running daily operations. The question now is whether Spindler 'is the problem, or part of the solution', says David Coursey, editor of PC Letter, an industry newsletter. But Spindler's appointment has won praise from financial analysts. An Apple veteran who began as marketing manager for European operations 13 years ago, Spindler is the kind of 'hard-nosed operations guy' Apple needs at its helm, they say. Colleagues call him a 'superb manager'. Certainly, Spindler has lost no time getting to grips with Apple's financial problems. Less than three weeks after his promotion to chief executive, he announced a restructuring of the company. 'We must significantly - and permanently - lower our cost of doing business,' he told employees last month. In the past two weeks, Apple has laid off 2,100 workers and announced a further 400 job cuts, reducing the company's workforce by almost 16 per cent to 12,500. Spindler also announced moves to consolidate Apple's eight divisions into five business units, giving each more responsibility for profitability. The changes will eliminate duplicate functions, Apple says. The effect of the cuts on Apple's prized R&amp;D teams has yet to be felt, but industry observers predict that some of the company's long-term projects will fall victim to budget constraints. Much may depend upon the success of the Newton MessagePad. If it is a winner, Spindler may be more inclined to continue investments in 'personal digital assistants'. However, observers predict modest sales of perhaps Dollars 50m over the next 12 months - not enough to have much impact on Apple's earnings fall. Though the company has narrowed its target market primarily to business people who spend a lot of time out of the office, Newton MessagePad could mark a turning point. Like the first Macintosh PC, introduced nine years ago, it could be the first of many products that will influence technological innovation for years. However, Sculley's brainchild is far from perfect: it lacks effective 'wireless communications', as originally planned, and critics charge that its 3in-by-4in screen is too small to take more than a few words. At Dollars 700-Dollars 1,300 it is also expensive - and might end up as no more than an executive toy. Nonetheless Newton represents Sculley's ambition once again to storm the technological high ground. 'For Apple to remain an exciting company, we have to move beyond the personal computer,' Sculley said recently. 'Otherwise, we will still be around in a few years, but nobody will care.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Network Africa" program] </F>   [Text] Angola -- where the war seems to have reached a new  intensity as rebel UNITA [National Union for the Total  Independence of Angola] forces scale up their military  offensive. At present, this offensive seems to be centered on  the government-held southern [as heard] city of Kuito, which is  surrounded by UNITA forces. But to try and get a clearer picture  of what's happening throughout the country, Emily Kasrils called  the deputy foreign minister of the ruling MPLA [Popular Movement  for the Liberation of Angola] government, Jorge Chikoty. On the  line to Luanda last night, she started by asking him about the  latest situation in Kuito:    [Begin recording] [Chikoty] Well, the latest situation we  have on Kuito is very, very bad. There are about six UNITA  divisions that have been shelling the city of Kuito for the past  few weeks [indistinct words] as many as eight people dead and 20  people wounded including a number of children. There is still a  lot of fighting around the city of Kuito, and we are rather  concerned about this situation. We think that UNITA's strategy  is to take over the city of Kuito before major steps in the  negotiations taking place in Lusaka are (?taken).    [Kasrils] There also appears to be fighting in the oil  enclave of Cabinda, where UNITA has reportedly made an alliance  with the FLEC [Front for the Liberation of the Cabinda Enclave]  group. Now, this is going to have serious implications for your  funding of your military campaign in Angola, isn't it?    [Chikoty] No. What I think is that in Cabinda we do not have  major military movements from UNITA, but we know that there is  in fact some kind of a link between UNITA and the FLEC-FAC  [Cabinda Armed Forces], which is quite an old alliance. But we  do not think that UNITA has the capacity of taking over the  (?fields) of Cabinda.    [Kasrils] But most of your revenue that you are using to  fight the war with UNITA is derived from Cabinda and, therefore,  anything that happens to those oil fields will have implications  to your ability to fight.    [Chikoty] Oil plays an important part in our budget for  everything -- not only for the war, but also for all the other  social and economic responsibilities that the government has.  We are not surprised. This is not a new tendency in the  Angolan war, but what we can say is that we do not think that  UNITA has this capacity of taking over Cabinda. We are also  hoping that there will be peace. The government's global  strategy is not to go on fighting, but is to find a negotiable  solution to the Angolan crisis. That is why we have been  negotiating for eight months with UNITA.    [Kasrils] But if things carry on like they are doing at the  moment, it is just going to be that the killing is going to  continue. The talks in Lusaka haven't reached any conclusion  after eight months, and the people in Angola are going to  continue dying because neither of you are able to come to an  agreement.    [Chikoty] We are saying is that UNITA is fighting for no  reason. What I am trying to tell you is that UNITA has got to  stop fighting against the legitimate government. What would you  expect from us? Do you want us to abdicate from our  responsibilities? It's not the government that has gone into  fighting. It's UNITA that went into fighting. So, you cannot  put UNITA and the government on the same table -- I mean on the  same level. [end recording]</p>

			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Gatt sets up panel on cassette tape dispute THE General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade world trade body yesterday set up a dispute panel to investigate a Japanese complaint against duties imposed by the European Community on imported audio cassette tapes, trade sources said, Reuter reports from Geneva. The decision was taken at a closed-door meeting of the Gatt anti-dumping committee. The two trading partners agreed to neutral arbitration on the nearly 18-month row after the committee chairman, Mr Armando Ortega of Mexico, held mediation talks this week. Canada, the US and Hong Kong told the 25-nation committee that they had a 'trade interest' in the matter and would submit their own data to the panel. In May 1991 the EC, charging that the cassettes were being dumped, or sold at artificially low prices, imposed duties of 15 to 25 per cent on tapes imported from Japan. Tokyo says the duties violate Gatt's 1979 anti-dumping code. According to Tokyo figures, Japanese producers' share of tapes sold in the EC market dropped to 35.1 per cent in 1988 from 41.9 per cent in 1985. In 1985, EC-made tapes' EC market share was 27.4 per cent, falling to 19.6 per cent in 1988.</p>

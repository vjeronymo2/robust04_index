			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / Arts: A frosty outlook - Radio Not very seasonal, I'm afraid, but a phrase that has resonated through the week referred to 'the extraordinary resilience of bad ideas . . . They come round year by year'. Thus did the excellent Radio 4 series Scapegoats leave us with the gloomy prognosis that, when it comes to the Pharisee thanking God he was not as other men, human nature is condemned to 'relive the same old mistakes'. Tchaikovsky understood. Radio 3's Pride or Prejudice? trotted out the now familiar theory that the composer was forced to commit suicide by a kangaroo court of his academic colleagues, worried that his homosexuality might shame the old school. The proponent of this theory compared it with a Russian version of Eton. An opponent said nothing of the sort, the school produced several reprobates and disreputables, some of whom were homosexual. As an argument against the Eton comparison this seemed a trifle sanguine. The forced suicide idea strikes me as far-fetched but the incidentals were fascinating: the Russian press came out in favour of Oscar Wilde during his disgrace, the male companion of Tsar Alexander III's brother was referred to as his 'mistress' by the blase Parisian press. The programme's presenter, Stephen Johnson, wondered whether the phenomenon even aroused disapproval - rather naively; whatever the attitudes among the enlightened or the privileged, or even the lawmakers at any particular time, homosexuality has never been accepted by Christendom. Which was why Mum, I've Got Something to Tell You (Radio 4) was so engrossing. Three young men, with contributions from their families, recalled coming out as gay to their parents. The mother of a Jewish violinist from a supportive East End family remembered: 'We all cried together and cuddled together.' A Mancunian student told his dad when he came back from snooker. 'He said, well, there it is, and took the dog for a walk.' Mother added that he was a long time: 'I'm sure the dog's legs were much shorter afterwards.' Their worlds did not fall in. Only with the Roman Catholic from Belfast was there a hint of bitterness. Goaded into telling his parents, ironically, by anger at the unsympathetic priest, he betrayed a certain bitterness at his family's attitude. 'They don't ask me how my partner is. It hurts a little bit. Sometimes I think, why did I tell them?' This programme was funny, touching and oddly reassuring. Taking the dog for a walk is a civilised response to familial upheavals. Radio has a gentle, unhectoring way of insidiously introducing slightly dotty strangers into your home. In Radio 4's Personal Obsessions I suddenly became aware of a collector of old gramophones verging on the quietly fanatic as he spoke of the survival of chocolate records, played with a glass stylus. 'The sound quality's not brilliant,' he said wistfully. Unless I imagined it all. On Sunday Radio 3 went magnificently to town, many towns, several countries, for a 15-hour musical jaunt around Europe. The odd technical hitch (notably in the charmingly secular-sounding Anfossi, into whose operas Mozart interpolated arias, cut off from Italy) is pardonable; less so sloppy editing of a reading by Robert Hardy. But there were fine things here, from Finland to Israel. I suppose it was salutary to hear the modern Russian composer Schnittke's variations on 'Silent night' on Radio 3's On Air. Sour, jagged, dissonant, as spiky as barbed wire, they reminded us that the frost is no less sharp, the wind no less bitter on those turned away from the inn, and their numbers grow no less; just as bad ideas come round year after year and mankind relives the same old mistakes.</p>

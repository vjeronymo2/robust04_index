			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / International Equity Issues: Large deals line up from South-East Asia region The flood of equity-linked international offerings from South-East Asian companies shows no sign of abating, with large deals lined up from Indonesia and Thailand. Indofoods, Indonesia's largest food company which dominates the Indonesian instant noodle market, is planning to launch an international equity or equity-linked offerings for a total of up to Dollars 800m this spring, investment bankers said. UBS has won the mandate for the deal. Meanwhile, Bangkok Bank, Thailand's largest bank, launched a Dollars 400m 10-year convertible Eurobond issue earlier this week which is due to be priced later this month. Aokam Perdana, the Malaysian timber company, is planning a Dollars 125m, 10-year convertible Eurobond issue, which will raise money to refinance its existing borrowings as well as providing new funds. Details of the issue have not been finalised. Jardine Fleming has been appointed lead manager. While there have been plenty of Thai convertible Eurobonds in recent months, few Malaysian companies have taken the opportunity to launch such issues. Asian equity specialists point out that this partly reflects the quite favourable financing opportunities in the domestic market. Aokam was quoted on AP-Dow Jones saying the issue will allow it 'to access the currently favourable market for Asian Euro-convertibles and to diversify its funding sources'.</p>

			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / Technology: Neural network fills gap Next week the government publishes a survey which was put together using one of the biggest neural network systems - a computing technique loosely based on the workings of the brain - yet developed. The Department of Social Security has spent Pounds 400,000 on a neural system to help prepare the DSS's Family Resources Survey, an exercise based on interviews with 25,000 households which helps forecast and model benefit expenditure. The system, which uses 1,500 individual neural networks, is the largest in Europe, according to Recognition Systems, its Birmingham-based developer. The DSS statisticians turned to neural networks to fill in gaps in their data, where interviewees had failed to answer particular questions. Filling these gaps is important because bias would be introduced into the survey if the questionnaires were left incomplete. Although the adoption of neural networks in government surveys had few precedents, their potential was obvious. Neural networks, which are trained by example, can pick out patterns in large amounts of data. The results of a pilot study were encouraging. It suggested that neural computing technology was up to 40 per cent more accurate in estimating the missing data items than classical statistical techniques such as regression analysis. The neural network proved capable of imputing results for 70 per cent of the 45,000 items that were missing from the survey's database, which totalled 10m items. There were insufficient examples of the other 30 per cent of items, which involved unusual situations, for the neural network to handle. The system has won the enthusiasm of Cheryl Morgan, the Family Resources Survey's statistician. Not only does it produce more accurate results than conventional techniques, but it costs less to run, she says.</p>

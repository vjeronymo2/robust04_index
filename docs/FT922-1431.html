			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Poddington ex-chief jailed for two years A FORMER chairman of Poddington, a company that promoted the Poddington Peas cartoon characters, was sentenced to two years in jail yesterday for rigging the market in the company's shares. An Old Bailey judge said that companies controlled by Mr Leonard Lee made massive disguised purchases of Poddington shares, creating a false impression in the market that there was far more genuine dealing in the stock than had been the case. The main losers were Barclays Bank and a number of firms of stockbrokers and marketmakers, which between them lost about Pounds 3.4m. Sentencing Mr Lee, who admitted an offence under section 47 of the Financial Services Act, Judge Bruce Laughland QC told him: 'You were quite cynical in this operation. It was carried out repetitively over a period of time. You exploited your high reputation in the City and damaged the firms who trusted you.' Mr David Cocks QC, prosecuting, said Poddington had been brought on to the third market in 1989 by Cleves Investments, which had been Mr Lee's 'creature'. Mr Lee had then 'ramped' Poddington shares, artificially boosting their market value by dealing in the stock though his own companies. He had traded extensively on credit, rolling over his liabilities and disguising from marketmakers and brokers his own massive holdings. He had built up on credit a holding of two thirds of the issued Poddington shares, in part by deceiving the market that there was genuine interest by institutional and other buyers, when in fact it had resulted from manipulation by Mr Lee through his own companies, Mr Cocks said. Judge Laughland said Mr Lee's own companies had gone into the market and purchased Poddington shares to support the price. When he and his companies no longer had the resources to finance the purchases he resorted to techniques known as 'cashing and newing' and 'selling and buying new time' to defer payment. Barclays Bank had 'surprisingly' increased Mr Lee's borrowing facility from Pounds 500,000 to Pounds 1.6m - 'I say surprisingly because the advance was made on a market which had already substantially fallen.' The judge said that, in considering the losses Mr Lee had caused, he took into account in Mr Lee's favour the fact that Barclays had to an extent brought its loss on itself. There had then been a sequence of rollovers from stockbrokers and others, enabling Poddington shares either to be sold and bought again at the same or at an enhanced price, together with commission and any premium or other financial advantage to the stockbrokers. 'I am prepared to assume in your favour,' the judge told Mr Lee, 'though not against them, that they either connived at the kind of manipulation in which you were engaged or were naive or negligent about the way in which this kind of deferment of payment was made possible by the facilities they provided.'</p>

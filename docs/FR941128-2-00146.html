D&hyph;9539 through D&hyph;9544]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed Exemption  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department is considering granting an exemption under the authority of section 408(a) of the Act and section 4975(c)(2) of the Code and in accordance with the procedures set forth in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 29 CFR Part 2570, Subpart B (55 FR 32836, 32847, August 10, 1990). If the exemption is granted, the restrictions of sections 406(a), 406(b)(1) and (b)(2) of the Act and the sanctions resulting from the application of section 4975 of the Code, by reason of section 4975(c)(1) (A) through (E) of the Code, shall not apply, effective January 17, 1992, to fifteen past sales and purchases by the Trust of twelve issues of short-term commercial paper (the CNA Transactions), as identified below, involving the Continental Casualty Company, the Continental Assurance Company, the Continental Assurance Company Guaranteed Investment Fund, the Valley Forge Life Insurance Company, Valley Forge Insurance Company, and the American Casualty Company of Reading, Pennsylvania (collectively, the CNA Companies), each of which is a party in interest with respect to the CNA Employees' Retirement Plan (the Plan), whose assets are held by the Trust; provided that the following conditions are satisfied:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) In each of the CNA Transactions, the Trust paid no more, or received no less, than the fair market value of the commercial paper involved in the transaction;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) The CNA Transactions constituted, in the aggregate, less than four percent of all commercial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paper transactions of the Trust during 1992; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) The CNA Companies have undertaken efforts to prevent any recurrence of direct or indirect transactions involving the Trust and the CNA Companies, including the appointment of an independent investment manager of all the Trust's commercial paper investments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Summary of Facts and Representations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. The Plan is a defined contribution pension plan sponsored by CNA Financial Corporation (CNAF), an Illinois public corporation, 83 percent of the stock of which is owned by Loews Corporation. CNAF's largest wholly-owned subsidiary is the Continental Casualty Company (Casualty), one of the largest property-casualty insurance underwriters in the United States. Among Casualty's eleven insurance subsidiaries (collectively, the CNA Companies) are the Continental Assurance Company (Assurance) and the American Casualty Company of Reading, Pennsylvania (ACCP). Valley Forge Life Insurance Company (VF Life) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Assurance, and Valley Forge Insurance Company (VF Insurance) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of ACCP. Assurance is a registered investment advisor under the Investment Advisors Act of 1940, as amended. The Plan had 19,858 participants as of December 31, 1992, and total assets of approximately $443 million as of June 30, 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Prior to January 2, 1992, the Plan's assets had been invested by Assurance, as Plan fiduciary, through a variety of separate accounts, and in a participating investment contract issued by Assurance. Effective January 1, 1992, all of the Plan's investment contracts and separate accounts were canceled and terminated, and the liquidated assets were transferred to the CNA Employees' Retirement Trust (the Trust). Simultaneously, CNAF entered into a contract with Assurance (the Advisory Agreement), effective January 1, 1992, under which Assurance agreed to provide investment advice to the Trust. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Among other things, Assurance agreed to supervise the composition of the Trust's portfolio continuously, and to determine the nature and timing of changes in the portfolio and the manner of effectuating such changes, subject to the oversight of the Trust's trustees. Assurance's responsibilities under the Advisory Agreement include the provision of advice, information and recommendations with respect to acquisition, holding and disposition of securities by the Trust. During 1992, two individuals who were employed by Assurance and Casualty (the Traders) had investment discretion over commercial paper transactions of the Trust, Casualty, and the other CNA Companies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Applicants represent that the Trust does not pay any fees to Assurance with respect to services rendered pursuant to the Advisory Agreement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 3. The Applicants represent that as part of an internal compliance program, Casualty's employee benefits planning staff developed a systems program designed to detect related-party transactions involving the Trust. A trial run of that program on May 6, 1993 detected that certain Trust transactions involved commercial paper which was purchased by CNA Companies. Upon this discovery, further investigations were conducted by Casualty's legal staff in June 1993 to determine whether any more of the Trust's commercial paper transactions involved CNA Companies. As a result of these voluntary investigative efforts, Casualty has determined that fifteen of the commercial paper transactions engaged in by the Trust between January 17 and December 10, 1992 involved five of the CNA Companies (the CNA Transactions). In response to the discovery of these transactions, the five CNA Companies involved (the Applicants) are requesting an exemption for the CNA Transactions under the terms and conditions described herein.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. The CNA Transactions fall into four categories: (a) Direct Trust sales, which are direct sales by the Trust of commercial paper to a CNA Company; (b) Indirect Trust sales through the issuer, which are sales by the Trust of commercial paper to the issuer of the commercial paper, and the purchase by CNA Companies, on the same date and from the same issuer, of commercial paper issued by that same issuer with the same maturity date; (c) Indirect Trust sales through dealers, which are sales by the Trust of commercial paper to independent broker-dealers, and the purchase by CNA Companies on the same date from the same broker-dealers of commercial paper of the same issuer and with the same maturity date; and (d) Indirect Trust purchases through dealers, which are sales by CNA Companies of commercial paper to independent broker-dealers, and the purchase by the Trust on the same date from the same broker-dealers of commercial paper of the same issuer and with the same maturity date. The Applicants describe the details of the CNA Transactions as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Direct Trust sales:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) On November 2, 1992, the Trust sold Ameritech Capital Funding commercial paper with a maturity date of November 13, 1992, principal amount $17,575,000, to Casualty for $17,558,245.17.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) On November 2, 1992, the Trust sold Woolworth Corporation commercial paper with a maturity date of November 13, 1992, principal amount $17,950,000, to Casualty for $17,928,011.25. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Applicants represent that the sale prices in both of the direct Trust sales were determined by contemporaneous independent price quotes for the commercial paper from dealers in such paper. The Applicants further represent that due to an irregularity in the U.S. commercial paper market on the day of the transactions, the Trust's representative, Mr. Wayne Gulgren, succeeded in obtaining prices for the Ameritech Capital Funding and Woolworth Corporation commercial paper on November 2, 1992, which were actually more favorable to the Trust than the Trust could have obtained through dealers in the open market.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

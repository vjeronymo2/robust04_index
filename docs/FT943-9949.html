			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / Emerging Markets: News round-up Bangkok Thailand's Securities and Exchange Commission has agreed in principle to allow Thai securities companies to open offices abroad, the SEC announced in Bangkok, writes Victor Mallet. Among the first candidates are likely to be Securities One, the independent broker which has said it wants a regional presence, and Phatra Thanakit, which has dominated the Thai underwriting market. Bombay The Securities and Exchange Board of India has announced the rules on the preferential allotment of shares and warrants convertible into shares, Reuter reports. The SEBI's announcement is a response to the severe criticism it faced after permitting some 30 leading multinationals to raise stakes in their Indian units by allotting themselves shares at steep discounts. The prefer-ential allotment method was also used by promoters of more than a dozen Indian companies to acquire shares cheaply. According to SEBI's rules, promoters have an option of pricing the allotment on the basis of the average share price in the past six months or the past two weeks. Budapest Turnover on the stock exchange rose to Ft18.01bn in July, a rise of more than 60 per cent from June. Share turnover rose to Ft2.8bn from Ft2.2bn in June, while bond turnover more than doubled to Ft7.8bn from Ft3.6bn a month before. The number of securities introduced to the bourse rose to 104 in July, from 93 in June. Moscow Russia is to hold an auction for Rbs600bn worth of six-month Treasury bills on August 9, officials at the Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange have said, Reuter reports. Investors still consider T-bills an attractive instrument, but interest in the paper started fading as T-bill yields fell in line with lower interbank credit rates and a decline in monthly inflation.

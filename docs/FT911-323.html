			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / UK Company News: CRS hits Pounds 45m and lifts market share CO-OPERATIVE Retail Services achieved a 14 per cent increase in trading surplus to Pounds 44.9m for the year to January 26, despite depressed conditions in its sector. Mr Harry Moore, chief executive of the UK's largest retail co-operative society, added that CRS had taken market share from competitors as net sales moved ahead by 11 per cent to Pounds 1.29bn (Pounds 1.16bn). In particular, he highlighted the performance of the non-food division where sales had risen by 14 per cent to Pounds 191m and trading surplus by 34 per cent. Home furnishing and electrical goods had especially defied national trends. Mr Moore thought the non-food division, which aimed to sell middle-market products, had benefited during the recession as customers focused on achieving value for money. On the non-food side, CRS claimed it was the UK's fifth largest department store operator with 49 shops, many of which have adopted the Living format, and 11 specialised stores including five Homeworld outlets. However, the society's dominant activity is in food retailing, where it claims at least 3.5 per cent of the UK grocery market with 480 outlets. These include about 100 Leo's out-of-town superstores as well as the more traditional Stop &amp; Shop corner shops. Both have a strong emphasis on price. Purchase of the Cambridge Society last October helped boost sales of the division which rose by 12.5 per cent to Pounds 944m. On a like-for-like basis, they would have increased by nearly 11 per cent. There was a 13.5 per cent rise in trading surplus. The inclusion of Cambridge's borrowings was a factor behind a sharp increase in CRS's net interest payments to Pounds 14.31m (Pounds 10.04m). Operating surplus, struck after payments of interest on CRS's shares and grants and donations, fell to Pounds 19.91m (Pounds 20.04m). The retained surplus was Pounds 22.61m (Pounds 23.35m). A change in CRS's constitution later this month will alter substantially its relationship with the Co-operative Wholesale Society. This follows the abandonment of merger talks last summer.</p>

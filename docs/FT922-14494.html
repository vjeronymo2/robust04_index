			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / Leading Article: Tenants squeezed A GROWING number of tenants in England, among them companies both large and small, is falling foul of a law governing the assignment of leases on properties. During the recession the law is causing arbitrary injustice which ought to be remedied by the next government. Under English, but not Scottish, law a tenant can be held liable for unpaid rent owed by any subsequent tenant to whom the lease is assigned. In more prosperous times this caused few difficulties because tenants were generally able to keep up rental payments and landlords could easily find new tenants. Now, the recession in the UK property market has made it easier for tenants to negotiate a rent 'holiday' or leases shorter than the standard 25 years. But it has also pushed more and more businesses into difficulty, and landlords have increasingly enforced the liability clause. For example, a retired grocery shop owner received a demand for more than Pounds 50,000 six years after selling his business. A larger company which leased offices in central London between 1985 and 1987 at a rent of Pounds 355,000 a year was faced with a claim of Pounds 800,000. The institutions which invest in property argue that 25-year leases and assignors' liability clauses are required to guarantee the long-term returns they need to match their long-term obligations. But the absence of this security does not appear to have restrained investors outside England. Many tenants would prefer an adjustment to rent levels to compensate landlords for any reduction in the attractiveness of rented property as an investment. Rents, unlike the liability clauses, are at least subject to market pressures. Little can be done to help tenants now facing demands arising from rent defaults. But a fairer balance needs to be established in future. The next government should look urgently at proposals drawn up in 1988 by the Law Commission. The commission called for tenants' liability to end when they assign a lease to their successors, although in certain circumstances a landlord would be able to seek guarantees for his immediate successor. This might lead to landlords making more frequent use of their right to reject a potential assignee, which could appear to reduce the flexibility of the property market. But 25-year leases with a continuing liability are even more powerful restraints on market flexibility. The demands of fairness and the economic benefits of making the property market more responsive to the needs of tenants both argue for speedy action to change the law.</p>

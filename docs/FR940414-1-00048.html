			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Previously established BPT for pesticide formulating, packaging or repackaging requires zero discharge of process wastewater pollutants. Nevertheless, there are a small number of facilities identified through EPA's survey that do discharge directly to surface waters. Most of these facilities are also manufacturing active ingredients and they combine the wastewater from formulating, packaging or repackaging with the other process wastewater through their wastewater treatment systems. These facilities seek to show compliance with their National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit conditions, which include no allowance for the pollutants present in the formulating or packaging wastewater, by showing that their combined discharge (consisting of both manufacturing and formulating, packaging or repackaging wastewaters) meets the permit limits. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA's survey of the pesticide formulating, packaging or repackaging industry revealed that process wastewater derives primarily from cleaning the process equipment, shipping and raw material containers, the general processing area, laboratory equipment, and safety equipment. Occasionally, formulating, packaging or repackaging facilities will have an air pollution control scrubber, contaminated stormwater (fairly common at refilling establishments), or a heated water bath in which aerosol containers are tested for leaks. Wastewater generated by cleaning the interior of formulating or packaging equipment, bulk storage tanks, or the interior of raw material and shipping containers contains the highest concentrations of active ingredient and product constituents. Since these wastewaters are generated from the cleaning interiors of equipment or containers, they are referred to as ``interior'' cleaning wastewater sources for purposes of this regulation. Wastewater from cleaning the general facility, including floors, the exterior of equipment, and laboratory or safety equipment, DOT aerosol test baths, and air pollution scrubbers will also be contaminated with active ingredients and product, but are likely to be less concentrated and may be contaminated with other pollutants unrelated to the product's constituents. These latter sources of wastewater are referred to as ``non-interior'' cleaning wastewater sources. EPA believes that the interior waste streams will generally be capable of reuse directly without application of wastewater treatment technologies. In contrast, the non-interior waste streams may not be capable of reuse back into the product because of non-product constituents that may be present, but may be reused elsewhere in the facility (e.g., as floor washwater) after treatment to remove or reduce pollutant concentrations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The formulation type of the pesticide products will also have an effect on the wastewater characteristics. For example, some pesticide active ingredients are not very soluble in water, therefore the product may use an organic solvent as a carrier for the active ingredient. Such formulations may contain agents such as surfactants and emulsifiers to aid in keeping the active ingredient in solution when applied. Some pesticide products are produced as a solid. The active ingredient may be a solid or liquid that is sprayed onto a dry substrate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA collected wastewater samples from thirteen PFPR facilities. Eight facilities were sampled over a period of two or three days and numerous wastewater samples were collected. Six of these facilities operated treatment systems which were the focus of the sampling episode. One of the six facilities with treatment was sampled during two distinct episodes. The remaining five facilities were sampled during a one-day site visit. Usually only one sample was collected from these five. EPA concentrated on sampling facilities that are operating wastewater treatment technologies. EPA has also attempted to characterize a variety of different formulation types with as many different active ingredients as possible. Most of the eight facilities sampled over a period of days are formulating and packaging a variety of products containing a number of active ingredients. Therefore, although in many cases all wastewaters may be combined and EPA may not have been able to characterize wastewater from each production batch, a considerable amount of data has been collected on the nature and characteristics of wastewaters generated by formulating, packaging and repackaging facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA has not sampled any wastewater from refilling establishments, however 7 facilities have been visited. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Pollution Prevention, Recycle, Reuse and Water Conservation Practices <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The pesticide formulating, packaging or repackaging facilities employ many pollution prevention, recycle and reuse practices. As described above, wastewater is mainly generated by cleaning the production areas and associated equipment. Throughout the site visiting program, EPA noticed that pollution prevention practices are widely accepted and practiced by the industry. Recycle and reuse practices are evident in addition to other practices which are widely used by facilities in this industry for water conservation or to avoid creating a wastewater source. EPA believes that some or all of these practices can be implemented at all pesticide formulating, packaging, and repackaging facilities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

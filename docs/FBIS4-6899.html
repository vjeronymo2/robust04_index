			<p>BFN     [Text] Malaysia has proposed that Brunei sign an avoidance  of double taxation agreement and an investement guarantee accord  as soon as possible to further enhance bilateral trade. The  proposal was made by its foreign minister, Datuk Abdullah Ahmad  Badawi, in his speech at the first meeting of the  Malaysia-Brunei Joint Commission in Langkawi. He (?noted) ample  potential in stepping up bilateral trade between the two  countries. He said Malaysia is ever ready to encourage its  private sector to share its manpower and financial resources to  ensure the success of development projects and joint ventures  between the two nations.</p>

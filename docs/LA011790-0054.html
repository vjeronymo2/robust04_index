			<p><P> January 17, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INVESTING IN POLITICAL INTEGRITY  </P> <P> Money may not be the root of all evil, but the exaggerated influence it gives  special interests and the corruption it engenders among public officials at all  levels contribute considerably to the anguish of American democracy today.  </P> <P> The magnitude of the campaign-finance crisis is greater than ever before. For  example, according to the nonpartisan California Commission on Campaign  Financing, the amount of money spent to win seats in this state's Legislature  has risen more than 4,000% over the past three decades. This year alone, total  campaign spending in legislative contests may come close to $100 million. The  situation at the federal and municipal levels differs only in absolute size,  not in degree.  </P> <P> In its most basic form -- the good old-fashioned bribe -- political corruption  is universally condemned. There is, after all, a general agreement extending  back to biblical times that the outright exchange of political favors for money  is wrong. But the bribe's polite cousin -- conflict of interest -- is a  slightly shiftier character. Even so, there now is a broadening consensus that  public officials ought not to participate in governmental decisions in which  they have an economic interest.  </P> <P> But dealing with the corrupting or, for that matter, distorting influence of  money which enters government through the perfectly legal avenue of the  campaign-finance system is a complex business. Today's debate in the City  Council over the City of Los Angeles Ethics Act is a textbook example of the  problem. Even though the proposed act incorporates many of the reform  movement's most advanced ideas, the portion of the law dealing with ethical  conduct in office appears far more palatable to many council members than the  proposals dealing with the ethical conduct of politics, the campaign-finance  reform section.  </P> <P> Too bad. Ethical government and ethical politics are inextricably linked. The  most disturbing of the wave of scandals now afflicting American government at  all levels invariably have their roots in politicians raising huge sums from  special interests. Consider the present predicaments of three well-known  California politicians: U.S. Sen. Alan Cranston, Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley  and -- more seriously -- state Sen. Joseph B. Montoya, who is on trial. The  most serious of the difficulties in which they are enmeshed stem in some part  from the ways in which they raised money for their election campaigns.  </P> <P> So what is to be done? Piecemeal approaches to the problem -- mostly involving  greater disclosure and limits on the size and kind of contributions -- have  been on the political agenda for nearly 20 years. As the evidence indicates,  partial solutions are not equal to the task. What does seem promising, though,  is the comprehensive, three-pronged approach incorporated in the City of Los  Angeles Ethics Act and already adopted in New York City, Seattle, Tucson and  Sacramento County. The essential reform triad consists of:  </P> <P>  -- Voluntary ceilings on campaign expenditures;  </P> <P>  -- Limits on the size of contributions;  </P> <P>  -- Partial public financing of campaigns through the mechanism of matching  funds for those candidates who agree to abide by spending limits and other  electoral regulations.  </P> <P> True, other steps are also worthwhile, such as Minnesota's restrictions on  off-year fund-raising and Alaska's tax refunds for small, individual  contributors or those which match contributions from within a lawmaker's  district at a higher level than those from without. So is a feature of New  Jersey's statute, included in the Los Angeles measure, which requires  recipients of public financing to agree to timely debates. But experience shows  that campaign-finance reform succeeds only when it incorporates all three of  the major principles enumerated above.  </P> <P> For instance, simply limiting contributions to candidates, as is the case with  the House and Senate, did nothing to inhibit the ability of wealthy savings and  loan executives to win what clearly was an excessively sympathetic hearing from  Cranston and other lawmakers. California has had rigorous disclosure laws for  some time and, more recently, a limit on contributions. Yet our electoral  problems continue to spiral out of control, while public participation and  confidence in state government plummet. San Francisco's last mayoral election  was the first conducted with a new, lower limit on contributions, and it was  the first in the city's history in which every candidate spent more than $1  million.  </P> <P> In Seattle, by contrast, a decade of experience with the three-point approach  has produced municipal politics that are widely admired for their integrity,  competitiveness and openness to women and minority candidates. In New York,  where four years ago former Mayor Ed Koch outspent his opponents seven to one,  new rules on public financing, contribution limits and a ceiling on  expenditures helped produce an election last year that was extremely  competitive.  </P> <P> Still, political reform is one of those issues on which serious-minded people  frequently have legitimate differences. In 1893, for example, California passed  what was then the nation's most advanced campaign-finance law. Called the  Purity In Elections Act, it provided, among other things, ceilings on  expenditures and a prohibition on transfers of funds from one candidate to  another. It subsequently was struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court because it  regulated primaries -- contests whose rules, the justices held, were purely a  partisan concern -- as well as general elections. The man who successfully  argued that position before the high court was a young lawyer named Hiram W.  Johnson, who less than 20 years later would be swept into the California  governor's mansion as the standard-bearer of Progressive reform.  </P> <P> Similarly, some Los Angeles City Council members have reservations about public  financing based on what they believe it will cost. Fortunately, the early  projections that created that anxiety appear unrealistic. Their estimated  expenditure of more than $20 million over four years includes the cost of an  ethics commission and staff, which most now agree the city will have in any  event. Moreover, the projected figure assumes the remote possibility that three  candidates will qualify for matching funds in every conceivable primary and  that there will be a runoff in every council race. That strains the limits of  probability. The projected cost of public financing for New York's recent  mayoral race was $28 million; the actual cost turned out to be slightly more  than $4 million. If cost really is a stopper, the simple, though not  necessarily ideal, solution is write a cap on public financing into the  ordinance.  </P> <P> Perhaps most important, the skeptics' approach to this issue neglects the  hidden costs of the status quo -- costs such as those incurred in the savings  and loan debacle or in the dozens of city planning decisions taken under the  watchful eye of wealthy -- and to officeholders, generous -- developers. Not  least among those hidden costs is the terrible erosion of public confidence  that leads a majority of Californians to believe their Legislature is on the  take. Democracy is a hands-on operation, but it does not work if the majority  of voters believe the levers of government are too dirty to touch.  </P> <P> Public financing of campaigns is the next logical step in that democratic  American tradition that began with the widest possible extension of the right  to vote and continues with the effort to ensure that the franchise is exercised  in equality. To that end, 19th-Century reformers abolished property  requirements for voters, and progressive thinkers in our own time successfully  fought to eliminate the poll tax.  </P> <P> The issue being debated in Los Angeles today is a vital chapter in that ongoing  struggle. By striking at the unwholesome, unequal influence of wealthy special  interests, the City of Los Angeles Ethics Act holds the promise of an electoral  system in which the rights and interests of every man and woman are equal not  only in the eyes of the law, but also in the eyes of the lawmakers.  </P></p>

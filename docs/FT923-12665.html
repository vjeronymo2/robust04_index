			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (28): Buy it for the wall not the bottom line - Summer sees the opportunity to snap up the work of tomorrow's top artists. But choose what you enjoy, or you may lose money / Alternative investments THE BRITISH middle classes are not great art collectors. They prefer to spend their surplus wealth on mortgages and school fees. But increasingly they are tempted into picture buying, both to decorate their homes and because they feel they could be investing in a bargain. There is nothing easier than to spend up to Pounds 5,000 on a picture. But how do you ensure that your purchase is a good buy? No one should collect art purely for investment: if they do, they will probably lose money. In the late 1980s, various sectors of British art - the Newlyn School, the Scottish Colourists - were hyped by dealers to inflated price levels. There are many people ruefully looking at a painting which has lost both its creative and its financial appeal. You should buy art because you enjoy a particular picture and want to live with it. That way you cannot lose. It's an added bonus if it slowly appreciates in value. There are some obvious rules for anyone concerned at the investment potential of their chosen painting. It should be a good work by an acknowledged artist and in perfect condition. Obviously a Royal Academician, or a member of the Royal Society of Watercolourists, or of the Society of Portrait Painters, comes with a seal of critical approval. Buying the work of a contemporary artist keeps the tradition of privatepatronage alive and makes for a more exciting commitment. Perhaps the biggest array of art of a guaranteed quality is provided by the Summer Show, which runs at the Royal Academy from early June until mid-August. A judging panel has selected more than 1,700 works, some by aspiring amateurs, from the 12,000 submitted, and leavened the display with contributions from the RAs. Few of the paintings by the RAs are priced below Pounds 5,000, but most others are modestly valued. The Summer Show is criticised for its traditionalism, but it provides an unparalleled display of mainstream British art. It is a good idea to contact the artist of any work you admire and commission a painting direct. This way you avoid paying the RA's (fairly modest) commission. One of the problems with buying art is that galleries, which often have a precarious financial existence, can demand from unknown artists commissions of up to 75 per cent in return for hanging their work, vastly inflating its retail price. Obviously it saves money to circumvent dealers, but owners of serious art collections have invariably amassed them through working with a good dealer, who offers experienced advice, and who will often agree to take back paintings if a client gets bored with them. If the Summer Show is the safe entree for the first-time buyer, anyone wishing to be at the cutting edge of art will be better served at the annual sale organised by the proselytising Contemporary Art Society, at Smiths in London's Covent Garden, in October. This presents itself as an art supermarket (it is actually sponsored by Sainsbury's) and offers over 1,000 paintings all priced below Pounds 1,750. Many are by established artists - Bridget Riley, Maggi Hambling and Craigie Aitchison were on the walls last year - who like to hang alongside younger artists. The aim is to encourage a new generation of informed collectors, and, in prosperous times, queues form hours before the opening in the hunt for bargains. If you are feeling even more experimental, you should sound out the Degree Shows of the leading art schools, such as the Royal College and St Martin's, in London: the top dealers certainly have a prowl around. These opportunities for the graduates to gain an instant reputation take place in June. Thirty odd years ago, if your eye was right, you could have acquired a Hockney for Pounds 20. The law of averages suggests that some of the young artists parading their collages, videos, mobiles, and sculptures will, in time, become RAs, great names in British art - and wonderful investments. You may be surprised at the prices some of the students ask - Pounds 1,000 plus is not unusual  - but haggling should secure a satisfactory deal. The success of the Degree Shows has encouraged other art colleges to pool their resources for a London view, and 40 of them are participating in 'Fresh Art', to be held at the Business Centre in Islington from July 17. If you are serious about art, rather than just looking for a picture to decorate the living-room wall, you really should go to the college shows, to take the pulse of the new generation. Also at the Business Centre, the dealers in contemporary art gather once a year to excite traditional customers and tempt in new buyers. Art 93 will be held in January. Along with such established events as the Whitechapel Open, where artists from London's East End, which numerically houses the largest congregation of artists in the world, show the inspirations of the loft culture, and the Bath Contemporary Art Fair in May, these are the main gatherings events of the British contemporary art world. Of course, the country is dotted with galleries. In certain parts of London  -Portobello, Hackney, Barnes - they congregate in considerable numbers. Glasgow and Edinburgh are well served to exploit the current high reputation of the younger generation of Scottish artists. The recession has hit galleries hard, and there have been many closures. Artists are pursuing other avenues to sell their work - displays in restaurants, offices, local craft fairs. These days you could find your chosen work virtually anywhere. The auction houses are also becoming more involved in selling contemporary art at modest prices, and Sotheby's and Christie's in particular have sales two or three times a year at which they expose established names to open bidding. Obviously, in many cases this is buying art wholesale, avoiding the dealers' mark-up. Prices of art have stabilised or fallen in the past two years. Some forms, especially watercolours, are undeservedly cheap compared with oils, and there are bargains to be had in limited-edition prints - provided the edition really is limited. No one should rush into buying a painting, or a sculpture. Visit galleries and fairs, study auctions and the art press, absorb yourself in the subject. Make sure you really love the work you buy. And never buy just for investment. Then there is a good chance that you will acquire a family friend that could provide a windfall in the future.</p>

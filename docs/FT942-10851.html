			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / Mixed attitudes to the magnet of Germany Janusz R, a carpenter, has it all worked out. He lives in the Polish town of Miedzyrzecz, not far from the German border. 'I'm far better off going over to Berlin every couple of weeks. I stay with my cousin. And I earn lots of money on the building sites. Then I can go home, buy building materials, and can afford to take off time to build my own house with my German savings.' Janusz is just one of the many thousands of Poles, Irish, Turks and Portuguese who are helping to rebuild Berlin. 'Everybody talks about the unemployment in east Berlin and in east Germany. But these east Germans just don't want to get their hands dirty,' said Mr Wolfgang Korich, a supervisor of a building site in east Berlin's Mitte, once the heart of Berlin before the second world war and now a prime development area for shopping and office complexes. Mr Kohrich, however, has few complaints about his foreign workers. 'They work in all kinds of weather. We don't have to pay them bad weather money,' he said. 'And my foreign men work at least 60 hours a week. None of this seven-hour-a day nonsense. And they don't drink on the site either, unlike some Germans who have the beer bottle open by 8am,' he continued. Yet some foreign workers, such as Mr Vincent Kelly who arrived from Ireland several months ago, complain about wages. 'There's no work at home. So I am lucky to get work here. But when I compare what I earn to a German, it really makes me angry,' he said. Mr Kelly says he earns DM25 an hour before tax. 'But the Germans earn DM38 - and that's the minimum paid to an unskilled worker, if such a thing exists among the Germans. After all the tax is deducted, I take home about DM13 an hour while they get DM24. Its not fair.' Mr Kohrich admits he pays his foreign workers at least a third, if not a 50 per cent, less than his German crew. A hundred yards down the street, a team of 200 workers were hard at work; there was hardly a German on the site. 'Half of us are Portuguese. The other half is Polish,' said one. 'We do the excavation work, the Poles do a lot of the scaffolding. The wages vary. What would you expect?' But the Association for the German Construction Industry is furious about the number of foreigners working in the building sites throughout eastern Germany. 'Some local councils, city authorities, and building firms are contracting out to foreign companies because they can do things more cheaply,' said Mr Heiko Stiepelmann, the association's spokesman. 'This means competition. This could affect the wage levels in the industry.' Janusz laughed when he heard this. 'And show me a site which only has German workers,' he quipped. 'These Germans are just too over-qualified, or else they get paid too much when they are out of a job. I think that's the reason why there is a shortage of construction workers,' he said. 'I don't know what the association is complaining about. They get us cheaply. The work gets done. So they should stop grumbling.'</p>

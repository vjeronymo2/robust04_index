			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Vilnius, Jan 26, BNS -- The reaction of Belarusian  authorities to the arrest of two Lithuanian communist leaders in  Minsk will "undoubtedly cast a chill over our relations" with  Belarus, Lithuanian Prime Minister Adolfas Slezevicius said on  Lithuanian radio Wednesday.    The premier said he regrets such "energetic" reaction, which  shows that Lithuania's neighbors "have not yet completely shaken  off old principles and formulas." In Slezevicius' opinion, the  problem also resulted from political tensions in Belarus.    The Lithuanian premier said the arrest operation in Minsk  was  indeed very successful and fully coordinated with Belarusian  authorities.    Slezevicius said he will seek to further expand the earlier  positive developments in Lithuanian-Belarussian relations.</p>

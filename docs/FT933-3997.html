			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Reverse for Ford leaves Gowrings in the red WITH TURNOVER down from Pounds 26.84m to Pounds 25.69m, Gowrings, the motor dealer and leisure group, suffered pre-tax losses of Pounds 137,000 for the first six months of 1993, against Pounds 172,000 profits. Mr John Fowles, chairman, stated that the two Ford dealerships experienced 'a most difficult six months' trading'. He explained that Ford's loss of market share, together with an erosion of new car margins and reduced manufacturer's incentives, 'had a dramatic effect on our results'. The leisure division produced doubled trading profits for the period of Pounds 187,000 (Pounds 90,000) while the motor side made just Pounds 3,000 (Pounds 270,000). Losses per share were 1.84p against 1.62p earnings and the interim dividend is unchanged at 1p.</p>

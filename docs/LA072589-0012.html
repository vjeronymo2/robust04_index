			<p><P> July 25, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> About 1,000 gallons of diesel fuel spilled into San Diego Bay late Sunday when  a Navy fuel supply line broke, officials reported.  </P> <P> The spill occurred about 8 p.m. at a fuel supply facility on Point Loma  Submarine Base, when a supply pipe broke while the Navy oil carrier Kiwishiwi  was being refueled, a Navy spokesman said.  </P> <P> Navy officials Monday were uncertain why the pipe broke.  </P> <P> Between 6,000 to 8,000 gallons of fuel poured from the supply line, but about  3,000 gallons flowed into a dam designed to catch leaking fuel and another  2,000 to 4,000 gallons was absorbed into the ground, said Chief Craig Huebler,  a Navy spokesman.  </P> <P> Two fuel skimmers and other cleanup equipment had cleaned the diesel fuel from  the bay by mid-afternoon, he said.  </P> <P> The Navy also sent a veterinarian to check on sea lions and other mammals in  the area, including dolphins at a Navy research center nearby, and collected  water samples to test for possible environmental damage, he said.  </P> <P> Initial Navy reports showed no damage to the mammals or the marine environment,  Huebler said. State Fish and Game Department officials are investigating.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] has claimed  responsibility for the attack on the trans-Samaria highway, that  killed Tzipora Sason from Ari'el. Our correspondent Moti Amir  reports that graffiti sprayed in the Ramallah area said the  'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam squad had perpetrated the attack.  [Reporting on Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0905 on 19  February, Amir adds that a Hamas leaflet faxed to the radio  station and signed by 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam also claimed  responsibility for the attack.]    Our correspondent further reports that after the attack, the  IDF [Israel Defense Forces] detained several men suspected of  participating in the act or possessing knowledge about the  perpetrators.    Tzipora Sason was shot by two rounds fired from a parked  vehicle at the car in which she was traveling with her husband  and two children. She was hit in the head and abdomen, and she  died of her wounds.    Our correspondent notes that Major General Dani Yatom, the  Central Command commander, and Major General Sha'ul Mufaz, the  IDF regional commander, are overseeing the investigation on the  site of the attack.    Reacting to the attack, Likud Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu  said the government should beef up the IDF deployment in the  area and launch an offensive on terrorists, rather than  preoccupy itself with withdrawal.    Tzomet Chairman Refa'el Eytan told our correspondent Hayim  Hecht that the IDF should clamp a curfew on all the Arab  villages along the trans-Samaria highway and maintain it until  the murderers are apprehended.    Moledet leader Knesset Member Rehav'am Ze'evi called on the  government to provide Jews residing in Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza  with full protection.    [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 0900 GMT on 19 February  adds  that reacting to the attack, the YI'UD [Independent and  Democratic Israel] faction said all Hamas activists suspected of  terrorist activity should be deported, and a closure should be  imposed on Arab population centers in the territories."]</p>

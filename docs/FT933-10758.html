			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / UK Gilts: Turmoil brings good times THE fabric of European monetary union is in disarray and the ruling Conservative party has suffered a crushing regional defeat. Meanwhile, the UK government bond market, which thrives on economic and political stability, starts the week at a new high. On Friday, gilt prices at the ultra-long end of the yield curve hit levels unseen for more than 20 years. Rising prices mean falling yields, which mirror the market's perception of where inflation is heading. At the end of the week, 8 3/4 per cent Treasury stock maturing 2017 - the longest-dated and thus most risky issue to hold - was yielding only 7.825 per cent. However, gains were seen at all points of the curve. The 7.25 per cent issue maturing in March 1998 rose  13/16 to 102 13/16 , while the 8 per cent stock due June 2003 jumped by well over a percentage point to 104 23/32 . The first surprise came in the middle-maturity range, when the Bank of England auctioned Pounds 3.25bn of eight-year stock. The size of the issue matched the previous record a month ago, when the Bank targeted overseas investors and attracted a poor response. Last Wednesday's auction appeared to be aimed at nobody in particular - the maturity was too long to interest banks and building societies, but too short for the pension funds. It was also payable in three tranches which, for tax reasons, was expected to deter the overseas investor. But demand was so fierce there was no tail - the difference between the average accepted bid and the lowest accepted bid. True, it was attractively-priced, and the market had positioned itself well, but one economist said the lesson to the Bank of England had to be: 'If you can sell this maturity at this time you can sell anything.' Then, on Thursday and Friday, the European exchange rate mechanism stood on the edge of an abyss as the French franc plummeted through its official ERM floor of FFr3.4305 against the D-Mark. The Danish krone, Spanish peseta and Belgian franc were tumbling. Overseas investors, who had been piling into the gilts market, redoubled their enthusiasm. Yields on short-dated maturities, which indicate the market's expectation of interest rate cuts, fell sharply. Investors were convinced that if the ERM fell it would enable member countries to cut rates in order to relieve the pressures on their economies and ease growing unemployment. The UK would then need to cut base rates to maintain its competitive advantage. Finally, long-dated stock sailed comfortably though the rocks of the Christchurch by-election, where the Tory party lost a safe seat with a 35 per cent swing against it. Overseas investors, who have been the mainstay of the recent rally, considered the defeat a parochial mid-term matter. As far as the international investment community is concerned, there is still enough evidence that the inflationary pressure which makes long maturities tremble is a long way away. By Friday afternoon, the Bank of England was so optimistic that it announced a Pounds 1.3bn issue of stock ranging right along the yield curve. It announced Pounds 500m of 7 1/4 per cent five-year stock, Pounds 500m of 8 per cent stock maturing in 2013, and Pounds 300m of 2 1/2 per cent index-linked stock repayable in 2020. However, the outcome of yesterday's emergency meeting in Brussels on Europe's buckled currency ladder is bound to reverberate through the UK bond market.</p>

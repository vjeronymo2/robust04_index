			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Survey of South Africa (13): Federalism arrives by the back door - The struggle for power in South Africa's new provincial regions South Africa's political landscape is shifting by the day, but nowhere is the movement more rapid than in the country's nine new provinces. Provincial premiers are clamouring for power, and in some cases exercising powers to which they have no right under the constitution. Turf battles are under way to determine who controls the Reconstruction and Development Programme: the provinces or the centre. And the fight over funding the provinces has not even begun. Despite the best efforts of African National Congress and National Party constitutional negotiators, it looks as though federalism has arrived in South Africa - albeit by the back door. And, ironically, it is not the 'dissident' provinces of KwaZulu Natal and Western Cape - ruled respectively by the Inkatha Freedom Party and the National Party - but the provinces controlled by the majority party, the African National Congress, who are posing the greatest challenge to the centre. 'We knew the provinces were going to cause problems and the provinces that were going to cause the most problems were the ANC provinces,' says Mr Zola Skweyiya, minister of the public service and administration and the man charged with devolving powers to the new provincial administrations under the 1993 constitution. 'The tension between the provinces and centre will cut across the political divide,' says Mr Thozamile Botha, head of the Commission on Provincial Government, established to determine the extent of powers granted to provinces under the existing constitution, and under the new constitution due to be negotiated over the next two years in the newly elected constituent assembly. 'The main confrontation in the constituent assembly is not going to be between the ANC-NP-IFP but between the (ANC-led) national government and regional premiers of the ANC,' says Mr Skweyiya. The centrepiece of the battle will inevitably be the Reconstruction and Development Programme; ultimately, provincial governments will stand or fall according to how well they deliver on the RDP's promises. But their power to do so is circumscribed: central government sets norms and standards for RDP programmes which could, in some cases, impede delivery at provincial level. For example, Mr Joe Slovo, national housing minister, has made clear that he opposes using RDP funds for so-called 'site and service' schemes: programmes which provide basic services to squatter communities and allow them to construct their own shelter from whatever materials are available. Housing experts agree that, however morally distasteful such schemes, they provide the only realistic solution to South Africa's massive housing backlog. Provinces which are forced to build formal housing with their RDP allocation from central government will end up satisfying only a fraction of their constituents - and this will have inevitable electoral consequences. Tensions will inevitably arise over central government's constitutional right to impose uniform norms and standards throughout the country, and over the centre's right to allocate funding to provinces, on the basis of a formula yet to be agreed by a Financial and Fiscal Commission established under the constitution. Provinces have only very limited powers to raise revenues of their own. 'The key question is finance,' says Mr Skweyiya. 'What power do you really have if you have to account to central government for what you want to do and persuade them to finance it?' The answer to that question is as yet far from clear: the political battle over the powers of provinces has only just begun. Their powers are outlined in the national constitution, subject to a vaguely worded over-ride clause which would allow central government to intervene in most areas if it wished. But before being allocated such powers, they must prove they are capable of exercising them. 'All these provinces are saying: 'We want all our powers now.' But the reality is that there is not an administration in all these provinces yet, there is just an elected government,' says Mr Botha. In extreme cases such as the Northern Cape, a new province created at the elections, no administration yet exists. Questions of long-term importance remain unresolved. Who will set the curriculum of provincial schools? Who will decide how teachers are paid? Who will set university entrance qualifications? These are political, not constitutional questions although ultimately, if they cannot be resolved by political negotiation, the final arbiter will be the Constitutional Court. And the political battle between provinces and the centre has only just been joined. Ironically, as ANC provincial leaders admit privately, they will be strengthened in their cause by the elements of federalism introduced into the constitution by their chief rival, the Inkatha Freedom Party - provisions which they fought bitterly at the time. It truly is a new South Africa.</p>

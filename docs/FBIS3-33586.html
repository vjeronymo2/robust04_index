			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] So far it is a rumor: Colonel German Linares may  be appointed police attache to the Bolivian Embassy in  Washington. The Bolivian Foreign Ministry has not confirmed this  rumor. Anyway, Linares cannot be appointed as attache until his  pending trial is resolved in Bolivia. The facts were made public  thanks to Senator Andres Solis Rada.    Ten years ago, in 1984, a lawsuit was filed against a long  list of individuals accused of being involved in the kidnapping  of the then-president of the Republic, Hernan Siles Suazo. The  name of Col. German Linares is on the list and he is allegedly  one of the main individuals responsible for that criminal action  and the coup attempt. However, the trial was paralyzed a long  time like many other lawsuits that sleep in the courtrooms of  our country.    Solis Rada, alarmed at the possibility that Linares might be  appointed to a diplomatic post, remembered the case and asked  District Attorney Javier Dipps to reactivate the trial.  Therefore, this not only means that Col. Linares cannot be a  diplomat, but he cannot even leave the country. [passage omitted]</p>

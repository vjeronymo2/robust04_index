			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Allied-Lyons shake-upreceives cautious welcome WIDE-RANGING management changes at Allied-Lyons, the UK drinks and food group, yesterday received a cautious welcome in the City. The moves, involving the early departure of the chairman and chief executive, came in an effort to repair damage to investor confidence caused by losses of Pounds 147m on the group's foreign exchange trading. Analysts suggested, however, that the shake-up may not be enough to ease concern entirely or to damp speculation about a takeover bid. One analyst said the changes were 'the least that could be done'. There has been heavy trading in Allied's shares in the past week amid rumours of possible predators for the Pounds 4bn group. The shares dropped 9p to 552p yesterday but were still 32p up on the week. Leading the changes, Sir Derrick Holden-Brown, chairman, has accepted 'ultimate responsibility' for inadequate management controls over the group's foreign currency dealings and will retire a year early in July. Mr Richard Martin will give up his post as chief executive. Mr Michael Jackaman, architect of the group's successful wine and spirits division, will take over as chairman, and Mr Tony Hales, head of the J Lyons food division for the past two years, will become chief executive. Recruitment of a prominent outsider to one of these posts would have restored confidence more quickly, analysts suggested, although a finance director will be brought in from outside to succeed Mr Cliff Hatch, who resigned in March. There was recognition of Mr Jackaman's achievements in restructuring Hiram Walker-Allied Vintners, and Mr Hales's refocusing of the group's food operations. Analysts also welcomed the appointments of Mr David Jarvis, 44, former Allied Distillers boss and since last year responsible for Far East and special markets, who will head the food division; and Mr John Giffen, 52, managing director of Hiram Walker-Allied Vintners, who will assume full responsibility for the wines and spirits division. Sir Derrick, in a letter to shareholders yesterday, said an investigation into the losses by KPMG Peat Marwick McLintock, the company's auditor, had revealed that Allied's treasury had been 'dealing in foreign currency instruments which were inappropriate, and in which it lacked the requisite trading skills'. The scale of the trading, which led to an exposure of Pounds 1.5bn before NatWest was called in to close positions in March, had been excessive. Sir Derrick, who was first alerted by the Bank of England to unusual dealing activity last summer, said an internal investigation then had found no need for further action. After further warnings, it was discovered that the group's exposure limit of Pounds 500m had been breached. Changes in treasury staff and efforts to bring foreign currency exposures 'to more prudent levels' were made. Accrued losses diminished significantly in February but the position deteriorated again as efforts were made to trade out of the losses. Sir Derrick said there was no evidence of dishonest or corrupt practices. It was 'an isolated occurrence . . . though I do not seek to minimise the seriousness of the losses incurred'. Foreign exchange trading had now been restricted to 'the more conventional type of treasury activity'.</p>

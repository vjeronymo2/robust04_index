			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / International Company News: Fila confirms NYSE listing plan FILA, the Italian sports shoes and clothing maker owned by the Gemina holding company, has confirmed plans to quote 30 per cent of its shares on the New York Stock Exchange. The move, which follows a similar decision last month by Gemina to list shares in the Natuzzi furniture group, reflects growing disenchantment by Italian companies with the domestic stock market and their readiness to make initial public offerings abroad. It is believed similar plans are being considered by Benetton Sportsystem, the fast-growing sports goods group being assembled by the acquisition of famous brands by the Benetton family. Bankers believe a listing for the group, which had sales of Dollars 608m in 1992, could come in the second half of next year. Fila, one of Italy's best-known sports brands, has branched out from clothing into footwear. The development has been accompanied by a marked internationalisation of its business, with the US accounting for 58 per cent of sales. Gemina will place 37.5m Fila shares, held by its Gemina Investments subsidiary, in New York in a deal led by Salomon Brothers and Goldman Sachs. The shares represent 30 per cent of Fila's capital. Gemina Investments will retain 6 per cent, while the Gemina parent company controls the remainder. The offering will be made via 7.5m American Depositary Shares, each comprising five Fila shares. Separately, Gemina Investments is placing 10 per cent of its 15 per cent stake in Natuzzi as part of an initial public offering in the US. The deal is part of a placing of 30 per cent of Natuzzi's stock in the US.</p>

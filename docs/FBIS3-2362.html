"Bringing the Chinese scientists to the frontiers of the  world science and technology" was what Professor Zhou Guangzhao,  president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), the  country's top scientific body, called it.    "We're trying to make CAS one of the most active and  productive members of the world's scientific family," said  Professor Zhou in an interview at his office in Beijing, where a  huge world map hangs on the wall.    CAS, which was set up 45 years ago on a Soviet Union-style  framework, now has 125 research institutes and 100,000  scientists, engineers and other staff members.    The country's reforms over the past 15 years have freed the  academy from its closed ivory-tower system and established a new  system which is fully open to the world and society.    So far, the CAS has established close ties with 3,000  Chinese  industrial enterprises and more than 500 high-tech enterprises  or joint ventures.    In another move, at the Congress of CAS Academicians this  June, a number of outstanding foreign scientists are due to be  elected to the prestigious scientific body, for the first time  in its 45 year- history.    "Natural sciences are the laws of nature and they are free  from the limits of national boundaries," Professor Zhou said,  "and scientific discoveries and inventions are the common  property of mankind."    He added: "Only in an open system can the CAS fully absorb  the advanced scientific results of the world to raise China's  academic level, while making their own contributions to the  world."    Professor Zhou said that the academy will join the  international efforts to solve such global issues as the  problems of sustainable development, rapid growth of population,  shortages of resources and deteriorating ecological environment.    "If scientists are not able to make breakthroughs in the  technologies of solar energy and nuclear fusion in the next few  centuries, it will be difficult for human civilization to  continue," Zhou said.    Zhou said that the academy has taken a number of moves such  as setting up national open laboratories, post-doctorate posts,  national research centers, sending graduate students abroad, and  cultivating 100 internationally-known scientists before the end  of this century.    "Once at the frontiers of the world sciences, the Chinese  scientists will provide the world with their own contributions,"  he said.    "Building a world-class university" was what professor Wang  Dazhong, president of Qinghua University was thinking about.  Qinghua is the country's top university.    Professor Wang spoke to the reporters at his office, which  dates back to the mid-19th century.    "Since the competition of economy, science and technology in  the 21st century will eventually turn out to be the competition  of talents, Qinghua will strive to become one of the top-notch  universities in the world by the year 2011, its centenary," he  said.    "Best university means producing best students," he said.  "We  will train high-level scientists, engineers, entrepreneurs and  government officials who are in great demand by China's emerging  market economy."    According to Professor Wang, among the more than 500  academicians in the Chinese Academy of Sciences, 160 graduated  from Qinghua. Twenty-nine members or alternative members of the  14th Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party graduated  from or once worked in Qinghua.    A comprehensive university, Qinghua has Vice-Premier Zhu  Rongji as head of its School of Economic Management, Professor  Zhou Guangzhao head of the School of Sciences, and Professor  Teng Teng, vice-president of the Chinese Academy of Social  Sciences, head of the School of Humanities.    Professor Wang said that the university will promote the  transfer of scientific results into productivity by developing  high-tech enterprises.    It is planning to set up an enterprise group and a science  and technology garden for cooperation with the industries and  enterprises from both home and abroad.    A committee consisting of representatives from the  university  and from industry is expected to be established to develop  cooperation with the world's renowned enterprises.    "Taking a firm hold of the world's market of high-tech  products" is what Professor Liu Chuanzhi, president of the  Legend Group, the largest Chinese high-tech enterprise overseas,  is thinking about.    When he launched his company in Beijing nine years ago, Liu  could not afford 200 yuan to install a telephone at his office.  Now his company has become the biggest computer firm in Hong  Kong.    Liu spoke to the reporters at his luxurious office in  Beijing, which he explained was prepared to receive  international industrial giants.    "I have now finally realized my dream of turning scientific  results into products, and sold China's high-tech products in  the world market," Liu said.    The company was started with seed money of 200,000 yuan  provided by the CAS.    The company, which expands as fast as a legend can tell you,  is now producing 10 percent of the computer display cards in the  world, making it a well-known computer firm abroad.    Its sales volume last year hit three billion yuan, 40  percent  of which was sold on overseas markets. Last month, Legend  became China's first high-tech company to be listed on Hong Kong  stock market.    He said, "In the highly competitive world of the computer  industry, in order to keep a significant market at home, we are  also striving to enter the world market."    "The Legend Group has set up its information center at  Silicon Valley in the United States, its research center in  China's Shenzhen Special Economic Zone, and its development  center in Hong Kong," Liu said. "That is why we are leading the  world in the computer display cards manufacturing."    According to Liu, the Hong Kong branch of the Legend was set  up with only 300,000 Hong Kong dollars of investment. Now it  has turned up to be the number one computer firm in Hong Kong,  with a fixed asset of one billion Hong Kong dollars.    Liu said the Legend is to combine the mainland's high  technologies, market, and distribution system with Hong Kong's  sales style and information.    The company has now established 14 branch companies in the  United States, Britain, France, Germany, Canada, Australia and  Singapore, selling its products all over the world.</p>

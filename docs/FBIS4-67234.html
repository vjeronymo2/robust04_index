			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Galina Gridneva] </F>   [Text] Dushanbe May 16 TASS -- Special units of  Tajikistan's Interior Ministry and the country's special  services are mounting a large-scale operation "Mak-94"  (Poppy-94) to locate and eliminate plantations of opium poppy  and hemp, an uphill job because most of the plantations, some of  which cover tens of hectares, are located in the mountainous  regions of northern and eastern Tajikistan, difficult-of-access.  This was announced in an interview with ITAR-TASS by First  Deputy Interior Minister of Tajikistan, Major-General Gennadiy  Blinov.    He explained that the owners of such plantations are, as a  rule, were alarmed and often have tested ties with local  authorities. [as received]    The wave of drug-trafficking and drug abuse continues to  sweep Tajikistan, which has become a major base from which  narcotics are delivered to near abroad and Western Europe,  Gennadiy Blinov said. He stressed that practically one half of  crimes committed in the republic is associated with the  narco-business.    Since the beginning of this year, Tajikistan's security  forces have suppressed 19 attempts at illegal exports of  unprocessed opium and hashish and located tens of underground  syndicates specialising in manufacturing and storing narcotics,  the general said. A total of 200 kilograms of drugs have been  seized.    However according to General Blinov, the main flow of drugs  comes from neighbouring Afghanistan to Tajikistan's  Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region, where several drug barons  run mafia-like groups. According to Gennadiy Blinov, the drug  flow from Afghanistan can be suppressed by tightening control  over the Pamir stretch of the Tajik-Afghan border, which  regrettably remains highly transparent.    For a number of reasons only between 15 and 20 in each  hundred of crimes associated with narcotics are ever exposed,  the general said. He called for a comprehensive state programme  and concerted efforts of the security agencies of all  Commonwealth member-countries, whose ties have weakened  considerably since the break-up of the Soviet Union.</p>

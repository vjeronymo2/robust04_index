			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent Liu Linzong (0491 2651 1350) and reporter </F> Li Xiuqing (2621 4423 3237)]    [Text] Beijing, 25 Feb (XINHUA) -- The simulated satellite  successfully launched into space by the carrier rocket "Long  March 3-A" on 8 February was officially named the "Star of the  Hualing Group" at the China Institute of Carrier Rocket  Technology today. It was the first time in our country's  aerospace history that a man-made earth satellite was named  after an enterprise.    Guangzhou's Hualing Limited Company Group mainly produces  Hualing-brand refrigerators and other household electrical  appliances, and is one of "the country's top 10 enterprises that  produce household electrical appliances." To support our  country's aerospace service, the company donated 500,000 yuan to  the aerospace industry before the "Long March 3-A" rocket was  launched. To express its gratitude, the rocket technology  institute painted the Hualing group's business emblem on the  satellite's cowling and placed inside the satellite a model of  the national gold medal awarded to the company.</p>

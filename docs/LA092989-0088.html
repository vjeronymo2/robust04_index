			<p><P> September 29, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: UPBEAT ZSA ZSA RETURNS TO COURT  </P> <P> An upbeat Zsa Zsa Gabor breezed into Beverly Hills Municipal Court Thursday,  saying she was feeling "confident and happy," a marked change from the day  before, when she bolted out in anger, vowing never to return to her  cop-slapping trial.  </P> <P> Gabor had burst out of the courtroom several minutes after she took exception  with closing statements by Deputy Dist. Atty. Elden Fox.  </P> <P> "Last night I was furious," the former glamour queen declared. "I'm not angry  any more. I'm here to be here."  </P> <P> The jury Thursday ended its first full day of deliberations in the misdemeanor  trial and will resume discussions this morning.  </P> <P> Asked what she thought the outcome of her trial would be, the former Miss  Hungary, dressed in a red suit and diamond earrings, replied: "How do I know?  I'm feeling confident and happy. I came here to show you guys (reporters) I'm  not afraid to wear my diamonds. I earned it all legally."  </P> <P> Gabor, apparently following her lawyer's advice, left the courthouse at  lunchtime, and after a shopping trip went home to await word on the verdict.  </P></p>

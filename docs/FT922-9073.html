			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Directors' Transactions DIRECTORS' dealing activity has now calmed down to a more reasoned level where the overall picture is no longer distorted by one-off influences. Clinton Cards retails greeting cards and gifts throughout England. Directors have been buying shares during April. Most recently Clinton Lewin, the managing director, and Don Lewin, the chairman, both bought 25,000 shares at 76p. That is 16p higher than the price at which three directors bought two weeks earlier. Selling at Renishaw, the metrology and inspection equipment company, has been a feature since the end of last year. Most recently Allan Roberts, the finance director, sold 24,000 shares at 272p. John Hall, the deputy chairman of Hall Engineering, and Robert McAlpine, a non-executive director, both purchased shares in this steel processing group. Hall bought 14,000 shares at 152p in an off-market deal on April 29, while McAlpine paid 148.5p for 15,000 shares from the market on April 23. Results were announced at the beginning of April and the chairman said that the board was confident about future prospects.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- DIRECTORS' SHARE TRANSACTIONS IN THEIR OWN COMPANIES (LISTED &amp; USM)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          No of Company               Sector      Shares    Value    directors  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SALES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Bowater nil pd          Pack       9,166       17            1 Croda                   Chem      25,000       46            1 Dalgety                 FdMa       6,100       25            1 Edmond Holdings          C&amp;C     550,000      237            1 Euro Motors nil pd      Motr     458,928      133            1 E W Fact                Buse      50,000       50            1 Farnell Electronics     Elns      30,000       94            1 GKN                     Motr       6,740       26            1 Hewden Stuart            C&amp;C      12,272       11            1 Leslie Wise             Text     200,000      134            1 Lowndes Lambert         InsB      27,112       85            1 Menvier-Swain           Elec       5,000       19            1 Merrydown Wine          Brew      10,000       36            1 More O'Ferrall           Med      11,350       27            1* Record Holdings         EngG     200,000      168            1 Renishaw                OthI      24,000       65            1 Sndsn Murray &amp; Elder    Motr       9,675       50            1 Tay Homes               C&amp;C       20,000       34            1 Transport Dev Group     Tran      40,000      108            1* TSW TV                   Med     130,000       59            1 US Smaller Co IT        InTr      10,000       10            1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PURCHASES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Barr (AG)               FdMa       5,000       10            1 Boustead                BuSe      50,000       12            1 City Site Est CCRP      Prop     171,000       49            1 Clinton Cards           Stor      50,000       38            2 Gt Southern CRP         Misc      50,000       50            1 Hall Engineering        EngG      15,000       22            1 Johnston Group          BdMa      30,000       56            2 Paramount               Brew     425,000       20            2 Redland                 BdMa       2,760       15            1 Torex Hire               C&amp;C     100,000       30            1 US Sm Co IT (Wts)       InTr      33,500       14            1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Value expressed in Pounds 000s.

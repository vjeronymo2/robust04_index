			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (9) whether any conforming changes should be made to the order if any or all of these proposals were to become effective.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Findings and Conclusions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The findings and conclusions on the material issues, all of which are based on evidence presented at the hearing and the record thereof, are:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Section 945.9 Ship or handle of the order should be amended to authorize the regulation of fresh market shipments of Irish potatoes within the production area, which includes Malheur County, Oregon, and the counties of Adams, Valley, Lemhi, Clark, and Fremont in Idaho, and all of the counties in Idaho lying south thereof. Currently, the order authorizes regulating interstate and foreign shipments of fresh market Irish potatoes grown in the production area. This recommended change would broaden the scope of the order to cover shipments within the production area, as well as those outside the production area. The Act exempts potatoes for canning, freezing, or other processing from regulation under any order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The lack of regulation of fresh market potatoes within the production area has caused a number of significant problems for the industry. Sales of unregulated potatoes within the production area have (1) depressed the price of potatoes sold in other markets; (2) made compliance more difficult since the committee cannot track these unregulated potatoes, allowing handlers to claim that their potatoes were sold within the production area and were thus exempt from regulation; and (3) adversely affected the committee's income since assessments are not collected on these potatoes. Yet, such handlers may receive the higher prices typically paid for the higher quality potatoes resulting from the committee's mandatory quality control activities, without absorbing any of the costs to conduct these activities. Based on per capita figures, an estimated 48.8 million pounds of Idaho-Eastern Oregon fresh market potatoes are consumed annually within the production area, compared with about 3.3 billion pounds of sales outside the production area. Since potatoes marketed within the production area are not currently subject to the order's mandatory inspection, minimum grade, size, quality, maturity, pack, and assessment requirements, the market for potatoes within the production area has received a large volume of poor quality, ungraded potatoes. The prices paid for such undesirable potatoes are typically lower than those paid for the better quality required under the order for potatoes shipped outside the production area. This lower quality price has depressed the price for all potatoes in that market. Also, with modern communications and daily Market News reports nationwide, lower prices in the production area become known quickly in other markets and have a depressing effect on prices in those markets as well. This negative effect on prices is contrary to the policy of the Act, which includes establishing and maintaining orderly marketing conditions and increasing returns to producers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Record evidence indicates that the price of potatoes in production area markets has a direct and immediate effect on prices in markets outside that area. Therefore, under the order, the handling of potatoes within the production area directly burdens, obstructs, or affects the handling of potatoes in interstate commerce to such an extent as to make appropriate the regulation of potatoes in Malheur County, Oregon, and in the counties of Adams, Valley, Lemhi, Clark, and Fremont in the State of Idaho, and all counties in Idaho lying south thereof.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although it was not included in the notice of hearing, the proponents testified that ``consign'' should be added to the other actions included in the definition of ``ship or handle'' specified in &sect;945.9. The record indicates that ``consign'' is defined as an agreement between a buyer and seller for the transportation of product to be marketed with no previous determination of the return of the product. It is the responsibility of the buyer to market the product and return to the seller the proceeds. This should be included as ``handling'' because the ``agent'' or ``handler'' who receives the commodity is engaged in the buying, selling and distributing of the commodity into market channels. Record evidence supported adding ``consign'' to the definition of ``ship or handle''.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

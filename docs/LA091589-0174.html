			<p><P> September 15, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DAVIS SAYS HE WILL MATCH BUYOUT OFFER FOR UNITED AIRLINES  </P> <P> Billionaire investor Marvin Davis today said he will match a $6.75-billion  buyout offer by pilots and managers of United Airlines that has been approved  by parent UAL Corp., should the pilot-management bid fall through.  </P> <P> Although he said any bidder competing with the pilots and managers is at a  "clear competitive disadvantage," Davis said he is ready to pay $300 a share --  without requiring any labor concessions -- if the employee-management bid is  not completed.  </P> <P> UAL opened $2.75 a share higher at $283.25 today on the New York Stock  Exchange.  </P> <P> On Thursday, UAL Corp.'s directors approved a $300-a-share, or $6.75-billion,  offer from the management-pilot group, which could result in the nation's  largest employee-owned company.  </P> <P> The plan, which includes a no-strike guarantee by the pilots and other  cost-cutting labor concessions, was the latest twist in a 6-week takeover  battle.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Hans O. Alfredsson: "Colliander Leaving </F> Politics"]    [Excerpt] Vivianne Franzen can now lead New Democracy  [NYD] unchallenged in the run-up to the election. Harriet  Colliander is withdrawing, but she still thinks that she is the  right and real party leader and that her party executive is the  right and real party executive.    Her resignation is the result of the ballot among members  that has been held since the extraordinary party congress. The  votes were counted on Tuesday [21 June]. It emerged that  Vivianne Franzen and her executive have the support of about 80  percent of those who took part in the ballot.    Given that this is the situation Harriet Colliander has  decided to give up. She is resigning as chairman of the party  executive that was elected at the regular party congress in  early April and will leave politics. She will not participate  in the election campaign and she will not run for the Riksdag  this fall. [passage omitted]</p>

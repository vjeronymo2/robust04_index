			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Nadir masterminded his own escape, businessman claims THE British businessman who helped Mr Asil Nadir jump his Pounds 3m bail yesterday rebutted police claims that there had been a 'Mr Big' who had organised the fugitive businessman's escape to northern Cyprus. Mr Peter Dimond, a former aircraft dealer, also said Mr Nadir's escape had been 'ridiculously easy' to organise, in spite of police surveillance. Speaking from northern Cyprus, for the first time since Mr Nadir fled the country, Mr Dimond told the Financial Times that he had organised the 'minute by minute' details of the flight which had taken Mr Nadir from Compton Abbas in Dorset to Beauvais in France - but insisted that Mr Nadir had masterminded the overall plans. 'Mr Big was Mr Nadir. He organised it himself,' said Mr Dimond, in response to reports that the Serious Fraud Office was seeking an individual who masterminded Mr Nadir's escape. Mr Dimond said new EC regulations, which do not require passport checks at airfields, had made it easy to arrange the journey, which had involved two aircraft and six airfields. 'It was so simple it was unreal. Anyone in the street could have done what I did,' he said. Mr Dimond said he had no intention of returning to England in the near future. If found guilty of aiding Mr Nadir to jump bail he could face charges under British law - although in practice it would be impossible to extradite him without the co-operation of the north Cypriot authorities. A senior British customs official confirmed last night that the aircraft carrying Mr Nadir had evaded UK customs and immigration checks. Referring to his escape from Compton Abbas, the official said that in an airport of that kind 'nobody would do anything about it', adding: 'We are in the single market.' Mr Dimond's role in the flight had started through his family friendship with Mr Nadir, who had known his wife, Mrs Hope Dimond, since the 1970s. Speaking from the family home in Hampshire yesterday, Mrs Dimond said: 'It was basically a social connection - we were friendly with his family. We had no business connection with Mr Nadir or Polly Peck at all.' According to Mr Dimond, he had decided to help with the escape because of frustration at the British authorities' treatment of Mr Nadir. 'We have watched very closely the way the situation has been handled,' he said. 'There was a time when it was time to go and so his friends said 'OK, let's do it.' It was just an act of friendship - like giving a friend a lift in a car.' A regular user of Compton Abbas airfield, Mr Dimond approached the airfield owner, Mr Clive Hughes, a week before Mr Nadir's departure to book an aircraft for himself and a friend. Then, on the morning of May 4, Mr Dimond and his friend arrived at the airfield. Mr Hughes said yesterday he had not recognised Mr Nadir, who had been dressed in dark glasses and a hat, and introduced to him as an 'aviation friend' of Mr Dimond. 'I did it as a private flight for a friend,' said Mr Hughes yesterday, who claimed that because the aircraft's intercom had been broken during the hour-long flight he had not spoken to Mr Nadir who had sat, facing backwards, in the rear of the aircraft. The only payment Mr Hughes had received had been Pounds 300 to cover the cost of fuel, he said. Mr Clive Vleiland-Boddy, owner of the piper aircraft, registration number G-BSPG, yesterday said that he had not known who had been using it. Under new EC regulations, Mr Hughes said, he had not been required to carry out any customs check, apart from handing out a leaflet explaining the passport regulations for passengers leaving England. When the aircraft arrived in Beauvais, Mr Dimond and Mr Nadir had joined a second aircraft, a Cessna Citation executive jet, registration N-11HJ, which had flown from Hatfield to meet them. 'I left them at the aircraft side. Peter knew I had to get back in a hurry,' said Mr Hughes, who said he was back in England three hours after he left. Mr Michael Hamlin, owner of Hamlin Jets, which manages the Hatfield airfield where the Citation jet was based, yesterday confirmed that the Citation had travelled from Hatfield to Beauvais and then on to Cyprus. He denied he had had any knowledge of the purpose of the journey.</p>

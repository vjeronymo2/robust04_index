			<p><P> December 4, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE;  </P> <P> AFFORDABLE-HOUSING PLAN UP FOR REVIEW  </P> <P> The City Council and Planning Commission will hold a joint meeting this  afternoon to consider modifying the city's year-old, affordable-housing plan.  </P> <P> Under the current plan, the city's goal is to require 25% of all new homes be  affordable to families earning less than the county's median income.  </P> <P> Half of those homes would be for families earning less than half of the  county's median income, which for a family of four is about $49,100 a year.  </P> <P> But current council members have criticized those affordable-housing goals as  unworkable or onerous.  </P> <P> Last week, the City Council waived the affordability requirement for a mobile  home park owner who objected to a requirement that one of four planned new  coach spaces be set aside for a low-income tenant. The council's recent  approval of a planned 3,700-home development also did not mandate affordable  units inside the project, as specified by the housing plan. TOM MCQUEENEY  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 11, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIRE CHIEF PUSHES FOR TOYS AS ALTERNATIVE TO FIREWORKS  </P> <P> Los Angeles Fire Chief Don Manning was mulling over how bans on fireworks  dampened the Fourth of July spirits of his five grandchildren when he started  thinking about fire-safe toys that could fill the void.  </P> <P> "I was wondering, boy, that would be nice rather than Grandpa saying 'no, no,  no' to fireworks," he recalled.  </P> <P> One day, he mentioned his thoughts to Jerry Pressman, a former board member of  the National Fire Academy and president of a Los Angeles firm that designs  fire-protection systems. Pressman discussed the possibilities with Northridge  businessman Jeff Rapport and, four months ago, Funnerworks Corp. was born in  Pasadena.  </P> <P> This week, the firm began marketing its line of toys, including  battery-operated sparklers, screaming balloon whistles and fire-retardant  bubble mats that make big pops when jumped on because they are reinforced with  nylon.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Intended as a Catalyst  </P> <P> The firm, which will cease selling the toys July 5, is intended strictly as a  catalyst to encourage major toy companies to create similar products, Pressman  said. The products will be sold only through charitable organizations and  volunteer auxiliaries of fire departments.  </P> <P> Sponsored by Rapport and anonymous donors he described as concerned fire  professionals, Funnerworks will limit its profits to 10%. Portions of every  sale and profits above 10% will be given to the Alisa Ann Ruch California Burn  Foundation of Canoga Park.  </P> <P> The statewide organization, which promotes education for fire and burn  prevention, was formed in 1971 as a memorial to Alisa Ann Ruch, an 8-year-old  from the San Fernando Valley who was fatally burned in a back-yard barbecue  accident.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Highly Appreciative'  </P> <P> "We're highly appreciative of anything that would divert people's attention to  less harmful things" than fireworks, said Monrovia Fire Chief Mark Foote at a  news conference in Monrovia, where the burn foundation has a branch office.  </P> <P> Noting that he is not endorsing any particular product, Manning said he is  "pleased that the private sector is responding to a need we see as a fire  service. We had a strong understanding from the very beginning that there would  be no profit."  </P> <P> The toys are available for sale at the foundation's Monrovia office on Colorado  Boulevard. Beginning July 1, they also will be sold at Santa Monica Community  College. For other locations, call (800) 334-SAFE.  </P></p>

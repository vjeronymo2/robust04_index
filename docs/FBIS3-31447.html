			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Edin Nuhic report] </F>   [Excerpts] The main topic of the news conference held by  the Party of Democratic Action [SDA] today was the current  political situation and NATO's ultimatum to the aggressor.  Journalists were addressed by party president Mirsad Ceman and  Fuad Didic, member of the Main Committee. Edin Nuhic reports:    [Nuhic] We are a bit skeptical about what is going to happen  after NATO's ultimatum expires. This was stated by SDA  President Mirsad Ceman at a news conference today. Considering  our experience so far, it is not realistic to expect the  ultimatum to be fully complied with. What is also  characteristic is that the aggressor is not behaving in line  with the threat that was addressed to it.    On the other hand, the visit by numerous world politicians  to  Sarajevo and the busy diplomatic activities in the world  indicate that there is a certain change in the international  community's attitudes toward the Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis. The  withdrawal of the weapons could, however, have some negative  effects, Mirsad Ceman said.    [Begin Ceman recording] Regarding the lifting of the siege  of  Sarajevo, we would particularly like to express our fear that  even if a more significant removal of heavy weapons deployed  around Sarajevo took place, these weapons could still be  deployed on other fronts, above all, as this is becoming  evident, to the Bihac region, and other regions where the  aggressor is carrying out attacks. Thus, NATO's decision, whose  purpose is to protect the (?unprotected) zones, would in fact be  brutally dodged, in another area. [end recording]    [Nuhic] The message of the SDA to the political leadership  of the country and the international community is to block the  roads that lead from Sarajevo to other regions and in this way  prevent the aggressor from deploying heavy weapons in other  regions.    The ultimate aim of the SDA is not to provoke NATO air  strikes, Fuad Didic, member of the party's Main Committee, said.    [Begin Didic recording] Our ultimate aim is to have the arms  embargo lifted. Our ultimate aim is arms in our own hands.  This means that our ultimate aim is to secure our survival. We  have not survived as a nation so far because of agreements. We  Bosnian Muslims have survived because of our armed resistance.  [end recording] [passage omitted]    [Nuhic] At the end of today's news conference, the SDA  representatives briefed the journalists on some details  concerning the visit by [Presidency Member] Nijaz Durakovic to  Australia. They said that they were told by the party members in  the Australian branch of the SDA that, speaking at some rallies,  Durakovic compared the SDA with the terrorist Serbian Democratic  Party, saying, we quote, Adilbeg is saving Bosnia with his own  means [not further specified].    It is unacceptable, Ceman said, that some members of  opposition parties should be entering the preelection campaign  in this way while SDA members are bleeding in defending Bosnia.</p>

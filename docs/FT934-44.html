			<p>931231 FT  31 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Rescue package agreed as Ossory cuts loss to Pounds 40.2m Ossory Estates, the property group, yesterday announced a reduction in pre-tax losses from Pounds 46.1m to Pounds 40.2m in the year to June 30, after lower write-downs against its property portfolio. A forecast earlier this month predicted that pre-tax losses would not exceed Pounds 41m. This coincided with proposals for a rescue package, approved by shareholders this week, which involves a financial restructuring, including a placing and open offer to raise Pounds 5.5m cash net of expenses, as well as some acquisitions. Following the reconstruction and new banking proposals pro forma net assets are Pounds 11m compared with Pounds 22.5m in liabilities last time. Last year's accounts had been qualified following the breach of banking covenants. The reorganised board is to rename the company Orb. Turnover rose to Pounds 13.1m (Pounds 12.9m), including a Pounds 2.79m (Pounds 5.01m) contribution from discontinued operations. Ossory wrote off Pounds 22.1m (Pounds 42.7m) against its investment properties while interest costs were Pounds 14.6m (Pounds 8.72m), including Pounds 5.22m relating to loan agreement settlement costs. Losses per share were 43.95p (53.15p).</p>

			<p><P> January 8, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> WASHINGTON, D.C.;  </P> <P> LECTURES SKETCH PRESIDENTIAL LIVES  </P> <P> A historian evoked poignant memories of Abraham Lincoln and his family for an  enraptured audience at the White House.  </P> <P> David Herbert Donald of Harvard University sketched everyday life in the White  House during the Civil War years for the 16th President, his spendthrift wife,  Mary Todd Lincoln, and their sons. The lecture was the first in a series that  President Bush and his wife, Barbara, are hosting on the presidency to, in  Bush's words, make "the men who held this office . . . come alive." "We always  think today our lives are so complicated," Mrs. Bush observed after the  lecture. "Then you look at what Lincoln stepped into . . . things look pretty  good for us."  </P></p>

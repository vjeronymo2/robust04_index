			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / UK Company News: All-round advance lifts Leeds 31% to Pounds 7.23m Leeds Group, the West Yorkshire-based textile dyer and printer, increased pre-tax profits by 31 per cent from Pounds 5.53m to Pounds 7.23m over the year to September 30. The group is proposing to lift the annual dividend by 16 per cent and make a 1-for-2 scrip issue. Mr Robert Wade, chairman, said that the dividend rise - up to 8.5p (7.33p adjusted for last year's scrip) via a 5.75p final - was the 27th consecutive annual increase for the group. Turnover expanded 14 per cent to Pounds 47.1m (Pounds 41.3m), though Mr Wade pointed out that a 30 per cent fall in wool prices for the second year running and the reduction in output at the Walsden factory hid an increase in volumes of about 15 per cent. The fire at Walsden made its way on to the profit and loss account via credits of Pounds 572,000 and Pounds 286,000 for business interruption insurance and material damage insurance respectively. Mr Wade said the group was having to look for future profits not from price increases, but rather cost cutting, higher volumes and other such measures. He said that about 30 per cent of the group's output went abroad, though the Japanese and European markets remained depressed. The Middle East was 'quite good, though not as good as last time', but new markets, such as Taiwan, South Korea, Thailand and Singapore, were doing well. 'All divisions of the group contributed to the increased profit,' said Mr Wade, with the two Dutch companies acquired in April for an initial Pounds 2.49m contributing Pounds 553,000, and the leasing side, often thought anomalous, making Pounds 356,000 (Pounds 286,000). Earnings per share, including the material damage insurance, emerged at 28.5p and excluding it at 26.9p, against 22.1p last time.</p>

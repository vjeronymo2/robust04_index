			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Belgrade, April 11 (TANJUG) -- The general staff of  the Bosnian Serb Republic Army reported Monday that its  artillery "was not shelling Gorazde at all and that therefore  UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] troops, representatives of  humanitarian organizations or the civilian population cannot be  in danger there".    "The Moslem war propaganda is hastily launching new fraud  from Gorazde, calculated to call for and justify the engagement  of the NATO airforce against the Serb people and army. It seems  as if some senior UNPROFOR officers and officials have joined in  the Moslem propaganda deceptions", the statement given to TANJUG  says.    NATO U.S. warplanes on Sunday evening launched air strikes  on  Bosnian Serb positions near the Moslem enclave of Gorazde, a  U.N.-designated "safe haven" which should have been  demilitarized last spring. In late March, about 10,000 Moslems  from Gorazde surged into a heavy offensive against Serb  territories.    Moslem fabrications about attacks on Gorazde fuel hasty  decisions on the use of force by the NATO aviation and  contribute to the escalation of war. This prevents and  postpones a lasting and complete cessation of hostilities and  the reaching of an agreement on lasting peace in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, the statement says.</p>

			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Wace doubles to Pounds 7m midway - Cost reductions and favourable exchange rates boost outcome A REDUCTION in costs helped the restructured Wace Group, the pre-press and specialist printing company headed by Mr Frans ten Bos, to more than double pre-tax profits from Pounds 3.3m to Pounds 7m in the half year to the end of June 1993. The result was also boosted by the fall in sterling against the dollar. Excluding the movement in currency exchange rates, profit before tax and exceptional items rose by 23 per cent to Pounds 6.8m. Severance pay accounted for the bulk of a Pounds 3.3m restructuring charge for which provisions were made at the end of last year. Net borrowings fell to Pounds 84.3m (Pounds 88.7m) representing gearing of 175 per cent. Mr Trevor Grice, chief executive, said he was confident of further reducing debt, but ruled out making any disposals or acquisitions in the short term. The UK businesses increased trading profit to Pounds 6m (Pounds 4.3m) as the workforce was slimmed down by 102 people to 2,462. Mr Grice said he had prevented 'silly things such as businesses competing against each other to qual-ify for bonuses' and had reduced the number of print sites. He warned that there was little sign of a UK economic recovery. Profits from the US operation fell to Pounds 3.2m (Pounds 3.7m). Mr Grice, who took over as chief executive last November after the sudden departure of Mr John Clegg, persuaded the banks not to sell the US businesses. In spite of a rationalisa-tion, resulting in a 4 per cent reduction in the workforce to 1,868, two of the businesses, in Phoenix and Dallas, reported losses of Dollars 1.4m. Mr Grice said there was no sign of a pick up in the US economy. Businesses in continental Europe, which Mr Grice described as having 'slumped into recession', reported a small fall in profits to Pounds 2m (Pounds 2.2m). Turnover increased to Pounds 165.4m (Pounds 156.5m). The interim dividend was cut to 1p (2.25p). Earnings per share of 4.1p compared with a restated loss of 0.2p. COMMENT Eliminating costs and refocusing the businesses, particularly in the UK, has produced a satisfactory result. So far, so good. The real test of Mr Grice's capability is still to come. If he can rejuvenate the US operations, which were once lined up for a fire sale, and grow the businesses across both sides of the Atlantic without the benefits of a restructuring, investors will have a lot more to thank him for. With forecast annual pre-tax profits of Pounds 15m, the shares - up 5p to 149p - are fairly priced on a prospective multiple of 16.</p>

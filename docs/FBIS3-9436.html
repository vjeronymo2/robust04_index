			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Gyula Horn, chairman of the Hungarian </F> Socialist Party, MSZP, by Pal Szombathy; place and date not  given: "The MSZP Will Not Put a Wedge Between the Forces of the  Liberal Bloc"]    [Text] If we want to implement a real governmental change,  then the Socialists cannot be left out of the next government,  Gyula Horn, chairman of the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP],  told MAGYAR HIRLAP. Talking about worrying phenomena, Horn  indicated that they have become aware of telephone tapping, and  certain people are watching the movements of socialist  politicians in the vicinity of their party offices from cars.    [Szombathy] Recently, you have stated a number of times that  the opposition does not know anything about the country's  economic situation. If this is true then how is it possible to  draw up an action program for governing?    [Horn] We know the size of the budget deficit, the state  debt, and we have information on the continuous deterioration of  the balance of payments. No one has denied that in the first  two months of 1994 the government spent the entire budget  reserve. Before the extension of the deadline, the state is  facing a 230-billion-forint obligation in connection with  compensation. However, the opposition is not aware of what kind  of domestic, or perhaps international, payment obligations the  government has undertaken in the period before the elections.  We asked the government to inform Parliament about the  country's true financial and economic balance but this was  refused. Parallel with the coalition talks, an expert team  should draw up a true picture that will largely influence the  next coalition's room for maneuver.    [Szombathy] What can you say about the arguments that are  used by the government to prove that the economic situation is  much better than is claimed by the opposition?    [Horn] Positive results must also have been achieved in the  past four years, but we cannot see even any traces of the  defined concept on the change of the economic structure. It is  futile to argue with a government that claims that agriculture  is a successful branch of the economy and privatization has only  positive results. In the course of this propaganda of success, I  find it unacceptable that the government has frightened people  with the colorful brochures that have been sent out in 1 million  copies. Personal data was used here that gives people the  impression that they are on file. We experienced this while we  were collecting the candidate nomination forms.    [Szombathy] In what areas can the new government expect some  surprises?    [Horn] In finding out what actually happened in the course  of privatization decisions. We do not know what kind of asset  distribution will take place in the remaining time. For me,  giving away headquarters buildings for nominal prices is  appalling; I am mainly thinking of the provisions to do with the  World Federation of Hungarians. As far as we know, most of the  asset distributions were legal, but unethical, which is a  different matter.    [Szombathy] What have you experienced of the oft-mentioned  fears of the population in the provinces?    [Horn] Fear can mainly be seen among the intelligentsia. In  other social groups, the determination for change is rather  strong. I am afraid that the campaign will become even rougher.  We are experiencing virtually inexplicable phenomena almost  every day: We see telephone tappings, and various cars are  waiting around our party premises, observing the movements of  MSZP officials. We receive many threats. Some television  programs also contribute to inciting hatred. The radio  dismissals can also increase the hatred. The new government will  have to implement political rehabilitation in connection with  these journalists, and this actually has a legal basis.    [Szombathy] Do you consider an opening toward the Alliance  of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] in opposition to the Federation of  Young Democrats [Fidesz], and toward the Christian Democratic  People's Party [KDNP] in opposition to the Hungarian Democratic  Forum [MDF] possible? Otherwise, would the establishment of  various blocs result in a new isolation of the MSZP?    [Horn] It is impossible for the liberal bloc to gain an  absolute majority; therefore, they will need a coalition  partner. If we want to achieve a real governmental change then  the Socialists cannot be left out of executive power. The  decisive factor is whether the current opposition parties --  this mainly applies to the Fidesz -- will take the need for  change seriously. However, this does not permit making an  alliance now with the MDF. The Fidesz has to decide what kind  of politics it wants to see implemented. We have normal  relations with the Free Democrats because their politics are  more predictable than those of their partner. In my view, a  social-liberal government is a real possibility. However, the  MSZP does not intend to drive a wedge between the forces of the  liberal bloc. The liberals are struggling with the situation  that they would definitely like to get into government in 1994  and, partly because of their supporters, it is difficult to  envisage them in opposition for another four years.    [Szombathy] Are we not threatened by the danger of the  country becoming ungovernable?    [Horn] From the country's point of view, it would be most  desirable if the Socialists and the possible liberal partners  acquired a two-third majority. This has a small chance but a 58  to 60 percent majority will definitely be needed. A two-third  majority would only have been possible if a social-liberal  election alliance had been formed months ago. The Fidesz's  behavior was the main obstacle to this. But I do not think that  the country will become ungovernable.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksandr Zhilin, MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI military observer, </F> report: "Fine Gesture, or General Staff Chief's Resignation?"]    [Text] The rumor that Colonel General Mikhail Kolesnikov,  chief of the Russian Federation Armed Forces General Staff,  allegedly presented his separation request to the president went  around Moscow last Friday. On Tuesday, a Moscow newspaper  reported it as a fait accompli, which caused confusion at the  Defense Ministry.    The Defense Ministry's press center has flatly denied the  information, calling it a provocation. What has actually  happened?    MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI has learned form sources close to the  president that Defense Ministry chiefs have long had differences  of views, particularly on how military reform should be carried  out. Far from all generals support Pavel Grachev's stance on the  matter. As a result, two camps have emerged in the ministry  leadership, both with their own doctrines of military  organization. As with Grachev's other opponents, Gen.  Kolesnikov is not a proponent of radical reform.    According to officials from the Defense Ministry central  staff, this stance has annoyed Pavel Grachev. Recently,  appointments to high posts at the General Staff were made  without Kolesnikov's consent. Other "working incidents" have  also been reported. Small wonder that the other day Kolesnikov  said in an outburst of emotion that if his opinion was not  heeded, he was ready to resign. It cannot be ruled out that  military bureaucrats interested in such a turn of events have  deliberately leaked the information to the press, adding by  themselves a finishing touch: Gen. Kolesnikov's separation  request is already sitting on Yeltsin's table.    Still, the source told MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI, it is possible  that there may indeed be only one step from an oral statement to  a written request. It is believed, however, that Boris Yeltsin  is unlikely to accept the resignation, because he sees  Kolesnikov as "a mighty counterweight to extreme reformers."    Come what may, Mikhail Kolesnikov has said in public that he  is not going to resign and that he is fully intent on honestly  performing his duties.</p>

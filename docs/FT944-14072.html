			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Hefty tax increases on the way Sir, When is a tax increase not a tax increase? Many financial commentators  -yourselves included - give the impression that the forthcoming Budget will be neutral. 'Mr Clarke has already ruled out significant tax cuts for this year, while the good performance of the economy this year rules out any further tax increases' (Editorial, 'Mr Clarke's Budget task', October 21). It is not surprising that the chancellor has ruled out tax cuts, given that he plans exactly the opposite - a further Pounds 6.5bn increase, announced in the last Budget. (The main measures are, of course, the imposition of VAT on fuel at the full rate, sharp rises in excise duties and further restriction of Miras and the married couple's allowance relief.) While the chancellor's desire to gloss over the fact that personal taxes will rise sharply again in 1995-96 is understandable, it is less clear why commentators should wish to do the same. When Mr Clarke confirms the rise, will the Financial Times report that the Budget contained no tax increases? Andrew Smith, chief economist, Credit Lyonnais Laing, London EC2A 2DA</p>

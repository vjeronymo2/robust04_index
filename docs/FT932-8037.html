			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / International Company News: US airline broadens European talks MR Bob Crandall, chairman of American Airlines, said yesterday the US carrier had held talks over possible partnerships with a number of European carriers, including Lufthansa, British Midland, Air France, SAS, and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines. Speaking after his company's annual meeting in Texas, Mr Crandall said: 'We haven't been able to structure a deal that makes sense for us and a European partner.' However, talks were continuing. Although talks in the past had covered equity investments, discussions under way now were more about marketing relationships, he said. Mr Crandall's comments come in the wake of a number of tie-ups between US and European carriers - including British Airways' purchase of a minority interest in USAir, KLM's integration with Northwest Airlines, and the partnership between Air Canada and Continental.</p>

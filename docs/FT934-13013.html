			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / Strong sales help Nokia turnround to FM466m NOKIA, the Finnish telecommunications group, yesterday unveiled a FM466m (Dollars 81.7m) pre-tax profit for the first eight months. Growing telecommunications and mobile phone sales helped the recovery from the FM277m loss in the same 1992 period. The group said it had reached an advanced stage in talks with other industry groups over a partnership covering the tubes and home electronics activities within its loss-making consumer electronics division. Stemming losses through rationalisation had proved insufficient due to depressed European markets, said Mr Jorma Ollila, Nokia's chief executive. He declined to reveal the partners involved but hoped an agreement could be reached within months. Telecommunications sales climbed 87 per cent to FM2.74bn and mobile phone sales jumped 83 per cent to FM3.68bn in the first eight months to push group sales up 42 per cent to FM14.16bn. Operating profits amounted to FM787m, compared with a FM152m loss last time. Margins improved within telecommunications and mobile phones compared with last year and profits in both divisions rose strongly. On the negative side, losses within consumer electronics were as large as in 1992 and financial expenses jumped to FM323m from FM130m, after exchange rate losses of FM172m. It forecast an operating profit of at least FM425m in the final four months with an improvement on last year's FM158m full-year pre-tax loss.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jorge Celis] </F>   [Text] The National Police public relations spokesperson  reports on last night's bomb scares. One of the bombs was  defused, and the other exploded at 12th Street and 19th Avenue  in Zone One.    [Begin unidentified spokesperson recording] Two bomb scares  were being handled. One was defused at 40th Street and 3d  Avenue in Zone Three, behind the quarters of the National Police  1st Brigade [words indistinct]. The other, a fragmentation  grenade, was thrown against a house. We cannot assume the last  one was part of the terrorist actions that have been taking  place in Guatemala City. We believe it could have been hurled at  a private home, but we do not know which one, perhaps by someone  who was inebriated. [end recording]</p>

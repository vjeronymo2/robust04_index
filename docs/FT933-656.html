			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / No backtracking on 'open skies' policy, says Brussels THE European Commission told the 12 EC member states and European flag airlines yesterday there would be no going back on the Community's 'open skies' regime, agreed last year to deregulate and promote greater competition in air transport. At a special meeting in Brussels last night where EC transport ministers discussed the financial crisis in civil aviation with industry representatives, Brussels stood on its EC treaty rights to police competition and took an uncompromising line. 'There is no question of backtracking, and I've made that absolutely plain,' said Mr Karel Van Miert, EC competition commissioner. 'What some of (the airlines) are after apparently is a price cartel,' he added, 'and that we cannot and will not allow. We won't accept a fare cartel or a capacity reduction cartel.' On the table at the meeting was a working paper from the Belgian presidency of the EC, calling for the reintroduction of passenger capacity-sharing between airlines, and suggesting for the first time EC funding for airlines in trouble and for air transport infrastructure. But a return to collusion on passenger quotas between airlines was ruled out by a big majority of member states, as was co-operation on price-setting. Mr Van Miert ruled out the possibility of EC funding. He remarked on 'a certain nostalgia' among airlines for the cosy, state-bankrolled cartels that existed before EC liberalisation. On the day that the French transport ministry announced it was earmarking FFr5bn (Pounds 581m) for a further recapitalisation of Air France, the troubled state-owned airline, Mr John MacGregor, the UK transport minister, said he was encouraged that all airline industry representatives at the meeting condemned state aids as adding to overcapacity. Mr Van Miert, who as transport commissioner until this year approved big cash injections into Sabena, the Belgian state carrier, Air France, and Iberia, the Spanish flag airline, reaffirmed the doctrine that these were 'last-chance' agreements. The Belgian Socialist commissioner said the criterion was that 'there has to be a credible plan for returning the company to viability', and that if those plans turned out badly, there would be no second chance. Mr Van Miert said pending rulings on state aids for Aer Lingus, Olympic Airways, and Air France, were the responsibility of the transport commissioner. Editorial Comment, Page 19</p>

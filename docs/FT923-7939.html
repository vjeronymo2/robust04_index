			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / International Company News: Luxury goods groups fight to hold sales FRANCE's prestigious drinks and cosmetics companies fought to maintain sales in a volatile market during the first half of this year, according to interim turnover figures announced yesterday. L'Oreal, the world's biggest cosmetics company, saw sales rise by 10.4 per cent to FFr19.93bn (Dollars 4.02bn) in the first six months of the year from FFr18.05bn during the same period of 1991. The group, which has a wide spread of cosmetics interests across the market, countered the weakness in the luxury sector with a recovery in duty free sales after the disruption caused by the Gulf War in the opening months of last year. Clarins, another force in French cosmetics, mustered an 18 per cent increase in first half sales from FFr878m to FFr1.03bn thanks to continued growth in its international markets. The revival in duty-free sales also benefited LVMH, one of the largest forces in luxury goods worldwide, which reported a modest 4.5 per cent increase in sales to FFr9.68bn for the first half. Perfume sales showed stronger growth of 24 per cent to FFr2.54bn, fuelled by the duty free recovery and the launch of Dune and Amarige. There was a 6.7 per cent fall in drinks turnover to FFr4.44bn chiefly due to depressed champagne sales. Two other leading French drinks groups, Pernod-Ricard and Remy-Cointreau, reported reduced turnover for the early part of the year. Pernod's interim sales slipped by 3.5 per cent to FFr6.88bn, although the fall was mainly due to the sale of Societe des Vins de France. Remy's first-quarter sales fell from FFr1.16bn to FFr1.04bn. Taittinger, the champagne maker, managed to increase interim sales by 38 per cent to FFr2.2bn despite the difficulties of the champagne market.</p>

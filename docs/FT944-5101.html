			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / EU ministers agree on loan for Ukraine: Ecu85m should pave way for balance of payments aid EU finance ministers yesterday sent a belated signal of support for the reformist government in Ukraine with an agreement in principle to provide an Ecu85m (Pounds 67m) loan. The EU loan should pave the way for an international rescue plan to fill the looming Dollars 1bn (Pounds 610m) gap in Ukraine's fourth quarter balance of payments, which threatened to re-ignite inflation and cut short energy imports this winter. The compromise in Brussels yesterday means the Ecu85m loan will be disbursed only after the International Monetary Fund completes negotiations on a Dollars 1.5bn standby loan to support the reform programme. It is also tied to closure of the Chernobyl nuclear plant, though Ukraine's promise to meet its debt arrears means that Ecu400m of EU should be released soon to help pay for the Kiev government's nuclear clean-up. The US and Germany lobbied hard for a deal in Brussels, arguing it was vital to bolster President Leonid Kuchma, a central planner turned economic reformer who campaigned for signing the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty France and the UK - which had previously held up an accord - fell into line after their partners agreed to impose tighter conditions on future EU macro-economic aid to third countries, with Ukraine being treated as an exceptional case. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor of the exchequer, told colleagues that the EU should not turn itself into a 'shadow IMF'. He called for clearer rules on EU lending to distressed countries, and a study is expected to be produced next year. Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister who chaired yesterday's meeting, overcame French reservations by forging a compromise on aid to Algeria. Ministers agreed with the Commission to provide a maximum Ecu200m to be released in two tranches to support structural reform in the north African state. Mr Waigel heralded the agreement as an important statement of European support for Mr Kuchma, who had embarked on a 'courageous and ambitious' reform programme. The decision on Ukraine yesterday must still go through the European parliament, and it leaves open the question of how much the EU will be ready to contribute next year to cope with expected balance of payments difficulties. But in the short term, it unlocks further funds from the US and other Group of Seven industrialised nations, including Japan. The US has already offered around Dollars 100m, with Canada offering Dollars 25m. Ministers also agreed to provide macro-economic aid of up to Ecu130m for Slovakia, to be released in two tranches to help with reform.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Foreign Policy" column by Mustafa Necati </F> Ozfatura: "To Defend Anatolia, First the Danube and the Sava  Must Be Protected"]    [Excerpt] The defense of Anatolia and particularly of the  straits in northeastern Turkey depends on the defense of the  Danube and of the Sava and Drau Rivers. Bosnia-Herzegovina,  Kosovo, Sandzak, Western Thrace, and Albania are our outposts in  the West. We must, in fact, it is our fate, to extend every  possible kind of material and moral support to the more than 10  million Muslims living in the Balkans.    Like the Balkans, Baku, Nagorno-Karabakh, Nakhichevan,  Abkhazia and the countries in northern Caucasus, the Adzhar  Republic, Crimea, Karkuk (Iraqi Turkmens), and Cyprus are  Turkey's outposts and areas of interest. Anatolia can be  defended only if these forts remain in the hands of the Muslims.    In fact, Anatolia is the real target of the games and  scenarios being played in the Balkans, the Caucasus, Crimea,  Cyprus, and northern Iraq. Throughout history, whenever  Anatolia was united and strong, the Islamic world had peace and  security. Whenever Anatolia was weakened and its unity  disrupted, not only was the entire Islamic world exploited by  imperialist forces, but it was also subjected to great suffering  as a result of massacres, genocide, and other cruelties.    Anatolia is the center of the Turkish and Islamic world.  Serbian martial music includes the slogan "Od Jadrana do Irana  nece biti Muslumana," meaning all the Muslims from the Adriatic  to Iran will be killed. This is not only the permanent wish of  the Serbs but of the West; it is the hatred of the Crusaders.  There is surely a reason behind the fact that the cultural  heritage of the Turkish-Islamic civilization is being rudely  destroyed while Christian works in Anatolia are being repaired.    The "holy alliance" the West established in Vienna was the  first stage of the plan to expel the Turks from the Balkans.  The last stage is to expel them from Anatolia.    Supporting the Balkans, the Caucasus, northern Iraq, Cyprus,  Crimea, and the others is necessary to protect Turkey's  existence today and in the future. It is certainly not a favor.

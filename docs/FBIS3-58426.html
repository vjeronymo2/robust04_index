			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] The debate on the no-confidence motion presented  against the government of [Carlo Azeglio] Ciampi is continuing  in the Chamber of Deputies. Let us link up with Francesco  Pionati.    [Pionati] Yes, the debate is taking place in a confused  atmosphere. At the end of this morning, Ciampi will go to the  Quirinale Palace [President's office] in order to hand his  resignation to the Head of State [Oscar Luigi Scalfaro], who  then has the task of dissolving the chambers and calling fresh  elections.    This morning the differences between the ruling coalition  parties, that want the legislature to continue -- a view  supported by [Savino Melillo] from the Liberal Party and by  [Enrico] Ferri from the Social Democratic Party who both spoke  this morning, and the opposition parties that, on the other  hand, want the chambers dissolved and elections to take place by  the end of March, became apparent once again. [passage omitted]    [Giorgio] Napolitano and Ciampi will be the last two to  speak  at the debate. At 1200, there will be a meeting of the  political groups making up the ruling coalition, which want to  propose a confidence motion in the government. However, this  proposal now seems out of the question. So all in all, the  debate is proceeding in this climate of confusion.</p>

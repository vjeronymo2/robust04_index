			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Fifth of seven question-and-answer talks sponsored by the </F> State Economic and Trade Commission and the State General  Administration of Taxation, chaired by Jiang Qiangui, director  of the State Economic and Trade Commission's Enterprise  Department: "Answers to Questions Regarding Enterprises'  Implementation of the New Tax System" -- recorded]    [Excerpts] [video begins with a wide shot showing two women  and three men seated in a row: Jiang Qiangui; Chen Jie, deputy  director of the State General Administration of Taxation's  Turnover Tax Department, who answers questions asked by the  moderator and other participants; Zhang Qipeng, chief accountant  of the Beijing Municipal Automobile Industrial Corporation; Liu  Jian, deputy director of the Beijing Medical Radiographic  Equipment Plant; and Wang Zhiyu of the Policy and Regulations  Section of the Ministry of Coal Industry]    [Jiang] Viewers, comrades: Today we are presenting the fifth  lecture of the "Answers to Questions Regarding Enterprises'  Implementation of the New Tax System." In this lecture, we will  mainly discuss consumption and resource taxes. Although  consumption taxes will only be levied on products of (?11) major  categories, they have drawn strong responses. Enterprises,  especially mining enterprises and other resources-exploitation  enterprises, are very concerned about resource taxes. Because  consumption taxes were proposed, many comrades have asked: Both  consumption and value-added taxes [VAT] are levied on some  products. Is this a kind of double taxation? Director Chen,  would you please explain this?    [Chen] First, I have to admit that this does involve double  taxation. Why does the new taxation system stipulate that  consumption taxes are to be levied on a small group of  commodities because VAT is levied on the production and sales of  all commodities? We call this method an integration of general  regulation and special regulation -- this method currently has  been adopted quite widely by many countries. From the viewpoint  of enterprises' production and business operations, under market  economic conditions, enterprises themselves should mainly decide  what and how they want to produce. The undesirable effects of  taxes and other economic polices on enterprises should be  minimized. [passage omitted]    Why do we have to add consumption taxes? Why do we permit  double taxation? First, we want to restrict the production and  consumption of some products; second, we want to place  restrictions on some products of which the supply has  outstripped the demand; third, we want to ensure that taxes on  some products will be considerably reduced within a specific  period. Incidentally, consumption taxes will be grouped into  two major categories in the future. The first category will be  routine, or fixed, taxes, such as those on cigarettes and  liquor, which will be limited by means of a special regulation.  The other category is [words indistinct], which may be  readjusted from time to time in the future, depending on the  economic development situation. [passage omitted]    [Jiang] Many people, especially mining enterprises and other  resources-exploitation enterprises, have expressed their  opinions about the resource taxes. Some of them have said after  the new system is instituted, it will be better to buy minerals  than to excavate them. Would you please give your opinion on  this?    [Chen] The new central taxation system still maintains its  function of regulating resources. However, there are some  differences in form. In the past, there was only one list of  taxation rates, which was applicable to all mining enterprises.  The new system provides two lists: The first one is the  Provisional Regulations on Resource Taxes, which were  promulgated by the State Council, and the other is an auxiliary  tax rates list which sets the lowest and highest tax rates for  each kind of mineral product. The State Council's regulations  contain stipulations concerning the tax rates for nearly all  kinds of products applicable to enterprises. But these  regulations are a basic law, so they do not provide specific  stipulations. [passage omitted]    [Wang] The resources tax rates are not very high and are  considered local taxes. But, according to the Constitution and  the Law on Mineral Resources, mineral resources belong to the  state. Because of what reasons does the State General  Administration of Taxation consider resource taxes to be local  taxes?    [Chen] Resource taxes are regarded as local tax revenues. To  be frank with you, the State General Administration of Taxation  did not make the decision. The Finance Ministry studied the  issue, and the central authorities made the decision.

			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Recession prompts Thwaites to seek buyers THWAITES, the Leamington Spa-based company whose sturdy dumpers are a familiar feature of UK construction sites, is exploring a possible sale of the company after a sharp fall in demand caused by the recession. Thwaites said yesterday that, following several approaches from parties interested in buying the company, it had asked Robert Fleming, the merchant bank, to advise shareholders and the company in connection with the possible sale. The company, formed in 1937 by the late Mr Basil Thwaites, has more than 50 per cent of the UK market for site dumpers from three quarter tonnes to eight tonnes payload, and like many in the industry has jealously guarded its independence. The recession, however, has caused its main market to contract by about 50 per cent. This, and approaches from a number of Far Eastern and continental European construction equipment manufacturers, had persuaded the family-owned company that now might be an appropriate time to sell. Yesterday the company and its advisers were stressing that the potential change of ownership was not a fire sale. Thwaites is in a sound financial condition and will remain independent with the full support of its present shareholders if acceptable terms cannot be negotiated. The announcement is likely to spark considerable interest in the construction equipment industry. 'It has a lot to offer: a nice facility with a very good engineering track record and a good product reputation round the world,' said Mr David Phillips, director of the Corporate Intelligence Group's Off-Highway Research Division. 'It could be a very good purchase for a Japanese or Korean company that wants a manufacturing presence in the European Community.' Mr John Webb, Thwaites managing director, said site dumpers were primarily a product for the UK market, and there was a limit to the extent that exports could be increased. Diversification with the launch in 1986 of the Alldig small backhoe loader had been hard going against the bottom end of JCB's range, and Thwaites' recently acquired Pegasus range of all-terrain access equipment had been hit by the market downturn despite being popular with users. Mr Webb said there were a number of German, French and Japanese manufacturers which did not have a good UK distribution base. There was also plenty of room for expansion at Leamington - a streamlined workforce of 170 is working in 160,000 sq ft of a 260,000 sq ft site. No financial details were available, but Fleming is sending details to potential purchasers worldwide.</p>

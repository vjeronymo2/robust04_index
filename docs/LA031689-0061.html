			<p><P> March 16, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> GOOD AND BAD DECISIONS ON COLLEGES  </P> <P> Two decisions by the Los Angeles Community College District Board of Trustees  were reported side by side (Feb. 13). One, rejecting a request to hold the San  Fernando Valley Fair on the Pierce College campus, was rational and politically  brave. The second, to begin construction on Mission College, was wasteful and  politically expedient.  </P> <P> We must face the fact that in 1947, when Pierce College was opened primarily as  an agricultural college, the land usage of the western San Fernando Valley was  decidedly different than it is today. Then it was rural, and much land was  devoted to agriculture. Today it is suburban residential and that same land is  devoted to clean industry. And though two-thirds of the campus acreage is given  over to the agriculture department, less than 5% of the Pierce College  enrollments are in agriculture. And most of those enrollments are in programs  unrelated to raising crops, such as floriculture, equitation (a fancy name for  horseback riding) or veterinary assistant.  </P> <P> The only defensible reason for devoting hundreds of valuable acres to the  agriculture department is its value as a showplace for elementary school kids.  If the acreage were converted into a real, working, small farm, it would  partially justify the immense expense devoted to very questionable educational  practice.  </P> <P> The construction of buildings for Mission College is a blatant case of throwing  good money after bad. The founding of Mission College was a needless concession  to a few minority leaders in the area. Pierce and Valley colleges are a short  drive from the area served by Mission College and they offer a much broader  curriculum. And if you doubt that there is space available at either Pierce or  Valley, stroll around the campus between 2 and 7 p.m. and note how many  students or faculty members you see.  </P> <P> During the late 1960s and 1970s, when there was a lot of money available to  colleges for the asking, the Los Angeles community college trustees needlessly  opened the West, Southwest and Mission campuses primarily to appease black and  Hispanic voters. The district has been spending the time since then trying to  justify these inane decisions. I call them inane because minority students want  to go to the best colleges they can, not the closest.  </P> <P> If the 4,800 mostly part-time students claimed by Mission College were  considered as the equivalent of full-time students, there would be well under  2,000. That's mighty few students on whom to spend tens of millions of dollars,  particularly when there is an excellent college less than five miles away  (Valley) and a second, equally good, about eight miles away (Pierce) in the  same Los Angeles district.  </P> <P> I look forward to the time when all college boards of trustees make decisions  based on sound educational practice rather than on political opportunism.  </P> <P> M.

			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Major pressed on Maxwell intelligence claims SENIOR Labour spokesmen yesterday demanded a full inquiry into the extent of the government's knowledge of Robert Maxwell's activities before the collapse of his business empire. Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow trade secretary, wrote to Mr John Major urging him to set up an inquiry. His letter follows yesterday's Financial Times report that the government was in possession of intelligence information at least two years before the death of Maxwell suggesting he had been acting dishonestly. Whitehall officials did not deny that Maxwell's telephone or other activities had been monitored. But they said there was no evidence to suggest that ministers had seen information which might have alerted them to fraud in the Maxwell empire. Mr Major was certain that he had seen nothing either as chancellor or prime minister. Mr Brown said he was seeking a statement on 'who was informed, when and in what detail, and - specifically - why no action was taken to investigate fraud and protect pension funds'. However, Miss Ann Widdecombe, junior social security minister, ruled out a fresh investigation and rejected calls for another Commons debate or government statement. 'It would be quite counter-productive to react every day to every new twist of the Maxwell saga,' she said on Channel Four News. Commenting specifically on the allegations in yesterday's FT, she said: 'The government has already made very clear statements to the effect that we do not believe that we have any responsibility for what happened.' Mr Richard Page, Conservative co-chairman of the all-party group of MPs campaigning on behalf of the Maxwell pensioners, said: 'If it turns out the government knew that Maxwell was bleeding money out of the pension funds, then the pressure on the government to provide for the pensioners becomes almost irresistible.' The FT yesterday quoted Mr Robin Robison, who in June 1988 became an administrative officer for the Joint Intelligence Committee, part of the Cabinet Office which assesses information from Britain's intelligence services. Last night Mr Peter Thompson, a former editor of the Sunday Mirror and director of Mirror Group Newspapers, said that a book he co-authored in 1988 was suppressed by Maxwell partly because it had originally claimed that the British security services had extensive files on the publisher. The FT has confirmed separately, from a source other than Mr Robison or Mr Thompson, that intelligence information on Maxwell's activities had been available for some years. A full intelligence report on Maxwell was prepared from files for the JIC at the time of his death on November 5 last year. Mr Robison - a Quaker who was positively vetted by the security services in 1987 - claimed that in 1989 he saw intelligence information on Maxwell from intercepted telephone conversations and faxes. The information, he said, had been distributed to Whitehall officials including the prime minister's office. Senior Whitehall officials disputed that Mr Robison could have seen signals intelligence information in autumn 1989, as he claimed. They said Mr Robison was moved from his JIC work in June 1989 to another post in the Cabinet Office. After that he had no further access to secret material. Downing Street indicated that there were no plans to seek a prosecution of Mr Robison under the Official Secrets Act. Mr Robison said last night he resigned from the Cabinet Office at the end of January 1990. He insisted he continued to have access to top-secret material after June 1989. There was no comment in Whitehall on the suggestion that intelligence services might have been routinely collecting information on the Maxwell empire. The government's policy is not to discuss the work of the security services, though it is acknowledged that commercial activities do fall within their remit. Discussing the suppression of the book he co-authored with Mr Anthony Delano, Mr Thompson said last night: 'Maxwell was particularly angry about a passage which detailed the files which MI5 had on him. I have no reason to believe that the information about the file and the dossiers was inaccurate.' According to Mr Thompson, Maxwell objected to a claim that a former MI5 agent saw no fewer than 37 assembled dossiers on the publisher. The book, Maxwell: A Portrait of Power, was published in February 1988. But Maxwell's lawyers obtained an injunction to prevent further sales and issued writs for defamation. After an out-of-court settlement the hardback copies were withdrawn and pulped. A paperback version published since Maxwell's death did not include the passages in question. In the Commons, Mr Michael Meacher, shadow social security secretary, questioned why, if the government had such information before 1989, the Department of Trade and Industry had nonetheless granted investment licences to two Maxwell companies, which he later used to pillage the pension funds. However, Miss Widdecombe said last night the crucial question was not to ask what had happened but how to prevent a repetition of the suffering of Maxwell pensioners. Asked whether the government would put pressure on Liechtenstein in the search for Maxwell funds, she said: 'The government will do what is appropriate as and when it believes action is necessary.'

Whenever this goal is not achieved, the recipient shall develop and submit a plan of action for addressing this shortfall. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) The recipient or subrecipient may contact private and public employers directly or through the State employment security agencies to develop or identify suitable unsubsidized employment opportunities; and should encourage host agencies to employ enrollees in their regular work forces. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) The recipient or subrecipient shall follow-up on each enrollee who is placed into unsubsidized employment and shall document such follow-up at least once within 3 months of unsubsidized placement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;641.315  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Maximum duration of enrollment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A maximum duration of enrollment may be established by the recipient in the grant agreement, when authorized by the Department. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;641.316  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Individual development plan-related terminations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> When an enrollee refuses to accept a reasonable number of referrals or job offers to unsubsidized employment consistent with his or her IDP and there are no extenuating circumstances, the enrollee may be terminated from the SCSEP.

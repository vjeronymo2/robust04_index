			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Companies): Unigate - Pick of Lex / A selection of comments from this week's FT Unigate's increase in its interim dividend was a tangible expression of the group's confidence in the future. The mild optimism contrasts with near panic before the new milk marketing regime took effect. Now that Milk Marque is two weeks old, price rises of 2p a pint appear to have stuck both in supermarkets and on the doorstep. The impact on Unigate's profitability is unlikely to be quite so dire as feared. Sensing this, shares in both Unigate and Northern Foods have risen sharply in the past fortnight. The stock market reaction, however, under-estimates the scale of the problems ahead. Unigate will not be able to recoup the full annual Pounds 40m increase in milk costs. Moreover, higher prices for home-delivered milk may accelerate the decline of this high-margin business. In the long run, Unigate will gain from sourcing more than half its milk from farmers operating outside Milk Marque. But, initially at least, this milk commands a premium price not yet offset by improvements in quality and reduced delivery costs. Unigate will obtain better prices if it acquires Dairy Crest, which would more than double its buying power. Unigate will respond to the strategic challenges by implementing swingeing rationalisation measures, giving rise to an exceptional charge far in excess of the expected Pounds 10m hit to operating profits. This should make the group fitter in the long term, but now the shares' main attraction is the 6.2 per cent prospective yield.</p>

			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / Alumasc rises 5% and makes building products purchase ALUMASC, the manufacturer of beer kegs, precision components and building products, yesterday announced an increase of 5 per cent in annual pre-tax profits and the acquisition of MR Holdings for an initial Pounds 6.4m. In the year ended June 30 1993 profits advanced from Pounds 7.2m to Pounds 7.55m, on turnover reduced to Pounds 44.9m, compared with Pounds 45.3m. Mr John McCall, chairman and chief executive, said the increase had been achieved without any improvement in economic conditions or large acquisition activity in the year. It was mainly through previous restructuring and earlier acquisitions to reduce dependence on the beer keg market, he said. MR, a privately-owned external wall insulation company, will bolster Alumasc's building products division. The acquisition will be funded initially by the issue of 730,000 shares, of which 552,000 are being placed with institutional and other investors, and Pounds 2.4m cash. Further profit-elated consideration is payable up to a maximum Pounds 2.25m cash. MR made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 1.1m from sales of Pounds 7.8m in the year to June 30 1993. Mr McCall said the acquisition would enhance the prospects of the building products division, where operating profits fell from Pounds 3.8m to Pounds 3.1m over the year. Difficult trading conditions in other parts of the group, such as Euroroof where sales declined 20 per cent to Pounds 7m, were offset by growing demand for new beer kegs and increased operating profits in the precision components division. Demand for kegs helped the container division increase operating profits by Pounds 860,000 to Pounds 2.5m, while operating profits in components rose 9 per cent to Pounds 1.66m. Mr McCall said the improvement in components was achieved in spite of problems associated with customers not taking up expected orders. Overall, the group's performance benefited from the lower cost base resulting from earlier rationalisation and redundancies, he added. The affect of these measures enabled the company to retain a net cash balance of Pounds 5.3m (Pounds 3.5m). Earnings per share rose to 33.9p (31.3p). The final dividend is 8.05p, bringing the total to 11.75p (11p). It is proposed to subdivide the 25p shares into 12 1/2 p to assist marketability. The shares were unchanged at 570p yesterday.</p>

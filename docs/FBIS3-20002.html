Security forces on an operation around the mountain in  eastern Turkey found a hide-out. Two SAM's were found at the  hide-out at the 13,000-foot (4,000 m) level.    Specialists say that the missiles were being used against  aerial targets.    The same hide-out contained an RPG-type missile launcher, 27  missiles, 43 rounds, 21 explosion moulds, a machine gun and a  great number of Kalashnikov bullets, medicine and documents.    In an exclusive interview, Interior Minister Nahit Mentese  confirmed the operation and said that security forces have been  carrying out intensive operations since March 4 in Kars, Igdir  and Agri.    `The importance of these operations are quite clear when you  consider the damage which could have been done by the SAM's,'  Mentese said.    Mentese also called on the terrorists to surrender.    `Let them surrender,' he said. `They have epidemics and  instead of dying on the mountains let them surrender to the  Turkish justice and benefit of the penitence law,' he said.    The SAM's have a 2-mile (3.6-km) range. The 20-pound (9-kg)  missiles are manufactured by Russia and China.</p>

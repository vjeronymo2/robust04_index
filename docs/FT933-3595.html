			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Steely determination It is easy to see why British Steel is anxious to move the European steel debate forward. Subsidies protect its state-owned competitors in Europe from the economic downturn, while depressed continental demand robs it of the benefits of rationalisation. The levy proposal, whereby privatised producers would contribute towards the cost of shutting down capacity at state-owned loss-makers, may appear unorthodox to competition policy purists, but British Steel can well afford to participate. The incentive to do so is all the greater since real discipline will be even harder to impose on subsidies once the recovery starts. The problem would then be worse again in the next downturn. Participation in the levy need not affect the company's low gearing. Contributions would come out of revenue over a period of five years. Given British Steel's high operational gearing, the effect on the profit and loss account would presumably be quickly offset by higher prices and higher volumes. Its relatively modest capital spending requirements mean the cash outlay should not hurt. The longer term risk is that once the west European capacity problem is resolved it will be harder for the EC to find an excuse for restricting cheap imports from eastern Europe. The short-term risk is that the discipline imposed on state-owned producers will prove inadequate. British Steel is, though, probably right to claim that, without action soon, the outlook for private sector producers is bleak. Most at risk are companies in Germany and Benelux which stand to suffer an exchange rate disadvantage from the collapse of the ERM. But any collapse there would be scant consolation since the Klockner experience shows that private sector troubles do not necessarily lead to closure of capacity.</p>

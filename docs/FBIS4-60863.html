			<p>BFN     [Text] Without giving reasons for his move, Azerbaijan's  President Heydar Aliyev fired his press service chief Tofig  Abasov.    One of Aliyev's staff workers told Interfax that Abasov was  unable to run the president's press service and that a cadre  reshuffle was coming.    There are several choices for the vacancy.    Tofig Abasov came to office under the patronage of  Azerbaijan's former Secretary of State Lala Gadjiyeva who was  made to resign late last year.    Last Friday Aliyev fired his Minister of Internal Affairs  Vaghif Novruzov.</p>

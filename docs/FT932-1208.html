			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / International Bonds: Swedish deal keeps Swiss franc sector active THE Swiss franc sector of the international bond market continued to attract considerable attention yesterday, with straight bond deals from the Kingdom of Sweden and De Nationale Investeringsbank, the Dutch banking group. Dealers said interest in the sector reflected the attractive swap rates available to borrowers and the relative strength of the Swiss franc, which is drawing new investor demand. The Kingdom of Sweden's SFr500m, 10-year bond issue was swapped into US dollars to give funding at fractionally above Libor. Sweden has been borrowing in a range of currencies recently, but yesterday's deal was its first issue in the Swiss franc sector since 1988. Credit Suisse, lead manager, said the yield of 4.75 per cent compared favourably with a yield of 4.52 to 4.55 on 10-year Swiss government bonds. One rival house described the deal as 'priced rather tightly', although the market seemed fairly confident the deal would be placed with time. The other area of the market to see a fair amount of activity was the US dollar sector. Comunidad de Madrid launched a Dollars 250m, five-year issue, marking the first time a Spanish regional government borrower has tapped the dollar sector. The deal was priced to yield 59 basis points over the Treasury bond, but the spread tightened to 55.5 basis points. Kyushu Electric Power Co, the Japanese privately-owned public utility, also tapped the Eurodollar sector with a Dollars 350m, 10-year issue. The deal, which yielded 45 basis points over the Treasury bond at launch, was described by dealers as 'fairly-priced'. Wharf Capital International, the Hong Kong company, raised Dollars 350m with a seven-year convertible bond issue, having increased the size of the deal from Dollars 300m to meet strong investor demand. The coupon was set at 5 per cent, with a conversion price of HKDollars 24.89, giving a conversion premium of 22 per cent. By late afternoon the bonds traded at 100.75-101.25, having been launched at par.</p>

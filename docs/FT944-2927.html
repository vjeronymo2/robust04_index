			<p>941215 FT  15 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Compco at Pounds 366,585 Compco Holdings, the property company, achieved pre-tax profits of Pounds 366,585 in the half year to September 25, compared with losses of Pounds 198,149 last time after an exceptional Pounds 550,003 charge relating to one of its joint venture properties. Net rental income was little changed at Pounds 919,714 (Pounds 919,977). Operating expenses, however, increased to Pounds 314,535 (Pounds 268,967) mainly because of fees incurred in reorganising group borrowings and joint ventures, the company said. In December the property at Millharbour, London Docklands, was sold for Pounds 1.43m, some Pounds 175,000 less than book value, which would be reflected in the second half. Earnings per share came through at 11.32p (9.58p losses).</p>

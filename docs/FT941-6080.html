			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Workaholic and proud of it I read with interest John Raymond's plea for workaholism status (Letters: February 23). Like Mr Raymond, I claim that title; unlike Mr Raymond I scored highly in your self-assessment test. Indeed, I probably gain bonus points for taking time off on a 'workaholic's holiday', a two-year MBA in the heart of workaholism land, New York. However, it seems Mr Raymond's argument misses the point - if he limits his industrious efforts to 'normal working hours' he must surely qualify only as a hard worker, not a workaholic. Someone who 'only' drinks for the entirety of pub opening hours (even if they be from 11am to 11pm) is clearly exhibiting extremist tendencies. Perhaps using his 'opening hours' analogy is a more accurate parallel than the 'alcoholic' comparison. Incidentally, after 18 months here, I have still to find a bar that serves that elusive liquor, workahol. Perhaps your readers could direct me.

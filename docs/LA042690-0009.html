			<p><P> April 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE BUTCHER: BOOK, VIDEO WEIGH IN WITH TASTY DIET RECIPES  </P> <P> We are inundated these days with diet programs, diet supplements, diet systems  -- all promising some magic weight loss something or other.  </P> <P> However, there is one weight loss program that I can recommend. Experts from  the Cleveland Clinic Foundation and chef Jacques Pepin have joined forces to  produce "A Fare that Fits," a cookbook/video package that features recipes that  taste good, leave you feeling full and yet are low in fat and calories.  </P> <P> "The secret to losing weight -- and keeping it off -- is not in miracle diets  but in a gradual weight loss of one to two pounds per week," says Karen  Miller-Kovach, assistant director of nutrition services at the foundation.  </P> <P> Pepin, cookbook author and personal chef to three French presidents, developed  the 60 recipes in the cookbook. The selections range from casual snacks to  elegant meals. Menus were developed to contain no more than 30% of the calories  from fats, and all recipes are designed to meet the U.S. Dietary Guidelines for  Healthy Americans.  </P> <P> Nutritional information has been translated into acceptable dietary guidelines  by Miller-Kovach, who helped Pepin make flavorful, filling, low-calorie cooking  a reality.  </P> <P> To make the following Pepin dish, buy whole turkey breasts and cut the steaks  yourself, or ask the butcher to do it. If the steaks are one-half-inch thick,  follow the cooking instructions below. Reduce the cooking time if they are  thinner, however, and cook them longer if they are thicker. The sauce, finished  with grapes and currants, is flavorful and lends itself to a party setting.  </P> <P> After the turkey is sauteed, it can be kept for at least one-half hour in a  200-degree oven or for one hour in a 180-degree oven. Any juices that emerge  during cooking may be added to the sauce.  </P> <P> </P> <P> TURKEY STEAKS WITH GRAPE AND CURRANT SAUCE  </P> <P> (From "A Fare That Fits")  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons olive oil  </P> <P> 6 (6-ounce) turkey breast steaks, cut about 1/2-inch thick  </P> <P> 2/3 cup chopped onion  </P> <P> 1 cup chopped leeks  </P> <P> 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar  </P> <P> 1/4 cup red wine vinegar  </P> <P> 1 1/2 cups Poultry Brown Base Sauce  </P> <P> 2 cups seedless green grapes  </P> <P> 1/4 cup dry currants  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon salt  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons chopped chives for garnish  </P> <P> Heat oil in heavy skillet over high heat. When hot, add turkey steaks and cook  2 to 3 minutes. Turn and continue cooking another 2 to 3 minutes. Remove while  still undercooked, transfer to gratin dish and place in 200-degree oven.  </P> <P> Add onion and leeks to skillet and saute 2 minutes. Add vinegars and cook until  almost evaporated. Add Poultry Brown Base Sauce, grapes, currants, salt and  pepper. Boil 2 to 3 minutes, until sauce thickens slightly. Add any juices that  have accumulated around turkey steaks in oven.  </P> <P> Arrange turkey steaks on platter, cover with sauce and sprinkle with chives.  Makes 6 servings.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Poultry Brown Base Sauce  </P> <P> 1 (14 1/2-ounce) can chicken broth  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon cornstarch  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon corn water  </P> <P> Reduce chicken broth to 1 cup. Add cornstarch mixed with water.  </P></p>

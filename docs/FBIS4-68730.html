			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "In a Minute of Distressing </F> Reflections"]    [Text] "I am not the first warrior, I am not the last,  Russia will be sick for a long time," wrote Aleskandr Blok  sometime during a moment of doubt, a moment of distressing  reflections about Russia's fate. Today, almost 100 years later,  reflections and doubts are no less distressing, but thanks to  the development of the social sciences we, as opposed to the  poet, can express them in a more strict, more scientific form:  "Having lost the status of a superpower, Russia moved swiftly  into the ranks first of all of the developing and now of the  regressing countries. It is possible that the danger of global  military conflict does not threaten us, but internal  instability, chaos, economic ruin and the psychology of losers  comprise no fewer threats to national security."    This quotation, having a clearly apocalyptic character, was  taken from the work "The National Doctrine of Russia (Problems  and Priorities)" which was prepared by the not unknown  "RAU-Corporation." [For a translation of excerpts from this  work, see the FBIS Report; Central Eurasia, Number  FBIS-USR-94-047 dated 4 May 94]. Despite some painful prognoses  (the transformation of inflation into galloping hyperinflation,  gorwth of prices, fall of production, corruption of society,  increase in crime, demographic regression, danger of a social  explosion, etc.)the book also contains, frankly speaking, some  unusually optimistic ideas. It is true that these are more  general in character: "Russia is a great country with a great  history, a difficult present and a great future. We believe  that the approaching 21st century is the century of Russia." At  first glance these prognoses about the near future cancel out  these hopes for a kingdom of Freedom, Peace, Spirituality and  Democracy. But this is only at first glance.    In recent times one often hears the opinion that the  situation in Russia cannot be forecast. According to all  appearances, the very term "non-forecastable  [neprognoziruyemost]" can, from a historical point of view, be  understood as "it will be so lousy that there is nothing to even  talk about." Such a position is accessible to many, although it  is not very constructive. The authors of the "National  Doctrine," in no way closing their eyes to today's problems, not  only try to predict the situation, but also offer some  short-term goals which may be general, but nonetheless help us  to see a picture of civil peace and harmony. "As soon as a  strong and responsible government is consolidated Russia will  once again become a center of attraction."    The reestablishment of Russia as a specific world, as a  specific civilization, one of the subjects of world  history--this is the goal for our country. And the main task of  the patriotic movement is to avoid spontaneity, which can direct  the development of our country into the channel of reaction.  Today, in the opinion of the book's authors, we should turn our  attention to those factors which unite us: The Motherland and  the state.    One more quotation: "The main thing today is to prevent the  weakening and e disintegration of the state. It is impossible  to do this only by the traditional administrative-state or  financial methods: for Russia this is small. We must resurrect  the Russian idea which forms the basis of unity and the natonal  doctrine which represents the goals and tasks for developing  society recognized by the majority..."    "The National Doctrine" is not dogma, but an invitation to  discussion. Reactions to the conclusions of the authors'  collective, of course, will be extremely varied. The work  itself is intended for those people who draft and make political  decisions--first of all for deputies of the Federation Council.  But not only for them.    The new economic structures created as a result of market  transformations are more and more actively being included in the  political life of society. And this is understandable: their  activity, earlier based on purely economic factors depends to an  ever greater degree today on those processes which are taking  place in spheres not directly connected with business. The  possibility of forecasting, of predicting events, is extremely  important for them, especially under the conditions of political  and economic instability. It is no accident that many  entrepreneurs, without any apparent benefits for themselves, are  cooperating with scientists. Thus the latest work of the "RAU  Corporation" was partially financed by a private company. The  TOO [limited liability partnership] "Group MOST" paid for the  preparation and publication of the "National Doctrine of  Russia." It required 180 million rubles in order for this book  to see the light of day.    In the words of the leader of "Group MOST's" analytic  service  Ye. Ivanov, the sponsors do not completely share some of the  ideas and suggestions of the "National Doctrine." First of all  the idea of the economic basis of the doctrine gives rise to  criticism. In Ivanov's opinion it has a one-sided character. No  constructive alternative is provided in the criticism of the  ideas and practices of monetarism. There is no new "model" of  social-economic progress.    The section "Military Security and the Military Policy of  Russia" received particular criticism. History shows that it is  better not to have enemies than to fight with them...    Nonetheless the leadership of "Group-MOST" sees this work as  "an interesting and necessary attempt to delineate and to a  well-known degree work out a set of problems, without which  thought it will be impossible to move ahead."    As regards the authors of the "National Doctrine", in the  words of the leader of the authors' collective A.I. Podberezkin  "the RAU-Corporation responded with pleasure to the suggestion  of Group MOST on writing this work. "If there are new orders in  the future we are ready to fulfill them--that is our work."    Someone, probably I.A.[Joseph] Brodsky said that if we  elected a government according to their reading experience, and  not their political program, there would be fewer ills on earth.  It seems that this statement is just, to a certain degree, and  in our case the experience gathered in the book "The National  Doctrine of Russia" should help our society avoid many  convulsions and cataclysms peculiar to it in the past.</p>

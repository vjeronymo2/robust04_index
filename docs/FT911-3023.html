			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Sentiment mixed as Frankfurt tests its 1991 highs BOURSES put in a mixed performance yesterday as Germany closed at new highs for the year to date while France slipped at the finish. Milan and Portugal were closed, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT tested its highs yet again. Morgan Stanley raised its weighting in Germany by two percentage points to 17.5 per cent, lifting the market, but sentiment was not uniform. At midsession, the FAZ index was 8.00 better at 686.92, a new closing 1991 high. The DAX index closed 16.72 higher at 1,620.45; an intraday high of 1,626.95 took it temporarily into new territory, against a closing 1991 high of 1,623.83. Volume rose from DM6.1bn to DM7.8bn. Mr Andrew Bell, European equity strategist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, said that a DAX index closing 20 points outside its trading range for the past three months had not made a fundamental change in the market. However, he thought that the main risks for Germany - higher interest rates and the sharp slowdown in growth - threatened its neighbours almost as much as Germany itself, and that the speed of recovery in the US and other English speaking economies may be more important to German equity prospects than continental and domestic concerns. The big international blue chips, Siemens, Daimler and Deutsche Bank, all made good rises yesterday. Interest remained in steels and engineering with Thyssen rising DM6.40 to DM233.90 and Preussag DM8.50 to DM333. Retailers also featured, as Kaufhof rose DM12 to DM514.50 after its Kaufhalle subsidiary reported first quarter sales up 22 per cent. In specialist chemicals, Degussa, oversold according to Dresdner Bank, rose DM8 to DM346. AMSTERDAM ended higher thanks to a firm dollar and a strong bond market but trading was light. Dealers said activity was slowing ahead of next Tuesday's public holiday. The CBS tendency index added 0.5 to 96.0. The chemical group, Akzo, closed a net Fl 3.40 higher at Fl 115.70, ex a dividend of Fl 5, consolidating its gains after surprisingly good first quarter results. Nedlloyd, the transport group, went against the market to close 70 cents lower at Fl 50.60. The VEB, a group protecting the interests of small investors, said it would be voting against the endorsement of the 1990 accounts at the annual meeting on May 30. The group also said it supported Mr Torstein Hagen's bid to gain management power at Nedlloyd. Mr Hagen controls 23 per cent of Nedlloyd. PARIS was flat for most of the day and then shed five points at the close as Wall Street weakened. The CAC 40 index closed 5.02 lower at 1,777.01 in unimpressive volume of FFr1.65bn. Euro Disney was the day's most active stock, falling FFr1.90to FFr115 with 431,900 shares traded on reports that a dispute between two companies helping build the amusement park outside Paris could disrupt part of the park's construction. Euro Disney later said that the dispute would not delay the completion of the project. Lyonnaise-Dumez tumbled FFr28 or 4.5 per cent to FFr590 with 194,330 shares traded on disappointment at the merged group's 1990 results announced late on Wednesday. Analysts said the capital gains shown were lower than expected and that expectations for the current year were not encouraging. Poor first quarter results from its Canadian subsidiary United Westburne also weighed on the price. The company is holding an analysts' meeting this morning. ZURICH declined in light trading, the Credit Suisse index closing 1.5 lower at 554.2. CS Holding, parent of Credit Suisse, came under pressure for the second consecutive day and was the most active stock on rumours of a dividend cut and rights issue; the shares fell another SFr80 to SFr2,030. OSLO was buoyed up by better-than-expected results from Norsk Hydro and news that the Labour government planned to let the state pension fund invest in industry. The all-share index closed up 8.88 or 1.9 per cent to 475.01 in turnover worth NKr270m. Norsk Hydro jumped NKr7.5 to NKr190 on a drop of a quarter in first quarter net income, mainly as a result of the stronger dollar. MADRID slipped in the afternoon session, and the general index closed down 2.10 at 279.22. ISTANBUL's market index fell 39.3 to 4,134.36, taking its fall to over 246, or 5.6 per cent since it came back from an extended holiday on Wednesday.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                   FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - APR 25  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                          Hourly changes  Open     10 am    11 am    Noon     1 pm     2 pm     3 pm     Close 1120.84  1121.88  1123.91  1124.63  1124.39  1125.04  1123.49  1122.55  ----------------------------------------------------------------------            Day's High   1126.31        Day's Low   1120.84         Apr 24      Apr 23        Apr 22     Apr 19     Apr 18         1119.18     1122.04       1112.13    1122.00    1124.98  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

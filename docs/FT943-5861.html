			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / Survey of Kansai (7): Consolidation is the likely cure - Pharmaceuticals in crisis Along the narrow bicycle-lined street of Dosho-machi, in the Chuo-ku district of Osaka, are located some of Japan's biggest drugs companies. By western standards, the headquarters are modest, lacking in ostentation. That is partly Japanese corporate style, but more significantly it reflects the failure of these companies, and their Tokyo counterparts, to compete on a global basis. Japanese drugs groups' sales growth is slowing; pre-tax profits for many companies are forecast to decline; and their strength by comparison with their western counterparts continues to deteriorate. The industry needs to restructure. Companies do not have sufficient sales to finance the R&amp;D essential to ensure long-term survival. When the industry does eventually rationalise, the process will probably involve a consolidation of drugs companies into larger groups, with those in Tokyo merging with their local counterparts, and those Osaka-based businesses in Kansai linking up with their neighbours. Those located in Osaka include Takeda, Shionogi and Fujisawa. These are among the largest drugs groups in Japan. Indeed, Takeda is Japan's largest pharmaceuticals manufacturer. Yet in world terms, the Osaka-based companies  -as well as the Tokyo-based groups - are pharmaceutical pygmies. Only Takeda, is rated in the world top 20 drugs groups by sales, and only four Japanese pharmaceuticals companies are in the top 30. The reason is their failure to internationalise. In spite of some small-scale and mostly disastrous overseas acquisitions, and occasional investment in US and European development activities, the Japanese remain dependent on their domestic market. Only four groups generate more 10 per cent of their sales overseas. Dependency on domestic sales has been all the more debilitating because of the dire state of the Japanese market. The government, cash-strapped by falling tax receipts during the recession and appalled by demographic trends that indicate nearly a quarter of the population will be over 65 by the year 2025, has attempted to cut health-spending by attacking the drugs bill. These efforts have included demand-side controls, as well as price cuts. The combined consequences of the groups' lack of scale and the biennial price cuts are immense. It means the Japanese spend less than their western counterparts on R&amp;D, and what they do spend is often misdirected. Admittedly, the industry spends a respectable proportion of sales on R&amp;D; but because the groups' sales base is so small, the actual amounts available remain pitiful compared with western organisations. These meagre amounts might possibly be enough to assure survival, if they were spent appropriately. But much R&amp;D investment is misdirected. Kunio Takeda, president of Takeda Chemical, explains that in order to counter the price cuts: 'Manufacturers resorted to launching modified (non-innovative) compounds to conserve development costs and time. Such policies are likely to damage the industry.' This led to a massive rise in the number of new chemical entities developed in Japan in recent years. The increase was mistaken by some observers as an explosion in innovative research. Between 1975 and 1989, Japanese companies launched 212 new chemical entities. Few of these were innovative enough to be used overseas. Given the Osaka-based groups' proximity to each other, consolidation would, in theory, not be too arduous. Mergers tend to occur in Japan only when companies are in crisis. Admittedly, no Japanese drugs group is losing money, but the crisis assailing them is no less real. Drugs companies' directors must swallow their pride, consolidate their industry, refocus R&amp;D, and internationalise. The alternative is permanent marginalisation.</p>

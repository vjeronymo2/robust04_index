			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / G7 help waits on Russian elections The Group of Seven leading industrialised countries have prepared a battery of support measures for Russian reform, which will be activated after the election on December 12 - assuming the reformists win. A senior US official said yesterday in Moscow: 'Clearly, after the elections there will be major opportunities to consolidate progress and we can say that the G7 are poised to help and to help rapidly, if the conditions are there.' Support for reform in Russia depends heavily on the poll's outcome. Opinion surveys indicate dwindling support for Russia's Choice, the leading party and main reformist group, and a rise in support for the Communists and far right. The initiatives now being prepared for after the elections by the G7 include: A waiving by the World Bank for the first time of its 'negative pledge' rule, which means dropping its insistence that a country repay the bank before other creditors. The board is expected to approve the decision on December 14, two days after the election. The senior official said this would release a flood of investment held up during long discussions within the bank on dropping its time-honoured rule. The first fruit of this is a framework agreement designed by the US Eximbank to provide loans of Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.3bn) or more to Russian buyers in the oil and gas industries of US equipment, the loans secured against hard currency payments to escrow accounts for future oil and gas deliveries. This form of agreement, essentially a type of barter, would not be possible under the bank's negative pledge rule. Mr Thomas Pickering, US ambassador, said yesterday the agreement was the base for further foreign investment in energy and other fields. 'There must be no doubt of the desire on the part of US industry to play the leading role in extending assistance to Russia in the exploitation of its oil wealth.' A meeting of the G7 'sherpas', or senior civil servants, in Paris in the week after elections to review progress in reforms and prepare further assistance. Included in the future aid is a Dollars 3bn fund designed to support privatised companies with investment and advice, and the second Dollars 1.5bn tranche of the International Monetary Fund's systemic transformation facility, delayed for some months as reform veered off track. Visits to Moscow immediately after the election by US Vice President Al Gore and in January by President Bill Clinton for a summit with President Boris Yeltsin. The US official said: 'In spite of everything, 1993 has been a good year for Russian economic reform: real wages went up three times in dollar terms, inflation has come down from 30 to 15 per cent a month, privatisation has meant that one third of the workforce now works in the private sector. And 1994 could be a decisive year for Russia.' However, much depends on the outcome in the fourth quarter of the year. Reuter adds: Two Russian opposition parties were given the green light yesterday to fight the election. The central electoral commission rejected a request from Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, first deputy prime minister, to ban the Communist party and a centrist Democratic Party of Russia from the polls.</p>

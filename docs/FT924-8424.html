			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / Arts: A Month in the Country Why Turgenev's A Month in the Country is not given here more often is a mystery. Frederick Ashton's one-act ballet version has been a staple of Covent Garden repertory since 1936, and deservedly so - but Turgenev's five-act original is more marvellous yet. We have seen Lynn Seymour, Natalia Makarova, Antoinette Sibley, Altynai Asylmuratova and others dance Natalia Petrovna - but why have not Vanessa Redgrave or Maggie Smith acted her? Natalia is a sophisticated 29-year-old wife who discovers love for the first time in the person of her son's tutor, Beliaev, a 21-year-old student. She is a quasi-comic Phaedra - torn between duty and erotic impulse, twice caught in a compromising position with the wrong man. This 'wrong man' - her 30-year-old devoted admirer, Rakitin - is the play's most original character of all, an intelligent, honourable but ultimately forceless man who embodies the effete chivalry of the old gentry. The many conflicting loves and affections are interwoven with an acute social sense. Isaiah Berlin has written that the play 'seems to me more radical in tone, to contain more social protest, than any play by Ostrovsky or Chekhov, for all the explicit social content of their dramatic works.' And the plot is surrounded by a wealth of naturalistic detail that reflects Turgenev's mastery of fiction and places A Month in the Country between Chekhov and Balzac. The new Watford staging, directed by John Dove, rattles through the play with great ease. Few of its deeper psychological and social undercurrents become apparent; several of the pointers to characterisation in the text have not yet been realised. This is not a staging that brings new light on the play and too much has been cut or surpressed to ensure that it lasts just two hours and a half. Yet it proceeds so fluently that it holds its audience. And its rapid fluctuation of mood and emotion is absorbing. Emily Morgan is a febrile and volatile Natalia who really does seem 29 years old. There is more constant conflict within the role than she yet shows; she does not catch the qualities of laziness, basic good sense or sophistication that the play's characters credit her with. But she is always so natural in all she does do that you hang gratefully on her every line. A pity that John McMurray - though his three sets are simple and elegant - has attired her in near-dowdy costumes. Jonathan Coy, though too old to convince as a 30-year-old, catches the futility of Rakitin; but not his exquisite irony, or the way his silence should dominate the final interview with Natalia's husband. As the doctor, Shpigelsky - the play's third great role - Philip Witchurch has the right unconventional cynicism (though without the brusque joviality with which, in 1975-76, Timothy West made this character so astonishing). The most complete performance is that of Kate Byers as Vera. She has not yet caught all the despair Vera feels on resigning Beliaev, she is wonderfully artless and transparent; and the way she suddenly grows up is both startling and convincing. Joe Duttine is ideally fresh and simple as Beliaev and the way that David Sibley underlines Islayev's jealousy is the most original feature of this staging. At the Palace Theatre, Watford until November 28</p>

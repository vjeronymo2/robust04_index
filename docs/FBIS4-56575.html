			<p>BFN     [Text] Cuba's President Fidel Castro arrived in Barbados  last evening to attend a high-level session of the United  Nations Global Conference on Small Island Developing States,  SIDS. As we hear from this dispatch by (Nublen Brewster), the  arrival of this controversial leader has caused quite a stir.    [Begin Brewster recording] Scores of journalists waited  outside the [name indistinct] Civil Airport from as early as  1900. An hour and a half later, Cuba's President Fidel Castro,  resplendent in his customary army green uniform, alighted from a  Cubana airline. Flanked on either side by his personal  interpreter and several [word indistinct] bodyguards, he greeted  Cuba's resident ambassador, (Lazaro Cabeza), and Barbados  Foreign Minister Bainford Taitt.    Then he spoke to an anxious press corps who struggled with  Cuban and U.S. security guards to capture his first words on  tape. Some of us were shoved, even trampled, as the security  officials tried to keep voracious journalists at bay.    Speaking through his interpreter, [words indistinct],  President Castro said he is pleased to be in Barbados again. He  had stopped here more than 20 years ago while on his way to  another [word indistinct] summit. He was then quickly escorted  to a waiting Mercedes. We shadowed him and his interpreter to a  plush [word indistinct] hotel. [end recording]</p>

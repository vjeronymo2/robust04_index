			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Food and Drink: What happened to taste? - Jancis Robinson is scornful of the wine world's trend in technotalk Every year at about this time Peter A. Sichel, one of Bordeaux's more urbane wine producers, organises a London tasting of his wares (which includes Chateaux Palmer, d'Angludet and a host of more commercially conceived liquids). A member of the Anglo/French/Scandinavian branch of a family whose origins in the wine business go back to mid-18th century Germany, he has a broader view of the wine world than many. Based in Margaux, a village famous for the subtlety of its wines, he has expressed exasperation with what he perceives as an infatuation, on the part of wine buyers and commentators, with big, full-bodied, obvious wines. His note accompanying this year's invitation, however, highlights a new trend among wine commentators, if not quite (yet) in wine commentary. He says: 'There have been gnomes making wine in Bordeaux for some 2,000 years, but they have generally been confined to the cellars, allowed out only once a year in order to declare that the most recent vintage is the best they have ever produced, before being returned to obscurity for another 12 months. 'We have learned that modern communications require that they reveal at least some of their science. We have four highly proficient wine makers in our company, so we are bringing them all to London for our annual tasting.' He is no fool, this man. He is pandering, in the least servile way possible, to the fact that over the past two or three years wine writers have become increasingly besotted with what one might call the technotalk of wine. People who, in the main, were only too proud of their innumeracy, or their grade nine in physics O-level, now pin oenologists against the winery wall and quiz them for hours on end about fermentation temperature gradients, clone numbers, yeast strains, and the exact proportions of free-run juice versus what came out of the Willmes - or was it Bucher? - press. Oh, and what setting was the press on? I know this, because I do it myself. What has come over us all? We can use only a fraction of this information in print but, collectively, we seem to be suffering an epidemic of Need To Knowness, rather like the general newsgathering climate in the US after Watergate. Not that there has been a Winegate. We are doubtless acting under the influence of all those highly trained New World technicians who have the inclination to substitute technotalk for an evocation of personal philosophy, and the need to substitute it for historical anecdote. It does sometimes help to know, for example, what the total acidity of a wine is, but in most cases what is important is how acid it tastes, for which no technotalk is needed. Watch this space for a return to the mid 20th century school of wine writing evoked by such book titles as Wayward Tendrils of the Vine and Stay Me With Flagons.</p>

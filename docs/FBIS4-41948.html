			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["News Release"] </F>   [Text] Prime Minister Mart Laar said at a government  briefing on Tuesday that his Isamaa (Fatherland) Party was there  to remain despite evident break-up within. "Isamaa's separation  into different directions is saddening and profits no one," Laar  said while adding that the party was there to stay as the number  of its supporters had at places increased.    Isamaa has been in a crisis for around eight months and the  debate has fuelled after the Conservatives left on Monday.  Estonian press on Tuesday predicted that the Republicans were  to follow leaving Laar only with his Christian Democrats.  Isamaa was formed on the basis of four parties: the Republican  Coalition Party, the Conservative Peoples Party, the Christian  Democratic Union and the Christian Democratic Party whose close  cooperation before general elections in September 1992 brought  them to power.    A solution to the crisis was expected to be reached at party  congress on June 11 which brought victory to Laar who was re-  elected as chairman beating Republican Ulo Nugis (parliamentary  speaker) and Conservative Kaido Kama (former Justice Minister).    Laar said on Tuesday he intended to decide whether to remain  premier in August or September.</p>

			<p><P> June 2, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UNO NAMED HEAD OF JAPANESE PARTY AS REBELLION FAILS  </P> <P> The ruling Liberal Democratic Party overcame an attempted uprising by young  rebels today and chose Foreign Minister Sosuke Uno, 66, as its new party  president.  </P> <P> Parliament is to elect him as prime minister this afternoon after Noboru  Takeshita officially submits his resignation.  </P> <P> Uno pledged to carry out political reform, declared he would resign from the  party faction formerly headed by scandal-tainted ex-Prime Minister Yasuhiro  Nakasone and said he wanted to resolve trade frictions with Washington.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Allies Trust Each Other'  </P> <P> In a news conference after the caucus, Uno said he told three U.S. Cabinet  secretaries that "Japan and the United States are allies. Allies trust each  other in all matters. That is what an alliance is. . . . Raising a club to  conduct negotiations is simply not permissible."  </P> <P> Uno said he made the complaints about Japan being branded "an unfair trading  nation" when he met the U.S. officials in Paris earlier this week at a meeting  of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, where he learned  that party leaders had chosen him to succeed Takeshita.  </P> <P> The change of the guard -- precipitated by an 11-month-long series of  revelations of a $7.7-million influence-buying scandal -- was marred by six  objections from the floor of a party caucus meeting. Each protested the party's  refusal to permit a formal vote.  </P> <P> The young rebels Thursday tried to field Ganri Yamashita, 68, a former Defense  Agency director, as a rival to Uno, but the party leaders refused to accept his  candidacy. Rules for elections are spelled out for party conventions, but no  provisions exist for a vote between rivals in a caucus.  </P> <P> One of the rebels, Katsuhiko Shirakawa, condemned the refusal to allow an  election as a rejection of democracy's most basic principle.  </P> <P> "Could such a thing happen in Japan?" he asked.  </P> <P> Hideo Usui lambasted what he called the party's "incomprehensible method of  operations."  </P> <P> "If there is no rule to permit a vote at a party caucus, one should be  created," he declared.  </P> <P> Kuro Matsuda criticized the absence of any policy considerations in choosing  Uno.  </P> <P> "I haven't heard a thing about what policies Uno will follow as prime minister.  I have never heard Uno say a word about political reform," he told the  gathering, which was televised nationally.  </P> <P> "You choose a leader by a phone call to Paris, asking him, 'Won't you become  prime minister?' What the hell is this? The people won't accept it," Matsuda  said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> With a Stony Face  </P> <P> During the highly unusual outbursts, which the party leadership permitted in  place of a vote, Takeshita sat on stage with a stony face, while other party  leaders stared at the ceiling or looked down at documents on their laps. Uno  sat in the audience, expressionless.  </P> <P> Ryutaro Hashimoto, deputy secretary general, reminded the rebels that he had  conducted a series of meetings to which all party members of Parliament had  been invited and that two-thirds of them had favored choosing a new leader  through discussions, without an election.  </P> <P> The vast majority of the 341 party members of Parliament present showed their  approval for Uno by standing.  </P> <P> The uprising, however, ensured the destruction of party unity, which had been a  hallmark of Takeshita's 19 months in office. It also set the stage for demands  for Uno's resignation should he fail to lead the party to victory in a crucial  upper house election July 23.  </P> <P> Criticism of Takeshita's virtually single-handed choice of Uno erupted earlier  in meetings Thursday of party factions, the cores of power within the ruling  party.  </P> <P> "I have never heard Uno utter a word about political reform," complained former  Prime Minister Zenko Suzuki, 78.  </P> <P> After returning from Paris, Uno paid late-night courtesy calls on both Suzuki  and former Prime Minister Takeo Fukuda, 84, who also had complained bitterly  about selecting a Nakasone lieutenant.  </P> <P> Uno is scheduled to form a new Cabinet tonight after his election in  Parliament.  </P></p>

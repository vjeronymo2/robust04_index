			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Interest charges behind sharp fall at Wates Wates City of London, the property company which holds all its assets except one within the City core, reported a fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 4.57m to Pounds 3.74m in the six months to June 30. The downturn was the result of a Pounds 1.83m rise in interest charges to Pounds 3.25m, a figure struck after capitalising Pounds 1.2m of interest from the Queen St/Cheapside property. The interest rise reflected the Pounds 19m acquisition last August of 35, Basinghall St from Trafalgar House and the repayment of Pounds 5m of redeemable warrants. The company said the annual Pounds 1.79m rental income on this property was the primary reason behind the 10 per cent rise in net rental income from Pounds 7.23m to Pounds 7.94m. There were no occupational leases due for review in the first half, but 52,300 net lettable sq ft - a property in Cheapside - were subject to an upwards only review in September. Mr John Nettleton, finance director, said that Wates had recently noticed a pick-up in demand after the 'silly offers' which followed the general election - companies were getting to the stage where they had to move. However, he also said that since Friday things were likely to revert to their former 'crawling pace'. The 'over-stated' over-supply problem would now be compounded by worries over the D-Mark and interest rates, thereby affecting the investor market. He felt, however, that the tenant market was 'relatively sure'. Debt stood at Pounds 95m (Pounds 63m), giving gearing of 52 (25) per cent. That excluded gearing on joint ventures. Earnings fell to 1.95p (2.36p) but the interim dividend is held at 0.77p.</p>

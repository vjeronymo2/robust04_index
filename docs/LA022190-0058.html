			<p><P> February 21, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE GOES UNDER REVIEW;  </P> <P> SAVINGS: CONGRESS WANTS TO RESTORE THE CONFIDENCE OF DEPOSITORS BUT DOESN'T  WANT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO TAKE UNREASONABLE RISKS.  </P> <P> Federal deposit insurance had a mixed record during the 1980s: It prevented  panic in the streets by nervous savers but also provided the fuel for  disastrously risky new ventures by savings and loan associations.  </P> <P> Today Congress begins the difficult task of reforming the insurance system to  handle banking in the 1990s. Once again, the legislators want to bolster the  shaken confidence of depositors. But they also want U.S. savings institutions  to take more reasonable risks, seeking out new lines of business as they  compete with capital-rich Japanese banks.  </P> <P> The House Banking Committee will begin considering a number of proposals as it  conducts hearings today. For example, some members of Congress would require  banks and S&amp;Ls to seek private insurance for high-risk ventures instead of  relying on the federal insurance, which guarantees deposits up to $100,000.  Some may also argue that the government should lower the $100,000 ceiling for  guaranteeing deposits. Still others may press for limiting deposit insurance to  $100,000 per person, not per account.  </P> <P> Fewer than 10% of Americans had liquid financial assets -- cash, savings and  checking accounts, certificates of deposit -- over $40,000 in 1980, when  Congress boosted the deposit guarantee limit from $40,000 to $100,000.  Brokerage houses eagerly solicited the money of wealthy investors in search of  the highest safe yield, split the money into increments of $100,000 and sent it  racing throughout the country.  </P> <P> The money poured into S&amp;Ls, and too many managers sent it surging out again  for use in dubious ventures: raw land, horse-breeding farms, shopping centers  in already jammed retail markets, condominiums with no chance of an economic  payoff.  </P> <P> Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez (D-Tex.), the House Banking Committee chairman, has  questioned whether the insured ceiling is too high and whether wealthy savers  should be allowed to have numerous accounts.  </P> <P> "Not only do we need to examine the absolute limits of the coverage," said  Gonzalez, "but (we need) to determine whether the multiple accounts maintained  by some depositors are unnecessarily increasing the risks to the (deposit  insurance) funds."  </P> <P> However, it seems unlikely that Congress would agree to roll back the $100,000  guarantee for fear that the public might view this as a retreat from vital  protection of savings.  </P> <P> "To seek to lower the $100,000 limit at this time would severely impact on  encouraging individual savings and may well have a negative effect on the  health of financial institutions," said Rep. Bruce Vento (D-Minn.), a member of  the banking committee.  </P> <P> But members agree that there will be a serious discussion of ways to remove  deposit protection from risky activities to prevent a repetition of the  investment excesses of the 1980s.  </P> <P> Gonzalez said he wants to examine "private insurance possibilities,  particularly for high-risk activities and for extended coverage beyond that  provided by the federal insurance funds." A revised insurance mechanism will  become essential to any discussion of granting new powers to banks, allowing  their widespread involvement in the securities and insurance fields.  </P> <P> L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., has  previously proposed that higher-risk activities be placed in subsidiaries with  their own capital, and rigidly separated from the savings institutions. If the  insurance or brokerage business is failing, it would get no rescue funds from  the parent bank or from the federal government, and the collapse won't harm the  bank.  </P> <P> Segregating conventional banking from higher risk ventures would be a better  answer than cutting back the amount of deposits eligible for insurance, said an  FDIC official. "In today's electronic computer-driven age, it is not much more  difficult for brokers to split $1 million into 20 accounts of $50,000 each,  than it was to create 10 accounts of $100,000," the official said.  </P> <P> S&amp;L consultant Bert Ely suggests that the ultimate solution is a private  insurance system, with banks and S&amp;Ls creating pools to provide insurance  coverage for each other. Financial institutions taking bigger risks would pay  higher premiums for insurance. Under the current system, there is no separate  recognition for risk.  </P> <P> The federal government insurance fund would be a backup in case the industry  insurance failed, said Ely.  </P></p>

			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Arts: A stale world ADRIAN Mitchell's Columbus show, A New World and the Tears of the Indians is loosely adapted from a Lope de Vega play, The Discovery of the New World, written about a century after Columbus's voyages; but in proper liberal spirit, Mitchell has set it within Bartholome de las Casas' grim contemporary testimony about the later destruction of Columbus's gentle 'Indians' by the Spaniards. Bartholome's document is just spatchcocked in: a bit by way of prologue, and much more for an epilogue in which Columbus is presented with it. It is impossible to divine what Hugh Quarshie's hero may feel here - bemused? cynical? pained? defiant? Having smouldered darkly throughout the play (something for which Quarshie has an admired knack), and given nothing that might catch fire, he merely smoulders on. The director Patrick Sandford and a hard-working multiracial cast do what they can for this half-baked text, in Robin Don's deft, inviting set. Presumably Lope's verse-play was in high epic colour with quaint native vignettes. In the programme Mitchell writes that 'hindsight has made some of his comedy unplayable' (so he has cut it); foresight, however, might have suggested that flat modern-colloquial, like most of Mitchell's language here, would not enhance the drama. Neither do the amiable little songs scattered through the affair. At what ought be the climactic moments Pete Moser's score tries harder, but an miasma of amateur pageant hangs over the whole thing. We expect Columbus to encounter Ferdinand and Isabella, and later an Atlantic mutiny, and just in time the island of San Salvador, and then some natives, and finally the royals again. He does; but only the most modest expectations are fulfilled. No discredit to the actors, who may be happy not to be named (some of them can sing well, too). What they have to work with is just too flabby and moony, too thin on character, too vaguely proportioned for the production to get a grip on it. In a loyal, stylish translation, Lope's 'popular though chaotic' play might prove considerably less unplayable than this one. It would be bound to be more interesting. At the Nuffield Theatre, South- ampton, until Saturday 2 May.</p>

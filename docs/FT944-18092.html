			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / Agenda for trade: Renato Ruggiero, would-be head of the WTO, on its tasks 'If goods cannot cross borders, soldiers will.' This familiar thought vividly depicts the strong influence that trade exercises on politics. Protectionism is a road that leads to economic nationalism and, as history proves, economic nationalism can easily transform itself into political nationalism. That is why the establishment, on January 1 1995, of the third Bretton Woods Institution, the World Trade Organisation, will be an outstanding achievement, not only for the world economy but for stability. Every possible effort has to be made to achieve this target date. The urgency of completing the ratification of the Uruguay Round is of paramount importance. The top priority for the new institution is clear. The World Trade Organisation has to be the rampart for the defence and expansion of free trade in a system of clear rules. At the same time, the WTO should become the guarantor of an efficient and credible multilateral trading system in a new era of global co-operation. But to declare the vital importance of free trade will not be sufficient. The new institution should develop a special taskforce with the aim of showing governments and public opinion what is at stake when making choices between free trade and protectionism. The globalisation of the economy and growing interdependence of national economies will increase the importance of the way each government handles its economic affairs. In fact we face an unprecedented prospect of economic growth. Between 2bn and 3bn people in Asia, Latin America and the former communist countries are entering the market economy. As both consumers and producers, they could be seen by their trading partners as an opportunity or as a challenge. The World Trade Organisation has to convince people and nations that only free trade represents the right answer to this new opportunity for growth. One of the greatest successes of the Uruguay Round has been the active participation in the negotiations, for the first time, of a very large number of developing countries. Their behaviour has shown that they want to act as full partners in the multilateral trading system and that they are ready to participate in the liberalisation process by opening their markets. The WTO will be responsible for safeguarding their legitimate expectations that their efforts will be duly matched by access to the markets of developed countries. We have to take into account the fact that the international trading system is no longer in the hands of a small group of big players. The success of the new institution will depend heavily on its ability to represent the interests of all groups, including the least developed countries. At the same time it is clear that, while free trade is the engine of growth, it cannot solve all the world's economic problems. That is why the new task of co-ordinating the work of the WTO with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank will be so important. The Uruguay Round has successfully established a unified and strong system for the settlement of disputes. It is important that the new procedure should be rapidly implemented as a response to the requirements of the trading system. The efficient functioning of the new dispute settlement procedure will be a central feature of the system. If it does not function efficiently, the rules of international trade will not be safe from attack. This requirement gains importance from the end of the cold war. Now that political considerations no longer have to be subordinated to security, there is a risk that trade conflicts will blow up out of all proportion. Last but not least, there is the growing importance of regional economic groupings such as the North American Free Trade Area and the European Union. This trend has produced remarkable successes in the process of liberalising trade around the world. In a global economy, these regional groupings facilitate the task of trade negotiations by decreasing in certain cases the number of players needing to be involved. They also encourage compromise between member governments. Regional groupings are losing some of their importance from the point of view of trade preference, with tariff levels on the industrial products of the industrialised countries at only around 4 per cent. But the increasing role of regional groupings as negotiating partners makes it easier for them to defend the trade interests of members. They may also seek to impose their own rules in international negotiations. Without an efficient and credible multilateral system, therefore, there is a risk that regionalism will bring the world economy back to bilateralism. The danger is no less important than the risks of a new protectionism. The new institution will face a formidable agenda. First, the implementation of all the agreements reached in the Uruguay Round. At the same time the unfinished business - which could not be settled in the final stage of the Uruguay Round negotiations - has to be concluded. Liberalisation of financial services, shipping services and telecommunications are on the list. The establishment of an environment committee with a clear mandate should pave the way for a solution to the difficult question of how to reconcile environmental objectives with Gatt rules. The relationship between competition policy and trade, and the treatment of investment are to be high priorities. Some governments have also raised aspects of the very complex problem of labour standards. Yet what is at stake now is the capacity of the world community to engage itself in increasing the standards of living of all mankind. This long-term effort will require more trade, more free trade and an efficient multilateral system. The author has served as Italy's ambassador to the EC and secretary general at the foreign ministry. As trade minister between 1987 and 1991, he implemented the programme for liberalising Italian foreign trade and capital movements.</p>

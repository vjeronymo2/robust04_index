			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Inger Blomqvist report: "Lieutenant General Gustav </F> Hagglund: The Russian Troops Are a Stabilizing Factor"]    [Text] Lieutenant General Gustav Hagglund, the defense  forces' future commander in chief, does not view the transfer of  troops to areas close to our borders as a threat. He noted that  they have not been stationed there to attack, but rather to  defend the St. Petersburg region and because they are dependent  on the services a garrison can provide.    Gustav Hagglund, who yesterday drank morning coffee with  members of the Association of Women Journalists, said that  originally the intention had been that around 60 percent of  Soviet soldiers returning home would be stationed in Ukraine and  Belarus. Because of the collapse of the Soviet Union these  plans came to nought and the majority ended up being stationed  in garrisons near the Finnish border.    These garrisons have -- in part through Finnish assistance  --  been extended in order to be able to accept a larger number of  soldiers.    One of the reasons why those returning home are keen to live  in a garrison is that there they can get free meals every day,  while the meal allowance paid out to those who do not live in  garrisons is only enough for food for one to two days a week.    Hagglund also pointed out that in numerical terms the troop  force is hardly increasing at all, since conscripts from the  garrisons are being transferred elsewhere.    On the other hand, the numbers of permanent staff have  increased and the quality of equipment has improved as a result  of the transfers.    He takes the view that as long as the political situation is  under control in Russia the troops do not represent any danger  to Finland, but on the contrary are a stabilizing factor.    If, however, something happens and problems with discipline  arise the troops are of course a danger, Hagglund said.    He added, however, that the Russian Army has hitherto been  surprisingly united and was not even split by the nationalists'  uprisings.    Despite poor wages and wages that at times have completely  failed to materialize the Army has remained intact.    Nor can he recall that the Soviet Army has ever rebelled, so  on the whole he views the current situation in Russia with calm.    The threat could be that the nationalists take over power or  that a civil war flares up because of further fragmentation.    On the subject of Finland's own position he said that future  defense strategy is entirely dependent on what decision the  country reaches on the European Union [EU] question.    If Finland and Sweden do not join, cooperation will continue  with the Nordic area -- cooperation that came about in the  seventies when people came up with the idea of talking about  Fennoscandia.    If Sweden were to join the EU but not Finland, the points of  reference would be different and attention would then be drawn  to the Baltic countries that would probably eventually seek  membership in the EU.    According to Hagglund, membership in the EU would give  Finland political support in a crisis situation and with it a  certain security guarantee.    He takes the view that it is difficult to plan as long as EU  membership is an open question. The defense forces are  following the same defensive line as before -- a line that,  according to Hagglund, could well serve as a model for other  small countries.    On the subject of the purchase of equipment from Russia and  the former East Germany, Gustav Hagglund said that this  equipment by no means is scrap, but is equipment that has  "filled gaps." However, he admitted that quality has not  increased as a result of the purchases and said that what the  Army needs now is high-tech equipment to come up to the levels  of the nineties. With the purchases made the Army is more on  the level of the seventies.    However, today there is no money for high-tech equipment and  he believes that if the Armed Forces had received 450 million  markkas in money instead of in materiel as a way of reducing the  Soviet Union's debt to Finland, it is likely that more equipment  for the nineties would have been bought.    According to the original framework agreement with the  Soviet  Union for the years 1991-95, Finland would buy equipment  totaling 3.7 billion markkas from the Soviet Union. Half of  this sum has now been deferred, and of the remaining half, 50  percent has gone to domestic industry. Only one-quarter of the  original sum remains in trade with our eastern neighbor.</p>

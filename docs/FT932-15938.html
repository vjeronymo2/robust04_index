			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / People: Rolls-Royce's Japanophilia now encompasses Sanders With the appointment of Keith Sanders to a senior managerial role at its Crewe headquarters, Rolls-Royce Motor Cars should gain some helpful insights into what makes Toyota's Lexus luxury car franchise tick. Lexus cars may be a rung or two down the prestige - to say nothing of price  -ladder from Rolls-Royces and Bentleys. But they have gained an envied reputation for quality and reliability since Toyota launched the brand in the late 1980s, and wreaked considerable damage to the sales of European makes like Mercedes and Jaguar in world car markets. Coming to Rolls, where he has been appointed director of UK operations, from his previous post as field operations director at Toyota (Great Britain), Sanders, 48, has had a warts-and-all view of the debut of what is probably the most luxurious model in the range of Japanese cars in the UK marketplace. Rolls-Royce's interest in the subject has been stirred by the big quality and productivity gains it is achieving from what it describes as a manufacturing 'revolution' at Crewe, where in the past 18 months there has been a wholesale adoption of Japanese-style practices. Breakeven has been more than halved to 1,400 cars a year in around 24 months. Sanders, who has also worked for Ford and Nissan, will be responsible for all Rolls' sales-related activities in the UK. He is taking over from Bernard Preston, who is appointed quality director.</p>

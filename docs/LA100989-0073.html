			<p><P> October 9, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STRIKERS CHARGE BOEING WITH STALLING TACTICS;  </P> <P> PAY KEY ISSUE AS MACHINISTS POINT TO HIGH COMPANY PROFITS, ORDER BACKLOG  </P> <P> The president of the union representing 57,800 workers in the fifth day of a  strike against the Boeing Co. accused the aerospace manufacturing giant Sunday  of "stalling" and "playing games" about resuming negotiations.  </P> <P> Tom Baker, president of Local 751 of the International Assn. of Machinists and  Aerospace Workers, said he could not guess when the two sides will return to  the bargaining table, although the union is prepared to meet as soon as Boeing  presents a new proposal.  </P> <P> Boeing spokesman Harold Carr said Friday that the company was prepared to begin  negotiations as soon as the union's leadership "consolidated" their positions  on the issues of wage increases, bonuses and overtime.  </P> <P> "They are playing games when they talk about 'consolidation,' " Baker said in a  telephone interview. "They know what the issues are, where the hang-up is. . .  . That's all just game playing, stalling on their part, until they decide how  to get back into the negotiations and deal with the problem."  </P> <P> Federal mediator Douglas Hammond, reached at home Sunday, said he spoke with  representatives from both Boeing and the union over the weekend "and nothing is  scheduled."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Evergreen Airways Corp. of Taiwan said it signed contracts Friday  with Boeing Commercial Airplanes, a division of Boeing Co., and McDonnell  Douglas Corp. for the purchase of 26 aircraft valued at a total of $3.6  billion.  </P> <P> </P> <P> $1.93-Billion Order  </P> <P> According to the agreements, Boeing will deliver eight 747-400 and four  767-300ER passenger jets to Evergreen between 1992 and 1997, while McDonnell  Douglas will deliver 14 MD-11 craft.  </P> <P> The total Boeing order, including options, is worth $1.93 billion in  delivery-year dollars, the price Evergreen will pay when it actually receives  the planes, Boeing spokesman Craig Martin said.  </P> <P> An overwhelming number of Boeing machinists voted Oct. 3 to reject the  company's proposed three-year contract and strike Oct. 4, the first walkout  against Boeing since 1977.  </P> <P> About 43,000 stopped working in the Puget Sound area, 11,700 in the military  aircraft division in Wichita, Kan., 1,700 in Portland, Ore., and a few hundred  others at scattered sites around the country.  </P> <P> The Boeing offer included the first general wage increases since 1982 -- 4%  this year, and 3% in each of the next two years. It also provided for an 8%  bonus this year and 3% the second.  </P> <P> According to Boeing, the lowest grade of machinists now earn a base salary of  $24,805, while the most experienced earn $38,461 without overtime or bonuses.  </P> <P> Baker has said the union expected a double-digit pay raise this year to offset  the lack of base increases since 1982, and in light of the record number of  airplane orders that Boeing has stacked up, resulting in record profits.  </P> <P> But Baker declined Sunday to be specific about what the union requests are.  "The company knows we can't state publicly and wouldn't state publicly what  kind of pay raise would be acceptable to the membership," he said. "Obviously,  wages is the No. 1 issue."  </P> <P> Baker said the union is prepared for a long strike, if necessary, but he would  prefer a fairly quick settlement.  </P> <P> "The company has got a good, happy work force, one that's loyal to the  company," Baker said. "The longer they are out, the longer it is going to take  for (Boeing) to get the work force to being as productive as they normally  would be."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Backlog of Orders  </P> <P> Boeing has a backlog of about 1,600 airplanes on order, enough to keep  production lines moving through most of the 1990s.  </P> <P> There were about 40 planes partially completed when the strike began, and  Boeing officials have said they expect them to be completed by supervisors and  other nonunion personnel.  </P> <P> The first planes finished during the strike rolled off assembly lines Friday --  a 747-400 for Malaysia Airlines and a 757 for Ansett World Leasing of  Australia.  </P></p>

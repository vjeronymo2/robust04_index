			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / International Company News: Norgeskreditt profits ahead at halfway NORGESKREDITT, Norway's largest private-sector mortgage company, increased profits before tax to NKr148.9m (Dollars 20.02m) in the first six months from NKr66.6m in the same 1992 period. The company said it had been helped by the fall in Norwegian interest rates. Higher net interest income and gains on bond and share trading more than offset an increase in loan losses, it stated. Net interest income rose to NKr150.7m from NKr105.3m, while gains from securities amounted to NKr51.8m, compared with a NKr1.2m loss in the first half of 1992. Loan losses increased to NKr28.0m from NKr22.1m. The company said it held 13 repossessed commercial properties, as at June 30, with a book value of NKr38.1m. Norgeskreditt won shareholder backing for its plan to become a commercial bank in April.</p>

			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / Ramos takes emergency powers to cope with crippling power cuts PRESIDENT Fidel Ramos of the Philippines yesterday signed a bill giving him emergency powers to deal with electric power shortages that have disrupted the economy. Daily power cuts, lasting six to eight hours, have occurred since the year began, sometimes in peak hours, disrupting industry and households. The new law allows Mr Ramos to negotiate contracts for building new power plants, instead of having to go through the legal bidding process. This is expected to spur a 1,600 megawatt expansion of the Luzon grid, which services Manila and nearby industrial centres. This would cover a shortfall in capacity and provide a reserve allowing refurbishment of existing plants. The president said the law 'gives me the requisite mandate to more effectively address the problem,' which is hampering his administration's efforts to pull the economy out of recession and catch up with more prosperous neighbours. The government is targeting growth in gross national product of 3.5 to 4.5 per cent this year, after a stagnant performance in the past two years. Manila businesses have been forced by the power cuts to lay off some 71,000 workers, according to Ms Nieves Confesor, labour secretary. Incomes of more than 2m time-rated workers have been halved because of reduced working hours, she said. The law authorises the government to raise the charges of the National Power Corporation, the state-owned electricity company, enabling it to meet loan covenants with foreign creditors, particularly the World Bank. A rate increase was approved last December but opponents secured a restraining order in the supreme court. The law circumvents the court embargo to satisfy conditions of creditors. About Dollars 110m (Pounds 73m) of new financing for new power projects can now be expected from creditors. It also allows Mr Ramos to reorganise the power company and possibly break it up into smaller units which could be sold to private investors. Another provision of the law channels part of earnings from state-run gambling casinos into power projects. The state national electrification administration yesterday secured financing for acquisition of 104 mini-hydro power generators, with a combined capacity of 51 megawatts, to be installed in the provinces. The generators, financed with aid from Britain, China, France, Norway and Australia, will be used to light homes and power irrigation pumps and rice mills in rural areas.</p>

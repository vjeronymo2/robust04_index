Alvaro Ayala reports.    [Ayala] U.S. Attorney General Reno told de Greiff: I am  increasingly concerned by the fact that in your correspondence  you do not include information on the process of conversations  with the chieftains of the Cali Cartel and because you have not  mentioned that the Prosecutor General's Office plans to  prosecute and put those chieftains on trial. These omissions  are what create the environment of distrust you mention in your  letters.    Today the prosecutor general reacted and reminded his U.S.  counterpart, Janet Reno, that in Colombia the judicial system  functions independently, without bending to foreign pressure.    [Begin recording]    de Greiff: Colombia's Judicial Branch cannot be  subjected to the evaluations Ms. Reno may want to pass on the  evidence they supply. Cooperation is fine, but impositions are  not. [end recording]    The prosecutor general said that on 20 June he will be 65  and  that his remaining in his post depends on the Supreme Court of  Justice. He said that personally he would like to complete the  four-year period for which he was elected.    The Supreme Court of Justice, the High Council of the  Judiciary, and a U.S. court adviser, have stated their support  for de Greiff.    William Davis is an important U.S. court adviser. He is in  Colombia participating in a seminar on court backlogs organized  by the High Council of the Judiciary. He spoke at the seminar  with journalists and spoke out in defense of Prosecutor General  de Greiff, saying that the institution de Greiff heads is too  new to have to endure the strong criticism of the U.S. attorney  general. [Begin recording]    Davis: I said: Look, these things take five years  and they are complex. We live in a world where people expect  results in a matter of months, weeks, or days instead of years.  [end recording]    The Judicial Branch stated its support for the independence  of the Prosecutor General's Office and not only criticized Ms.  Reno's intrusion but also the Colombian Security Council's  decision to reject the transfer of five Medellin Cartel members  from Bogota to Itagui. [Begin recording]    Justice Pablo Caceres: Other countries cannot  expect the anatomy of the Prosecutor General's Office to depend  on their opinions.    Justice Ricardo Calvete: If the Prosecutor  General's Office finds that these people's due process and their  right to a defense must be guaranteed, then ways must be found  to strictly comply with this.

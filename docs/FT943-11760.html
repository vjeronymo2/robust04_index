			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / International Company News: Credit Lyonnais sells further UAP stake Credit Lyonnais, the troubled state-owned bank, yesterday announced the sale of a 16 per cent stake in its subsidiary Union des Assurances Federales. This brings total assets sold off since March by the bank's new management to FFr5.6bn (Dollars 1bn). Credit Lyonnais said its private placement of the stake with French and foreign investors would bring in FFr1.16bn. This would realise a FFr650m capital gain for the bank which is striving to rebuild its funds in the face of record losses and bad debts. The bank's recent sale of its stake in FNAC, the record and book chain, to the Pinault group gave it FFr4.5bn. Credit Lyonnais now holds 51 per cent of UAF having sold a 33 per cent stake in January for FFr2bn. It said yesterday it intended to keep UAF as its main life insurance operation and future vehicle for managing private pension funds, if and when these were introduced in France. By contrast, Credit Lyonnais said it was still looking for a partner in non-life insurance whose products could be marketed in its banking network. Allianz of Germany confirmed yesterday it was discussing just such a partnership with the French bank. Credit Lyonnais had earlier approached Assurances Generales de France (AGF) on such a deal, but the latter decided to turn instead to Societe Generale as it banking partner. Societe Generale has said it wanted to increase its stake in AGF to 6 per cent from 2 per cent, on the latter's privatisation. Credit Lyonnais this week refused to comment on reports that it wanted to sell its 3 per cent stake in Total, the oil company. The French Treasury is reported to want AGF to buy these shares, under an agreement that state-owned shareholders in Total would give each other first option on any of their share sales. But AGF said it had received no request to buy the Credit Lyonnais stake in Total.</p>

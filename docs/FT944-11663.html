			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / International Company News: Molson falls to CDollars 32m in second quarter Earnings at Molson, the diversified Canadian brewing group, were hit in the latest quarter by continuing problems at the US arm of Diversey, its cleaning services subsidiary, writes Bernard Simon in Toronto. Earnings for the second quarter to September 30 fell to CDollars 32.7m (USDollars 24m), or 56 cents per share, from CDollars 37.2m, or 63 cents, a year earlier. Revenues dipped to CDollars 759.8m from CDollars 769.3m. Molson Breweries, which is jointly owned by Molson, Australia's Foster's Brewing and Miller of the US, reported little-changed quarterly operating profits of CDollars 36.1m. Sales in the US jumped by 56 per cent to 1.4m hectolitres in the six months to September 30, due mainly to the launch of Molson Ice in August 1993. But earnings were hit by a price war in some domestic markets. Diversey's operating profit tumbled to CDollars 17.2m from CDollars 25.2m, despite a 15 per cent increase in sales. A loss of CDollars 8.4m was posted in the US for the six months to September 30.</p>

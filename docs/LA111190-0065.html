			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLATFORM;  </P> <P> THE BOTTOM LINE  </P> <P> The nature of the homeless (problem) on the Westside is different than that on  Skid Row. We have a lot of employable people.  </P> <P> We also have a lot of people who are employed. But because of the housing  costs, which are outrageous, they become homeless.  </P> <P> The latest estimate shows about 10,000 homeless (people) on the Westside.  </P> <P> We also get a number of people who come in from other sections because it's  nicer to be homeless on the Westside. It's safer. The beaches are here. There's  a whole different mentality than there is on Skid Row, an yet there are very  limited services, because, people don't want to think that affluent areas or  semi-affluent areas like the Westside have homeless problems.  </P> <P> I think people on the Westside are concerned about the homeless. (But) there's  also a concern about personal safety and about property values.  </P> <P> The solution to the problem is affordable housing. That's the bottom line.  </P></p>

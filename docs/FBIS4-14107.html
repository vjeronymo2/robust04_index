			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 27 Apr (MENA)--Dr. Nabil Sha'th, chief  Palestinian negotiator to the Gaza-Jericho talks, has stated  that the negotiations have reached the phase of the final  drafting of the agreement. He praised the Egyptian leaders'  efforts to help achieve this progress. At a news conference  this afternoon, Dr. Sha'th said both sides are doing their best  to reach an agreement and that the Israeli delegation will for  the first time remain in Cairo over the weekend.    Dr. Sha'th said that the only topics officially deferred to  the meeting between Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat and  Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin are the size of the Jericho  area and the Palestinian presence on the Allenby Bridge. If any  other problems remain, they will be automatically deferred to  them.    Dr. Sha'th said the negotiators will continue their talks  until a final agreement is signed. He explained that the date  of the signing of the agreement will not be set until official  invitations are sent for the attendance of the signing ceremony.    Dr. Sha'th said we are moving quickly and it is very  difficult for us to evaluate what we have achieved so far.    Asked whether an agreement has been reached on the issue of  legal jurisdiction, Dr. Sha'th said this point is still under  discussion. He indicated that today's talks did not encounter  any major problems. They dealt with the transfer of civilian  powers to the Palestinian civilian authority. He noted that  these points were agreed on before but that they are being  incorporated into one document. He added that there has been  progress made on the issue of detainees.    Asked whether the Palestinian and Israeli delegations will  defer the issue of legal jurisdiction to the 'Arafat-Peres  meeting, Dr. Sha'th said we are trying not to leave out any  point we can discuss. We are trying to spare 'Arafat and Peres  the effort. He added that the timetable being prepared now is  measured in days and not weeks.    Dr. Sha'th said he met with Israeli Communications Minister  Shulamit Aloni, who promised to help speed up the negotiating  process, especially on the issuance of Palestinian stamps, which  is a point of disagreement between the Israelis and Palestinians.</p>

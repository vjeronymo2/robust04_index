			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Letter: Mines - private sector alternative, figures 'misleading', efficient but too costly Sir, Adam Smith said very good grapes could be raised in Scotland, and very good wine too could be made of them. But he pointed out that equally good wine could imported much more cheaply from foreign countries. British miners, aided by heavy capital investment, may be very efficient at extracting coal. But British coal producers have been protected for far too long from competition from much cheaper foreign imports. Tax-payers and energy users can no longer afford it.

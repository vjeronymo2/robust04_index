			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / Observer: Rising star Is Morgan Grenfell's John Craven about to be joined by another foreigner on the Deutsche Bank board? News that Gianemilio Osculati, the smooth, silver-haired managing director of Banca d'America e d'Italia (BAI), is leaving Milan to take a 'senior management' post at BAI's parent Deutsche Bank, has certainly set tongues wagging. Osculati, the former head of McKinsey's European banking practice, who was hired to run BAI just before its sale to the Germans, has made a success of the company, almost doubling profits in the past four years. But the affable Osculati, 45, may have to wait a while. Like Craven he is hardly fluent in German, and a slot on the bank's current 13 member board is not likely to become vacant until the end of next year, when Horst Burgard is expected to retire.</p>

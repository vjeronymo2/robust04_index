			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Next Next provides a graphic illustration of the rewards that stem from running an extraordinarily badly-managed business half-way well. Two years ago, Next recorded a net loss of Pounds 223m. Last year it made pre-tax profits of Pounds 39m. It is easy to see how Next became the City's favourite recovery stock. But the natural question is: what next? The company's balance sheet has certainly been transformed. Operationally too, Next has made giant strides. By rationalising its irrational store portfolio and cutting its outlets from 450 to 305, Next has boosted efficiencies. Sales per sq ft have risen 40 per cent over the past two years. The company's trading momentum, with sales currently running 12 per cent ahead, should permit further gains. Sourcing, stock control and service have all improved significantly but still lag best industry practice. This should provide further headroom for profits growth without the company having to resort to anything silly by way of acquisitions. Next is certainly not going to repeat its spectacular share price performance of the past year. A sub-market forward rating seems grudging nonetheless. The same could be said for the whole retail sector which has been looking forlorn of late. Results from Kingfisher, Argos and now Next point to consumer spending being healthier than expected. With costs pared to the bone, operationally-geared retailers should register strong profits gains on even small sales increases.</p>

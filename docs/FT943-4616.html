			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / Paisley blasts 'dictator' Major The Rev Ian Paisley stood on home territory yesterday, still fuming after his Downing Street confrontation with Mr John Major. In a characteristically inflammatory press conference at the new east Belfast headquarters of the Democratic Unionist party, which he leads, Mr Paisley referred angrily to the way Mr Major abruptly ended their meeting on Tuesday. Flanked by DUP MPs Mr Paisley was cheered by a dozen flag-waving supporters as he bluntly refused to answer questions from journalists from Irish nationalist papers and barked abuse at agency and national television reporters. He stepped up his war of words with the British government by equating the prime minister with Hitler. 'It was the stance of a dictator who says that either you believe me or you go to the gas chambers,' he said. He reiterated his hardline opposition to the UK-Irish peace process. At the Downing Street meeting Mr Major repeatedly interrupted Mr Paisley's attempt to read a long statement on the political situation in Northern Ireland. Yesterday Mr Paisley demanded a retraction from a national television channel which reported that he had locked himself in a Downing Street lavatory. He said he had read the remainder of his statement to a civil servant after Mr Major, with two Northern Ireland Office ministers, had abruptly left the meeting. He again refused to accept Mr Major's reassurances that there had been no secret deals with the IRA as part of last week's ceasefire announcement, and accused the UK and Irish governments being part of 'a conspiracy' to take Ulster out of the UK. Mr Paisley said he had no immediate plans to call for a campaign of Unionist civil protest, as he did in opposition to the Hillsborough agreement in the 1980s. 'I am not calling on my supporters to take to the streets,' he said. 'We shall be putting forward practical plans for a Unionist forum.' Many unionists outside the DUP were critical yesterday of Mr Paisley's position. A number of senior members of the Ulster Unionist party, including its general secretary, Mr Jim Wilson, said the DUP leader was undermining the Unionist cause at a crucial time in the province's political history. But the unionist newspaper The Newsletter said it had been inundated with calls from readers registering disgust at the way Mr Paisley had been treated in Downing Street.</p>

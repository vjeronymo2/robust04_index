			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / Pirelli treads a careful path on Continental: The latest twist in the saga The man from Mercedes-Benz was astounded. A Pirelli manager had just offered a big tyre price reduction, something the German luxury car company had neither asked for nor expected. With stories like this, it is no wonder some analysts say the tyre industry almost seems to have a death wish. Tyre producers have indulged in an orgy of price-slashing. This has depressed their own selling prices even further at a time of crisis in the industry and left the car companies crowing with delight. As tyremakers' profits have been decimated, due both to the motor industry's tough cost-cutting efforts and their own aggressive competition, car producers have enjoyed price cuts of more than 20 per cent in the past year or so. Adding to the tyre manufacturer's woes is the downturn in vehicle sales in some European markets after the steep decline in the US. On new car business, says Mr Philip Wylie, motor analyst with Salomon Brothers in London, 'they're all losing money on each tyre they make'. It is against this background that the latest, almost melodramatic, phase in the tussle between Italy's Pirelli and Continental of Germany has been played out. Having been rebuffed in its first attempt at merger talks, Pirelli has succeeded in getting so-called 'round table' discussions under way. And the man who so vigorously kept Pirelli at bay, Mr Horst Urban, Continental's combative chief executive, has had to go. His departure was announced on Friday. Mr Urban had initially found it easy, helped by Morgan Grenfell, Continental's UK merchant bank adviser, to shoot down Pirelli's suggested merger terms. These would have basically involved Continental paying a high price to take over Pirelli's tyre assets, but then ceding management control to Milan. At this stage, it is anyone's guess what will happen. Clearly, a merger looks far more likely, but it is still by no means a foregone conclusion. Nor is it entirely apparent that an amalgamation would produce significant benefits. Despite the big international takeovers in the tyre industry, such as Japan's Bridgestone buying Firestone, and Michelin of France taking over Uniroyal-Goodrich, the aggressive pricing tactics of the big manufacturers continue. Michelin, which has announced big job cuts, is seen as one of the top price-cutters. 'Competition has been stepped up another pace,' says Mr John Lawson, motor analyst with Nomura Research in London. 'The US market is going from bad to worse, so the timing of the acquisitions everyone has made there look disastrous.' This obviously also includes Continental's own purchase of General Tire, now feeling the brunt of the US automotive slump. Pirelli's argument, which claims support from owners of more than 51 per cent of Continental's shares - including 5 per cent in its own hands - is that the need for a merger is strengthened by the crisis. It has outlined big savings on production, marketing and development, as well as geographical advantages. Continental has admitted savings could be made, but disputes their size. In the end, Mr Urban's uncompromising tone proved too discordant for the supervisory board, which forced him out last week. His backing, even from the labour representatives, dissolved as it apparently became clear that the company, and the industry, was in a worse situation than he had portrayed it  -especially in the viciously competitive US market. The feeling grew that discussions with Pirelli should be pursued more constructively. The head of the non-executive supervisory board is Mr Ulrich Weiss, an executive of Deutsche Bank, which also owns Morgan Grenfell. At a supervisory board meeting on the Friday before last he clashed with Mr Urban  -embittered sources in Continental talk of provocation. Mr Urban told Mr Weiss after the meeting that he would resign if the board did not support him. It was that issue which the board met to discuss in Hanover on Thursday. Lining up with Mr Weiss was Mr Friedrich Schiefer, finance director and chief executive-designate of the Allianz insurance group. Allianz holds 5 per cent of Continental's stock and is thought to be in the Pirelli camp. They, it is believed, were joined by Mr Gunther Sassmannshausen, former head of the Preussag steel and metals group, Mr Ernst Pieper, chief executive of Preussag, and Mr Klaus Piltz, chairman of the Veba energy group. Faced with such weighty opposition, Mr Urban agreed to go. He is succeeded by 60-year old Mr Wilhelm Winterstein, six years older and generally seen as an interim choice. Mr Winterstein, previously purchasing director, has been in the tyre business for 35 years and is thought more likely to enter into talks with Pirelli in a positive spirit. In Milan, the Italian company has built a wall of silence around its headquarters, saying nothing about where, when, or at what level these talks will take place. The company is avoiding triumphalism - otherwise obvious in the Italian press. But by stressing the need for 'the utmost confidentiality' in the discussions with Continental, it is acknowledging the delicate balance in Germany which has tipped the scales against Mr Urban. Thus, the traditionally taciturn Pirelli is more circumspect than ever for fear of triggering an adverse reaction in Germany which might embarrass its supporters there. The most sensitive issue is control of the combined tyres operation, if a merger comes about. Despite the strong trading links between Italy and Germany, Italian companies are much less conspicuous in the German market than vice versa. Not only does the short-termism often evident in Italy's business sector clash with longer-range German practices, but Italian companies often face severe image problems in Germany. Their relative absence there reflects the tendency to concentrate on southern Europe and the immense difficulties which Italian businessmen often have in finding high-quality German managers. Thus, apart from discussions on valuations and the structure of any merger, control is likely to be the trickiest issue that Pirelli must address. Nevertheless, its mood marks a sharp change from the bitter words of the letter it issued to shareholders last February following the decision by Continental's supervisory board not to pursue talks. Pirelli referred angrily to the inconsistency of the response shown towards its plans by 'the heads of some major German institutions'. Although these were not named, the reference to Mr Weiss was unmistakeable. Pirelli claimed that he initially 'gave his agreement and support' to its tyre merger proposal. Deutsche Bank, in turn, accused Pirelli of acting in a way that was 'misleading and thus likely to produce a false impression'. That atmosphere of tit-for-tat accusations has now evaporated. But when the final chapter of this saga is written, the position of Germany's biggest bank - and the issue of bank-industry links and boardroom representation in Germany in general - will warrant special attention. So will the need for comprehensive, stringent takeover and share disclosure rules. For while the Pirelli-Continental affair will not make bid-sensitive German executives quake in their boots, it has added a fascinating but more uncertain dimension to Germany's mergers and acquisitions scene.</p>

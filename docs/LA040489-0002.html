			<p><P> April 4, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE;  </P> <P> 'QUAKE MONTH' IN SHAKY START  </P> <P> An earthquake rumbled through Northern California, helping mark the state's  Earthquake Preparedness Month. The magnitude 5 temblor also broke window glass  and dumped items from some store shelves, but there was no serious damage and  no injuries, authorities said. Centered on the Calaveras fault, about eight  miles east of Milpitas, the temblor caused the ground to roll for about 20  seconds, witnesses said. It was felt as far north as Petaluma, in many  communities to the east of San Francisco and south to the Monterey Peninsula.  April was proclaimed 1989 Earthquake Preparedness Month by Gov. George  Deukmejian. The campaign, with the theme "Beat the Quake," seeks to educate the  public about earthquake safety. April 18 is the anniversary of the great San  Francisco earthquake of 1906, which triggered fires that destroyed most of the  city.  </P></p>

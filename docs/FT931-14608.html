			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / International Company News: Charge to give Dow Chemical loss for year DOW Chemical, the second biggest US chemicals group, yesterday warned of a disappointing fourth quarter and unveiled a Dollars 430m pre-tax charge against 1992 earnings. The charges are to cover restructuring moves, including job cuts and plant closures. Mr Enrique Falla, Dow executive vice president, said: 'Business conditions in basic chemicals and plastics continue to remain disappointing, particularly in Europe where margins are negative.' This softness will be reflected in fourth-quarter results, 'which we now expect to be weaker than previously expected', he said. Like much of corporate America, Dow is also adopting new accounting standards. It now expects to post of loss of Dollars 1.70 to Dollars 1.90 a share for the whole of 1992. In 1991, Dow took special pre-tax charges of Dollars 370m which led to a fourth-quarter loss of Dollars 94m, or 35 cents a share. For the whole of 1991, Dow earned Dollars 935m or Dollars 3.46 a share. Analysts expect group 1992 fourth-quarter earnings from continuing operations of about 40 cents a share. Dow said its 1992 special charges reflect asset write-offs and write-downs, plant shutdowns, divestitures and the consolidation of a variety of business activities globally. Costs related to workforce reductions have also been included in the charge. The company recently announced a management shake-up aimed at creating more flexibility in the management structure and improving international competitiveness.</p>

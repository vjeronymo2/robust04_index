The FMLN activist was identified as Ismael Bernardino,  and the incident took place early on Wednesday in the town of  Nahuizalco, in western Sonsonate Department.    FMLN spokeswoman Aida Sanchez explained that according to  preliminary reports in her possession three individuals went to  Bernardino's home and killed him. "The hooded individuals were  carrying large caliber weapons," the relatives of the victim  indicated. Sanchez stated the men tried to create the  impression this was a burglary but did not take anything from  the house. It cannot be ruled out that a death squad killed  Bernardino, who was fully participating in the political  campaign, since these groups "are still active" in El Salvador,  the spokeswoman stressed.    Representative of the UN Observers for El Salvador went to  the site to begin an investigation.</p>

			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / International Company News: Singapore Airlines slips 14.8% SINGAPORE Airlines (SIA), consistently one of the world's most profitable airlines, has finally succumbed to the effects of the recession in much of the industrialised world. For the year ended March, the airline saw pre-tax profits slide by 14.8 per cent to SDollars 945m (USDollars 591m), compared with 1991-92. Turnover was 4.2 per cent higher at SDollars 5.65bn. Lower tax provisions due to the availability of high capital allowances help limit the damage lower down the profit and loss account, with net earnings slipping 8.4 per cent to SDollars 850m. SIA blamed recession in the industrialised world, intense competition and the strong Singapore dollar. There were no aircraft disposal profits, against SDollars 88m last time. The airline, excluding cargo, engineering and other group subsidiaries, made pre-tax profits of SDollars 794m - down 26.8 per cent - on revenues 2.4 per cent higher at SDollars 5.135bn. SIA said the transfer of the airline company's engineering activities to a separate engineering subsidiary partially contributed to the fall in company profits. Last year, SIA increased its capacity by nearly 18 per cent. Four new destinations - New York, Durban, Madrid and Hanoi - were added during the year. Passenger and cargo failed to keep pace with this increase in capacity. The load factor dropped more than 2 per cent to 67.8 per cent, with the passenger seat factor down 2.2 per cent and cargo down 1 per cent. The yield  -the revenue earned per passenger or tonne of freight - dropped by more than 10 per cent. Analysts said that in spite of the fall in profits, SIA continued to outperform most of the world's airlines. They pointed out that SIA's performance improved slightly in the second half of 1992-93, and that the airline was sitting on a comfortable cash cushion.</p>

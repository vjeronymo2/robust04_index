			<p>BFN     [Text] Hizballah has stated that U.S. Secretary of State  Warren Christopher's tour of the region is not designed to  overcome the obstacles hindering the bilateral negotiations but  to further divide the Arab ranks. It stressed that Washington  is only pursuing its traditional policy of fragmenting and  undermining the Arab position and enhancing the circumstances  conducive to imposing a settlement according to Zionist  conditions.    Hizballah released a statement yesterday on Christopher's  tour, saying: Christopher's tour comes at a time when there are  expectations of a possible relaxation in the negotiating process  after the complications caused by the massacres that the  Zionists committed in the occupied territories, notably the  massacre in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron, which left more  than 60 Palestinians dead and hundreds wounded and maimed.    Those who are optimistic about Christopher's tour believe  that U.S. diplomacy is again focusing on the conflict in the  region, particularly in view of the approaching date for the  signing of the limited administrative self-rule agreement  between the Zionists and 'Arafat. The statement said:  Washington may consider the signing of the agreement as an  accomplishment that it has long waited for and that it may pave  the way for further breakthroughs on the other negotiating  tracks.    It seems obvious, however, that Christopher is not coming to  the region to help surmount the obstacles hampering the  negotiations, as reported, but to focus on enhancing the policy  of dividing the Arab stance. The U.S. secretary of state wants  to put more pressure on the Gulf countries to abolish all  boycotting of Israel and, consequently, to demand that they  exert all possible efforts to pressure Syria to respond to the  Zionist conditions for a settlement.    Regarding Jordan, Christopher will use the lifting of the  siege of Aqaba port not in return for Jordan's renewed  participation in the negotiations, as certain people imagine,  but for signing a bilateral agreement with the Zionist entity.    The statement added: Regarding Lebanon, the U.S. conditions  were set before Christopher's tour of the region. These  conditions were declared by enemy Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin:  "Halting and disarming the resistance, assimilating Lahd's  militiamen, and initiating negotiations leading to security  arrangements in south Lebanon." The U.S. ambassador in Beirut  reasserted the same conditions during his recent meetings with  Lebanese officials.    The statement added: Regarding the Palestinian track, the  Americans show their satisfaction with the approaching date for  the signing of the self-rule agreement because it reflects Yasir  'Arafat's acceptance of the maximum Zionist conditions and  minimum prerequisites for the limited self-rule.    Hizballah noted that Washington, which claims to sponsor the  peace process, is in fact pursuing its traditional policy of  fragmenting and undermining the Arab position and promoting the  circumstances conducive to imposing a settlement according to  the Zionist conditions. We emphasize that Washington fully  adopts this policy, otherwise where are the U.S. commitments  that have been declared since the Madrid conference, which were  reasserted at the Geneva summit? We believe that these  commitments are only cosmetic to improve the image of the U.S.  role and conceal its truth and hazards.    The statement said: In the past we warned that the fragile  Arab situation will not enable the Arabs to stand up to the  U.S.-Zionist onslaught, which at one time seeks to take the  Arabs unilaterally and at another to pressure the Arabs to  normalize ties with Israel. This means that the Arab negotiating  policy has never embodied its own interests or was able to cope  with this stage of the confrontation. Hence the importance of  the role that the resistance is playing in south Lebanon and the  intifadah in the occupied Palestinian territories in confronting  the policy of penetrating the Arab ranks, taking them  unilaterally, or exhorting them to normalize ties with Israel,  and in offsetting Arab defeats. The resistance in the south and  the intifadah in the occupied territories are making progress to  offset the astonishing concessions being made by the ilk of  'Arafat and certain Arab countries, particularly the Gulf  countries.</p>

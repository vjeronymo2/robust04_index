			<p><P> October 2, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BLACK ACTORS THEATRE LEASES SITE IN SANTA ANA  </P> <P> The Orange County Black Actors Theatre has taken what its founder described as  "a first step toward a permanent home." The 8-year-old amateur troupe, which  has produced shows most recently in Brea and Anaheim, on Monday leased a  basement space here at 410 W. 4th St.  </P> <P> Adleane Hunter, the troupe's founder and producing artistic director, said she  hopes to put in a 100-seat theater by next June -- if $15,000 can be raised to  equip and renovate the 2,000-square-foot space. Until then, it will be used for  workshops and rehearsals and as an office.  </P> <P> The lease costs $1,100 per month, Hunter said, and runs through Sept. 30, 1991.  </P> <P> She said the cost will be defrayed by a recent $12,500 grant from the city.  </P> <P> The troupe hopes to stage productions this season at other theaters around the  county -- "The Trial of One Short-Sighted Black Woman vs. Mammy Louise and  Safreeta Mae," by Marsha Leslie, at the Gem Theatre in Garden Grove from Jan.  24 to Feb. 17; and "Fences," by August Wilson, at the Curtis Theatre in Brea  from April 26 to May 18 -- before opening the new space June 27 with "The  Colored Museum," by George C. Wolfe. However, Hunter said, rights to "Fences"  and "The Colored Museum" still must be secured.  </P> <P> She also said acquiring the new space does not change the troupe's desire to  become a part-time resident company at Brea's Curtis Theatre, where it  showcased "Ain't Misbehavin' " in April.

			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / Russia cracks down on banks Russia yesterday increased the minimum capital requirement for commercial banks by 20 times in an attempt to flush out hundreds of small under-capitalised banks and consolidate the Russian banking sector. Mr Dmitry Tulin, deputy governor of the central bank, said that from next Monday, the minimum capital requirement for new banks would be increased to Rbs2bn (Pounds 868,000 at the market rate) from a present threshold of Rbs100m. Existing banks, as well as those which manage to get a licence by next Monday, will be given until January 1995 to increase their capital to Rbs2bn. From 1999, the minimum capital requirement for all players will rise to a European Union threshold of Ecu5m (Pounds 3.78m). Mr Tulin said the aim was to protect depositors, reduce money-laundering through the banking sector and help banks compete internationally. Exempt from the new requirement would be agricultural co-operative banks which the authorities want to establish in the Russian countryside and which would keep the Rbs100m threshold. Another threshold of Rbs500m would be established for banks which did not take deposits from the population. With inflation of around 20 per cent a month, unchanged minimum capital requirements have made it increasingly easy to start a bank. 'A situation where entrepreneurs face the choice of either buying a good car or setting up a bank is paradoxical and abnormal,' Mr Tulin told a news conference. Despite the fact that many of Russia's 2,000 banks are small and under-capitalised, many of the threats to Russian banking come from larger banks, in particular those owed lots of money by ailing enterprises which also happen to be their shareholders. Other problems are institutional, including a shortage of tools for assessing project risk and recovering loans. Mr Andrei Tsumailo, vice-president of Most-Bank, one of Russia's big private commercial banks, hailed the plan's 1999 target as a 'reasonable long-term goal'. But he believed that in the shorter term many banks' shareholders, such as ailing industrial enterprises, would be unable to raise the necessary capital. At best, such companies would have to divert funds earmarked for investment 'in an economy which is under-capitalised in every sector'. Mr Tulin said banks which could not meet the new requirements would either have to merge with bigger institutions or fold. The central bank last year withdrew the licences of 19 banks, many of which met its minimum capital requirements but abused the central bank's overdraft facility.</p>

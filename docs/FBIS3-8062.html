			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Janos Martonyi, state secretary at the </F> Foreign Ministry, by Gabor Lambert and Lajos Pietsch; place and  date not given: "There Should Not Be a Domestic Political  Debate on the Membership -- Interview With Janos Martonyi on Our  Application for EU Membership"]    [Excerpts] [MAGYAR NEMZET] On 1 March in Bonn, Prime  Minister Peter Boross announced that our application for  European Union [EU] membership will be submitted in April. Why  this haste, and what do we expect from this step?    [Martonyi] First about the haste. The idea of the  application for membership first emerged when former Prime  Minister Jozsef Antall visited Brussels. Unfortunately, the  association agreement came into force later than we had expected  because of the delay in the process of ratification. Finally,  it came into force on 1 February, which put the issue of full  membership on the agenda. The other element of all this is that  work on an expert level has been going on for a long time and we  have drawn up the government's integration policy. It was clear  from the beginning that, in this integration strategy, one of  the questions -- although not necessarily the most important one  -- is the timing of the application for membership. All I am  really trying to say is that this process started a long time  ago, and domestic political considerations had nothing to do  with it. I can state this very definitely.    In our view, this application has to be submitted now. We  would lose at least two years if we waited until 1996, when the  inter- governmental conference on the future of the Union is  held. We must not do this, the deadline of the year 2000 is  very important for us. We have always emphasized that the  association agreement was a stage on the way to full membership.  If we do not continue on this road, and stop at an intermediate  stage, then I am convinced that we will find ourselves in an  unfavorable situation in 2001-2002. [passage omitted]    [MAGYAR NEMZET] Was the selection of the timing influenced  by a subjective element, namely it seems that the current French  minister for European affairs [Alain Lamassoure] seems to be  more positive about Hungarian membership than his predecessors?    [Martonyi] Indeed, as far as I know, Lamassoure was the  first one to verify in the press the Hungarian intention to  submit the application for membership. He also said -- what we  also know -- that the Central and Eastern European countries  have to be placed on an equal basis politically, but the  political, economic, and legal criteria of membership have to be  defined. It will be possible to differentiate between the  candidate countries on the basis of these criteria. This is the  essence of Lamassoure's view. In my view, this is basically  favorable for us. [passage omitted]    [MAGYAR NEMZET] Can we hope that, after the association  agreement becoming effective and submitting our application for  membership, our integration into Europe can be speeded up in  other areas, too?    [Martonyi] This is indeed an important connection. In  addition to what we have already mentioned, it also has to be  seen that one of the roles of the membership application is that  it forces both sides (us and the Union) to face up to our  historical responsibility. We can do one thing, namely force  the other side to make decisions and to give answers. This is  something that is very important. If we want to gain the status  of official candidate, then we force the European Union to give  an answer. We feel that we can also contribute to the thought  process that has now begun in preparation for the 1996  conference, and the subject of this is what kind of Europe we  want: A more united, efficient, and democratic Europe, or are  we envisaging a different kind of integration. At the moment,  the debate is on what status the European Union's associate  members should have in the West European Union. I always say  that we have to try to further the whole process, and rather  than forging ahead as an arrowhead, we want to move forward  along the whole front. Therefore, I believe that we have to see  the connections between the various goals. Unfortunately, we  also have to mention that, here and now, in the Eastern European  situation, the elements of unpredictability and uncertainty are  present and only certain indications of these have surfaced for  the time being; and I believe that this whole issue is also a  factor that speeds up integration. The Balladur plan can also  be one of these factors. One of the reasons I say that we would  like a united Union is because I believe that this is the only  solution to the Hungarian national dilemma: On one hand,  transferring a significant part of national sovereignty to the  Union and a broader application of subsidiarity on the other,  which can also help increase the independence of local  communities. This has preconditions, and a long and slow  process is needed here because Eastern-Central Europe cannot  forget its history and tensions overnight. In my view, the  Balladur plan has a chance if it tries to help in this. This is  very difficult and has to face many obstacles and mistrust, and  this includes the Hungarian side. Naturally, we are also afraid  that the plan will finally change in such a way that it loses it  original essence, namely that we have to find a solution to the  national minority issue by listening to the minorities and  allowing national minority rights to prevail. This is the  essence of the issue. In addition to this, we can also talk  about everything. The success of the plan will not depend on  us. Undoubtedly, if the Balladur plan is implemented, then this  will be a step towards EU membership for all countries.    [MAGYAR NEMZET] Which institution will coordinate the  Hungarian actions toward the Union after the application is  submitted? How will we attune our economic and other  legislation with the European Union's legal provisions?    [Martonyi] We already have the answer to this, namely Law  No. 1 of 1994, which announced our association agreement,  contains a second and a third paragraph stating that, on one  hand, the associate agreement has to be taken into account when  making international agreements and, on the other -- and this is  more important -- the requirements of coordination and  conformity with the Union's laws have to be taken into  consideration in all future Hungarian legislation. As an  institution, I believe that the basic responsibility belongs to  the Hungarian Parliament. A parliamentary decision is needed to  submit the membership application -- from a legal point of view,  this is actually the initiation of an international agreement.  This undoubtedly comes under Parliament's sphere of authority.  Parliament will also have to decide on specially important  issues in the future. In addition to this, the executive power  is responsible for carrying the whole process, in cooperation  and coordination with Parliament and its committees. Statements  of a domestic political nature have indeed appeared in the  press. I am asking all participants -- if I may put it this way  -- not to create a domestic political issue out of this, on  either side. This is a fundamental interest and it has to be  completed; if it is supported by all parties then it is  everyone's merit and responsibility, and it should be accepted  with a near unanimous parliamentary decision. I note that this  would also be very favorable for the assessment of the  application because we have always presented this as a national  consensus. I believe that we have been justified in doing so  because we have always agreed on the essence of this issue with  all parties.</p>

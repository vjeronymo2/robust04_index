			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / Survey of Spain (5): Practices under threat - Impact of the anti-trust authority WHEN the government last year published a bold convergence programme to put the country on track for the EC's economic and monetary union, Spain's fledgling anti-trust authority was given a high profile and a large brief. The local equivalent of the UK's Office for Fair Trading, known as the Tribunal de Defensa de la Competencia, was called on to study price fixing, monopolies and restrictions on professional activities and to identify the inflationary impact of such activities. The tribunal, chaired by Mr Miguel Angel Fernandez Ordonez, a former treasury official and executive director of the International Monetary Fund, has proved equal to the challenge. At the end of last month the Economy Ministry was already presenting a legislative package based on the tribunal's recommendations to the Madrid parliament. It seeks to overhaul restrictive practices in professions ranging from lawyers and architects to dentists and customs agents. The ministry has in the meantime received a second weighty report that reviews price-fixing and other cartel practices in various sectors including telecommunications, electricity distribution, transport and real estate. Mr Fernandez Ordonez, the tribunal's president, delights in the workload that he and his 35-strong staff have taken on: 'In Spain we have many more restrictions than in Europe or the US.' There is every reason for the government to keep commissioning papers from the tribunal, for Mr Fernandez Ordonez to motivate his aides into rapidly delivering the reports and for the government to act speedily on the advice it receives. There is a two-track inflation in Spain: one, which is low and accounts for price rises in industrial sectors that are open to competition, and another that is extraordinarily high and belongs to the service sector activities that are currently under the tribunal's scrutiny. 'In the areas that concern me,' says Mr Fernandez Ordonez, 'it is as if the European Community and the single market never happened.' The duality is revealed in a chart showing price rises in services and industry that takes a base of 100 in August 1983. Inflation in both sectors rose evenly until Spain joined the EC in 1986. From then on, the trends are markedly divergent. At the end of 1992, prices in the industrial sector had risen to just over 140. Those in the service sector had shot up to almost 230. For Mr Fernandez Ordonez, as indeed for the government, it is a self-evident truth that domestic inflation will be radically improved just as soon as there is a thoroughgoing deregulation of the service sector which will expose it, as has occurred in the industrial sector, to the full impact of competition. The professions, which constitute a set of strong pressure groups in Spain as in everywhere else, were a useful starting point for the tribunal, with the break-up of their restrictive practices receiving a full airing in the press. Among the recommendations adopted by the government were measures that seek to end a ban on publicity, a ruling that limits the number of lawyers in a single law firm to 20 and a strict set of demarcation practices that forbids a law firm to do business outside its own judicial area, normally the province where the firm is registered. The tribunal has also trained its sights on the system by which architects' fees for new building projects are fixed at between 5-8 per cent of the value of the development. As a result, the very notion of a competitive price is studiously ignored. Mr Fernandez Ordonez is rightly suspicious of the rigidities that shackle the real estate sector. Zoning regulations, he admits, are entirely necessary but he stresses that in Spain, with local town and village councils wielding huge power over who builds what and where, such regulations have gone from the sublime to the ridiculous. Spain, for example, has one of the lowest ratios in Europe of petrol stations per cars. This was the result of a government-controlled petrol distribution monopoly that was abolished two years ago in accordance with an EC directive. Contrary to expectations, there has not been a proliferation of new stations as obtaining the required permit from the local authority is complex and, above all, costly. Excessive rigidity in the real estate sector meant that office rents soared in the late 1980s when demand was high. When all the zoning hurdles were overcome and offices finally came on the market, Spain was entering a recession and demand had slumped. Madrid has gone from having very few and very expensive business locations to having a lot of empty ones. Is the tribunal taking on too much? Mr Fernandez Ordonez is infectiously optimistic about his brief. In addition to the government's backing, he believes that Spanish society as a whole passionately wants as much deregulation as possible. 'Spaniards are crazy about liberty and are all for it. This is precisely because they have for so long been forced to live with so much corporatism.'</p>

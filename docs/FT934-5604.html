			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Economic Diary The main economic event in the UK this week is the chancellor's budget statement tomorrow. This will outline changes to taxation and spending, as well as setting out the government's medium term financial strategy. It comes in a quiet week for UK statistics with today's provisional narrow money supply the only official figure of any note. The purchasing managers' index is released on Wednesday. Although the survey has only a limited track record, it is growing in popularity as a guide to economic activity. Many analysts expect it to maintain last month's rebound, with both the orders and output figures broadly the same. The more established US version - the National Association of Purchasing Managers Index - is also out on Wednesday. Watched closely as an early indicator of manufacturing health, it is expected to show that orders and output are still buoyant, while prices may fall for the third successive month. A Bundesbank meeting on Thursday and US jobless figures on Friday add to the week's interest. Non-farm payrolls are expected to rise by about 175,000. There is a steady stream of data in Germany this week, to accompany the central bank's council meeting. Economists believe the real economy data will show that activity remains sluggish, with no signs of recovery but no signs of a double dip either.</p>

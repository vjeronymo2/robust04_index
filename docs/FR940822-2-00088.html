These persons are on notice of the proposed rollup transaction when they purchase their limited partnership interests and, therefore, do not need the same type of protections granted to existing limited partners. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> `` <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Limited Partnership Rollup Transaction <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> '' is defined in new Subsection (b)(2)(B)(vii), in accordance with the Rollup Reform Act, as a transaction involving the combination or reorganization of limited partnerships, either directly or indirectly, where some or all investors in the limited partnerships receive new securities or securities in another entity. The definition provides exceptions for certain kinds of private transactions or other transactions which do not require the application of the protections of the Exchange Act. In addition, the term ``limited partnership rollup transaction'' is defined to include the reorganization of a single limited partnership, directly or indirectly, in which some or all investors receive new securities or securities in another entity, if the transaction meets certain specified criteria in the Rollup Reform Act. The definition covers both transactions in which securities received in single or multiple partnership rollups are received directly, and transactions in which securities are received indirectly through a step transaction. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 32 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 32 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See discussion of umbrella partnership real estate investment trusts (``UPREITs'')  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> infra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  n. 50 and accompanying text. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Exclusions  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The definition of ``limited partnership rollup transaction'' also incorporates six exclusions, in accordance with the Rollup Reform Act. A transaction will not be deemed to be a limited partnership rollup transaction of it: (1) involves only a limited partnership or partnerships having an operating policy or practice of retaining cash available for distribution and reinvesting proceeds from the sale, financing, or refinancing of assets in accordance with such criteria as the Commission determines appropriate; (2) involves only limited partnerships wherein the interests of the limited partners are repurchased, recalled, or exchanged in accordance with the terms of the preexisting limited partnership agreements for securities in an operating company specifically identified at the time of the formation of the original limited partnership; (3) involves only securities to be issued or exchanged that are not required to be and are not registered under the Securities Act of 1933 (``Securities Act''); (4) involves only issuers that are not required to register or report under Section 12 of the Exchange Act, both before and after the transaction; (5) involves the combination or reorganization of one or more limited partnerships in which a non-affiliated party succeeds to the interests of a general partner or sponsor, except those types of transactions as the Commission may by rule deem to fall within the definition of ``limited partnership rollup transaction,'' if: (a) such action is approved by not less than 662/3 percent of the outstanding units of each of the participating limited partnerships; and (b) as a result of the transaction, the existing general partners will receive only compensation to which they are entitled as expressly provided for in the preexisting limited partnership agreements; or (6) involves a transaction, except as the Commission may by rule deem to fall within the definition of ``limited partnership rollup transaction,'' in which the securities offered to investors are securities of another entity that are reported under a transaction reporting plan declared effective by the Commission under Section 11A of the Exchange Act before the date of enactment of the Rollup Reform Act, if: (a) such other entity was formed, and such class of securities was reported and regularly traded, not less than 12 months before the date on which soliciting material is mailed to investors; and (b) the securities of that entity issued to investors in the transaction do not exceed 20 percent of the total outstanding securities of the entity, exclusive of any securities of such class held by or for the account of the entity or a subsidiary of the entity. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> B. Participation in Rollups <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission is soliciting comment on the Differential Compensation Amendment. As noted above, the Differential Compensation Amendment would amend Subsection (b)(6) to: (i) limit the scope of the prohibition upon receipt of differential compensation to transactions constituting ``limited partnership rollup transactions'' instead of transactions constituting ``rollups of direct participation programs''; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 33 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and (ii) prohibit the participation of members and persons associated with members in a limited partnership rollup transaction unless the transaction includes provisions designed to protect the rights of limited partners. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 34 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 33 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Section 34(a)(2) defines ``direct participation program'' as ``a program which provides for flow-through tax consequences  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> regardless of the structure of the legal entity or vehicle for distribution <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> .&blank;.&blank;.&blank;.'' (emphasis added). By contrast, new Subsection (b)(2)(B)(vi) defines ``limited partnership'' as a DPP  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> organized as a limited partnership <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> .

Subsections (b)(6)(A) and (B) currently regulate only a member's receipt of differential compensation in the solicitation of votes or tenders. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report]  <H6>  THE STAR </H6>   Election Progress After Bophuthatswana Unrest -- Referring  to  the unrest in Bophuthatswana, Johannesburg THE STAR in English  on 14 March in a page-10 editorial says: "The main winner, now  visible through the smoke and blood of battered Mmabatho, is  South Africa's transition." "Two great obstacles have been  removed from the path to democracy. First, citizens of the  territory will be able to vote in the election, as is their  right." Second, the "white rightwing now has an electoral  vehicle," in the form of the Freedom Front, and "the continuing  coherence of the Freedom Alliance is in question." The  "authority of the Transitional Executive Council [TEC] was  enhanced, and the SADF [South African Defense Force] was shown  to be willing to obey constitutional authority. The country  stared once more at the spectre of civil war, and shrank back.  It was an awful way to achieve progress, but that is the  outcome."  <H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>   TEC Responsible for Ensuring Free Political Activity in  kwaZulu -- "The blame for what happened in Bop [Bophuthatswana]  lies squarely at the door of ousted President Lucas Mangope; the  ANC [African National Congress] exploited his autocratic  obstinacy and South Africa's lack of resolve, and is now  claiming a splendid political victory," notes Johannesburg  BUSINESS DAY in English on 14 March in a page-18 editorial.  "The confrontation over democracy in Bophuthatswana should have  happened long ago. A political ultimatum, backed by the threat  of financial sanctions and military intervention, would have  saved the lives and property lost in the past few days. Instead  the TEC and the Independent Electoral Commission [IEC], charged  with ensuring free political activity, shied away from  conflict." As for the people in kwaZulu, they "have the same  right to vote as people in Bophuthatswana. If they are denied  it, there will be the same confrontation and for the same  reasons. Whether or not Inkatha participates in the election,  the TEC and the IEC need to make it clear now that they will  act, forcibly if needs be, to ensure free political activity."  <H6>  SOWETAN </H6>   Government, TEC Action Needed Against Election Spoilers --  Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 14 March in a page-10  editorial says Bophuthatswana's Lucas Mangope "contributed  largely to his own downfall" by announcing, "in the face of a  paralysing strike by the homeland's civil servants, that there  would be no elections in Bophuthatswana and, by implication, no  re-incorporation into South Africa." "The key lesson of  Bophuthatswana is that nobody should be allowed to mess with the  lives of ordinary people and hold to ransom the democratic  process. The Government and the TEC will have to act with much  greater speed and ruthlessness against others who, for instance,  are going to attempt to sabotage the April elections. If they  don't act, they can be sure the people will."  <H6>  SUNDAY NATION </H6>   Don't Postpone Elections -- Johannesburg SUNDAY NATION in  English on 13 March in a page-6 editorial notes that the Inkatha  Freedom Party (IFP) and General Constand Viljoen's Freedom Front  "are now asking for the postponement of the election date."  "Clearly, since the ANC has agreed that there should be  mediation, we can only assume that it also understands that,  should such mediation not deliver by April 27, there will be no  election on that date. On the other hand, should mediation bear  fruit in a month the ANC must understand that it will not be  able to convince the IFP to take part in the polls, because  Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi will -- as he has already done --  argue that he has not had enough time to campaign." Therefore,  "whether we grant a volkstaat [homeland], give Natal to Chief  Buthelezi, follow the transitional constitution or stay as we  are -- conflict is inevitable, because neither of the above will  ever satisfy spoilers."</p>

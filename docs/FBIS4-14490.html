			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast: Video report on Theoretical </F> and Experimental Physics Institute's work on safe nuclear  reactors by Vladimir Polozhentsev, identified by caption]    [Excerpts] [Polozhentsev] The problem of safe nuclear power  stations is a worldwide concern today. In ordinary nuclear  reactors the chain reaction sets in after the fuel rods have  been lowered in, and it is controlled automatically by means of  special absorbers. However, the regulation of this process  cannot be 100-percent reliable. In the event of a malfunction a  reactor runaway can occur, which is very difficult to halt.    In the nuclear-electric installation proposed by scientists  at the Theoretical and Experimental Physics Institute the chain  reaction is triggered by a powerful proton beam directed at a  beryllium target from which it knocks out neutrons. The same  physical processes take place, but they can be halted at any  moment by switching off the electricity, for example.    [V.V. Vasilyev, deputy head of a Theoretical and  Experimental  Physics Institute laboratory] Given funding and two and a half  years of work, the installation could be ready for physical  startup.    [Polozhentsev] But funding is a problem at the Institute.  Because of the low wages, talented staff are leaving for  commercial ventures. Five billion rubles are needed to complete  the work on the accelerator. Meanwhile "Mosenergo" is  threatening to cut off electricity in the near future as a  result of unpaid electricity bills. [passage omitted]    [Polozhentsev] Despite all the problems, Russian nuclear  physicists are continuing to perfect the linear proton  accelerator. It will now depend on the government how  successful their efforts are.</p>

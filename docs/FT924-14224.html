			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Arts: Truth disguised - Poetry THE Slovenian poet Tomaz Salamun belongs to that post-war generation of eastern European poets who grew up in a climate of intellectual dishonesty. Stalinist societies in which public proclamations, always rosily optimistic, bore little relation to the material and spiritual deprivations that they experienced in their daily lives. The result was to drive the writers - and the way they approached the problems of writing - underground. Direct rebellion might be impossible, but important truths could be told - and in Salamun's case, these were presented through a strange mixture of whimsical, playful and almost absurd statements, too slippery for any censor to take hold of. Salamun's reading at the Voice Box this month - his first in London for many years - tended to emphasise these characteristics of his poetry. Speaking almost in an undertone, he read the majority of the poems in English translation, which he spoke with an exaggeratedly careful emphasis. The strange, fractured poems themselves, full of absurd humour, were quite the antithesis of his sombre, formal appearance. One of the longest and most accessible, The Fish, described, through a sequence of starkly memorable statements - 'My names are all dirty'; 'On some planet there is a central storehouse for my flesh' - a feeling of worthlessness that seemed to border on the psychotic. The title of another demonstrated just how playfully ironic Salamun could be: 'Hear me out, the world is not in danger.' When one's inner and outer worlds are under threat, the best way of drawing attention to that fact might be to say the opposite. Reading alongside Tomaz Salamun at the Voice Box that evening was Jo Shapcott, a young English poet whose new collection, Phrase Book, was this quarter's choice of the Poetry Book Society. With hair flicked back behind her ears, and properly earthed in Rumpelstiltskin boots, she seems to blaze with self-confidence - but, if anything, the strength and sureness of her delivery draws too much attention to the empty cleverness of her poetry. The reading becomes an exercise in ensuring that the audience understands exactly as much as it needs to in order to enjoy her poems to the full. The poems all purported to be funny, with the poet entering into the psyches of various sheep, a goat, Tom (of Tom and Jerry), Superman (in a bad mood), a lettuce and a mad cow in order to describe for us how those various animals and American cultural icons might feel and respond if they had the kind of sophisticated intellect with which we humans are blessed. Unfortunately, the jokes were often not good enough; and in one of the 'cow' poems, the listener forgot entirely that the speaker was supposed to be a cow at all. Jo Shapcott is a clever, artful constructor of poems - but sometimes her head rules her heart and the sense of humour gets lost altogether. Charlie 'C K' Williams is one of the most distinctive American voices of our time, and he is a rare, satisfying example of a poet who manages fully to embody his poems in the reading of them. The poet is in a state of extreme nervous agitation as he reads, perpetually twisting his long neck from side, and pumping his shoe as if depressing some imaginary organ pedal. 'I decided it was time to get a handle on jealousy,' he tells us, grinning, before he attacks a poem entitled 'The Mirror', one of no fewer than 14 attempts to get to grips with this subject in his new collection, A Dream of Mind. His poetic lines are unusually long, and this adds to the sense of frenetic drama in his mid-western voice. Every poem sounds like the last few desperate furlongs of a close, hard-driven race, whether the subject matter be a tramp or an analysis of the properties of the mind. The words themselves seem to resonate through his body, causing every limb to twitch and jerk. He is a poet to be read in gulps - desperate, driven, obsessive, By the end the audience, mesmerised, is pawing the ground with its feet. The Selected Poems of Tomaz Salamun are published by Ecco Press, New York. Phrase Book by Jo Shapcott is published by Oxford University Press at Pounds 5.99. A Dream of Mind is published by Bloodaxe Books at Pounds 6.95.</p>

Yongchaiyut: The situation is certainly not out of  hand yet. We have several devices we can employ to help us spy  on the terrorists, such as an electronic device which can be  placed on any concrete wall less than one-foot thick. That  device will enable us to hear the conversations of the people  behind the wall. However, terrorists could also monitor our  electronic eavesdropping tools or communications equipment.    THE NATION: So, terrorists will know more about  the movement of police from the department's equipment than the  police will learn about the criminals. Is that right.    Yongchaiyut: That's it.</p>

There was no report of casualties from Tuesday night's  clashes, according to the witnesses reached by telephone.    Armed police were out in force and shops closed in the  capital Sanaa on Wednesday during peaceful protests.    The demonstrations followed a fall in the value of the riyal  which has pushed up consumer prices.    It was trading at more than 70 to the dollar on the black  market this week, compared with 60 a week ago. The official is  rate is 12 to the dollar.    The central bank has been unable to prop up the riyal  because  of its meagre foreign currency reserves.    The economic situation has been exacerbated by a long  running  dispute between President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, a northerner,  and his deputy, 'Ali Salim al-Bid, a southerner, over how to run  the country.    Yemen, in the southwest corner of the Arabian peninsula, is  one of the world's poorest countries, with a per capita income  of 500 dollars per year.</p>

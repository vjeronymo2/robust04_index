			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / International Company News: Parker Pen takeover to be contested in US THE US Department of Justice announced yesterday it would file an anti-trust suit to prevent Boston-based Gillette from purchasing Parker Pen on the grounds that such a sale would have an anti-competitive effect on the market for premium fountain pens. The suit could block Gillette's attempt to become the world's largest seller of all types of pens. Gillette holds approximately 7 per cent of the world pen market, while its leading competitor, Societe BIC, holds about 8 per cent. With Parker, Gillette would control 15 per cent of the world market. The Justice Department contends that Gillette and Parker, together with one other company, control 80 per cent of the premium fountain pen market. Under the agreement negotiated by the two companies in September, the deal will be voided if there is still any litigation pending in May. Gillette believes the purchase will not have an anti-competitive effect. The company expressed disappointment with the government's decision to go ahead with the suit. They said that 80 per cent of Parker pens were sold outside the US, and the governments of the UK, France, Germany and Canada had approved the sale. Gillette sees the purchase of Parker as a way to round out its existing product line.</p>

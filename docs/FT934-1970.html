			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Mapping out sales to India - Stefan Wagstyl examines a computer system which is set to transform marketing to rural communities Farming families living in the dusty village of Chajjahpur on the plains of northern India only buy a few dozen bars of soap and packets of detergent a week from Haresh Kumar's shop. It is five miles from the dirt tracks of Chajjahpur to the nearest metalled road and ten miles to the nearest town. But 700 miles away in Bombay a man with a computer is keeping tabs on Mr Kumar's sales. With a few taps on his keyboard, Rajendra Aneja can call up a map of India on his computer screen. A few more taps and he gets a blow-up of a single state, then a district, then a group of villages and the roads and tracks which connect them. Points show the location of individual shops. If he chooses, Mr Aneja can pick out Chajjahpur and the small store Mr Kumar inherited from his father as a blob on the map. As general sales manager of Hindustan Lever, India's largest consumer goods maker and the local affiliate of Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch combine, Mr Aneja is putting the finishing touches to a system which he believes could transform rural marketing in India - and in other large developing countries. By displaying individual villages and roads on an electronic map, he and his colleagues can plot the best way to supply and service a vast network of rural outlets. Hindustan Lever, which has developed the system over the past three years, is gradually extending the use of computerised maps. Unilever group executives are so impressed with the scheme's potential that they have already offered it to Unilever affiliates elsewhere. 'Ours is the only system of its kind in the world,' claims Mr Aneja. Details of the mapping techniques are a commercial secret. But, in general, the information for the maps is gathered mainly by the company's 2,300 stockists - self-employed wholesalers who often work exclusively for Hindustan Lever. They file hand-written sales reports which form the basis of the computer data. The crucial advantage of the map displays is that they enable managers to see at a glance information which would otherwise be buried in separate files. If the network operates as planned, it will reinforce the crucial bridge between head office managers and the customer - a link which is particularly difficult to maintain in developing countries with large rural populations and poor communications. It will also help Hindustan Lever to bring to bear a formidable range of marketing techniques as - following the partial liberalisation of the Indian economy - the company prepares for full-blown competition with its international rivals, notably Procter &amp; Gamble of the US. Rural markets are mushrooming in India for basic household goods such as packaged foods, soaps, detergents, and cosmetics. In Chajjahpur, population 8,000, there are now 25 shops. With over 600m of India's 900m people living in the villages, the potential demand is enormous. The actual demand is growing fast as some 15m people a year are entering into the cash economy, according to Hindustan Lever. The company estimates rural sales are growing twice as fast as urban - or at about 15 per cent a year. Hindustan Lever has the country's largest sales network, serving 40 per cent of the population. By 1995 it hopes to serve 70 per cent - reaching every village with a population of 1,000 or more, via its network of stockists. The stockists visit outlets weekly in urban areas and once a fortnight in the villages, bringing goods mainly by van or scooter. In remote roadless districts, suppliers resort to donkeys, camels and even elephants. In urban districts, marketing is mainly carried out through television, radio and newspaper advertisements. But Mr Aneja estimates 400m people, mainly those in small villages, have little or no access to the mainstream media. To reach these people, marketing executives rely heavily on word-of-mouth. Mr Aneja says that when Mrs Indira Gandhi was assassinated news of her death reached even remote villages in six hours. Product information will not travel nearly as fast, but it will be conveyed, for example, by shopkeepers like Mr Kumar in Chajjahpur who travel frequently to buy goods from wholesalers. Hindustan Lever supports its retailers with direct campaigns in the villages. The group has 1,200 promotion vans, mounted with loudspeakers and painted with advertisements for its best-selling brands such as Lifebuoy soap and Rin laundry soap. When one called in Chajjahpur recently, the salesman's job was to promote Rin. He produced a dirty handkerchief and proceeded to launder it in front of about 20 bored-looking villagers. When he had finished he offered Rin for sale, with a free box of matches. He sold about 10 bars and moved on. Hindustan Lever also has a fleet of 115 cinema vans, each equipped with a projector and screen. The vans show clips of Indian films interspersed with advertisement films. Mr Aneja says these films are specially-made for rural audiences. The 10-second long television advertisements are too short; villagers need films of at least a minute or two if they are to get the message. A typical advertisement shows two village wrestlers grappling, one in a snow-white loin cloth the other in a greyish one. Needless to say, the man in white wins. The loser's wife scowls at the winner's and says: 'You must have washed his clothes twice.' The winner's wife answers: 'No. I just used Rin.' Mr Aneja says rural advertisements must carry simple messages. He argues that villagers, like anyone else, will quickly associate with familiar images - scenes from popular cinema films, from religious stories, from dances and folk customs, all work well. Among the advantages of the new computerised maps is that Hindustan Lever will be able to target its marketing campaigns more accurately. Executives will be able to plan the routes for the promotional and cinema vans more effectively and to judge the results more easily. As Mr Aneja says: 'We have to combine twentieth century methods with the needs of eighteenth century village life.'</p>

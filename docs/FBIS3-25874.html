			<p>Language: <F P=105> Mandarin </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ho Chien-min; from the "Hookup" program] </F>   [Text] On the eve of the Chiao-Tang talks between the  Straits Exchange Foundation [SEF] and the Association for  Relations Across the Taiwan Strait [ARATS], which will take  place in Beijing today, Vice Chairman of the Mainland Affairs  Council [MAC] Kao Kung-lien yesterday said: Communist China has  not lessened its hostility to us; in fact, it has begun acting  without commenting on its military preparations against Taiwan.  This action by our compatriots is something we should be alert  to.    The Chiao-Tang talks between the two organizations will be  held soon. On the eve of the talks MAC Vice Chairman Kao  Kung-lien said his group considered the meeting a routine one to  discuss low-level and economic matters and he did not expect  much from it.    [Begin Kao recording] The SEF and the ARATS will soon hold a  five-day meeting in Beijing. The meeting will mainly discuss  routine and economic matters. Meanwhile, we hope the two sides  can further exchange views on problems and obstacles faced by  the meeting. [end recording]    Vice Chairman Kao Kung-lien also made a statement in the  light of Communist China's current policy toward Taiwan. He  said: Following the Ku-Wang meeting, Communist China has  repeatedly said that the era of using dialogue to solve disputes  has come; however, Communist China's hostility against us has  not lessened. According to MAC's understanding, Communist China  has adopted dual tactics in dealing with Taiwan. On the one  hand it uses its open policy in economic affairs to attract  Taiwan businessmen and absorb capital from Taiwan, on the other  hand it has begun acting without commenting on its military  preparations for aggression [qin lue] against Taiwan.    [Begin Kao recording] They have realized that the work of  peaceful reunification cannot be accomplished quickly, but they  have also stressed that the matter must not be delayed and have  called for a sense of urgency. Their inner circle [nei pu],  therefore, has repeatedly threatened to maintain its military  menace toward Taiwan. In order to stop this threat causing  Taiwan businessmen to hesitate or shift funds to other places,  they have also stressed that preparations for a military  struggle [chun shih tou cheng] should be extremely calm and  collected [pu tung sheng se], be solid, and done without saying  anything. [end recording]    Vice Chairman Kao Kung-lien emphatically pointed out that it  was precisely because of Communist China's hard line attitude  that exchanges between the two sides of the strait should  continue to be conducted prudently.</p>

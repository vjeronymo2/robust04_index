			<p><P> April 24, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NAMIBIA JOINS THE U.N. AS 160TH MEMBER STATE;  </P> <P> THIRD WORLD: THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY SESSION WILL CONCENTRATE ON THE PLIGHT OF  POOR NATIONS.  </P> <P> Namibia joined the United Nations on Monday as its 160th member state and  promised, as a small nation, to do "do our little bit" toward maintaining world  peace.  </P> <P> The admission of the former German colony, ruled by South Africa for the past  75 years, coincided with the opening of a five-day special session of the  General Assembly called to seek ways to lift the burden of poverty and a  $1.3-trillion debt from the developing world.  </P> <P> As the blue, red and green Namibian flag rose between those of Nicaragua and  New Zealand, the new country's prime minister, Hage G. Geingob, received  congratulations from Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar and other  officials of the world organization, which for four decades has been the chief  advocate of Namibian independence.  </P> <P> At a news conference later, Geingob cited his country's place in the ranks of  the Third World. He said that, while it is better off than many of its African  neighbors, it will begin its independence with an inherited deficit of $192  million. He said trade with South Africa will have to continue in spite of  Namibia's disapproval of its former ruler's system of apartheid but that  full-fledged diplomatic ties between the two cannot come until apartheid ends.  </P> <P> "Even our food, at the moment, comes from South Africa," Geingob said.  </P> <P> Geingob said he hopes that an international oil embargo applied to Namibia as  part of South Africa will be lifted soon. Doubt remains about this, however,  because all ocean shipments must come through Walvis Bay, a deep-water port  that South Africa has retained in the face of Namibia's claim to the facility.  </P> <P> As debate began on the special session's theme of "revitalization of economic  growth" of the world's poor nations, an unspoken fear among them was that the  task of rebuilding Eastern Europe dominates the West's attention today, at the  expense of the Third World. West German Minister for Economic Cooperation  Juergen Warnke sought to reassure the latter.  </P> <P> "The upswing that Eastern Europe will experience with the reintroduction of  market economies will bring demand for goods from the Third World," Warnke  predicted.  </P> <P> The presence here together of Warnke and his East German counterpart, Hans  Wilhelm Ebeling, was seen as an indication of growing cooperation between the  two Germanys. The two ministers traveled here on a West German air force plane  and paid a joint visit to Perez de Cuellar.  </P></p>

			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / International Company News: US drugs group signs hospital contract Abbott Laboratories, the Illinois-based healthcare company, yesterday signed a Dollars 500m contract with SunHealth Alliance of Charlotte, North Carolina. The move adds momentum to the US trend of creating package deals for US health service suppliers. The agreement includes pharmaceuticals, diagnostics, drug delivery systems, intravenous solutions, nutritionals, medical-surgical products, critical care and anaesthesia products. The 280-hospital five-year deal is the latest in a series which usually involves big discounts for the purchasers in return for preferential buying from one supplier such as Abbott. In August 1993, US healthcare company Bristol-Myers Squibb signed a five-year contract to set up preferred status for its products with American Healthcare Systems of San Diego, California. AHS has more than 1,000 hospitals, and the deal was one of the biggest yet signed. These arrangements represent an alternative approach to that followed by Merck, the biggest drugs company in the US, which in July 1993 paid Dollars 6bn for drugs distributor Medco Containment Services. These deals respond to changing healthcare markets, and anticipate the reform of healthcare proposed by the Clinton administration.</p>

			<p><P> November 8, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> POWAY GETS A THIRD CHANCE AT TORREY PINES  </P> <P> Torrey Pines High and Poway High will meet in finals of the San Diego Section  girls' tennis 3-A playoffs for the second year in a row and fourth time in six  years.  </P> <P> In the 2-A finals, La Jolla will make its 12th appearance in 13 years against  first-time participant San Pasqual. La Jolla has won nine championships.  </P> <P> All four schools advanced by winning semifinal matches Wednesday. The finals  are Saturday at the Canyon Hills Tennis Club with the 2-A beginning at noon and  the 3-A at 3 p.m.  </P> <P> Top-seeded Torrey Pines defeated No. 4 Mira Mesa, 13-5. No. 2 Poway advanced  over No. 3 Bonita Vista, 11-7, by winning seven of nine doubles matches.  </P> <P> Poway, the 1989 champion, had just three starters returning this year so it was  a bit of a surprise to Coach Evi Yarnell that her team again would make the  finals this year.  </P> <P> "The kids from the JV worked very hard in the off-season," Yarnell said. "They  improved tremendously, and we had a very good year."  </P> <P> Still, Yarnell said, it will be difficult to upset Torrey Pines, which soundly  defeated Poway twice during the regular season. "We have nothing to lose,"  Yarnell said.  </P> <P> Poway's Tasha Frantz won all three of her sets, but the Titans fell behind 4-5  heading into doubles, where Leah Splavec-Katy Heydon and Jenny Bearden-Missy  Dulac swept six matches to clinch the victory.  </P> <P> In the 2-A semifinals, top-seeded La Jolla (21-1) advanced easily defeating  three-time defending champion Bishop's, 14-4. The Vikings' LeeAnn Rostovsky,  Lynn Coakley and Renee Gold swept nine singles sets. Bishop's finished 15-6.  </P> <P> No. 2 San Pasqual, which narrowly avoided an upset Tuesday beating Coronado by  an eight-game tiebreaker, had another close one Wednesday, winning 10-8 over  USDHS (13-4).  </P> <P> The Eagles' top two players, Molly Gavin and Britt Stenstrom, swept their  singles matches to give San Pasqual a 6-3 lead. Paloma Vanderzanden and Amber  Gonzalez teamed to win two of three doubles sets. Andrea Phillips-Jennifer  Mulder and Annette Stehly-Summer Tubbs won their final doubles sets to win it  for San Pasqual (21-1).  </P> <P> Volleyball Playoffs  </P> <P> Division II First Round  </P> <P> Torrey Pines d.

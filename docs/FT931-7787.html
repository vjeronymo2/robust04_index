			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / Major treads softly in special new relationship MR John Major, the British prime minister, will tomorrow warn President Bill Clinton that any attempt by the US administration to re-open last year's US-EC farm trade accord would wreck hopes of a successful conclusion to the Gatt trade talks. As Mr Major prepared for his first meeting with President Clinton, senior British officials said that he regarded a commitment not to unpick the so-called Blair House accords on agricultural subsidies as an absolute pre-condition for an eventual agreement to wind up the Uruguay Round. Mr Major hopes in tomorrow's White House talks to present himself as an honest broker in resolving the latest range of trade disputes between Brussels and Washington. In that capacity he will warn that several EC states - most notably France - would seize on any fresh US doubts about Blair House to unravel the farm trade deal and wipe out prospects of a global trade agreement. The prime minister will make much of the damaging impact that would have on international economic growth prospects, particularly in the developing world. The stalled Gatt talks - and the separate US-EC disputes over European steel exports and public procurement policies - will take up much of the scheduled six hours of talks between the two leaders. Britain has welcomed President Clinton's decision to seek an extension from Congress of fast-track authority for the trade talks. Mr Major will emphasise that he believes a deal is still possible this year. Foreign policy issues may prove less contentious at this week's meeting than previously feared. Mr Clinton's position on Bosnia has shifted since he took office in the direction favoured by the UK, although he is understood to remain anxious to do more to reverse ethnic cleansing. One such action might be the plan Mr Clinton floated over the weekend to parachute food and medical supplies into areas of Bosnia that have been cut off from relief by road. But Mr Clinton is not expected to press ahead with this proposal, which is not viewed favourably by United Nations forces in the region, until he has met with Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, today. Despite the narrowing of Anglo-American differences over Bosnia and a striking unity of purpose in the two countries' approach to Iraq, Mr Major's officials continued to display considerable nervousness ahead of their first meeting. Amid fears that Mr Clinton might undermine Britain's claim to its much-prized special relationship, the officials took the unusual step of distancing Mr Major from help offered by the Conservative party to former President Bush's election campaign. The officials said that the despatch last year by Conservative Central Office of advisers to help the Bush campaign was approved by Sir Norman Fowler, the party chairman, without the knowledge of Mr Major. In a Washington still preoccupied with the economic plan that Mr Clinton presented to Congress last week, Mr Major's imminent arrival has yet to cause more than the faintest of blips on the political radar. While a congressional group led by Congressman Thomas Manton of New York is seeking signatures for a letter urging Mr Clinton to make Northern Ireland a top priority in US-UK relations, the president's campaign pledge to appoint a special envoy has so far elicited only a distant echo. The suggestion that Mr Thomas Foley, the Speaker of the House, might be that envoy has been discounted by Mr Foley's office, which notes that the Speaker will have quite enough work getting Mr Clinton's economic programme through Congress.</p>

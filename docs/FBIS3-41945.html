"The state of missile installations is satisfactory. We are  doing all we can and more to protect and safely store nuclear  warheads and provide strategic forces with everything they need."    He reports in a statement, released by the republic's  Defense  Ministry, that he visited a depot for nuclear warheads, removed  from missiles, and says that the purpose of his mission was to  impartially assess the state of nuclear sites.    He notes that he checked all nuclear sites at the  president's  request and in line with a special program.    "We have enough problems to resolve on the threshold of  negotiations with Russia on these issues." He revealed plans  for early talks with his Russian counterpart Pavel Grachev to  discuss a whole set of documents. "What's most important for  Ukraine and Russia is eagerness to work hard toward nuclear  disarmament," Radetskyy stressed, and warned against dramatizing  the situation, as some journalists and politicians do.    Meanwhile, the Commander of Ukraine's 43 Strategic Missile  Troops Army Vladimir Migtyuk has admitted that "technical  maintenance problems really exist." However, in his words,  "there is no reason to lay it on thick." "Nuclear facilities  are fully under control, he assured, we have all means for  that." He dismissed as far- fetched attempts to draw a parallel  to Chernobyl or anything else.    The Ukrainian Air-Force Commander Valeriy Vasilyev has  announced that the nuclear warheads on board strategic aircraft  "are reliably protected." He refuted allegations that their  condition was appalling.    Colonel Valeriy Izmalkov, a member of the Parliamentary  Commission on Defence and Security Affairs dismissed as  "absolutely baseless" some foreign assertions that Ukraine will  declassify the operative missile management codes in the coming  months.    In his words, these codes are not possible to declassify.  Only U.S. and Russian Headquarters could re-target missiles  after making essential calculations. "Ukraine is not ready for  that," Izmalkov remarked.</p>

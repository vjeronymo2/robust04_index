			<p><P> April 21, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SANDINISTA HARD-LINER MAKES PEACE VOW;  </P> <P> NICARAGUA: TOMAS BORGE, LEADER OF THE NATION'S SECURITY POLICE, BIDS FAREWELL  TO HIS TROOPS. HE PROMISES TO RELEASE POWER WITHOUT A FIGHT.  </P> <P> Comandante Tomas Borge, the hard-line Sandinista who heads Nicaragua's powerful  security police, pledged Friday to support a peaceful turnover of the  government next week to the pro-American coalition that upset his party in  national elections.  </P> <P> "Starting April 25, this institution will be subordinated to a new government  and a new minister," Borge said of the Interior Ministry he has directed, in an  emotional farewell to his troops. "This implies a difficult test for you, but  you must face it with discipline, professionalism and strict adherence to the  law and the constitution."  </P> <P> The comandante's speech, his first in public since his government lost the Feb.  25 election, dispelled any fear of high-level Sandinista resistance to the  opposition's accession to power. Borge, the sole surviving founder of the  29-year-old revolutionary movement, is considered the most rigid member of its  nine-man directorate.  </P> <P> His remarks came a day after the Sandinista army and President-elect Violeta  Barrios de Chamorro's advisers reached agreements with Contra leaders formally  ending the eight-year-old Nicaraguan war and obliging the U.S.-backed rebels to  disarm by June 10.  </P> <P> Borge said the accords proved the "ethical purposes and healthy intentions" of  some of the incoming government's leaders and removed any pretext for  challenging them with labor unrest, as some Sandinista-led unions have  threatened. He urged striking bank clerks, telephone workers and miners to  return to work.  </P> <P> "Make your best efforts, as I am doing, to assure that Mrs. Chamorro takes  possession (of the presidency)," he told hundreds of police officers and combat  troops in an hourlong outdoor ceremony. "Let me warn you against disobedience,  insubordination and disrespect."  </P> <P> The message was a stark contrast to pre-election statements by Borge and other  military leaders that their troops would never obey orders from any government  that tried to dismiss Sandinista commanders. Borge once declared that Nicaragua  would become "ungovernable" under a Chamorro administration.  </P> <P> While calling his impending dismissal a "painful moment," Borge said it would  be irresponsible of him "to ask you to leave the country's new leaders  unprotected, to let flames reduce their homes to ashes, to make life impossible  by promoting disorder. Never, under any circumstances, can you expect such  advice from me."  </P> <P> He cautioned, however, that a failure by the Contras to meet their disarmament  deadline would "completely change the rules of the game." And he spoke of  "ethical challenges" in which police officers might have to "defend (the  Chamorro government) against its own possible sins of delinquency, corruption  and abuse."  </P> <P> Borge, a spellbinding orator with a gift for poetic imagery, moved many in his  audience to tears when he vowed that the "blood of our martyrs is like a seed  that will flourish again someday, even more beautifully, in this revolutionary  land" and that the "darkness" of previous dictatorships "will never return . .  . because we have enough reserves of light."  </P> <P> He called his secret police "the best sons of the fatherland" and boasted of  how they had "outsmarted the CIA" to prevent the Contras from gaining a  foothold in the cities. He noted with pride that his forces never used gunfire  and rarely used tear gas to break up political disturbances, and that Managua  "is one of the safest cities in the world."  </P> <P> "They accuse me of having a hard hand, but people closest to me know that is  not the nature of my heart," he said. He denied being corrupt, trafficking in  drugs, owning a valuable art collection or planning to live in exile. "The  doctors who have examined me say I am healthy enough for a long life, so don't  have any illusions that I'll soon leave this world," he declared.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Reporter Zhong Weining (6988 5898 1337): "The Beijing </F> Association for Prevention and Curing of Venereal Disease and  AIDS Is Established"]    [Text] AIDS [acquired immune deficiency syndrom] cases  occurring before 1 December, World AIDS Awareness Day, have  again sounded the alarm for us.    According to the report published by the municipal  sanitation  and antiepidemic department on 25 November, ever since the  advent of AIDS in Beijing in 1985, 55 persons have been found  infected with the virus -- 32 are foreigners, 11 are from other  provinces and municipalities, and 12 are residents of Beijing.  Beijing ranks third in the country in the number of persons  infected with the AIDS virus. The first reported case of AIDS  in our country was in Beijing; the first veneral disease patient  infected with the AIDS virus was found in Beijing; and the first  overseas laborer infected with the AIDS virus was also  discovered in Beijing.    In addition, venereal disease which had basically been  eliminated in Beijing in the middle of the 1960's has revived.  It is reported that about 800 new persons have suffered from  venereal disease each year. Moreover, we have already found  cases in which children and infants are born infected with the  venereal disease.    On the one hand, analysis of the reason why Beijing ranks  third in the country in the number of persons infected by AIDS  virus is an indication of the seriousness of the threat imposed  by AIDS in Beijing. On the other hand, it also shows that the  attention of municipal government, economic input, and advanced  technology have made Beijing's AIDS discovering rate higher than  average. According to the analysis of the sanitation and  antiepidemic specialists, Beijing is a low AIDS-infected  epidemic area.    To prevent and control the spread of AIDS and venereal  disease in an even more effective manner, Beijing took the lead  in the country to set up the Beijing Association for the  Prevention and Cure of Venereal Disease and AIDS on 25 November.  Thus far, more than 70 units of 17 trades, including medical  prevention and curing, tourism, press, and civil administration,  have joined this AIDS prevention organization.</p>

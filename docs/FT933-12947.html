			<p>930722 FT  22 JUL 93 / Bankers brush aside fears over derivatives market A GROUP of the world's top bankers has brushed aside fears that the Dollars 4,000bn (Pounds 2,600bn) derivatives market threatens the international banking system. The Group of Thirty, a Washington-based think-tank chaired by Mr Paul Volcker, former head of the US Federal Reserve, concludes in a report published yesterday that no new regulations are required. However, it says market participants should implement stricter internal controls. The long-awaited recommendations on these sophisticated financial instruments contrast sharply with concerns voiced recently by Mr William McDonough, new chairman of the New York Fed, and with warnings last year by his predecessor, Mr Gerald Corrigan, that the market might be running out of control. Derivatives are instruments, such as futures, options and swaps, whose value is based on an underlying cash market in stocks, currencies, interest rates or commodities. To their supporters, they have brought greater flexibility to the management of financial risks of companies, investors, government agencies and others. To their critics, they have created complex risks that few users and traders know how to handle. The G30 concedes the instruments are complicated but rules out fresh regulatory initiatives. It calls for a deeper understanding of derivatives and says senior management should closely monitor the use of such instruments. It argues that risk is diminished if users observe strict internal controls. Mr Volcker, in a foreword to the report, says: 'The critically important contribution of this study has been to define a set of sound risk management practices for dealers and end users.' The G30 report concurs with recent reviews of derivatives by the Bank of England and the Bank for International Settlements. A Bank of England official said the G30 report seemed 'in keeping' with its own derivatives report issued in April. Many of the group's findings - that public disclosure of derivatives exposures is inadequate; that wider acceptance of multi-product netting agreements is needed; and that accounting practices for derivatives must be standardised - are not new. The report sidesteps the controversial issue of capital adequacy that underlies the unease about derivatives trading. Sir Dennis Weatherstone, chairman of investment bank JP Morgan and leader of the G30 study group on derivatives, said the main problem facing the derivatives industry had been a lack of understanding. 'We have made substantial progress in this area,' said Sir Dennis. Easy option or unnecessary risk, Page 19 G30 sets new benchmark for derivatives industry, Page 27</p>

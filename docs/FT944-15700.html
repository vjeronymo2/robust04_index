			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Equity Markets: Hong Kong - Other Markets Nerves are creeping into the market, as external influences combine with a growing realisation that south-east Asia does not have a monopoly on economic growth, writes Louise Lucas. The week will again begin with the absorption of the latest US data, with brokers looking at capacity utilisation for clues on forthcoming movements in interest rates, which could feed through to Hong Kong. Concerns are also spreading from across the border. Shanghai suffered another volatile week, in spite of official assurances of the robust health of China's leader, Deng Xiaoping. Meanwhile, a trickle of unit trust redemptions is sparking fears of a more widespread sell-off in Hong Kong. Investors are discovering growth in their own home markets, not least the US, as well as other emerging markets such as South America, eastern Europe and India. Compiled by Michael Morgan</p>

			<p><P> October 26, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> EAST GERMAN LEADERS TALK TO OPPOSITION;  </P> <P> REFORM: NEW FORUM ACTIVISTS ARE CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC AT DIALOGUE SEEKING AN  END TO POLITICAL UPHEAVAL.  </P> <P> Communist leaders in East Berlin and Dresden met opposition activists today for  the first substantive talks on how to end East Germany's worst political  upheavals in 36 years.  </P> <P> The Communist Party leader in the capital, Politburo member Guenter Schabowski,  conferred with two scientists who helped found New Forum, which claims 26,000  members and is the largest opposition group.  </P> <P> In the southern industrial city of Dresden, party leader Hans Modrow organized  a conference with opposition supporters and other local citizens. Modrow is  reputed to be the leading advocate of reform in the political establishment.  </P> <P> After his two-hour meeting with Schabowski, scientist Jens Reich told reporters  he believes the authorities are serious about starting a dialogue with the  opposition.  </P> <P> "We will see, but I would say cautiously that I have a positive impression,"  Reich said.  </P> <P> He said Schabowski had hinted at more competitive elections and a new law  permitting street demonstrations.  </P> <P> But he said Schabowski had told him and fellow scientist Sebastian Pflugbeil  that it was outside his authority to legalize New Forum.  </P> <P> The authorities are trying to overcome a crisis in which hundreds of thousands  of people, inspired by changes in the Soviet Union, Poland and Hungary, have  demonstrated for democracy this month in all big East German cities.  </P> <P> More than 120,000 of East Germany's 16.6 million people have fled to the West  this year, about half of them by crossing Hungary's border with Austria, open  since mid-September, or by seeking refuge in West German embassies in Eastern  Europe.  </P> <P> The unrest is the worst since Soviet forces suppressed a workers' uprising in  1953. It prompted the replacement of Erich Honecker as party leader last week  by Egon Krenz, who has pledged dialogue with everyone who respects East German  laws.  </P> <P> Krenz promised this week that all East Germans would soon have passports and  the right to travel without restrictions to Western countries and West Berlin.  </P> <P> But members of New Forum, a group embracing a wide spectrum of non-Communist  activists, have made clear that free travel to the West will not be enough to  satisfy their demands for change.  </P> <P> They want the lifting of media censorship, an end to official privileges,  legalization of opposition groups, a relaxation of the rigid ideological  discipline in education and free, competitive elections.  </P> <P> In East Berlin, East Germany's official lawyers' organization today demanded  liberal changes to the criminal code.  </P></p>

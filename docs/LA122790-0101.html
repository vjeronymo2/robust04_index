			<p><P> December 27, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOWL REPORT;  </P> <P> CITRUS BOWL;  </P> <P> NEBRASKA TO START GRANT AT QUARTERBACK  </P> <P> Nebraska Coach Tom Osborne named Mike Grant as his starting quarterback for the  Citrus Bowl game Tuesday in Orlando, Fla., against Georgia Tech. Osborne chose  Grant over Tom Haase after Mickey Joseph suffered a severe leg laceration in  the last game of the regular season against Oklahoma.  </P> <P> Grant was Nebraska's starter in the season opener against Baylor but had a  bruised knee that cost him the next two games. He returned as the starter in  the fourth and fifth games but was then replaced by Joseph the rest of the  regular season.  </P> <P> "It doesn't matter who the quarterback is, you've still got to stop their  offense," Georgia Tech Coach Bobby Ross said. "He's (Grant) a great football  player and has a good arm. He's a better thrower than Joseph." JOHN CHERWA  </P></p>

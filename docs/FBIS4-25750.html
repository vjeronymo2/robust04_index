			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, June 13 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President Bill  Clinton today held a welcome ceremony for Japanese Emperor  Akihito and Empress Michiko at the White House South Lawn.    "Your Majesties visit us at a moment when it is clear that  the destinies of our two peoples are inextricably linked,"  Clinton said at the ceremony attended by about 4,000 people.    "We share a common vision. It is a vision of democracy and  prosperity... [ellipses as received], of a world where we trade  freely in ideas and goods," Clinton said.    "Our commitment to common ideals is firm, our determination  to work with you is strong," Clinton added.    Emperor Akihito said that "Our two countries have overcome  the deplorable rupture brought about by war and have forged a  close and cooperative relationship."    "I sincerely hope that this visit will further contribute to  the promotion of friendship between our two peoples," the  emperor said.    The emperor and empress were greeted with full honors  including a 21-gun salute.    They will attend a state dinner in the Rose Garden of the  White House hosted by President Clinton this evening.    The couple arrived in Atlanta June 10 for the first leg of  their 16-day tour in the United States. They plan to visit 11  U.S. cities.    They will leave Washington Wednesday [15 June] and travel to  the University of Virginia and then on to New York.</p>

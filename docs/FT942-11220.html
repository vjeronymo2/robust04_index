			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Mercantile &amp; General Re swings back into the black Mercantile &amp; General Reinsurance, the reinsurance subsidiary of the Prudential, yesterday returned to the black. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 104m were achieved for 1993, against losses of Pounds 45m last time, despite a Pounds 49m strengthening of reserves against claims from business underwritten in prior years. 'The results have clearly benefited from our policy of profit before volume,' said Mr John Engestrom, group chief executive. M&amp;G Re reduced its exposure to general reinsurance following heavy catastrophe claims in recent years. As a result, general reinsurance premium income fell from Pounds 409m to Pounds 332m, although the fall was less steep than the company envisaged a year ago owing to rate increases in many areas of the international market. The rate rises helped this segment of the business report profits of Pounds 5.6m (Pounds 143.5m losses). In contrast, the group increased its premium from life reinsurance, in which it is an international market leader, to Pounds 765m (Pounds 613m). Life profits amounted to Pounds 73m (Pounds 67m). Expansion in the life area was focused in the North American medical expenses market. Extra reserves were needed to meet claims from past catastrophes and marine reinsurance liabilities incurred on policies underwritten in prior years. An extra Pounds 9m was set aside to meet claims relating to asbestos and pollution. The shareholders' operating result - investment income plus 'smoothed' capital gains - amounted to Pounds 25.6m (Pounds 31.5m).</p>

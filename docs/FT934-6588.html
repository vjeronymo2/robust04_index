			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Quaint little quango: Democracy and British interests go hand in hand - sometimes Last night Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, hosted a reception in honour of the Westminster Foundation for Democracy. This little-known quango has now been up and running for just over a year, headed by Diana Warwick, formerly general secretary of the Association of University Teachers. Ms Warwick is no Tory. By choosing her as the WFD's first chief executive, the board of governors (seven politicians of various parties, seven independent 'experts') showed that, in its effort to spread pluralism overseas, Britain would practise what it preached. At first glance the WFD looks like a belated and rather feeble imitation of the US National Endowment for Democracy, set up by Ronald Reagan as part of his worldwide anticommunist crusade in 1983. Both are supposed to spend taxpayers' money on promoting democracy abroad, and both have structures designed to refute any suspicion that the party in government at home is using them exclusively to back like-minded parties in other countries. The Ned has Dollars 35m (Pounds 23.7m) to spend annually, beside which the WFD's Pounds 2m for 1993-94 looks paltry - though it is double what it was in its first year, and Ms Warwick has asked for a further 50 per cent rise in 1994-95, hoping Mr Hurd's enthusiasm will shelter her against the Treasury's chill wind. But the Ned was nearly blown away this summer, when the House of Representatives deleted its budget from the 1994 foreign aid appropriations bill. (It was restored in October by a House-Senate conference committee.) The Ned had come under attack for corruption and mismanagement, and for running its own foreign policy which does not always coincide with the government's. Its structure seems almost designed to produce that result, since it passes 70 per cent of the money to four subsidiary quangoes, set up by the Republican and Democratic parties, the AFL-CIO trade union movement, and the US Chamber of Commerce. Officials of these bodies, and of the Ned, have been accused of using the money for 'political tourism', luxury travel for themselves and their friends ostensibly for political fact-finding, and of financing activities whose connection with democracy was dubious. Examples from the 1980s in a recent briefing paper from the Cato Institute, a Washington think-tank, include the funding of a military-backed presidential candidate in Panama; of the opposition to former President Oscar Arias of Costa Rica (whose impeccable democratic credentials were marred only by his criticism of US support for the Nicaraguan Contras); and, most bizarrely, of an extreme right-wing group in France, justified by the AFL-CIO on the grounds that France, under Francois Mitterrand, was 'threatened by the communist apparatus'. The WFD, with much less money to throw around and a staff of only four, should have less scope for such abuses. Although 50 per cent of its funding goes to projects recommended by British political parties, each project has to be approved by the full board. It has started work in three priority areas - central and eastern Europe, the former Soviet Union, and English-speaking Africa - where many countries attempting a transition to democracy are 'intrinsically important to Britain' and/or particularly amenable to British leverage. Among projects Ms Warwick is particularly proud of are sponsorship of Sposterihach, a bulletin produced by a small group of Ukrainians 'to inform Ukrainian opinion-formers about international affairs and international perceptions of Ukraine'; and support for independent media in the former Yugoslavia. Both of those come under the 'non-partisan' heading. Of projects proposed by political parties, the Conservatives have so far had the lion's share in central and eastern Europe, while all the South African projects in the first year were proposed by the Labour party, involving various forms of assistance to the ANC. By contrast there were non-partisan projects in Kenya and Malawi, both aimed at helping to nudge reluctant governments towards multiparty democracy. Support for the Malawi Democratic Alliance was perhaps the most daring, since this happened in a country whose government had not yet conceded the principle of multiparty democracy. But it still fitted with the broad thrust of British foreign policy, which is to encourage accountable and transparent government in countries that receive British development aid. The WFD is conspicuous by its absence in east Asia, where western efforts to export democracy have run into harsh criticism from countries, such as Singapore, with which Britain has important business ties. In the Islamic world, the WFD's first-year activities were confined to two projects in Yemen and one in the Palestinian occupied territories. Ms Warwick appeared uncomfortable when I asked her how the board would react to an appeal for help from a group of Saudi Arabian citizens seeking to promote democracy in their country. She referred me to the 'guiding principles' set out in the foundation's first annual report, which declares the need to 'reinforce success' and 'prevent backsliding', and notes 'the relative importance of different countries to British interests'. Saudi Arabia is very important to British interests, but I doubt if Mr Hurd thinks those interests would be served by promoting democracy there. On the other hand there is a fourth guiding principle, rather cryptically phrased: 'the contribution to the 'domino' effect'. Could it be that the foundation sees Yemen as a democratic 'domino' on the Arabian peninsula? It is probably more tactful not to ask.</p>

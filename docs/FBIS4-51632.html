			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 19 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and  Australia met Monday for their quarterly beef talks, but failed  to strike a deal due to disagreements over the volume listed in  the wholesale market and carry-over of excess imports.    Seoul proposed to increase the listed volume of common meat  at the wholesale market to 1,000 tons this year from 1993's 800  tons, but canberra was opposed, calling the amount too small  compared with this year's beef imports of 106,000 tons.    Australia again refused Korea's request to have the volume  exceeding the import quota be carried forward to next year  because it predicted actual imports to be more than the  designated quota in view of current consumption.    The two will take up the issue at the next quarterly  meeting.</p>

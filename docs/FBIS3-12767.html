The external affairs minister, Mr. Dinesh Singh,  told the envoys of the European troika and the U.S. charge d'  affaires in New Delhi today that neither the letter nor the  spirit of the Pakistan resolution is acceptable to New Delhi.  It will also not help in improving the situation in Jammu and  Kashmir as it is the direct result of the Pakistan-sponsored  terrorism. He asked them to convey India's position on the  Pakistan resolution and hoped that the delegations of these  countries will work closely with the Indian delegation in  Geneva. The meeting was held at the request of the envoys.</p>

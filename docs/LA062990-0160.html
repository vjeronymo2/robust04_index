			<p><P> June 29, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MEMORIAL SERVICE WILL BE HELD FOR SCHOOLTEACHER CHRISTOPHER POPEJOY  </P> <P> A memorial service will be held Sunday for the son of well-known residents  William and Nancy Popejoy. Christopher Todd Popejoy, a junior high school  teacher, died Sunday in an off-road vehicle accident on a friend's ranch in the  Sacramento area. He was 27.  </P> <P> Popejoy, who was working toward a master's degree in education at National  University in Sacramento, was driving his four-wheel-drive vehicle when it  overturned, killing him and injuring a passenger. The accident occurred on  private property in Elk Grove, located about 15 miles south of the state  capital, the California Highway Patrol said.  </P> <P> "Chris died doing something he loved," said his 30-year-old brother, Matt  Popejoy. "He had a zest for life that a lot of people have never experienced.  He went full steam ahead, eyes wide open. He squeezed every precious moment out  and probably experienced more in 27 years than most people do in their entire  life."  </P> <P> His parents, 10-year Newport Beach residents, are active supporters of the  Orange County Performing Arts Center, the Adoption Guild of Orange County and  the Balboa Bay Club Racquet Club.  </P> <P> William Popejoy is also a principal of the Irvine-based Robert M. Bass Group,  which last year bought out American Savings Bank in a government-assisted  transaction. He served as chairman and chief executive officer of the bank  before the buyout.  </P> <P> Christopher Popejoy taught history and English at Andrew Carnegie Junior High  School in Fair Oaks, near Sacramento.  </P> <P> He previously worked as a substitute teacher in South Central Los Angeles and  the east San Fernando Valley.  </P> <P> He was a graduate of the University of Southern California and a member of  Delta Sigma Phi fraternity. Raised chiefly in the Beverly Hills area, he  graduated from California Preparatory School in Van Nuys.  </P> <P> In addition to his parents and his brother Matt, he is survived by another  brother, Parry Popejoy, and his godchildren, Christopher Ales and Jessica  Masserman.  </P> <P> Sunday's memorial service will be held at 3 p.m. at Mariners Church, 1000 Bison  Ave., Newport Beach. In lieu of flowers, the family asks that donations in  Christopher Popejoy's name be made to Victory Outreach Church in Los Angeles.  </P></p>

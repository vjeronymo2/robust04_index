			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many in the seafood industry believe that economic abuse is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> one its most significant problems. A survey conducted by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> National Fisheries Institute found that the Institute's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> membership supported mandatory inspection as a means of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> overcoming practices that pose a threat to the reputation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processors and packers adhering to scrupulous practices in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> representation of their products (Ref. 127). General agreement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was found to exist among processors, distributors, and importers,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as well as retailers and restaurateurs, that abusive economic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> practices are widespread, including overglazing and overbreading  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of fishery products, inaccurate net weight measurement, and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substitution of inferior species for more valuable fish.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In a similar industry study by the Southeastern Fisheries  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Association, members ranked problems with economic fraud (such as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> species identification, overglazing, and the use of phosphates)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> above all other seafood industry problems, except vessel handling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> practices (Ref. 128).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Recommended Adoption of HACCP-Based Methods  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although the agency recognizes that HACCP was developed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> primarily to address safety, FDA believes that the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement in &sect;123.6, for seafood processors to adopt HACCP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> methods to ensure the safety of seafoods provides an opportunity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for processors to develop and apply effective control point  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures that they can use to ensure that seafoods comply with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the provisions of sections 402(b) and 403 of the act, The Fair  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Packaging and Labeling Act, the seafood standards of identity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> promulgated in 21 CFR, and applicable compliance policy guides  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issued by the agency (Compliance Policy Guides 7108.01, 7108.03,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7108.04, 7108.12, 7108.13, 7108.14, 7108.21, and 7108.23).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consequently, the agency is proposing in Appendix D to establish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a guideline for HACCP-based procedures to avoid economic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adulteration and misbranding of seafoods. Following this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> guideline will enable processors to develop procedures and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> records that will establish that they are not engaged in any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> practices that would render their products economically  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adulterated. Clearly, however, guidelines cannot prevent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> economic fraud.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The following guideline for product integrity lists critical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control points covering raw material receipt, processing, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> labels and labeling that processors and importers can incorporate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in their HACCP plans. The agency believes that proper control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> begins with verification of the raw materials received by a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processor. Therefore, in Appendix D, section 2.a., the agency is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suggesting that, as part of their HACCP plan, processors and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> importers should include critical control points beginning with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the receipt of raw materials. Ensuring that raw materials meet  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> critical limits (e.g., correct species identification, net  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> weight, additive identification) at the point they enter a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processor's or importer's control is crucial.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are a number of ways to ensure that species are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> properly identified. Physical examination, as indicated in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix D, section 2.a.1. is the typical method of determining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the identity of a species. The agency believes that most seafood  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processors and importers are knowledgeable about the species that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> they handle and would have personnel available at the point of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receipt who could monitor the incoming shipments for species  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substitution. Expert consultation is another option for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> correctly identifying species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Processors or importers can also check the identity of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seafood by employing laboratory services, as provided for in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix D, section 2.a.2. Protein chromatography is a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> laboratory method that can accurately establish the species of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fish and fishery products (Ref. 50). Another option, Appendix D,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 2.a.3., is to receive raw materials certified by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suppliers under either limited or general and continuing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> guaranties (section 303(c)(2) of the act (21 U.S.C. 333(c)(2))  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and 21 CFR 7.12 and 7.13).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In Appendix D, section 2.b., the agency points out that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processors must ensure that the labels, labeling, and invoices of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their finished products accurately list weight, count, size, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> product identity, as well as the content of valuable constituents  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i.e., that ingredient that the consumer identifies as providing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the reason to purchase the product, for example, the shrimp in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> breaded shrimp). The content of the valuable constituents must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be maintained as required by FDA's standards of identity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations (21 CFR part 161, including: oysters, Pacific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> salmon, canned wet packed shrimp in transparent or nontransparent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> containers, frozen raw breaded shrimp, frozen raw lightly breaded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shrimp, and canned tuna) or in accordance with FDA's compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> policy guides.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> More specifically, as in Appendix D, section 2.b.1., the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> species must be correctly identified by its common or usual name  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and be so represented on the label and labeling. To assist  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processors and consumers, FDA has developed both printed and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> database versions of the ``FDA Fish List'' to provide such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> guidance. Also specific requirements for such labeling are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> listed in Standards of Identity and the Common or Usual Name  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations (21 CFR, parts 161 and 102).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix D, sections 2.b.2. through b.5. are based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 402(b) of the act. Under Appendix D, section 2.b.2., the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processor needs to ensure that valuable constituents of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> product are not omitted or abstracted. For example, breaded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shrimp must contain the required weight ratio of shrimp to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> breading. Similarly, shrimp must be of the size and/or weight  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specified on the label or labeling. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

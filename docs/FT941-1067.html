			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Pre-paying fuel VAT You said last week that utility customers will have a 'second chance' before April 1 1995 to avoid paying the full 17.5 per cent VAT rate on household fuel. Could you explain how this works? VAT is applied at the rate prevailing when payment is made. Before April 1 this year, each Pounds 100 paid to a utility buys Pounds 100 of fuel, regardless of when it is actually used. Between April 1 1994 and March 31 1995, it will take Pounds 108 to buy Pounds 100 worth of fuel. From April 1 1995, it will take Pounds 117.50 to buy Pounds 100 of fuel. So, it could be worthwhile to top up your 'stock' of pre-paid fuel at the 8 per cent VAT rate just before that date. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

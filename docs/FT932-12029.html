			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Shell attacks relief plans for PRT SHELL, THE largest oil and gas producer in the North Sea, yesterday condemned proposals for transitional relief to help those companies which are most affected by any changes to petroleum revenue taxes. Shell's strong defence of the proposed PRT changes and its resistance to transitional help has enraged many of the smaller North Sea explorers which are lobbying hard for some assistance. Many oil companies say exploration activity in the North Sea will be halved if the changes are adopted, with the loss of up to 40,000 jobs. In a confidential survey of the industry by the UK Offshore Operators' Association, the trade group, companies said they would cut their drilling programmes by sinking 206 fewer wells between now and 1997 if the PRT changes are adopted. Shell said that drilling levels had been falling anyway because of a lack of attractive drilling prospects and this would continue even without the tax changes. The company which, as a joint venture with Esso, produces about 30 per cent of the UK's oil and 20 per cent of its gas, said the estimates for job losses resulting from the PRT changes were 'broadly overblown'. Shell said a period of transition for the changes would introduce an element of uncertainty into the North Sea tax regime for the first time. Mr John Butterfill, the Conservative MP Bournemouth West, tabled an amendment on Tuesday to the Finance Bill that would extend tax relief to wells the industry had already commited itself to drill as a transitional arrangement. This would be paid for by keeping PRT at 55 per cent until the end of 1996. The original Budget proposals would cut PRT from 75 per cent to 50 per cent and abolish tax relief on exploration and appraisal wells.</p>

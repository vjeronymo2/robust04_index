			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Buoyant BAT says US riots will not hit profits BAT Industries, the tobacco and financial services group, said yesterday the riots in Los Angeles should not affect the profits of its Farmers Group subsidiary, a leading provider of insurance to small businesses in California. The details emerged as BAT announced a 14 per cent increase in pre-tax profit to Pounds 262m in the first quarter of this year, with tobacco making a record Pounds 209m at the trading level. Group turnover advanced from Pounds 3.63bn to Pounds 3.87bn, and earnings per share from 7.9p to 8.7p. BAT was able to provide a snapshot of the riot claims coming in to the three reciprocal insurance exchanges which Farmers manages - obtaining its profit from fees on premiums, rather than from underwriting. By yesterday, about 300 riot-related claims had been received. The total amount was expected to reach at least Dollars 70m (Pounds 39.5m). Estimates of the total damage in all the cities affected have ranged from Dollars 1bn to Dollars 1.5bn, but it is not clear how much was insured. To put the riot claims in perspective, Mr Michael Prideaux, public affairs director, said claims arising from a hailstorm in Texas last week had amounted to Dollars 70m and the total for last year's Oakland fire was Dollars 130m. Bought for about Pounds 3.2bn in late 1988, Farmers increased its trading profit to more than Pounds 100m in the first quarter. Sir Patrick Sheehy, chairman, said that after financing costs there was a Pounds 60m contribution to group profits. Its profit and that of Allied Dunbar, the UK life business, were again eroded by losses at Eagle Star, the composite insurer hit by mortgage and other recession-related provisions. Overall, financial services saw its first-quarter trading profit fall from Pounds 112m to Pounds 95m. Tobacco was again a strong performer, increasing trading profit by 11 per cent to Pounds 209m. Sir Patrick said cigarette export volumes were 18 per cent ahead. Kent and Lucky Strike had maintained their success, while State Express 555 had become the UK's largest export brand. New markets included Hungary, while penetration continued to increase in Japan and Korea. Brazil had returned to profit and had recently ended 27 years of price controls on cigarettes.

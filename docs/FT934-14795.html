			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Insurers rally Composite insurers rallied in the afternoon after strong selling in the early part of the session had caused a sharp retreat. Several market watchers had attributed the early decline to a negative note from Kleinwort Benson, but the securities house denied any such move. Commercial Union finished 12 off at 631p, and General Accident lost 14 to 723p. Royal Insurance shed 7 to 308p, after trade of 5.8m. Oil stocks saw an active day with a variety of triggers sparking trading. With second-line stocks attracting investor interest, one specialist suggested that the sector may be shaping up for a substantial reshuffle. 'Some stocks have gone as far as they are going while others are beginning to attract interest and be regarded as having potential.' He added that many second-line stocks had steadily been moving themselves into strong positions. 'Many have gone through the pain barrier and this is beginning to be recognised. There's a feeling of recovery in the air.' Added to this is the momentum that a more stable oil price has given to the sector. Enterprise Oil moved strongly ahead after announcing an add-on discovery of oil in a North Sea development. Its price gained 6 to 471p in good volume of 1.7m. Rumours moved through the market of a possible asset swap between Enterprise and Monument Oil and Gas with the two looking at an exchange of activities to balance long and short-term activities. Monument ended the day unchanged at 52 (and three quarters) after a slightly erratic performance. Lasmo struggled a little to hold its price and lost 1 1/2 to close at 137 1/2 p. Figures from Darty, the French electrical retailer owned by Kingfisher, impacted badly on the parent company's shares. They closed off 10 at 646p. Stores analysts said that although not as bad as had been expected given the state of the French economy, some investors had used the excuse to take profits after the stock's recent good run. Do It All owners WH Smith and Boots continued to be buoyed along on the hopes that the expected forthcoming rationalisation is as painless as hoped for. Talk in the market suggests that the companies will probably close around 60 sites, but that a fair chunk of these may have already been sold to other retailers. Smith shares added 3 to 465p, Boots steadied at 502p. Among banks, broker Smith New Court gained 8 to 378p, after rival BZW was reported to have upgraded profit expectations. Strong two way business in National Westminster brought volume of 8.2m, as the shares firmed a penny to 555p. Shares in Automated Security, under a cloud since last week's profits warning bounced 16 to 113p, after the company chairman bought 250,000 at 101p. Talk of cuts in infrastructure spending continued to overhang BICC, which is heavily involved in road building activity through its Balfour Beatty subsidiary. The shares lost another 10 to 397p. Nervous trading ahead of next week's figures weakened Smiths Industries where the shares fell 4 to 371p. TI Group, whose shares perked up earlier this week after it announced disposals worth Pounds 40m was said to have suffered from a stock overhang. The poor market trend together with general profit-taking saw engineering group Siebe give up 8 to 524. A gain for Pearson of 2 to 544p came against a generally downbeat media sector. The rise coincided with the launch by SG Warburg of a multi-media warrant comprising a basket of stocks, mostly with European interests. Elsewhere, VAT fears gripped publishing stocks with Daily Mail Trust falling 75p to 944; Mirror Group losing 5 to 163p and News International giving up 2 to 268p. Building materials group MB-Caradon, which yesterday said it is changing its name to Caradon at the end of the month, closed 3 ahead at 339p, after announcing a 94.8 per cent take up of its Pounds 334m rights issue. The outstanding rump had been placed with institutions. An optimistic annual meeting at Ellis and Everard saw the shares bounce 6 to 223p. The company will have an opportunity to sustain investor interest later this week when it hosts lunches with fund managers at a leading London stockbroker. ICI failed to keep a grip on an early lead and its shares ended unchanged at 723p in modest volume. An announcement that it was restructuring interests in South Africa was not considered particularly sensitive to share earnings. A stock overhang, said to involve one broker trying to place a lump of 5m shares, restricted Storehouse, off 7 at 200p. Other statistics, Page 24.</p>

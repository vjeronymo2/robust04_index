			<p><P> December 30, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAILMAN FACES 3 FELONY COUNTS IN DOG'S SHOOTING  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County district attorney's office filed three felony charges  Friday against a Postal Service mail carrier who allegedly shot and killed a  dog in Arleta because the dog had bitten him earlier.  </P> <P> Floyd Bertran Sterling, 34, was charged with carrying a concealed weapon, using  a firearm in a grossly negligent manner and cruelty to animals, with the  special allegation that he used a firearm. He was not immediately arrested,  police said.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, debate over the incident continued to build as residents of  Sterling's postal route rallied to his defense, praising him as an excellent  mail carrier and saying the dog was vicious and its owners had let the animal  run loose.  </P> <P> Tammy Brody, 27, had told police that Sterling "freaked out" and shot her  2-year-old mixed-breed German shepherd, Skippy, just as Brody emerged from the  house Tuesday to give the mail carrier a bottle of vodka as a Christmas  present.  </P> <P> Brody said the dog was not menacing Sterling at the time, but the mailman told  police afterward that the animal had bitten him earlier this year.  </P> <P> Felony charges were brought against Sterling because he was recently convicted  of carrying a loaded firearm in a public place, and because he had also been  convicted of misdemeanor spousal abuse in 1982, Deputy Dist. Atty. Myron  Jenkins said.  </P> <P> If convicted on all counts, Sterling faces a maximum sentence of 5 years and 8  months in state prison, Jenkins said.  </P> <P> No records were available on Sterling's spousal abuse conviction. According to  court documents, he was still on two years' probation after pleading no contest  in San Fernando Municipal Court in December, 1988, to a charge of carrying a  loaded .44 magnum revolver in his car on his way home from a firing range.  </P> <P> Beth Adams, 30, who lives near the Brody house, said she was "shocked" and  "flabbergasted" that Sterling -- who has been placed on leave by the Postal  Service while federal authorities investigate -- may go to prison.  </P> <P> Adams, who also has a German shepherd, called Sterling a "sweet, wonderful  man," a "good Christian" and "gentle as a lamb." Other neighbors also praised  Sterling as a dedicated mail carrier and a kind person, who often took time to  chat with people on his route. Several, including Adams, said they had come to  consider him a good friend.  </P> <P> Skippy, however, was known around the neighborhood as a "vicious dog," Adams  said.  </P> <P> Vera Kuppers, who is in her 60s, blamed the Brodys for Skippy's death, saying  that "people think that just because their dog loves them or is good to them,  it's OK for them to run around at any time. But a dog can turn on a stranger  any time."  </P> <P> Brody's sister, Debbie Roedel, 15, said that family members tried to keep  Skippy at home but the dog had learned to unlatch the door of the house. She  said he frequently ran toward people barking, but "that was his way of  playing."  </P> <P> "Sometimes he would run towards little kids and bark, but his tail was always  wagging," Debbie said.  </P></p>

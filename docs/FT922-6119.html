			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / International Company News: Sumitomo Heavy ahead 5.6% at pre-tax level SUMITOMO Heavy Industries, a leading Japanese shipbuilder and steelmaker, posted a non-consolidated 5.6 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Y4.23bn (Dollars 32.8m) for the year to end-March. Gains in financial items accounted for the rise at the pre-tax level. However, the company suffered its first drop in operating profits in four years as a result of higher costs, with a decline of 14.3 per cent to Y11.8bn related to products sold. The value of Sumitomo Heavy's short-term securities portfolio plunged Y41.9bn to Y93.7bn. Net profits were off 13.6 per cent at Y3.5bn because of an extraordinary loss resulting from suspended printing machine manufacturing and sales activities. The company, which no longer counts shipbuilding as its main activity, has diversified into construction, cargo handling and injection molding. It delivered six mid-sized ships during the period. Machinery sales declined 1.9 per cent to Y81.5bn, while orders were up 4.8 per cent at Y91.9bn. Shipbuilding, steel frame and defence equipment sales were off 1.4 per cent at Y86.8bn, and orders fell 47.1 per cent to Y68bn. Standardised and mass-production machinery turnover fell 2.8 per cent to Y80bn and orders declined 10.3 per cent to Y72bn. Quantum and other equipment sales jumped 87.6 per cent to Y38.8bn and orders by 76.3 per cent to Y48.6bn. This year, Sumitomo Heavy expects sales to rise 4.5 per cent to Y300bn, while pre-tax profits are expected to slip 6 per cent to Y4bn and net profits by 28 per cent to Y2.5bn.</p>

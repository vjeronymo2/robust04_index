			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hindi </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial in two installments: "Is Pakistan Provoking India </F> in Order to Instigate a War?"]  <H5>  [7 Feb p 4] </H5>   [Text] The relationship between India and Pakistan has been  full of tension for some time. India's relations with the United  States are also becoming tense. Not only Indian, but foreign  newspapers have also written a lot about the tension among  India, Pakistan, and the United States of America at  international level. Analyses are being made at international  levels on this situation. Let us first discuss the tension  between India and Pakistan.    The day Benazir Bhutto became Pakistan's prime minister a  second time, she started to spew poison against India over the  Kashmir issue. Recently, in Davos, Switzerland, and after her  return from Geneva after attending the Human Rights Conference,  Benazir Bhutto spoke against India continuously to international  and national correspondents with regard to Kashmir. Benazir, who  is nervous about her "civil war" with her brother and her  mother, has started to emphasize her statements against India in  order to divert the attention of her country and of opposition  parties from her family. Bhutto has also been encouraged by the  United States to speak out against India. Benazir also knows  that U. S. President Clinton is opposed to India. Why is that? I  will go over that later; however, after Pakistan failed in  spreading terrorism in Punjab, all Benazir had left with her to  condemn India all over the world was her "one-point program" on  Kashmir.    The way the Indian government started to pressure various  terrorist groups in the Kashmir Valley; the way these terrorists  had to submit after the Hazratbal incident; and the way  Pakistan's efforts to encourage terrorism at the international  level was exposed have all pushed Pakistan to start efforts to  spread unrest in Kashmir across the actual line of control. On  one side, across the actual line of control, rockets are fired  toward the Indian side. On the other side, bombs are set off in  Jammu and Kashmir, and sensitive areas like TV towers are  burned. We do not know how many times terrorist groups attacked  our security forces in that state during the last month. The  time has come for the ice to melt, and thousands of trained  terrorists are waiting to cross the border into India.    While the terrorist groups are misleading the youths in  Kashmir, Pakistani troops are shooting rockets loaded with time  bombs into Indian territory. Recently, Pakistani-trained  terrorists led an early morning organized attack in Kutwara city  and forced security forces to shoot back in retaliation.  Twenty-one people were killed in this exchange of fire,  including three members of the Jammu-Kashmir police. The Hizb-ul  Mujaheddin and the Jamat-ul Mujaheddin both started to raise a  hue and cry over this and began to propagate that atrocities  were being committed against Kashmiri Muslims. Prime Minister  Benazir Bhutto also agreed with them and began to beat a drum at  the international level that the Indian government was  committing atrocities against the Kashmiri people and violating  their human rights. A few days ago, a bomb went off in a Kathua  movie house, killing two people and wounding 23 others. Pakistan  is not worried about the people who were killed or wounded by  that bomb blast, nor are any of the terrorist groups in the  region. However, when the security forces take any action in  their defense or to protect the people, then it is propagated  that the Indian government is committing atrocities against the  Kashmiri people. The international conspiracies hatched in  Jammu-Kashmir are only aimed at attaining one goal: protecting  the seat of power in Pakistan and keeping the attention of the  Pakistani people focused on Kashmir. This gives Prime Minister  Benazir Bhutto time to issue anti-Indian statements in the  United Nations and the UN Human Rights Commission. She tells  them, "Look at how the Indian government is committing  atrocities against Kashmiri Muslims!"    Can there be another goal for Pakistan? Does Pakistan want  to  start another war with India? Is the Pakistani army inciting  India to start a war? According to Indian military intelligence  sources, we cannot deny the possibility that the Pakistani army  is inciting India into war by shooting rockets across the  India-Pakistan control line. According to intelligence sources,  the Pakistani army, by shooting rockets in that region, is  diverting the Indian armed forces attention from fighting the  terrorists and is trying to divert their attention toward the  Pakistani army. The intelligence sources claim that with the new  wave of terrorism in Jammu-Kashmir, the Indian armed forces and  security forces are busy dealing with terrorist acts. This will  facilitate the entry of thousands of trained terrorists into the  Kashmir Valley. The Pakistani army will take advantage of this  opportunity and will take control of part of Indian territory.  That means the Indian army would have to start a war with  Pakistan to get those areas back. This way, two battle fronts  will open in Kashmir. In this situation, when the Indian army is  not getting cooperation from the Kashmiri people, and Pakistan  is getting sympathy at the international level--including the  United States of America--the United States will be able to  pressure India on this issue, and Pakistan will be showered with  new modern weapons and dollars. Using this pretext, Pakistan  will be able to continue its Islamic bomb program, and during  this period, Benazir Bhutto will be able to strengthen her  position as prime minister. If we analyze Jammu-Kashmir and  Pakistan's present situation closely, then the facts related  above support the hypothesis that an international-level  conspiracy is being implemented against India. Are the Americans  involved with Pakistan in this conspiracy? Is not this a  conspiracy to stop India from emerging as an economic power in  South Asia? The anti-India international powers have perhaps  begun to feel that after India has successfully suppressed  terrorism in Punjab, sooner or later, terrorism in Kashmir will  also end, and Pakistan will be defeated there also. What kind of  attitude does the only superpower in the world, the United  States, have toward India in this whole situation? I will talk  about this in the next installment of this article.  <H5>  [8 Feb p 4] </H5>   [Text] Prime Minister Narasimha Rao and the Indian Foreign  Ministry are now clear on the fact that President Clinton's  policy on India-Pakistan relations and Kashmir and Punjab is  against India. It was noted in the past that whenever there a  Democrat was president in the United States, U.S. government  policy was neither opposed to India nor in support it. American  policy on Kashmir was always neutral. The Republican presidents  have always implemented anti-India and pro-Pakistan policies.  During John F. Kennedy's and Jimmy Carter's administrations, the  United States had neutral policies about India. During the eras  of Nixon, Reagan, and Bush, the United States encouraged  Pakistan to spread an anti-Indian tirade and keep the Kashmir  issue alive. Perhaps this is the first time in the history of  United States-India relations that a Democrat, President  Clinton, has adopted an anti-India attitude on Kashmir, Punjab,  and India-Pakistan relations fronts. Have the attitudes of  Democratic Party leaders changed regarding India, or has India  failed to present its case appropriately to the United States?  Whatever the reason, the United States tried to control India's  economy through the World Bank recently and has given up its  neutral position on the human rights issue of Kashmir and  Punjab. The way the United States is encouraging Prime Minister  Benazir Bhutto to spew poison against India clearly indicates  its changed attitude toward India.    In light of this changed situation, India also started to  speak out against U.S. high-handedness. Prime Minister Narasimha  Rao opposed U.S. economic, political, Kashmir, and Punjab  policies in his speech in Davos, Switzerland. This was perhaps  the first time since the late Mrs. Gandhi that an Indian prime  minister used such words against the United States. The  situation at that time was very different. At that time, India  had the full support of the Soviet Union. At this time, however,  it is surviving at the mercy of the United States, which is  controlling the politics of the entire world. Prime Minister  Narasimha Rao's speech and the hints sent by our Foreign  Ministry to the United States have made it clear that India does  not like U.S. interference in its internal affairs.    The way India has expressed its reaction to the United  States' anti-India policies makes it clear that there is a lot  of tension between Delhi and Washington. Both sides will have to  work very hard over the next few days to ease this tension.  President Clinton is fully responsible for the problem in  U.S.-India relations. The way he issued pro-Pakistan statements  about Kashmir and Punjab against India has disappointed the  Indian government.    This is perhaps the first time that the United States has  failed to appoint an ambassador to its embassy in New Delhi.  This can give us an idea of how important India is to the  president of the United States. It was heard before that former  Senator Stephen Solarz, who is pro-India, could be appointed  ambassador to India. If this happens, there would be efforts to  improve relations between India and the United States. Neither  the U.S. administration nor President Clinton, however, have  made a final decision about this. The situation has deteriorated  so much now that Indian Ambassador Siddhartha Shankar Ray in  Washington and our Foreign Ministry have been forced to believe  that Prime Minister Narasimha Rao's proposed trip to the United  States should be canceled. Mr. Rao had planned to visit the  United States in February. There are still plans for Mr.  Narasimha Rao to meet with Bill Clinton; however, according to  Foreign Ministry sources, if President Clinton is so convinced  against India on the Punjab and Kashmir issues that he is making  open statements at the international level, Mr. Narasimha Rao's  trip to the United States and meeting with Clinton will not  yield any positive results.    As for India, the terrorism in Punjab has almost ended. The  situation there has improved, and Punjab is making economic  progress. A year ago, India's Foreign Ministry complained that  the way terrorism was ended in Punjab under Narasimha Rao's  leadership, and the way the U. S. policies opened the Indian  economic system to the international market will cause the young  U.S. President Clinton to praise India and invite our prime  minister to visit the United States. He is the prime minister of  the world's largest democracy and was visiting other countries.  But the U.S. president did not invite him. Instead of praising  Mr. Rao, Mr. Clinton encouraged propaganda against India.    It is surprising to learn that Clinton, who is the president  of the world's only superpower, still believes there is  terrorism in Punjab and that rights are violated there. The  whole world knows that the situation in Punjab has changed over  the last two years and that peace has been established there.  The controversial letter that Mr. Clinton wrote to Ghulam Nabi  Fai, who is president of the Pro-Pakistan Kashmir Council in the  United States, and the way anti-India propaganda was accelerated  in U.S. policy, forced Mr. Siddhartha Shankar Ray to threaten  that if the U.S. government's attitude remained anti-India, then  the Indian prime minister would cancel his trip to the United  States. Such talk from the Indian ambassador and our foreign  ministry will not have much of an effect on a powerful nation  like the United States; however, by telling this to the United  States at the international level, we have at least demonstrated  our pride in independent policies. This step is praiseworthy.    In my personal opinion, after the United States started its  propaganda against India, it was the first time our Foreign  Ministry responded strongly to it. Before this, all U.S.  decisions were considered as new laws by the whole world. India  is the only country in the world with the courage to tell the  United States, the policeman of the world, that India is fully  alert to human rights and democracy, and that it will not accept  external interference in this area. What will be the result of  India's bluntness? How will it affect Indo-U.S. relations in the  future? Will Pakistan's position become stronger because of the  India-Pakistan tension? It is natural for such questions to  arise; however, at this point, the most important question is of  India's pride and self-respect. If we have to pay a heavy price  to protect our pride and self-respect, we should be fully  prepared to do so.  *</p>

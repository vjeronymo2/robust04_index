			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Krystyna Grzybowska from Brussels: "Against a </F> New Division of Europe"; final three paragraphs attributed to  M.W.]    [Text] On Sunday [9 January] in Brussels, U.S. President  Clinton warned former communist countries against the possible  return of dictatorships and presented them with the prospect of  joining NATO. However, he ruled out the possibility of  broadening the organization immediately. "We cannot replace old  divisions with new ones," said Clinton.    The speech by the President of the United States was the  most  important event on the day before the opening session of the  North Atlantic Council. It was delivered at a meeting with young  people in Brussels City Hall.    In his 30-minute speech, the President emphasized: Europe is  the main partner of the United States, but it is not the only  one. The United States is also linked by partnership to the  Americas and Asia.    Discussing the security of Europe, the President stated that  it must be constructed on the rules of democracy, free market,  and civil society. Military security depends on all of these  factors as well. The President said that Europeans are part of  the Western European Union, the European Union, the CSCE, and  the United Nations. However, NATO is the foundation of security.    "Partnership for Peace," understood as a process or an  evolution, is aimed at broadening NATO and opening the door for  cooperation for all former adversaries, including Russia and  Ukraine. The U.S. President did not exclude the possibility of  NATO intervention if peace were jeopardized in Europe.    The Final Communique Commission has almost finished working  on the text of this document. As we could find out in Brussels,  the most important part of it concerns NATO relations with the  states of Central and East Europe. It is supposed to be declared  that these relations will be broadened, deepened, and  strengthened. As a sign of the final overcoming of former  confrontation, joint maneuvers of NATO and former Warsaw Pact  states are to be held as early as this year. They are supposed  to be a preparatory step before peace missions.    The project defines "Partnership for Peace" as a  transitional  form that would link the Central and East European states to  NATO and that would not threaten Russian reforms. Thanks to  broad military cooperation, these relations are to be raised  from the level of dialogue to the level of political and  military partnership. NATO will want to adjust the Central and  East European armies to the standard of the alliance through  practical cooperation and officers' training. Thus, an important  condition would be met before integration with NATO at a later  date.    The first step is supposed to be joint maneuvers. Moreover,  Central and East European states will be allowed to send liaison  officers to NATO Headquarters.    In the general document, which should be signed by NATO and  its partners soon, East European states are supposed to commit  themselves to respecting the following rules: non-secrecy in  national defense and budget planning; democratic control over  the Armed Forces; allowing the United Nations and CSCE to employ  their military units in peace missions; developing military  cooperation to plan and carry out these missions, as well as  transforming the Armed Forces so that they will be able to act  jointly with NATO forces at the operational level. NATO is  supposed to supply these states with the necessary technical  information. Soon both parties are to select units that will  cooperate closely with each other.    The final document will also include a detailed list of the  measures that are necessary to harmonize activities, including  the standardization of arms and equipment, as well as necessary  for logistics, strategy, and the martial doctrine.    The only thing that was not made clear before the summit is  the matter of financing the future cooperation. The mere  establishment of additional offices and work posts will cost at  least several million ECU.    Aside from that, the NATO summit is to decide whether  quick-reaction multinational forces should be established for  possible use in peace missions. They would be able to include  military units of states that are not NATO members and of states  that are not part of the military structures of the alliance,  that is to say, France and Spain.    "Combined Joint Task Forces" [CJTF] [preceding four words in  English, translated into Polish as] ("Combined Forces") --  consisting of all kinds of weapons, may be employed in all  crises not envisioned in Article 5 of the Washington Treaty. It  is expected that CJTF will also consist of units of neutral  states as well as from Central and East European states. If  these forces were established, in crises NATO would not have to  act as a whole; it would place only some of its military  installations at the disposal of the Europeans.  <H5>  [Box, p 23] </H5>   In their reports from Central Europe, world news agencies  draw attention to the fact that President Lech Walesa threatened  to reject the concept of "Partnership for Peace," if NATO does  not state unequivocally at the summit in Brussels that the  "Partnership for Peace" program is the road leading to Poland's  full membership in NATO.    Agencies report that Lech Walesa is said to have stated that  unless the NATO summit produces a decision on opening this  organization to states such as ours, he will not go to Prague on  12 January to take part in the meeting between U.S. President  Bill Clinton and Visegrad Group leaders. The President's Press  Office did not confirm this information on Sunday when asked by  RZECZPOSPOLITA. The decision whether Lech Walesa will go to  Prague is supposed to be reached on Monday, after the session of  the government and the president. In his interview with French  television on Sunday, Walesa maintained his criticism of the  "Partnership," calling this proposal "blackmail."    Polish Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak said that the  initiative of the U.S. President is "unclear," known only by its  name. His talks with representatives of the U.S. Administration  did not result in any declarations that the "Partnership for  Peace" program will lead to membership in NATO.</p>

			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / International Company News: Firmer prices bolster Anglo American gold A FIRMER gold price, offset by a modest production performance, helped the gold mines managed by the Anglo American group, the world's largest producer, increase available profit by 7.2 per cent to R269.2m (Dollars 80.36m) in the September quarter, from R251.1m a year ago. Mr Clem Sunter, chairman of the gold and uranium division, attributed the lower-than-expected increase to the high base of the June quarter. 'The previous quarter was really outstanding. It was difficult for us to improve on that, but we have done it and that's due to the gold price,' he said. Gold production was lower at every mine in the group compared with the June quarter, and fell overall by 3 per cent to 65,773kg from 67,803kg. This contributed to a rise in unit costs at all mines, with the average across the group 7.2 per cent higher at R28,930 per kg against R26,982 per kg. The average revenue for the quarter rose 8.2 per cent to R39,320 per kg from R36,327 per kg. The group also announced yesterday that its Free State operation, Freegold, would be developing a new R540m shaft. The new shaft, to be known as Freddie's No 4, will produce an estimated 106 tonnes of gold during its 19-year production life-span. It is expected to yield 80,000m tonnes per month, at an estimated recovered grade of 7.24 grams/tonne. The shaft will reach full production in 2002. The best performer in the group was Freegold, where available (after-tax and capital expenditure) profit rose to R121.4m from R102.5m. Vaal Reefs suffered the effects of an underground sit-in during the quarter, and profits fell to R63.8m from R70.7m. At Western Deep Levels, profits rose to R42.5m from R38.1m. At Elandsrand, they increased marginally to R29.4m from R28.7m. Ergo, the dump treatment operation, made a R12.1m profit.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Muhammad 'Abd-al-Wahab al-Sakit, </F> director of the Arab League's Arab Department and member of the  Arab League delegation in Sanaa, by an unidentified  correspondent; place and date not given -- recorded]    [Text] [Correspondent] Is the Arab League delegation's  visit to Sanaa for mediation or to learn about the latest  developments there?    [Al-Sakit] The mission is in implementation of the Arab  League Council's decision of 7 May expressing the Council's  concern about developments in Yemen and its desire for peace and  stability in this Arab state and founder of the Arab League.  Arab League Secretary General Dr.'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid has  received scores of cables and messages from Arab leaders and  popular and nongovernmental organizations demanding that the  Arab League play a role in this regard.    [Correspondent] An Arab League role is required, as you have  mentioned, but have you sensed a response by the Yemeni leaders  accepting the Arab League mediation?    [Al-Sakit] All the Yemeni leaders and people are eager to  see  an end to the bloodshed in the Republic of Yemen and to cling to  legitimacy and to the Yemeni territories' unity and stability.    [Correspondent] The Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] has  appealed  to the Arab League and fraternal Arab countries to intervene to  halt the fighting. This means that the southerners are willing  to stem the bloodshed and end the war. What about the  northerners?    [Al-Sakit] Everyone is demanding a cease-fire. It is in no  one's interest that the bloodshed should continue in Yemen. All  the Yemeni parties are very eager to stop the bloodshed but the  situation requires some contacts, consultation, and [words  indistinct].    [Correspondent] Sanaa has reportedly rejected a YSP proposal  to halt the fighting and control the crisis.    [Al-Sakit] As I said, the sides are eager to initiate the  measures necessary to stem the bloodshed.    [Correspondent] Does this mean that the door to dialogue has  not been closed and that there is still hope that the parties  will resume dialogue and that a political solution to the crisis  will be reached?    [Al-Sakit] We think so. God willing, the situation will end  as the sincere people of the Arab nation desire.    [Correspondent] Will the League delegation head for Aden?    [Al-Sakit] The situation is not clear.</p>

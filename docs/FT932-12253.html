			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Survey of Business Schools (6): Cosmopolitan vigour - A look at IMD's mission in partnership with companies IMD is not as large or well known as France's Insead and the London Business School. But among aficionados of management education the International Institute for Management Development at Lausanne, Switzerland, is increasingly mentioned in the same breath. The school's 'mission' - which comes in three parts - is a useful clue to its character: IMD wants to be as internationally-minded as possible; it aims to teach general management skills to senior executives; it wishes to maintain and strengthen its already close partnership with industry. Its location in a small neutral country, Switzerland - and furthermore, in Switzerland's minority French-speaking region - certainly helps discourage an inward looking culture. IMD's present MBA class, 82-strong, boasts almost 30 different nationalities, and the teaching staff is similarly cosmopolitan. For the visitor, the campus flavour is distinctively European, with more than a dash of North American openness and vigour. That is scarcely surprising. IMEDE - one of the two Swiss business schools which merged to form IMD in 1989 - was itself created in 1957 by Nestle with the support of Harvard Business School. (The other institution in the merger, IMI-Geneva, was founded in 1946 by Alcan Aluminium.) Today IMD is supported by 30 business 'partners', companies which typically fill, together with 'associates'' participants, about 60 per cent of the places on IMD courses. Partners can also benefit from tailored programmes, such as those which concentrate on specific company problems, involving, say, 15 to 20 employees at a time. These have represented a big growth area in recent years, and now account for about 40 per cent of IMD's total income. A separate tier of financial backers comprises 80 business 'associates', whose main contribution is to attend about 10 brainstorming sessions laid on by the school administrators each year. 'The partners are the companies which are really driving us,' explains Paul Adams, director of external relations. 'We have a very close relationship with them.' IMD's target audience is mainly those in middle and senior executive positions seeking general management skills. In the overall business mix the one year MBA course is relatively unimportant: it accounts for a mere 4 per cent of IMD's income. But its significance, in terms of faculty teaching time and the intellectual development of the school, is much greater. IMD's flagship course at present is probably the 10 week Programme for Executive Development (PED). Dr Peter Lorange, the school's Norwegian president-elect says it is intended 'to make people good in a technical sense, to make them more commercial (that is, when it comes to closing a deal), and to improve their internal motivation.' Lorange says that longer general management courses - with an international orientation - are doing well at the moment; shorter ones, he adds, are proving less successful. Though companies are often taking a commendably long view when it comes to training - 'If you go back in history people have cut management education budgets more than they have this time,' says Paul Adams - IMD has not been untouched by recession. Adams points out that business schools are competing hard for executive time, and that key managers cannot always be spared at a time of restructuring. Overall 1992 numbers at IMD were 15 per cent down on 1990, 'though we are finding that where companies haven't hired graduates, they are putting more money into management education.' Adams also emphasises that the MBA course - a highly intensive 11 month programme with an age profile of 26 to 34 - has grown in size, even if the rate of increase of applications has slowed down. There were about 700 hopefuls for the 82 places on offer this year. Potential areas of expansion such as Eastern Europe have been rather disappointing. Lorange says IMD has been working with some multinationals; teaching facilities are being developed. 'It is being done as part of our value creation here, though, rather than sending a team over there. We do go sometimes, but mostly to fact-find - to research.'</p>

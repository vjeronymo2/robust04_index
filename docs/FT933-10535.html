			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / The ERM: EC economies, the opportunities and risks - Portugal 'We shall carry on as if nothing had happened,' was how Mr Miguel Beleza, central bank governor, reacted, writes Peter Wise. He was making clear he thought the government should maintain a stable currency, a tight monetary policy and rein in budget spending to maintain the fight against inflation. Mr Jorge Braga de Macedo, finance minister, agreed, with a laconic 'global economic policy remains the same'. Most economists believe the ERM changes will benefit Portugal in the short term but could bring difficulties in the medium to long term. One leading bank's chief economist saw greater scope to reduce high short-term interest rates. This would stimulate greater corporate investment, helping the economy out of recession more quickly. Escudo devaluation would also help exports. But economists fear inflation will again start to pick up from the fourth quarter, when the target is an annual average of 6-7 per cent. The lifting of the immediate threat of speculative attacks on the currency has eased pressure to maintain the escudo's parity, and independent economists expect the government to ease their tight rein on budget spending, in spite of Mr Beleza's warning. The budget deficit is close to 6 per cent this year, against a 4 per cent target. Few believe the 3 per cent objective for 1994 is attainable. 'There seems to be a yearning in industry for a return to Portugal's old 'crawling peg' system of devaluation,' said one foreign consultant. 'It seems likely the government will use the 15 per cent scope it has to let the escudo slide down at least to a certain level.' The parity most economists see Portugal aiming to maintain is with the Spanish peseta.</p>

			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / International Company News: Cyprus Amax sees larger savings Cyprus Amax Minerals has realised half the Dollars 120m annual savings predicted when Cyprus and Amax merged in November to form the second-largest US copper producer and the second-largest coal company. 'We are optimistic that the overall savings from putting the companies together will create greater economies than anticipated,' says Mr Milt Ward, chairman, in his statement with the fourth-quarter results. These show that in the quarter Cyprus Amax had earnings of Dollars 17.2m or 21 cents a share on revenues of Dollars 541.7m before a merger charge of Dollars 24.9m. In the 1992 fourth-quarter, the group reported net income of Dollars 18.5m or 40 cents on revenues of Dollars 407.7m, before reorganisation charges of Dollars 4.3m. Including the special charges, the loss was Dollars 7.7m or 14 cents, compared with earnings of Dollars 14.2m or 31 cents. Mr Milt Ward, chairman, said the results were affected by lower copper prices, partly offset by higher copper sales, lower copper costs and Dollars 6m after-tax insurance proceeds related to flooding in Arizona. Cyprus Amax reported 1993 earnings of Dollars 100.2m or Dollars 1.85 a share on revenue of Dollars 1.764bn, compared with a 1992 loss of Dollars 333.6m or Dollars 8.46 a share on revenue of Dollars 1.64bn.</p>

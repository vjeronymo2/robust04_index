			<p><P> June 17, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> DEL MAR FAIR THEME MAY SHED SOME LIGHT ON AN AGE-OLD FOWL QUESTION  </P> <P> The roosters heard crowing Friday at the main entrance to the Del Mar Fair were  more than appropriate for Opening Day. After all, the theme of the fair is a  tribute to the poultry and egg industry -- "Get crackin' . . . It's all for  you!"  </P> <P> But not even these perky poultry products could shed light on the day's most  puzzling question: What came first, the chicken or the egg?  </P> <P> Certainly, the fair seemed like the right place to go for an answer. Once  through the entrance and past the stroller rentals to the right, a wall of  "Eggformation" -- facts about the San Diego County poultry industry -- offered  some hope.  </P> <P> A close look revealed such statistics as the number of hens in the county (4.7  million) and the amount of eggs each one lays a year (274). But nowhere was  there a clue about which came first.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Officials Hesitant  </P> <P> Even fair officials were hesitant to hazard a guess. A "cosmic clue," though,  might be in the setup of the poultry exhibits, a fair spokesman said. The first  exhibit encountered is a hatchery. Chicks can be seen hatching from eggs kept  under a heat lamp. Other livestock exhibits offer a look at everything from  fancy pigeons to llamas to miniature horses.  </P> <P> The fair, which runs through July 4, also features a "Fun Zone" of two roller  coasters, a water ride and a giant Ferris wheel; a garden and flower show;  nearly 600 product concessions; and seven stages for music, dancing and  contests.  </P> <P> For those who favor the livestock exhibits, a short distance from the poultry  hatchery, older chicks peck here and there at the probing fingers of children.  The smell in the barn exhibits might have daunted a few, but sounds and  behavior of the animals amused most.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Blow-Dried Sheep  </P> <P> Outside the sheep exhibits, a few sheep were being blow-dried. The sheep had  been showered and their hair was being fluffed up in preparation for shearing.  One of them apparently looked cute enough to kiss, which a woman did on the  nose.  </P> <P> In another barn, "Samantha," a female limousin beef cow, wasn't as  accommodating. "Just when people say how nice she looks, she starts acting up,"  said handler Melissa Veik. The cow was aggressively trying to get loose from  her tether on a post in the barn.  </P> <P> Eric Denman, 7, prefers to brave some of the fair's scariest rides. Enticed by  the exhortations of a disc jockey at the "Orbiter" -- a whirring ride  accompanied by blaring music -- he eagerly stepped forward.  </P> <P> "It's chicken time," the disc jockey challenged.  </P> <P> Eric's cousin Alexandra, 7, wasn't about to accept. Alexandra wanted to head  over to the water slide.  </P> <P> "She's a scaredy-cat," said her mother, Sarah. "She's a cautious kid. Her  father says it's a sign of intelligence."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Eric Was Turned Loose  </P> <P> After a few minutes of spinning around and around in a small cubicle at a  frightening speed, Eric was turned loose, sort of. He climbed out of the  compartment "a little dizzy" and forgot where the ride's exit was. So, he left  the way he came in -- the entrance.  </P> <P> "It was great," he said, ready to try another ride.  </P> <P> Danielle Thompson, 3, and her brother, Jason, 6, had feather designs painted on  their faces while waiting for business at the rides to pick up a bit.  </P> <P> "Don't say anything to grandma and grandpa when you see them and see what they  say," said their mother, Sheryl. She has visited the fair the past 14 years and  said she would bring her children again later in the fair's run when the kids'  competitions are held.  </P> <P> The squeals of delight from Michael Provder, 6, were directed toward "Eggbert,"  a walking California Fresh Egg. Michael tugged at his grandfather's arm to go  and meet the egg. "Eggbert" was dressed, of course, in California attire --  brightly colored surfer shorts, visor and sunglasses.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Perfect Source to Answer Question  </P> <P> Here, at last, seemed the perfect source to answer the eternal poultry  question: The chicken or the egg?  </P> <P> Via an interpreter, his answer: "The egg, of course."  </P> <P> The fair is open from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. The exhibits are open from 10 a.m. to  10 p.m. Sunday through Thursday, and from 10 a.m. to 11 p.m. on Fridays and  Saturdays.  </P> <P> </P> <P> TODAY AT THE FAIR  </P> <P> 9 a.m. -- Poultry judging (PP&amp;R Barn)  </P> <P> Noon -- Sculpture by L.

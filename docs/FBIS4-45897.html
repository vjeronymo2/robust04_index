			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by David Brown, agriculture correspondent: "Germany </F> Attacked Over Diseased Sheep Imports"]    [Text] Britain will demand tighter animal health and  welfare controls by Germany after the arrival of batches of  diseased and aged sheep destined for ritual slaughter by Muslims.    Some of the animals, from Poland, were declared unfit for  human consumption after they were killed at an abattoir in  Birmingham. They had all been allowed through German border  checks.    Ministers, MPs, vets and animal welfare groups are angry  about the shipments at a time when the German Health Ministry  wants the EC to impose fresh curbs on British beef due to fears  over mad cow disease. Mr Robin Corbett, Labour MP for  Birmingham, Erdington, will table questions about the diseased  sheep in the Commons tomorrow.    The EC council of health ministers will meet in Brussels on  March 30 to consider German demands for new EC restrictions on  British beef despite scientific opinion that it is safe to eat.    Mrs Gillian Shephard, the Minister of Agriculture, has told  Mr Rene Steichen, the EC Farm Commissioner, that the German move  could cause enormous harm to all beef producers in the EC if it  destroyed consumers' confidence in beef. She has already  indicated that Britain may claim compensation from Germany if it  imposes a unilateral ban on British beef.    Mr Keith Meldrum, the Government's chief veterinary officer,  said yesterday: "I don't want to get into a tit-for-tat row. But  some of the imported sheep were in such a poor way when they  arrived at Dover that they should not have been allowed to start  the journey from Poland.    "Obviously we will be urging Germany and other EC countries  to look again at their checking procedures to prevent further  incidents of this kind." Mr Meldrum said that in one case a ewe  gave birth when it arrived at the abattoir. But both it and the  lamb were in such poor condition that they were slaughtered  anyway.    It is an offence under EC and British law to transport  pregnant ewes for slaughter for food.    British anger centers on four lorryloads, each of about 300  sheep, sent to Birmingham between Feb 17 and last week. Three  came from Poland and one from Spain.    Sheep in both the Polish and Spanish consignments were found  to be diseased. Some of the Polish sheep, ageing ewes of between  four and five years old, were found to be suffering from Caseous  Lymphadenitis.    This highly unpleasant disease results in internal  abscesses,  which could cause heavy losses among British flocks. The meat  from these animals was condemned.    The sheep were part of a growing trade in old ewes, shipped  to Britain to provide cut price mutton for ethnic minorities. It  sells for about a quarter of the price of meat from British  sheep.    The sheep are killed with a knife without pre-stunning under  an exemption enjoyed by Muslims and Jews.</p>

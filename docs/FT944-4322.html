			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / Clarke bridges Pounds 1bn gap with extra tax package: Further duties on petrol, tobacco and alcohol after government's VAT defeat Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, yesterday turned to smokers, motorists and drinkers to plug the gap in the government finances caused by this week's Commons defeat over value added tax on domestic fuel. Addressing a packed House of Commons, a boisterous chancellor announced a 1p per litre increase in petrol and diesel taxes and increases of about 4 per cent in tobacco and alcohol duties from January 1 to make up for Pounds 1bn of revenue lost next year. He said the government would trim the social security compensation package that was to protect pensioners and others on income related benefits from the aborted plan to increase VAT on fuel to 17.5 per cent. Mr Clarke also signalled further cuts of Pounds 300m a year in public spending from 1996-97 onwards to make up further revenue shortfalls. Mr Clarke told the Commons that holding the rate of VAT on domestic fuel at 8 per cent would reduce revenue by about Pounds 1bn in 1995-96 and Pounds 1.5bn in subsequent years. He ostentatiously rejected cutting spending plans for the coming financial year or levying more direct taxes on individuals or imposing new taxes on businesses. In a mini-Budget reminiscent of austerity Budgets in the 1950s, he chose to raise Pounds 780m from higher excise duties on fuel, tobacco and alcohol. The social security measures would save Pounds 190m in 1995-96 and more in following years. A reduction in pension rates meant that national insurance contributions would start on earnings of Pounds 58 a week, rather than Pounds 59, from next April, raising receipts by Pounds 50m. Mr Clarke's pugnacious performance in the Commons drew loud applause from Tory MPs and raised hopes among ministers that the wounds in the Conservative party inflicted by the VAT defeat would now begin to heal. But the chancellor's colleagues were under no illusions that the increases in duties will be popular. With many Conservatives already under pressure from the brewing and off-licence industries regarding cheaper wine and beer imports from France, the rise in alcohol duties attracted criticism from several Tory MPs. The package was given a rude reception by the Brewers' and Licensed Retailers' Association: 'It is economic lunacy, French brewers and retailers will be laughing their way to the bank.' There was disquiet on the right of the Tory party that Mr Clarke had confined cuts in public spending to the second and third years of the expenditure programme. Some cabinet members were said to have made clear that they would have preferred deeper cuts in spending totals. But the chancellor was dismissive of criticism of his performance during the past two weeks from the right of his party. He told journalists at a press conference: 'I don't think the entire right is out to get me. One or two I wouldn't be surprised. I feel the same about them.' He accused some of the Eurosceptics of spreading 'malicious fiction'. The chancellor admitted yesterday's plans were very much 'second choice measures' involving 'serious snags' that he would have liked to have avoided. The increased road fuel duties would affect the rural motorist. The decision to increase drink duties rather than to freeze them would affect distillers, brewers and the licensed trade. He said he did not like putting up tobacco duties because of large-scale smuggling, and for this reason left the tax on hand-rolling tobacco unchanged. But he insisted that the government was 'committed to taking all the necessary measures to put the public finances on a sound footing' to keep Britain's 'healthy recovery on track'. Mr Clarke's new plans will put 1p on a pint of beer, 5p on a standard bottle of wine and 26p on a bottle of sprits. They will add 6p to a packet of 20 cigarettes. Trimming the social security compensation would mean a single state pension in the next financial year would be 30p a week lower than announced last week and that for couples 35p lower. Industry groups, such as the Confederation of British Industry and British Chambers of Commerce, critical of Wednesday's interest rate rise, were relieved that business had escaped punishment. Financial markets were unmoved by the chancellor's package. With Labour claiming that the latest measures add a further Pounds 29 a year to the tax bills of the average family, ministers are expecting a crushing defeat in next week's Dudley by-election. Mr Gordon Brown, Labour party shadow chancellor, said the net cut in the average family's income as a result of all Budgets since the general election would reach Pounds 800 a year by next April.

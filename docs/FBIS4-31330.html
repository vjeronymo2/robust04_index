			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, June 3 (MTI) -- The chairman of the  Democratic Union of Vojvodina Hungarians (VMDK) in Serbia,  Andras Agoston, recently accused the Hungarian Government -- in  press statements carried in Hungary -- of having tried to split  the VMDK.    Ministry officials said the Foreign Ministry has always  accepted the VMDK as the legitimate representative of Hungarians  in Vojvodina. In this spirit leaders of the Foreign Ministry  held talks with the VMDK delegations in Hungary, and in the  course of official and unofficial visits to Yugoslavia. The  Foreign Ministry and the Hungarian diplomatic corps has done  much to make the problems of Vojvodina Hungarians known in the  world, mainly in the international organisations trying to  settle the South Slav crisis.    Hungarian foreign affairs leaders, including Foreign  Minister  Geza Jeszenszky, State Secretaries Andras Kelemen and Janos  Martonyi, firmly supported the VMDK during their visits to  Yugoslavia in the past years, agreeing to appear at events  organised by the VMDK, and backing the VMDK publicly.    Hungarian foreign affairs leaders continually pressed for  the  VMDK to be accepted as a political negotiating side by Yugoslav  partners, and for negotiating the issues they raised.    The Hungarian Foreign Ministry has also provided concrete  financial support to the activity of the Vox Humana Humanitarian  Service, set up with encouragement from the VMDK. Alongside the  VMDK, Hungary helped ease the winter hardship for Vojvodina  Hungarians, Foreign Ministry officials told MTI.</p>

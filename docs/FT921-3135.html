			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Election 92: Waiting for a big event The City can call off its panic this morning. There is no certainty that Labour will win the election. That was last week's fashionable whisper; this week's is that the contest could be won by anybody, or nobody at all. Right now, my money is on nobody. If any single party is to win, something will have to happen. If nothing does - if there is no big event, or no overwhelming argument in favour of voting one way or another - the result on April 9th will reflect the national division of opinion indicated by the polls since well before Christmas: stalemate. The Conservatives tried to produce a big event/overwhelming argument with last week's Budget. So far it has had no effect on the balance of support for the parties. This could be because its up-front tax-cutting bribe is hardly worth a couple of pints of beer a week to the average voter. There may, however, be a delayed effect. The underlying message of Mr John Major's Budget was defined by the prime minister in a competently-delivered speech in Torquay on Saturday: 'We want low tax and personal choice,' said he; 'they' - meaning Labour and the Liberal Democrats - 'want high tax and state choice.' We and they will not be able to take the measure of a cumulative repetition of this message for at least another week. The opinion poll results published yesterday reflect polls taken three, four or five days previously. Our FT 'what the polls indicate' chart, presented below this column, shows the weighted average of the six polls with the most recent field dates. It is recalculated every time there is a new poll. On this basis, Labour was about 1 1/4 percentage points ahead of the Conservatives on Friday - half a point down on its pre-budget lead. (Since telephone polls are excluded, the indicated Labour position takes no account of the 2 1/2 -point Conservative advantage suggested by Gallup in yesterday's Sunday Telegraph.) In short, the campaign really does matter. Take the well-remembered events of the final week of the June 1970 election, for which the then Mr Harold Wilson's Big Argument was that the balance of payments had been put right by his government. Now that Britain was strong, it was time to make Britain great, he proclaimed. At first it seemed to work. On the Sunday before the voting the Labour government was about 7 points ahead; one poll gave it something like a 13-point lead. On that same day Britain fell out of the World Cup. Next morning there was a slight break in what had been excellent early summer weather. Then the balance of payments figures appeared, showing (erroneously, it later emerged) a sudden sharp move into the red. By the Thursday what had been a 2 1/2 -point Labour lead at the start of the campaign had been converted into a 2 1/2 -point lead for the Conservatives, whose campaign message was not unlike that of Mr John Major today. To everyone's surprise Mr Edward Heath became prime minister. He asked the previously unheard-of Mrs Margaret Thatcher to be his education secretary. In the February 1974 election the big deciding event may have been the production of an official report saying that the miners, whose strike had caused Mr Heath to call the poll on the wrong day, were in fact underpaid. This was allowed to run on news bulletins for a whole night before the government refuted it. The Conservatives, who had started 5 1/2 points ahead ended up marginally in front of Labour in terms of votes, but fatally behind in seats won. So far, most of the potential deciding events of this campaign have been predictable, which rather spoils their effect. Today's example is expected to be the alternative budget prepared by the Labour shadow chancellor, Mr John Smith. Its purpose is to vanquish Mr Major's argument. Labour, it will say, doesn't really want high taxes, except for high earners, and what the Conservatives call state choice Mr Smith will call investment. If the advance notices are right, it hardly sounds like a decider to me. I can think of two other possibles. One is the movement in the Liberal Democrat vote. Many disgruntled Tories seem to be hiding there. They may come back to the government if their transfer of allegiance is seen to be likely to put Labour in. The other is our FT-Mori poll of executives, whose results are published today. This shows how big business totally mistrusts Labour. At a time of economic uncertainty, even Britain's soft electorate, which is distinctly iffy about business, may be swayed by this.</p>

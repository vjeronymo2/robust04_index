			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / Briefcase Q&amp;A: Seller must pay A GROUP of relations and friends each applied for shares in a privatisation issue using money supplied by only one member. What is the capital gains tax position for members of the group when the shares are sold as a single block and the proceeds retained by the selling member? On the facts outlined, it looks as though the entire CGT liability would fall upon the person who provided the money (with only his or her exempt amount deducted from the total chargeable gain). No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in thses columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

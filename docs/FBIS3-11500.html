The poll reveals that between Fujimori and Javier Perez de  Cuellar, 35 percent prefer Fujimori and 30 percent Perez de  Cuellar.    The survey also reveals something new: If Fujimori competed  against an unidentified candidate of the opposition, the latter  would obtain 36 percent of the votes and Fujimori 39 percent.    Even like this, Fujimori would still be 11 points below the  figure required to, hypothetically, win the first round of  elections and thus eliminate a second round.    The results of the poll, which included a universe of 400  people of different social levels in Lima and Callao between 26  February and 1 March, were disclosed yesterday during the  television program "Contrapunto."</p>

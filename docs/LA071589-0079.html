			<p><P> July 15, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 'NEW KIDS ON THE BLOCK'  </P> <P> To all you complaining groupies who whined about Chris Willman's insightful and  perceptive article about the New Kids on the Block, congratulations. You have  now proved that this group is truly a joke. If you think that thoughtless  lyrics whined by a group of pubescent teens (who can't seem to find a real  image) is music, well, wake up.  </P> <P> Although I found your letters shallow and lacking insight, I do agree with you  on one point: The group does not sound black. To say that it did would be a  horrible insult to great musicians of the past and present such as the Four  Tops, Chuck Berry and, more recently, Living Colour.  </P> <P> Screaming groupies ought to stop drooling over Donnie's cute little "itsy-bitsy  ponytail" and open their ears. I am certain they'd find that the music is not  only unskillfully made but also quite annoying.  </P> <P> JASON GREENSPAN  </P> <P> ERIC GREENSPAN  </P> <P> Fullerton  </P></p>

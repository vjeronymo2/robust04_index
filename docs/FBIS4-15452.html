			<p>BFN     [Text] Vilnius, Apr 07, BNS - The Lithuanian freighter  Elatma sank in the North sea under "very suspicious  circumstances," the ship's captain told Kestutis Miniotas,  president of the Vortika company that owned the ship, the  Vilnius-based LIETUVOS AIDAS newspaper said.    As previously reported, Elatma sank early Monday [4 April]  some 80 kilometers off the Dutch coast. All 11 crew were  rescued by a Belgian navy helicopter. The freighter was  transporting more than 1,300 tons of ammonium nitrate to France.    Miniotas quoted the ship's captain as saying that Elatma  couldn't have started to take on water because of weather  conditions or through technical reasons. The captain said the  ship's hull looked as if an explosion took place inside it.    Miniotas said the ship's hull was in good shape and was  supposed to keep the freighter on float even if water penetrated  one of its sections. Elatma also had very modern navigation  equipment, he said.    The company set up a special commission to investigate the  accident and to assess the damage.    Elatma, 103 meters long and 12.2 meters wide, now lies  around  30 meters deep in a zone where international navigation is very  intensive. The ship may have to be raised together with the  freight.</p>

			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Survey of US Communications (2): Where content will be king  -Creative media In the world of inter-active, multi-media entertainment, content will be king. That, at least, is the current conventional wisdom, which argues that in an age when households will have access to a vast array of information on demand, some of the most profitable businesses will be those creating popular, original entertainment and information services. In other words, the hardware binding together the information superhighway will be nothing without the software which encourages consumers to take a trip on the highway. Certainly, the coming of the multi-media age presents big opportunities and huge challenges for the creative industries of film and television production, publishing, video games, and advertising. The important role film and television programmes are expected to play in the new era has been underlined by the recent Dollars 10bn takeover battle for Paramount Communications, owner of the Hollywood studio Paramount Pictures. The battle was won by cable television company Viacom, creator of the MTV pop video music channel, which defeated QVC, the television shopping network headed by Mr Barry Diller, a leading Hollywood executive who wanted to use Paramount to build a multi-media empire. Paramount was sold for more than most Wall Street analysts thought it was worth because both bidders were gambling that the price of scarce Hollywood assets will rise in a multi-media age as the demand for good film and television content outstrips supply. At the same time, the increasingly global nature of the entertainment industry - with satellites beaming shows to homes across Europe and Asia - offers new profit opportunities to film producers. According to Veronis, Suhler, a New York investment bank, Hollywood's international sales will make up just over 50 per cent of the total by 1997, compared to 38 per cent in 1987. But while the film and television industry's multi-media future looks reasonably bright, there are large question marks. First, some analysts suggest that the inter-active era may simply shift consumption patterns - for example, from renting videos to pay-per-view TV films - rather than increase the number of hours people spend watching movies and films. Second, the creation of the information superhighway could remove some of the power of the large Hollywood studios. In a world of potentially limitless television channels, low budget programmers, making use of cheap digital production and editing tools, could take precise aim at market niches, fragmenting the general TV audience. A forerunner of this move from broadcasting to 'narrow-casting' already exists today in the US. Cable television, which has mushroomed over the past decade and a half, and now reaches 60 per cent of American homes, offers viewers several dozen channels, including niche networks devoted to country music and sports. Cable has cut the audience for conventional, broadcast television channels - NBC, ABC and CBS, together with the more recent Fox system - from around 90 per cent of viewership at the start of the 1970s to a little over 60 per cent now. The conventional broadcast networks are likely to suffer a further erosion of their audience as fibre-optics allow many more narrowcast channels to be pumped into the home, and as programmes are stored on servers which allow the viewer to summon up programmes when they want them, rather than being bound to a broadcaster's 'prime-time' schedule. But while the future may be tough for the networks, they seem unlikely to disappear altogether. Mr Michael Eisner, chairman of Walt Disney, argues that 'networks will continue to be an integral part of television because consumers want quality, structure, familiarity . . . many consumers will still want the networks to make their viewing choices for them.' Despite industry talk of a 500-channel future, Mr Eisner argues that there will be only 10 or so 'great channels' (whether their origins are in cable or broadcasting) which earn nationwide or local recognition and affection. However, the economics of the networks may have to change dramatically, since most of them rely for their profitability on advertising revenues. But in an inter-active world viewers may be even less prepared than now to sit through repeated showings of advertisements, breaking up their TV shows. Advertisers, for their part, are already shifting their campaigns from broadcasting to narrowcasting, focusing much more precisely on the target audience they want to reach. For example, a newly-launched cable television channel, ESPN2, which covers sports popular among the young, such as snow-boarding, allows advertisers to target sporty young males. But the multi-media age will also mean huge changes for the advertising industry. Some of the largest consumer advertisers say the growth of narrowcasting means an end to the conventional strategy of running a few mass-market, big budget commercials a year. They now need to create many, cheaper advertisements in different styles and moods for different audiences. Many new advertising opportunities are also opening up. There is expected to be strong growth in 'infomercials' - programmes which a viewer can summon up to get information about a product. As interactivity develops, these could allow a potential car buyer to interrogate his TV screen about options on a vehicle and even book a test drive, with a salesman delivering the car to his home. At this point advertising blends into television home shopping, an industry which is still in its infancy. At present, home shopping viewers have to pick up a telephone to order an item they want, rather than simply pressing a combination of buttons on a television remote control. They are also bound to the shopping channels' programming schedules, rather than being free to browse through televised catalogues when they want. But as inter-activity develops, television home shopping could displace much of the conventional printed catalogue shopping industry and some conventional retailing. Traditional advertising agencies could lose out if they do not react quickly enough to this rapidly changing world. For example, new rivals, some drawn from the world of television programming, are already experimenting with inter-active advertisements. But whatever the delivery method, the multi-media era will certainly not mean the end of the advertising industry; merely its rebirth in a new and potentially even more potent form, targeted closely at the individual viewer. As Mr Michael Schrage, an authority on the future of US media, points out: 'There will be billboards along the information superhighway.'</p>

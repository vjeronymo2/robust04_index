			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / Shoppers pick up 'green' habits BRITISH shoppers are increasingly environmentally aware, are buying more healthy products, and are becoming accustomed to shopping on Sundays, says a survey published yesterday by Nielsen, the marketing information group. The British Shopper 1993, Nielsen's second annual survey of purchasing habits, found that more than half the UK's consumers have stopped buying aerosols, three-quarters try to purchase recycled paper products when possible, and one in two take used bottles to bottle banks. Women and young people were generally more environmentally aware than men and the older generation, and those in the ABC1 socio-economic group were 'greener' than those in the C2DE groups. UK consumers were buying more healthy products. Sales of low-fat and low-calorie pre-packed salads have grown more than twice as fast as the rest of the pre-packed salad market in the past year, accounting for almost 20 per cent of the market. Nielsen said 15 per cent of coffee sales were for decaffeinated, and low-calorie drinks took more than 30 per cent of the fizzy-drinks market. Low-fat products took more than half the butter and margarine market. The study found 3 per cent of households now shop on a Sunday, compared with only 1 per cent last year. This suggests that Sunday shopping is becoming more widely accepted in England and Wales, even though legal restrictions still apply. One household in eight shops on Sunday at least once a month. Shoppers also tend to spend more on Sundays than on other days of the week, with one in six Sunday shopping baskets valued at more than Pounds 60, compared with one in 10 on weekdays. The survey provided further evidence of two important trends in retailing. Firstly, price is of increasing importance to consumers. UK shoppers were more likely to be influenced by price reductions than any other kind of promotion. Consumers in the Midlands and southern England were most likely to purchase goods on special offer. It also confirmed that almost a quarter of all grocery sales were accounted for by retailers' own-label products. The percentage was highest in chilled foods, at 31 per cent, and lowest in pet foods, where loyalty to manufacturers' branded products was still high. The British Shopper 1993.

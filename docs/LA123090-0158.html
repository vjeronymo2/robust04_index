			<p><P> December 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MIKE DOWNEY: A BASKETBALL HISTORIAN MAKES USC HISTORY  </P> <P> Harold Miner watches the little guy in the black-and-white movie, weaving in  and out, in and out, dribbling and driving, dribbling and driving.  </P> <P> "Bob Cousy always kept his teammates happy. That was his specialty. And he was  never satisfied. Cousy always tried to elevate his game to another level. I try  to incorporate that into my own style of play."  </P> <P> And now Miner watches a taller guy in another old movie, working over a  defender, making his move, making his shot, making his man look bad.  </P> <P> "Oscar Robertson, now he was a consummate basketball player. Watch him back the  guy guarding him toward the basket, use his body and his strength to his  complete advantage. I'm built more like Oscar. I'd like to be more like him."  </P> <P> Miner pops still another cassette into his VCR. He watches poetry in motion. He  watches an artist at work. He watches Julius Erving.  </P> <P> "Now with Doctor J, it was more like ballet. It was grace and style. He turned  basketball into an art form. Everything Julius Erving did on that court was a  thing of beauty."  </P> <P> And finally the films are in living color and current and hi-fi'd and Dolby'd.  And the star of the show is a guy from Chicago, a guy with his tongue hanging  out, a guy who makes other guys' jaws drop. And this guy looks amazingly like  Harold Miner, only older.  </P> <P> "Michael Jordan? Well, the only word that I can think of to describe Michael is  greatness. You know, people try to compare me to Michael, and I just laugh and  laugh at that. I'm no Michael, no way, no how. God, well, He doesn't make too  many Michaels."  </P> <P> Harold Miner, 19, already has become something of a basketball historian. He is  a student of the game, this USC sophomore who has developed into one of the  nation's top scorers. He raids the video stores and book shops, checking out  every videotape or volume that has anything to do with basketball, past or  present, from Naismith to Dean Smith.  </P> <P> In this respect, Miner is much like Mike Tyson, who even in his teens had  committed to memory details and facts from the fights of Jack Dempsey, Gene  Tunney, Joe Louis, Rocky Marciano, Muhammad Ali and others before and after.  Miner studies basketball players like homework, oldies and newies. He's  different from other guys his age who wouldn't know Bob Cousy from Bing Crosby.  </P> <P> Has it paid off? Well, it hasn't hurt. Miner almost certainly will break John  Block's quarter-century old USC record for points in a season. Already this  season, the 6-foot-5 guard has lit up Notre Dame for 35 points and nine  rebounds, made Digger Phelps regret not landing him as a recruit and moved Dick  Vitale to refer to Miner as "the best thing to happen to USC since football."  </P> <P> He keeps playing the way he's playing, some day they'll make movies about him.  </P> <P> With George Raveling's Trojans only now venturing into the taller weeds of  their schedule, beginning Wednesday night at UCLA, Miner has become the  Pac-10's player to watch, the conference's leading returning scorer from last  season. He is building a Miner cult following. A fan club. Harold examiners?  </P> <P> His nickname is Baby Jordan. Like Michael, he shaves his head, rubs his fingers  together like a dice shooter, floats to the hoop with his tongue in a droop. He  says he sometimes has dreams at night in which he leaps for a dunk from the  free-throw line and jams the ball through the basket backward.  </P> <P> Miner is so infatuated with Michael that he thought about enrolling at North  Carolina, just for a shared experience. Even his number is 23. Harold  identifies with him so, he probably pours Diet Coke over his Wheaties.  </P> <P> Also like Jordan, however, Miner would sacrifice some of his personal success  if only USC could establish itself as more of a force in college basketball,  after having losing records over five consecutive seasons. The Trojans were  49-95 during that span.  </P> <P> He could lead them out of the hoop wilderness.  </P> <P> "I think Miner is one of the best players in the country," Phelps said after  Notre Dame's 105-95 loss to USC at South Bend, Ind. "We really wanted him here,  and you can see why. He's going to be one of the greatest scorers the game has  seen."  </P> <P> Funny thing about Miner picking USC: One of the main reasons he did so was to  play closer to his family in Inglewood. Then his father, Melvin Miner, a  computer programmer for IBM, was transferred to Colorado. So, when Harold  scored 24 points in USC's 74-67 victory on Dec. 8 at Colorado State, it was the  first chance his father had to see him play in a collegiate game.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, attendance is growing at USC home games, as both Miner and the team  get better and better.  </P> <P> No matter who is out there watching him, Miner is a performer suitable for  children or adults. He is a sensation with the critics, even if he is not yet  big box office, and we definitely give him thumbs up.  </P> <P> "Hey, it doesn't matter if it's a hundred people," Miner said. "When Doctor J  was playing at Massachusetts, he was always playing in front of empty crowds."  </P></p>

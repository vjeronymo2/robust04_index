			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / SPD criticises business leaders The German opposition Social Democrat (SPD) leader, Mr Rudolf Scharping, has rebuked business leaders for throwing their weight behind the conservative chancellor, Mr Helmut Kohl, ahead of elections on October 16. In a letter to Mr Hans Peter Stihl, head of the German Federation of Chambers of Commerce (DIHT), made public yesterday, Mr Scharping defended his party's policies and denied that taxes would rise under an SPD government. Mr Stihl said last week that an SPD victory would be bad for the economy and the labour market.</p>

			<p><P> June 25, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NO POLITICAL STORMS AHEAD FOR BUSH'S STILL POND  </P> <P> Look fast: George Bush is completing one of his periodic transformations from  wimp to titan. After being canonized as a political Goliath for his  come-from-behind thrashing of Michael S. Dukakis, Bush spent his electoral  honeymoon on the couch, listening to the Washington Establishment condemn him  for caution, indecisiveness and apparently terminal blandness. Now his notices  are shifting again. Bush's proposal to cut troops in Europe received a  thundering response abroad; his plan for controlling air pollution was warmly  welcomed at home. Bush's job-approval and personal ratings have soared.  </P> <P> Perhaps most important, Bush is confounding Democratic efforts to develop a  line of attack against him. Though it remains early in the Administration, the  Democrats' inability to draw a bead on Bush has implications for the 1990  midterm elections and for the 1992 presidential race. It often seems that  political campaigns pivot on a few weeks of misleading TV commercials and  orchestrated sound bites, but the themes that dominate national elections  usually simmer for years. Right now, for the Democrats, nothing is cooking.  </P> <P> By this point in Jimmy Carter's presidency, the perception of the former  Georgia governor as incompetent at home and overmatched abroad -- central  pillars of the GOP case against him in 1980 -- was percolating through  political circles. By this point in Ronald Reagan's first term, Democrats were  blasting him for "unfairness" in his economic priorities, belligerence toward  the Soviet Union and indifference toward the environment -- issues Walter F.  Mondale tried against him in 1984.  </P> <P> In sharp contrast, the opposition brief against Bush hasn't taken form. If  Reagan's first year was a war, Bush's is a snore. "Nobody is making a coherent  case against George Bush right now," said Democratic pollster Mark Mellman.  </P> <P> That's not only because the Democrats have been too busy dressing their own  wounded on Capitol Hill to take aim at the White House. Bush hasn't given the  Democrats much to shoot at. He's pushed a centrist agenda that doesn't inspire  outrage. At the same time, when pressed enough, he's capably rejoined charges  that his agenda is too modest: After Democrats accused Bush of ignoring Soviet  arms-reduction initiatives, he unveiled his surprisingly bold proposal for  troop cuts in Europe -- and changed the issue's political dynamic overnight.  </P> <P> Bush has been much less prone than Reagan to box himself into constricting  ideological corners. That flexibility has allowed him to commandeer a strong  middle-ground position on several issues that help Democrats, particularly arms  control and the environment. He cut his losses on aid to the Nicaraguan  Contras. The congressional Democrats haven't been able to get far enough away  from Bush to effectively fire on him; even in the continuing legislative fight  over the minimum wage, the difference between the President and Congress is  only 30 cents. Except for Bush's uncertain handling of the Alaskan oil spill  and his opposition to abortion, liberal interest groups have had nothing to  rally against.  </P> <P> "Bush has not broken off big chunks of the population and declared them the  enemy or allowed them to declare themselves the enemy," said one White House  aide. "He is not going about this in a polarizing way. The reason the lines of  attack aren't there isn't because of some neo-Teflon quality of Bush; it's that  there is no ideological issues base from which to oppose him."  </P> <P> As the new House leadership settles into place, the Democrats will do a better  job of building that base. But the party faces a larger problem in drawing a  line against Bush: catching the public's attention. Before the 1988 campaign,  many Democratic strategists, and even some Republicans, predicted the nation  was approaching a cyclical turning point -- when its focus would shift from  private concerns that defined the 1980s to the public initiatives that animated  the 1960s. But those hopes have been disappointed: Even in Washington, there's  little sense now that government is the driving force in American life. Next to  the tumultuous events shaking the communist world, Washington's paralyzing  obsession with personality and peccadillo seems trivial -- a food fight on  history's fringe. The public has recoiled accordingly.  </P> <P> That disinterest subtly strengthens Bush, whose public agenda is far more  limited than congressional Democrats'. Democrats continue to take heart from  polls that show voters want to confront such social problems as drugs and  homelessness. But those attitudes remain diffuse and not necessarily aimed at  government action. After absorbing eight years of Reagan's homilies against big  government, Americans don't expect much from Washington; in one recent survey  only 25% of the voters said they expected any significant help. That atrophied  view of government responsibility has lowered the standard Bush must meet.  </P> <P> In all this, reality matters. Traditionally, Americans don't ask much of  government as long as it seems to have big issues under control -- the economy,  international relations. And at that tectonic level of politics, too, the  underlying forces now look to be grinding in Bush's direction.  </P> <P> Pre-eminent among these is Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's apparently  boundless determination to reach accommodation with the West. Gorbachev's need  to divert resources from military to domestic spending are driving him to reach  agreements with the United States limiting both intercontinental nuclear  weapons and conventional forces in Europe. As the Cold War fades, Bush's luster  can only brighten.  </P> <P> Economic forces also boost Bush. Because of demographic trends, the economy  over the next decade will have to provide jobs for fewer new workers than  during the 1970s and early 1980s. Without a major recession, unemployment --  now at a politically insignificant 5% -- will stay low. Inflation, the most  immediate economic concern, remains an issue where Republicans have more  credibility than Democrats; besides, few experts expect prices to heat up soon.  </P> <P> The flip side of these positive trends, for the White House, is that they  entrench the Democrats' congressional majority. Bush's consensus-building may  make it difficult for Democrats to challenge him, but it frustrates Republicans  trying to create the polarizing issues that could dislodge Democrats in 1990.  Bush's low-key style may also prevent his putting down deep roots with the  public that could anchor him if events turn sour. If he has any doubts, he  could check this with Dukakis.  </P> <P> Nothing in politics remains constant. But no storms that could disturb this  political equilibrium seem to be gathering on the horizon.  </P> <P> Republicans are trying to make congressional ethics a major issue for the 1990  election, but there's little evidence that people are paying attention. Recent  polls continue to show the dichotomy: No matter how much the people revile  Congress as a whole, they consider their own representative a model of civic  virtue.  </P> <P> Now controlled by an activist conservative majority, the U.S. Supreme Court  could send more ripples into Washington's still pond. The court's recent series  of decisions limiting affirmative action could force Congress to revisit the  issue -- unsettling Democrats, who are trying to regain the votes of  middle-class whites generally hostile to such programs. But Republicans, trying  to attract blacks without offending their white base, won't be much happier.  Neither side is anxious for a sweeping court decision on abortion. A decision  restricting or overturning the 1973 ruling to legalize abortion might make that  emotional issue the dominant concern in 1990 gubernatorial and statehouse  races, with unpredictable results.  </P> <P> Still more important is the public's nagging long-term anxiety about America's  faltering international economic competitiveness, symbolized by the persistent  trade deficit. Polls continue to show that voters fear the nation is falling  behind Japan and other foreign competitors and could face an eroding standard  of living over the next generation.  </P> <P> These doubts remain a potentially powerful political force. But they were  present during the 1988 presidential race and, despite the Democrats' best  efforts, never became a cutting issue -- largely because voters remained  satisfied with their immediate economic circumstances. It will probably take a  recession to focus those long-term anxieties enough to affect elections,  Democratic strategists acknowledge. If that's so, it means Democrats may again  need an economic reversal to bring the White House into their sights.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENTS: A GUIDE TO THE BEST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA: RITUALS;  </P> <P> SOME GOOD THINGS NEVER CHANGE  </P> <P> IT'S AN old-fashioned oasis, a place where you can relax your way back into the  civility of a bygone era. High-backed wooden booths have cosseted rich and not  necessarily famous Angelenos since 1919; meals are still respectfully served on  linen place mats to solo diners at the counter.  </P> <P> In the bar, shaded wall lamps give off a warm glow as another cloudy Saturday  afternoon slips into the cocktail hour.  </P> <P> The room is dark and cozy, like a gentlemen's club. You can't quite make out  the pale-green pastoral mural that encircles the room, but the dim light  catches the leaded-glass panes of the liquor cabinets behind the dark-wood bar.  Perched happily on a red-leather bar stool, you can witness, through his  reflection in the mirror, the stately bartender in the de rigueur white shirt,  black tie and red jacket as he smoothly makes an honest-to-goodness vodka  gimlet on the rocks, just as he's done for the past 22 years -- the way it  should be done: ice into tumbler, a generous jigger of vodka, a splash of lime  juice until the concoction is just the right golden-green. Cheers.  </P> <P>  Straightforward cocktails in an old-fashioned atmosphere at Musso &amp; Frank  Grill, 6667 Hollywood Blvd., Hollywood; (213) 467-5123.  </P> <P> ROBIN TUCKER  </P></p>

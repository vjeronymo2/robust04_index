			<p>940616 FT  16 JUN 94 / Russia pressed on air safety The International Air Transport Association (Iata) is urging Russia to enforce more stringent licensing procedures for new airlines and improve flight safety standards in the face of an alarming increase in the country's air accident rate. Iata is also worried by flight safety standards in the rapidly growing Chinese market. Mr Pierre Jeanniot, Iata's director-general, yesterday said he had written to the Russian authorities recommending that they be 'more cautious' in granting licences for airlines being established following the break-up of Aeroflot. Iata officials said civil aviation figures from the former Soviet Union showed 'a considerable decrease' in safety last year and so far this year. Although the volume of air traffic has been falling because of high fares and poor service standards, the number of deaths caused by air accidents increased last year to 348 people compared with 250 in 1992. This year the figure is likely to be even worse, following the Aeroflot Airbus A310 crash and another fatal accident involving a Russian-built Tupolev Tu-154 airliner. But on China, Mr Jeanniot said he was encouraged by the Beijing government's decision to limit the number of new licences it is issuing for new domestic airline operations. 'China realised they were getting a bit thin to ensure safety standards and decided to curb growth a little to ensure better safety,' he said.</p>

			<p><P> November 13, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORKERS WITH BEST BENEFITS STAND TO LOSE MOST  </P> <P> Richard E. Cecconi retired on March 31, 1986, after 30 years with Republic  Steel in Warren, Ohio. He was 50, his pension was $2,309 a month and his  retirement looked secure.  </P> <P> Then Republic's parent, Dallas-based LTV Corp., declared bankruptcy, and the  federal Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. took over LTV's underfunded pension  plans in the biggest pension bailout ever.  </P> <P> Cecconi and thousands of other LTV workers learned what pension rights  advocates have long warned -- workers with the best pension benefits stand to  lose the most when the PBGC moves in. Cecconi's pension was cut to $632 a  month.  </P> <P> "There is no fairness here," Cecconi said. "I was not an early retiree. I  worked the full 30 years necessary to qualify for a full pension, and now get  only 27%."  </P> <P> But without the PBGC, Cecconi and 108,000 other LTV workers and retirees would  have gotten far less.  </P> <P> "The main purpose of the PBGC was to make sure that people didn't see their  pensions totally wiped out, and it has been a very definite success," said Alan  V. Reuther, associate general counsel at the United Auto Workers. "As difficult  as LTV was, it would have been a complete disaster without the PBGC."  </P> <P> The agency was created by Congress in 1974 as part of a package of  pension-protection measures known as the Employee Retirement Income Security  Act. Its mission was similar to that of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.,  which insures bank deposits up to $100,000 per account.  </P> <P> When the PBGC becomes trustee of a pension plan that does not have enough money  to pay its obligations, the agency pays the pensions up to a certain maximum.  The ceiling was $750 a month in 1974 and has risen to $2,028 for 1989.  </P> <P> The agency guarantees only basic benefits available at age 65 under the company  plan. Those who retire before 65, such as Cecconi, receive less under a  formula. For instance, a worker who takes early retirement at 55 will receive  about half the PBGC maximum.  </P> <P> The agency does not guarantee health and welfare benefits, and pension  increases granted by the company in the five years before the plan ended are  reduced according to a formula.  </P> <P> The PBGC insures the pensions of 40 million workers and retirees covered by  defined-benefit plans, the type promising a specific amount based on age,  service and salary. Another 36 million workers have defined-contribution plans,  such as profit-sharing and 401(k) savings plans, which are not insured.  </P></p>

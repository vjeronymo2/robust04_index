			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Hong Kong hint pushes C&amp;W down RUMOUR that CITIC, the Chinese government's investment agency, is planning a major placing of HK Telecom shares, perhaps as much as a 5 per cent stake in the equity, after it announces its results tomorrow, badly upset the share price of Cable and Wireless, parent company of the Hong Kong group. C&amp;W retains a near 58 per cent holding in HK Telecom and dealers took the view that any sale of CITIC's stock would trigger a slide in Telecom's share price. Shares in C&amp;W slipped at the outset of trading, reflecting the late sudden downward movement of the Hong Kong market, which closed only marginally higher after being substantially firmer at first. After reaching a peak 509p on Monday, the shares opened easier yesterday at 502p, and moved lower to close a net 11 1/2 off at 491p after another session of well above average turnover of 10m. CITIC acquired its near 17 per cent HK Telecom stake in December 1989, for an average HKDollars 4.50 a share and, according to UK dealers, could seek to lock in substantial profits now that the shares stand above HKDollars 17 apiece. 'The Chinese would be looking at a massive profit of over Pounds 1bn from their holding,' said one specialist. He mentioned 'a massive US appetite for Far Eastern and particularly Hong Kong stocks in recent months'. Because of its 17 per cent shareholding in HK Telecom, CITIC would be prevented from selling any of its HK Telecom shares in London because of the 'closed period' rules.</p>

			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / Survey of Bermuda (11): Cruises lead a recovery - Richard Lapper finds tourism emerging from its recent decline NEWS of a prospective Dollars 131m project to redevelop the Bermudiana hotel has bolstered confidence in the island's tourism industry, which is slowly beginning to recover following five years of worrying decline. Last month, Bermuda Financial Centre (BFC), a group of mainly local Bermudian investors, announced plans to buy the Bermudiana, a vast pink hulk overlooking Hamilton harbour, moth-balled by its owners, Trust House Forte, the UK hotel group, since 1988. BFC aims to demolish the hotel and covert it into a new 330-room 'business hotel' and office complex, providing living and working accommodation for businessmen visiting the island's international financial centre. One million dollars has been invested so far and BFC aims to raise Dollars 45m in equity capital. It will then borrow a further Dollars 85m to fund Bermuda's biggest-ever construction project. First Bermuda Securities, a local securities firm, is orchestrating the development together with Canada's Gordon Capital. One of the firm's founders, Jeffrey Conyers, says the new hotel will provide a 'focus' for the island's international financial centre, confirming Bermuda's reputation as a place 'where serious business is being done'. The group plans to convert at least a third of the rooms into executive suites and will also build a conference centre. The buoyancy of Bermuda's offshore financial business, especially the surge of investment in insurance, is propelling recovery among hoteliers in other ways as well. Professor Brian Archer, a Manchester-based academic who has surveyed the economic impact of international business, says that the 7,000 business travellers who came to Bermuda in 1991 were accompanied by 'approximately 7,000 friends and relatives'. Professor Archer says that the expenditure of these visitors was 'considerable', amounting to a total of Dollars 8.4m during 1991, or just over Dollars 1,000 per couple. A number of hotels are earning an increasing proportion of their revenues from business travellers. The Southampton Princess, one of the island's biggest hotels, is particularly well known as a conference centre, for example. Government officials estimate that more than one in 10 'tourist arrivals' are, in fact, businessmen who choose not to declare the real purpose of their visit on immigration forms. Meanwhile, overall tourist numbers have begun to recover over the past 12 months, halting a steady decline which has plunged its biggest hotels into the red. After climbing to an all-time high of 631,314 in 1987, the number of annual visitors fell steadily during the late 1980s to reach 547,480 in 1990, 514,329 in 1991 and 506,237 in 1992, the lowest levels for nearly 20 years. Bermuda's eight biggest hotels between them reported a total loss of about Dollars 17m in the 12 months to September 1992. Always an expensive place to visit, Bermuda was hard hit by the downturn in the US economy - especially severe in the north-east and mid-Atlantic states, from where nearly 60 per cent of the island's visitors come. The Gulf War made many would-be visitors jittery about international flights, even though Bermuda lies only 568 miles east of North Carolina. Bermuda has not benefited from the fierce price competition among US airlines which has made many domestic destinations, especially Florida and California, more attractive. Gary Phillips, director of tourism, says that demand in the US has begun to pick up this year. The recovery is being led by the cruise ship sector, with numbers up by 14 per cent. Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines and Norwegian Cruise Lines have both deployed new, larger ships this year to sail on their regular weekly cruises from US east coast ports to Bermuda. RCCL's 'Song of America' has increased berth numbers by 250 to 1,330, while NCL's 'Dreamward' has 1,400 berths, nearly double the number available on 'Westward', the ship it replaces. Both these lines, as well as US-based Celebrity Cruises, are reported to be experiencing buoyant levels of demand. The hotels, meanwhile, have also seen visitor numbers increase over the past few months. John Harvey, director of the Bermuda Hotels Association, says occupancy levels have begun to recover. He expects the biggest eight hotels to break even in when they report results for the 12 months to September 1993 in the next few weeks. The main obstacle to overcome is the view that Bermuda 'gets very cold during these months', says Mr Phillips. About half of Bermuda' hotels have offered to reduce room rates by 20 per cent on each day that temperatures fall below 68 degrees. Visitors taking advantage of the scheme in the first three months of the year obtained discounted rates for about 20 days. Local shopkeepers joined in the scheme, by offering price reductions on the cooler days, while some hoteliers offered other discounts, such as free accommodation to children under 12. Bermuda is also attempting to promote itself as a 'long haul' destination for European visitors. Here, however, the island is handicapped by inadequate air-connections, especially with potentially lucrative German and Scandinavian markets. Although British Airways reports a high level of occupancy for its regular direct flights from Heathrow, the airline has no plans to increase frequency from the current levels of three times a week between May and October and twice a week for the rest of the year. As a result, travellers face a 12 hour journey via New York. So far, neither the government nor local hotel operators have enjoyed any success in their efforts to attract other airlines to fly direct routes. Nor have they been prepared to entice charter operators to fly to the island by sharing the cost of any losses.</p>

			<p><P> March 31, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BADLY SHOCKED BEAR AND CUB BACK IN WILDS  </P> <P> A mother bear and her cub were returned to their mountain home seven months  after she suffered a 7,200-volt shock and burns as she fell, drugged by  tranquilizer darts, from a utility pole in the city.  </P> <P> Scott Brown, a spokesman for the state Department of Game and Fish, said the  release of the two bears went off without a hitch Thursday.  </P> <P> Brown said the mother bear was fitted with a radio collar so biologists can  monitor her for the next couple of weeks.  </P> <P> The mother bear had wandered into Albuquerque last August and climbed a 25-foot  utility pole. When a wildlife official shot her with a tranquilizer gun, she  fell, brushing a transformer, which caused the shock and burns.  </P></p>

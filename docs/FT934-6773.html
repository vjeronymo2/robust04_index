			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / International Company News: Krone devaluation hits Carlsberg Price competition and krone devaluation prevented Carlsberg from translating a 29 per cent increase in the volume of beer sold in the year ended September into matching increases in profits and turnover. Turnover increased by 4.2 per cent to DKr15.59bn (Dollars 2.29bn) from DKr14.95bn, including excise taxes. Operating profits dipped to DKr1.08bn from DKr1.16bn, although after net financial income, pre-tax profits rose by DKr18m to DKr1.36bn. The results also include a DKr200m charge to meet structural changes 'in anticipation of ever-increasing competition affecting the brewing industry in Denmark and especially abroad'. Earnings per share were up slightly to DKr14.24 from DKr13.36, but the group's return on equity slipped slightly to 13.7 from 14.6 per cent. Carlsberg is paying an unchanged DKr3 per share dividend. The increase in turnover was held back by currency changes. If exchange rates had been stable, pre-tax profits would have been about 8 per cent higher than the published figure, Carlsberg said. Carlsberg-Tetley, the group's UK joint venture, is included in the accounts for nine months. The venture contributed to a significant increase in beer sales in the UK, Carlsberg said. Intensifying competition will have an adverse effect on future earnings, partly because of higher marketing expenditures, said Carlsberg. However, the group expects to consolidate its position as an important player on the international brewing scene in the second half of the decade, it said.</p>

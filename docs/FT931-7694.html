			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Board shake-up at Harmony HARMONY LEISURE, the loss-making pubs and restaurants group, yesterday announced sweeping board changes and proposals for a rights issue following an evaluation of its poor trading performance by Guinness Mahon, the merchant bank. Mr Bob Dawson, chairman, and Mr John Lever, a director, have resigned from the board. Mr Stanley Lever is to relinquish his position as managing director, although he will remain in a non-executive capacity. Mr John Main, a director at Southend Property Holdings, was named yesterday as chairman and chief executive. He has been joined on the board by Mr Martin Marcus, joint managing director of Queens Moat Houses. Southend Property and Queens Moat together control almost 20 per cent of Harmony's share capital. Mr Marcus said the new board was preparing a rights issue in a bid to restore Harmony's capital base which has been depleted by accumulated losses of Pounds 6.9m over the past three years. 'The management of Harmony was unsatisfactory and the company needs extra equity by way of assets and cash,' he said yesterday. The proposed rights issue, which has yet to be approved by shareholders, is likely to involve issuing new ordinary shares of 5p; it was not clear last night what the ratio would be for existing shares. Mr John Main said the full terms would be announced shortly. Such a rights issue would help Harmony build a new vehicle for asset investment, he added. 'The whole company is very tired and needs to be rejuvenated,' he said. The appointment of Mr Main follows mounting concern at the group's performance, which escalated last year after Harmony announced interim pre-tax losses of Pounds 344,000 in the six months to September 27. Yesterday the company also announced a profits warning for the six months to the end of March this year and said there would be a 'significant pre-tax loss' for the full year. The Harmony board has been under increasing pressure since rebel shareholders launched a campaign for the appointment of new non-executive directors last October.</p>

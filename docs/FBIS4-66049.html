			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by M. Abizanda: "Army Will Reinforce Its Rapid </F> Action Force With Armored Vehicles"]    [Text] Madrid -- The Army will reinforce the Rapid Action  Force [FAR] by including a cavalry group in this unit. Although  it was not initially planned that the FAR would have this kind  of unit, confining itself to light infantry forces, the  experience of participation in the UN mission in  Bosnia-Herzegovina has shown the feasibility of including these  new resources.    The FAR's final makeup will be determined following the  approval of the Force's mission, depending on the redeployment  plans that are currently being drafted by the three services'  staffs and are at their final stage of completion. With the  document approved by the defense minister 25 January -- the new  Strategic Concept -- it will in turn be incorporated in the  final Joint Strategic Plan, which, according to the Defense  Ministry's forecasts, could be approved before the summer.    The Army wishes to reinforce the FAR through the Master Plan  with cavalry equipment -- especially cavalry reconnaissance  armored vehicles -- in order to provide it with semiheavy  equipment capable of carrying out reconnaissance missions and  equipped with a gun of at least 25mm calibers.    The experience of the various battalions in  Bosnia-Herzegovina has shown the need for these resources, to  such an extent that it is stated in military circles that  Operation "Alfa Bravo" has marked the rediscovery of the cavalry.    For this reason, the FAR will have a cavalry group  comprising  two groups (battalions) charged with reconnaissance and  protection tasks. The sources consulted stated that this group  will almost certainly have its base in Valladolid, although  Valencia was initially chosen for its location. Two cavalry  regiments belonging to the Jarama Brigade, destined to become at  the most a territorial defense unit -- that is, with personnel  not exceeding 30 percent of its potential, in accordance with  the Master Plan -- currently have their base in Valladolid.    In the latest drafts of this plan it is ruled out that the  FAMET (Army Airmobile Forces) will be completely incorporated  into the FAR -- the main unit to be deployed in the event of a  crisis or for participation in international missions. The  aforementioned sources stated that only a proportion of their  six battalions will be assigned.    In addition, it is confirmed that the FAR's three main units  will be the paratroopers' brigade, the legionnaires' brigade,  and the light airborne brigade, although some changes in their  deployment have been envisaged. In the case of the  legionnnaires' brigade, the idea of moving the 4th Corps from  Ronda to the Viator base in Almeria seems to have been dropped.  The military chiefs believe that it would be a waste to abandon  its current facilities there.    In this event, only the 3d Corps in Fuerteventura will move  to Almeria, to be joined by an artillery group as well as a  logistical unit. Units outside the peninsula in Ceuta and  Melilla will remain in their current locations.    The idea is that, within the FAR itself, the paratroopers'  brigade and the Legion will be the initial-reaction group, while  the airborne brigade, with bases in Galicia and Asturias, would  be the second echelon to be deployed.    In addition, the FAR's staff, under the command of General  Victor Suances, remains in charge of Operation "Alfa Bravo,"  although the Cordoba Group's units belong not to that unit but  to the Southern Operational Command and to the brigades within  the Reaction Force.</p>

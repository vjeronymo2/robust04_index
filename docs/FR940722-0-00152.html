An applicant's request for the return of his application after it has been accepted for filing will be considered to be a request for dismissal without prejudice. Applicants requesting dismissal of their applications may be subject to penalties contained in &sect;1.2104 of this Chapter. Requests for dismissal shall comply with the provisions of &sect;24.829 as appropriate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) A request to dismiss an application without prejudice will be considered after designation for hearing only if: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) A written petition is submitted to the Commission and is properly served upon all parties of record, and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The petition complies with the provisions of &sect;24.829 (whenever applicable) and demonstrates good cause. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) The Commission will dismiss an application for failure to prosecute or for failure to respond substantially within a specified time period to official correspondence or requests for additional information. Dismissal shall be without prejudice if made prior to designation for hearing or prior to auction, but dismissal may be made with prejudice for unsatisfactory compliance with &sect;24.829 or after designation for hearing or after the applicant is notified that it is the winning bidder under the auction process. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;24.829 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Ownership changes and agreements to amend or to dismiss applications or pleadings. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Applicability. Subject to the provisions of &sect;1.2105 of this Chapter (Bidding Application and Certification Procedures; Prohibition of Collusion), this section applies to applicants and all other parties interested in pending applications who wish to resolve contested matters among themselves with a formal or an informal agreement or understanding. This section applies only when the agreement or understanding will result in: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) A major change in the ownership of an applicant to which &sect;&sect;24.823(c) and 24.823(g) apply or which would cause the applicant to lose its status as a designated entity under &sect;24.709, or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The individual or mutual withdrawal, amendment or dismissal of any pending application amendment, petition or other pleading. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Policy. Parties to contested proceedings are encouraged to settle their disputes among themselves. Parties that, under a settlement agreement, apply to the Commission for ownership changes or for the amendment or dismissal of either pleadings or applications shall at the time of filing notify the Commission that such filing is the result of an agreement or understanding. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) The provisions of &sect;22.927 of the Commission's Rules will apply in the event of the filing of petitions to deny or other pleadings or informal objections filed against broadband PCS applications.

This subsection does not apply, however, to petitioners who gain standing because of the major amendment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;24.831 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Mutually exclusive applications. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) The Commission will consider applications for broadband PCS licenses to be mutually exclusive if they relate to the same geographical boundaries (MTA or BTA) and are timely filed for the same frequency block. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Mutually exclusive applications filed on Form 175 for the initial provision of broadband PCS are subject to competitive bidding in accordance with the procedures in Subpart H of this part and in Part 1, Subpart Q of this Chapter. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) An application will be entitled to comparative consideration with one or more conflicting applications only if the Commission determines that such comparative consideration will serve the public interest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d)&hyph;(j) [Reserved] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

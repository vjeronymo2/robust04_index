Editor Says Fall of Government Matter of Time    5. Human Rights Organizations Condemn Attack on Lawyers    6. Muslim Brotherhood Issues Statement on Recent Violence    7.

Will Shaykh al-Ghazali Deliver 'Id al-Adha Sermon?  <H5>  TRADE UNIONS EXPRESS SOLIDARITY WITH LAWYERS AFTER ATTACK </H5>   The newspaper devotes its front page and many inside pages  to  reports, comments, interviews, and pictures of the government's  violent confrontation of the demonstration staged by the Lawyers  Association [LA] in Cairo on 17 May to protest the death of  lawyer 'Abd-al-Harith Madani while in police custody. Under the  banner headline "Flagrant Aggression Against the Lawyers'  Demonstration," Ashraf Khalil writes a 600-word report on pages  1 and 7 in which he says representatives of the various  professional associations held an emergency meeting to discuss  the developments in the LA "after the security forces shelled  their peaceful march with rockets and tear gas bombs." The  report says the conferees were demanding the immediate release  of detained LA Council members and a speedy investigation into  the circumstances that led to the death of Lawyer 'Abd-al-Harith  Madani. The conferees are also cited as having expressed full  solidarity with the LA Council. According to the report, the LA  Council officially asked the public prosecutor "to immediately  investigate the security forces' excesses" against the lawyers.  The Council declared a state of emergency and considered itself  in permanent session. A statement from the Council reportedly  blames the interior minister and security commanders for the  incidents. The statement demands the immediate release of all  detained lawyers and rejects the charges brought against them.    A 600-word report by 'Ala' al-Bahhar and Khalid Yunus on  page  4 discusses the arrest of several leading LA council members and  other activist lawyers. It says security forces raided the  houses of those people at dawn and took them to police stations.  The report says the lawyers formed a committee to defend the  detainees and rushed to the office of the public prosecutor to  condemn the "oppressive measures."  <H5>  CORRESPONDENTS DESCRIBE VIOLENCE AT LAWYERS' DEMONSTRATION </H5>   On pages 2 and 3, the paper gives an on-the-spot account of  what it describes as "the brutal aggression against lawyers" in  front of the LA headquarters in Cairo. It introduces its  stories -- a 800-word report by 'Abd-al-Rahman Isma'il on page  2, a 700-word report by Salah Budaywi on page 2, and an  1,500-word report by Mu'tazz al-Hadidi and Subhi Buhayri on page  3 -- by an unattributed comment that reads in part: "The  government has added to its criminal antihuman rights record two  new characteristics: stupidity and ignorance. Can any sane  person attack the protectors of law with bullets and tear gas  inside their association? It is an open invitation in the most  intense form of extremism, and an opening to the doors of hell.  It gives violence -- which all of us reject -- a fertile soil  to flourish and take full control." The comment adds: "The  government perpetrated its crime and was caught red-handed. The  evidence is conclusive. So, what is the government waiting for  before it leaves? Through its unsuccessful policy, the  government has placed the entire country on the edge of a  volcano that may erupt at any moment if the ignorant ones fail  to return to their senses."    The three reports detail the situation before, during, and  after the confrontation between the lawyers and the security  forces in Cairo. They describe the heavy security cordon  imposed around the LA building before the demonstration, how  police officers threatened the organizers of the march and  harassed journalists, how "hundreds" of lawyers suffocated from  tear gas, and how security forces chased lawyers and citizens in  nearby streets and conducted random arrest campaigns. The  reports also cite lawyer leaders addressing the crowd before the  demonstration. They reportedly demanded that the government  stop torture and exceptional rules, and they urged lawyers to  demonstrate unity and remain the strong defenders of law and  freedom.   <H5>    LAWYERS ASSOCIATION DOYEN INTERVIEWED </H5>   Page 2 also contains an approximately 1,500-word interview  with Ahmad al-Khawajah, the doyen of the Lawyers Association,  who, unlike most of the LA Council members, is not affiliated  with the Islamic trend. Al-Khawajah refuses to blame the  government for the incidents, but he describes the confrontation  as "a serious setback for democracy." He notes the "over  enthusiasm" of some young lawyers and says the problems arising  from lawyer 'Abd-al-Harith Madani's death could have been solved  through dialogue. Expressing his belief that there are  suspicious circumstances behind Madani's death, he explains his  efforts and contacts to reveal the truth of the matter.  <H5>  EDITOR SAYS FALL OF GOVERNMENT MATTER OF TIME </H5>   In a 1,000-word article entitled "The Government Is Banging  Its Head Against the Wall", Chief Editor Majdi Ahmad Husayn  writes on page 1 that the government opted for "the brute force"  to face the lawyers' moves after the "torture to death" of one  of their colleagues. This, he says, reflects the weakness of  the government, which fears that even a single demonstration may  bring it down. Noting the various forms of oppression that the  government uses to impose itself on the people by force, Husayn  comments: "I tell you: your attempts will go in vain.  Prolonging the life of a patient in the intensive care unit by  artificial means will not be useful. It will only delay the  date of the funeral, but the funeral is inevitable, as you know.  The country cannot be ruled by tear gas and plastic bullets;  this is new proof of the political void which the government and  the hollow ruling party represent."  <H5>  HUMAN RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS CONDEMN ATTACK ON LAWYERS </H5>   Page 4 contains unattributed reports on statements by the  Egyptian Organization of Human Rights [EOHR] and the  London-Based Liberty organization denouncing the attack against  the lawyers. The Egyptian organization's statement reportedly  says: "The EOHR condemns the use of force by the security  forces to break up the peaceful demonstration of the Egyptian  lawyers because it is a violation of Article 54 of the Egyptian  Constitution, which gives citizens the right to gather in a  peaceful manner without prior notice. It is also a violation of  Egypt's international obligations under Article 21 of the  international convention on civilian and political rights, which  was ratified by the Egyptian Government. The EOHR views the  attack as new incriminating evidence against the authorities'  position toward the citizens' right to express their views by  all peaceful means, foremost through demonstrations and peaceful  gathering." The EOHR also reportedly sent a letter to President  Mubarak expressing "profound fears" that lawyer 'Abd-al-Harith  Madani died as a result of torture. The letter urges the  president to conduct an immediate and honest inquiry into his  death.  <H5>  MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD ISSUES STATEMENT ON RECENT VIOLENCE </H5>   Page 4 also includes a 700-word report on a statement by the  Muslim Brotherhood discussing the recent developments and  maintaining that the group has never advocated sedition or  violent confrontations.  <H5>  POLITICIANS, TRADE UNIONISTS REACT ANGRILY TO POLICE VIOLENCE </H5>   Page 5 contains three reports on reactions to the police  confrontation of the lawyers' demonstration. In the first  1,800-word report, 'Abd-al-Hayy Muhammad and 'Adil al-Bahnasawi  cite some party and trade union officials as condemning or  regretting the incident. Liberal Party Leader Mustafa Kamil  Murad is cited as saying that the police made a grave mistake in  using force against the demonstration. Counselor Ma'mun  al-Hudaybi, spokesman for the Muslim Brotherhood is cited as  saying: "We regret and denounce what has happened. It is  people's right to express their views as long as this is done in  a peaceful and civilized manner. The use of force was  meaningless. But what can we do knowing that the current regime  is now characterized by violence, viciousness, and unjust  oppression, and that state violence has become a firm policy?"    The second 1,500-word report by Tariq 'Abd-al-Hamid, and the  third 1,500-word report by Khalid Yunus cite reactions by some  lawyer leaders in Cairo and the governorates. They all denounce  "government terrorism" and violation of law and human rights.  <H5>  WILL SHAYKH AL-GHAZALI DELIVER 'ID AL-ADHA SERMON? </H5>   A 50-word announcement-like report on page 1 says leaders  and  members of the Labor party in Cairo will tomorrow, 21 May,  perform the 'Id al-Adha prayers in Mustafa Mahmud mosque in  Cairo. The report says Islamic preacher Shaykh Muhammad  al-Ghazali will deliver the 'Id sermon. [Cairo al-Wafd in  Arabic on 24 May reports that the government barred Shaykh  al-Ghazali from delivering the sermon]</p>

			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / Observer: On guard The Lord Mayor Sir Paul Newall, in Kuwait City yesterday during what was supposed to have been a routine Gulf trade tour, was at least well prepared. Britain may be mustering only a paltry collection of troops to send to the Kuwaitis' assistance, but the Lord Mayor's team should pass muster. Sir Paul did part of his national service with the Royal Fusiliers in the Sudan. His swordbearer Colonel John Ansell was with the Trucial Oman Scouts in the 1950s and was attached to the Kuwaiti armed forces in the early 1980s. Even the third member of the party, the 'chief commoner' John Holland, is an honorary colonel in a TA parachute battalion. On this occasion the extra baggage in a Lord Mayor's overseas junket seems justifiable.</p>

			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] The 21 May HANGUK ILBO reported on page  31 that the Pusan District Prosecutor's Office has arrested Yi  Chang-sung for distributing philopon [crystal methamphetamine]  and heroin from Thailand. The authorities also have arrest  warrants for Kim Chong-kyu who is suspected of engineering the  smuggling, and two others for carrying the drugs into the  country. Yi was arrested with 226 grams of philopon and 287  grams of heroin. The Golden Triangle heroin has been found in  the past, but this the first time Thai-manufactured philopon and  Thai-processed heroin were found in Korea.    According to the Prosecutor's Office, in February, Kim  Chong-kyu smuggled one kilogram each of philopon and heroin  worth eight billion won from Bangkok, Thailand, and Yi has  helped sell these drugs since March. The authorities had a tip  that Kim made three trips to Thailand this year alone and he  supposedly smuggled five kilograms of Thai philopon into Korea  on his April trip.

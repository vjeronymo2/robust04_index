			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / City prepared to finance cable TV The UK cable television industry is expected to raise between Pounds 2bn and Pounds 2.5bn in debt finance this year to build cable networks, a much higher figure than expected and an indication of the changed City attitudes to the sector. The forecast came yesterday from Mr Gary Stephen, head of media and telecommunications at NatWest Markets. He told the FT Cable and Satellite conference in London that there was 'a sea change' last year in the way the market valued cable assets. The International Cabletel deal in New York, in which the UK cable interests of Insight Communications merged with OCom, a quoted US cellular communications company, valued a cable franchise at Pounds 250 per home even where the network had not been built. 'So in the space of 12 months, valuations per unbuilt home stretched from Pounds 10 to Pounds 250,' said Mr Stephen, who emphasised that the market was still too immature for the figure to act as a yardstick. Mr Stephen said he expected to see the emergence of publicly quoted cable companies this year. He did not give names but the industry believes that at least four of the largest companies - Telewest, Comcast, General Cable and Bell Canada - are all looking at the possibility of a flotation. Mr Jon Davey, director of cable at the Independent Television Commission, said yesterday that homes subscribing to multi-channel cable reached 611,423 by the beginning of January - a rise of 39 per cent in 12 months.</p>

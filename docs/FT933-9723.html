			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / How to Spend It: In a fashionable father's footsteps - Big designers grab the headlines but sometimes the smaller workshops and ateliers give greater pleasure. Those heading for Italy might like to know that there are some little-known craftsmen and designers whose wares are well worth tracking down DESIGNER Emilio Pucci, aristocrat, politician, soldier, artist and sportsman, died in Florence in November aged 78. But his spirit of adventure lives in his 31-year-old daughter Laudomia, who is head designer and chief executive of the fashion house built by her father and based at the family's 15th century palazzo in Florence at No 4, via Pucci. The courtyard, entrance and sweeping staircase are imposing - even intimidating. A new boutique in the trendy via della Vigna Novella, and a smaller outlet on the corner of the site occupied by the Palazzo Pucci at the via Ricasoli, will in future sell Pucci products and show how to wear them in the 1990s. These two retail outlets and a third boutique on 64th Street between 5th and Madison in New York are the only places in which the pared-down Pucci Collection can be bought. Pucci 1990s style is essentially throw-away chic: the traditional silk printed shirts (about L600,000, or Pounds 250) look great when worn over a black polo necked sweater and with black Levis. The scarves, belts and costume jewellery work well with the simplicity of Armani suits or Pucci's matching leggings and knitwear. Nobody models the look better than Laudomia Pucci herself - a strong physical presence, even in the Palazzo's Olympic-sized marble floored hall hung with ancestral portraits and lavish blue and white printed velvet drapes. Laudomia is pictured wearing a black velvet trouser suit from her 1992-93 autumn collection. The trousers are slightly flared, the long lean jacket is lined with silk in green, turquoise and blue hues that reflect the print of her gilet, which she wears over a black polo necked sweater. With tousled dark hair and no make-up, Laudomia embodies the Pucci customer in the 1990s: younger, more sophisticated and much more idiosyncratic than her 1960s counterparts. Her 1993-94 autumn collection pays homage to her father's legacy in exuberant geometric designs in silk. But the shapes are classic, clean and strong, with black acting as a foil for colour. The Pucci look now is less overtly sexy than the high-voltage colours and skin-tight shapes pioneered by her father in the 1950s and 1960s. But it still takes panache to wear it well. The summer collection is ablaze with colour and embraces an array of amusing accessories, such as a Pucci-printed baseball cap in cotton at L50,000, sunglasses at L120,000, swimsuits L150,000 to L200,000 and black cotton handbags edged in Pucci-printed braid at L250,000. Silk twill trousers and tunics with Lycra have a beautiful shine and feel. Knitwear includes fine wool trousers with silk printed front panels on both sweater and cardigan - at about L1m (Pounds 417) they are not cheap, but they will go on looking timelessly classic and classily chic for years to come. Laudomia worked on the production of ready-to-wear at Givenchy for a year and a half in the mid-1980s. She has a doctorate in economics and politics from Rome University and wrote a thesis on communist parties. 'My father was ahead of his time in design,' she says. 'But no sooner did he have an idea than he was on to the next. Execution of ideas bored him stiff. He was an artist. He liked to create.' The sassy jet-setting Pucci look which graced the likes of the then Jackie Kennedy in the 1960s faded into obscurity in the mid-1970s as women followed the lead of Yves St Laurent and later Armani, into trouser suits, padded shoulders and the androgynous look that symbolised emancipation. Emilio was bewildered - and sickened. He hated to see the female form undermined. 'For him, it was not paying service to women, who he adored until his dying breath,' says his daughter. Emilio was also baffled by the Pucci comeback in 1989 - when Laudomia entered the business full-time. He had pioneered the body conscious bodysuit in 1985 - a mode his then 23-year-old daughter said women would not dare wear. But they did dare. Laudomia has cleared out the multitude of licenses which her gadfly father signed up and which devalued the brand. She has struck an exclusive deal with Italseta over men's ties - the prints are not for wimps but are loved by Americans, Germans and Italians who have got what it takes to wear them, even at L80,000 each. Pucci's turnover is about L20bn a year, and profits are considerably less than they were in the heady days of the late 1980s. The potential for greater sales and profit is limited, and Laudomia knows that. 'This will never be a mass produced global business. This is a very special collection  -a hybrid of ready-to-wear and haute couture - which draws on the craftsmanship still available here in Florence. 'Our fabrics are hand-printed and woven specially for us. Our beading is done by a tiny band of specialists also here in Florence, and I do not know of anybody else who can supply jersey of the quality we use. Florence is still a haven of creation and craftsmanship. Were I to join the global fashion rat race it would mean moving to Milan, or New York or even Tokyo and throwing billions of lire into marketing. What I do I do with passion and great care, and I want it to remain very special.' Meanwhile, haute couture at Pucci is a snip - as there is no collection as such there are no costs to cover first. Clients say what they want, a sketch is made and a price is settled. Costs work out at some Dollars 4,000 for a short evening dress and Dollars 2,000 a jacket. Addicts include Madonna, Paloma Picasso and the Queen of Jordan.</p>

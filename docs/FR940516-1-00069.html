Facilities Affected by These NESHAP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> These NESHAP would affect BLR and WSR facilities that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are major sources in themselves, or constitute a portion of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a major source. There are three existing manufacturers of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> BLR, all of which were assumed to be major sources for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purpose of developing these standards. (Final determination  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of major source status occurs as part of the compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination process). Of the 17 existing facilities that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacture WSR, 9 were assumed to be considered major  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sources. The expected growth rate for the BLR industry and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the wet strength resin industry is expected to be between 2  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and 3 percent through 1995. Impacts associated with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control options are presented in Table 3 and Table 4; the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> options selected as proposed standards are footnoted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Cuban President Fidel Castro is scheduled to  arrive tonight in Salvador, Bahia State, on Brazil's Atlantic  coast, on his way from South Africa, where on 11 May, the  reestablishment of full diplomatic ties with South Africa was  announced.    This will be Fidel's fourth trip to Brazil. Friendship  organizations have mobilized to welcome Fidel, who has made  apparent his admiration for the Brazilian people. His previous  visits have had great repercussion in Brazil and copious  coverage by its media.    Cuba and Brazil maintain active bilateral relations and  commercial exchanges have increased lately. Brazil has commended  Cuba's health system and also used Cuban medicines, like the  meningococcal meningitis vaccine. Fidel's previous visit took  place last year during the summit in Bahia, which everyone  agrees is very similar to Cuba, and whose people are as friendly  and ebullient as the Cuban people.

			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Apollo Metals in red but improvement seen Apollo Metals, the aluminium distributor and processor, slipped into the red during the six months ended March 31, after three successive years of declining profits. Pre-tax losses for this Birmingham-based company were Pounds 219,000, compared with profits of Pounds 588,000, on turnover up slightly at Pounds 15.2m, against Pounds 14.6m. Losses per share were 2.2p, against earnings of 3p. Acknowledging that Apollo, during its first half, had reached a low point in its financial fortunes, Mr Leon Angrave, finance director since last March, said: 'We're coming out the other side. Things are starting to look a lot better for us.' This is reflected in the decision to maintain the interim dividend at 1.2p. Total payments last year were 3.6p. For most of the first half, Apollo had to cope with low metal prices and persistent pressure on margins as it acted to hold its market position. But towards the end of the half there was a perceptible change in the market. Demand increased and the producers, after capacity cuts last year, were unable to meet it. Importantly for Apollo its German subsidiary, whose expansion had been a drain on resources, came into profit during April. But the cost of reorganisation in Germany, which was Pounds 234,000 and taken as an exceptional item, wiped out operating profit of Pounds 116,000 (Pounds 771,000).</p>

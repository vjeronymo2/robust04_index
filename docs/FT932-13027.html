			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / Clinton fails to join in Barclays tax suit PRESIDENT Bill Clinton has broken with previous US government policy by deciding not to file a brief in support of Barclays Bank's suit against the California worldwide unitary tax law. Past administrations have always argued with Barclays that California's efforts to tax companies on a percentage of their worldwide profits, rather than on the profits they actually make within the state, interfered with the federal government's constitutional prerogative to 'regulate commerce with foreign nations'. The UK government and 19 other industrialised countries have filed arguments against the California tax, which runs against the bilateral tax treaties between the US and many other nations. British MPs are expected to argue for retaliation, as permitted by a 1985 UK law, during the second reading of the finance bill in parliament today. The Barclays case has been rumbling through the state and federal courts for more than a decade. California's state supreme court ruled against Barclays last year and the issue may be approaching its final round in the US Supreme Court.</p>

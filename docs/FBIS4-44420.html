			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report by Jin Guozheng (6855 0948 2398): "Communique Issued </F> by Ministry of Labor and State Statistics Bureau on Development  of Labor Industry in 1993"]    [Text] The Ministry of Labor  and the State Statistics Bureau jointly released the "Communique  on Development of Labor Industry in 1993" on 26 April. The  excerpts of the communique reads as follows:    The work concerning labor is aimed at cultivating and  developing the labor market, further reforming the labor, wage  and social security systems, improving all types of reform  measures in a comprehensive way and attaining new achievements.  However, the 1993 situation was grim in ensuring safe  production. The number of labor disputes increased greatly, and  the rate of unemployment also rose. All this merits our  attention.  <H5>  I. Labor Employment </H5>   China's labor force totalled 820 million in 1993, and those  with employment amounted to 605.9 million, up 11.58 million over  1992, of whom the number of wage-earners totalled 276.95 million  accounting for 45.7 percent of the total number of employees.  Among the wage earners, 150.4 million worked in cities and  townships; 3.1 million worked in the private sector; and 123.45  worked in rural enterprises. Among the urban workers, 110.94  million worked in state-run units, an increase of 2.05 million;  36.03 million worked in urban collectively owned units, a  decrease of 180,000; and 3.43 million worked in other economic  sectors, up 610,000 as compared with the end of 1992.    In 1993, there were 11.47 million people seeking jobs in  urban areas throughout the country, and 7.05 million of them  found employment. At the end of 1993, 4.2 million of them were  still unemployed with a rate of unemployment of 2.6 percent.  Among those who found jobs, 3.1 million worked in state-run  units, 2.02 million in urban collectively run economic units,  and 980,000 in various units in other economic sectors. The  number of self-employed laborers totalled 950,000.    Enterprises in the service trades which hire many laborers  flourished while consolidating themselves. There are 200,000  such enterprises which hired 9.15 million laborers. Their total  output value reached 160 billion yuan. They delivered taxes and  profits of 12 billion yuan to the state treasury, and gave jobs  to 1.196 million jobless and surplus laborers.    At the end of 1993, 18,000 employment agencies were set up  in  28 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities under the  direct administration of the central government, of which 15,000  were set up by labor departments.    The labor system reform with labor contracts signed by all  the workers for the firm establishment of labor relations had  developed in an overall manner from the experimental stage. At  the end of 1993, the number of workers in state and collectively  run enterprises in the country who had participated in the labor  system reform had reached 55 million, of whom 31 percent of the  total number of enterprise workers or 35 million were under the  labor contract system. The labor system reform was promoted in  an overall manner in 200 cities and counties throughout China.  The reform of the labor contract system was basically completed  in Jilin Province and in Shenzhen, Zhuzhou, Yancheng, Anyang and  other cities. While promoting the labor system reform, various  localities always attached importance to allocating jobs to  surplus personnel laid off by enterprises. In 1993, 1.25 million  surplus workers found jobs.  <H5>  II. Wage Distribution </H5>   Workers' wages were further raised. In 1993, the total  amount  of wages earned by urban workers throughout the country reached  477 billion yuan, up 21.1 percent over 1992. An average worker  earned 3,236 yuan year, up 19.4 percent over 1992. The actual  rate of growth was 2.8 percent if the factor of inflation was  taken into consideration. An average worker in a state-run unit  earned 3,441 yuan a year, up 19.6 percent over 1992.    With the enterprises changing the way they operated and the  system of wage distribution constantly under reform, 18,000  enterprises and 14 million workers had carried out experiments  in implementing the job-skill wage system at the end of 1993.    As for the macro-control over the labor force and wages, a  flexible wage system was adopted in 30 provinces, autonomous  regions, municipalities under the direct administration of the  central government and cities with provincial-level economic  decision-making authority in the country by the end of 1993. In  addition, the Ministry of Labor also sent a flexible wage  control plan to 11 districts to exercise flexible control over  some ministries and commissions and corporations. As a result,  the state had further strengthened its control over the total  amount of wages to workers. The actual growth rate of the total  amount of workers' wages rose 4.3 percent in 1993, which was  lower than the 13.4 percent rate of growth of the GNP. The  actual average worker's wage rose 2.8 percent, lower than the  10.9 percent growth rate of the social labor productivity. This  conformed with the principle of the "two lower's."  <H5>  III. Social Security </H5>   In 1993, the nation received 46.1 billion yuan of social  insurance funds (funds raised by various sectors themselves not  included), and paid off 41.9 billion yuan to beneficiaries with  a carry-over balance of 28.8 billion yuan (including special  state bonds purchased) of which the state received 44 billion  yuan basic old-age pension funds and paid off 40.8 billion yuan  to old-age pensioners with a carry-over balance of 24.5 billion  yuan.    At the end of 1993, 618 cities and counties in the country  carried out reform in providing basic old-age pensions to 25  million workers who worked for state-run enterprises.    The amount of mutual assistance funds for retirees further  increased. At the end of 1993, 13 provinces, autonomous regions  and municipalities under the direct administration of the  central government had helped raise pension funds. In addition  to the state-owned enterprises which had already been raising  their own pension funds in various cities and counties  throughout the country, 1,927 cities and counties had developed  the program for urban mutual assistance retirement funds, an  increase of 168 over 1992. In the whole country, 590,000  enterprises and 73.36 million workers had participated in the  program to collect mutual assistance retirement funds.  Meanwhile, 3,100 enterprises had participated in the  supplementary program for old-age pension insurance, involving  500,000 people. Over 6,000 enterprises participated in the  old-age pension insurance program in the form of individual  savings with 700,000 participants. Some 1,000 cities and  counties paid pensions through banks or social insurance  organizations.    In China, 11 million people in 500 cities and counties in 19  provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities under the  direct administration of the central government participated in  the industrial injury insurance reform, an increase of 140  cities and counties than in 1992. Some 260,000 workers in 221  cities and counties made contributions to mutual assistance  funds to defray medical expenses for workers' major illnesses;  and 280,000 retirees in 134 cities and counties also made  contributions to mutual assistance funds for their own medical  care.    Coverage of unemployment insurance was further expanded, and  the system gradually improved. By the end of 1993, 79.24 million  workers in 532,000 enterprises participated in the unemployment  insurance program. In 1993, unemployment insurance funds of 1.63  billion yuan were collected, and 930 million yuan were paid for  unemployment, medical expenses during the period of  unemployment, job training and the participation in the  self-relief through production program. The labor departments in  various localities provided unemployment relief funds for 1.03  million people who lost their jobs, playing a positive role in  stabilizing the society.    New progress was made in reforming the childbirth insurance  system. By the end of 1993, the system of childbirth insurance  for woman workers was instituted in 268 cities and counties,  marking an increase of 170 over 1992 and covering 5.5 million  workers.  <H5>  IV. Safe Production </H5>   The situation in safe production was grim in 1993. The  number  of accidents and injuries increased on a large scale. This  merits our attention.    In 1993, 19,798 workers died of industrial injuries in  various enterprises throughout the country, up 18.5 percent over  1992. There were 616 incidents leaving three or more people dead  in each case and causing 3,819 deaths in total. The number of  incidents and deaths in 1993 was 6.2 percent and 3.8 percent  respectively higher than that in 1992. During the incidents in  which workers died of industrial injuries, there were 9,112  mining incidents, leaving 10,883 workers dead. As compared with  1992, the number of incidents and deaths rose by 48 percent and  12.4 percent respectively.    The number of highway incidents remained high in 1993. There  were 242,343 traffic accidents leaving 63,508 people dead and  142,251 people injured and causing direct economic losses of 1  billion yuan.    There were 38,094 fire hazards in the country during 1993,  leaving 2,467 people dead, an increase of 27.4 percent over  1992. The fire hazards caused economic losses of 1.12 billion  yuan (damages caused by forest fire not included), up 62.3  percent over 1992.    There were 3,175 train accidents in 1993, causing economic  losses of 46.781 million yuan, a drop of 9.2 percent over 1992.

There were 16,353  accidents along the railways, leaving 9,989 people dead, an  increase of 10 percent over 1992.    In 1993, enterprises in the shipping industry under the  administration of the Ministry of Communications, freighters of  the local transportation departments and the freighters and  ferry boats in rural areas had 2,008 general accidents, marking  a drop of 18.4 percent and leaving 557 people dead, about the  same level as in 1992. Thirty seven ships sank, a drop of 2.3  percent, and the accidents caused economic losses of 147 million  yuan, an increase of 13.2 percent over 1992.    In 1993, China's civil aviation industry reported three  incidents of the first grade and two incidents of the second  grade in transport flights. It reported two incidents of the  first grade and two incidents of the second grade in general  flights.  <H5>  Development of Vocational Skills </H5>   In 1993, the number of schools for the training of  technicians increased to 4,477, up 85 over 1992. The schools  had a total of 664,000 students (57,000 students in rural areas)  with 171,700 boarding students and 335,000 faculty members.  There were 2,525 job training centers in the country, an  increase of 106 over 1992. New progress was made in training  armymen to do civilian work. In 1993, 276,000 armymen were  trained to do civilian work, an increase of 40.8 percent or  80,000 over 1992. During 1993, the nation hired 340,000  technicians and senior technicians.  <H5>  Arbitration of Labor Disputes and Labor Supervision </H5>   With the continuous reform of the labor system, the system  in handling labor disputes is getting better and better. In  1993, the labor dispute arbitration committees at all levels  handled 12,358 cases involving labor disputes, up 51.6 percent  over 1992. These cases involved 34,794 workers, an increase of  99.8 percent. They also handled 684 cases involving collective  labor disputes, an increase of 24.8 percent over 1992. These  cases involved 19,468 workers, up 113.9 percent over 1992.    The work for labor supervision was further improved. Labor  supervisory organs were set up in 16 provinces, autonomous  regions and municipalities under the direct administration of  the central government and in some regions. A system wherein the  masses might report cases involving illegal labor employment  activities was established. Extensive checkups were carried out  on all forms of labor employment.  <H5>  Social Labor Productivity </H5>   China's GNP totalled 3.138 trillion yuan in 1993, up 13.4  percent over 1992. The social labor productivity in 1993  calculated on the basis of the GNP rose by 10.9 percent over  1992.  Note: The labor force resource was calculated in  accordance  with the new specification.

			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / International Company News: Microsoft in interactive TV race Microsoft, the leading personal computer software company, has pounced on the emerging market for computer systems used to deliver interactive television services with the launch of software code-named 'Tiger'. Microsoft, in collaboration with Compaq Computer and Intel of the US, claims to be able to provide cable television companies and telephone groups with 'media server' systems at a fraction of the cost of interactive television technologies developed by competitors. Systems developed by International Business Machines, Digital Equipment, Hewlett-Packard and Oracle have already been adopted for trials of interactive TV in the US and UK. Media servers are the computers used to store and retrieve digitised video and audio signals for services such as video-on-demand, interactive TV shopping, and interactive TV channel guides. Anticipated business applications of the technology include hotel and airline entertainment systems, video messaging and corporate multimedia networks. While its competitors have developed media servers based on super-computers and mainframe computers, Microsoft's Tiger software can be run on inexpensive microcomputers, the company claims. Video-on-demand services did not necessarily require high-powered computers, said Mr Nathan Myhrvold, Microsoft senior vice-president of advanced technology. 'Once you have the right software, you can implement (video-on-demand) in many ways,' he said. The Tiger software allowed computer systems to be expanded as the needs of the network grew, he added. Yesterday, the companies demonstrated a prototype system based on 16 Intel Pentium microprocessors, capable of delivering more than 3,000 video signals simultaneously. Viewers could choose from more than 50 films, and control the video signals as if they were running on a home video cassette recorder. PC manufacturers are expected to offer Tiger servers for small and medium-sized applications, such as corporate networks, while Intel will offer larger-scale multimedia servers for public networks. Compaq, the leading manufacturer of PC network 'servers', planned to develop media server products, the company said.</p>

			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Bank stresses ERM unease A FURTHER distancing of Britain from early re-entry into the European exchange rate mechanism was signalled yesterday by Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the governor of the Bank of England. Mr Leigh-Pemberton, speaking in New York two months ahead of his retirement, said: 'Exchange-rate stability is the result of convergence in underlying economic policies and performance. It cannot be achieved by actions in the exchange markets alone.' The speech was interpreted as an effort by Mr Leigh-Pemberton, Bank governor for 10 years, to downplay the significance of the ERM as a future plank of UK economic policy. It is likely to irritate many of the UK's European partners, who see sterling's early re-entry into the ERM as vital to economic and monetary union. Although global co-ordination of economic policies was important, Mr Leigh-Pemberton told the Institute of International Bankers that the 'primary international responsibility of each country is to set its own house in order'. Underlining the unease about the ERM shared by many in the UK government since Britain's forced exit last September, he said: 'Attempts to move exchange markets in directions that are not consistent with underlying policies nearly always end in disappointment.' The speech underlines the scepticism shared by some Bank officials that the ERM discipline could ever have been construed as a replacement for tough domestic policies aimed at price stability. Avoiding reference to moves to create a single currency for Europe, the governor said the efforts to establish an economic and monetary union should primarily be to 'remove unnecessary regulations, open markets to competition, and eliminate barriers to trade'.</p>

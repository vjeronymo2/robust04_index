			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: New issues Lombard Insurance has become the second small insurance company to push for a flotation this year, and private investors can subscribe through a 5.15m share intermediaries offer at 160p apiece, writes Simon Davies. The company was bought out last year from Continental Inc and has an indemnity against all claims arising from events before June 1993. It focuses on provincial general insurance business, mainly in personal lines such as private car and household cover at the low-risk end of the market. Lombard reduced the issue price by almost 10 per cent, reflecting the falling stock market, but institutions have still not been battling for the placing shares. Concerns focused on increasing competition in Lombard's sector of the market, compounded by the knock-on effect of falling bond and equity prices on insurers' investment income. In the short term, Lombard offers likely profits growth. And while the shares may give back nothing to the stags, they do appear to offer longer-term value. The offer is sponsored by Charterhouse Bank. Healthcall, the UK's largest provider of duty doctor services, is floating through a placing and intermediaries offer valuing the company at Pounds 58m, writes David Wighton. But the price is at least 10 per cent below initial expectations, reflecting the more difficult conditions in the new issue market. Pitched at 14.9 times last year's earnings from its continuing businesses, the shares have a notional yield of 4.8 per cent. That looks fairly attractive given the group's growth record and the new opportunities being thrown up by the trend towards community-based care. But there are some question marks over the long-term growth prospects of the core business. With 8,300 GP subscribers, Healthcall has almost half the potential duty doctor market, which has generated good growth in recent years. But the government is keen to stem the rising bill for out-of-hours calls, partly by referring more patients to 24-hour health centres. The group has five such centres already, but a major shift away from home visits could require significant capital investment with uncertain returns. Applications must reach broker James Capel by noon on Thursday, with dealings due to start on May 18.</p>

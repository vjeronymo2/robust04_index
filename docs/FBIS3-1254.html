It is equally important to change one's  mentality and act in accordance with the concepts of democracy.  It is important to admit that others too have the capacity to  think like them (members of the Mozambique Liberation Front  [Frelimo]).    Jose Massinga says he has not observed any change in  Frelimo.  "Their heads are still full of communist concepts and they still  think they are the only thinking human beings in this country,"  he said. A clear example of this was observed during the  "multiparty" talks when the Frelimo government showed its usual  arrogance. [passage omitted]    Jose Chicuara Massinga was a Frelimo militant from the first  days of its founding, in 1962, until 1981 when he was arrested  together with a number of officers from the Mozambique Armed  Forces/Popular Forces for the Liberation of Mozambique, accused  of being a CIA agent. Asked to give his version of events,  Massinga denied having at any time spied for the CIA.    After the investigations it was noted that none of the  prisoners had links with South Africa, hence the CIA story was  invented to implicate Dr. Massinga, who had American friends  working in Mozambique.    "They made it a big story, since they controlled all the  news  media, and the system then did not allow a person to defend  himself," he said.    Jose Massinga said: "The inconsistency lies in the fact that  the people who accused me of being a CIA agent survive, along  with their regime, partly because of the money from the United  States, which owns the CIA that `tormented' them. It is,  therefore, correct to ask who the CIA agent is: me or them?"    Massinga said that, after making up this story, Frelimo  confiscated all his property, notably his house, car, and  clothes. He is currently living with his niece, who gave him a  room, while he is waiting for his confiscated property to be  returned.</p>

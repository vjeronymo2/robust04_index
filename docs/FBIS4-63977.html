			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Mikhail Ivanchikov report under the "CIS Deadlocks" rubric: </F> "We Will Divide Up the Fleet and Then Go Off and Vacation in the  Crimea"]    [Text] The Russian-Ukrainian talks in Moscow on the future  of the Black Sea Fleet are still far from over, although there  is a decision in principle now -- it has been resolved to divide  the whole fleet virtually in half, with 169 ships going to the  Russian side and 164 to the Ukrainian side.    However, confusion over the lists -- what should go to whom  -- is delaying a resolution. This essentially simple solution  to the situation -- taking everything and dividing it all up --  brings a wry smile to fleet officers' faces. After such a  division it will scarcely be possible to speak of the Russian  and Ukrainian fleets' possessing even basic combat  effectiveness, because the Black Sea Fleet was created as a  single entity to carry out fully defined tasks. Moreover,  another perfectly natural question arises here: Is Ukraine  capable of maintaining such an enormous structure on its own,  given the republic's very grave economic situation? And even  that is not all. Financial difficulties aside, a whole raft of  other problems arise, particularly cadre problems. It is not  clear how and where the Ukrainian Navy commanders will train the  officer personnel for their own fleet.    But the division of the ships is only part of the solution  to  the problem. The Russian ships will continue to be based in  Sevastopol. Howver, the status of that city has still to be  defined. The Russian side would like everything to remain as it  was, but that does not suit Ukraine. A Russian military base in  Sevastopol is fine; but Sevastopol as a whole as a Russian  military base is not.    The delicate issue of the fate of the Black Sea Fleet is  being decided on this occasion not by the presidents but by the  Russian and Ukrainian heads of government, even though  previously Kravchuk and Yeltsin were dealing with this problem  on their own. The faulty-telephone ploy -- the premiers  themselves are not authorized to make any kind of final decision  without the sanction of their presidents (Chernomyrdin and  Zvyahilskyy are obliged to continually consult their chiefs) --  also drags out the negotiations. It is no secret that relations  between Borya and Lenya (which, according to Boris Nikolayevich,  is how the chiefs of Russia and Ukraine used to address each  other not so long back) have markedly cooled of late. As the  saying goes, friendship is all very well, but money is a serious  matter. And the reason for this was Yeltsin's message to  Kravchuk after the official Ukrainian authorities stated that  they were ready the pay the highest price for Crimea. Boris  Nikolayevich did not beat about the bush: The Ukrainian  authorities should not try to resolve the Crimean issue from a  position of strength. Leonid Makarovich had a ready response:  He stated that the Russian president's message to him was not  in keeping with international norms, which, translated from  diplomatic into colloquial language, means "Keep out of our  business!"    Meanwhile, as many analysts note, inflaming passions over  the  Crimea plays into Kravchuk's hands. The upcoming presidential  election has no attraction for Kravchuk. His only chance of  remaining in the saddle is to postpone or call off the election  altogether. However, that is a high-risk venture as, if he  fails to keep the situation under control, in the eyes of  international opinion he will lose the image of a politician  who, despite everything, was able to avoid the worst-case  scenario and keep Ukraine from collapsing.    Moscow has gladly joined in this game. Both legislators and  representatives of the executive -- literally all of them --  have expressed their opinions on the Crimean events.    Taking their cue from the "battle of the iron chancellors,"  the local "Napoleons" have likewise gotten down to political  business. Thus -- to the annoyance of the current Crimean  authorities -- pro-Ukrainian forces have announced the creation  of a Crimean Rada, that is to say, a parliament. This is the  third legislative authority now in being on the peninsula: A  Crimean Supreme Council and a Crimean Tatars' assembly function  in one way or another.    While the politicians are crossing swords, the people of the  Crimea are worried by something else: What effect will the  current battles have on the vacation season -- after all, the  more vacationers, the greater the takings. It is to be hoped  that the inhabitants of the peninsula will not be the losers in  this situation.</p>

			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Problems left after HK airport deal The imminent agreement between China and Hong Kong on the territory's new airport will be an important symbolic breakthrough, but leaves a number of questions unanswered, according to officials who have followed the talks closely. The outspoken optimism of Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong governor, in London on Wednesday night means there is little likelihood of a last minute snag, but signature of the framework agreement must be followed by specific subsidiary arrangements allowing the project sponsors to raise much-needed debt finance. Mr Patten argued that these subsidiary agreements, which cover the relationship between the Hong Kong government, the Mass Transit Railway and the provisional airport authority would follow automatically. Some officials privately fear, however, that China could turn them into a new set of bargaining chips in discussions over Britain's handover of Hong Kong in 1997. Nor would an airport deal necessarily imply a sudden and significant shift in China's underlying approach to Hong Kong. Mr Patten's offer earlier this month for Hong Kong officials to collaborate with the preliminary working committee, which China has set up to prepare for the handover of power, has met a stony silence from Beijing. It would only become clear in the follow-up to a framework agreement on the airport how far the underlying climate has changed. One view in Hong Kong is that the uncertainties generated by the ill-health of Mr Deng Xiaoping, China's supreme leader, make it difficult for Beijing to undertake any serious policy initiatives. If so, the timing of the airport agreement would mostly reflect the need for China to distance the move from the passage of Mr Patten's democracy legislation through the Legislative Council earlier this year. It has been clear for some time that obstruction of the airport agreement would not lead to additional concessions from the UK. Beijing is also thought to have come under pressure from the business community to settle a dispute which has cast a shadow over the territory's credit rating. Without the delay, debt finance for the project could have been raised when interest rates were lower, Hong Kong officials say. Instead the government has continued to fund construction of the project so that only about HKDollars 23bn (Pounds 1.8bn) of debt finance will now be required. The final ratio of debt to equity will now be about a quarter compared to around half when the project started. But to raise this finance, the project sponsors need the subsidiary agreements which demonstrate to lending banks that they will be repaid out of project revenues after 1997.</p>

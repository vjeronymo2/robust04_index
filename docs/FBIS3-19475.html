The settlement  of Richard von Weizsaecker's succession should not be used for a  change of power, Verheugen said before journalists in Bonn on  Tuesday evening [15 March]. From the SPD leadership's point of  view, a signal for the Bundestag election in October is neither  expected nor desired from the vote of the Federal Assembly.    The SPD is interested in preserving "several options" for a  government formation on the federal level. If the Free  Democrats do not vote for Christian Democratic Union [CDU]  candidate Roman Herzog on 23 May, this will not induce the SPD  to refrain from talks about an alliance after an election  victory.    In the election of the head of state, however, the Free  Democrats have the opportunity to prove their independence,  Verheugen said. If liberal political positions are decisive, it  should not be hard for the Free Democrats to vote for SPD  candidate Johannes Rau if they compare him with Herzog.    According to Verheugen, it is still open when SPD Chairman  Rudolf Scharping will present his "shadow cabinet." This may be  done before, after, or at the election party congress in Halle  in June. The party chairman does not want a debate or private  talks on that. Scharping is not looking for candidates. This  is not the right expression. "I would say that he is sorting  them out," Verheugen said.</p>

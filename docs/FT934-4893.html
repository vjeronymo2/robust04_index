			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / Hint of new deal for foreign capital A senior minister yesterday pleaded with western investors to increase their stake in Russia, promising a much friendlier regime after parliamentary elections this month. Mr Oleg Soskovets, a first deputy prime minister, told a meeting of US business people that Russian industry needed many billions of dollars of foreign capital to modernise itself. The aluminium industry, he said, needed Dollars 6.6bn (Pounds 4.4bn), oil and gas refineries in the far eastern province of Sakhalin alone needed Dollars 10bn, while the list of demands for oil and gas industry equipment stood at Dollars 17.5bn. He said the government would call on the parliament, elected after December 12, to pass legislation creating free economic zones and concessionary agreements, as well as to rescind 'ill-grounded barriers to the activities of foreign companies in Russia'. He said the percentage of wholly foreign-owned companies in the overall number of joint ventures had grown from 19 per cent in 1992 to 40 per cent in 1993 - though the amount of private foreign capital invested remained low, at around Dollars 2bn. Against a background of falling production, foreign-owned enterprises had increased their output of light industrial products and had helped restore oil production. He said foreign investors should be directed to the priorities of oil production, agriculture, high technology and military conversion. Meanwhile, economics ministers, meeting Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the Russian premier, approved a 'tough' budget - with further spending on the energy sector of Rbs1,500bn (Pounds 870m), to be compensated for by raising unspecified revenues of an equivalent amount. The ministers heard that gross domestic product fell 12 per cent in 1993, compared with 20 per cent last year; that inflation had slowed to 15 per cent in November from 21 per cent in October; and that the budget deficit for the year would be 10 per cent of GDP.</p>

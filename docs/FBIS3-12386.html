However, political  sources close to the Yemeni Socialist party [YSP] leadership  stressed that "the party refuses to participate in such a  government." They expressed their confidence that all the other  parties would not join a government that includes the General  People's Congress [GPC] and the Yemeni Reform Grouping [YRG] and  excludes the party, because "it would be a partitionist  government by all standards."    This comes in the context of reports that President 'Ali  'Abdallah Salih wishes to end the present coalition by excluding  the YSP, relying on the parliamentary majority the GPC and YRG  enjoy in the House of Representatives. Especially as former  South Yemen President 'Ali Nasir Muhammad turned down a YSP  offer to head a new government in place of the present  government headed by Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas.    An opposition sources share the view of a high-ranking YSP  official that "anyone can form a secessionist government if he  wants to." But the main current issue is to safeguard unity.

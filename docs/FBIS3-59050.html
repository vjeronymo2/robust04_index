			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Lothar Ruehl report: "NATO Initiative Meets With </F> Resistance"]    [Text] Berlin -- Significant differences in the interests  of the participating states were shown yesterday at a security  policy conference in Berlin. FRG Defense Minister Volker Ruehe  had invited experts from 14 nations to the Spree to develop with  them concrete steps in the NATO initiative Partnership for  Peace. At their summit meeting two weeks ago, the NATO states  had offered close cooperation to all democratic countries of  East and Central Europe -- as a possible preliminary step toward  full membership.    The debate was dominated by the differences between Ukraine  and Russia and the unchanged demand of Poland, Hungary, the  Czech Republic, and Slovakia for speedy admission to NATO.  These states see in this the only alternative to the  development of a new "Russian sphere of interests" and a  possible "threat to political stability" in East Europe.    Ukrainian Deputy and defense expert Serhiy Holovatyy  resolutely rejected the admission of countries west of Ukraine  to NATO. He even rejected the offer by the NATO initiative to  consult the North Atlantic Council in situations threatening  states outside NATO. Both might result in Ukraine's separation  from West Europe, but also from its western neighbors in Central  Europe, and in a new dependence on Russia. However, Ukraine  does not want to find itself in a joint security zone with  Russia, he said.    The security of the country is determined by certain Russian  tendencies and political forces, the Ukrainian politician  stated. He sees the danger that Moscow might support "Russian  separatism in Ukraine" with the objective "of splitting off,"  for example, "the Crimea, the Don basin, and south Ukraine."  However, such a Russian policy also endangers the agreement  between Clinton, Yeltsin, and Kravchuk on the elimination of  nuclear weapons on Ukrainian soil, which has just been  concluded, he said.    However, Russian representative Sergey Karaganov denied that  his country had such intentions or any Russian interest in a new  annexation of Ukraine. He warned against the admission of new  NATO members. This may weaken NATO politically and reduce its  "deterrent power" toward aggressive Russian politicians and the  security of East Europe. Russia, however, needs a strong NATO  as a partner for securing its own democratic reforms and a new  foreign policy orientation to international cooperation with the  West, he said.</p>

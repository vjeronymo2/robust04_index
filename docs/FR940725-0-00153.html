			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (4) Understanding of the physical signs and reactions of exposure to hazards,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Knowledge of the types of personal protective equipment that may be needed for safe entry into and exit from the space, (6) Knowledge of how to use personal protective equipment, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) When necessary, awareness of the presence and proper use of barriers or other devices that may be needed to protect an entrant from hazards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The final rule combines SESAC's proposed paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2) to present all the general topics in which employees should be instructed in one place. Additionally, the SESAC proposal addressed confined spaces only. Because final revised Subpart B covers enclosed spaces and other dangerous atmospheres, as well as confined spaces, OSHA has applied the training requirements to all employees that enter confined and or enclosed spaces or other dangerous atmospheres.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In paragraph (d)(3), OSHA is requiring the employer to ensure that an employee who must enter confined or enclosed spaces or other dangerous atmospheres is trained to exit the space under certain conditions. The specific conditions for which an entrant must be trained to exit include:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Upon order of the employer,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Upon the sounding of an evacuation signal, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Whenever the entrant perceives that there is a danger or threat to his or her safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In paragraph (d)(4), OSHA is requiring employers to ensure that employees who must enter confined or enclosed spaces or other dangerous atmospheres receive their training:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Before they begin work addressed by this section and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Whenever there is a change in operations or in an employee's duties that present a hazard about which the employee has not been trained previously. This provision was not included in SESAC's recommendations on training. Their recommendation specified that ``appropriate training'' be provided to confined space entrants. OSHA believes that it is essential to spell out when the training required under paragraph (d)(1) through (d)(3) must be provided and that employees must receive this instruction before they are exposed to the working conditions and operations covered by the training. To address this issue, the Agency has incorporated language based on &sect;1910.146(g)(2) (i) through (iii) of the generic permit-space standard, so that the final rule ensures that employees will be trained before exposure to the hazards posed by confined or enclosed spaces or other dangerous atmospheres.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In paragraph (d)(5), OSHA is requiring that the employer certify that the training required by paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(4) has been accomplished. The rule also lists the information that must be provided on the certification: the employee's name, the name of the trainer, and the date or dates of the training. Paragraph (d)(5) requires the certification of training to be available for inspection by the Assistant Secretary, the Director of NIOSH, the employees, and their representatives.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A certification requirement was not included in SESAC's recommendations. However, OSHA believes that its inclusion in the final rule is necessary for several reasons. Certification of employee training provides a valuable record to employers who need to be able to keep track of who has been trained. Also, the certification enables employees to determine whether or not the employer has accurately recorded their training. Lastly, the certification facilitates OSHA's enforcement of the standard. Standards on employee training routinely incorporate requirements for the certification of training, and OSHA has found that such requirements ensure that employees are indeed trained in accordance with these standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (e) of final &sect;1915.12 contains requirements for rescue teams.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The rulemaking participants overwhelmingly approved the adoption of the rescue team requirements listed in the notice reopening the record (Ex. 11&hyph;1, 11&hyph;2, 11&hyph;3, 11&hyph;4, 11&hyph;5, 11&hyph;6, 11&hyph;9, 11&hyph;13, 11&hyph;14, 11&hyph;15, 11&hyph;18, 11&hyph;19, 11&hyph;20, 11&hyph;24, 11&hyph;25, 11&hyph;26, 11&hyph;29, 11&hyph;35, 11&hyph;37, 11&hyph;39, 11&hyph;41, 11&hyph;45, 11&hyph;47, 11&hyph;49, 11&hyph;50, 11&hyph;51). These rulemaking participants advocated that the SESAC recommendations be incorporated in their entirety. They stated that training was essential in preventing accidents and in promoting self-rescue.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (e) requires that employers either make provisions for a shipyard rescue team or make an arrangement under which an outside rescue team will respond promptly to a request for rescue service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some commenters urged OSHA to consider addressing the response time of rescue teams (Ex. 11&hyph;10, 11&hyph;28, 11&hyph;30, 11&hyph;51). These commenters realized the difficulty involved in specifying an exact response time; however, they felt that it was important for rescue efforts to begin promptly. For example, Con-Space Communications Ltd. (Ex. 11&hyph;28) stated their recommendations as follows: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> This could be a difficult thing to regulate but, minimum requirements should be set to ensure that trained personnel and equipment are available in the event of an incident. Response time is the hard item to determine. Obviously the faster the better for the person in difficulty, but if OSHA allows outside rescue services to be used, response time would be longer than if the rescue team was in-house.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Response time of an outside rescue service would be totally dependant on its distance from the problem site.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed paragraph 1915.12(f) is a practical solution to a difficult problem. Plant rescue teams should be able to respond more quickly than outside teams but the cost of maintaining an in-plant [shipyard] team could be excessive. We are left with a simple question, ``is the risk of slow response higher than the possible risk to the life of the person waiting for help?''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the outside rescue team receives more calls for help than it can handle, who waits and who gets penalized, the employer or the contracted rescue team or more important_who dies?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

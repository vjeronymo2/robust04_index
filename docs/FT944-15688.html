			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Survey of International Telecommunications (1):  It is time to cut through the hype - Despite the excitement over telecom 'superhighways,' most of the world's population does not yet have access to a basic phone line 'The linking of the world's people to a vast exchange of information and ideas is a dream that technology is set to deliver. It will bring economic progress, strong democracies, better environmental management, improved healthcare and a greater sense of shared stewardship of our small planet.'  - US vice-president Al Gore, writing in the FT last month about his ambitions for a Global Information Infrastructure (GII), based on international fibre-optic telecommunications. It is a noble goal. Mr Gore's vision also sounds plausible, so successful has been the 'superhighways hype' industry. For many FT readers, sitting in offices crammed with phones, PC screens, on-line information services, with a mobile handset in the briefcase, much of it has already been accomplished. But it is time for serious observers to cut the hype and take a sober look at reality. The fact is that technology is not about to 'deliver' the GII, and with it a paradise of universal democracy, peace, greenery and long life. Most of the world's population does not even have access to a basic phone line; and that is the best that technology, plus huge investment, is likely to deliver to even a small minority of people within the foreseeable future. Mr Gore does not pretend otherwise. In 1985, the Maitland Commission noted: 'In most developing countries, the telecommunications system is not adequate even to sustain essential services.' Now, a decade on, networks remain grossly inadequate. Barely a fifth of 105 countries surveyed by the International Telecommunications Union boast more than 25 phone lines per 100 people, with most developing countries providing fewer than 5 per 100 (see charts, overleaf). According to a recent study,* developing countries have 75 per cent of the world's population and 16 per cent of its product, but only 12 per cent of its telephone lines. As for the GII, the typical Spaniard will this year be on the phone to someone abroad for a mere 20 minutes, but that compares with a few seconds for the typical Tanzanian. Telecoms development is critical to economic growth: a study by the International Telecommunications Union plotting gross domestic product per capita against 'teledensity' (telephone lines per 100 people) suggests that for every extra Dollars 1,000 of GDP a country will have an extra 2.24 phone lines per person. The foremost challenge - in telecom terms - for the developing world is the provision of more basic phone lines. The private sector in the developed world - banks, equipment suppliers and operators - is set to play a critical role in meeting it. According to a recent World Bank presentation, about Dollars 55bn a year for the next six years will be required to build up basic networks in developing countries and the former eastern Europe bloc. Whereas in the 1980s barely a fifth of telecoms investment in the developing world came from the private sector, about half of the Dollars 55bn will have to come from that source. In the World Bank's view, the only way to achieve that goal is for governments to embark on radical liberalisation and privatisation programmes. They are starting to do so, albeit in a halting manner. India, which has barely eight telephone lines per 1,000 people, is a classic study of the forces at work. Western operators, eyeing the lucrative opportunities for satisfying unmet demand, have been flooding the Indian government with proposals for franchised networks and competing operations. The country's state telecoms commission gave them strong support, but the government, besieged by trade unions and worried about losing control, dithered about abolition of the state monopoly. Finally, last month the government decided to allow private operators to bid for regional licences to operate networks in competition with the state monopoly - a significant concession, although less than the private groups wanted - but at the same time moved the strongly pro-reform chairman of the telecoms commission to another job. It is a similar story in China, the world's biggest telecoms growth market, where the country's ministry of posts and telecommunications (MPT) has fought tooth and nail against any weakening of its position. The MPT this year lost the battle to prevent other state ministries setting up their own telecoms division, and it is set to face further deregulation of the market as Beijing seeks to attract foreign capital to help meet its target of increasing China's number of phone lines from the present 30m to 110m by 2000. Only in the developed world are 'superhighways' - the upgrading of telecom networks to take fibre-optic cables to the kerb or even into the home - an immediate concern. Most of the main operators have built trunk fibre networks and are starting to extend fibre into the local loop; they are also at various stages in trials of inter-active business and residential services, from networked personal computers to home shopping and video-on-demand. Again, a dose of caution is needed. Very few inter-active services are currently available. Most national networks are not yet up to it; and where they are, the pricing of services such as video-on-demand is highly problematic, particularly where existing alternatives - in that case renting videos from the local store - are cheap and well-established. The 'global village' is similarly inhibited by high cross-border telecoms rates. Sustained by the cartel of national operators which fixes the tariffs, international telecoms prices remain far higher than costs. The cartel is beginning to crumble in the face of liberalisation, the rise of new forms of competition, and the formation of global alliances of large telecoms operators aiming to offer 'one-stop' services to multinationals. But until cross-border prices come down to the level of national tariffs, Mr Gore's GII will encompass a fairly select band. One of the most effective remedies for monopoly pricing is, of course, to abolish the monopoly. Across the developed world monopolies are in the process of being abolished. The UK, Sweden and New Zealand now have almost unrestrained telecoms competition: new operators are able to gain licences quickly and they are allowed to build their own infrastructure. Elsewhere, liberalisation is proving a fraught endeavour, although the trend is unambiguous. In the US, Congress failed this year to reform the country's antiquated telecoms laws. The proposed legislation would have broken down the barriers between 'local' and 'long-distance' networks, extending competition in one step and avoiding the heavy litigation which looks set to continue to be the prime vehicle for reshaping the US regulatory maze. In Europe, where monopoly remains the rule for basic voice traffic, an orderly march to full competition is in progress. The EU's 12 members have agreed to allow full competition in voice services by January 1998, and are close to agreeing to open up infrastructure within a similar timescale. Across most of the developed world, competition is already entrenched in the fast-growing mobile communications sector, with the cellular phone on the threshold of becoming a mass consumer good. As it does so, operators are increasingly focusing on the potential for radio systems to replace 'fixed' networks in the local loop. Such 'fixed cellular' systems are set to provide low-cost local networks, dramatically cutting the investment required to provide networks in competition with those of existing fixed-wire operators and offering new prospects for telecoms growth in the developing world. Some believe that in the developed world the prospect of serious competition with radio operators for voice telephony traffic will drive existing fixed-wire operators to develop superhighway services fast, since the greater bandwidth of fibre-optics will provide their main competitive edge over radio. Mr Jozef Cornu, technical director at Alcatel, the French equipment supplier, says: 'In the battle between operators, those that go via radio will lack bandwidth, so those with fixed networks will be obliged to develop multimedia services.' It is a plausible scenario, and further support for the 'Negraponte switch'  -the notion developed by Mr Nicholas Negraponte, director of the media laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, that services traditionally delivered by radio are set to switch to cable and vice versa. But once again, it does not describe the telecoms world this year or next. *RJ Saunders, JJ Warford, B Wellenius, 'Telecommunications and Economic Development,' (second edition), Johns Hopkins University Press.  ----------------------------------------------------------       THE INFORMATION RICH AND THE INFORMATION POOR  ---------------------------------------------------------- Minutes of outgoing International Telephone Traffic (MITT)         per inhabitant in selected countries, 1991  ---------------------------------------------------------- OECD  ---------------------------------------------------------- Luxembourg                                   423.7 Switzerland                                  209.2 Belgium                                       82.3 Austria                                       81.5  ---------------------------------------------------------- OECD Average                                  21.1  ---------------------------------------------------------- Spain                                         18.4 Portugal                                      14.1 Japan                                          9.4 Turkey                                         3.4  ---------------------------------------------------------- WORLD  Mitt per inhabitant per year            7.3  ---------------------------------------------------------- AFRICA  ---------------------------------------------------------- Botswana                                      17.7 Swaziland                                     14.4 Lesotho                                       11.1 Djibouti                                      10.0  ---------------------------------------------------------- AFRICA Average                                 1.6  ---------------------------------------------------------- Sierra Leone                                   0.3 Burkina Faso                                   0.2 Ethiopia                                       0.2 Tanzania                                       0.1  ---------------------------------------------------------- WORLD Mitt per inhabitant per year             7.3  ---------------------------------------------------------- Source: ITU Telecom Indicator Database  ----------------------------------------------------------</p>

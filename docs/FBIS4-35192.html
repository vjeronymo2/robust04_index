			<p>BFN     [Text] Tunis, 28 May (MENA) -- Dr. Hanan 'Ashrawi, former  spokeswoman of the Palestinian negotiating delegation, has  stressed that she will not join the Palestinian National  Authority Council, which will administer self-rule in Gaza and  Jericho.    In remarks to the MENA correspondent in Tunis, Dr. 'Ashrawi  said that she will not accept any position in the National  Authority, although Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat has  picked her up to be a member of the Council and offered her the  information portfolio. She explained that this is because she  has obligations to an independent Palestinian body working for  Palestinian citizens' rights, which chose her to be its chairman.    Dr. 'Ashrawi pointed out that despite her refusal to join  the  Council, she attended meetings held by the Council in the past  two days because she had been invited to them. She also wanted  to participate in drafting the Palestinian National Authority's  program so that it would be adequate, comprehensive, democratic,  just, and allow for accountability to and revision by the  legislative bodies, she added. She hoped that all articles of  the Palestinian National Authority's program would be  implemented and adhered to by every one.</p>

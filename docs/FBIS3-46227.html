But, the assembly hall of the provincial  guesthouse is as warm as spring. On 14 December, the provincial  party committee and the provincial government held a meeting to  commend a group of outstanding specialists, scholars, and  technicians with contributions to building and rejuvenating  Jilin and to present medals of Jilin's outstanding talents to  them.    The meeting was chaired by Wang Jinshan.    Present at the meeting were He Zhukang, Gao Yan, Liu  Yunzhao,  Su Rong, Feng Ximing, Wang Yunkun, Liu Yazhi, Xu Zhongtian, and  Ke Muyun.    At the meeting, Governor Gao Yan read the provincial party  committee and government's decision on issuing medals of Jilin's  outstanding talents to 1,895 specialists, scholars, and  technicians, including Tang Aoqing. [passage omitted]    He Zhukang, secretary of the provincial party committee,  made  a speech at the meeting. He said: Today, the provincial party  committee and the provincial government ceremoniously held a  meeting to present "medals of Jilin's outstanding talents" to  1,895 specialists, scholars, and technicians with outstanding  contributions to Jilin's modernization and to carry forward  their deeds. This is a great matter of our province. Over the  past years, the provincial party committee and the provincial  government have constantly put the work toward intellectuals on  the important work agenda and successively worked out and  implemented a series of policies and measures. To live up the  expectations of the party and the people, the broad masses of  intellectuals, with vast branches of learning, boundless wisdom,  high enthusiasm, and the spirit of fearing no difficulties,  keeping forging ahead, and waging an struggle, have engaged  themselves in the great practice of reform, opening up, and  modernization; brought their wisdom and intelligence into full  play; and made brilliant achievements. Some of the medal  winners present here today made prominent contributions to  building the revolutionary base earlier before the liberation  war. Some of them gave up their good working and living  conditions abroad and resolutely returned home to engage  themselves in the construction of new China and to make  contributions to the motherland. Most of them are outstanding  talents who grew up after liberation. They have made arduous  efforts at different posts and handed in satisfactory  examination papers to the party and the people.    He urged: The party committees and governments at various  levels should try every possible means to eliminate difficulties  for the intellectuals, provide them with good environments and  conditions, positively widen the channels to establish contacts  between scientific research units and economic units, offer a  vast environment where science professionals and technicians are  able to bring their skills into play, and ensure the supply of  necessary funds for teaching and scientific research. We should  positively improve the living and medical care conditions of  intellectuals. The leaders at various levels should make friends  with intellectuals, conscientiously listen to their opinions on  the work in various aspects, and provide them with convenience  in understanding the overall situation and engaging in social  practice.    He urged: The vast number of intellectuals should  scientifically grasp the Marxist world outlook and methodology;  engage in scientific research and theoretical explorations along  with an accurate orientation; carry forward the Chinese  intellectuals' fine traditions of being concerned about the  country and the people, making unremitting efforts to improve  themselves, and making selfless sacrifice; go deep to the  reality, the peasants, and the workers; attach primary  importance to the benefits of the motherland and the people; and  contribute their energy and wisdom to seeking benefits for the  motherland and the people.    He urged: The medal winners will guard against arrogance and  rashness, make ceaseless efforts, make new contributions to  building a developed border near-the-sea province, and  rejuvenating Jilin's economy.</p>

			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / International Company News: Prima creditors meet again today SOME 60 creditor banks of the big Spanish property group Prima Inmobilaria are to meet again in Madrid today after a first meeting with Prima and its owners, the Kuwait Investment Office (KIO), to discuss a two-month moratorium on debt repayments, ended in confusion on Wednesday. Prima, the KIO and Salomon Brothers, which is advising the KIO on the restructuring of its Dollars 4bn assets in Spain, are en-couraging the banks  -which Prima owes close to Dollars 500m - to form a steering committee. In return, the KIO has promised to lend Prima Dollars 35m to make interest payments. At Wednesday's meeting, Mr John Gomez-Hall, Prima's chairman, and Mr David Jarvis, the Salomon official advising KIO, said 90 per cent of Prima's assets were either greenfield or under construction and were not producing revenue. The group needed time to design a survival plan. Mr Mahmoud Al-Nouri, the chief KIO official in Spain, unexpectedly spoke. He said the KIO management in London had only been in place since May, implying they were not responsible for the plight of Prima and Ercros, the KIO chemicals group which stopped paying creditors last month. He asked for unanimous agreement on a moratorium or the KIO would have to take other steps. This may have meant suspending payments or the sale of assets. By late yesterday the banks had still not discussed their response.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava May 2 (CTK) -- Central Europe has long  been burdened by the state of Slovak-Hungarian relations which  are even perceived as an obstacle on its road towards the  European Union and NATO, Democratic Left Party (SDL) Chairman  Peter Weiss told CTK on Sunday.    Relations between Bratislava and Budapest have been  characterised thus far by Slovakia's apprehensions concerning  the unwillingness of Budapest to endorse the current  Slovak-Hungarian borders officially in the as yet non-existent  treaty between the two countries. Hungary's complaints about the  position of the Hungarian ethnic minority in Slovakia, a dispute  over the Gabcikovo hydroproject on the Danube and minor  controversies over the unwillingness of Hungary to conclude a  readmission agreement or open new border crossings are among  other disputed issues, Weiss said.    "However, the problems between Hungary and Slovakia are not  as dramatic as they are sometimes made out to be. We do not see  the situation as a conflict," Weiss said. He accused the former  Slovak Government of ex-Premier Vladimir Meciar and the current  Hungarian cabinet of attempting to win points in the internal  political scene "by excessively dramatising Hungarian-Slovak  problems and putting the blame on each other."    "If the French and the Germans have managed to reconcile,  then Hungarians and Slovaks can also come to terms," he said.  Weiss pointed to the fact that the SDL and the Hungarian  Socialist Party of Gyula Horn, a favourite of the forthcoming  Hungarian elections, are ready to conclude a basic inter-state  treaty guaranteeing the inviolability of the common border and  rights to ethnic minorities in both countries.    Weiss stressed, however, that his will to historic  reconciliation with Budapest has its limits -- all speculations  about territorial autonomy for the Hungarian ethnic minority in  Slovakia are unacceptable to us since they simply will not pass  in Slovakia.    Regarding Slovakia's relations with the Czech Republic,  Weiss  said they required primarily a matter-of-fact approach. Weiss,  who is considered a possible candidate for Slovak future  premier, further said:    "We consider relations with the Czech Republic to be of a  key  importance. We want to proceed from all the positive steps  achieved during the 74 years of our co-existence. Naturally the  two countries are currently independent and have their own  interests which they want to protect. But these interests  should be pursued and protected on the basis of an expert and a  matter-of-fact dialogue."</p>

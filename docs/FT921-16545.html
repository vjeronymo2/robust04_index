			<p>920102 FT  02 JAN 92 / Laister may quit as head of MCC MR PETER LAISTER said last night he was considering resigning as chairman of Maxwell Communication Corporation following High Court approval on Tuesday of an arrangement covering the company's administration in the US that removes the MCC board's powers. The arrangement between the UK administrators and the US examiner, appointed by the New York bankruptcy court, was designed to harmonise insolvency proceedings against MCC and avoid conflicts of jurisdiction. If the New York bankruptcy court approves the arrangement on Friday, as is likely, Price Waterhouse as UK administrators will be effectively recognised by the US court as 'debtor in possession'. MCC board members will then lose the power to reconstruct the company under Chapter 11 bankruptcy law and will leave Mr Laister with no executive role either in the US or the UK where MCC is in administration. 'I have done what I became chairman to do, apart from the matter of MCC pensioners,' Mr Laister said, adding that the placing of MCC in the US in Chapter 11 was a necessary step. He said he was concerned that any reconstruction would ensure MCC's UK pension funds were adequately refinanced. Some Pounds 73m of the Pounds 95m in UK pension funds appears to have been taken and only about one third of assets currently needed were actually in place, he said. Mr Laister took over as chairman of MCC on December 3, following Mr Kevin Maxwell's resignation in order to avoid conflicts of interest. He had a frosty relationship with Price Waterhouse. He surprised MCC's bankers and Price Waterhouse by applying for Chapter 11 protection from creditors in the US where 80 per cent of MCC's assets are held. He then criticised a Price Waterhouse report to bankers detailing the losses at MCC which alleged 'extensive misfeasance' among senior executives as 'a shoddy piece of work'. The eclipse of the MCC board by the transatlantic co-operation between bankruptcy officials should now allow an orderly wind-down of the MCC empire. In its application to the High Court, Price Waterhouse specifically called for Mr David Shaffer to remain as American chief executive of MCC because of his detailed knowledge of Macmillan and Official Airlines Guide, two of the largest assets.

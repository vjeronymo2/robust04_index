			<p>BFN     [Text] Taipei, June 21 (CNA) -- A visit to the United  States by Republic of China [ROC] President Li Teng-hui would be  beneficial for both countries, Raymond Tai, deputy  secretary-general to Li, said Tuesday [21 June].    At a regular press conference at the presidential office,  Tai  said that Li would be glad to accept the invitation to visit the  United States extended to him by U.S. Senator Frank Murkowski  (R-Alaska) and Hank Brown (R-Colorado), but that his willingness  to visit could not by itself guarantee that a visit will come  off, given that the invitation did not come from the Clinton  administration itself.    However, a Li visit to the United States would be good for  the economic and trade relationship and cultural interflow  between the two countries, Tai noted.    Taiwan is the sixth-largest trading partner of the United  States and along with the United States is a member of the  Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum, Tai said. He quoted Li  as saying that if given the chance, he would also visit Britain,  France, Germany, or any place a visit would benefit Taiwan.</p>

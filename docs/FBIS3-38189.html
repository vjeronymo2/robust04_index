With this  observation, European Investment Bank (EIB) President Brian  Unwin reaffirmed yesterday, during the presentation of the  financial institution of the European Union [EU], that the  funding of large-scale EU projects depends more on the  availability of "good projects," than on the availability of  funds.  <H5>  Organization Participating in European Development </H5>   This is one way to justify the fact that, despite a  15-percent increase in new loans (reaching ECU19.6 billion or  approximately 130 billion French francs), the EIB contributed  only 12 percent of this amount to the European Growth  Initiative, which was decided during the Edinburgh summit in  December 1992 and further extended by subsequent summits.  Actually, the EIB could use only one-fourth of the amount  initially provided for under this "Edinburgh" financial scheme,  and the European Investment Fund, which was also approved in  late 1992 with a view to supporting the Community's economic  recovery, has not yet seen the light of day.    However, through its "normal" activities, the EIB  contributes  to European economic development by adhering to priorities  defined by the European Commission, whereby each of its loans is  subject to a favorable recommendation by the Commission. Last  year, its loans represented 2 percent of the overall investment  effort within the EU (GFCF or gross fixed capital formation).  The EIB's average financing level reached 30 percent of project  cost, while the beneficiary projects constituted 5 percent of  European GFCF. This percentage is markedly higher in the EU's  four poorest countries (Portugal: 22 percent; Greece: 15  percent; Spain and Ireland: 14 percent), which receive more than  one-third of all EIB loans.    "Could we have done more?" asked Brian Unwin, immediately  adding: "Yes, but we cannot invent good projects." The upper  ceiling of outstanding EIB debts and guarantees is limited by  statute to ECU144 billion. On 31 December 1993, only 68 percent  of this amount was used. But "projects must be justifiable on  economic and environmental grounds, and they have to be  technically and financially viable," emphasized the EIB  president, adding that "the quality of the (EIB's) portfolio is  essential to its reputation as a borrower on the capital  markets." Thanks to its "triple A" rating, the EIB enjoys the  best possible borrowing conditions.    The EIB's means of action will be increased "in the coming  weeks" with the establishment of the European Investment Fund,  which was delayed one year because of the slowness by member  states in passing the necessary amendments to the EIB statutes  ratified by their national parliaments.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Main Beneficiaries of EIB Loans (in million ECU)                             |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Country                  |Loan Amount              |including "Edinburgh" Fu-|  |                         |                         |nding                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Germany                  |2,096.6                  |287.8                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Spain                    |4,005.1                  |344.4                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |France                   |2,205.5                  |300.0                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Italy                    |3,362.0                  |446.1                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Portugal                 |1,488.8                  |186.2                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Britain                  |1,929.1                  |300.0                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |EIB loans totaled ECU19.6 billion in 1993, 90 percent of which was destined  |  |to EU member countries.

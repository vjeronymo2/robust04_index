			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Every allegation was 'carefully examined' SIR Nicholas Lyell, attorney-general, yesterday agreed to publish correspondence between him and Mr Michael Mates, former Northern Ireland secretary, over the Asil Nadir case. But in a Commons statement he rejected Mr Mates's call for an independent inquiry. He said a trial for Mr Nadir was still fixed for October 4. Sir Nicholas told MPs that it was 'perfectly proper' for an MP to make representations to him 'about any anxieties they may have concerning the conduct of a prosecution'. Between September 1991 and May 10, 1993, Mr Mates made representations 'on a number of occasions both in writing and orally on which occasions the meetings were carefully noted by an official'. Each allegation and concern raised by Mr Mates 'I caused to be carefully examined with the appropriate authority or body and following which I wrote back to him in some detail.' He told the Commons he was 'intensely conscious' of the need to keep separate the roles of parliament and the political process, and that of the judiciary, and it was only because of 'the exceptional circumstances' that he had asked for the discretion of the speaker to enable him to deal with Mr Mates's points. He summarised the issues raised by Mr Mates, saying: 'He has accused the Serious Fraud Office of improperly seeking to harass and prejudice the defendant by allegedly tipping off the media as to the times and places of arrests and other aspects of the investigation; of refusing to give proper consideration to a report prepared by the accountants Binder Hamlyn for the defence and failing to make proper inquiries in northern Cyprus; of improperly opening privileged documents; of the allegedly improper seizure by the trustee in bankruptcy of Asil Nadir's papers and certain personal effects; and of improper pressures allegedly brought by the SFO on the judge.' Sir Nicholas said claims of improper press briefing had all been 'carefully investigated' adding: 'None was accompanied by any tangible or verifiable evidence' from Mr Mates. 'On the initial occasion involving the fall of the Polly Peck share price the press were not even present until after that fall and until the raid had been in progress for some considerable time.' It was 'correct that two bags containing some privileged documents were opened in error by police officers'. But they were not copied and were returned after the issue of privilege had been determined by an independent silk. 'The papers and effects seized by the trustee in bankruptcy were also seized pursuant to an order of the court.' Sir Nicholas went on: 'The report of Binder Hamlyn is part of the defence case. The SFO has had no opportunity to scrutinise the supporting documents. Assertions that their removal to this country would contravene local Cypriot law have been refuted by independent Cypriot legal advice. 'The SFO has been unable to obtain permission for its officers to investigate the case in northern Cyprus since each informal application had been met by the response that approaches must be through diplomatic channels which the House will appreciate do not exist in the absence of formal recognition of Turkish republic of northern Cyprus.' 'The alleged conspiracy to bribe the judge is the subject of a separate police investigation under the supervision not of the SFO but of the director of public prosecutions. I do not propose to say more about it since it has been dealt with in court either in camera or subject to reporting restrictions.' Apart from publicity surrounding the arrests, he said, all these matters related essentially to the court proceedings. 'I am of the clear view that it is mistaken and wholly inimical to our system of justice to set up a so-called independent inquiry into the handling of such matters in parallel to a trial,' he said. On the letters, Sir Nicholas said he had previously resisted publication. 'Inevitably they deal with a number of issues which have or may be raised in the preparatory hearings or the trial which could therefore run the risk of confusing the issues or from certain view points reflecting adversely on the defendant.'</p>

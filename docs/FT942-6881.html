			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / International Company News: Minolta Camera back in black at Y258m Minolta Camera, the Japanese camera and precision instrument manufacturer, returned to the black for the year to March 31, thanks to cost cutting and an increase in dividends from subsid-iaries. The company posted unconsolidated pre-tax profits of Y258m (Dollars 2m), compared to a loss of Y13.6bn the previous year. Sales fell 6.1 per cent to Y184.3bn, with falling domestic demand due to the prolonged recession and the appreciation of the yen. After-tax profits were Y530m. Sales at Minolta's office automation machinery division fell 10 per cent to Y115.7bn, but camera sales rose 6.4 per cent to Y68.6bn. Overall exports declined 5.8 per cent to Y141.6bn due to the higher yen. The company said it would forego a dividend payment, as in the previous year, and retain profits for its financial restructuring. For the current year, the company forecasts a rise in parent pre-tax earnings to Y1bn, on a 2.7 per cent rise in sales to Y189bn. Minolta Camera will change its name to Minolta Co from July 1, Reuter reports from Tokyo. The change would more correctly reflect the company's current activities, Minolta said. Minolta was founded in 1937 as a camera maker but has diversified widely into information equipment. Its Japanese name would be changed to Minoruta Kabushiki Kaisha from Minoruta Kamera Kabushiki Kaisha.</p>

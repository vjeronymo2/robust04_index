On November 12, 1993, and on March 9, 1994, Texas submitted SIP revision requests to the EPA to satisfy the requirements of sections 182(b)(4) and 182(c)(3) of the Clean Air Act as amended in 1990 (CAA), 42 U.S.C. 7511a(b)(4) and 7511a(c)(3) and Federal I/M rule 40 CFR Part 51 subpart S. These SIP revisions will require vehicle owners to comply with the Texas I/M program in the four Texas ozone nonattainment areas classified as moderate or worse which includes El Paso also classified as nonattainment area for carbon monoxide. This revision applies to the Texas counties of Brazoria, Chambers, Collin, Dallas, Denton, El Paso, Fort Bend, Galveston, Harris, Jefferson, Liberty, Montgomery, Orange, Tarrant, and Waller. On May 18, 1994 (59 FR 25867), the EPA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPR) for the State of Texas. The NPR proposed approval of the Texas I/M SIP submitted by the State. No public comments were received on the NPR; therefore, the EPA is publishing this final action. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  This rule will become effective on September 21, 1994.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Copies of the State's submittals and the EPA's technical support document (TSD) are available for public review at U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Region 6, (6T&hyph;AP), 1445 Ross Avenue, Suite 700, Dallas, Texas 75202&hyph;2733.

Section 182(a)(2)(B) required any ozone nonattainment area which has been classified as ``marginal'' (pursuant to section 181(a) of the CAA) or worse with an existing I/M program that was part of a SIP, or any area that was required by the 1977 Amendments to the CAA to have an I/M program, to immediately submit a SIP revision to bring the program up to the level required in past EPA guidance or to what had been committed to previously in the SIP, whichever was more stringent. All carbon monoxide nonattainment areas were also subject to this requirement to improve existing or previously required programs to this level.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, all ozone nonattainment areas classified as moderate or worse must implement a basic or an enhanced I/M program depending upon its classification, regardless of previous requirements. In addition, Congress directed the EPA in section 182(a)(2)(B) to publish updated guidance for State I/M programs, taking into consideration findings of the Administrator's audits and investigations of these programs. The States were to incorporate this guidance into the SIP for all areas required by the CAA to have an I/M program. Ozone nonattainment areas classified as ``serious'' or worse with populations of 200,000 or more, and CO nonattainment areas with design values above 12.7 parts per million (ppm.) and populations of 200,000 or more, and metropolitan statistical areas with populations of 100,000 or more in the northeast ozone transport region were required to meet EPA guidance for enhanced I/M programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA has designated four areas as ozone nonattainment in the State of Texas. The Houston/Galveston ozone nonattainment area is classified as severe and contains the following eight counties: Brazoria, Chambers, Fort Bend, Galveston, Harris, Liberty, Montgomery, and Waller. The Beaumont/Port Arthur ozone nonattainment area is classified as serious and contains the following three counties: Hardin, Jefferson, and Orange. The 1980 population of the Beaumont/Port Arthur area was less than 200,000. The El Paso ozone nonattainment area is classified as serious and contains the county of El Paso. The Dallas/Fort Worth ozone nonattainment area is classified as moderate and contains the following four counties: Collin, Dallas, Denton, and Tarrant. The designations for ozone were published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (FR) on November 6, 1991, and November 30, 1992, and have been codified in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). See 56 FR 56694 (November 6, 1991) and 57 FR 56762 (November 30, 1992), codified at 40 CFR sections 81.300&hyph;81.437. In addition, a segment of El Paso Texas has been designated nonattainment for carbon monoxide (CO) and classified as moderate with a design value below 12.7 ppm., under sections 107(d)(4)(A) and 186(a) of the CAA. See 56 FR 56694 (November 6, 1991) and 57 FR 13498 and 13529 (April 16, 1992). Based on these nonattainment designations and populations, basic I/M programs are required in the Beaumont/Port Arthur and Dallas/Fort Worth urbanized areas, while enhanced I/M programs are required in the El Paso and Houston/Galveston urbanized areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Response to Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On May 18, 1994 (59 FR 25867), the EPA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPR) for the State of Texas.

The EPA has reviewed the State submittal against the statutory requirements and for consistency with the EPA regulations and finds it to be acceptable.

Background and Purpose <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Introduction <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As required under title V of the Clean Air Act as amended in 1990 (``the Act''), the EPA has promulgated rules which define the minimum elements of an approvable State operating permits program and the corresponding standards and procedures by which the EPA will approve, oversee, and withdraw approval of State operating permits programs (see 57 FR 32250 (July 21, 1992)). These rules are codified at 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) part 70. Title V requires States to develop, and submit to the EPA, programs for issuing these operating permits to all major stationary sources and to certain other sources, with the exception of sources on Indian Lands. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Act requires that States develop and submit these programs to the EPA by November 15, 1993, and that the EPA act to approve or disapprove each program within one year after receiving the submittal. The EPA's program review occurs pursuant to section 502 of the Act and the part 70 regulations which together outline criteria for approval or disapproval. Where a program substantially, but not fully, meets the requirements of 40 CFR part 70, the EPA may grant the program interim approval for a period of up to two years. If the EPA has not fully approved a program by two years after the November 15, 1993, date, or by the end of an interim program, it must establish and implement a Federal program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Proposed Action and Implications <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Analysis of State Submission <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Support Materials <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to section 502(d) of the Act, the Governor of each State is required to develop and submit to the Administrator an operating permit program under State or local law or under an interstate compact meeting the requirements of title V of the Act. The Arkansas submittal was made under the signature of Governor Jim Guy Tucker in a letter to Acting Regional Administrator, Joe Winkle, EPA, Region 6, dated October 29, 1993. The program will be implemented in all areas of the State of Arkansas. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The State provided a general overview under Tab 1 of the submittal. This overview meets the requirements of 40 CFR 70.4(b)(1) by describing the State program in general terms. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to 40 CFR 70.4(b)(3), the Governor is required to submit a legal opinion from the attorney general (or the attorney for the State air pollution control agency that has independent legal counsel) demonstrating adequate authority to carry out all aspects of a title V operating permit program. The Attorney General's (AG) Opinion appears under Tab 3 of the submittal. The Opinion is signed by the Chief of the Legal Division, ADPCE, certifying full authority to represent the State in all matters relating to the Department's environmental programs. This opinion adequately addresses the thirteen provisions listed at 40 CFR 70.4(b)(3)(i)-(xiii).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 40 CFR 70.4(b)(4) requires the submission of relevant permitting program documentation not contained in the regulations, such as permit forms and relevant guidance to assist in the State's implementation of its permit program. The State provides relevant program documentation under Tab 4 of the submittal. This documentation includes a complete application form, permit form, and a guidance document. The submittal did not contain a model reporting form for the permitted facilities to report emissions to the regulatory authority. However, Arkansas Regulation 26.7(a) references the Federal reporting requirements at 40 CFR 70.6(a)(3). These provisions must be included or formally incorporated by reference. All sources subject to monitoring requirements must submit monitoring reports every six months and must promptly report any deviation from permit requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the ADPCE operating permits program submittal, the ADPCE does not assert jurisdiction over Indian Lands or reservations. To date, no Indian Lands have been identified in the State of Arkansas. Title V sources located on Indian Lands in Arkansas will be subject to the Federal operating permits program, to be promulgated at 40 CFR part 71, or subject to the operating permits program of any Tribe delegated authority for treatment as a State under regulations being developed pursuant to section 301(d) of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Regulations and Program Implementation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The State submitted under Tab 2, Regulation 26, ``Regulations of the Arkansas Operating Permit Program,'' as required at 40 CFR 70.4(b)(2). Regulation 26 follows the rule at 40 CFR part 70 very closely. Supporting documentation of procedurally correct adoption and copies of all applicable State statutes and regulations which authorize the part 70 program, including those governing State administrative procedures, were submitted with the State's program. Regulation 26 received written comments from March 25 through April 24, 1993, and a public hearing was held April 14, 1993. The response to comments was made by ADPCE on July 28, 1993. Sufficient evidence of their procedurally correct adoption was submitted and meets the requirements of 40 CFR 70.4(b)(2). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The following requirements, set out in the EPA's part 70 regulation are addressed in the State's submittal: (a) Provisions to determine applicability (40 CFR 70.3(a)), Regulation 26.3; (b) provisions to determine complete applications (40 CFR 70.5(a)(2)), Regulation 26.4; (c) public participation (40 CFR 70.7(h)), Regulation 26.6; (d) provisions for minor permit modifications (40 CFR 70.7(e)(2)), Regulation 26.10(b); (e) provisions for permit content (40 CFR 70.6(a)), Regulation 26.7; (f) provisions for operational flexibility (40 CFR 70.4(b)(12)), Regulation 26.8; (g) enforcement provisions (40 CFR 70.4(b)(5) and 70.4(b)(4)(ii)), the AG Opinion and Tab 5 of the submittal, Compliance Tracking and Enforcement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Following is a discussion of certain specific provisions in the State's submission as they relate to requirements of 40 CFR part 70: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Applicability criteria, including any criteria used to determine insignificant activities or emissions levels (40 CFR 70.4(b)(2) and 70.3(a)): Applicability criteria are defined at Regulation 26.3. Regulation 26.3(a)(3) specifies that new construction or modification at a part 70 source requires a new or modified part 70 permit before construction begins. However, the State regulation does not require that a source must first undergo a preconstruction permit review as outlined in Section 108, prevention of significant deterioration (PSD) supplement to the Arkansas SIP. The SIP has been submitted for recodification, with the PSD provisions at Regulation 19.9, and has not yet been acted on by the EPA. Regulation 26.3 must be amended to incorporate by reference the applicable PSD requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Insignificant activities are addressed at Regulation 26.3(d) which refers to the SIP at Regulation 19.4(c). The SIP lists the following emissions for which a permit is not required: 1) comfort heating, cooling, and ventilation equipment; 2) portable internal combustion engines used in conjunction with temporary construction operations, or emergency standby generators; or 3) natural gas and oil exploration and production site equipment. An exemption may be obtained for these activities provided that operation of the equipment does not affect any provision of the Federal Clean Air Act and does not contribute to an exceedance of a National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS). No other federally regulated emissions are allowed an exemption under Regulation 26. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Provisions to determine complete applications are listed at Regulation 26.4. The State references the required provisions for a complete application listed at 40 CFR 70.5(c). In order to receive full approval, the State must formally incorporate these provisions by reference or list them specifically in the regulation. Recommended language for formal incorporation by reference would read: ``The Department hereby adopts and incorporates by reference those provisions of 40 CFR 70.5(c), as in effect on July 21, 1992.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Complete application forms, model permit, and instructions are located under Tab 4 of the submittal. These application forms may be amended without rulemaking to facilitate changes required by new applicable requirements. These provisions meet the requirements of 40 CFR 70.5(a)(2). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Provisions for adequate public participation are found at Regulation 26.6. The State regulation provides for adequate public participation and notice to affected States for permit issuance, renewals, and reopenings. These provisions meet the requirements of 40 CFR 70.7(h).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) The rule at 40 CFR 70.7(e)(2) specifies criteria for minor permit modifications that are incorporated in the State regulations at Regulation 26.10(b). The rule at 40 CFR 70.7(e)(2)(i)(A)(5) and Regulation 26.10(b)(7) prohibits changes which constitute modifications under any provision of title I of the Act from being processed as a minor modification. ``Title I modifications'' in Arkansas, are determined by the permitting procedures federally approved into the Arkansas Plan of Implementation for Air Pollution Control (SIP). The SIP, Regulation 19.2, defines any increase in emissions as a modification. The State incorporates an additional criteria, Regulation 26.10(b)(1), that allows the minor permit modification process to be used for permit modifications that involve emission increases.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The additional criteria at Regulation 26.10(b)(1) allows the minor permit modification process to be used for permit modifications that involve emission increases not over 20% of the applicable definition of major source, or 15 tons/year of PM&hyph;10, or 0.6 tons/year of lead, whichever is less, based on potential to emit. 40 CFR 70.7(e)(3)(i) allows group processing of minor modifications that collectively meet this emission threshold, or a total of 5 tons per year (tpy) whichever is less, provided the minor modification criteria at 40 CFR 70.7(e)(2)(i)(A) are also met. However, the criteria for minor modifications at 40 CFR 70.7(e)(2)(i)(A), which applies to individual as well as group processing of minor modifications does not contain this allowance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, Regulation 26.10(b)(1) is inconsistent with the rule at 40 CFR 70.7(e)(2)(i)(A)(5), as well as Regulation 26.10(b)(7). In order for Regulation 26 to provide minor modification procedures consistent with 40 CFR part 70, and as a condition of full approval, the ADPCE must revise Regulation 26.10(b)(1) or delete the allowance from the minor modification procedure. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) Provisions for permit content are found at Regulation 26.7. The State regulations require inclusion of the enumerated elements at 40 CFR 70.6(a), (b), and (c). In order to receive full approval, the State must formally incorporate these provisions by reference or list them specifically in the regulation. Recommended language for formal incorporation by reference would read: ``The Department hereby adopts and incorporates by reference those provisions of 40 CFR 70.6(a), (b), and (c) as in effect on July 21, 1992.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additional provisions are found to provide for adequate permit duration, allow a permit shield, provide for general permits, and provide for temporary sources and emergency situations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Part 70 of the operating permits regulations requires prompt reporting of deviations from the permit requirements. The rule at 40 CFR 70.6(a)(3)(iii)(B) requires the permitting authority to define ``prompt'' in relation to the degree and type of deviation likely to occur and the applicable requirements. The State of Arkansas has not defined ``prompt'' in Regulation 26, and must do so in order to achieve full approval. With formal incorporation by reference and defining ``prompt'' with regard to reporting deviations, the provisions at Regulation 26.7 meet the requirements of 40 CFR 70.6. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) Provisions for operational flexibility and alternative scenarios are listed at Regulation 26.8. This section meets the requirements of 40 CFR 70.4(b)(12) by closely tracking the language of part 70. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g) Enforcement provisions are discussed under Tab 5 of the submittal, Compliance Tracking and Enforcement Program. This section contains copies of the Enforcement Memorandum of Understanding, signed May 3, 1993. The AG Opinion discussed in section 1 above, outlines the State's authority to enforce all aspects of the program. Under Tab 9 of the submittal, the State provides a commitment to submit annual information concerning the State's enforcement activities. These submission elements meet the requirements of 40 CFR 70.4(b)(4)(ii) and (5).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The State of Arkansas has the authority to issue a variance from requirements imposed by State law under Arkansas Code, Annotated (A.C.A.) 8&hyph;4&hyph;313. The EPA regards this provision as wholly external to the program submitted for approval under part 70, and consequently is proposing to take no action on this provision of State law. The EPA has no authority to approve provisions of State law, such as the variance provision referred to, which are inconsistent with the CAA. The EPA does not recognize the ability of a permitting authority to grant relief from the duty to comply with a federally enforceable part 70 permit, except where such relief is granted through the procedures allowed by part 70. A part 70 permit may be issued or revised (consistent with part 70 permitting procedures) to incorporate those terms of a variance that are consistent with applicable requirements. A part 70 permit may also incorporate, via part 70 permit issuance or modification procedures, the schedule of compliance set forth in a variance. However, EPA reserves the right to pursue enforcement of applicable requirements notwithstanding the existence of a compliance schedule in a permit to operate. This is consistent with 40 CFR 70.5(c)(8)(iii)(C), which states that a schedule of compliance ``shall be supplemental to, and shall not sanction noncompliance with, the applicable requirements on which it is based.'' The State provides a legal position on variances in the AG Opinion, Section XXIII, page 9. Historically, Arkansas has not granted a variance without approval from EPA. Counsel for the ADPCE commits to assure that variances are not granted to part 70 sources. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Arkansas operating permits program is contained in Regulation 26, but several applicable requirements are found in Regulation 19 (e.g. PSD requirements at 19.9). The State of Arkansas has submitted a revision to Regulation 19 and the EPA is currently undertaking a review of the revision. The EPA will continue to work closely with the State to ensure consistency between the SIP permits system and operating permits systems in Arkansas. The EPA reserves comment on the SIP revision until such time as review is completed. A subsequent notice will be published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  when the review is complete. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Permit Fee Demonstration <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The State provided a detailed workload analysis and permit fee demonstration to justify the fee of $16 per ton per year. Federal guidance recommends a presumptive minimum fee of $25 per ton per year, based on 1989 dollars and adjusted annually by the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The fee will be applied to the allowable emissions at each part 70 source. Approximately $4.16 million dollars per year is expected to be generated by the Arkansas fee. This figure is based on the emissions inventory and does not include hazardous air pollutant (HAP) emission sources. Program costs are expected to run approximately $3.6 million dollars per year. The State utilized historical information concerning permitting costs and the emissions inventory to estimate the revenue required to fund the program. The EPA noted that the fee demonstration does not estimate resource needs for section 112 programs that will be promulgated in the near future. Expansion of the State program is anticipated to facilitate incorporation of these new requirements. The ADPCE has the authority to adjust the fee as necessary using the State administrative procedures as new applicable requirements are promulgated. The fee demonstration submitted by Arkansas meets the requirements at 40 CFR 70.4(b)(7) and (8). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Provisions Implementing the Requirements of Other Titles of the Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The State of Arkansas acknowledges that its request for approval of a part 70 program is also a request for approval of a program for delegation of unchanged section 112 standards under the authority of section 112(l) as they apply to part 70 sources. Upon receiving approval under section 112(l), the State may receive delegation of any new authority required by section 112 of the Act through the delegation process. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The State also has the option at any time to request, under section 112(l) of the Act, delegation of section 112 requirements in the form of State regulations which the State demonstrates are equivalent to the corresponding section 112 provisions promulgated by the EPA. At this time, the State plans to use the mechanism of incorporation by reference to adopt unchanged Federal section 112 requirements into its regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The radionuclide NESHAP is a section 112 regulation and therefore, also an applicable requirement under the State operating permits program for part 70 sources. There is not yet a Federal definition of ``major'' for radionuclide sources. Therefore, until a major source definition for radionuclides is promulgated, no source would be a major section 112 source solely due to its radionuclide emissions. However, a radionuclide source may, in the interim, be a major source under part 70 for another reason, thus requiring a part 70 permit. The EPA will work with the State in the development of its radionuclide program to ensure that permits are issued in a timely manner. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 112(g) of the Act requires that, after the effective date of a permits program under title V, no person may construct, reconstruct or modify any major source of HAPs unless the State determines that the maximum achievable control technology emission limitation under section 112(g) will be met. Such determination must be made on a case-by-case basis where no applicable limitations have been established by the Administrator. During the period from the title V effective date to the date the State has taken appropriate action to implement the final section 112(g) rule (either adoption of the unchanged Federal rule or approval of an existing State rule under 112(l)), Arkansas intends to implement section 112(g) of the Act through the State's preconstruction process. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The State of Arkansas commits to appropriately implementing and enforcing the existing and future requirements of sections 111, 112 and 129 of the Act, and all maximum achievable control technology (MACT) standards promulgated in the future, in a timely manner.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The submittal was amended with a letter from J.B. Jones, Chief of the Air Division, ADPCE, to Gerald Fontenot, Chief of the Air Programs Branch, EPA, dated January 13, 1994. This letter commits the ADPCE to meet the January 1, 1995, deadline for incorporation and submittal of the Federal acid rain program into the State regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Enforcement Provisions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Arkansas operating permits program submittal addressed the enforcement requirements under Tab 5 of the submittal. This section contains, as required at 40 CFR 70.4(b)(4)(ii) and 70.4 (b)(5), the Enforcement Memorandum of Understanding, signed by the State and the EPA on May 3, 1993. This information serves to describe the current processes in place to track air permits and conduct enforcement actions. The State has committed to use the AIRS computer tracking system in the operating permits program. Under Tab 9 of the submittal, the State committed to annual submission of information concerning the State's enforcement activities. This submission, as required at 40 CFR 70.4(b)(9), includes the number of enforcement actions either commenced or concluded; the penalties, fines, and sentences obtained in those actions; and the number of administrative orders issued. The AG's Opinion under Tab 3 of the submittal clearly documents the State's authority to issue, inspect, and enforce operating permits in both civil and criminal actions. This statement of authority is required at 40 CFR 70.4(b)(3)(vii). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 6.

The technical support documentation shows that all operating permits program requirements of 40 CFR part 70 and relevant guidance were met by the submittal with the exception of those requirements described below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 7. Summary <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The State of Arkansas submitted to the EPA, under a cover letter from the Governor, the State's operating permits program on November 9, 1993. The submittal has adequately addressed all sixteen elements required for full approval as discussed in part 70 with the exception of the issues described in section B below. The State of Arkansas addressed appropriately all requirements necessary to receive interim approval of the State operating permits program pursuant to title V of the Act, 1990 Amendments and 40 CFR part 70. The EPA is proposing interim approval for the operating permits program submittal for the State of Arkansas. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B.

As discussed in section A.2.d above, the State must remove or revise the language at Regulation 26.10(b)(1). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=26 g=1 f=3 --> Definition of ``prompt'' <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=26 g=1 f=1 --> . As discussed in section A.2.e above, the State must define ``prompt'' with regard to reporting deviations in order to be consistent with the rule at 40 CFR 70.6(a)(3)(iii)(B). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=26 g=1 f=3 --> Submission of Regulation 19 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=26 g=1 f=1 --> . As discussed in section A.2 above, The State of Arkansas must ensure consistency between the operating permits program, Regulation 26, and the SIP, Regulation 19. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Evidence of these regulatory revisions and their procedurally correct adoption must be submitted to EPA within 18 months of EPA's approval of the Arkansas operating permits program. This interim approval, which may not be renewed, extends for a period of up to two years. During the interim approval period, the State is protected from sanctions for failure to have a program, and the EPA is not obligated to promulgate a Federal permits program in the State. Permits issued under a program with interim approval have full standing with respect to 40 CFR part 70, and the one year time period for submittal of permit applications by subject sources begins upon interim approval, as does the three year time period for processing the initial permit applications. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the interim approval is converted to a disapproval, it will not affect any existing State requirements applicable to small entities. Federal disapproval of the State submittal does not affect its State-enforceability. Moreover, the EPA's disapproval of the submittal does not impose a new Federal requirement. Requirements for approval, specified in 40 CFR 70.4(b), encompass section 112(l)(5) approval requirements for delegation of section 112 standards as promulgated by EPA as they apply to part 70 sources. Section 112(l)(5) requires that the State's program contain adequate authorities, adequate resources for implementation, and an expeditious compliance schedule, which are also requirements under 40 CFR part 70.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Proposed Rulemaking Action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In this action, EPA is proposing interim approval of the operating permits program submitted by the State of Arkansas. The program was submitted by the State to EPA for the purpose of complying with Federal requirements found at the 1990 Amendments, title V and at part 70, which mandates that States develop, and submit to EPA, programs for issuing operating permits to all major stationary sources and certain other sources, with the exception of Indian Lands. Therefore, the EPA is also promulgating approval under section 112(l)(5) and 40 CFR 63.91 of the State's program for receiving delegation of section 112 standards that are unchanged from Federal standards as promulgated. This program for delegations only applies to sources covered by the part 70 program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA has reviewed this submittal of the Arkansas operating permits program and is proposing interim approval. Certain defects in the State's regulations preclude EPA from granting full approval of the State's operating permits program at this time. EPA is proposing to grant interim approval, subject to the State obtaining the needed regulatory revisions within 18 months after the Administrator's approval of the Arkansas title V program pursuant to 40 CFR 70.4. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV.

Alternatively, the EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 01 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Operating permits program approvals under section 502 of the Act do not create any new requirements, but simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal operating permits program approval does not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the Act, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of State action.

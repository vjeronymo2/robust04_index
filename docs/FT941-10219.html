			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Elbief mounts modest recovery Reduced overheads and increased production helped Elbief, the manufacturer of photograph and handbag frames, mirrors and clocks, to report lower interim losses. On turnover marginally ahead at Pounds 1.95m (Pounds 1.9m), losses for the six months to October 31 narrowed to Pounds 138,000 (Pounds 244,000). Directors said domestic sales had shown a marked improvement, especially to high street multiples, but exports, particularly to Europe, remained depressed. Further cost reductions were being sought. Losses per share were 0.11p (0.2p).</p>

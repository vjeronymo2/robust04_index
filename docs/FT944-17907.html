			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / A sunny spot in grey Japan On the Japanese Regional Banking Association's latest regional banking 'weather' map, which indicates the strength of the local economies, the only sunny area in the country was the southern island of Kyushu. Although the recent spate of economic data has indicated that Japan is facing a lacklustre recovery, businesses in Kyushu are feeling more confident than their counterparts elsewhere in the country. Part of the cheer stems from the minimal effects of the asset 'bubble' of the late 1980s. Unlike the economies surrounding the larger cities such as Tokyo and Osaka, which have been hit by the plunge in real estate prices, Kyushu was relatively unaffected by speculative activity. Confidence is also supported by Kyushu's provincial governments, striving to become the main crossroads for Japan and south-east Asia, which have been pumping capital into infrastructure projects in the region. Sports facilities and hotels are being built for next year's Universiade games in Fukuoka city. Convention and shopping complexes are expected to be built before the Asia Development Bank's convention there in 1997. Kyushu has been seeing the benefits of capital investment by leading manufacturers over the past few years. Nissan Motor and Toyota Motor both have plants, along with companies in the semiconductor industry such as Iwashita Engineering, and Mitsui High-Tech. The main attraction for companies is cheap labour and land prices. Nissan's Zama plant on the outskirts of Tokyo is estimated to be worth Y240,000 (Pounds 1,558) a sq m, but Toyota reportedly paid Y16,000 to Y17,000 a sq m for its Kyushu plant. Another is that 'the proximity to south-east Asia is a leading advantage for companies moving into Kyushu', says Mr James Fiorillo, analyst at brokers Baring Securities in Tokyo. Mr Hiroshi Morimoto at the Kyushu Economic Research Centre adds that Kyushu will become an important back-up base for companies which have moved their manufacturing bases to Asia. The increase in population as a result of the investments has supported consumption in the region. July department store sales in Kyushu were up 1.2 per cent on July of 1993, in spite of a 29-month consecutive decline for the nation. The Fukuoka stock exchange, which expects new listings of about 10 companies this fiscal year to March, saw trading volume rise by 4.5 times in June from a year earlier, and 7 times in July. Lending growth at Kyushu-based regional banks has been steady in spite of the first fall in loan growth on record experienced by the country's large commercial banks. Bank of Fukuoka, says outstanding lending rose 2.9 per cent in August to Y3,988bn. The real test will come when the wave of investments recedes. Some bankers are already cautious. 'We aren't sure if there will be enough demand once the facilities and hotels are finished,' says Mr Toshihide Marutani, an official at the Bank of Fukuoka's economic research department. Others believe the region's growth will be sustained as long as the rest of the country catches up.</p>

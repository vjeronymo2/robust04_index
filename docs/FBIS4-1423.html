			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with IFP leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi in Ulundi -- </F> live; monitored in progress]    [Text] [Buthelezi] ...the letter that I received from the  judge. The judge phoned me yesterday, and he also sent me a  letter promising that the ballots would be sent this morning,  etc. And I think there's been a distortion, of course, in the  media about my statement yesterday when I said that if the  ballot hasn't got the sticker for the IFP [Inkatha Freedom  Party] and people use it in spite of that, that would be an  infringement of the agreement that we made on the 19th, which  took place when we met with Mr. Mandela, and Mr. de Klerk in  Pretoria, and that therefore if that is done in spite of, and  also the insistence that people must write their names instead  of insisting on the sticker, I said that I would place before  the Central Committee and propose that we perhaps pull out of  the elections.    But I think there is a mistake now because it seems that  some  people in the media say that I threatened. By making a  statement like that that I threatened to pull out, I have no  intention of pulling out. But quite clearly I mean if these  very glaring things continue then I have to call a meeting with  the Central Committee, but I've not threatened to pull out as  appears to be the case. I saw a headline in one of the papers  today stating that I, you know, I've threatened that we are  going to pull out.    [Unidentified correspondent] About the holiday Mr. Chief  Minister, some areas here are still open, do you think in fact  people didn't know that it was a holiday today?    [Buthelezi] No, in fact even the way that was handled, for  instance, I was told that this was discussed with some of the  leaders, our leaders, I don't know which ones, but I'm one of  those that were not consulted. I have no objection to the  holiday as such, but I think it was really handled in a very  inapt fashion, because I think all of us should have known, and  we should have announced to the people that it is in fact a  holiday.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Special Weekend Edition"] </F>   [Text] A pleasurable read. A selection of the most  interesting items. This opportunity will be afforded to  ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA readers from July by the publication of our  weekend edition. This will not simply be a "Sunday" version of  our newspaper. It will not just be an absorbing read -- there  will also be private meetings with celebrities, highly topical  stories, coverage of unusual events and unusual real-life  stories, and an invitation to readers to enter secret archives  and "closed" laboratories.    The new edition will provide our subscribers with a news  dossier on breaking stories in all walks of life that relate to  people's vital interests. It can therefore act as useful  notification, advice, or a counter-recommendation. The weekend  ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA will also be an authoritative TV viewers'  guide. Several pages will be devoted to detailed coverage of  what TV is saying and showing, a full weekly TV schedule, notes  on the most entertaining shows, meetings with popular  presenters, and a "behind-the-scenes" look at TV. The TV guide  will feature clear descriptions -- so viewers will not have to  guess whether the evening's movie is a thriller or a weepie.    Separate subscription is being organized to the Sunday  ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA. The cost for six months will be 9,000  rubles.</p>

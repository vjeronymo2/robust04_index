As the Transitional Executive Council [TEC] revealed the  design that will flutter over public buildings for the next five  years after the April election, outside condemnation already  came in from some quarters. Other parties ventured to express  cautious acceptance, while some have yet to comment.    In its reaction the Democratic Party [DP] said national  symbols such as the flag should be decided by a referendum. DP  spokesman Rob Harper said the decision should not be made by the  National Party or the African National Congress [ANC], but by  all the people of this country.    ANC Regional Publicity Chief Yulelani Nguko commended the  TEC  criteria for the design, but slammed it for having nothing which  one can identify with. Mr. Nguko who was speaking in his  personal capacity said this may have been the key reason why  everybody agreed on it.    Minority Front leader Amichand Rajbansi came out in favor of  the flag saying it accommodated both majorities as well as  minorities.</p>

			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Trinity agrees Malaysian bus joint venture Trinity Holdings, the UK's leading specialist vehicle manufacturer, yesterday signed a Pounds 3.5m joint venture deal to supply and build buses in Malaysia. The company claimed that the agreement with the UMW manufacturing group represented one of the first Anglo-Malaysian trade deals since the Kuala Lumpar government imposed an embargo on offering government contracts to British companies last February. Mr Geoff Hollyhead, chairman, said Trinity would retain 35 per cent of a joint venture company which aims to build 600 buses a year for the Malaysian market. The buses will be assembled from kits supplied by Trinity subsidiaries - Dennis Specialist Vehicles and Duple Metsec. In addition to payments for the kits, the company will receive Pounds 700,000 annually in transfer technology fees for five years and share in the joint venture's profits. Mr Hollyhead said total demand could exceed 30,000 vehicles. A new plant will meet both local demand and serve markets elsewhere in the Asia-Pacific region.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ze'ev Schiff] </F>   [Text] Should the PLO be helped, how much, and on what  conditions to assure that the agreement with Israel succeeds?  That question will pop up and be asked again and again. It is  not simple, if only because of the emotional baggage trailing a  body that was regarded until yesterday, and which some still  see, as Israel's sworn and most hostile enemy. Many people still  are not convinced that it will not make an about turn and that  the Palestinians, led by the PLO or another of their  organizations, will not again seek war against Israel.    Many in the right camp want the agreement to fail and put an  end to the "concession process." They would like to see a civil  war and bloodshed on the other side. The approach taken by  others combines scorn with vindictive satisfaction. They say  that chaos reigns among the Palestinians, that the PLO has come  in unprepared despite all the pleas that have been made to it  and that its leaders do not care about the common people. This  is an arrogant view, as though only Israelis are capable of  managing independent existence. These people are willing to  offer assistance to the Palestinians, but from an attitude that  is paternal and sometimes insulting. Many of these people  foresee failure and say that no level of aid will help the  Palestinians, not because they do not want to succeed but  because they are doomed to fail.    Within the Israeli Government, and particularly among senior  defense officials, a leading, important group contends that the  little experience we have teaches that there is someone to talk  to. They are referring, first of all, to the Palestinian  leadership in the territories, to the police command and to  prisoners released from Israeli jails (but not to the  intellectual class). We must show patience, they say; it will  not be long before the Palestinian system begins to stabilize.  Of 10, including the prime minister, who spoke at a conference  held in the Defense Ministry for newspaper editors and other  journalists, eight used such language or similar terms to state  that Israel must help the Palestinians maintain the agreement.  Even the other two speakers did not dissent. They are ready to  aid the civil administration in particular. More than any  others, they recognize the difficulties and how unprepared the  Palestinians are. Still, they explain that this is not just the  Palestinians' problem, and that failure on the Palestinian side  is liable to create a problem for Israel, too.    This group advances the argument that the Palestinians must  be helped to maintain the agreement. It is persuading the  political branch of the need for help in basic matters in order  to prevent hardship in the territories, which would benefit  Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] and Islamic Jihad. Aid is  sometimes seen in the territories without approval from above.  Even so, even this group does not concede testing on the ground  and the need to progress in stages under the agreement.    The premise is that along with assistance, every detail in  realization of the agreement must be strictly observed, that no  possibility of deviation from the gradual process can be allowed  and that Israel must react to every violation. Some say that the  monitoring should be done by those responsible in the  territories and not by lawyers who, by their nature, are  inclined to dot every i cross every t.    But even as everything is set for inspection, we also cannot  ignore certain worrisome signs. At the top of the list stand  'Arafat's statements, which have received extensive coverage.  'Arafat also stands behind the instruction to break off  agreements and relations with Israeli companies. That is his  right, but that also is a formula for increasing hardship among  residents of the Gaza Strip. Until recently, 'Arafat had led the  way towards an agreement and blocked opposition to conciliation  between the two peoples. And now, the new and worrisome line he  took in his declaration is a continuation of the dispute--not an  end to it.    Some of us are prepared to justify and offer pretexts in  advance for every PLO violation of the agreement. The discussion  is not being carried on with them. In any event, they are a  marginal faction. The discussion is being carried on with the  Palestinian leadership, which seeks conciliation. When lame  excuses are heard from them, such as that it was the Kuraysh  tribe that violated the agreement with Muhammad, and not the  other way around, so that 'Arafat's statement was correct--it  must be said that after so prolonged a dispute, there are no  naive Israelis. Right from the start, even before the ink was  dry on the signatures, the PLO chairman has been comparing the  Oslo and Cairo agreements to the truces called by the Prophet  Muhammed, and it makes no difference at all who breaks the  agreements. 'Arafat is ignoring the essence of the agreement in  principle, which speaks of a process towards a permanent peace  and reconciliation. That is another good reason to make a  forceful demand for abrogation of the clauses in the Palestinian  Covenant denying the existence of Israel, as 'Arafat pledged but  has not done.    We cannot forget, however, that Israel has an interest in  the  success of the agreement. Otherwise, we would not have embarked  on this course and the Oslo agreement in principle would not  have been signed. Therefore, we must help the PLO to abide by it  and to overcome opponents of the agreement. The main condition  is an end to the killing of Israelis, and the PLO must make  every effort to stop it. It cannot be expected that Palestinians  will kill us and that we will help them or, even more, give them  financial support.</p>

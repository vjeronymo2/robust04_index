			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Israel and Palestine resume peace talks Israel and Palestinian negotiators resumed detailed talks on implementing a framework peace accord yesterday focusing on Israel's security demands and Palestinian calls for release of up to 12,000 political prisoners, Julian Ozanne writes. Israel's state TV later said the Jewish state would free up to 2,000 Palestinian prisoners in two weeks, with preference given to sick, aged, or especially young prisoners, and those who had served over two-thirds of their sentences. Earlier Mr Dennis Ross, US co-ordinator for Middle East peace talks arrived in Jerusalem from Jordan for talks with Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister and Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister. Mr Ross is touring the region to help consolidate the accord, to prepare for an early November visit by Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, and to try to broker progress on stalled talks between Israel and Syria. Before leaving Amman he said the US could support secret talks between Jerusalem and Damascus to break the deadlock.</p>

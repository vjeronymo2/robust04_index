			<p><P> August 28, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY VOICES;  </P> <P> FIXING PUBLIC'S 'BROKEN WINDOWS';  </P> <P> SANTA ANA CIVIC CENTER DISORDER IS A 'BROKEN WINDOW' THAT INVITES MORE  ANTISOCIAL BEHAVIOR IF NOT FIXED BY POLICE.  </P> <P> The issue the community of Santa Ana is facing is one of crime and disorder.  Recently, attention has been focused on events occurring in our Civic Center,  the seat of Orange County's government. Thousands of people from all walks of  life frequent the area daily. Workers, schoolchildren, the elderly and  individuals of all ages are conducting business or enjoying a visit.  </P> <P> When disorderly behavior in the Civic Center or anywhere else goes unchallenged  the message is clear that no one cares. If allowed to persist, disorder  escalates and serious crime soon follows.  </P> <P> Urinating in public, drunkenness, aggressive panhandling, rude and sexually  offensive remarks and vandalism are some of the many disorders witnessed daily  by people in the heart of our city. The stench of human waste is repugnant; the  possibility of being accosted is frightening, and an extreme atmosphere of  disarray is prevalent. The purpose of our enforcement efforts has consistently  been to reinstate the public order that has noticeably evaporated. We are  repairing the "broken windows."  </P> <P> Two well-recognized figures in the field of policing, James Q. Wilson and  George L. Kelling, first documented the "broken windows" phenomenon in an  article published in 1982. When the first window is broken in a building and it  is not repaired, the people will conclude that no one cares about the building  and more windows will be broken. Eventually the building will have no windows  and the condition will be compounded by more serious damage.  </P> <P> Similarly, when disorderly behavior is allowed to flourish it becomes the  "broken window."  </P> <P> The level of disorder in the Civic Center is rising. Serious crime, assaults,  thefts, rapes and robberies are also increasing. Coincident with these  documented increases in unruly behavior and major wrongdoings has been an  increase in fear.  </P> <P> Pressing personal concerns have been conveyed to me by the community. Wilson  and Kelling cite research results which confirm what working police officers  already know: Even though many people are frightened by crime, especially crime  involving a sudden, violent attack by a stranger, we cannot overlook or forget  that a source of substantial, real fear is the dread of being accosted by  disorderly people, by people who are inebriated, throw trash on the ground,  openly urinate and defecate in public places, or who aggressively beg.  </P> <P> This fear not only has been related to me as a police chief but also has been  described in many recent media reports. It is more than mere disapproval of  offensive behavior. Sociologist Nathan Glazer, describing subway graffiti,  portrayed its existence as an inescapable knowledge that the environment that  must be endured has become "uncontrolled and uncontrollable, and that anyone  can invade it to do whatever damage and mischief the mind suggests."  </P> <P> This fear is based on a visceral intuition, all too frequently confirmed by  subsequent reality, that when we allow unruly conduct to flourish severe crime  problems quickly ensue. The reality of serious crime is with the Police  Department every day. This fuels our fundamental duty to safeguard lives and  property.  </P> <P> My reaffirmation of the public's control of their space is an emphasis on crime  prevention. By seeking to decrease the visible signs of disorder, I am striving  to prevent the Civic Center from becoming a haven for those who are looking for  easy targets of prey.  </P> <P> Throughout history, whenever people have lived together they have found it  necessary to develop rules of conduct. Contemporary American laws, based on  English common law, may be traced back more than 3,600 years ago to the ancient  times of Hammurabi. In our democratic society we are governed by the  Constitution of the United States. Federal, state and local laws are designed  to maintain order, discourage violence and to safeguard lives and property.  Police are ethically bound to uphold the laws of the land.  </P> <P> I am not pursuing a campaign to drive any specific group from the Civic Center  area. My intent and purpose is to reestablish the rules of conduct, which all  people expect in a civil society.  </P> <P> The standards of behavior I am rebuilding are not ones that have been created  by the police. We are enforcing norms that have been established by our  community through their elected representatives, which have been codified in  ordinances and laws. Observance of these regulations indicates to everyone that  this space is safe and secure. If anyone doubts that these norms have been  increasingly unobserved, they need only to ask the many who recently viewed an  amorous couple mating in full daylight view.  </P> <P> The Civic Center was not designed as a campground. It is unfortunate that a  segment of our society has been driven to seek shelter here. But the police  must insist that the area is safe for those who are observing our community  standards of behavior. Continually increasing disorder in the area, left  unchecked, will not only lead to more serious crime but also certainly  contribute to the belief that democratic government has become totally futile.  </P> <P> If the very seat of government is characterized by unruliness, how can we be  expected to police our neighborhoods, or confront the many other problems that  by consensus we have been asked by our community to address? Our responsibility  is to maintain order and to prevent future problems by fixing those "broken  windows" wherever we find them.  </P></p>

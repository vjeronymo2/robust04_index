			<p>BFN     [Text] India's ambassador to the United States, Mr.  Siddhartha Shankar Ray, says that Pakistan continues to  interfere in the internal affairs of India. He said he has  collected evidence of this during his two-day visit to Jammu and  Kashmir. Mr. Ray was talking to newspersons in New Delhi. He  said the evidence collected relates to the foreign mercenaries  in Kashmir, foreign arms and ammunition seized, and the location  of camps where the Pakistan authorities have been training  terrorists. The ambassador said approximately 44,000 Hindus,  Sikh, and Muslim families have fled the valley because of the  militant activities.    Mr. Ray said the delivery of more F-16 aircraft to Islamabad  by Washington will not reduce tension in South Asia nor will it  promote any dialogue between India and Pakistan. He warned the  United States that if it does not desist from this course, the  arms race in the subcontinent will be fueled.</p>

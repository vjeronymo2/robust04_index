			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Randah Taqiy-al-Din in Paris] </F>   [Text] An informed French source has told AL-HAYAH that the  two French oil companies, Elf Aquitaine and Total, can now sign  a contract on oil exploration and development in the Iraqi oil  fields of Nahr 'Umar, Total's area of operations, and Majnun,  Elf Aquitaine's area of operations, despite the international  embargo clamped on Iraq.    The source added that the contract, after it is signed, will  only be implemented after the post-embargo phase. He said that  signing a contract that cannot be immediately implemented does  not require a political decision but a decision by the two  companies.    The source pointed out that the only obstacle to signature  now is the fact that negotiations with the Iraqi side have not  yet ended, especially with regard to the terms of participation  in exploration and development in the two oil fields. He  explained that the visit to Paris by an Iraqi oil delegation led  by Tahir Hammud, the Iraqi deputy oil minister, was confined to  reviewing technical issues and that no actual negotiations were  held between the two sides. He said that if the embargo on Iraq  is lifted, it would take approximately two years before  production begins in the Nahr 'Umar and Majnun oil fields. He  described the production capacity of the two oil fields as  important.    It is noteworthy that several French officials were eager to  reiterate that despite these negotiations and talks no oil  contract would be signed with Iraq as long as the international  embargo is valid.    In another development, Lee Hamilton, head of the Foreign  Affairs Committee in the U.S. House of Representatives, has  accused President Bill Clinton's administration of violating the  economic embargo imposed on Iraq by indirectly purchasing fuel  from Iraqi oil refineries for use in transportation and heating  purposes in Kurdish areas in northern Iraq.</p>

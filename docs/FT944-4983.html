			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Observer: Bets on Bentsen While the election of a hostile Republican Congress last month had seemed to confer job security on virtually the entire Clinton cabinet, the rumour that treasury secretary Lloyd Bentsen is poised to pack his bags is the one that will not go away. 'Y'all keep asking me that question and one of these days you're gonna be right,' he barked back at hacks even before the mid-term elections. Yesterday he brushed off renewed speculation as 'premature', whilst simultaneously managing to convey the impression that he was off in a matter of months - if not weeks. While the courtly, cunning 73-year-old Texan may initially have seemed the odd man out in a youthful administration, Bentsen had actually grown close to President Clinton, who, for instance, bowed to his advice to fight a lonely battle for the North American Free Trade Agreement. Having served seven years in the House of Representatives and 22 years in the Senate, he would also have been a useful link between an administration lacking in 'greyheads' and a Republican Congress, where he has many friends. But the septuagenarian is supposedly looking forward to getting back into business - quite what, he hasn't said. His father built a fortune on land sales to Mexicans while Bentsen junior made his money from 16 years in the rather staider world of insurance. The puzzle, though, is why, at his stage in life, should that be more alluring than benignly neglecting the dollar?</p>

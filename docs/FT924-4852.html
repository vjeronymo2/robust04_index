			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / Yeltsin ban on party upheld: Court verdict makes symbolic concessions to Communists RUSSIA'S highest court yesterday closed a drawn-out trial of the Communist party with a compromise verdict that makes symbolic concessions to supporters of the party without reversing its dismantling by President Boris Yeltsin. The decision by the Constitutional Court, which said Mr Yeltsin was right after the August coup last year to ban the party's top bodies but not its local cells, enables both sides to claim victory while sparing Mr Yeltsin charges that he controls the courts. Such charges could have undermined his authority at the Congress of People's Deputies which opens today amid threats by deputies to press for the government's removal. A political adviser to the government said a few ministers might be sacrificed in the course of negotiations which will continue throughout the Congress with the centrist Civic Union opposition group. Mr Andrei Nechayev, the economics minister, even set out the possibility of Mr Yegor Gaidar resigning as prime minister in favour of somebody who would not interfere with economic policy. He also suggested a technical resignation of the whole government which would, however, amount to little more than a gimmick. But Civic Union leaders are also divided over how far to push the government. The court, asked to review the legitimacy of President Yeltsin's decrees disbanding the party and confiscating its property, found he was right to dismantle its top bodies and take over state property appropriated by the party. But it found against his decision to dismantle local branches and against the transfer to the state of property paid for by rank and file members. Mr Valentin Kuptsov, one of the former senior Communists who challenged the president's decrees in the court, said the decision gave the Congress 'good grounds' to seek President Yeltsin's impeachment. It also cleared the way for the Communist party to reconstitute itself and sue for the return of its property. However, it is difficult to see how party cells can reconstitute an organisation with its top bodies still banned. Lawyers for Mr Yeltsin suggested that property would not be retrievable in the courts. The state would have to continue making it available to society at large. Russia and its western creditors remain divided over how much of the former Soviet Union's foreign debt the country is capable of repaying next year, putting off attempts to agree a debt rescheduling until mid-December. The Paris Club of creditor states is offering a 10-year rescheduling with a five-year grace period which would make Russia pay Dollars 5bn next year, while Moscow is saying it can only pay Dollars 2.5bn. The ball is still in the air, Page 16</p>

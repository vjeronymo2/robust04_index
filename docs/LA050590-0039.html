			<p><P> May 5, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CAL LUTHERAN BREEZES TO THIRD TITLE IN A ROW  </P> <P> A gusty wind was blowing in at Cal Lutheran's Gibello Field on Friday, but that  didn't stop the Regals from blowing Cal Baptist out of the NAIA District 3  softball championships.  </P> <P> Cal Lutheran had six consecutive hits in a four-run fifth inning that broke a  scoreless tie and gave the Regals a 4-0 second-game victory and a sweep of the  best-of-three series.  </P> <P> After winning the first game, 5-1, Cal Lutheran clinched its third consecutive  District 3 title with its big fifth inning in the second game.  </P> <P> The outburst was sparked by an out rather than a hit. After Cal Lutheran's Kim  White was called out on a close play at third, Leslie Stevens immediately  followed with a triple to right center that scored Dani Piotrowski with what  turned out to be the winning run.  </P> <P> "I was just mad they called Kim White out. I couldn't believe that," Stevens  said.  </P> <P> Stevens scored on Cheryl Aschenbach's subsequent double, and DeeAndra  Pilkington followed with a run-scoring triple. Alysa Mathews then singled in  Pilkington to complete the scoring.  </P> <P> "You don't get us mad," Cal Lutheran Coach Tony Venditto said. "We play with a  lot of emotion, and that was one of the things we were lacking."  </P> <P> Cal Lutheran (31-10-2) has won 19 of its last 20 games, but Venditto believes  his team has been emotionally flat since spring break. Cal Lutheran won a  ho-hum first game on Pilkington's four-hitter.  </P> <P> "They came in on a real high," Venditto said of Cal Baptist (23-24). "Our goal  the first game is to shut them down."  </P> <P> Stevens (13-4), who has won her last 10 decisions, threw a two-hitter for Cal  Lutheran, which is now one round away from making its third trip in a row to  the NAIA nationals. The Regals play next week in the bi-district tournament  against the winner of the District 7 championships.  </P> <P> In the first game, Pilkington (16-6) struck out six and allowed only one  unearned run. The Regals led, 1-0, after four innings and scored four runs in  the fifth, the key hit a two-run single by Mathews.  </P> <P> White finished the day six for eight off freshman right-hander Amy Dawson  (14-12), who started and lost both games.  </P> <P> With the sweep, Cal Lutheran avoided a potential third game that had been  scheduled for today.  </P> <P> "We didn't want to play them (today) at all," Venditto said. "We kept stressing  all week there's only two games."  </P></p>

			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Rhodium plunge forces Westplats to close shaft THE COLLAPSE of rhodium's price has forced Western Platinum, the world's third-largest platinum group metals producer, to close a shaft at its biggest mine in South Africa and to lay off 1,500 people or 10 per cent of the workforce. This was revealed yesterday by Mr Terry Wilkinson, Westplats' managing director in an otherwise upbeat presentation to the Association of Mining Analysts in London. Mr Wilkinson pointed out the group put the shaft on care and maintenance only to cut costs and to ensure that Westplats' borrowings did not rise above the present R800m (Pounds 106m). Westplats' rhodium output, scheduled to be about 50,000 troy ounces in the financial year to end-September, would not be affected because production would be increased in other mining areas. Rhodium, an essential material for some automotive anti-pollution catalysts, raced up to a record Dollars 7,000 an ounce in 1990 but had fallen back to Dollars 1,850 by the end of last year and recently fell to about Dollars 800 an ounce. In its annual survey of the platinum metals market published earlier this week, Johnson Matthey, the world's biggest platinum marketing group, warned that the recent rise in platinum's price was unlikely to compensate the South African producers for the fall in rhodium and that production cuts might have to be made. JM suggested there was a small supply surplus of platinum last year but Mr Wilkinson said his impression was that the platinum and rhodium markets were in balance. Westplats sells directly to only 14 customers - including Engelhard in the US and Mitsubishi in Japan - and Mr Wilkinson said that there had been no sign that they had been using rhodium from stock. Westplats aims to produce 480,000 ounces of platinum this year and by 1995 expects annual production to include 550,000 ounces of platinum and 65,000 ounces of rhodium. Mr Wilkinson said the group's recent expansion had been, and would continue to be, driven by demand from the small group of customers. 'We would not put platinum into the spot market.' He said that Westplats was 'over the capital expenditure hump' and needed to spend only about R40m a year for some time. No decision had yet been taken on various methods of reducing debt but a rights issue had not been ruled out. Mr Wilkinson pointed out, however, that Mr Dieter Bock, new chief executive of Lonrho, which owns 73 per cent of Westplats, had said that Lonrho would retain at least 51 per cent of Westplats. Gencor of South Africa owns 27 per cent of Westplats and has indicated that it would like to increase its stake. Analysts said that the positive tone of the presentation, during which Mr Wilkinson said Westplats was the lowest-cost platinum metals producer with the highest profit margins, implied the company was being readied for stock market flotation.</p>

DPR&hyph;58 and DPR&hyph;74 which authorize operation of the Donald C. Cook Nuclear Plant, Units 1 and 2, at steady-state reactor power levels not in excess of 3250 and 3411 megawatts thermal, respectively. The Donald C. Cook facilities are pressurized water reactors located at the licensee's site in Berrien County, Michigan.

(That section has since been renumbered 2002). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The licensee is requesting approval to leave approximately 942 cubic meters of slightly contaminated sludge in place underneath the upper parking lot on the D.C. Cook site. In 1982, approximately 942 cubic meters of slightly contaminated sludge were removed from the turbine room sump absorption pond and pumped to the upper parking lot located within the exclusion area of the D.C. Cook plant. The contaminated sludge was spread over an area approximately 4.7 acres. The sludge contained a total radionuclide inventory of 8.89 millicuries (mCi) of Cesium&hyph;137, Cesium&hyph;136, Cesium&hyph;134, Cobalt&hyph;60, and Iodine&hyph;131. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to 10 CFR 20.2301, ``The Commission may, upon application by a licensee or upon its own initiative, grant an exemption from the requirements of the regulations in this part if it determines the exemption is authorized by law and would not result in undue hazard to life or property.'' The staff has determined that the requested approval for disposal of licensed material pursuant to Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 20, Section 2002 necessitates an exemption to 10 CFR 20.2001. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The licensee in 1982 evaluated the following potential exposure pathways to members of the general public from the radionuclides in the sludge: (1) External exposure caused by groundshine from the disposal site, (2) internal exposure caused by inhalation of resuspended radionuclide, and (3) internal exposure from ingesting ground water. The staff has reviewed the licensee's calculational methods and assumptions and finds that they are consistent with NUREG&hyph;1101, ``Onsite Disposal of Radioactive Waste,'' Volumes 1 and 2, November 1986 and February 1987, respectively. The staff finds the assessment methodology acceptable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The doses calculated by the licensee for the maximally exposed member of the public based on a total activity of 8.89 mCi disposed are listed below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <TABLE>  <!-- PJG tableformat 2,L2,tp0,i1,s25,7 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 --> &blank; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Pathway <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Whole body dose received by maximally exposed individual (mrem/yr) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0152 intable -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=1 --> Groundshine <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 0.94 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Inhalation <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> .94 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Groundwater Ingestion <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> .73 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0162 intable --> n,s <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Total <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 2.61 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </TABLE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For perspective, the radiation from the naturally occurring radionuclides in soils and rocks plus cosmic radiation gives a person in Michigan a whole-body dose rate of about 89 mrem per year outdoors. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On July 5, 1991, the licensee re-sampled the onsite disposal area to assure that no significant impacts and adverse effects had occurred. A counting procedure based on the appropriate environmental low-level doses was used by the licensee; however, no activity was detected during the re-sampling. This is consistent with the original activity of the material and the decay time. The reduced level of radioactivity would not be detectable against background through the shielding provided by the parking lot surface. The 1991 re-sampling process used by the licensee confirms that the radiological impact of the 1982 disposal was very small. Based on the staff's review of the licensee's discussion, the staff finds that the potential radiation exposure due to leaving the contaminated sludge in place is significant. Based on the staff review of the exposure potential of the original quantity of material, and the measured level of decay, the continued presence of the material poses no more radiological impact than disposal methods authorized by 10 CFR 20.2001. Therefore, the licensee's proposed action would not pose a radiological hazard to life or property and the exemption to 10 CFR 20.2001 allowing onsite storage of the radioactive material pursuant to 10 CFR 20.2002 is acceptable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The staff has reviewed the licensee's request and concluded that issuance of this exemption will not endanger life or property and will have no significant effect on the safety of the public or the plant. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, the Commission has determined, pursuant to 10 CFR 20.2301, that this exemption as described in Section IV is authorized by law, will not endanger life or property and is otherwise in the public interest. Therefore, the Commission hereby grants an exemption from the requirements of 10 CFR 20.2001. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.32, the Commission has determined that granting of this exemption will have no significant impact on the environment (October 31, 1994, 59 FR 54477). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This exemption is effective upon issuance. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated at Rockville, Maryland this 10th day of November 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Jack W.

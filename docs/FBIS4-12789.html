			<p>BFN     [Text] Beirut, April 13 (AFP)--A Lebanese court has  sentenced to death two Syrian soldiers and a Lebanese fugitive  for the 1992 murder of two Lebanese Christian brothers, court  officials said Wednesday [13 April].    The sentence, which cannot be appealed, was the first to be  issued by the Court of Justice since the 1970s.    It comes after the government decided last month to  reactivate capital punishment in Lebanon.    The soldiers 'Abd-al Karim Jeij and Muhammad Zaatar had been  handed over by Syria to Lebanese authorities as part of the  investigation into the murder of jewellers Ghassan and Jalil  Antonios.    The soldiers were not present in court when the verdict was  announced on Tuesday.    Lebanese fugitive Nehme Hamade lives in Belgium, which has  refused a Lebanese request to extradite him.    On March 11 parliament voted in a law bringing in the death  penalty for political crimes and scrapping an extenuating  circumstances clause which had exempted politically-motivated  crimes.    The vote was part of a package of measures by the government  to tighten security and legal procedures following a church  bombing in February which killed 10 people and wounded 54 others.    The death penalty, always by hanging, has only been applied  three times in the past 35 years in Lebanon. The last execution  was carried out in 1983.</p>

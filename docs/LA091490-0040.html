			<p><P> September 14, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> UNHEALTHY AIR AGAIN BLANKETS SIMI VALLEY  </P> <P> A thick, milky smog that crept in from the Los Angeles area continued to hang  over eastern Ventura County on Thursday, causing officials to declare the air  in Simi Valley "unhealthful" for the third time this week.  </P> <P> So far this year the air has been unhealthy -- or in violation of federal  standards -- 13 times in the county. Eight of those violations have occurred in  Simi Valley.  </P> <P> "The air is so thick -- it looks like you could cut it with a knife," said Pam  Campeau, assistant executive director of the Simi Valley Chamber of Commerce.  </P> <P> But while the residents of Simi Valley choked through the haze, the air was  listed as good Thursday in coastal areas of the county.  </P> <P> "It's not bad around here," Herman Ragsdale, an air quality specialist with the  county Air Pollution Control District, said of the air in the Ventura area.  "Normally a sea breeze blows everything out."  </P> <P> Last year the air quality standards exceeded federal regulations 46 times in  Ventura County, with most of the violations occurring in the eastern part of  the county and in Ojai.  </P> <P> Usually the smog blows up from Oxnard and Camarillo and settles between the  eastern hills.  </P> <P> Occasionally, the wind blows the smog from the San Fernando Valley into the  eastern county. On Thursday, Piru barely missed violating air-quality  standards.  </P> <P> "This has certainly been one of the worst days of the year," Ragsdale said  Thursday.  </P> <P> Simi Valley also registered unhealthful air on Sunday and Wednesday. The air  exceeded federal health standards in Piru and Thousand Oaks on Sunday.  </P> <P> But relief is in sight, said Kent Field, a meteorologist with the county Air  Pollution Control District.  </P> <P> Low fog is expected to move in from the ocean today, pushing the smog out of  the eastern portion of the county area, Field said.  </P> <P> But one Simi Valley resident was not taking any chances.  </P> <P> "I've been inside all day, and I think this is where I'm going to stay," Summer  O'Neill, an 18-year-old clerk at the 7-Eleven store on Yosemite Street, said  Thursday. "The air looks almost blue-gray. It's gross."  </P> <P> ALERTS: A state panel has toughened standards on smog alerts. A3  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 3, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COMMENTARY;  </P> <P> PACIFIC SYMPHONY FIDDLES WHILE SUBSCRIBERS BURN  </P> <P> With less than a month before its next concerts, the Pacific Symphony still  doesn't know what the program is going to be.  </P> <P> Originally, music director Keith Clark was to lead the orchestra in Verdi's  Requiem on April 26 and 27 at the Orange County Performing Arts Center in Costa  Mesa. Soloists were to have included soprano Aprile Millo and mezzo-soprano  Dolora Zajic.  </P> <P> But in a move to balance its budget, the orchestra in February "postponed" the  Verdi work until next season, saving about $75,000, according to officials.  </P> <P> So who and what is going to be on the April concerts?  </P> <P> "Millo will appear, that's confirmed," says Louis G. Spisto, executive director  of the Santa Ana-based orchestra. But he does not seem to know what she will be  singing.  </P> <P> "Miss Millo and conductor Keith Clark are finalizing details of her portion of  the program, which will include Verdi arias," he says. "As far as Mr. Clark's  part of the program, I don't know. Schubert's Eighth (Symphony) and  (Stravinsky's) 'Petrouchka' have been mentioned."  </P> <P> Clark, for his part, refers all program inquiries back to the Pacific Symphony  administration.  </P> <P> What's going on?  </P> <P> In an era in which singers often know their contractual obligations years in  advance -- and the Pacific itself knows its next year's season virtually to the  last detail -- why are Pacific subscribers still in the dark about 3 weeks  before the concerts, and nearly 2 months after the Requiem was canceled?  </P> <P> Some insiders, who insist on anonymity, suggest that the delay represents the  last vestiges of a power struggle between Spisto and Clark -- which led to  Clark's removal as music director at the end of this season.  </P> <P> One theory goes that Clark is stalling a decision as long as possible to  embarrass Spisto and the orchestra.  </P> <P> Others more sympathetic to the founding music director suggest that he was  never consulted about the Requiem cancellation, feels justifiably hurt and  considers a piecemeal program of operatic arias a poor substitute for what was  originally announced.  </P> <P> There are even a few iconoclasts who will whisper in your ear that the great  Millo is not above playing her own diva games -- and is not helping matters  with her demands and choices of repertory.  </P> <P> No one knows the truth at this point.  </P> <P> But one thing is certain. So far no one is a winner in the situation: not the  subscribers, the public, Clark, Millo, Spisto or an orchestra that is trying to  augment its professional reputation.  </P> <P> Come on, guys, grow up.  </P> <P> Incidentally, Spisto says Zajic had agreed to postpone her appearance with the  orchestra until the 1990-91 season. But she is not listed among the soloists so  far announced for the season. The Verdi Requiem is not on the schedule either.  </P> <P> Stay tuned.  </P></p>

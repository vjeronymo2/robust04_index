			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / Clothing trade deficit 'at peak' BRITAIN'S trade deficit in clothing and textiles reached a record Pounds 3.8bn in 1992, almost one third of the total trade deficit, a report says today. Imports rose 7 per cent to Pounds 8.6bn as overseas manufacturers took advantage of the strength of sterling before it left the European exchange rate mechanism in September, says the report from the Apparel Knitting and Textiles Alliance, the industry body. The strongest rise in imports was in clothing - 18 per cent up in the final quarter compared with 1991. But the orders for those deliveries were placed before sterling's fall. Exports rose more slowly than imports but nevertheless reached a record of Pounds 4.8bn, up 6 per cent on 1991.</p>

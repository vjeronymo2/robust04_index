			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / Technology: Making friends with Big Blue - Alan Cane advises how to get the best out of an IBM partnership International Business Machines today depends on a diversity of 'business partners', small and entrepreneurial companies which provide the giant manufacturer with specialised products and services. There are already more than 20,000 of them and the total is growing daily. If they withdrew their co-operation simultaneously, Big Blue's Dollars 60bn (Pounds 40bn) plus global revenues would fall by at least 40 per cent. Despite IBM's troubles - it has not made a profit for the past two years, during which time a fifth of the workforce has left the organisation - it is still a magnet for smaller companies anxious to sell to its customers and benefit from its marketing muscle. Partnering IBM in the mid-1990s* was written for these companies. Its author, Michael Hillier, is optimistic that IBM will come through its present troubles and its business partners will benefit from its recovery. 'IBM is still a very large and complex organisation with massive financial and intellectual assets. It is still a dynamic corporate giant and should not be underestimated,' he writes. The problem for would-be IBM partners, as he sees it, is to get the best out of a decidedly testing relationship without being suffocated by Big Blue. Not all partnerships with IBM are successful. A broad agreement with the troubled Wang Laboratories failed after the smaller company apparently failed to meet sales targets set by IBM. 'How can you try to ensure that your partnership with IBM is not to be in the 'unsuccessful' percentage,' Hillier writes. 'The key for most IBM business partners will be to identify and understand IBM expectations of them and to identify and manage the risks attached to these expectations.' It helps to understand IBM's strategy for the future. The company is shifting focus from hardware to software and services. It will need partners to help it focus its efforts in markets which may be unfamiliar. A restraining force may be that IBM will want sole ownership of some areas - consultancy is a prime example - which in the past it would have been prepared to share. How should a potential partner optimise this strategy for its own benefit? 'Ensure IBM understands your product offering and agrees that it meets or adds value to a known IBM requirement,' Hillier suggests. He does not underestimate the difficulty of dealing with a company as large as IBM. Partnerships can fail even after a seemingly satisfactory agreement has been signed. The reasons are that in the end the potential partner is dealing with people rather than a corporation. There may be a failure of communication; IBM's culture has produced a set of internal manners, language and jargon which can be hard to understand. Discussions may be 'coded' because IBM has been used to negotiating only with itself. A second problem may be IBM's downsizing. Some 43,000 employees left the company in 1992 and there is no suggestion the exodus is at an end. Hillier warns: 'Ask yourself if the IBM employee or executive with whom you are negotiating will be there next week?' Equally, an IBM employee in a new job may lack the confidence and experience to take full responsibility for the negotiations. Finally, there may be a lack of trust between the potential partners. Culture clash or misunderstanding? It is important to find out quickly; IBM managers fight their corners hard but give full support once a decision is made. The advantages of becoming an IBM partner outweigh the risks, Hillier concludes. 'IBM will still be present in some form in the foreseeable future . . . it will almost certainly continue to be increasingly dependent on its partners to bring in a larger percentage of its business. This dependence should continue for as far as the eye can see'. *Partnering IBM in the mid-1990s, Haye Services, Sherborne St John, RG24 9HP. Pounds 690.</p>

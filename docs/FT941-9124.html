			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Speyhawk properties sold Receivers of Speyhawk, the developer that collapsed last May, have sold part of its portfolio to Scottish Amicable. The price paid was a fraction of the Pounds 110m loan that was secured on the portfolio. The value of Speyhawk's properties was hit extremely hard during the property downturn, because the properties included development sites and buildings only partly let. The portfolio included Prospect West, an office building in Croydon, The Corn Exchange, a shopping centre in Tunbridge Wells, the Bradley Stoke District Centre in Bristol and Weymouth Town Centre. Some properties in Brighton and some residential units financed using the loan were excluded. Mr Peter Spratt of Price Waterhouse said the sales had secured the long-term future of key developments.</p>

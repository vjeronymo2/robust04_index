			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Washington, February 2 (XINHUA) -- The U.S. Senate  today approved an authorization bill of 12.4 billion dollars for  fiscal years 1994 and 1995 for the State Department, the U.S.  Information Agency and the Peace Corps.    Attached to the bill, which was passed 92-8, were amendments  calling for the unilateral lifting of arms embargo against  Bosnia- Herzegovina and recommending the redeployment of  tactical nuclear weapons in South Korea if no major progress was  made in talks with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on  nuclear inspections.    Another amendment, passed last week, urges the Bill Clinton  administration to end a 19-year-old trade embargo on Vietnam.    The amendments are not legally binding.    Clinton said today he might make a decision on the embargo  in  a few days.    According to the Senate bill, which still has to be  reconciled with the House of Representatives, 900 million  dollars will be provided for peacekeeping missions over the  two-year period aside from an 175 million dollars requested for  an international peacekeeping contingency fund.    The Senate bill also called for:    -- The quick inclusion of East European countries in the  North Atlantic Treaty Organization as full members while  praising the "Partnership for Peace" Program.    -- Cuts of 10 percent and 20 percent respectively for 1994  and 1995 for U.S. contributions to the United Nations.    -- Blocking arms sales to countries that enforce the Arab  League boycott on U.S. companies that do business with Israel.</p>

			<p>Lithography   Equipment: Combined Use with Stepper Exhibits High  Productivity   <F P=102> 94FE0300A Tokyo NIKKEI MICRODEVICES in Japanese Dec 93 pp  120-126 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY </F>  <F P=103> 94FE0300A </F> <F P=104>  Tokyo NIKKEI MICRODEVICES </F> <F P=105>  Japanese </F> CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Toshio Kaneko, a member of the Implementation </F> Headquarters for Electronic Device Manufacturing System;  Yukinobu Shibata, Toshihide Kurosaki, and Katsuhiro Kawasaki,  members of the Instrumentation Division of the Implementation  Headquarters]    [Text] Hitachi has demonstrated the cost effectiveness of  electron beam (EB) direct-writers in mass production of  large-scale integrated (LSI) circuits. After evaluating with a  cost-of-ownership (COO) model, which formulated facility  investments and cost-effectiveness of their operations into  equations, the above conclusion was reached to dispel the  prejudice of LSI manufacturers that ``EB direct writers are too  expensive to be used in mass production of LSI circuits.''  According to this evaluation, DRAMs and ASICs [application  specific ICs] can be manufactured cheaper by hybrid usage of EB  direct writers and steppers than using steppers only.    The evaluation led to the following conclusions. Hybrid  usage  of steppers and EB direct writers, which are based on the  cell-projection technology, will be more cost effective for the  production of memories smaller than 0.25 micron. Also, the cost  of masks for steppers will unexpectedly increase for the  production of many varieties but small quantities of ASICs  smaller than 0.5 micron, and hence EB direct writers will become  more cost effective.  <H5>  [Introduction] </H5>   We have shown that memory chips smaller than 0.25 micron and  ASICs smaller than 0.5 micron can be manufactured cheaper by  hybrid usage of EB direct writers and steppers than using  steppers only. Also, we have confirmed that, to reduce the  manufacturing cost of LSI circuits, it is more effective to  improve throughput and MTBF [mean time between failure] rather  than reducing the price of EB direct writers. These conclusions  were obtained[.sup]1[/] through comparisons and evaluations  using an American COO model (Footnote 1) based on a cost of  ownership concept, which formulates facility investments and  cost-effectiveness of operations into equations.    Footnote 1. Formulas were mostly based on the COO model used  by SEMATECH of the United States, but a model recognized by an  academic society was used for portions specific to EB writers.  Mostly published data were used in the formulas. We asked for  the opinion of domestic manufacturers of LSI circuits and masks  other than Hitachi on the data on phase-shift masks, the KrF and  ArF excimer technology and on the data specific to EB writers  for comparison.    First, we briefly outline the COO model and the way EB  writers are used. Then, we show that hybrid usage of EB direct  writers and steppers are cost effective (a) in the mass  production of DRAMs and (b) in the large variety but small  quantity production of ASICs. Finally, we describe the  effectiveness of mask writers.  <H5>  Discussions Held on a Common Ground </H5>   A COO model uses equations to evaluate cost-effectiveness  based on the expenses of a certain equipment until its useful  life is reached. These expenses are calculated from the  equipment price, its productivity, reliability and yield. A COO  model derives the cost of each wafer manufactured.    The purpose of deriving such a COO value is to establish a  common ground for discussions between users and manufacturers by  unifying the evaluation standards for cost-effectiveness of  equipment and materials. The COO value can also be used as a  guideline for setting priorities in improving equipment or  selecting targets for cost reduction.    In the past, there was no unified model and the users and  manufacturers of an equipment used different methods to evaluate  the cost-effectiveness of the equipment. Hence sometimes they  failed to obtain an appropriate evaluation depending on what the  users wanted. However, the evaluation standards now can be  unified by using a COO model and its results, thus opening the  opportunity of discussing on a common ground (Footnote 2).    Footnote 2. One of the advantages of a COO model is that the  model can highlight problems inherent in an equipment or a  manufacturing line by changing evaluation parameters. For  instance, a model can identify the required balance between the  reliability and the price of an equipment, response to  manufacturing 8-inch wafers including the effect of the  equipment price, the relation between the depreciation of an  equipment and investment effectiveness, and the relation between  the appropriate number of equipment and the size of clean rooms.  <H5>  Three Ways to Use [EB Writers] </H5>   The usage of EB writers is divided into three broad  categories (Table 1):    (1) All layers are directly written by an EB writer;    (2) Hybrid usage with steppers (Footnote 3);    (3) Used only for making masks.       Table 1. Usage of EB writers. The usage of EB writers is divided into three  broad categories. The host materials mentioned in the table are those for  optical exposure.   Usage of EB writers         Objects to be        Amount to be      Methods to                              written              manufactured      be                                                                     compared   Mask writer                 Masks                Small amount   Reticles     Small amount   Laser writer    Direct       All EB         Mainly               Very small  writing      [writers]      state-of-the-art     amount (for                              devices              R&amp;D)   Direct       Gate arrays    Small amount (many   Mix-and-match  writing,                    types of host        among steppers  hybrid                      materials)  usage   Advanced     Small amount   Mix-and-match  gate         (many types    among steppers  arrays       of host               materials)   Memory       Large amount   Steppers,                              excimers, X-rays      In the conventional mix-and-match method (Editor's Footnote  1) among steppers, such as the g-line and i-line, high precision  steppers were used for critical layers but low-cost, high-speed  equipment were used for noncritical layers. As a result,  production cost was reduced. However, when the design rule is  shorter than 0.35 micron, difficulties remain in the overlapping  precision between steppers and the compensation for distorted  images. These difficulties can be solved by using method (2) in  which steppers are used for noncritical layers and EB direct  writers for critical layers.    Editor's Footnote 1: The method to mix-and-match steppers  has  aggressively been adopted by Hitachi. Few other companies use  this method.    In deriving a COO value, we have used the COO model  developed  by SEMATECH of the United States. We have adopted the standard  values used by SEMATECH as input data. For fair comparisons, we  asked for advice from other LSI and mask manufacturers on input  data for steppers, such as phase-shift masks and the KrF and ArF  excimer technology. All amounts were expressed in dollars, using  an exchange rate of &yen;100 to $1.    The obtained results conclude that hybrid usage of EB direct  writers, which are based on the cell-projection technology, is  cost-effective in manufacturing memory [chips with rules] under  0.25 micron, and EB direct writers are cost-effective in  manufacturing ASICs [with rules] under 0.5 micron. The actual  calculations of the COO values were carried out for mass  production of DRAMs, large variety but small quantity production  of ASICs, and for fabrication of masks.  <H5>  Hybrid Usage Is Cost-Effective for DRAMs </H5>   First of all, our study has clearly indicated that hybrid  usage is cost-effective for mass production of DRAMs (Figure 1).  The reason for this conclusion is that the price of an EB writer  does not change much even when very fine patterns are written,  while the price of a stepper rises sharply. Another reason is  that the cost of fabricating masks for phase shift masks and KrF  excimer masks increases because auxiliary masks are needed. The  basic parameters for hybrid usage are listed in Tables 2 and 3.  The COO values to manufacture DRAMs with 0.35 micron or smaller  [rules] using steppers rapidly increase, and the development  cost for steppers will increase to control the rising production  cost. In contrast, hybrid usage of EB writer based on the  cell-projection technology[.sup]6[/] is somewhat more  cost-effective than using only steppers. We assumed in our  calculation that optical exposure is possible down to 0.18  micron. In practice, however, [the development of] KrF excimer  stepper has not been completed and it is true that the outlook  for ArF-based laser technology is uncertain.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-020L-61A>      Figure 1.

A COO value for ASICs varies according to the quantity and type  of products, and we have used cases for the production of 50,000  and 1,000 units per months, and 60, 120 and 240 types of  products. The basic parameters are the same as those listed in  Table 3 for the case of 0.8-0.35 micron.    The variation of the COO value according to the type and  quantity of products is shown in Figure 2. With steppers, the  COO value barely changes even when the production quantity of a  given device varies. On the contrary, the type of products  affects the COO value very much; when the type of products  doubles the COO value also nearly doubles. From the figure, we  see that the COO value of an EB writer rises in proportion to  the production quantity, but the rise is small.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-020L-63A>      Figure 2. COO values as a function of the product types. </FIG>     Next, we illustrate in Figure 3 what should be the target of  an equipment manufacturer in trying to reduce its equipment  cost. Even if the equipment cost is reduced, its COO value  sharply increases when the throughput and MTBF [mean time  between failures] is reduced (Table 4). One cannot develop an  equipment without considering its throughput and MTBF. These  items are more important than reducing the price of an equipment  (Editor's Footnote 2).    Editor's Footnote 2: The research arm of Hitachi has  requested that the equipment price be under ``&yen;300 million''  in the future. (See a related article in the September 1993  issue of this magazine, pp. 54-59.)    <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-020L-63B>      Figure 3. COO value will increase if efficiency and the </FIG>         Table 4.

Our calculation  shows that the COO value can be reduced by maintaining the MTBF  if the rising equipment price is controlled.    The production quantity was assumed to be one wafer per lot,  and the equipment price and the MTBF were assumed to rise in  fabricating phase-shift masks. On the other hand, we also have  studied the case in which the rising price of an EB writer is  controlled and a decrease in the MTBF is prevented as part of a  company-wide effort (Table 5). The results for different  generations of memory chips are illustrated in Figure 4.       Table 5. Key parameters in mask fabrication. ``Equipment price 2'' in this  table and the second row of the MTBF entry represent trends to serve as  goals for an equipment manufacturer. ``[.sup]*1[/]'' indicates that  5-magnification reticles were assumed.

Results are </FIG>     In our evaluation, we used 5-magnification reticles, but it  becomes difficult to produce two pieces of 256M or 1G [memory  chips] with 5-magnification reticles. For this reason,  4-magnification reticles are being considered to prevent a  decrease in throughput. In either case, however, the decisive  factor in mask fabrication is how to prevent a decrease in  throughput.  <H5>  Unified Evaluation Standards for Cost-Effectiveness of </H5> Investments and Operations of Equipment    The cost of ownership (COO) is a modeling concept for  evaluation standards for the cost-effectiveness of facility  investments and operations at the management level. SEMATECH of  the United States is leading the development of the model.  <H5>  Background and History </H5>   The COO model originated from Intel Corporation of the  United  States in mid-eighties.[.sup]2[/] The Intel model was  developed to serve as a quantitative evaluation standard for  businesses in purchasing equipment. Later, this model was  transferred to SEMATECH and has contributed to the construction  of a model for the total production system. In 1991, the first  article on COO was reported by R. Carnes and M. Su.[.sup]3[/]    Their COO analysis software was distributed to more than 600  member companies of SEMATECH. Some LSI manufacturers are already  using the model as an effective evaluation means to select  equipment manufacturers. In addition, better training methods  are being developed to understand the content of the COO model  and to eliminate the differences between member companies, while  SEMI [Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International] is  standardizing the model.[.sup]4[/]     <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-020L-65A>      Figure A-1. Concept for COO calculation. Input parameters </FIG>     Items listed in Figure A-1 are used in calculating the COO  value. The ultimate goal is to form steps shown in Figure A-2 as  the total-cost model and incorporate it into the COO analysis.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-020L-65B>      Figure A-2. Total-cost model. The final goal is to form </FIG>   <H5>  Computational Method of the COO Model Proposed by SEMATECH </H5>   The cost per wafer, $COO, is calculated from SEMATECH's COO  model according to the following equation[.sup]3[/]:   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-020L-65C>      EQUATION </FIG>     Here, $F are the fixed costs, which include the cost of  acquiring equipment, transportation cost, startup cost,  installation cost and facility cost; $V are the variable costs,  which include the cost of chemicals, gas, water and electricity,  materials cost, labor cost (operating cost, technical fees,  etc.), repair cost and the cost of consumables; L is the  equipment life (depreciation life, technical life, usage life);  TPT is the throughput (wafers/hour); Y(TPT) is the average yield  of the equipment that affect throughput (throughput yield); U is  the utilization rate (according to the definition E10-92 by  SEMI, actual production time/effective time); and $Y are the  yield loss costs.    This model accepts a wide range of input parameters. The  model includes fixed costs ($F), such as the depreciation of the  cost of acquiring equipment and facility cost. All depreciation  periods are five years. Some of the input parameters are closely  tied to production lines which must be clearly separated from  the financial parts.  <H5>  Equipment Yield and Yield Loss Costs </H5>   The yield loss costs caused by defects are related to the  average number of defects per wafer, the cost of scrapping  defective wafers and the number of defective chips per wafer  according to the following equation:    $Y=[W(TPT)x$P]+[W(D)x$T],    where W(TPT) is the number of defective wafers based on the  throughput yield, W(D) is the number of defective wafers based  on the defect limiting yield (losses beyond the limits of the  defect density), $P is the cost of a wafer at the processing  stage, and $T is the cost of test wafers.    The value of W(D) in the yield model is determined from the  following equation:   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-020L-65D>      EQUATION </FIG>     Here, R is the number of wafers inserted per week, D is the  physical defect density, L is the equipment life (week), A is  the chip size (cm[.sup]2[/]), and P(f) is the loss  probability. This probability, P(f), is the fraction of the  critical pattern size within a chip area expressed as follows:    P(f)=X(m)[.sup]2[/]/[W(W+P)],    where X(m) is the minimum defect size, W is the minimum line  width of the minimum gap between lines (micron), and P is the  pitch (micron). These parameters depend on the process, the  device type and the wafer diameter.  <H5>  Production Utilization Rate </H5>   The COO model is based on the total cost per wafer at the  actual production time. In Figure B, we present the guidelines  for the equipment status and time for E10-92 at  SEMI.[.sup]5[/] According to the figure, the production  utilization rate U is given by:    U=1-(SM+USM+TEST+TA+STBY)/168,    where SM is the scheduled maintenance time (hour/week); USM  is the unscheduled maintenance time (hour/week); TEST is the  production testing time (hour/week); TA is the total time  (hour/week) for temporary assistance, such as an unexpected  stopping of equipment that can be recovered in less than six  minutes by human intervention; and STBY is the time needed for  preparation. The following items are included in the scheduled  and unscheduled maintenance time: MTBF which stands for the  production time/number of failures; MTTR [maximum time to  repair] which stands for the total repair time/number of  failures; MTBA [mean time between assistance] which stands for  the production time/number of [maintenance] assistance; and MTTA  [mean time to accomplish] which stands for the average time for  performing assistance.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-020L-66A>      Figure B. Equipment status and time. </FIG>     Throughput is an important component in a COO model.  Throughput is affected by the MTBF, MTTR, MTBA, MTTA and the  production testing time. For instance, the throughput for and EB  [writer] is calculated from the above parameters and the time  for job setup, the time for loading and unloading of a wafer,  stage transfer time, alignment time and the number of shots.    The maintenance cost is small, but plays an important role  in  the total wafer cost. The costs for which most attention should  be paid are unscheduled maintenances, service contracts, spare  parts, tests not covered under warranty and labor costs for  repairs.  References    1.

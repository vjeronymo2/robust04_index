			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Rachid Drif: "GIA (Armed Islamic Group), The </F> First Circle"]    [Text] The name Si-Ahmed Mourad, alias  "Djaafer El Afghani," appears for the first time in the airport  case indictment. But he was not convicted in absentia, nor was  he on the list of 57 accused alongside Hocine Abderrahim.    On 26 August 1992, at 0900, two men in a red Renault 4 left  Bouzareah heading for Houari Boumediene airport. They had just  been to the domicile of Fenouh Karim, who gave them a sack  containing a voluminous package. At the wheels of the vehicle  was one Boulesbaa Youcef, a veteran of Mustapha Bouyali's MIA  [Armed Islamic Movement] sought by police in the mid-1980's and  later amnestied along with Chebouti, Meliani, the Baa brothers,  Hattab, Moghni.    Accompanying Boulesbaa was a certain Djaafar el Afghani,  whose mission was to deposit the sack provided by Fenouh in the  airport concourse. A very powerful bomb that was to detonate at  1100. Boulesbaa's job was to telephone airport officials and  warn them to have the waiting area evacuated.    At the trial of the Abderrahim group, the  indictment--prepared from the interrogations conducted by police  and intelligence services, the depositions having been turned  over to the magistrate handling the case--contained two  different versions of the facts.    First, the confessions of Said Soussene and Meliani  Mansouri,  arrested before the 26 August attack; second, those of the group  subsequently arrested.    The indictment also includes, besides the interrogation  reports, two essential documents: a synthesis that includes the  organization table of the MIA and names the principal leaders of  the terrorist cells; and a concluding section that relates the  facts, identifies who was responsible for which crimes in the  airport affair, and describes the composition of the armed  groups of Chebouti's Islamic movement.    In the synthesis, it is noted that in addition to the MIA,  four large groups were active in the Algiers area: the crisis  unit responsible for "continuing the political activities of the  Islamic front," headed by Redjam, Cherrati, and Said; the "ala  al ahd bakoune" (faithful to the oath) movement of Selmane  Abassi; and finally two very dangerous groups specializing in  asassination of prominent personalities and agents of the  security forces: one headed by Allal Mohamed, alias "Leveilley",  the other led by Djaafar el Afghani.    The first document identifies the man who placed the bomb as  being Zouaoui Djaafar, alias "El-Afghani," who attended one of  the first preparatory meetings for the 26 August attack at the  home of Boulesbaa in El-Mohammadia, near El-Harrach. Besides  Boulesbaa, there were the two Hocine brothers, Abderrahim and  Ahmed. However, Zouaoui was not among those indicted, nor was he  called as a witness before the special court, nor did his name  appear in the list of accomplices in hiding. To this day, his  name does not even appear on the list of 22,000 activists being  sought by the security forces....    The second document, the conclusion of the indictment  supported by a reconstruction of the facts, identifies this same  Djaafar el Afghani who planted the explosive device at Dar  El-Beida as being Si-Ahmed Mourad, a friend of airport ground  mechanic Mechrouk Mohamed, who advised the Abderrahim group.    Mechrouk was not prosecuted either, and doubtless has fled.  Hocine Abderrahim has used confusion engendered by the  indictment to sow seeds of doubt. The judge made efforts  throughout the trial to establish the identity of Zouaoui  Djaafar "el Afghan" and his relationship to members of the group.    Abderrahim, who knew that Si-Ahmed alias Zouaoui and Djaafar  El Afghani had not been properly identified--the pseudonym  Zouaoui confused the trail--went so far as to bluff the judge by  asserting that Djaafar El Afghani was an imaginary personage  whom he had invented while being tortured.    Soussene Said, arrested on 18 August, about a week before  the  attack, testified he had met Si-Ahmed Zikioui Brahim, an  important member of the Leveilley group, at the latter's home in  Baraki. Soussene admitted to his companions that he was the  instigator of the bomb attacks against ENTV and the police  security office for the wilaya of Algiers. It was at that  meeting that Si-Ahmed proposed planting a bomb in the control  tower of Boumediene International Airport.  <H5>  Armed Islamic Group </H5>   Al Jamaa al islamia al moussalaha, GIA [Armed Islamic  Group],  born after the uprising of June 1991, was the creation of  Mansouri Meliani, a former Bouyali henchman sentenced to death  by the state security court, then amnestied by the regime under  pressure from Islamists and the FIS [Islamic Salvation Front].    Meliani was born in December 1944 in Khemis El Khechna--he  would have been 50 this year--into a modest family of the  region. He lived--before the era of the first MIA--in a small  dwelling in the Bougara development at Sidi-Moussa. On being  released, he made contact with FIS militants and officials. In  early 1991, he was given lodgings by Zermane Omar at Amroussa,  in Mitidja. Omar, a construction materials merchant, is a  habitual criminal well-known to the police. He was part of Allal  Mohamed's very first group and prepared hide-outs in the region  for them. It was he who built Allal's main hide-out at Harraza  on land purchased by the latter from proceeds of several  hold-ups committed in metropolitan Algiers. Meliani, who had no  resources, received gifts from Islamists in Algiers: Islamic  Front militants gave him lots of money, as did Nahnah. Salah  Assad offered him land at Soumaa.    After the June disturbances, Meliani decided to create his  own armed group, modeled on the MIA of the 1980s. He called it  the GIA, and its governing body was a select Majlis Echoura  [advisory council] with himself as emir. The council consisted  of six persons: Kaouane Hacene, the "chaabi" singer; Bourahli  Saadane, Meliani's brother-in-law; Nacer El Eulmi, brother of  the founder of the SIT [Islamic Labor Syndicate]; Lahrani Sid  Ahmed, a notorious terrorist with close ties to Allal; the imam  of Ouled Yaiche; and a certain Abderrahmane of Benzerga.    The group mounted several operations, including the  "admiralty" attack, but was rapidly dismantled after Meliani was  arrested in July 1992 in El-Achour, Bouyali's old fiefdom. The  same month Zermane was arrested, along with El Hani, a funds  collector and agent of Allal, and Hamadache, mufti of the  Mitidja group. They gave away the entire composition of the  band, while Meliani played straight with the authorities and  reconstructed his network of contacts for investigators.    When Allal was killed in September of the same year, the  security services quickly deduced that Layada Abdelhaq would  become leader of the band's survivors. In six months, 29 very  dangerous members of the network were arrested or killed. Layada  was "coordinating" several very different cells, but above all  he was quite close to Allal. After several months of total  silence, communiques were published in the newspaper EL HAYAT in  which Layada, writing under the pseudonym of Abou Adlane,  claimed to be leading several armed groups that henceforth would  form the GIA. In June 1993 he was arrested in Morocco and  extradited to Algiers in greatest secrecy. Actually,  investigators wanted to exploit to the maximum the information  he provided before publicly announcing his arrival in Algiers.  <H5>  Third Generation </H5>   The Armed Islamic Group pursued a sanguinary strategy in  1993. After bomb attacks, murders of security officers, and  attacks on patrols and barracks, even civilians were targeted,  especially after the marches against violence and terrorism.  Intellectuals and journalists were targeted. Si Mourad, alias  Djaafar El Afghani, once again figured in police reports, and  information about him was collected when lesser terrorists were  nabbed.    Initial conclusions of investigators: He is a very important  figure, and cross-checking indicates he instigated the failed  attack on Khaled Nezzar. His name keeps popping up in connection  with headline-news events such as the attack on Boughzoul  barracks; it is linked with a subject named Hammana, arrested  and later released in 1992, and with Sayah Attia, 38, the son of  a harki [Algerian who served with French forces during the war  for liberation] and a cold-blooded killer in his own right; and  with Tamesguida, where 12 Croats were slaughtered in cold blood.  A new element appears in the modus operandi: GIA terrorists have  begun killing with knives: They slit their victims' throats,  decapitate them, and mutilate the bodies....    Soon, there were other new targets: foreigners. Si Ahmed  masterminded the abduction of three French consular agents, then  had aid cooperators and residents of various nationalities  "executed." Industrialists and small merchants were victimized  with increasing frequency, and there was little the security  services could do about it.    With the passing of Meliani and Layada from the scene, GIA's  leadership has passed to a third "generation." Djaafar  El-Afghani's group specializes in kidnapping-murders--as for  instance in the case of Cheikh Bouslimani, who was found buried  with his throat slit, next to an officer who had been kidnapped  and decapitated. And there have been dozens more civilians. On  Saturday, the hard core of the GIA was brought down--certainly,  too, what the specialists call the "first circle": leaders of  cells, very active members. What remains, according to this  theory of the counterterrorism struggle, are the second and  third circles: the thugs and killers, as well as the support  groups that shelter the terrorists, provide information, and  collect funds before being promoted and starting a new cell.    Djaafar's progress is a case in point. At age 28--he was  born  in January 1964--he was a small-time operative of the MIA.  Eighteen months later, this young musician born in Kouba and  raised in Tablat had become the leader of one of Algiers's most  murderous gangs.</p>

			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Books: Away from Lake Wobegon - JDF Jones finds Garrison Keillor allowing his irreverent imagination to take flight THE BOOK OF GUYS by Garrison Keillor Faber Pounds 14.99, 340 pages Garrison Keillor is always being described as the funniest writer in America today, but be warned, he is not everyone's cup of tea. His new collection of a score of stories and scripts, The Book of Guys, exposes his weaknesses as well as his strengths, and confirms that he takes a big risk when he turns his back on his home base, the wonderfully named Lake Wobegon. Keillor was - is - a radio broadcaster of genius who over eight years has published half-a-dozen collections in which the anecdotes are often framed in a first-person reminiscence of small-town life in Minnesota. They are all available in Faber paperback and newcomers might as well start with the first, Lake Wobegon Days, in which the gazetteer footnote on page 1 records that 'bleakly typical of the prairie, Lake Wobegon has its origins in the utopian vision of 19th-century New England Transcendalists but now is populated mainly by Norwegians and Germans'. Keillor then adds, in his lean, pleasing style, that 'a breeze off the Lake brings a sweet air of mud and rotting wood, a slight fishy smell, and picks up the sweetness of old grease, a sharp whiff of gasoline, fresh tires, spring dust, and, from across the street, the faint essence of tuna hotdish at the Chatterbox Cafe . . .' From the beginning, Keillor has been playing with nostalgia, and therefore with sentiment; harking back constantly to the intensity and the embarrassments of adolescence ('He had never liked beer. Beer parties were big deals at school: twenty carloads of students out at an abandoned granite quarry, a beer keg in every trunk, radios blasting, and beautiful women careening into the bushes to throw up'); risking the corny, straw-chewing, folksy wisdom ('Luck lies in not getting what you thought you wanted but getting what you have, which once you have it you may be smart enough to see is what you would have wanted had you known'). All these dangerous inclinations have been redeemed by wit ('He made a list of experiences he thought he should have in order to become a writer. He left No. 1 blank for fear his mother might see it. No. 2 was Europe; No. 3 was despair . . .'). (I apologise for all these parentheses but it is difficult to convey the flavour of Keillor without resorting to excessive quotation.) The Book of Guys is not set in Lake Wobegon, but Minnesota still features prominently, with diversions to South Dakota, Maine, a venomously described Vermont, President Bush's DC, and Heaven, from which the cowboy Lonesome Shorty sends his sad story. The linking theme is that 'guys are in trouble. Guys are gloomy . . .' The fault lies in monogamy, and in particular in the nature of women in this feminist age ('A monogamous man is like a bear riding a bicycle: he can be trained to do it but he would rather be in the woods, doing what bears do.') So it is no surprise that 'Guy Pride' is sweeping the US - and here Keillor has great fun with the 'Wild Man' antics of (real-life) poet Robert Bly and his imitators, not least in a monologue by Al Denny, the absent-minded, best-selling New Age author of Being The Person You Are and Re-birthing The Me You Used To Be. Truth to tell, this is a curate's egg of a collection, by which I mean that some of the episodes should never have seen the light of day, particularly a cute anecdote about two mice and a dubious tale of a missionary's son who catches leprosy from an African toilet seat. Some are Over The Top (eg 'Christmas In Vermont'); some are too tricky for Keillor to pull off (Zeus as a Lutheran pastor). Others are more successful: Dionysus at 50 discovering that he has run out of immortality; the injured football hero who runs happily to fat; Earl Grey, 'the only living American to have a popular beverage named after him, Dr David Pepper having passed away a few years before'). Which reminds us that Keillor stands or falls as a humorous writer and deserves to be rated in a distinguished tradition that includes Thurber: it is no coincidence that he appears in the New Yorker. The wisecrack is part of the tradition - as in 'Seduction is a mutual endeavour in which I conspire with a woman to give her an opening to do what she wants to do without reminding her that this goes against her principles'. Or the deadly parody - for instance, President Bush reacting to the invasion of Chicago by the barbarian Huns: 'The President is in charge, Bob. That's part of the job. I think that people who think the President is not in charge are going to have a very big surprise coming. I don't want to say what it is.' Thirdly, there is an American delight in exaggeration taken in a logical progression to absurdity - Catch 22 is a sustained example - and Keillor has this gift of allowing an irreverent imagination to take flight. Thus, of travelling First Class: 'The flight attendants wore gold-paisley sarongs slit up the side and pink-passion lipstick, they were Barnard graduates (cum laude) in humanities, and they set a vase of fresh roses on my table, along with the seviche and salmon loaf and crab puffs with Mornay sauce, and they leaned over me, their perfect college-educated breasts hanging prettily in place, and they whispered, 'You've got a nice butt. You ever read Kant?'' Is that funny? Isn't it? Up to a point, Lord Copper.</p>

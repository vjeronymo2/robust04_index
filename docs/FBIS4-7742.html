			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Katalin Antaloczy: "Exports' Nosedive. A Failing </F> Sector"]    [Text] Bela Kadar, minister of international economic  relations, could not have rated Hungary's foreign trade sector a  "success" even if he had been wearing his rosiest spectacles at  his briefing last week. He was forced to announce that, after  two years of continuous increases, Hungarian exports plunged  into a nosedive in 1993. Experts had already been predicting  that change. To a large extent the minister attributed it to the  fact that Hungarian economic policy has not been sufficiently  "international economy-friendly." However, a retrospective  analysis covering the preceding years shows that the policy  itself has not been sufficiently "economy-friendly."    The value of Hungary's exports last year was $8.9 billion.  In  comparison with 1992, that was 16.8-percent lower in terms of  foreign exchange, and nearly 10 percent lower in terms of  volume. At the same time the value of imports rose considerably,  by about 13 percent overall, to a total of $12.5 billion. Thus  the balance of trade based on statistics compiled by the Customs  Service (it includes all goods entering and leaving Hungary)  showed a deficit of $3.6 billion for 1993. Even after deducting  the items not involved in commercial transactions, this burdened  the balance of trade by about $2.3 billion.    Last year, then, the contradiction that had existed during  the preceding three years between the domestic economy's rapidly  deteriorating performance on the one hand and foreign trade's  improving performance on the other was resolved. Between 1990  and 1992, the shrinking economy produced increasing dollar  earnings, despite the forced switching of markets and the  collapse of trade with East Europe. Special domestic and  external conditions stimulated and made possible the growth of  exports during this period. The narrowing of the domestic and  Eastern markets led to increased sales to developed countries;  the boom in the West, together with the related partial opening  of Western markets and the economic-diplomacy moves (from the  beginning of 1990 the EC granted Hungary import preferences  under the Generalized System of Preferences, then Hungary  concluded a Europe Agreement with the EC and subsequently an  association agreement with the EFTA [European Free Trade  Association]), made those increased sales to developed countries  possible. Ownership posed hardly any obstacle to unprofitable  exports and the squandering of assets.    Parallel with switching markets, however, there was no move  toward a more efficient and more competitive export structure.  To the contrary, the structure of Hungarian exports took a  definite turn for the worse in 1991 and 1992. First, the two  commodity division (sources of energy, and materials and  components), for the production of which conditions in Hungary  are certainly not more favorable than elsewhere due to the  paucity of natural resources and the capital intensity of  production, and whose rising transportation costs to greater  distances set rigorous constraints on the expansion of supply,  maintained their stable share of exports at about 40 percent.    Furthermore, the proportion of customs processing within  Hungarian exports rose sharply in those years in comparison with  1990. A whole range of domestic economic players--particularly  in light industry, but also at many engineering and chemical  enterprises as well--had undertaken the custom processing of  other countries' materials, primarily for German firms, to load  their own unused capacities and to provide work for their  employees. (In 1992, the proportion of custom processing in the  textile and clothing industry was 90 percent of its total  exports.) However, this activity is not very economical; it does  not make investment possible and therefore provides no  opportunity for advancing beyond custom processing. The market  for custom processing strongly depends on the international  business cycle and is characterized by ever stiffer price and  cost competition among the countries of East Europe. Therefore  the increase in exports based on custom processing lacked a  solid foundation and stemmed mostly from necessity.    Usually the proportion of machinery exports is regarded as a  measure of an economy's competitiveness. The proportion of  machinery within Hungary's exports dropped significantly after  1990; with the sharp contraction of export opportunities to  Eastern markets, Hungary's engineering industry had only  moderate success in marketing its low-technical products in  developed countries.    Agriculture and the food industry jointly account for about  a  quarter of Hungary's exports. In spite of the changes underway,  however, large volumes of standardized products, often merely of  inferior quality, (bread grains, meat products of a low order of  processing, and wines in bulk, for instance) remained typical  also in the 1990's. But this export structure is too  capital-intensive for production conditions in Hungary. Like  custom processing, it is very sensitive to the business cycle,  and its economic efficiency is low.    The roots to the decline of exports since the end of 1992  and  the beginning of 1993 lie in the absence of structural change.  Uneconomical production and sales manifested themselves in  liquidity crises among businesses, resulting in mass  bankruptcies because of the strict regulations. The tightening  of monetary policy as of 1992, the abolition of prefinancing for  exports, the shortcomings in the system of export guaranties,  and recession in the West further aggravated the economic  players' impossible situation. Cutbacks, one of the tendencies  necessary for structural change, accelerated from the second  half of 1992. (In 1992, for instance, farm output fell by 22 or  23 percent, and the food industry's output by 13 percent.) A  significant proportion of the large exporters underwent  transformation; a part--and in some instances all--of their  stocks of exportable commodities disappeared. Presumably the  economic players' exports will not cease entirely after the  bankruptcy proceedings and liquidations, and only the  uneconomical exports will drop out. Consequently, the decline of  exports in 1993 was a normal development. The main question  today is what was actually at the bottom of last year's  processes, of the significant decline in exports and the growth  in imports. Was the worsening of the balance of trade a natural  symptom of the commencement of economic growth, of the  intensification of investment activity, and hence of structural  change? Or was it a sign of the Hungarian economy's continuing  slump?    Last year the export of energy sources showed the highest  rate of rise, nearly 30 percent (based on figures for the first  10 months). Materials, sources of energy, and electricity  together accounted for nearly 42 percent of Hungary's total  exports in 1993. In relation to a very low basis of comparison,  even machinery exports showed an increase of about 10 percent  overall. However, that average conceals a drop of about 15  percent in shipments to developed countries, and the near  doubling of machinery purchases by the former socialist  countries. (Though not evident from the statistics, it may be  assumed that the reexportation of aircraft brought in from  Lithuania for repairs played a substantial role in the latter's  increase. In the classical sense, however, such repairs cannot  be regarded as Hungarian machinery exports.) Significant  structural changes can already be perceived behind the  engineering industry's shrinking export sales: the exports of  products that once were traditional export items (buses, farm  machinery, and machine tools) are declining, while the exports  of several new commodity groups (cars and their subassemblies,  for instance) are rising.    Three commodity groups--custom processing, bread grains, and  food-industry products--played the decisive role in export's  sharp decline last year. They jointly accounted for 77 percent  of the overall decline. The drastic, more than 50-percent, drop  in the export of custom processing is not surprising on the  basis of what has been said above, but it is the more surprising  in the light of available statistics. To wit, the value of  materials brought into Hungary for customs processing last year  was the same as in 1992. Consequently, on that basis and even  with allowances for slippages in meeting shipping schedules,  also the value of custom processing exported in 1993 should have  developed roughly on the same level as in 1992. As an incentive  to undertake customs processing, the requirement to pay duty on  consumption entries with drawback privileges was abolished as of  1 January 1993, in response to strong pressure from the Ministry  of International Economic Relations. By now it is already  evident that this change in the regulations is being widely  abused: Materials brought in duty-free for custom processing  simply "vanish" into domestic consumption. The deep crisis in  agriculture and the food industry played the decisive role in  the decline of these exports. This is clearly evident from the  fact that last year, just as in 1992, the internal confusion and  shortages of stocks of exportable commodities in agriculture and  the food industry prevented domestic producers from taking full  advantage even of the export opportunities provided by our  Europe agreement.    Overall, the structure of exports did not change  significantly in 1993 as compared with its previous structure.  For the time being, the minor changes are mostly indications of  cutbacks. In principle, however, the sharp rise in  imports--consisting predominantly of machinery imports--could be  perceived as an indication of the commencement of "recovery."  But closer examination reveals that last year's import surplus  in machinery was mostly a one-time occurrence, and that its  purpose was not the modernization of production. To wit,  machinery imports included about $100 million worth of repairs  of Lithuanian aircraft (this item in itself represents an  increase of about $40 million over 1992), deliveries of Russian  combat materiel to offset earlier Hungarian claims, and the two  Boeings purchased by MALEV [Hungarian Airlines]. Increasing  purchases of internal combustion engines further augmented  machinery imports. The causes of these increasing purchases were  three-fold. Environmental-friendly DAF [Van Doorn Automobile  Factory] engines for the buses being built for the BKV [Budapest  Transportation Enterprise] accounted for the bulk of the  increased purchases. Furthermore, export orders for buses  increasingly specify foreign-made engines in them. Finally, the  development of production at the Suzuki factory is also  increasing the import of internal combustion engines.    Only an extremely small part of machinery imports--slight  increases in imports of food-industry, farm, and lumber-industry  machinery and of communications equipment--can be linked at all  to investment activity. Energy and material imports more closely  associated with economic growth continued to abate in 1993. The  significant rise in imports of petroleum products can be  attributed to scheming in conjunction with the supply of  household fuel oil rather than to a "kick-start" of the economy.  From the development of imports in 1993, in other words, it is  not yet possible to infer economic growth.    According to the briefing provided by the minister of  international economic relations, the earlier unfavorable  processes slowed down during the fourth quarter of last year.  But the casual observer is perplexed when attempting to identify  the cause of this improvement. Was it due to the customary  "year-end rush," to expectations of a devaluation, or to the  suitable grouping of the data over time? However, one thing is  certain: The improvement definitely was not due to the  export-incentive package plan the government adopted last  September. That decision did not mean measures that took effect  and made themselves felt immediately. It is safe to say that  nothing of that plan was implemented by 31 December 1993, with  the exception of the forint's slight devaluation which,  incidentally, was not even included in the package plan's  proposal. To this day the prefinancing of exports remains  unsolved, an Eximbank has not been established, and the rate of  corporate income tax will be reduced only as of the beginning of  1994.    The indicators for 1993 still reflect economic  hedge-hopping.  It is indisputable that the commencement of economic growth can  be expected only from a rise in profitable export, and that in  its turn is closely related to the general state of the economy.  Today the stimulation of exports cannot be imagined solely on  the basis of economic-diplomacy or trade-policy measures, for it  is obvious that neither agriculture and the food industry nor  the custom processors have been able to take full advantage of  the opportunities that the Europe agreement provided. On the  other hand, it would be essential to conduct several  investigations for a feasibility study of a larger-scale (real)  devaluation of the forint that numerous economic players and  experts have frequently been demanding. We ought to know, for  instance, whether the forint is truly undervalued or happens to  be overvalued. How elastic is the response of exports and  imports to a forint devaluation. How large is the imports  content of exports. And how does devaluation affect the price-  and cost-competitiveness of exports, and domestic inflation. In  other words, does forint devaluation do more good than harm.    In the case of a devaluation for the purpose of stimulating  export, we should take into consideration also the fact that  this tool helps only those who already are exporting, but it  hardly helps new players to enter the market. The frequently  voiced argument that a larger devaluation would enhance the  price-competitiveness of custom processing raises the question  as to whether Hungary could afford to enter into cutthroat  competition with its neighbors for custom processing, to regain  its markets on this basis, and then to continue an export that  has no future.    Because of the deep structural causes underlying the decline  of exports, it is very unlikely that even a significant change  in the exchange rate could substantially boost the export  volume. A growth in exports can be expected only from an  improvement in the general state of the economy--in other words,  only in the long run. That improvement can be brought about only  by an economic policy that, within the framework of budgetary  reform, reduces the burden of taxes and social-insurance  contributions, and thereby increases the resources available for  investment, improves enterprises' efficiency, accelerates  privatization, aids the entry of new exporters into the market,  and creates order in the agricultural economy. It would be  illusory to expect rapid improvement within a short time.</p>

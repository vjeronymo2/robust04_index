			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OIL PRICES FALL ON PEACE HOPES AND OPEC PLANS;  </P> <P> ENERGY: WHOLESALE COSTS OF HEATING OIL AND UNLEADED GASOLINE ALSO FALL AS A  SHOOTING WAR IN THE PERSIAN GULF SEEMS LESS LIKELY.  </P> <P> An OPEC accord to boost oil production and suspicions that a negotiated  settlement may resolve the Persian Gulf crisis sent crude oil prices sharply  down Wednesday to the lowest levels of the week.  </P> <P> Wholesale prices for home heating oil and unleaded gasoline also fell.  </P> <P> Analysts warned, however, that prices could swiftly rebound if hopes for peace  evaporate.  </P> <P> The price of the benchmark U.S. crude, West Texas Intermediate, for October  delivery fell $1.96 to close at $25.92 a barrel on the New York Mercantile  Exchange, 19% lower than the highest closing price last week. Last week's high  -- the Aug. 23 close of $32.05 -- was the highest price in five years. November  crude finished at $25.82 on Wednesday, down $1.58 a barrel.  </P> <P> Wednesday's selloff was the second sharp price drop of the week. On Monday, the  price of crude for October delivery fell about $4 a barrel on perceptions that  tensions in the Middle East were being reduced. The price rebounded Tuesday by  97 cents.  </P> <P> Prices for futures contracts -- deals for future delivery -- had jumped  dramatically after Iraq invaded oil-rich Kuwait on Aug. 2. The international  boycott of crude from Iraq and Kuwait has kept about 4 million barrels a day  off world markets.  </P> <P> To cover shortages created by the crisis, the Organization of Petroleum  Exporting Countries agreed to let cartel members boost output to prevent the  kind of oil price jumps that might endanger the global economy. The agreement  frees big producers such as Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, which have the capacity  to substantially boost production. Saudi Arabia is expected to increase its  output by about 2 million barrels a day and Venezuela by 350,000 to 500,000  barrels a day.  </P> <P> Some of the other 13 OPEC members -- Nigeria and the United Arab Emirates, for  example -- also are expected to raise production. As a result, an additional 3  million to 3.5 million barrels will be produced daily, oil analysts say.  </P> <P> "The market is calmer now that OPEC is making more crude available," said  Randall Rothenberg, a broker at Dean Witter International Energy Futures in New  York. "Unless there are hostilities in the Gulf, another sharp upturn (in  prices) is unlikely."  </P> <P> The drop in oil prices was impelled in part by a New York newspaper report that  Iraq has made a secret offer to the United States to withdraw from Kuwait in  exchange for certain concessions, analysts said. Newsday on Wednesday reported  that Iraq last week offered to withdraw and free Western hostages in exchange  for guaranteed access to the Persian Gulf, control of the Rumailah oil field  that juts into Kuwait and removal of U.N. sanctions.  </P> <P> In addition, traders were calmed by Iraq's announcement of plans for releasing  foreign women and children held in Kuwait and Iraq, market observers said.  </P> <P> "There is a perception in the public and in the oil community that the chances  of a shooting war are diminishing," said Thomas Burns, a San Francisco-based  economist at Chevron Corp. "There is a glimmer of hope that there will be a  resolution to the crisis."  </P> <P> Burns said some oil companies, fearing armed conflict between Iraq and a  multinational contingent based in Saudi Arabia, began to import more crude  earlier this month. The increase in imports was to build up inventories in case  an outbreak of war damages oil fields or cuts off access, he said.  </P> <P> The American Petroleum Institute late Tuesday reported that the stock of crude  in the U.S. rose 942,000 barrels, to 376.6 million, for the week ended Aug. 24.  The buildup surprised and reassured traders, prompting more selling of oil  futures, said Thomas Bentz, director of trading at the New York-based United  Energy Inc.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, the wholesale price of unleaded gasoline for October delivery  fell a steep 3.81 cents to 84.72 cents a gallon. Home heating oil fell 7.88  cents to 71.64 cents per gallon on September contracts.  </P></p>

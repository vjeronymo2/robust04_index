			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- Two days after the European Union  [EU] summit in Corfu the Federal Government has started  exploratory talks to present a generally acceptable candidate  for the succession of EU Commission President Jacques Delors in  time for the special summit in Brussels on 15 July. After the  meeting of the leading Christian Democratic Union bodies in Bonn  on Monday [27 June], Chancellor Helmut Kohl said that now he  will start his "efforts" to find a candidate who is acceptable  to all 12 member states. At the Corfu summit Belgian Prime  Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene, who was supported by 11 member  countries, failed to be elected because of Great Britain's veto.    The chancellor must settle the conflict, since Germany will  take over the EU Council presidency from Greece on 1 July. The  veto of British Prime Minister John Major met largely with  approval in London, also among the opposition and in the  Conservative Party, which is deeply split concerning European  issues. The Dutch Government is annoyed because Kohl and French  President Francois Mitterrand supported Dehaene, and thus did  not give Dutch Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers a chance to become  the new Commission president.    Kohl is still firmly determined to present Delors' successor  at the constituting session of the European Parliament on 19  July. The chancellor did not comment on whether Bonn and Paris  will continue to support Dehaene. In Corfu Major had said  concerning Dehaene: "We will not agree today, tomorrow, or in  four weeks."    On Monday, government spokesman Dieter Vogel explained that  the Federal Government will try "intensively" to find a  candidate who is acceptable to everyone. The chancellor and  Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel (Free Democratic Party of Germany)  will sound out the situation in many talks with other EU members  over the next few weeks. Asked whether Bonn has distanced  itself from Dehaene, Vogel said: "Just wait a bit. I cannot  see that the candidate of the 11 is not a suitable candidate,  except for the government of one country."</p>

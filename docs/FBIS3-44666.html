It has now been decided  that among the outgoing officials are Li Youwei, party secretary  and mayor of the city; Li Zhuanfang (female) and Li Guangzhen,  vice mayors; Yang Guanghui, member of the Standing Committee of  Shenzhen CPC Committee and head of the propaganda department;  and Liang Dajun, member of the Standing Committee of Shenzhen  CPC Committee and head of the public security bureau.    The informed source disclosed that Fu Rui, son of CPC elder  Peng Zhen, will replace Li Youwei as city party secretary. Fu  Rui is currently Standing Committee member of the Guangdong CPC  Committee and head of the committee's organization department.  It is very likely that the office of mayor will be taken  temporarily by Wang Zhongfu, the vice mayor. Li Decheng,  general manager of the Shenzhen State-Owned Assets Management  Company, and Wang Ju, party secretary of Longgang District, will  replace Li Guangzhen and Li Zhuanfang respectively as vice  mayors. It has been decided that the new chief of the city  public security bureau will be He Jinghuan, former director of  the political department of the provincial public security  bureau. The new head of the propaganda department is Shao  Hanqing (female), who has already taken office.    The informed source said that the big personnel reshuffle at  the leading level in Shenzhen this time is a rarely seen  large-scale personnel adjustment since the founding of the  special economic zone. The direct cause is that in the past two  years, Shenzhen experienced a series of fires and explosions,  exemplified by the big explosion at the dangerous goods  warehouse at Clear Water River on 5 August 1993 and the big fire  in the town of Kui Yong on 19 November the same year.    According to information, the investigation report on the  big  explosion at Clear Water River, [Qingshui He] prepared by the  central investigation team, pointed out that Shenzhen City CPC  Committee, Shenzhen City government, and Shenzhen City public  security bureau all had responsibility for the incident. Since  then, news on a reshuffle of the leading levels of Shenzhen have  kept coming. The informed source said that the reshuffle this  time is precisely an embodiment of the spirit of "taking  responsibility," even though several personnel are retiring due  to age, such as Li Guangzhen and Yang Guanghui.    Li Decheng, who is considered to be one of the candidates  for  vice mayor, was transferred from the north several years ago.  The Shenzhen State-Owned Assets Management Company, of which he  is the general manager, is in fact the chief housekeeper of  state-run enterprises in the whole city, and has a very  important position. He has recently been promoted to the  position of member of the Standing Committee of Shenzhen City  CPC Committee. It is generally held that he will replace Vice  Mayor Li Guangzhen, to oversee the departments of commerce,  foreign trade, and ports. Wang Ju, who is currently the party  secretary of Longgang District, was a cadre in Shenzhen when  Liang Xiang was the boss, and is considered an "elder having  served three bosses," and he has continuously worked in the  departments overseeing capital construction. He is also a  Standing Committee member of the city party committee, and it is  believed that he will take over from Vice Mayor Li Zhuanfang,  who has overseen urban construction. Shao Hanqing, who is the  new head of the propaganda department of the city party  committee, has served as assistant to the mayor, and it is  generally believed that she will be promoted to the Standing  Committee of Shenzhen City CPC Committee upon the official  retirement of Yang Guanghui to become the "strong woman" at the  most senior level in the city. He Jinghuan, who has taken over  from Liang Dajun, has already moved into his office, and his  official position is party secretary of the city's public  security bureau; it is expected that he will be promoted to the  Standing Committee soon, and will be assigned to the post of the  head of the public security bureau by the people's congress next  year.    Among the outgoing officials, Li Guangzhen, Yang Guanghui,  and Liang Dajun will retire, and they will probably go to the  city people's congress or the city committee of the Chinese  People's Political Consultative Conference, to take some  symbolic posts. Li Zhuanfang has yet to reach the age of  retirement, and it has been alleged that she will come to Hong  Kong to take charge of the Shenye Group Company. It is still  undecided where Li Youwei will go after he leaves the posts of  city party secretary and mayor. It has been alleged that he  will go overseas. He left Shenzhen at the end of last month,  and the official explanation is that he is in Beijing to  "undergo surgery."</p>

			<p><P> August 17, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Israeli officials are depriving the 700,000 Palestinians in the occupied Gaza  Strip of adequate medical care as an additional means of battling the Arab  uprising, a group of doctors charged. Members of the group -- the Assn. of  Israeli and Palestinian Physicians for Human Rights -- said at a news  conference that indifference by Israeli authorities and political obstacles  also have led to poor medical care in the territories. The group cited a severe  shortage of doctors -- one per 1,400 residents in Gaza, compared to one per 400  residents in Israel. The military government's chief medical officer in Gaza  denied the charges.  </P></p>

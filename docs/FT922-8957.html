			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / Survey of Business Air Travel (11): Bush pledge on fiscal relief is welcomed by jet industry - Corporate and executive aircraft IT IS, perhaps, self-evident that a corporate jet market does not flourish in recessionary times. Throw in a few complicating factors - such as tax disincentives or a forbidding product liability climate in the US - and life for general aviation manufacturers becomes tough, indeed. That is roughly what has occurred over the past few years. According to the Washington-based General Aviation Manufacturers' Association - which represents 32 US manufacturers of general aviation aircraft, engines and related equipment - the industry shipped a total of 1,021 aircraft in 1991. That was the lowest annual number since World War Two, and it took new aircraft revenues below the Dollars 2bn mark - to Dollars 1.97bn. Within this depressing overall picture, the turbojet segment was actually the most heartening. A total of 186 turbojet aircraft was shipped last year  -a 10.7 per cent increase on 1990's 168 - while the number of turboprops fell by 21 per cent and piston-powered aircraft were down by 11.8 per cent. But all things are relative; in the peak year, 1981, 389 jets were delivered by US manufacturers. There is a clear reason for this fall-off in deliveries. Jets often represent discretionary expenditure. When corporate belts are being tightened, such outlays - which, in the case of a corporate jet can range between Dollars 2.5m and Dollars 25m - are among the first to be pruned. Questions of image may also be involved. In the words of one analyst recently: 'When you're laying off hundreds of workers, buying a corporate jet does not look good.' In the US, the luxury tax on the sales of new general aviation aircraft, which was imposed by Congress in 1990, has also been blamed for putting an additional dampener on demand. The tax has been levied on that portion of a new aircraft's price that exceeds Dollars 250,000, but is waived if the aircraft is flown 80 per cent or more for business purposes. General aviation manufacturers have complained of lost sales as a direct result - for jets, turboprops and piston-powered aircraft. For example, Beech, owned by Raytheon, has been quoted as saying that the tax had stymied over 50 aircraft sales by the end of 1991. It was, therefore, with some relief that the industry heard President Bush's 'State of the Union' address earlier this year, in which he promised some fiscal relief. Just for good measure, there was also a call for tort reform which has devastated light aircraft production. The GAMA termed it 'a positive step in the right direction, although it still demanded that a more powerful 'growth package' be enacted. Given these problems, it is perhaps surprising that jet business has held up as well as it has. Most manufacturers gratefully acknowledge that demand from 'foreign' countries - such as the Middle East, Latin America and selective European nations - has been the mainstay. Cessna, for example, which has now pulled out of the piston aircraft market and relies entirely on the jet and turboprop markets - reckons that non-US sales for its Citation jets are currently running at over 50 per cent of the total. This compares with around 14 per cent in 1984. Another US jet manufacturer lists Mexico and Venezuela as leading markets in Latin America, while Italy and Germany are still reckoned to be strong European customers. Dassault Aviation, the French manufacturer, has also stated that foreign sales are critical to growth and market share. Certainly, there has been a fair amount of activity in terms of new products and design work. The smaller, lower-priced jet market is one example. Here, some forecasts have suggested that up to 2,000 jets could be sold over the next 15 years, as the 'small' jets compete on price with turboprops, and attempt to eat into the latter market. Cessna's six-seat Citation jet, which started out with a Dollars 2.5m price tag but which has crept up since, is scheduled to be delivered late this year. Industry observers expect a fierce marketing battle with its Wichita neighbour, Beech Aircraft, which - besides making the larger and more expensive Beechjet - produces turboprops in the Citation jet price range. 'The continued development of new business jets bodes well for the future,' noted Mr Edward Stimpson, GAMA's president, recently. 'US manufacturers have continued to invest heavily in R&amp;D in the midst of a prolonged recession. Several new jets have been announced and others are nearing certification.' The industry has, of course, seen a sprinkling of ownership changes. Cessna was sold to Textron, the aerospace and financial services conglomerate, for Dollars 600m earlier this year. Raytheon and Dassault are believed to have been among the handful of final bidders. And now British Aerospace, the UK group, plans to divest its corporate jet subsidiary.</p>

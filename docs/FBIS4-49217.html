			<p>BFN     [Text] Shanghai, May 4 (XINHUA) -- Shanghai, China's  leading commercial center, has designated six service industries  as top-priority development industries to serve the whole of  China, according to a municipal government official.    These industries are finance and insurance, commerce and  trade, telecommunications and transportation, real estate,  tourism and information, the official said.    He said the first three industries have become a "driving  force" behind Shanghai's fast-growing service sector. The three  industries furnished 73 percent of the sector's added value of  57.2 billion yuan in 1993.    The service sector accounted for about 38 percent of the  city's gross domestic product -- the value of goods and services  produced -- in 1993, the official said.    The sector's ratio in Shanghai's economy is expected to grow  to 40 percent this year, he added.    He described the growth of the finance and insurance  industry  in recent years as "remarkable."    The number of financial institutions in Shanghai soared to  319 at the end of 1993 from 90 at the end of 1991, he said.    In addition, the added value of the financial and insurance  industry shot up to 14.1 billion yuan in 1993 from roughly eight  billion yuan in 1991.    The industry now accounts for nearly one-tenth of Shanghai's  economy, he said.    The mushrooming of national markets has become the most  vigorous driving force behind Shanghai's commercial and trade  industry, he said.    For example, the turnover of the Shanghai Metals Exchange,  the Shanghai Grain and Edible Oil Exchange, the Shanghai  Petroleum Exchange and the Shanghai Stock Exchange marked 380  billion yuan, 25 billion yuan, 54 billion yuan and 520 billion  yuan, respectively.    The telecommunications and computer industries have been  growing rapidly in recent years with the faster creation of a  market economy in Shanghai, the official said.    For instance, the output value of the telecommunications  industry doubled to 6.8 billion yuan in 1993.    Firms providing special services have been springing up over  the past few years, he said.    The city now has some 1,000 information, consultancy and  intermediate economic agencies. More than 5,000 people now work  in hundreds of law and accountancy offices.    Moreover, Shanghai now has an agency which files customs  declarations for clients; international service companies which  provide all kinds of services to foreign investors; management  companies which supply managerial personnel to customers; a  vaults company which stores valuable goods for Chinese and  overseas clients; and investment consultancy companies which  provide information and data or make feasibility studies for  investors from other parts of China and overseas.</p>

			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / Few significant differences in prices found: MMC reports on the car industry broadly back UK dealers but find that smaller vehicles are much cheaper in France and Germany AN ANALYSIS of car price differences across Europe was a core task for the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Surveys in recent years by the Consumers Association and the Federation of European Consumer Associations have claimed that UK prices are substantially higher than those for comparable cars in some other EC countries. The commission concludes, however, that 'a comparison of the price ranges in the UK with those in France and Germany, the two markets studied most similar to the UK in size and both with substantial indigenous manufacturing capacity, does not indicate a significant difference in general price levels.' That does not apply so closely to prices for smaller cars, however. The commission says there are several model variants in France and Germany 'whose adjusted prices appear on any of our assumptions to be considerably lower than those in the UK'. The commission points out that prices in Belgium and in the Netherlands tend to be below those in the other markets in all segments, with particularly noticeable differences in the segment for small cars. 'These smaller markets, however, are affected by a number of factors, including the Belgian price control system and the absence in both countries of a major indigenous manufacturer. Prices in markets of this nature are necessarily less reliable guides to the potential level of prices in the UK.' The commission says the results of its work do not lead it to expect significant differences in prices between the UK and France or Germany in the future. 'We think it reasonable to assume, however, that for individual models, particularly in the smaller car segment, prices to private customers in the UK will be higher than those available in other EC countries, and especially in Belgium and the Netherlands, and that from time to time even the general level of prices may be expected to diverge.' The commission says that list-price differences between the UK and other EC markets are indeed wide, but they narrow considerably when they are adjusted for different levels of equipment specification. In addition, 'some estimation of actual transaction prices is essential,' says the report. The commission relied on information from the carmakers for its evidence for discount levels and other financial benefits offered to buyers and therefore for actual transaction prices. It also accepted that exchange-rate fluctuations have an 'major impact on price differences at any point in time' and accordingly made further significant price adjustments. An appendix to the report indicates the fierce lobbying carried out by the carmakers, in particular in response to the controversial early comparative price research carried out for the commission by Ludvigsen Associates (LAL). 'We received criticisms of various aspects of the LAL report,' says the commission. 'We also received serious complaints from two of the major suppliers, Vauxhall and Ford. Vauxhall, following the recent publication by a company associated with LAL of a report on the motor industry, suggested that LAL had made use of the work it had carried out for us and information supplied in confidence by Vauxhall, in a publication made with a view to commercial gain. It was suggested that a breach of the prohibition in section 133 (1) of the act on the disclosure of information might have occurred.' Ford argued that LAL's apparent commercial interest in a marketing venture whose success was not consistent with selective distribution in its present form was incompatible with its role as the commission's consultant. Vauxhall raised other objections, and the commission says: 'We were therefore requested to expunge from our report all reference to the LAL work and to base no conclusions on this work.' LAL rejected the allegations of bias, however, and the commission backed it up. New Motor Cars. HMSO. Pounds 46; Motor Car Parts. HMSO.

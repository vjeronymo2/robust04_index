			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / Business Travel: Revival of a ghost town - The reconstruction of Beirut is under way After years in the wilderness, Lebanon is starting to put itself back on the map, and it would like the world to notice. This will not be easy. From 1975 to 1990 Lebanon was racked by a civil war involving an array of religious sects and interested neighbours; 200,000 or so people died and 1m fled abroad. And foreigners were targeted: Terry Waite was the best known of many hostages. The war was not won. It just wound down. But the shooting stopped and the hostages went free. A comprehensive Middle East settlement remains in the future, but Beirut is a city at peace, with much reconstruction to be done. A Dollars 1.8bn company called Solidere was floated this year to rebuild downtown Beirut. It has raised some 95 per cent of its capital from Lebanese at home and abroad, though foreign groups have taken a big share of the contracts. Americans, however, are restrained by a state department ban on Beirut airport. In the meantime, the core of Beirut is an eerie place. Several blocks near the Place des Martyrs and the Green Line, which divided east and west Beirut, have been cordoned off from traffic. Squatters have been thrown out. The streets are lined with elegant stone buildings. Though windows and shop-fronts have been blasted away and walls pockmarked by sniper fire, the fabric is sound, for the area was spared the heavy shelling that devastated other parts of town. Solidere has pulled down 300 of the most damaged buildings - far too many, say critics of its mega-plans to provide marinas, reconstruct vanished souks and create a residential 'Levantine village'. Next comes a three-year rebuild-ing of the infrastructure. After that, the remaining buildings will be restored and the inner city brought back to life. Until then, the authorities hope the area will prove a tourist attraction - morbid perhaps, but an authentic modern ghost town. Beyond the downtown area, Beirut is alive and bustling, though there are armed groups of soldiers and military police everywhere, some in tanks. It is by no means clear what they are for, and foreigners may feel that their presence makes the city look more of a militarised zone than it really is. Out in the countryside we heard a rattle of gunfire. 'Shooting birds,' said our guide firmly. 'Wedding celebrations,' said someone else's guide, equally firmly. Whatever it was, it wasn't war. Many of the soldiers are Syrian peacekeepers, and there are more images of Syria's President Hafez al-Assad than of Lebanon's own leaders. At ground level, Beirut - once known for its Riviera-like beauty - is dusty. From the mountains, it looks appallingly polluted, swathed in a dense brown cloud. The main reason is cars: one 'statistic' we were given was that there were five for every household. Real postwar Lebanese statistics are almost non-existent, but public transport was one of the institutions wiped out. Everyone drives (hair-raisingly badly) and jams are common. Taxis are cheap, however, and drivers, like everyone else, are happy to charge in US dollars. Solidere's plans call for the construction of big hotels in town and the restoration of old ones such as the St George's, now a seafront ruin. Meanwhile, there are a dozen or so comfortable upmarket places that offer reasonably prompt telecommunication services. The best are said to be the Coral Beach and Summerland on the water-front, starting at around Dollars 160 a night. Most international cuisines are represented in Beirut, though the most enjoyable is Lebanon's own, based on mezze - 20 or more small dishes of different dips, snacks and starters. After dark, some establishments lure customers with 'top Bulgarian strip-girls', but those of us who tried clubs found only so-so discos and belly-dancers. Beirutis themselves seem to spend the evenings ambling along the corniche, chatting and drinking coffee. Dress codes are unrestrictive (men should wear ties for business meetings, which are apt to start slightly late), and the currency is all in paper, with about LPounds 1,660 to the dollar. Bargaining is widespread. If you have a spare day, try a trip to Baalbek, 50 miles inland in the lush Bekaa valley, which has magnificent Roman ruins. Those with more time may like to visit the ruins in the 9,000-year-old city of Byblos, the 19th-century palace of Beit Eddine, or the forest of Lebanese cedars at Bsherri near Tripoli. A new airline, British Mediterranean Airways, has started direct flights from London to Beirut five days a week (not Wednesday or Sunday), with return fares from Pounds 399. It joins the thrice-weekly service of Middle East Airlines. Be warned: formalities at Beirut airport can be time-consuming. See Observer</p>

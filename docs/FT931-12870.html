			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / People: Clarke moves to another Australian team David Clarke, a former head of the London office of Australian brokers Potter Warburg, has joined the London arm of County NatWest Securities Australia, where he will help develop its corporate broking business. Clarke, one of the best known figures in London's Australian broking community, is the latest in a string of Potter executives who have defected to County NatWest Securities Australia, one of the few jewels in the overseas operations of National Westminster Bank's often troubled investment banking operations. County NatWest Securities Australia was formed six years ago around a nucleus of young ex-Potter executives who had quit following S G Warburg's decision to take a 50 per cent stake in Potter. Led by Rob Thomas and Kevin Crotty, and recently joined by Greg Burns, a top equity salesman, County NatWest Securities Australia has overtaken the renamed Potter Warburg, and now has the biggest share of institutional broking business in the competitive Australian market. The arrival of Clarke, who had been with Potter for 24 years, is fresh evidence of County NatWest's plans to exploit its strength in Australia's secondary market by expanding its corporate broking side. Clarke's new job will be much the same as it was at Potter Warburg. He will set up a corporate and investor relations unit in London. ***** Ewan Millar is appointed medical director of SCOTIA PHARMACEUTICALS; he moves from Abbott Laboratories. ***** David Williams, formerly md of Courage Managed Houses, has been appointed md of Malden Timber, part of WICKES. ***** Ron Campbell, formerly md of Thorn EMI Rental-UK, has been appointed deputy chief executive of THORN EMI Rental Group; Doug Anderson, previously president of Rent-a-Center in the US, has been promoted to chief executive of Thorn EMI Rental-UK.</p>

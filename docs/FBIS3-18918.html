France first and foremost, speaking through  Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, had urged in favour of increasing  the number of blue helmets in Bosnia. The French view is that  reinforcements should be provided by the Twelve but also by the  United States. Speaking to the press, Mr. Papoulias, however,  refused to say whether any of the other EC countries have so far  stated their willingness to actively participate in this further  effort considered necessary. Mr. Juppe, for his part, pointed  out that France (which already has the largest contingent of  blue helmets) had "done its duty." The French Minister,  moreover, launched an appeal to his European partners to  reintegrate the Serbs into the peace process. "Peace will not  be achieved with two parties when there are three in the  conflict," he said speaking of the recent agreement reached  between Croats and Muslims on the creation of a two-sided  federation in Bosnia. The Twelve also stressed the growing  importance of the role henceforth played by the United States  and Russia in bringing peace to Bosnia while recalling that the  European Union could not see itself reduced to an "inferior  role" as Mr. Papoulias had stated, before going on to say that  the EC is "interested" in strengthened diplomatic activity by  the United States and Russia in the peace process, "but it still  wishes to keep to its peace plan."</p>

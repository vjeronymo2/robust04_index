			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / International Company News: Investor lifted by Saab-Scania Investor, the most important holding company of Sweden's powerful Wallenberg empire, increased pre-tax profits more than three times in the first half, after a strong rebound at Saab-Scania, its wholly owned vehicle and aerospace unit. The group's pre-tax income amounted to SKr1.19bn (Dollars 156m) for the period, compared with SKr367m a year earlier. It said second-half income would be higher than in the first. The shares rose SKr5 to SKr176. A much improved performance at Saab-Scania - which last week reported a pre-tax profit, after financial items, of SKr1.2bn, against a SKr264m loss in 1993 - was the main reason for the upturn. Saab-Scania's earnings are also expected to be stronger in the second half. The group's investment performance - it has strategic shareholdings in a clutch of Swedish blue-chips, including Astra, Ericsson, Electrolux, Stora and SKF - was more disappointing as it failed to be keep pace with the stock exchange. The value of the group's investment portfolio at June 30 was SKr27.5bn, down 7 per cent since the start of the year, compared with a 2 per cent drop for the Affarsvarlden General Index. The group's net worth at the same date was SKr38.3bn, or SKr192 a share, compared with SKr37.5bn, or SKr206 at the year-end. Both the value of the portfolio and net worth have risen since June 30. Net debt rose to SKr6.88bn from SKr4.85bn, partly because of higher tied-up working capital within Saab-Scania.</p>

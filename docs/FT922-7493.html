			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / Income bond sales reach 2-year high SALES of national savings income bonds reached their highest levels for nearly two years in April. The amount invested in income bonds rose to Pounds 160m, contributing to total gross sales of Pounds 834m. Sales of fixed-interest certificates were Pounds 256m. After repayments, including accumulated interest, of Pounds 501m, net receipts amounted to Pounds 333m. Repayments were lower than March's by almost Pounds 100m, mainly because there were no fixed-interest certificate issues maturing during April. Accrued interest was Pounds 172m, making a total contribution to government funding in April of Pounds 505m.</p>

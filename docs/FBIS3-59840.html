			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by 'Uthman Mirghani] </F>   [Text] The current crisis in Yemen seems to be more graver  than preceding ones, particularly since some parties have begun  talking daily with voices growing louder about endangered unity  and the possibility of divisiveness returning. Reading the  statements of President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and his deputy  Salim al-Bid one would feel the widening alienation between  them, and would sense the depth of the political crisis and the  danger threatening Yemeni unity.    In a press interview with him before the election of the new  presidential council, President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih said that a  collective style of leadership is a communist party tradition  that has proved its failure. He believes that al-Bid's going  into seclusion will probably continue "perhaps because some  think that results can be achieved by going into seclusion. But  his deputy 'Ali al-Bid believes that the General People's  Congress Party [GPC] is dominating the unitary state. He asserts  that he will not go to Sanaa unless it really becomes the  capital of the Yemeni Republic (the unitary state), and not of  the Yemeni Arab Republic (formerly northern Yemen).    Because the differences between the president and the vice  president and between the GPC and its ally the YSP [Yemeni  Socialist Party] are really deep, the election of a new  presidential council and the confirmation of 'Ali al-Bid in his  position as vice president, although he was not sworn in with  the rest of the council members, does not mean that the crisis  is over and the dangers to unity have receded. Rather, what  happened was maintaining the status quo and keeping the crisis  in suspension, with all what this may entail in terms of  paralyzing the government and impeding merging the institutions  and consolidating national unity.    It is no secret that failure to complete the merger of the  armed forces underscores the danger the political dispute  between the GPC and the YSP poses to unity. Al-Bid recently  confirmed what certain reports said about armed forces put on  alert during the recent elections, which has almost set off a  serious problem between the former two Yemenis. Many quarters  believe that the YSP does not want to lose the army card before  its demands are realized and its differences with its northern  allies are solved.    Maintaining the status quo involves great dangers,  particularly since the building of unity needs a consensus of  views and building bridges of trust in order to overcome the  many difficulties and obstacles which we have seen plague even a  developed and rich country like Germany. Circumstances have  decreed that difficulties of unity in Yemen be coupled with  difficulties of democracy, thereby heightening pressures on the  nascent unitary state. Overcoming such difficulties cannot be  realized by the expression of wishes, but rather by hard work  and unlimited patience because the alternative would be not only  the collapse of unity but also the possibilities of a bloody  civil war in which the biggest loser will be Yemen and the  Yemenis.</p>

			<p>CSO     [Excerpt] Guayaquil--Between 1992 and 1993 the number of  cases of malaria in Ecuador increased by 6,198, according to  official data made available to HOY by the National Service for  the Eradication of Malaria [SNEM].    According to the data, there were 46,711 cases of malaria  throughout Ecuador at the end of 1993. This total is higher than  that for 1992, when 40,513 cases were identified. This proves  that this illness has not declined in Ecuador but, on the  contrary, has increased dangerously, despite the continuing  spraying campaigns carried out by the SNEM.    A joint meeting was held between officials of the  Subsecretariat of Health of the Coastal Area and those of the  SNEM and of the provincial directorates which come under the  SNEM.    According to official figures, of the 46,711 cases of  malaria  reported in 1993 some 15,233 were of the "falciparum" variety  (cerebral malaria which can cause death) and 31,478 cases of the  "vivax" variety (the usual type of malaria).  <H5>  Province of Guayas </H5>   Regarding the areas most affected in the Province of Guayas,  in 1992 there were 1,677 cases of "falciparum" malaria and 2,710  cases of "vivax" malaria. On the other hand, in 1991 there were  3,903 cases of "falciparum" malaria and 4,701 cases of "vivax"  malaria. In 1993 there were 3,903 cases of "falciparum" malaria  and 4,701 cases of "vivax" malaria.  <H5>  Province of Manabi </H5>   In the Province of Manabi 6,583 cases of "falciparum"  malaria  and 3,054 cases of "vivax" malaria were confirmed in 1992. In  1993 there was a total of 7,284 cases of "falciparum" malaria  and 2,897 cases of "vivax" malaria.  <H5>  Province of Esmeraldas </H5>   In the Province of Esmeraldas there were 3,768 cases of  "falciparum" malaria and 7,069 cases of "vivax" malaria in 1992,  while there were 5,665 cases of "falciparum" malaria and 6,772  cases of "vivax" malaria in 1993.

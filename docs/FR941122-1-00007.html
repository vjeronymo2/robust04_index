			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under current rules at 7 CFR 277.18(c), the State agency is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to obtain prior written approval from FNS when it plans  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to acquire ADP equipment or services with enhanced Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> funding, regardless of the cost, or at the regular funding rate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> if total acquisition costs meet or exceed $500,000 in Federal and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State funds. By dropping enhanced funding, the dollar threshold  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> before FNS approval is required for all ADP systems would be the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard $500,000 threshold applicable to the regular funding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements at &sect;277.18(c). As a result of this change,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modifications or revisions to systems and services previously  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approved at the enhanced funding rate described at &sect;273.18(c) but  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which the total cost of the system does not meet or exceed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $500,000 would no longer be subject to prior FNS approval  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> beginning April 1, 1994, as long as the total cost of the system  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remains under $500,000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, the Department will retain most of the requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of &sect;277.18, but is proposing modifications to that section. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed modifications include the elimination of requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that pertain solely to enhanced funding and retention of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> baseline requirements and dollar thresholds for FNS funding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> systems under the standard funding at &sect;277.18(b), (c)(1)&hyph;(c)(2),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d)(1)&hyph;(d)(2), (e)(1) and (p)(5). In addition, the Department  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposes to retain certain conditions set forth in &sect;277.18(g)(1)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and (g)(2) that are currently tied to receipt of enhanced funding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> since the Leland Act amendments made these conditions applicable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to receipt of funding at the standard funding rate. Therefore,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Department is proposing that as a condition of receiving  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approval for funding at the 50 percent standard funding rate, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed ADP system must: (1) Assist the State agency in meeting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the requirements of the Food Stamp Act; (2) meet the Model Plan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements specified in &sect;272.10 of this part; (3) provide for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more efficient and effective administration of the program; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) be compatible with other such systems used in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administration of State agency plans under the Aid to Families  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with Dependent Children (AFDC) program. Accordingly, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department proposes to amend &sect;277.18(g)(1) and (g)(2) to set out  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these conditions and to revise the heading of the section to read  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Conditions for Receiving FFP.'' The Department is further  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposing to extend the requirements at &sect;277.18(g)(3) to all ADP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> systems. That section currently requires that the proposed ADP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> systems receiving enhanced funding be Statewide and integrated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with AFDC, unless the State agency can demonstrate that a local,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dedicated or single function system will provide for more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efficient and effective administration of the program. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department is proposing to modify this requirement so it applies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to all ADP systems regardless of funding level.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department is also proposing to make conforming amendments to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;274.12(k) to reflect the elimination of enhanced funding for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> development of electronic benefit transfer (EBT) systems which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are components of complete ADP systems to be developed in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accordance with &sect;277.18(g).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> SAVE_Section 277.19  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On October 7, 1988 at 53 FR 39433, the Department published a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule which authorized 100 percent Federal funding for State and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> local agency costs incurred in the verification of the documented  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alien status of Food Stamp Program applicants through the SAVE  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program. The requirements to receive the enhanced funding are at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;277.19.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 13961 of Leland Act amends Section 16 of the Act (7  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> U.S.C. 2025) to reduce Federal funding for SAVE activity from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 100 percent reimbursement rate to the regular 50 percent rate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The change in rates is effective, by law, on April 1, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The new rate applies to State and local agency costs incurred in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the verification of the documented alien status of Food Stamp  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Program applicants through the SAVE program. The current rule at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;272.11(e) requires State agencies to submit a SAVE plan as an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attachment to the State agency's Plan of Operation prior to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receiving funding. The current rule at &sect;277.19 sets forth the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required conditions for obtaining 100 percent FFP for SAVE. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department is proposing to retain the current requirement for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SAVE plan at &sect;272.11 but is proposing to delete &sect;277.19.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

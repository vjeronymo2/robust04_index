			<p><P> November 9, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> HAWTHORNE LOSES PARK BID -- BUT HOLDS AN ACE  </P> <P> Foreign investors have outbid the city of Hawthorne for 5.8 acres of Caltrans  property alongside the San Diego (405) Freeway, despite the city's insistence  that it will not rezone the land, which is designated for park use.  </P> <P> City Manager Kenneth Jue said investors from Asia, South America and Europe  have offered to pay nearly $1.5 million for the 21 parcels along Glasgow Place  in Hawthorne.  </P> <P> For years, the city has sought to buy the narrow, mile-long strip on the west  side of the freeway between Wiseburn and Rosecrans avenues for use as parkland.  In September, Assemblyman Richard E. Floyd (D-Hawthorne) persuaded legislators  to provide the city with $200,000 to buy the Glasgow strip.  </P> <P> However, Jue said, the city offer of $200,000 for 20 parcels totaling 202,482  square feet fell far short Tuesday of winning the bidding contest.  </P> <P> "I'm disappointed but not surprised," he said.  </P> <P> Jue said a city representative attending the real estate sale tried to inform  the investors of the city's intentions for the land. But he said the investors  either could not understand the city representative because they did not speak  English or because they were unfamiliar with the zoning laws.  </P> <P> Selma Gleason, a spokeswoman for Caltrans, said eight investors offered a total  of $1,473,864 for the parcels. She said each bidder spoke English and was  notified in the bidding manual of the current zoning.  </P> <P> Gleason declined to disclose the names or nationalities of the investors.  </P> <P> According to Gleason, the bidders were required to place a deposit of $5,000.  The deposit automatically gives a successful bidder one year to obtain  rezoning, variances and clearances from the city. If the zoning or code changes  cannot be obtained, the buyer can void the purchase agreement but must also  forfeit the $5,000 deposit to Caltrans.  </P> <P> Two six-month extensions can be bought for $10,000 each.  </P> <P> On several occasions, the City Council has maintained that the land, near the  Holly Glen neighborhood, is not suitable for development, partly because of its  closeness to the freeway. Single-family homes that once occupied the strip were  demolished when Caltrans acquired the land.  </P> <P> Jue said he believes that the investors will forfeit the property once they  realize the city will not rezone.  </P></p>

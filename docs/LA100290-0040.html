			<p><P> October 2, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SOCKERS' TOP PICK ARRIVES -- FOR A VISIT  </P> <P> Marcelo Balboa -- the Sockers' first pick in the Major Soccer League draft and  the player team officials hope will reinforced an undermanned defense --  arrived in town Monday.  </P> <P> But only for a stopover. Balboa, a U.S. national team member, leaves on Friday  for Europe, where the U.S. squad will tour for two weeks.  </P> <P> Balboa said that while he is in town, he and his agent, father Luis Balboa,  will talk with the Sockers about a contract. But Balboa made it clear he will  sign with the Sockers only if the U.S. Soccer Federation does not extend his  national team contract, which expires Jan. 1.  </P> <P> "Right now, everything is up in the air," Balboa said. "It all depends on what  the national team does -- if they give us contracts, or not. If it folds, I'll  definitely play indoor."  </P> <P> Balboa said USSF officials told players they would be notified of the team's  future while in Europe, but Eric Wynalda, who, like Balboa, played collegiately  at San Diego State, said that the USSF plans to continue the national team.  </P> <P> Wynalda was drafted by the Dallas Sidekicks. He said he received a message from  the team last week, but did not return the call because he plans on staying  with the national team.  </P> <P> "For the most part," Wynalda said, "it has been indicated to us that the  program will go on and that will probably be confirmed on the trip."  </P> <P> Balboa said he has not heard that.  </P> <P> "But maybe Eric has heard something I haven't," Balboa said. "There's been so  many rumors flying around. I hope he's right."  </P> <P> A sign that Wynalda may be right came Monday when USSF President Alan  Rothenberg announced that embattled Coach Bob Gansler will be given a contract  for 1991.  </P> <P> If the U.S. team does continue and a contract is extended to Balboa, the  Sockers would be in dire need of a solid defender. During the summer they lost  All-Star George Fernandez and steady Ralph Black through free agency. Two other  defensive cogs from last year, Cacho and Arturo Velazco, also are gone. Cacho  has not been offered a contract, though he has been invited to training camp,  and Velazco plans to play elsewhere.  </P> <P> "I think Marcelo Balboa is a quality player," said Brian Quinn, a Socker  player/coach. "And I think he would have adapted quickly. (If he doesn't show)  it obviously leaves a big void to be filled by us. We were counting on him."  </P> <P> The Sockers may have one patch already in place. Quinn said the team will  likely sign Alex Golovnia, a Soviet player who played outdoor with Socker  forward Rod Castro during the summer for the Orlando Lions of the American  Soccer League. Golovnia has not played indoor for any length of time, yet Quinn  said he has looked promising in training.  </P> <P> "But I think we still need another good defender," Quinn said.  </P> <P> Even if the USSF decides not to extend Balboa's contract and he eventually  makes his way to the Sockers, he will miss all of training camp -- crucial for  a player who has never played indoor -- and at least the season's first two  games, Oct. 19 and 20.  </P></p>

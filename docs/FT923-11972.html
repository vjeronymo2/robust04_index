			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / Arts: Today's Television Bitter Harvest, tonight's Screenplay (BBC2 at 9.00pm) is a tale of murder, exploitation, and British West Indians in search of their 'roots', filmed in the sugar cane fields of Dominica. This week's Fighting Back could be riveting. TV producer Desmond Wilcox describes his heart-bypass and peers at someone else on the slab undergoing the same op. (Do the people cut up nightly on screen for our delectation receive appearance fees?) The World in a Garden (C4 at 8.30pm) begins a four-part series describing the restoration of a Victorian garden at Biddulph Grange, Staffordshire. E. Nesbit's Edwardian classic, Five Children and It is being repeated (BBC 1 at 5.05pm). In case you were wondering, It is a furry creature, the Psammead. Worth capturing on video, in case the summer hols are rained off. The comedy film Gung Ho (BBC 1 at 10.25pm), made in 1986, centres on the clash between American and Japanese values in the work-place. It stars Michael Keaton (alias Batman) as foreman of a car-plant who acts as cultural go-between.</p>

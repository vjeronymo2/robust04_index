			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / MPs demand more cash for primary education The government should increase funding for primary schools, a cross-party Commons committee recommended yesterday. It said that 'any real-terms increase in funding that becomes available, from either national or local government' should be distributed 'disproportionately in favour of primary schools'. There should also be a small annual shift in funding between the sectors, moving towards a common pupil-teacher ratio for both. The committee said that at present there was 'insufficient support time' for teachers in primary schools, where there are 22.21 pupils to each teacher, compared with 15.83 in secondary schools. An average of 40 per cent more is spent on each English secondary pupil than for each primary pupil. The report said: 'If any particular phase of school education is funded at a disproportionately low level, children of all ages will suffer, and in the long run the nation as a whole suffers.' Unions gave the report a strong welcome, but said that funds for secondary schools should not be cut. The government welcomed the report as a contribution to debate. The government intends to spread the common funding formula for grant-maintained secondary schools to another 16 local authorities next year. It will add to the incentives for schools still with those local authorities to opt out. Under the formula grant-maintained schools are paid the funding they would have received if their local authority had spent as much on education as was predicted by the government's standard spending assessment, even if the authority spends less than that official assessment. But if the council spends more than its assessment the formula allows for opted-out schools to be paid more. The 16 authorities, in all of which 30 per cent of secondary pupils are taught in grant-maintained schools, are: Barnet, Brent, Cambridgeshire, Croydon, Cumbria, Ealing, Enfield, Hertfordshire, Kent, Kingston-upon-Thames, Lambeth, Lincolnshire, Southwark, Sutton, Wandsworth, and Wiltshire.

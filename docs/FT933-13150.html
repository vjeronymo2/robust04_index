			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / GM settles truck lawsuits GENERAL MOTORS has agreed to settle dozens of lawsuits by giving the owners of some 4.7m pick-up trucks with side-mounted petrol tanks Dollars 1,000 (Pounds 666) in coupons towards the purchase of a new GM vehicle, agencies report from Detroit. In two separate agreements filed in a state court in Texas and a federal court in Philadelphia, GM said it settled all the outstanding class action lawsuits filed by owners of its 1973-1987 pick-ups. The owners wanted to be reimbursed for resale value they said they lost because the trucks are allegedly vulnerable to explosions in side-on collisions. In April the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration asked GM to recall the pick-ups, based on a finding that the trucks were 2.4 times more likely to catch fire in fatal side-on collisions than similar trucks built by Ford. GM claims, however, that the pick-ups are safe and reiterated yesterday that it did not intend to recall the trucks. 'It does not affect the NHTSA case in any way, shape or form,' a GM official said. 'This is not a recall. There is absolutely no modification of the vehicle. This separates the customer satisfaction concerns from the technical concerns.' The Dollars 1,000 certificates are transferable within an immediate family and cannot be sold without the truck.</p>

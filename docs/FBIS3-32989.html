			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed ARS: "Group of Cubans at Residence of </F> Belgian Ambassador in Havana"; as released by Brussels BELGA  Database]    [Text] Brussels, 15 Feb (BELGA) -- On Monday evening, the  Foreign Ministry announced that on 26 January last a group of  eight Cubans, comprising five men, two women, and one child aged  two years, forced their way into the residence of the Belgian  ambassador in Havana and immediately sought political asylum.    One of the persons concerned has since left the residence of  his own accord.    While awaiting a solution, the ambassador has given his  permission to the persons involved to remain in the Belgian  residence, which enjoys diplomatic immunity.    In the contacts that were immediately established with the  Cuban authorities, the Belgian Government firmly insisted that  the requests of the persons concerned be met, including their  wish to leave the country.    Despite efforts, it appears the Cuban authorities hold only  a  faint hope of seeing the interested parties being authorized to  leave the country directly from the residence.    The Belgian Government will, in any event, continue to  demand  that a humane solution be found to the situation, including the  provision of the necessary guarantees regarding the fate of  those involved in the future.    In particular, the Belgian Government will not accept these  persons being punished for the simple reason that they forced  their way into the Belgian residence, concluded the press  release issued by the Foreign Ministry.</p>

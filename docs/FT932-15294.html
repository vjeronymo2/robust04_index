			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / UK Company News: Rich rewards from white-collar focus - A look at Capita and its strategy for success in the public sector A TOTAL of 170 finance staff from the London borough of Bromley will soon become employees of Capita Group, which has expanded rapidly by offering management services to the public sector. Capita's market value has grown seven-fold, to Pounds 72m, since flotation in 1989. Pre-tax profits have surged from Pounds 700,000 in that year to Pounds 4.41m in 1992, on sales of Pounds 33.1m. Unlike other private contractors which have moved in on the public sector, Capita focuses on high-value, high-margin activities such as revenue collection and computers, rather than refuse collection or school meals. Mr Paul Pindar, Capita's managing director, said: 'Providing blue-collar services is not our bag.' He believes that methods used by other operators to win public sector contracts - such as cutting the wages and conditions of staff - are not sustainable in the long term. The Bromley employees, who voted 98 per cent in favour of Capita's offer from a choice of three, will transfer on their existing terms and conditions. Under the Pounds 24m contract Capita will, for the next five years, manage most of the borough's exchequer services - including payroll, pensions, business rates, council tax and benefits. Capita estimates that it will save the council Pounds 1m over the life of the contract, which is three times the size of any previous 'outsourcing' of white-collar services in local government. It also said new opportunities would be created for the Bromley staff, who have seen their workload diminished by recent changes, such as the move from community charge to council tax. Although more than 80 per cent of the group's revenues come from work in the public sector, Capita's distinctive contribution has been to apply sophisticated private-sector business techniques to the traditional activities of local authorities and government agencies - particularly the collection of revenue. Mr Pindar said: 'We want to be in areas that fit - quality areas, with significant margins. That's why we went after revenue - if we can put together something which brings in more cash, then everyone wins.' On behalf of the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency, Capita employs up to 80 people using computerised telephone systems to deal with sales and inquiries for personalised number plates. Since starting in October 1990, it has sold more than 200,000 number plates and raised more than Pounds 100m for the Treasury. Telephoning people at their homes during the evening can be an effective way of raising money. The latest technology from the US allows one operator to make 25-30 calls per hour and be provided with the details of the particular account on a screen when each connection is made. When Capita recently was contracted to call 100,000 people whose TV licence payments were overdue, nearly half of the 60,000 successfully contacted went out and bought a licence soon afterwards. It was success rates like that which encouraged local authorities of all different political persuasions to use Capita to help collect poll tax. In spite of offering services which have been championed by the Conservatives, Capita claims it would not have been upset by a Labour victory at the last general election. Mr Pindar said: 'We were unconcerned about the prospect of either a Tory or Labour government - but a hung parliament might have brought decision-making to a halt.' To date, Capita has employed local authority staff when taking over contracts, but Mr Pindar said: 'Once we have major operating centres, we will offer deals to local authorities which do not involve the transfer of staff.' Following a European directive, employees whose jobs are transferred from one employer to another are protected under the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) regulations. Capita takes a cautious view of its obligations under the rules, and has fulfilled all of their conditions for the staff it has acquired. If Capita took on the work but not the employees for a contract, it says the Tupe obligations would have to be honoured - probably by the local or central government department contracting out the work. The Bromley staff will join Capita's existing workforce of 850, which is divided between two divisions - outsourcing and advisory, which provides consultancy and training services. Capita's shares enjoy a premium rating - partly because of its rapid history of growth and partly due to the group's expanding opportunities, as 'outsourcing' spreads from local authorities to the NHS and into the heart of central government. Although analysts remain bullish about the stock, some point out that it is difficult to evaluate Capita's contracts, which are both large and long-term. BZW says: 'Capita's businesses are complex and the nature of some of them is such as not to lend themselves to external analysis. Were something to go awry, there may be little warning. Mr Pindar responds by pointing to the expertise of the seven-strong board, which includes five accountants. The business started in the early eighties when Mr Rod Aldridge, the current chairman, established a computer services company for the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy. In 1989, a management buy-out was supported by 3i, the venture capital group. Mr Pindar said: 'We are never going to go in and bid just on price. We recently walked away from a contract worth Pounds 10m, on which we had put in nine months' work. In five out of six of the large information technology contracts we won, we were not the cheapest bidder.' Mr Richard Childs, a director, believes contracts are awarded on the basis of quality, added value, price and treatment of staff - in that order. He said: 'We manage the treasurer's lifeblood. If we screw up, the treasurer is going to lose his job.'</p>

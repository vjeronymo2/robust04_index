			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Canada's Tories look to new generation for leader CANADA'S governing Conservatives, seeking to reinvigorate themselves before this year's general election, are shedding almost an entire generation of political veterans. Since Prime Minister Brian Mulroney announced on February 24 he was resigning as party leader, a string of senior cabinet ministers have declined to enter the race to succeed him. Several have also said they will retire from politics at the election, expected in September or October. The rash of departures is partly a recognition by the old guard that the Progressive Conservative party needs fresh faces at the top if it is to overcome deep voter hostility. They also reflect the commanding lead built up by Ms Kim Campbell, defence minister. The latest Mulroney veterans to pull out of contention for the leadership are Mrs Barbara McDougall (external affairs), who is quitting politics, and Mr Bernard Valcourt (employment and immigration). Other ministers who have dropped out of the race include Mr Don Mazankowski (deputy prime minister and finance), Mr Michael Wilson (trade and industry), and Mr Benoit Bouchard (health). Mr Joe Clark, prime minister briefly in 1979-80 and who most recently spearheaded efforts to draw up a new constitution, also plans to leave politics. Mr Mulroney's successor will be chosen at a convention in Ottawa on June 13. Senior party officials, including Mr Mulroney, are quietly encouraging members of the Tory caucus to throw their names into the ring, partly to generate public interest and partly to deflect unremitting scrutiny of Ms Campbell. So far, only Mr Patrick Boyer, a respected but little-known backbencher, has formally announced his candidacy. Two youthful cabinet ministers, Mr Perrin Beatty, who holds the communications portfolio, and Mr Jean Charest, the environment minister, are still expected to enter the race.</p>

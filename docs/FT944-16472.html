			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / People: Cawthra quits Miller Group David Cawthra is to step down as ceo of the Miller Group, the Edinburgh-based construction company, after three years in the post, and hand over to Keith Miller, a member of the family which owns it. His departure was by mutual consent, the company says. Cawthra, 51, joined Miller Group from Balfour Beatty where he was ceo for three years having been with the company since 1979. He was appointed by James Miller who stepped down as ceo but remained chairman. At the time Cawthra said he wanted to make Miller bigger 'both in size and in its worth to the shareholders', and saw 'big opportunities' for up and coming companies 'which seem to have been hit less hard by recession than have the large ones'. But Miller was not immune to the economic downturn and in 1993 lost Pounds 11.9m including exceptional items. Yesterday he said it 'had always been my expectation that a time would arise when it would be appropriate for Keith to take over and I fully agree that that time has now been reached'. He has no new job to go to and will work at Miller till the end of the year. The company said both parties felt it was time for Miller to be led once again by a member of the family. Cawthra's departure did not presage any nasty surprises in the current year's results, it said. Keith Miller, 45, has been responsible for the group's mining activities in the UK and US and yesterday learnt that Scotcoal, its joint venture with Ryan Mining, had been unsuccessful in its bid for the assets of British Coal in Scotland. He is also md of Miller Developments which handles all the group's commercial property ventures and investments. Educated at Heriot Watt and Glasgow universities, he has worked with Miller Group since 1976. Keith Miller is the younger son of the late John Miller, one of the three founding shareholders of the Group and a first cousin of James Miller.</p>

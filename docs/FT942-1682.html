			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / Clarke stays tough on public spending Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, will tell cabinet colleagues today that improvements in the public sector deficit do not signal a trend change and give no room for easing the government's tough approach to public spending. When the cabinet gathers to discuss the spending plans for 1995-96 and the two following financial years, the chancellor is expected to underline that the 'control totals' of Pounds 263bn for the coming financial year and Pounds 272.3bn for 1996-97 are ceilings which the government should try to undershoot. The Treasury is taking no comfort from the final 1993-94 public sector borrowing requirement of Pounds 46bn compared with the November Budget target of Pounds 50bn, nor from the drop in the PSBR for the first two months of 1994-95 to Pounds 8.5bn from Pounds 9.4bn in April and May last year. Today's cabinet meeting comes amid growing pressure both inside and outside Whitehall for a tough new line on public expenditure. It is a time-honoured ritual to forecast very tough bargaining at the beginning of every spending round. But officials say the state of the public finances will make for especially difficult negotiations between the spending departments and the Treasury between now and the Budget at the end of November. Pressure from Tory MPs for tax cuts before the next general election will reinforce the need for a new clampdown on spending. In spite of the Conservatives' poor performance in the European elections, Mr Clarke has insisted that taxes can only be cut if a firm lid is kept on expenditure. Today's meeting will review policies and prospects. It will confirm the membership of the powerful EDX cabinet committee, which is chaired by the chancellor and has the final say about how to share out spending totals among departments. More detailed analysis of departmental spending programmes will come later this year. But the Treasury's fundamental expenditure reviews of Whitehall departments have already thrown up areas which will be closely examined. The Department of Social Security, whose Pounds 85bn of annual expenditure makes it the biggest-spending ministry in Whitehall, may come under pressure to reduce its housing benefit budget. Other areas being examined include legal aid, the costs of running the courts and the merging of work done by the Inland Revenue and Customs &amp; Excise. One minister suggested yesterday that there would also be a tough clampdown on departmental running costs and, in particular, public-sector pay next year. On the public finances, Treasury officials have said that the 1993-94 budget deficit was smaller than expected for special reasons. Measures announced in late 1992, for example, encouraged local authorities to boost receipts from council house sales in the period to the end of 1993 and encouraged a large Pounds 2.9bn debt repayment by them in 1993-94. The Treasury believes it is too soon to draw any positive conclusions from the fall in the PSBR so far this year or predict an undershoot of the 1994-95 target of Pounds 37.9bn. Government officials say it is 'striking' that faster-than-expected economic growth has so far failed to increase revenues or lower government spending, while lower-than-expected inflation is depressing government receipts.

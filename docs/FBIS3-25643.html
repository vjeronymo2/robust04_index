The NEWS AGENCY OF NIGERIA (NAN) reported from  Harare on Wednesday [23 February] that the delegation arrived in  Harare quietly on Sunday aboard a Cameroon Airline aircraft for  discussions with the Zimbabwean Government over the issue.    Diplomatic sources in the region told NAN that the  Cameroonians opted for the diplomatic move to paint Nigeria as  an aggressor in the current conflict and to win sympathy among  the English speaking countries in case the issue was referred to  the OAU for resolution.    Meanwhile, some Nigerians in Zimbabwe have called on the  Federal Government to give the Cameroonians a bloody nose while  others called for restraint. A Nigerian lecturer at the  University of Zimbabwe, Dr. Hameed Nuru, told NAN that Nigeria  should, at least for once, teach Cameroon a lesson over its  continued aggressive tendencies over the years. However,  another lecturer at the university, who declined to be named,  told NAN that it would be counter productive for Nigeria to go  to war with Cameroon over the matter as it would only worsen the  economic situation in both countries.</p>

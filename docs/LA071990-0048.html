			<p><P> July 19, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: HOLLYWOOD;  </P> <P> SENIOR CITIZEN RIDES TO START  </P> <P> A long-awaited shuttle bus service will begin Monday to provide low-cost  transportation for senior citizens to senior centers, medical facilities and  nearby shopping areas.  </P> <P> The three specially built 24-passenger DASH/Hollywood shuttles will run along  Fountain Avenue and Sunset Boulevard every 30 minutes from 9 a.m. until 6 p.m.,  Monday through Saturday.  </P> <P> They will make stops at existing bus stops marked with special DASH signs.  </P> <P> The fare will be 25 cents, compared to the more than $1 for a trip on a  Southern California Rapid Transit District bus.  </P> <P> Hollywood-area Councilman Michael Woo said he began efforts to get the shuttle  system about a year ago after senior citizens complained that they had trouble  getting around. City transportation officials spent several months determining  the best routes and how many shuttles were needed, Woo said.  </P> <P> The shuttle service is open to the general public, in addition to senior  citizens.  </P> <P> Woo said $250,000 in state Proposition A funds earmarked for local transit  programs will be used to finance the shuttle service. He and representatives of  seniors' groups will unveil the shuttles today in front of the Hollywood Senior  Multi-Purpose Center at 6501 Fountain Ave. at 11:15 a.m.  </P> <P> Woo will also host an outing Saturday at DeLongpre Park from 10 a.m. to 2:30  p.m. to unveil the magenta, white and blue shuttles. Residents are invited to  attend, obtain route information and enjoy free popcorn.  </P></p>

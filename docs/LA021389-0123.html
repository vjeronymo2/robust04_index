			<p><P> February 13, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> U.S. FAILS TO RESOLVE ISSUE OF AIDING JAPAN JET PROJECT  </P> <P> High-level talks among U.S. government agencies have so far failed to resolve  trade questions over proposed U.S.-Japanese cooperation on Japan's new FSX  fighter, Administration officials said today.  </P> <P> The Bush Administration is examining a decision made last year by the outgoing  Reagan Administration, which came after years of wrangling, to let General  Dynamics Corp. help Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries build a new jet based  on the General Dynamics' F-16.  </P> <P> But opponents of the proposed $8-billion deal, including members of Congress,  have cautioned that the cooperation would give Japanese aerospace industry a  major boost in its competition with U.S. defense firms.  </P> <P> Officials said a meeting held Friday on the FSX included representatives from  the White House, National Security Council, U.S. Trade Representative's office  and the State, Defense, Commerce, Labor, Energy and Treasury departments.  </P> <P> Published reports have said questions about the deal are being raised by the  Commerce Department and the trade representative's office. The Bush  Administration has not yet sent notification to Congress that it intends to go  through with the technology transfer deal.  </P></p>

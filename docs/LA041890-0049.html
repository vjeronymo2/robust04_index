			<p><P> April 18, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOOK REVIEW;  </P> <P> ACLU: A LAW FIRM UNTO US ALL  </P> <P> IN DEFENSE OF AMERICAN LIBERTIES: A HISTORY OF THE ACLU by Samuel Walker Oxford  University Press $24.95, 479 pages  </P> <P> Is the American Civil Liberties Union a "criminals' lobby," as former Atty.  Gen. Ed Meese once called it?  </P> <P> Samuel Walker's "In Defense of American Liberties," an authoritative and  exhaustive history of the ACLU, demonstrates that Meese was dead wrong: If the  ACLU is a lobbyist, its only real client is the Bill of Rights. Indeed, the  ACLU is more nearly a jurisprudential SWAT squad that rolls out whenever our  liberties are threatened.  </P> <P> As Walker describes some of the ACLU's most controversial crusades -- on behalf  of Nazis, PLO sympathizers, pornographers and the Ku Klux Klan -- we are  reminded that its vigilance and its willingness to advocate unpopular causes  have been repugnant even to some of its most ardent supporters. But the fact  remains that the rest of us enjoy the luxury of taking our freedom for granted  precisely because the ACLU is so tenacious in protecting the rights of the  friendless and the despised.  </P> <P> As early as 1917, we learn, the civil libertarians who later created the ACLU  were dismissed as a "little group of malcontents" when they championed the  dangerous idea of freedom of speech during wartime. (The New York Times warned:  "Jails are waiting for them.") Essentially the same slander was at work more  than a half-century later when George Bush dismissed Michael Dukakis as "a  card-carrying member of the ACLU" in the 1988 presidential elections.  </P> <P> But Walker makes it clear that the ACLU is not a militant organization that  takes to the streets or the barricades, although its current membership exceeds  270,000. Rather, Walker depicts the ACLU as "the nation's largest law firm," a  network of thousands of "cooperating attorneys" throughout the United States  who are handling a thousand cases at any given moment. Some 80% of "the  proverbial 'landmark cases' " in American constitutional law, according to  Walker, are the result of the ACLU's quiet, sober and diligent work in the  courts.  </P> <P> "With some justification, the ACLU can claim to have shaped contemporary  values," argues Walker. "When the ACLU was founded in 1920, the promises of the  Bill of Rights had little practical meaning for ordinary people. Today, there  is a substantial body of law in all the major areas of civil liberties. . . .  The ACLU can legitimately claim much of the credit -- or be assigned the blame,  if you prefer -- for the growth of modern constitutional law."  </P> <P> "In Defense of American Liberties" is what I would call a semi-official  history; Walker, as he is quick to point out, serves on the board of directors  of both the ACLU and its Nebraska affiliate, and he was an active participant  in some of the very cases and controversies that he describes. And, since  Walker's book is a work of legal and institutional history, the prose is  densely packed with names, dates, acronyms, factional politics and the  metaphysical nuances of law and politics.  </P> <P> At times, Walker appears to be too generous or too circumspect about his  forebears and fellow activists in the ACLU. For example, he admits that "the  ACLU's greatest failure during the cold war was turning a blind eye on the  FBI." He even concedes that Morris Ernst, one of the ACLU's most influential  and even beloved leaders, was "the FBI's advocate in the ACLU." But he does not  fully confront recently discovered evidence suggesting that Ernst was perfectly  willing to sell out Julius and Ethel Rosenberg by joining their defense team  and acting as an FBI informer. (William L. Shirer, whose memoirs were recently  reviewed in these pages, makes similar charges against Ernst.)  </P> <P> Of course, it's impossible to argue with Walker's observation that "the  revelations from the FBI files were a ghost from the past, a relic of an era  and an ACLU that were long gone." Walker concludes: "If anything, the ACLU's  attitude (toward cooperation with the FBI) had swung radically in the opposite  direction."  </P> <P> As I read "American Liberties," I was reminded of Pastor Martin Niemoeller's  poignant warning against remaining silent when only the rights of others are at  stake: "Then they came for me," Niemoeller recalls of the day when he, too,  fell victim to the Third Reich, "and by that time, there was no one left to  speak up for anyone."  </P> <P> Indeed, Walker's book is especially instructive in a era when so many nations  and peoples are struggling to build democracy on the ruins of a failed  totalitarian empire. If America is a light unto the nations, it is only because  of the courage of men and women of conscience, including the members of the  ACLU, who are willing to speak up for even the least popular and least  appealing among us.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by special envoy David Aponte on an interview with </F> Subcommander Marcos of the Zapatist National Liberation Army by  unidentified reporters in Lacandona jungle on 9 April]    [Text] Lacandona Jungle, Chiapas, 9 Apr -- Rebel leader  Subcommander Marcos announced today that the Zapatist National  Liberation Army (EZLN) says the "political and military"  conditions are not right for them to continue discussing the  government's proposals within the Indian communities, in search  of dignified peace in Chiapas, or to resume talks with Peace  Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis.    He said the Clandestine Indian Revolutionary  Committee-General Command (CCRI-CG) is demanding that the  Mexican Army cut back its presence in the region and that  livestock breeders and ranchers suppress their belligerence in  order for the talks to resume.    The EZLN military strategist also said the rebels have heard  nothing from Manuel Camacho Solis -- either privately or  publicly -- as previously stated by the former foreign minister.    In an interview with three reporters in a clearing in the  Lacandona jungle, the subcommander commented on Camacho Solis'  public reappearance and on his views on the peace process.    On Friday, the commissioner, speaking to representatives of  the three branches of the government, reaffirmed his commitment  and his position on a political solution to the armed conflict.  He also mentioned that new steps will be taken in the next few  weeks aimed at building peace.    Basically, Marcos believes that "political and military"  conditions are not right for the resumption of talks. He  charged that the Mexican Army is conducting new troop movements  into new areas in the region.    [Marcos] "What they did was to move them out of the press'  way. They retreated across the flank the press covers, namely  Tuxtla Gutierrez, San Cristobal de las Casas, Ocosingo,  Altamirano, and Las Margaritas. Some of them came around  Arraiga, and the others came through Villahermosa and Tenosique.  Five days ago about 30 8.5 ton trucks came down from Tenosique  along the border highway, transporting about 1,000 or 1,200  soldiers."    [LA JORNADA] Don't you think this is just movement of troop  replacements?    [Marcos] This is within the replacement. What they do is to  relocate the parachute and sapper units; they get them out of  the press' way and place them in the rear. The paratroopers are  counterguerrilla rangers [preceding word in English]. In  military terms this means sappers and paratroopers in the rear;  thereby the hammer and anvil operation is inverted. It would  now be on the border and the anvil here.    "I believe here they have too much at stake and the game is  to penetrate the woods (the Lacondona jungle), control the road  and from there position the anvil. I do not think they will  risk positioning the anvil in Ocosingo, Altamirano, and Las  Margaritas because this would be too obvious and they do not  want this."    [LA JORNADA] What are they thinking of then? Is this an  offensive tactic?    [Marcos] Isolation, removing the guerrillas as spokesmen on  society. They want us to stop making statements; they want us  to stop doing what we are now doing. They want to take us out  of these woods. Nevertheless, the troop movements here have to  be very quick to force us out of here. What was planned  previously on this side -- that is to move in the sappers and  the paratroopers who are the green berets -- was to defuse the  mines. These are counterguerrilla units who come in to clash  and to locate us.    "The units used are from 12-15 [not further explained]. We  are talking about approximately 5,000 men, a division. This is  an airborne division, following the gringo model of a rapid  intervention.    "Therefore, initially they move in this direction, Ocosingo,  Altamirano, Las Margaritas, on the landing fields here. The  landing field of Altamirano was refurbished while all commercial  flights from Las Margaritas landing field were stopped. There  they have set up a garrison from where they start to push us to  over there (the border with Guatemala). Over there is located  the anvil, in this case it would be the Kaibiles (elite unit of  the Guatemalan Army). At this point, the Mexican Army eases up,  and there they would force us to confront the Kaibiles. The  Kaibiles then apply the anvil.    "To this end, they publish in the media that the soldiers  have left; the reporters see them passing through San Cristobal  de las Casas. Nevertheless, they turn back and then change  troops."    [LA JORNADA] Is the government playing both sides? Camacho  said he coordinates the interests of peace, in reference to the  cattle breeders.    [Marcos] Yes, I believe he is going to attempt to include  the  cattle breeders somewhere in the dialogue. They had already  intended to talk to us as they know very well that we have not  yet invaded the farms. Maybe they want to take advantage of  this to reach an agreement and solve the problem of the cattle  that was the war tax and to somehow negotiate land ownership.    "Meanwhile, the Army supposedly continues to ease military  pressure. What it is really doing is maintaining it at the same  level. It is not compartmented; it simply has changed strategy.  This is the last report I received yesterday (Friday)."    [LA JORNADA] This is not clear. What does the government  want? Does it want to continue with the dialogue, or is it  preparing for a final offensive?    [Marcos] It does not want to continue with the talks; what  are now suspended are the talks. They want to know what the  communities are going to say, and they want to maintain the  military presence. They are waiting to see the results of the  talks, to then ease the military pressure and begin  negotiations."    [LA JORNADA] Do you believe you will continue with the  dialogue if the conditions exit?    [Marcos] No. Right now the conditions do not exist. We  thought they were since the committee had been noticing the  withdrawal of soldiers, but their departure was not confirmed.  Reports from our front line indicated that (the soldiers) were  not leaving. Later we received reports that they were coming  through another place. Since there was no movement in the rest  of the country, we figured out that it was just the same  soldiers moving from one place to another.    "Thus far, the situation has not changed. Colosio's slaying  was the pivotal factor in the suspension of the talks. We said:  There is the perfect excuse. Seemingly, it is now when it is  becoming clear that it is not our fault, and there is an  internal government plot. We can hold the talks with that  (military) tactic in place so long as they do not have a legal  basis to attack us..."    [LA JORNADA] Is it true that you met with Camacho Solis a  few  days ago?    [Marcos] No. I have not seen Camacho since the talks, and it  is not true that he has sent any secret communiques. If he did,  they have not arrived. We have not heard from Camacho since the  talks. He was awaiting the results of the talks. We went along  with the process; then Colosio was assassinated, and the whole  thing was suspended. We had heard he was coming (to Chiapas).  However, I have not had any contact with him, either written,  public, or secret.    [LA JORNADA] Why are they saying that?    [Marcos] The government is waiting to see how the situation  evolves. Colosio was their alternative in the negotiations.  After Colosio's death, they must readjust to decide what they  will offer or negotiate.    [LA JORNADA] Under what conditions will you resume the  dialogue and come down to the cathedral?    [Marcos] In order to resume the dialogue, some military  conditions must exist. One is that the Army reduce its  presence. Another condition is a decrease in aggression -- at  least until the dialogue is resumed -- on the part of the  cattlemen, businessmen, and the political class. This  aggression seemed to come mainly from the municipal presidents  and the cattlemen. Obviously, Salinas' resignation would be a  welcome sign.    [LA JORNADA] Is it true that you want to speak to Zedillo?    [Marcos] No. I have never said... I could give you some  advice on how to write textbooks, but I never said that. The  committee has not held a meeting since it was appointed, and it  is very possible that it will not support any of the candidates.    "I had already given up on the idea of the candidates coming  here. We will not invite them anymore, but we are willing to  talk with a representative. For that matter, we are willing to  talk with any representative. What truly matters to us is that  they come here because if something happens to them, if a plane  crashes... What I have said is that we are willing to talk  with any candidate, but I did not think they would come because  if something happened to them, they would blame us. Seeing as  how Colosio was killed, we can expect anything to happen to any  other candidate."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Abu Dhabi, 10 Jun (MENA)--'Abdallah al-Asnaj, deputy  prime minister and foreign minister in the government which was  recently declared in south Yemen, has said that President 'Ali  'Abdallah Salih has not complied with the cease-fire decision  which he conveyed to UN envoy Lakhdar Ibrahim. The cease-fire  was scheduled to take effect at 1800 Yemen time.    Al-Asnaj, who is accompanying Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas,  envoy of 'Ali Salim al-Bid, on his visit to Abu Dhabi, told a  MENA correspondent in the United Arab Emirates that the areas of  Darb al- 'Amr, Khormaksar, (al-Mu'lla), al-Tawahi, al-Hiswah,  al-Burayqah, and al-Waht are being subjected to missile attacks  and heavy artillery bombardment at the rate of three missiles  per minute. He said that the bombardment is still going on.    Al-Asnaj said that well over 700,000 citizens in Aden became  homeless when the pumps for drinking water, power generators,  ports, and residential areas came under bombardment. He said  that the situation in Yemen is deteriorating due to the  continuation of the war launched by the Sanaa regime. He  pointed out the south is complying unconditionally with the  cease-fire decision.    Al-Asnaj urged the international community to provide the  citizens in Aden, Lahij, and Abyan with drinking water,  medication, and food.    Al-Asnaj accused military experts from Iraq and Jordan of  being involved in the Yemeni war, adding that the war machines  of north Yemen are completely under the control of these  experts. He said that seven Iraqi experts have been taken  prisoner by the southern forces and that 20 Jordanian experts  have been seen at the Sanaa Air Base.    Al-Asnaj urged the international and Islamic worlds to  support the sons of Yemen in the south and to condemn the  aggression against them. He said that Abu-Bakr al-'Attas and  his delegation will later leave for Hadhramaut to meet with UN  envoy Lakhdar Ibrahimi. He added that he will return to Abu  Dhabi on his way to the United Nations to follow up on the  report that will be submitted by Ibrahimi to the UN secretary  general.</p>

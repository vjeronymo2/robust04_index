The author steeped himself in the situation in  Anhui Province, bringing to light various erroneous  understandings of macroeconomic agricultural policy that reveal  the crux of China's agricultural problems. It is hoped that this  report will arouse more discussion.    From mid-April until the end of June, we conducted an  on-site  survey in rural Anhui on behalf of the Ministry of Agriculture.  In the course of this survey, we strove to analyze completely  and systematically the classic problems of a classic large  agricultural province like Anhui with a view to arriving at some  correct policy conclusions for solving various deepseated  incongruities and problems.  <H5>  1. Current Status of Agricultural Production </H5>   Anhui Province has plentiful agricultural resources. It is a  major area for the production of agricultural products such as  grain, cotton, edible oil, hemp, and hogs. During 14 years of  reform, its agricultural production has developed fairly  rapidly, increasing by an average 6.4 percent each year between  1979 and 1990. Following an especially severe flood in 1991, the  goal set by the provincial CPC committee and the provincial  government of "recovering in one year from one year of disaster"  was substantially attained in agricultural production during  1992. Outputs of most agricultural products revived to normal  levels.    The guiding thought for agricultural production throughout  the province for 1993 is to emphasize a market orientation.  While ensuring steady increase in the production of grain,  cotton, and edible oil, major efforts are being made to change  the structure of agriculture, active developing readily salable  products, and promoting "two high and one premium" [high yield,  high returns, and premium quality] agriculture. The structure of  farming throughout the province is to be diversified in 1993.  This includes a slight reduction from 1992 of the 88 million mu  sown to grain, substantial cutbacks in the area planted to  cotton and oil-bearing crops, and an expansion of the tuber,  corn, soybean, peanut, sesame seed, melon, fruit, and vegetable  growing areas.    The main problems in Anhui's agricultural production today  are as follows:    1. Accompanying the high speed growth of the national  economy  has been a widening of the gap between the speed of development  of industry and agriculture. Agricultural and rural resources,  including money, land, and large amounts of manpower have flowed  into nonagricultural pursuits, into cities, and into coastal  areas of the country. Thus, efforts to warm up and stabilize  Anhui's agriculture are doomed to failure. During 1992, 1.5  billion yuan flowed out of Anhui Province's industrial and  commercial system into developed coastal areas. Money from 50  percent of agricultural unit bank accounts in the provincial  Bank of Agriculture flowed into other banks or financial  institutions. More than 23 million yuan from the Bank of  Agriculture Business Office in Hefei left. During 1992, 195  different development zones were built throughout the province.  These reduced the cultivate land area by more than 300,000 mu.  This was the greatest decrease in the cultivated land area since  1987. During the winter of 1992 and the spring of 1993,  approximately 5 million members of the rural work force  (approximately 20 percent of the total) left to work elsewhere,  most of them going to Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai. A survey  of 16 counties and cities shows that 115,300 peasant households  gave up the farming of 346,600 mu of land. Unless this overly  rapid shift is brought under control, another shortage of farm  products is extremely likely to occur.    2. Expansion of demand for intermediate investment drives a  rise in prices of agricultural means of production. At the same  time, however, the prices at which peasants sell their products  have not risen greatly; thus, the price scissors has widened  further. Between January and May 1993, prices of agricultural  means of production throughout the province rose 12.5 percent  over the same period in 1992. However, the price that peasants  received for major farm products such as grain remained  basically flat, except for rapeseed, which enjoyed brisk sales  and the price of which rose approximately 15 percent over 1992.  Despite the adoption in 1993 of several policies to nurture  agriculture, peasants continue to report that they lose money  farming. They are extremely unhappy particularly about failure  to control rises in prices of means of production like chemical  fertilizer and diesel fuel. In addition, provincial departments  concerned report that because of the anticipated increase in  diesel fuel prices, the provincial petroleum company is unable  to buy from east China companies sufficient quantities of diesel  fuel for agriculture at the parity price. Between January and  April, only 37,800 tons of parity price diesel fuel was  obtained. This is only 28.8 of annual plan. As of 15 June, only  5.5 percent of the entire year's parity price oil had been  provided.    3. The bumper summer grain harvest in 1993 does not  demonstrate a warming of agriculture. This is because the main  reason for the increase in summer grain production was a 2.5  percent increase over 1992 in the area sown to grain. Second,  heaven helped out; weather conditions were better than in the  previous year. The weather during the late stage of the growing  season was particularly fine. It played a decisive role in the  heading of the wheat and the bumper harvest. However, the  peasants actually invested less. Provincial supply and market  cooperative sales of chemical fertilizer, agricultural  pesticides, and agricultural plastic were down 4.4, 27.5, and  21.3 percent from the previous year. Retail sales of  agricultural means of production for the province as a whole for  the first four months of the year increased only 2.3 percent  over the same period in 1992. After deduction for price  increases, sales volume showed a further decline. Comparison of  sales during the period January through May with the same period  in 1992 shows an 18.7 drop in chemical fertilizer sales, a 1.6  percent decline in agricultural pesticide sales, and a 42.5  percent fall in sales of agricultural plastics. In addition, a  survey of the spring planting preparations of 7,750 households  in 31 counties all over the province shows purchases of chemical  fertilizer, seeds, agricultural pesticides, agricultural  plastic, and diesel fuel as running at between 43.1 to 67.4  percent of the same period in 1992. The situation reported by  provincial agricultural survey teams also shows an actual  decline in expenditures for agricultural production among  peasant expenditures for the first quarter of 1993. It is  noteworthy that the direct reason for the reduced peasant  investment is not a shortage of supply, but mostly a rise in  prices of the means of production. In addition, as a result of  natural disasters in Anhui during the past two years, peasant  income has declined. Some peasant families have no money to  spend. They may want to invest, but they cannot pay. Their  spirit is willing, but their flesh is weak.    4. Investment in agricultural infrastructure is  insufficient;  reserve strength is lacking for steady growth of agriculture.  Expenditures for agriculture in the provincial Seventh Five-Year  Plan fiscal budget (including expenditures to support  agricultural production, payments for agricultural, forestry,  and water conservation projects and investment in capital  construction, and expenditures to assist undeveloped areas)  amount to only approximately 10 percent of total government  expenditures. As a result of major natural catastrophes in 1991,  government investment in agriculture rose to 13.7 percent, but  in 1992, it returned to the lowest point since implementation of  the Seventh Five-Year Plan at only 9.06 percent. It is expected  that no increase will occur during the next two years because of  limited financial resources. Basically, the 1992 level can only  be maintained. Furthermore, the percentage of fiscal budget that  prefectures and counties apply to agricultural production shows  a basic trend toward decline except in major disaster years.  <H3>  2. Policy Climate Not Favorable to a Large Agricultural  Province </H3>   (1) Contributions of a Large Agricultural Province    Anhui Province was the place in China in which rural reform  began. Following the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Party  Central Committee, it was the peasants in Anhui Province who  first demolished the shackles of the old system to take the lead  in implementation of the family output-related contract  responsibility system, which raised the curtain on China's  surging rural reform. During the past 14 years of reform,  profound changes have taken place in the good earth along the  Chang Jiang and the Huai Jiang. Anhui Province's economy and  undertakings have developed by leaps and bounds. The main  national economic statistical indicators show a speed of  economic development in Anhui that cannot be considered slow.  During the decade of the sixth and seventh 5-year plans, annual  increase in Anhui Province's GNP, national income, social gross  output value, gross output value of industry and agriculture,  and gross output value of agriculture were all greater, in  varying degrees, than the national average.

During 1992. 46.2 percent of the province's revenues derived  from the agricultural sector. This was 11.5 percentage points  higher than the national average. Anhui ranks seventh among  China's provinces, autonomous regions and directly administered  municipalities in the percentage of revenues derived from  agriculture after Tibet (63.6%), Hainan (60.0%),  Guangxi  (52.1%), Jiangxi (49.6%), Inner Mongolia  (46.6%), and Hunan  (46.4%). The province's township and village population  in 1992  accounted for 82.1 percent of the total. Urbanization was 8.47  percentage points lower than the national average.    Anhui Province is one of the country's main agricultural  production regions, and it is also one of the small number of  provinces having the potential for great agricultural  development. Anhui Province's output of major agricultural  products holds an important position nationally. In 1990, Anhui  ranked seventh among the country's 30 provinces, autonomous  regions, and directly administered municipalities in gross  output of grain, seventh in gross output of cotton, fourth in  gross output of oil-bearing crops, second in output of hemp,  tenth in gross output of meat, and tenth in net purchases of  agricultural and sideline products. Each year Anhui Province  ships large quantities of agricultural and sideline products to  other provinces, making an enormous contribution to the economic  development of east China and the country as a whole.    In 1978, Anhui was still a net recipient of grain shipments,  but implementation of the household output-related contracting  system released agriculture's potential. Grain output increased  year after year. During the so-called period of limbo in grain  production elsewhere in the country during the 1980s, Anhui's  grain production continued to grow year by year. In 1978, the  province's grain output totaled 29.65 billion jin. In 1979, it  broke the 30 billion jin mark; in 1983, it broke the 40 billion  jin mark; and in 1990, it broke the 50 billion jin mark at 50.4  billion jin, advancing three steps in 12 years. The provinces  rate of increase in grain output was 1.4 times that of the  country as a whole. In 1979, Anhui Province became a net shipper  of grain, the amount shipped increasing from the very earliest  several hundred million jin and a few billion jin to more than 6  billion jin during the 1980s. Between 1985 and 1990, the  province's grain system alone shipped an average of 5.55 billion  jin of grain each year. After deducting two-thirds of the 50  billion jin per year of grain that the province produces for the  peasants' personal use, plus 17 billion jin of commodity grain,  and 6.7 billion jin for grain system fixed procurement for the  province, and the portion that the grain system sells in other  provinces (this portion amounting to 25 percent of the amount of  grain sold within the province), for a total of approximately 9  billion jin of grain, in most years the province can ship more  than 8 billion jin of grain to other provinces. Anhui Province  is currently only one of seven net grain shipping provinces. In  1990, per capita grain production was 445 kilograms, or 55  kilograms higher than the national average of 390 kilograms. In  some new grain producing areas such as Chuzhou City, per capita  grain output amounts to more than 882 kilograms. This is one of  the areas in the country having fairly high elasticity in grain  supply.    (2) Contrast Between Contribution and Income    Although Anhui Province's growth rate during all of the  1980s  cannot be considered low, this is only in terms of gross output  value and gross output indicators. If national economic net  output value and the main income indicators are examined, the  quality of Anhui Province's economic development has to be  greatly discounted. Likewise, growth rates for Anhui Province's  local government revenues, the average wages of staff members  and workers, and peasant per capita net income during the decade  of the sixth and seventh five-year plans were also lower than  the national average. (See Table 2).    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 2.

Naturally,  this fairly low increase in the net output value rate is  connected with the economic structure. The contributions to  national income of the development of basic industries and raw  and processed materials industries are far from those of  processing industries, in addition to which Anhui happens to be  a large agricultural province, a large raw and processed  materials province, and a large basic industries province.    Comparison of Table 1 and Table 2 also shows Anhui  Province's  rate of increase in the gross output value of agriculture and  grain output to be 1.09 and 2.29 percentage points higher than  for the country as a whole, yet the rate of increase in both  local government revenues and peasant per capita income are 1.75  and 1.35 percentage points lower than for the country as a  whole. These two pieces of data show that government revenues  and peasant income have not increased in step with the  development of agriculture and the increase in grain production.    Anhui's ranking in the country for peasant per capita net  income and per capita government revenue also clearly shows the  province is in the predicament of being a "large agricultural  province and a fiscally poor province," and that its peasants  "increase output but do not increase income." In 1978, peasant  per capita net income in Anhui Province ranked fourteenth in the  country, and fifth among the seven provinces and directly  administered cities of east China (ahead of Shandong and  Jiangxi). The super normal growth of agriculture during the  initial period of rural reform stimulated a sharp rise in  peasant income, peasant per capita income in Anhui Province  zooming to eighth place in the county, an all time high. Later  on, for various reasons, its ranking decreased year by year,  reaching twenty-first place in 1990, and last among the seven  counties and directly administered municipalities of east China.  In 1991, when the province sustained a flood of more than once  in 100 years proportions, peasant per capita net income fell to  thirtieth place among the country's 30 provinces, directly  administered municipalities, and autonomous regions. Despite the  rebounding increase of 1992, it stilled ranked only  twenty-seventh in the country, just above Shaanxi, Guizhou, and  Gansu. A look at its income indicator shows that in 1990 Anhui  ranked twenty-fourth in the country in per capita national  income and national income accumulation. Its city and  countryside residents' consumption level ranked twenty-sixth;  per capita wages of staff members and workers in state-owned and  collectively owned enterprises ranked twenty-seventh; per capita  fiscal revenues and expenditures ranked twenty-ninth, and by  1992, average per capita government revenue stood at only 95  yuan for twenty-ninth place in the country, or above Tibet  alone. Per capita government expenditures stood at 100 yuan for  last place in the country. In the course of this Anhui survey,  some old cadres who are extremely well informed about Anhui told  us emotionally that the people of Anhui are outstanding and the  land is fruitful. It is also a well endowed region that lacks  nothing, so why did economic development end up in this  predicament? The gap between Anhui and developed provinces is  becoming wider and wider, money is flowing away, and talented  people are leaving. It is really hard to bear! We also heard  people say that on a television station contest about knowledge  of the country, the master of ceremonies asked: Which province  in the country ranks last in economic strength? The contestant  replied: Anhui! The master of ceremonies said: Exactly right.  Add 10 points! How out of keeping this income ranking and  heartfelt anxiety of the people is with Anhui's contribution to  the whole country as a major agricultural province, and Anhui's  place in the country in output of major agricultural products!    (2) Relationship of the Government, Finance and  Banking, Enterprises, and the Peasants to Grain Production    Agriculture is an industry that produces high social and  ecological benefits, but low economic returns. From the cadres  at the top to the peasants at the bottom in Anhui Province, all  have quietly made a contribution to ensure agriculture's steady  growth and ensure completion of the political task of providing  grain effectively. However, we can see from the analysis that  follows that under the existing system the development of  agriculture and the promotion of grain production resulted in  government, finance and banking, grain businesses, and the  peasants shouldering a heavy burden. Objectively, this became a  detrimental factor limiting the economic development of the  whole province.    1. Fiscal weakness became fiscal subsistence. The disparity  between government receipts and expenditures in Anhui Province  is fairly glaring. Despite the numerous measures adopted in  recent years to increase revenues and reduce expenditures, the  problem of inability to make ends meet has become increasingly  serious. As of the end of 1992, the provincial government  deficit stood at 1.178 billion. Governments at all levels in the  province have a hard time coping. More than 70 percent of the  province's 72 counties (or cities) show a deficit. More than  half receive subsidies, and only by milking special purpose  funds can they get by.    Because of straitened financial circumstances, government  spending is increasingly in disarray, meaning the frequently  talked about eating at the expense of building. Reportedly more  than 80 percent of all government expenditures in the province  are for people. Limited financial resources are used on  supporting people, but the percent spent on increasing  production is less than 20 percent. Each year only about 1  billion yuan is spent on production. Not only is this amount  lower than the between 2 and 3 billion yuan that Jiangsu,  Shandong, and Fujian spend, but it is even lower than the 1.4  billion yuan than Jiangxi spends. Investment in increasing  production is grossly inadequate, and conversely this inadequacy  limits economic development. Not only this, but economic  backwardness means limited employment opportunities. Each year  the province has to provide for between 30,000 and 40,000  military personnel returning to civilian life and university  graduates. In the end, they can only be thrust into  administrative units. This single requirement eats up more than  half of the annual increase in financial resources. In every  county that we visited in the course of this survey, it was  common to find that cadres at the primary county and township  levels had not been paid for several months.    Fiscal hardship and destitution is directly related to  Anhui's being a large agricultural province. No more fiscal  revenues can be obtained from the agricultural tax, the  agriculture and forest special products tax, the cigarette tax,  and other agricultural products processing taxes; thus, revenue  sources are limited. This means that fiscal revenues are unable  to keep pace with the growth of agricultural product processing.  Furthermore, in order to maintain essential investment in  agriculture, each year something must be squeezed from limited  financial resources for investment in agriculture from which  there can be virtually no direct return. In addition, so long as  the price scissors exists between industrial and agricultural  products, Anhui stands to lose more than several hundred million  yuan on the shipment of large quantities of agricultural  products out of the province in exchange for large shipments of  industrial goods into the province.    In addition, the government must heavily subsidize grain.  Statistics show 7.4 billion yuan spent for government grain  subsidies between 1980 and 1991, 2.6 billion yuan or 35 percent  of it coming from local governments. During the past three  years, the charging off of grain business losses has increased  greatly, amounting to 2.647 billion yuan as of the end of 1992.  This has become a glaring problem bedeviling both the government  and grain businesses. As a key grain producing province, Anhui's  grain output increased year after year, but not only have local  treasuries obtained no benefit from this increase, but their  burdens have increased. Analysis of data from Shouxian, one of  the highest output provinces in the country, shows a  relationship between grain production and fiscal revenues.  Between 1978 and 1984, there was a direct relationship; between  1985 and 1989 there was a weak relationship, and after 1990  there has been a negative relationship. This further intensifies  the vicious cycle of subsistence finance.    2. The low operating efficiency of the Bank of Agriculture  has turned it into a "procurement bank." As was said above, a  serious credit gap exists in the Anhui provincial banking  system. Demand for money is much greater than supply. Take just  the provincial Bank of Agriculture system, for example, in which  the level of savings is less than the national average but the  scale of lending steadily increases thereby steadily widening  the credit gap. In 1980, the provincial Bank of Agriculture (not  including credit cooperatives) had a credit gap of 1.18 billion  yuan. By 1992, the credit gap had widened to 10.1 billion yuan,  and by the end of April 1993, because of further decline in  savings, the credit gap further widened to 10.4 billion yuan.    Faced with enormous money supply and demand pressures, the  Bank of Agriculture's funds are used entirely for agriculture,  particularly for meeting the rigid policy requirement of  providing funds for state procurement of agricultural products.  This is manifested in a fairly large percentage of the Bank of  Agriculture's credit being for operating funds, and a fairly  small percentage being for production. Operating funds loans  account for two-thirds of the Anhui Provincial Bank of  Agriculture's loans each year. Only one-third are loans for  production. At the end of 1992, 65.6 percent of outstanding  loans were operating funds loans, 49.9 percent of them loans to  grain businesses. Production loans (including agricultural  credit and township and town enterprise credit) accounted for  only 33.6 percent. This ratio is just the opposite of developed  coastal provinces (such as Jiangsu Province). In 1993, Bank of  Agriculture credit plans increased 1.98 billion yuan, 1.1  billion yuan or approximately 55 percent of which was an  increase in agricultural products and by-products procurement  credit. Consequently, comrades in the provincial Bank of  Agriculture laughingly term themselves the "Procurement Bank."  The province's 1993 goal of realizing a township and town  enterprise output value of 80 billion yuan will require an  additional 6 billion yuan investment in fixed assets, but 1.9  billion yuan of this is unavailable. Pressures on the Bank of  Agriculture are very great from all side, but the Bank of  Agriculture system has long since shown itself to have more  difficulties than it can handle.    An even more serious problem is that the high percentage of  credit extended for policy reasons (more than 70 percent of it),  plus system and management problems create an increasingly  serious burden on the limited funds of the Anhui Provincial Bank  of Agriculture in the form of a siphoning off of funds. As of  the end of 1992, irregular loans accounted for 9.38 billion yuan  of the 24.97 billion of the credit balance of the Bank of  Agriculture system throughout the province (including credit  cooperatives). This was 37.6 percent of the loan balance! Of the  irregular loans, 48 percent were overdue loans, 46 percent were  stagnant loans, and 6 percent were bad debts. Moreover, of the  irregular loans, the irregular loans of just grain businesses  totaled 3.7 billion yuan, or 56.2 percent of the 6.58 billion  yuan in loans extended to them. This was 39.5 percent of all  irregular loans. Such a large siphoning off of money not only  intensifies the already very acute funds shortage, but also  increases the banks burdens immeasurably making it difficult for  them to cope.    3. Grain businesses are mired in a predicament; they have  become major losers. As the main grain and edible oil  procurement and marketing channels in a large agricultural  province, Anhui's state-owned grain system's fate is closely  link to the production and marketing of grain. They reflect in a  concentrated way all the conflicts in the existing grain  procurement and marketing system.    The golden age of Anhui Province's grain system began in  1983  when losses began to be turned into profits (thanks to fixed  subsidy contracting), and it lasted until 1989. During this  period profits were maintained year after year, the peak year  being 1989 when profits amounted to 128 million yuan. However,  beginning in 1990, the province's grain system once again  incurred severe losses. Losses for that year reached 980 million  yuan (657 million yuan more than total profits for the previous  seven years). Thereafter, losses amounted to 1.15 billion yuan  in 1991, and 110 million yuan in 1992. For the period January  through May 1993, losses were 250 million yuan. After  subtracting the treasury-subsidized portion, the province's  grain system losses pending totaled 2.57 billion yuan. In 1993,  Anhui Province ranked fifth after Hubei, Hunan, Heilongjiang,  and Jilin provinces among the country's 30 provinces, directly  administered municipalities, and autonomous regions in the size  of losses. By the end of 1992, losses on account advanced to  2.647 billion yuan. Additionally, at least one-tenth of the  grain currently in storage is over age and has mildewed. This  means even greater potential losses.    Faced with such enormous book losses, the provincial grain  sector concludes from an audit that 92.8 percent of them are  losses resulting from loans made for policy reasons. The  remaining 7.2 percent are losses on loans made for business  reasons, but the treasury has yet to accept this accounting. The  main reason for grain businesses' book losses since 1990 are:  grain price distortions, the more grain procured the greater the  losses; a sharp change in grain supply and demand, negotiated  price grain being purchased at a high price and sold at a low  one; the high cost of building granaries, and of storing and  transporting grain; tremendous rise in bank interest rates; the  sale at parity prices of grain purchased for storage at a higher  than the parity price, failure to recover grain loaned to the  people, and the increased cost of rescuing grain from granaries  in low-lying areas during flood years; failure to recover funds  paid to peasants in advance for grain, and government failure to  pay subsidies owing, etc.    The severe debt burdens of grain businesses not only make it  hard for them to function as the main channels for grain sales  but also produces three-way bickering that draws in public  finance and holds the banks hostage. This produces an uproar in  the macroeconomic regulation and control system that causes  losses in development of the entire economy. Ultimately, it is  the peasants who must bear this "cross."    4. Structural changes occur slowly, the peasants increasing  production without increasing their earnings. For the above  reasons, it is difficult to allocate all of Anhui Province's  resources for effective structural reforms. Unlike at the  beginning of reform, even though the province's economy has  undergone a certain amount of change, it still lags greatly  behind the average level for the country as a whole. Comparison  of 1990 with 1978 shows a 3.1 percentage point decline in the  agricultural portion of Anhui Province's social gross output  value, and a respective 4.5, 2.0, and 0.5 percentage rise in the  industry, construction, and transportation portion (with an  extraordinary 3.9 percentage point decline in the commercial  portion). However, a lateral comparison shows the agricultural  portion as 10.2 percentage points higher than the average level  for the country as a whole, and the industry, construction,  transportation, and commercial portions to be a respective 8.0,  0.6, 0.8, and 0.9 percentage points lower than the average for  the country as a whole. Anhui still clearly exhibits the  backward economic structure of a large agricultural province.  The internal make-up of agriculture, in particular, has changed  only extremely slowly during the past decade. Its structural  change value is 7.8 percentage points lower than for the country  as a whole (See Table 3) (Footnote: "Structural change value" is  an indicator showing the extent of structural change. It  consists of the difference between the various occupations  making up agriculture [e.g. farming, forestry, etc.] for the  reporting period and the various occupations making up  agriculture for the base period, the differences in these  structural ratios then being added up to produce an aggregate  absolute value). Even more astounding is that the structure of  agriculture in Chuzhou City, which this survey covered, has seen  virtually no change in more than 10 years.    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 3.

Analysis of peasant earnings in Anhui Province shows  two marked characteristics: First, the lion's share of total  earnings comes from agriculture, and the lion's share of income  from agriculture comes from grain farming. Furthermore, this  income make-up has changed but little over the years (See Table  4). Since the percentage of income coming from other than  agriculture has always been small, this is one of the reasons  for the slow growth of peasant earnings.    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 4.

Comparison of peasant per capita net  income in Anhui Province with the country as a whole shows 1985  as the year when the difference was least at only 5.20 yuan.  Thereafter, the gap widened with each passing year until 1990  when per capita peasant income in Anhui was 147.10 yuan behind  the average for the country as a whole. Furthermore, the  difference was greatest in two years during this period: 27.10  yuan in 1984, and 61.30 yuan in 1990. As is well known, these  two years happened to be the ones when "difficulty selling  grain" occurred everywhere. In addition, Anhui's peasants suffer  greatly from the price scissors. The peasants call the price  scissors "the fire tongs," whose effect on them is truly more  real than for the peasants in developed provinces.    Most of the peasant households we surveyed reported no  improvement in there lives in recent years. They had no assets,  and peasant households everywhere owed debts. In moderately  economically developed Jiashan County, for example, peasant  indebtedness is 210.50 yuan per capita or about 1,000 yuan per  family. Most peasant households have to go into debt in order to  farm and live.    Thus, we have depicted the various aspects of Anhui's  economic development as it relates to grain in terms of public  finance, finance and banking, grain businesses, and peasant  income. Now the problem is just how the economic development of  a large agricultural province such as Anhui ended up in this  destitute predicament. To attribute Anhui's backwardness and  difference from the country as a whole solely to historical  factors, or to blame it on the truly grievous losses from the  great flood of 1991 is not convincing, we believe. This can  neither explain why neighboring provinces are in a better  position nor explain the 1990 data that is constantly quoted in  this report. The fact is that there is no lack of provinces like  Anhui. Without except, other large agricultural provinces such  as Jilin, Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi face the same difficulties  and problems that Anhui faces. This demonstrates that even  though the importance of agriculture to the national economy is  constantly reiterated, a different logic operates in real life,  namely that those who develop agriculture and develop grain  production are the ones who suffer! This logic is manifested not  only in the peasants "increasing production without increasing  income," but is also exhibited in local public finance, finance  and banking, and businesses, thereby seriously limiting the  optimum allocation of resources through the entire economy.  Close study leads to the conclusion that this is a major  institutional reason why the economic development of all large  agricultural provinces becomes mired in straitened circumstances.    The reason we have taken great pains to detail the various  examples in Anhui Province that illustrate this point is not  only concern about the inevitable results of the foregoing  logic, but also because we want to point out that this logic is  inevitably attributable to a certain policy environment. In this  sense, we feel that Anhui provides is a classic example. We can  use this classic example to examine the formulation of  macroeconomic agricultural policies and analyze the reasons why  policies are not diligently carried out.  <H3>  3. Reasons Why Central Government Policies Are Not Carried  Out </H3>   The only way for Anhui Province to get out of its economic  predicament lies in more rapid readjustment of its industrial  structure, However, in overall terms, how to maintain steady  growth of agriculture while changing the economic structure is a  strategic issue that must be conscientiously addressed. Thus,  one basic principle in drawing up macroeconomic policy should be  to do whatever helps different jurisdictions make the most of  their own resources potential and economic strengths, creating a  policy climate that is consistent with this. Otherwise, policies  will be detrimental to economic development and detrimental as  well to the coordination of overall strategy. Therefore, the  problems with existing policies and how to adjust and solve them  was also an issue the pros and cons of which we repeatedly  examined in connection with whether policies were or were not  implemented during this survey.    One point about which we had a strong feeling during this  survey was that a marked difference exists between central  government policy goals and Anhui Province's own policy goals on  the issue of developing agriculture. Proceeding from the needs  of overall national economic development, the central  authorities more greatly require that large agricultural  provinces like Anhui provide more agricultural products in order  to support structural changes in the economy as a whole.  However, proceeding from the reality of its own economic  backwardness, Anhui Province strongly demands that changes in  the industrial structure be intensified to narrow the gap  between Anhui and developed provinces. It has less interest in  developing agriculture to satisfy needs outside the province.    In explaining the reasons for these different policy  choices,  one cannot simply fall back on the usual reason of a conflict  between what benefits the country as a whole and what benefits  one part of it. The fact is that, to a very large extent, Anhui  Province's choice is based on the realization that it is the  policy climate that is responsible for an agricultural province  getting the worst of things. Thus, the essence of the matter is  that actual economic policies do not reflect the importance of  agriculture. The differences between the central government and  local government policy goals are actually a reflection of this  real conflict.    The problem is that if agriculture cannot really obtain the  protection it should have, public finance, finance and banking,  business enterprises and the peasants not only gaining no  benefit but actually suffering losses, who has any interest in  developing agriculture? The pointedness of this question, given  the policy climate, lies in various interest groups not only  having no interest in developing agriculture but, insofar as  they act rationally, inevitably coming to regard agriculture as  a burden to be gotten rid of! This is also the most basic reason  why a series of plans, policies, and specific measures that the  central authorities have framed have either not been implemented  or have been distorted in implementation.    Specifically, the understanding of the situation we gained  from this survey suggests reasons at many levels and in many  regards for the failure to implement agricultural policies. In a  nutshell, they are mostly problems in the following several  regards:    1. The detrimental effect of the macroeconomic economic  climate. Agriculture is not an isolated system. It is closely  related to the overall operation of the national economy.  Consequently, implementation of agricultural policies frequently  depends on more than just efforts within the agricultural  system. The external climate is also an important, and sometimes  a decisive, factor. Since 1992, the national economy has entered  a new period of high speed growth in which industry has seen  high speed growth, but in which large amounts of rural economic  resources such as money, land, and manpower have been lost,  investment demand has expanded dramatically, the price scissors  has widened further, and agricultural labor opportunity costs  have risen. This has been accompanied by turmoil in finance and  banking and in the commodity circulation order, and the  surfacing of various social contradictions that lay latent in  rural villages, all of which created enormous pressures on the  steady development of agriculture. Without a cooling of the  external economic climate under these circumstances, it will be  very difficult to put in place a series of new policies of the  central government regarding agriculture and rural villages. No  matter the effort made, only half the results will be obtained.  For example, raising of the "two funds" will be difficult,  procurement funds will be diverted to unauthorized purposes, and  reduced peasant burdens will increase again, etc. The problems  will show up in rural villages, but there roots are in the  external environment. Therefore, limiting the implementation of  policies solely to agricultural and rural villages will not  work. The proportional relationship between industry and  agriculture must be fundamentally altered to create a minimum  normal economic order. This is the only way to get the basic  conditions needed for the implementation of agricultural and  rural policies.    2. Skewed orientation of policy formulation. Some of the  policies being inaugurated today not only do not protect the  interests of agriculture and the peasants, but are detrimental  to them. This shows up mostly in the formulation of some reform  measures that are clearly motivated by public finance's desire  to get rid of burdens. An example is the new grain production  and marketing policy, which substitutes charges not included in  the price for the former "three link-ups." This was a move in  the right direction, but the situation that ensued suggests that  the basis for figuring the price difference was far too low. The  peasants had to find more money to pay for the same quantities  of chemical fertilizer and diesel fuel. An even more glaring  example is the "weaning" of public finance from technical  service organizations. Since both institutional reform and  delegation of the "three authorities" stubbornly and arbitrarily  emphasized "weaning" and streamlining, Anhui Province's  grassroots level agricultural technology sector was dealt a  mortal blow, which forced agricultural departments to operate  some business entities having nothing to do with their function.  This meant that every day agricultural technology personnel had  to rush around to make a living, which produced a "five  reductions" situation of less organizational support, personnel,  operating funds, facilities, and services. It even resulted in  inability to perform regularly the most basic tasks of providing  early insect warnings and livestock and poultry inoculations.  The spread of agricultural techniques takes a long time, yet it  is indispensable to progress in agricultural technology. In  addition, given the current level of development of peasant  households in which "service for payment" generally applies only  to specialized households and to some areas and links in  agricultural production, mindless insistence on "weaning" and  "service for payment" not only leads to taking benefits from the  peasants, but also is bound to have serious consequences for the  development of agriculture. Thus, it is very necessary to  examine closely similar so-called reform measures today, clearly  understand and set forth the relationship between building of a  market economic system and protecting agriculture, resolutely  correcting some erroneous ways of doing things and deviations.    3. Some policies are inoperable. The original intention in  drawing up some policies is good, but because of failure to  integrate policies, failure to take the total situation into  account, and failure to investigate situations in detail, their  operability is poor; they cannot be implemented. Just a few  examples are provided here:     -  The grain floor price system. Although announced two years  ago, neither the central government nor provincial governments  have yet set up a grain risk fund system for the grain floor  price system. Consequently a grain floor price simply cannot be  put into effect. Thus, in the absence of a source of price  differential subsidies, the more grain that grain businesses  buy, the greater their losses. They must either pay the peasants  less or limit procurement. Not only are the interests of  grain-growing peasant hurt, but confidence in policies is  undermined.    -  Ceiling price for means of livelihood. This is limited only  to ex-factory prices and not to market prices, in addition to  which supply and marketing cooperative's private ownership  reform practice of "renting out the shell, and selling the meat"  [zu kezi, mai rangzi] has increased the difficulty of policing  ceiling prices, the ceiling price policy existing in name only.    -  The "two funds" policy. The original intention of this  policy was to support peasant grain and cotton production, but  returns from this policy far from offset the cost of and losses  from its operation. Both grain and supply enterprises have no  interest in its diligent enforcement.    -  Procurement funds specialized household control. This  generally applies only to the first issuance. Once procurement  funds have begun to circular, two problems are encountered at  once. One is that when money withdrawn from circulation on sales  made for the purpose of regulating the market is settled among  the various specialized banks, it is frequently garnished  instead of being returned to specialized households. Second,  grassroots operating units must divide up the money taken out of  circulation among multiple People's Bank outlets at a higher  level. The links are numerous and procedures are  complicated.       Some of these kinds of operating problems can be improved in  practice, but in some cases revisions are needed, more  thoroughgoing reform measures taken.    4. Some policies are changed shortly after they are  announced  rendering their implementation impossible. During the survey,  comrades at the grassroots level reported this situation in many  regards. For example, the central authorities have already  clearly announced a change in the method of linking grain sales  to the provision of three kinds of goods in 1993, charges not  included in prices to be paid to the peasants in cash. But  recently, the province received a notice from the central  government informing it that the portion of the differential  price for fertilizer for which the central government bears  responsibility will not be paid for in cash but with goods. It  permits local governments themselves to decide whether to supply  goods or cash for their portion. The reason given is that  imported chemical fertilizer is accumulating in inventory. Local  government comrades are very unhappy about the offhand way in  which policies come out in the morning only to be changed by  nightfall. Repeated changes of announced policies leaves  implementers with the problem of how to provide an explanation  to the peasants. Another matter is the issuance of rubber  checks. During 1988 and 1989, for example, the State Council  authorized the China National Cereals, Oil, and Foodstuffs  Import and Export Corporation to regulate special purpose grain,  which permitted Anhui Province to purchase nearly 1.3 billion  jin of trade grain. It was initially agreed to pay a .022 yuan  per jin storage fee for all grain not shipped after half a year.  However, to date, less than 200 million jin of grain has been  shipped and not a cent has been paid for storage fees.  Provincial grain departments must spent an additional more than  25 million yuan each year in storage fees. In 1991 and 1992, the  state also decided to apply a concessionary policy for the  procurement of negotiated price grain, providing a subsidy of  .03 yuan per jin. It made arrangements to purchase 600 million  jin of rice from Anhui Province. The grain was purchased, but  the national treasury refused to pay the bill. The subsidy  remains unpaid to this time. The grain departments had to  advance 18 million yuan for this purpose. The offhanded way in  which policies are applied are also expressed in arbitrariness  and misinterpretations. An example is the definition of the area  to which no issuance of IOUs is to apply in the procurement of  agricultural products. The spirit of the central government  intent was clearly all agricultural products that the peasants  sell, but acting in the spirit of the national financial  administration conference, financial units limited it only to  fixed procurement items.    The "modification" of policies actually reflect the rigid  interests of different sectors to the point where they take it  upon themselves to revise, accept or reject, and distort central  government policies. This has become an "intestinal  obstruction": in the implementation of government decrees.    Lack of separation of government administration and  enterprise management, and institutional impediments are also  one of the causes of policy distortions. While realizing that  government policies are frustrated by the interests of certain  sectors, one must also recognize the existence of problems in  other regards as well, namely that at the time policies are  drawn up, insufficient account is taken that certain aspects of  the system for their implementation itself is changing as part  of reform. Instead, traditional administrative methods continue  to be followed. For example, units such as the specialized  banks, grain, and supply and marketing departments continue to  discharge numerous functions for policy purposes while they are  also engaging in reforms to change their operating systems. They  are in process of partly or completely changing from being  administrative agencies to operating like business enterprises.  While in this process, enterprises own business character and  the continued discharge of functions of a policy nature creates  inherent contradictions and clashes. Therefore, until such time  as government administration has been completely separated from  enterprise management, and during the designated period when  policy and business functions continue to be centralized in a  single entity, if the policies we formulate fail to take account  of the profit and loss situation of the interests in the system  that is to enforce the policies, which is in process of becoming  a business, and if there is no mechanism for recompensing losses  for the implementation of policies that an organization of a  business nature incurs, resistance in the implementation of  policies will be difficult to avoid. If the losses that grain  and supply and marketing businesses incur in the discharge of  tasks for policy purposes are commingled with business losses,  whatever the treasury should pay for or has no way of knowing  what to pay for the banks will be allowed to suspend. This will  not only disrupt relations among grain dealers, banks, and the  treasury (actually the treasury will incur a bank overdraft  through the suspension of a grain enterprise account), but since  you will not acknowledge the business character of grain  dealers, supply and marketing units, and the specialized banks,  you actually tacitly permit them the right to haggle with the  government. In such situations, our policies themselves  frequently become the best bargaining chip; consequently,  policies are frequently sacrificed under such a system.  Therefore, unless relations between the government and business  concerns are straightened out, policy functions and the business  functions handled separately, many of are policies will remain  in their infancy. A fate for them other than anticipated will be  a foregoing conclusion.    6. The incompleteness of rural grassroots organizations and  institutions is also a reason why policies are not put into  effect. Virtually all of our rural policies must ultimately be  implemented by a township or village organization. The situation  found in Anhui Province suggests that difficulties in  implementing many policies are directly related very greatly to  the incompleteness of grassroots organizations and institutions.  As was said above, the "single account book" for finances at the  village level that exists in all rural villages in Huaibei  County is a main institutional reason why the "two funds" do not  reach peasant households, and why peasant burdens are so heavy.  Since the contracting of production to individual households in  these places, the development of various kinds of cooperative  economic organizations that transcend peasant households has  been slow. The collective economy is weak, and various  democratic procedural systems that the peasant self-rule law  provides for have not even been broached. Village cadre  allowances are the responsibility of the villagers, and this  conflicts with the cadres' role of doing the government's  bidding. This is manifested very glaringly here. In addition,  cadre caliber is low and work style is poor. This makes for  tense relations between cadres and the public and not very  vigorous policy implementation.    7. Arbitrary policies mean that in large agricultural  provinces, the spirit may be willing but the flesh is weak in  carrying out policies. This situation shows graphically the need  for the local treasury to provide money for the implementation  of some policies. As was said earlier, the financial resources  of the large agricultural province of Anhui are rather weak.  Following implementation of the system of dividing revenues and  expenditures between the central and local governments and  holding each responsible for balancing its own budget,  agriculture suffered more here than in developed provinces.  Under these circumstances, until central government policy is  tilted somewhat in favor of large agricultural provinces, these  provinces financial burdens will increase. Thus difficulties in  implementing policies will increase, and ultimately there will  be no way to implement them. An example is the national grain  production and marketing policy newly inaugurated in 1993, many  provisions of which will require local governments to spend  money. This includes a change in the method of providing goods  associated with the sale of grain in the "three link ups." Local  governments will have to pay 100 million yuan in subsidies.  Local governments will have to put up 100 million yuan for grain  reserves. After grain prices were decontrolled throughout the  province on 1 April, the failure to solve grain businesses'  longstanding problems will mean losses of 300 million yuan. In  addition, allowances paid to administrative unit staff members  and workers will require between 900,000 and 100 million yuan.  For these several items alone, local treasuries will have to  obligate 600 million yuan. This is 11 percent of fiscal  revenues. This does not even include the setting up of a grain  risk fund and dealing with the pending need for funds of grain  agencies. Furthermore, the central government has decided to  deduct over a 3 year period the 600 million yuan special grain  subsidy paid provinces, and this 600 million yuan is only enough  to pay a single year's new payments for grain, never mind  eliminating the losses pending from previous years. In such a  situation in which revenues do not cover expenditures, for new  grain production and marketing policies to suggest that "local  government may suitably increase added value standards as their  financial resources permit, local government treasuries bearing  all increased expenses" is a wish that can even less be talked  about. In the investment field, too, the central government also  frequently resorts to a proportional division of investment  among local jurisdictions. When such a method is applied to the  harnessing of large rivers -- projects of significance for the  entire country -- (such as the Huai He river system's new Hui  and Hong rivers), it is rather unreasonable. Not only does it  intensify the inequality of wealth of different jurisdictions,  but since the local government of large agricultural provinces  cannot pay such sums, assessments must be levied on the  peasants. This becomes, in turn, a main reason for the increase  in peasant burdens in traditional agricultural areas.    To summarize the foregoing, we realize that the inability to  implement some central government agricultural policies is not  just a failure of vigorous enforcement. It also depends on  whether the drawing up of these policies was itself a correct  move, whether the policies are workable, whether the gains and  losses of the system charged with their implementation have  considered and corresponding measures adopted, and whether the  external climate is favorable. For large agricultural provinces,  the problems are even more complex. They have to bear more  directly pressures coming from all sides, and implementation of  policies is hobbled by more serious conditions. Therefore,  greater effectiveness of our agricultural policies requires  efforts in many regards to improve our operating system.</p>

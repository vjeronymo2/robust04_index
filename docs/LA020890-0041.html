			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PREP SOCCER ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> TIE GIVES EDISON, OCEAN VIEW SHARE OF SECOND PLACE  </P> <P> After 139 minutes of scoreless soccer, Ocean View High School broke through for  a goal against Edison in a Sunset League boys' match Wednesday at Ocean View.  </P> <P> Edison, the second-ranked team in the county, and No. 7 Ocean View had played  100 minutes without a goal in their first league match.  </P> <P> So when Peter Lak headed in a direct free kick by Greg Biggins in the final  minute of the first half Wednesday, it seemed that that might be the winning  goal.  </P> <P> But Edison's Mike Hawks tied the score early in the second half on a pass from  Brian Higgins and each team scored once in overtime. The final result was a 2-2  tie that left the teams tied for second place with 5-1-3 records behind Marina  (7-2 in league) with one match remaining, on Friday. Marina was a 2-0 winner  over Fountain Valley Wednesday.  </P> <P> Edison (13-5-5 overall) scored first in overtime when Higgins set up Hawks with  another assist. Ocean View (13-4-5 overall) tied it with near the end of the  first 10-minute period, when Scott Bauer threw a pass from the sideline that  Andrew Wind headed into the goal.  </P> <P> "Was that a great game or what?" said Ocean View Coach Paul Kollar. "Back and  forth, up and down the field. That was an outstanding game." MARTIN BECK  </P></p>

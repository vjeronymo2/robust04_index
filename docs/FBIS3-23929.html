			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Report by MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI staff correspondent Viktor </F> Kiyanitsa: "The Right of Way"]    [Text] The election campaign to the new Supreme  Council was officially launched in Kazakhstan last week. From  the very first days of a month-long election marathon, the pulse  of public life quickened perceptibly--which, strangely enough,  has not found an adequate reflection in the local mass  media.    Television in Kazakhstan is not flooded with ads  proclaiming,  "Better with us than with Snickers." Newspapers are not filling  their pages with candidates' endless political platforms. It  appears that the Central Electoral Commission has learned from  the sad experience of the Russian campaign. Paid political  advertising is banned. All candidates are in equal starting  conditions: Each is entitled to 10 minutes of free television  time and 100 lines in the republic press to present his program.  But this is not the only reason of the relatively low political  activism of the press. Paradoxical as it may sound, it is quite  often busy with things other than big politics. Most daily  newspapers in the republic come out three times a week lately.  And some are suspending publication altogether. There is no  paper, no money for printing and delivery--a difficult economic  situation. The republic leadership untiringly emphasizes that in  Kazakhstan, where more than 500 periodicals are registered,  there has not been a single incident of a "coerced" closing of a  newspaper. Only "natural mortality" as a result of economic  difficulties. What is interesting, however, is that it is  primarily the state and quasi-state mass media that had been  suffering most from economic difficulties. The very large  newspaper KAZAKHSTANSKAYA PRAVDA--a former Central Committee  organ--finished last year "owing" the readers about 30 issues,  although one would think that it should feel itself in a  privileged position, having as a cofounder--along with the labor  collective--the Cabinet of Ministers. The mighty cofounder,  however, reminds of its existence mostly only after another  "unpleasant" article, when the newspaper is duly reminded that  it is a state organ and must defend state interests!    One of the latest such reminders was an official letter to  the editor in chief from the republic's Ministry of Publishing  and Mass Media. Among other things, it contains a list of  subjects which, in the ministry's opinion, "may constitute"  state secrets. The list is long and not very comprehensible.  Some items in it simply contradict current legislation. For  instance, "it is not recommended" to reveal data on the state  gold reserves. At the same time, the law on the monetary system  prescribes the National Bank to issue at least once a month  information on the gold and foreign currency supply that  supports the tenga. Actually, this is not even a full list. No  one in the editorial offices has seen the full one. The  newspaper's senior management reminiscences almost wistfully  about the times of Glavlit [the Main Administration for  Safeguarding State Secrets in the Press], when each editor had  in his safe a list of items that constituted state secrets. Now  the ministry suggests: "Call for guidance before publishing...."    More often, however, the ministry itself takes the  initiative  in calling and advising. They may recommend that some or other  rubric be started, to "cover a topic." There was an incident  when the newspaper was "advised" to put a certain headline in  the next issue.... According so some data--so far unofficial--a  draft for creating some sort of state-owned "press holding  company" is in the works in the bowels of the administrative  structures. The state will own the controlling share of stock  and will thus get a real lever of managing newspapers' policy as  well as the ability to appoint and remove editors in chief.  Actually, even today the logogriph "independent newspaper" on  the front page does not guarantee complete independence from the  state. Just recently, Dauir, the largest publishing house in the  republic, where many "independent" newspapers are printed,  refused to print about 30 of them with the lowest circulation.  The pretext for refusal was that several presses needed  preventive maintenance. By strange coincidence, "preventive  maintenance" coincided with the beginning of the election  campaign.    The list of "low-circulation" newspapers included the  popular  KARAVAN newspaper, with a circulation of 200,000. This happened  after KARAVAN and the businessmen's newspaper ABC published a  very biting open letter from the president of Krands--the  largest state corporation--to the mayor of the capital. On the  day this issue came out, the city fire inspectorate sealed the  printing house facilities. Later, electricity was cut off there  several times....    Someone wants very much literally to implement the famous  journalistic postulate: A newspaper's life is one day.</p>

			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / World Bond Markets: Tokyo Japanese government bonds rebounded on Friday when the Bank of Japan's quarterly Tankan survey showed business confidence was growing, but at a modest rate. The yield of the benchmark 10-year bond fell to 4.58 per cent, ending the week at the lowest level in two months. Non-government bonds also gained, with 4 per cent bank debentures trading at 4.04 to 4.05 per cent, compared with 4.075 per cent on Thursday. Friday's announcement that, for the first time since the war the government would finance a bail-out of two failed savings institutions, was viewed as positive for the bond market and sparked an early rally. This was further supported when the Tankan later confirmed traders' expectations that the business recovery was restrained. Other credit union type savings institutions in Japan, which have been crippled by a potentially lethal infusion of bad debt, are likely candidates for future rescue operations. If credit were tightened now, such rescues would be much more difficult and costly. The Tankan showed some improvements in the environment for corporate financing and the BoJ predicted that credit would remain easy for corporate borrowers. Major companies polled in the survey plan to cut capital spending by another 3.9 per cent after two consecutive years of decreases.</p>

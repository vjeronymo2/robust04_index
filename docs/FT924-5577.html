			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / Sunday trade pressure fear TWO THIRDS of retail companies opposed deregulation of Sunday trading but the same proportion believes competitive pressure would force them to open if the Shops Act were repealed, according to new research from Cambridge University. The research, released by the Keep Sunday Special lobby group, found that 44 per cent of shops surveyed were already opening on Sunday, particularly larger ones, and 36 per cent of employees reported having worked at least one Sunday in the previous year. Half the shops surveyed by the Small Business Research Centre and the Centre for European Legal Studies at Cambridge thought their profitability would decline as a result of Sunday trading and only 10 per cent thought it would increase. The main finding of the research is that present employment legislation is unlikely to guarantee shopworkers the right not to work on Sunday or to receive a wage premium for Sunday working if controls on trading hours are removed. At present, most shops are paying double time for Sunday work, but that is likely to become less common if Sunday becomes just another working day, the researchers say. Over 90 per cent of employees surveyed said they did not welcome the opportunity to work on a Sunday and a similar proportion favoured formal legal protection against having to work on Sunday.

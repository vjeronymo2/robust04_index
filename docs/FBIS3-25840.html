The regulation, which is aimed to stress implementation of  the compulsory education law, noted that at the beginning of  each semester, parents and guardians of school-age children must  ensure that the children enter school to receive compulsory  education.    The compulsory education period in China lasts nine years  including six years for primary school and three years for  junior secondary school.    Beijing adopted an educational inspection system in 1986.  Now 14 counties and districts in the city have set up  educational inspectors' offices.    Recently, the Beijing municipal government appointed a group  of new educational inspectors to supervise the implementation of  the compulsory education law in the city.    Song Baozhang, one of the inspectors of the Beijing  Municipal  Education Bureau, said that there are now 1.46 million  youngsters who are studying at primary schools and junior  secondary schools in Beijing.    The schooling rate at primary schools in Beijing reached  99.9  percent and the rate at junior secondary schools was 99.92  percent, Song said.</p>

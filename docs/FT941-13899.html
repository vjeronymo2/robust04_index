			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Skiing: White-outs and bolt-holes Fresh snow is a little like make-up - it can hide the wrinkles of the starkest ski resort and make it appear snug, cosy and even attractive. Tignes, great ski area that it is, has always had an unfortunate reputation for being ugly, which I never thought it fully deserved, even without snow. But then, ugliness is in the eye of the beholder. Having seen Tignes recently with almost more snow than it knew what to do with, I found myself feeling quite affectionate towards it, especially up at Val Claret, where a magical circle of bars and restaurants provided a nightly welcome as we waded through the ever-increasing snowdrifts from our self-catering apartment in Hameau du Borsat. (Somehow, despite one's best intentions, self-catering apartments never produce much in the way of catering when competing with the smell of garlic wafting in from nearby restaurants.) Because Tignes is above the tree-line, skiing through almost constant snowfall can become quite wearing after a couple of days, and eating out becomes especially comforting. During our stay, the best snow was high on the Grande Motte, now quickly accessible via the gleaming yelow and blue 'caterpillar' funicular which rushes dizzily through rock and ice to the top in seven minutes. Here we enjoyed a rare treat - a break in the weather which allowed the sun to hover in a cloudless blue sky. It was suddenly so warm that we were able to bask outside the Restaurant Panamarique and soak up the inspirational scenery before an exhilarating descent back to Val Claret. We didn't enjoy such luck the following day: attempting a similar run, we were enveloped in a white-out and had to ski virtually blind. At times like this, shelter and lunch loom large in your thoughts and we found a tasty bolt-hole. The 600 students battling it out in the British Universities' Ski Championship did not enjoy quite the same options: come blizzard or white-out, they carried on at a relentless pace and it came as no surprise that the Scottish contingent - used to skiing in all weathers  - dominated the proceedings. The only regret was that cheering them on  - or even seeing them - was well nigh impossible. Such was the concentration of snow that even a visit to neighbouring Val d'Isere had been fraught with difficulty. However, we made the effort and crawled down in our game little car where we bumped into Martin and Graham Bell, still ski-racing for Britain after all these years. Alberto Tomba, the Italian slalom ace, is another regular visitor and Charles Arnould, director of the Hotel Latitudes, told us that he had been let loose in the kitchen to cook his own pasta. Arnould recalled: 'We tried to persuade him to let us cook it for him but he was adamant. It's the same whenever he vistits us, he always insists on cooking his own pasta.' Perhaps Tomba and I should swap accommodation next time we are in the area: he would make good use of a self-catering apartment and I would love to be cooked for and waited on hand and foot at a four-star hotel. Travel arrangements and accommodation in Tignes for Arnie Wilson, the 600 racers from 40 universities, plus 700 other non-racing students, were made by Touralp (UK) Ltd, tel: 071-602 1952</p>

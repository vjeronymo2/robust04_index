			<p>BFN     [Text] Khartoum, 19 May (MENA)--Egyptian Ambassador to  Sudan Hasan Jad-al-Haq today lodged a strongly worded protest  with the Sudanese Foreign Ministry following the Sudanese  authorities' seizure and closure of Egyptian buildings and clubs  in Khartoum.    The Sudanese authorities today seized the Egyptian Club in  Khartoum and prevented its Sudanese and Egyptian members from  entering. They also seized clubs and buildings belonging to the  Egyptian Irrigation Authority in Sudan and the Egyptian military  attache in Khartoum.    The Sudanese authorities gave no reasons for these measures.  The measures began in December 1992, when the Sudanese  authorities seized Egyptian education mission schools, the Cairo  University branch in Khartoum, and the Egyptian Nasir's Club in  the Sudanese capital.</p>

The ministry's main conclusion is that "no radical,  strategic  changes should be made in the government's course," senior  ministry official Mikhail Kopeikin told Interfax. But more  emphasis should be put in the 1993-95 government program on  social security measures, he said. Those proposals "largely  correspond to what is suggested by Academicians Leonid Abalkin,  Stanislav Shatalin and others," although the Economics Ministry  disagrees with those who argue that the social security policy  should be set out in the first section of the program and all  further changes should depend on it, Kopeikin said. "We are  against changing the structure of the government program," he  said.    The social security measures proposed by the Economics  Ministry include penalties for the violation of minimum social  security guarantees, concrete measures to help the poorer  population strata and the involvement of nongovernmental bodies  in the financing of the social security policy.    The ministry also stands for tighter state control of the  economy, Kopeikin said.    He said he was a member of a group, formed recently and  headed by Deputy Economics Minister Sergei Vasilyev, which was  working on a list of priority financial, economic, social  security and other measures to be taken within the next two to  three months. All proposals made by the group, which had its  first sitting on February 12, would be sent to the prime  minister, Kopeikin said.</p>

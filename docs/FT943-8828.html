			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Reed Elsevier set to reveal Davis package Reed Elsevier, the Anglo-Dutch information and publishing group, is today expected to announce details of a compensation package for Mr Peter Davis, its former co-chairman. The announcement follows lengthy negotiations between the group's lawyers and actuaries, who have been working on the package since Mr Davis resigned in June over changes in management responsibilities. Although Reed Elsevier declined to disclose the sums involved, city analysts believe he could receive up to Pounds 800,000 in cash, along with lucrative share options and pension benefits. The company, however, described weekend reports valuing the final compensation deal at more than Pounds 2m as 'pure speculation'. Mr Ian Irvine, who replaced Mr Davis as co-chairman, said: 'The package is well within the legal maximum that could have been paid under the terms of his contract.' His predecessor was on a three-year rolling contract and earned almost Pounds 640,000 last year, including performance-related bonuses. Speaking after the group announced its interim results last week, Mr Irvine pointed out that the package had been adjusted for 'mitigation' - reflecting the likelihood of Mr Davis securing another job. Reed Elsevier decided to make a separate announcement on the compensation because 'we felt it was much better to link the act as closely as possible to the cost of the act', Mr Irvine added. Mr Davis resigned after Reed Elsevier's executive committee decided that the co-chairmen should concentrate on strategy, management development and corporate communications - leaving responsibility for the operating business to other committee members.</p>

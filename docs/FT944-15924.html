			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / Minding Your Own Business: Cast in a survivor's mould - A look at a company which has weathered several storms It could not be more different from the exclusive galleries of Bond Street or St James's, or the hushed rooms of an art gallery. Pangolin Editions' main foundry, at Chalford, near Stroud, Gloucestershire, is a cacophony of sound: 9,000 sq ft of hangar-like building, in which members of the 29-strong team are sawing, grinding, hammering and performing the myriad operations involved in working bronze. Casting bronzes for Britain's estimated 2,000 full-time and part-time sculptors is complicated. It involves mould-making, wax-making, firing, pouring, fettling and chasing - all processes that have to be performed in several stages. The labour-intensive nature of the business is one of the main reasons why three of the handful of British companies in the field went out of business last year. 'At one stage we thought we would be joining them,' said managing director Rungwe Kingdon, who founded Pangolin 9 1/2 years ago. Kingdon, 34, and his wife, Claude, run a business with a turnover of Pounds 650,000 but which makes little money. 'If I wanted to be a rich man I would not be in this business,' said Kingdon, who can remember first wanting to cast bronze at the age of eight. As a teenager he was influenced by his father, writer and sculptor Jonathon Kingdon. When the family returned to this country from Uganda - his father had been professor of fine art at Makerere University and gave his son the name of an African volcano - Kingdon went to art college before joining sculptor Lynn Chadwick, a lifelong influence, to learn the business. After four years he set up his first foundry in his father's backyard in a village near Oxford. 'By then I had decided that I did not want to be a second-class sculptor, but, as I had always suspected, to concentrate on bronze casting,' said Kingdon. His great interest then, as it still is, was on patination - the creation of different finishes, usually by chemical means, on the surface of the finished casting. After three years in Oxfordshire he bought a 2,000 sq ft section of a former asbestos works on an industrial estate at Chalford and soon became the head of a 10-strong bronze casting team. The building cost Pounds 25,000, of which Pounds 15,000 was on a mortgage. 'It was a bargain. Twelve months later, in 1989, it was worth Pounds 125,000,' said Kingdon. The business built up quickly. Within two years Kingdon had nearly 200 sculptors as clients and a workforce of 27. To cast monument-size bronzes he rented an adjoining 9,000 sq ft unit, complete with overhead gantry, and looked forward to expanding an already promising order book. The bank was happy to lend him Pounds 100,000 to purchase equipment and to service the company's Pounds 30,000 overdraft. For Pangolin, Kingdon can date the arrival of the recession precisely. 'It was in the first few weeks of 1990. The orders just came to a halt,' he said. 'The international art market went flat. Within a few months the value of the building we owned had dropped to Pounds 50,000 and our overdraft was running at Pounds 75,000. Our debts were not covered, and the bank knew it.' Kingdon was forced to make five people redundant. The rest of the workforce agreed to defer overtime payments, and sections of the newly-acquired main foundry building were under-used. A dispute with two employees led to an industrial tribunal - and a Pounds 5,500 payout he could not afford, and more headaches. For Kingdon it was the worst of four crises in as many years. The other three have centred on cash flow. 'Last year we turned over Pounds 650,000 and made virtually no profit,' Kingdon said. 'This year looks like being a little better - but I am still gradually repaying my staff for overtime worked several years ago.' Nevertheless, the business is surviving, while competitors have gone out of business. 'Pangolin is now one of four large bronze-casting foundries left in the UK and in terms of staff numbers and capacity probably the largest,' Kingdon said. 'Really there are too many people working here for the business to be really profitable. But our speciality is patinas - hand-finishing of bronze, which creates subtle hues of greens, browns, greys and blues, as well as black and white. If a sculptor is seeking a certain patina and wants a foundry that specialises in surface changes to the finished casting than he is likely to be more dependent on us than on others.' Pangolin has the capacity to cast large pieces. Last year three full-size bronze elephants, each weighing four tonnes, were cast. Other undertakings have included a full-size bronze of Captain Cook, which is to go to New Zealand. This summer the foundry undertook its biggest job yet - an abstract bronze sculpture in three parts weighing a total of 15 tonnes. In early September it was unveiled in Brussels as the centrepiece of the city's liberation celebrations. Kingdon attributes the expanding order book to the fact that the company is now known in the art world as a survivor, and to the training programme run by his artist wife that has helped improve quality and provided an experienced, stable workforce. 'We have also been regularly going to exhibitions and art fairs and this has helped bring in work from overseas. In the last 12 months we have probably done work for sculptors in a dozen countries,' he said. Gallery Pangolin has contributed to the company's survival. Under the same roof there is a permanent display of pieces loaned by leading sculptors. Opening is by appointment. Currently, a six-week exhibition is running and nearly all the pieces are for sale. 'The gallery is a sideline. Any money it produces goes into another catalogue and into our art fair fund,' Kingdon said. 'However it serves a useful function in promoting the work of our client sculptors and in showing what we are capable of.' Another reason for cautious optimism is the increasing volume of work the company is asked to do for archaeological teams and for research institutes. This usually involves testing theories on how historic artefacts were originally produced and finished. 'What the company really needs is money to buy some new equipment and improve our casting techniques,' Kingdon said. 'That would really put this place on the map.'

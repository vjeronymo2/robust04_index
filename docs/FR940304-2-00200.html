			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Technical Considerations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A major goal of the NII is the integration of networks. The TIIAP will not foster stand-alone, ``dedicated networks,'' that are incapable, for either technical or practical reasons, of interconnecting with other networks and systems. In part, applicants will be judged on the extent to which they plan to coordinate information infrastructure activities in their state, in neighboring states, or in the region. Applicants should address the technical aspects of their information infrastructure projects. Proposals should address interconnectivity, the capacity of one system to easily transfer digital information to another system, at the state, regional, national, and international level, as appropriate. Whether the information infrastructure will be expandable is another important issue. The standards, codes, and protocols that will allow for interoperability should be addressed in this section. Finally, the capacity for interactivity should be described in detail.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Partnerships  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NTIA will look favorably on joint applications from partnerships of two or more entities. For this reason, applicants should be aware of other relevant information infrastructure projects in the state or region. To the extent possible, applicants should plan to coordinate their projects with other relevant projects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Innovation and Experimentation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An overriding goal of the TIIAP is to foster innovation and experimentation in the uses and benefits that accrue from information infrastructure, while at the same time rewarding those projects which display innovative approaches to the problem of ensuring individual privacy. For this reason, the program will carefully assess projects from the perspective of technology or technologies deployed, current applications supported, and the potential for growth in the range of services provided. As noted above, NTIA expects applicants to consider carefully the status of the existing infrastructure; however, applicants should be willing, when appropriate, to experiment with new uses and applications of the information infrastructure supported under this program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Privacy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As noted above, NTIA expects applicants to consider carefully safeguards for the privacy of the information flowing through the information infrastructure funded through this grant program. While not mandating specifics, NTIA expects applicants to demonstrate a high level of respect for the privacy of users' information and data. Applicants proposing projects dealing with individually identifiable information will be required to prescribe mechanisms for protecting individual privacy. In addition, NTIA expects applicants to comply fully with all applicable privacy laws.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Eliminating Disparity of Access  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One of the key roles for government in the NII is to promote equity of access, so that the information age does not create information ``haves'' and ``have nots.'' Applicants should address how they intend to support the goal of promoting widespread access, and eliminating or reducing disparities in access, to the information infrastructure, consistent with the scope of the project. For purposes of this grant cycle, NTIA will look favorably on proposals that enable ordinary Americans to learn how to use, or benefit from, information infrastructure, without unreasonable burden or expense. Applicants should also consider how to train end-users in the use of information technologies. This section should address questions such as:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> How will the applicant's proposal help ensure end-user ease of access to the telecommunications infrastructure?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> How will the planning or implementation process encourage community development?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> How will the planning or implementation process address the issue of access to the information infrastructure by minorities, disadvantaged, or otherwise under-served populations?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

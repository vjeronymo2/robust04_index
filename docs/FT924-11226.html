			<p>921027 FT  27 OCT 92 / International Company News: DNO moves to build Nedlloyd stake DNO, the Oslo-based oil company controlled by Mr Torstein Hagen, the Norwegian investor, plans to strengthen the company's borrowing capacity with a view to increasing its 6 per cent shareholding in Nedlloyd, the Netherlands' largest transportation group. DNO's shares, suspended on October 5, were reinstated yesterday following a presentation of its capitalisation plan. The company is seeking to reduce exposure to the petroleum sector while establishing a sound financial basis for its development as an active marine investment company. 'This would include a somewhat greater ownership position in Nedlloyd,' it said. To achieve this goal, DNO said it would offer to convert bonds into shares and would seek the authority to issue shares directed at specific investors. The company said it had received a positive response from most of its convertible bond shareholders, representing a total outstanding of NKr168m (Dollars 26.95m), to convert the bonds into share capital. Through the conversion, DNO's equity-to-debt ratio would be doubled to slightly more than 50 per cent from 25 per cent. The group would issue 2m shares at a nominal price of NKr20 a share directed at specific investors. However, under Norwegian company law, DNO will first have to write down the par value of its shares to NKr10 from NKr100. This means the company's share capital will be written down to NKr52.50m from NKr525m. DNO is seeking to convert all its shares into voting shares in order to improve liquidity. The proposals will be put to shareholders at a meeting scheduled for November 9, but this should be a formality as Mr Hagen, through various cross-shareholding companies, represents the bulk of DNO's shareholders. DNO said it had held discussions with some of Nedlloyd's large shareholders about acquiring part of their shares in exchange for DNO shares. These had drawn a positive response, it said.</p>

			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / UK Company News: AAH spends Pounds 15m on acquisitions AAH HOLDINGS, the healthcare and distribution group, announced two acquisitions yesterday. It is paying up to Pounds 13m for ECE (Distribution Services) a specialist contract distribution company, and Pounds 1.8m for five pharmacies. ECE has six depots handling processed foods and the deal will treble the size of AAH's transport division. Mr Bill Pybus, chairman, said the acquisition switched the division's emphasis to contract distribution for manufacturers and retailers. ECE's pre-tax profits in 1991 were Pounds 2.6m and are forecast at not less than Pounds 2.3m for the year to March 31 1993. Net assets are Pounds 3.2m. Four of the pharmacies being acquired are on the Isle of Wight and one at Weymouth on the south coast. Net assets involved are not less than Pounds 300,000. They will take AAH's chain to 151 pharmacies. For the ECE deal AAH is paying Pounds 10.5m now with the possibility of another Pounds 2.5m in three years time depending on profits. For the two deals, AAH is issuing 2.54m shares of which 1.45m have been placed with institutions. AAH is also paying Pounds 690,000 in cash.</p>

			<p><P> April 18, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> IRS TROUBLE THREATENS BEARS OWNERS  </P> <P> The Halas family, owners of the Chicago Bears, could lose the football team  under a federal tax assessment that might surpass $50 million, according to a  report published Wednesday.  </P> <P> The Internal Revenue Service contends that the Halas family owes about $43.5  million in gift and inheritance taxes.  </P> <P> With penalties and interest, the tax bill could increase to more than $50  million, a sum the family could pay only by selling the team, a report in the  sports daily The National said.  </P> <P> Virginia Halas McCaskey, daughter of Bears founder George Halas, and Michael  McCaskey, Halas' grandson and president of the team, have filed petitions in  U.S. Tax Court in Washington challenging the assessments, The National  reported.  </P> <P> The family is also asking permission to pay any taxes the court rules it owes  in 10 annual installments, a request the IRS had already refused.  </P> <P> A trial was scheduled for May 15 before U.S. Tax Court Judge Lapsley W. Hamblen  Jr., the report said.  </P> <P> The dispute stems from a series of moves begun in December, 1981, by George  Halas aimed at passing on the franchise to his 13 grandchildren while avoiding  heavy taxation, the report said.  </P> <P> The IRS contends that a 1981 reorganization of the team placed an artificially  low value on the 49.35% of the team's stock then held in the name of the senior  Halas, who died Oct. 31, 1983.  </P></p>

			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / Labour strategy aims to stem industrial decline ENCOURAGING pension funds and building societies to channel personal savings into industry as well as property is one of the key proposals in a consultation paper on industrial strategy launched by the Labour party yesterday. Labour said that only a complete overhaul of British business practice could reverse the decline in the UK's manufacturing industry. The party wants to discuss with the pensions industry and building societies how their current legal position and investment practices might be altered to allow them to invest in the UK's productive capacity. The overall aim of the plans in the paper, Making Britain's Future, is to develop a longer-term approach to investment, in contrast to what Labour sees as the 'short-termism' of the City and the pursuit of growth through acquisition. Its other suggestions include tax incentives for companies; reform of takeover law to bring greater stability; and representation of employees on company boards. Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, emphasised that there would be thorough consultation over the coming months as the document was discussed with business, industry, professional associations and trades unions. 'Our aim is to reach the maximum consensus on the most successful way forward for British industry,' he said. The post-consultation version will be presented to the party conference in 1994, and will form the basis of Labour's industrial policy at the next election. While the paper includes some familiar Labour proposals, such as a training levy on companies which do not invest in skills, it also shows a shift in mood. The emphasis is on allowing and encouraging change rather than legislating to enforce it. The paper condemns the Tories for lack of commitment to manufacturing, and Mr Smith expressed scepticism at recent ministerial pronouncements that the economic recovery was under way. 'The test that we will be applying is: does unemployment come down?' he said. Mr Anthony Nelson, a junior Treasury minister, dismissed Labour's programme as a repackaging of the 'meddling and muddling' that had failed when the party was last in government. Sir Michael Angus, chairman of the Confederation of British Industry, welcomed the prospect of discussion of Labour's plans but warned there was no reason to think that ideas previously unacceptable to British business, such as employee directors, would be well-received now.

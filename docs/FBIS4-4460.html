			<p>BFN     [Text] The Central Agencies Bloc 1 party organization  convened a two-day midterm party conference from 29-30 March.  Comrade General Secretary Do Muoi attended and addressed the  conference.    The delegates evaluated the results of party-building work  in  accordance with the third midterm national party conference  resolution and discussed measures to ensure that party  organizations and party chapters fulfill two objectives  satisfactorily; namely, building themselves into units that are  firm, strong, and pure in terms of politics, ideology, and  organization and satisfactorily carrying out their political  role as advisers to the party Central Committee and state on  matters related to the implementation of the renovation process.    Regarding orientations and tasks for the next two years, the  conference set forth the following main objectives:    -- It is necessary to guide cadres and party members in  satisfactorily directing the implementation of each agency's  political tasks and intensifying efforts to make the party firm,  strong, and pure.    -- Steps must be taken to foil the peaceful evolution  strategy and encourage everyone to contribute toward the  successful implementation of the third midterm national party  conference resolution.    -- Measures must be adopted so that the entire party  organization fully grasps all party resolutions and state  policies and lines.    -- Efforts are needed to build firm, strong, and pure  party chapters in terms of both politics and organization.    -- Positive steps must be taken to fulfill satisfactorily  the party organization's advisory role in suggesting general  leadership patterns.    -- Special measures must be worked out to institutionalize  party policies and lines aimed at building the socialist  Vietnamese state into a law-governed state that belongs to,  comes from, and works for the people.    On behalf of the party Central Committee Political Bureau  and  Secretariat, Comrade General Secretary Do Muoi welcomed and  commended the Central Agencies Bloc 1 party organization for its  achievements during the first half of its term. These  achievements are positive contributions toward the common  success of the renovation process and the implementation of the  seventh party congress resolution.    He stressed: Because of the fact that a large number of its  personnel work with organs in charge of providing support  services to the party Central Committee, state, National  Assembly, and government agencies, the Central Agencies Bloc 1  party organization performs a very important role and has a very  great duty to uphold. To be worthy of this important role and  heavy responsibility, everyone must pay due attention to the  task of making the party firm and strong in all fields. It is  necessary to step up educational activities aimed at  strengthening the ideological concepts of cadres and party  members so they can firmly grasp the party organization's  policies and lines and set a good example for others to follow.  Practical plans must be worked out to help party members learn  how to improve their professional skills and intellectual  background as well as take the lead in the movement against  corruption, waste, misappropriation of public funds, bribery,  red tape, authoritarianism, and the tendency to distance oneself  from the masses.</p>

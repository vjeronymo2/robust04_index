			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Last Minute" program presented by Joao Antunes] </F>   [Text] [Words indistinct] after Washington officially  established diplomatic relations with Luanda, the (?relations)  between the two capitals [words indistinct]. What is more, the  expected opening of channels and [words indistinct] very far  from corresponding to the true expectations of the Luanda  authorities. This evening, we asked Angolan Ambassador in  Washington Jose Patricio what is the Angolan Government's  assessment of relations with Washington. Did it expect more or  did it expect less? He gave the following reply.    [Begin recording] [Patricio] In general, we expected more  both at a bilateral level and in the multilateral role played by  the United States as a mediator and as a permanent member of the  UN Security Council. All the same, we have to recognize that  there has been some progress. It could not do more because of  an impeding factor, the war.    [Antunes] You speak of an impeding factor. There is a  feeling, however, that the Luanda authorities expected the  United States to be more vigorous in condemning the National  Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA]. Is that  true?    [Patricio] We always expected the United States to adopt a  more vigorous stand with regard to UNITA's war-mongering stand.  It seems, however, that the U.S. administration has been having  difficulties in playing its rightful role in the field of  mediation and its [words indistinct] normalization of relations  at the bilateral level. All the same, recent developments show  that there will be greater transparency in Washington's role  both at bilateral and multilaterlal levels. I say this, basing  myself in the last correspondence that President Bill Clinton  had with President Jose Eduardo dos Santos. President Clinton  has abandoned the indecision of the past where the U.S.  administration viewed the government as simply one of the  parties in the conflict.    [Antunes] Mr. ambassador, (?there are reports) that  Washington is expected to play a more active role in peace talks  in Lusaka [words indistinct]?    [Patricio] Well, there is a link between all the capitals  which play the mediating role, that is Washington, Lisbon, and  Moscow. It is evident that Washington, being the capital of the  world power, has a more important role than other mediators.  Washington also has this responsibility because it was part of  the conflict since UNITA was an instrument of the U.S. policy.  We should not forget this factor. [end recording]</p>

			<p><P> December 11, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> 'DOLPHIN-SAFE' CLAIMS REMAIN CAUSE FOR DEBATE  </P> <P> The "dolphin-safe" fishing agreement that the nation's three largest tuna  canners endorsed April 12 delighted environmentalists who have, for years,  campaigned against fishing techniques that killed dolphins. Overnight, it  seemed, the nation's canners had defused a potentially explosive  public-relations fiasco.  </P> <P> But, early this month, Earth Island Institute, a San Francisco-based  environmental group, rekindled the dolphin-safe debate in full-page newspaper  advertisements that urged consumers to boycott Bumble Bee Seafoods for  allegedly canning fish caught by methods that kill and maim dolphins.  </P> <P> Executives at San Diego-based Bumble Bee promptly fought back with  advertisements that defended their products as dolphin-safe as defined by  widely accepted international guidelines. Mark Koob, Bumble Bee's president,  said it is too early to determine if the proposed boycott has hurt sales. But  Bumble Bee has urged consumers to boycott Earth Island by switching their  financial support to "responsible environmental groups."  </P> <P> So far, the dispute has been limited to Earth Island and Bumble Bee, and most  other environmental groups have stayed out of the fray. But observers say the  allegations underscore how difficult it will be for the tuna-canning industry  and the multifaceted environmental community to erect and maintain a  dolphin-safe verification system.  </P> <P> Earlier this year, Bumble Bee, H.J. Heinz Co.'s Long Beach-based StarKist  Seafoods division and San Diego-based Van Camp Seafood Co., which packages  Chicken of the Sea, began shipping tuna in cans bearing "dolphin-safe" logos.  </P> <P> But the federal government's dolphin-safe regulations won't be ready until next  year, and environmentalists haven't yet defined what role they hope to play in  the dolphin-safe labeling system. So canners have relied largely upon  internally enforced mechanisms to ensure that only dolphin-safe tuna ends up on  supermarket shelves.  </P> <P> Koob said the lack of federal regulations has allowed some individual  environmental organizations to "try to usurp" the federal government's role by  demanding their their own, more-restrictive rules be accepted.  </P> <P> Earth Island has alleged that Bumble Bee and Unicord, Bumble Bee's Thai-based  owner, have continued to accept tuna that are being caught by nets that kill  dolphins. And the environmental group alleges that the companies are failing to  document that their tuna-canning plants aren't accepting tuna caught by other  methods known to harm dolphins.  </P> <P> Koob, in recent weeks, has repeatedly said that his company's verification  records are open to "any responsible environmental groups." Unicord also has  agreed to pay for an observer selected by the environmental community who would  monitor Unicord's processing plants in Thailand.  </P> <P> If the dispute between Earth Island and Bumble Bee escalates -- or spreads to  other environmental groups and canners -- consumers "just won't know who to  believe," said Norman Dean, executive director of Washington-based Green Seal,  a nonprofit organization that is developing an "environmental seal of approval"  for deserving products.  </P> <P> Green Seal has no plans to enter the dolphin-safe debate, but Dean said any  "green" labeling that hopes to gain consumer trust would be undermined if the  industry, environmentalists and regulators fail to agree upon uniform  standards.  </P> <P> Unless agreement is reached, the fledgling dolphin-safe labeling program  "probably won't achieve its goals, and nobody will win," Dean said. "This  sounds like a case where people can get readily confused unless the issues are  clearly defined."  </P> <P> Surprisingly, relatively little disagreement remains between canners and  environmentalists who, for decades have fought bitterly over the need for  dolphin-safe fishing techniques.  </P> <P> In April, canners agreed to accept fish caught in the Eastern Tropical Pacific,  a triangular section of the Pacific Ocean bounded by San Diego, Chile and  Hawaii, only from fishing vessels that carry third-party observers who will  verify that tuna wasn't caught with giant seines that maim or kill dolphins.  </P> <P> Those nets are believed to be especially damaging to dolphin populations in the  Eastern Tropical Pacific because there, unlike anywhere else in the world,  dolphin are often found swimming directly over schools of tuna.  </P> <P> Outside of the Eastern Tropical Pacific, canners agreed that fishing fleets  should not use lengthy gill-and-drift nets to capture tuna because those  so-called "entanglement nets" often kill or maim dolphin, which are unable to  escape from schools of tuna. Canners argue that they have instituted internal  checkpoints that ensure that they accept delivery only of tuna caught through  dolphin-safe fishing techniques.  </P> <P> Koob maintained in interviews last week that Bumble Bee's dolphin-safe  guidelines are modeled after U.N. tuna-fishing guidelines. He said the  corporate rules were refined recently to accommodate concerns voiced by the  Dolphin Coalition, a Washington-based alliance that includes nearly 40  environmental groups. And Koob believes Bumble Bee's rules will be in keeping  with federal regulations scheduled to come out next year.  </P> <P> Environmentalists blame the tense situation on the fact that both canners and  environmentalists are in "an awkward situation" because federal tuna-fishing  regulations won't be in place until mid-1991. And, most environmental groups  have yet to say how they will monitor the dolphin-safe claims made by packers.  </P> <P> The Dolphin Coalition will meet Wednesday in Washington to determine what role  it might play in the continuing effort to ensure that canners stick to their  dolphin-safe pledges.  </P> <P> Christopher Croft, director of the Dolphin Coalition, declined to comment on  what will be discussed at the upcoming meeting. However, an advance agenda  suggests that participants will try to determine criteria that must be met by  canners in order to display dolphin-safe logos. The agenda also suggests that  the Dolphin Coalition will consider the creation of its own dolphin-safe logo.  </P> <P> Croft also declined to comment on the growing controversy generated by Earth  Island, which is demanding that consumers boycott Bumble Bee and instead  purchase Chicken of the Sea and StarKist brand tuna.  </P> <P> However, in a Nov. 29 letter to Earth Island, Croft asked the San Francisco  organization to refrain from "implicitly or directly suggesting that the  Dolphin Coalition . . . is supporting the Bumble Bee protest." Croft's letter  also suggested that "it is important that the (environmental) community  evaluate the situation thoroughly . . . before forming a policy."  </P> <P> And, in a recent letter to Unicord, Croft stated that the Dolphin Coalition has  yet to reject or endorse any canners' claim to be processing dolphin-free tuna.  </P> <P> Some environmentalists are worried that Earth Island's attack on Bumble Bee  could prompt consumers to dismiss dolphin-safe labeling as an example of greedy  corporations bending the truth to bolster their market share.  </P> <P> Although most environmental groups have reserved judgment on dolphin-safe  claims made by Bumble Bee, StarKist and Chicken of the Sea, environmentalists  "don't want a cynical public to look upon dolphin-safe (labels) and not believe  them," the environmentalist said.  </P> <P> Green Seal, which was created by an environmentalist who helped to organize the  first Earth Day in 1970s, believes that any certification program designed to  gain consumer trust "will succeed or fail in the details," Dean said. "You want  a system that's stable enough that people can trust it."  </P></p>

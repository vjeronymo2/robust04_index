			<p>Language: <F P=105> Latvian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Uldis Rudaks: "Ministry of Interior Affairs </F> Establishes a Bureau for Combating Drug Addiction"]    [Text] The Ministry of Interior Affairs of the Latvian  Republic has recently established a Bureau for Combating Drug  Addiction. The newly created bureau is a police organization  with all the respective rights--to conduct operative work, to  collect information, to arrest, and to implement searches,  Bureau Chief Vilnis Kipens told DIENA today.    The state police of all countries have a special department  for dealing with drug addiction, he said. Foreign experts have  acknowledged that in Latvia, which due to its geographical  position is situated in the middle of all drug trafficking  routes, narcobusiness is developing more quickly than in other  countries. Moreover, since the chemical and pharmaceutical  industries in Latvia are highly developed, a center for the  Baltic states to combat drug addiction should be situated right  here in Riga.    "The problem of drug addiction in Latvia is not yet as  alarming as in other foreign countries; however, the bureau was  established just to keep abreast, and not to find ourselves in a  situation of `running after the train.' Usually we begin to  organize things only when the water is already flowing into our  mouths," said Kipens.    The bureau was officially opened on 22 February. Thus far it  has 31 policemen on its staff. The bureau has two  departments--one is the Riga department, consisting fully of the  former seventh section of the Riga Criminal Police (for  combating drug addiction), which will fight drug addiction in  Riga. The general department will supervise chemical and  pharmaceutical plants, the airport, and the seaport. We are  also planning regional groups, cooperation with customs officers  and national guards, with neighboring countries--Lithuania,  which consistently supplies Latvia with poppies, Kaliningrad, as  well as Ukraine and Russia, through which the drugs from the  Caucasus and the Middle East are being delivered, stated V.  Kipens.    The latest report from the Interior Affairs Ministry says  that on 10 March the bureau officers arrested three persons in a  drug den on Zentene street 14 and confiscated drugs. At a  similar spot on Maskavas street 285/2 on the same day five  persons were arrested.    V. Kipens emphasized that during a drug-induced craze, drug  addicts are capable of committing any crime. On the night of 12  March, a group of drug addicts was arrested in the center of  Riga. Besides drugs, the policemen discovered in their car a set  of tools for breaking into cars, and a hand grenade. During the  same night, one man was arrested in Riga in a state of narcotic  intoxication, with two full syringes.    The Bureau for Combating Drug Addiction appeals to the  population of Latvia to inform the bureau about anyone having  information on drug dens by calling the following numbers:  208478 or 208473.</p>

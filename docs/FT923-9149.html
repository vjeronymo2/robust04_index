			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: BT rallies on pricing hints SHARES IN BT, Britain's privatised telephone and telecommunications network, rallied at the close of trading yesterday on sudden hints that the group was about to accept the recommendations on pricing policy put forward by Oftel, the regulatory pricing body. The Oftel regulations were put forward in June, when BT was given the choice of accepting the terms or risking referral to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Oftel's proposed new terms set BT's pricing formula at the inflation rate minus 7 per cent, compared with the present inflation minus 6.25 per cent which ends in June 1993. The new rate would take over until July 1997. Acceptance of the Oftel proposals by BT would be welcomed by the stock market, which would not relish a wholesale inquiry into the telecoms sector, provoking a situation similar to that faced by British Gas. 'Any MMC inquiry would rebound badly on BT,' says Mr Chris McFadden at Smith New Court. 'The City has already discounted the cost of the new formula in the share price, so acceptance would be a positive move.' The shares finished 2 ahead at 336p. Standard weak Banking analysts were yes-terday re-examining forecasts after Standard Chartered announced a fall in half-year profits to Pounds 64m from the year ago Pounds 83m. Standard shares, which fell 11 at the start of trading, were finally 20 down at 420p after 2.3m traded. The principal disappointment came from India, where the bank has suffered heavily as a result of exposure to fraud in the Bombay stock market. Ms Alison Deuchars of Smith New Court said: 'An operation that in a good year can make Pounds 15m has so far cost Pounds 118m.' The profits setback was not far from brokerage estimates, although one analyst said the decline would have been greater if the Pounds 25m taken from a law suit was stripped out. Smith has kept its profits estimate unchanged, but is now looking for a flat dividend and believes a yield of 7 per cent, implying an underlying share price around the 380p level, would be realistic. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew has reduced its full-year prediction by Pounds 25m to Pounds 210m, although the house is said to believe that the situation in India is already in the share price. GKN reverse The effects of better interim figures than expected from GKN, the motor components and industrial services group, were blunted in the market because analysts advised taking profits or switching into other stocks. The shares jumped 17 to 412p at first after the company announced a rise in half-time profits to Pounds 65.1m, compared with market forecasts of between Pounds 50m and Pounds 56m. The advance was halted as several securities houses advised investors to take profits. At County NatWest, Mr Sandy Morris said: 'At over 400p, the yield relative is towards the bottom of its ten-year range and it no longer provides support.' At Strauss Turnbull, the recommendation was for a switch from GKN to BBA Group, although the brokerage house raised its full-year forecast for GKN by Pounds 10m to Pounds 125m. The shares ended 12 down at 383p, while BBA closed unchanged at 132p. Properties hit again Property stocks suffered another savage downgrade as UBS Phillips &amp; Drew cut its estimates across the sector and sent leading shares tumbling. UBS reduced asset value forecasts for the next 12 months by an average 9 per cent and by a further 7 per cent for the year after. UBS analyst Mr Carl Gough said: 'All the industry data shows rental values continuing to decline. With signs of GDP recovery disappearing and evidence that property yields will stay above gilts for the next two years, the outlook is depressing.' The brokerage remains a seller of Great Portland Estates, off 6 at 112p, and Land Securities, 6 cheaper at 377p, but County NatWest reaffirmed its buy stance on the latter. Last-minute nerves ahead of British Petroleum's second quarter figures, scheduled for today, prompted furious trading which left the shares 4 1/2 down at 206 1/2 p, a level believed to be close to a 20-year low when measured against the FT-Actuaries All-Share Index. Turnover was very heavy, with 23m shares traded in the UK, and the US said to be losing its enthusiasm. There is still strong belief that the oil group may halve its dividend and disclose its first-ever net loss, on a replacement cost basis. Traders were unwilling to take up positions because of the intense nervousness over the outlook for the shares this morning. If there is a hint of optimism from the BP boardroom, the shares could bounce, perhaps as a result of buying from the US, where negative perceptions are not quite as pessimistic as in the UK. However, some analysts feel there is still significant downside. The first impact is expected at 11.30am when the figures are released. A rise in half-year profits and dividend for Smith &amp; Nephew helped the shares. The company also said it expected to maintain solid growth in its healthcare division. Hoare Govett reiterated its positive stance and the stock firmed 1 1/4 to 137 3/4 p. Abbey National was one of the few bright spots as analysts took a more positive line on the stock following further consideration of Monday's trading statement. The shares rose 7 to 266p on healthy turnover of 2.4m. Yorkshire Chemicals declined 7 to 283p after a number of houses, including BZW and Goldman Sachs, cut profits forecasts. BOC slid a further 7 to 584p ahead of third quarter figures, due today. Hotel group Forte remained friendless in a sector unhinged by a wholesale downgrade by a leading securities house, said to be James Capel. Forte ended 7 lower at 142p after hefty trading of 4.7m. Market watchers discounted press reports of a tax row with the government as the reason for the day's rise in P &amp; O, attributing the performance to bear-closing and increased demand for several transport stocks. The shares gained 14 to 354p on 1.8m traded. British Airways was lifted 4 to 259p by news that July traffic rose by 15.2 per cent from the year earlier level.

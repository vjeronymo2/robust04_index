			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / Northern Yemenis announce ceasefire Northern Yemenis said yesterday they would begin an indefinite ceasefire at midnight last night in the six-week war with the south. Mr Mohammed Salem Basendwa, the foreign minister, said in Sanaa: 'We have informed the secretary-general of the UN and the secretary-general of the Arab League that a ceasefire will start from midnight tonight (2100 GMT). 'The ceasefire will last until the other side ceases to abide by it. Then I don't think it will be possible for us to stop our people.' The minister said Sanaa made the ceasefire offer before Gulf Arab states made a statement on Sunday in which they said they would push for action against any side which failed to heed a UN ceasefire call made last Wednesday. 'We think the statement (by the Gulf Arab states will encourage the mutineers (southerners),' Mr Basendwa said. Southern Yemenis, who welcomed last week's ceasefire call, have said that their fighting since then has been in self-defence. Earlier yesterday, north Yemeni artillery had continued to pound Aden in the most determined offensive against the south Yemeni capital since the start of the civil war. With Aden's refinery still ablaze following an air raid on Sunday, the north's artillery turned its attention to the airport, long the mainstay of south Yemen's defence. Despite the new offensive, the airport remained fully operational. North Yemeni military forces began their latest attack on Sunday morning, as two warplanes bombed the oil refinery at Little Aden and set fire to two storage tanks. Southern political leaders said a second attack was launched in the evening, setting four more tanks alight. Mr Mohammed Hussein Hajj, manager of the refinery, said six firefighters had been killed in the blaze and a further 16 injured. He confirmed six storage tanks had been severely damaged and petrol supplies might become critical. Northern officials, in a broadcast on Sanaa Radio, denied their warplanes had been involved. Northern artillery, aiming at Aden airport, continued to shell the city yesterday. Western observers, visiting the front lines yesterday, confirmed that southern defences remained in the positions they have held for the past three days. Despite claims by Sanaa Radio of a successful attack, Aden airport was operational yesterday with southern jets flying sorties at 10-minute intervals throughout the day. According to Sanaa television, the south's aircraft yesterday attacked economic and oil installations in Marib and Shabwa provinces. The south had threatened such raids if its refinery were attacked.</p>

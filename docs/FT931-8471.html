			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / The Clinton Economic Plan: A speech to have them rocking in the aisles - Presidential rhetoric and flair attract wide support and leave the Republicans floundering RONALD REAGAN did not like it, Ross Perot thought is was 'excellent' but a little short on detail, Jack Kemp, sitting in the middle, loved its 'rhetoric and goals' but was sure it would not work and Paul Tsongas happily confessed that 'the person giving it is not the man I campaigned against'. Some of Washington's most conspicuous pundits, ever grudging in their praise, conceded it served a purpose. According to two overnight polls, three quarters of those surveyed approved its proposals, six out of ten 'enthusiastically'. One local TV station, camped in an old people's home, reported universal admiration and a willingness to contribute. A Washington Post editorial judged it 'well balanced and sturdy'. The joint session of Congress and assorted dignitaries - with Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, accorded the singular seat of honour between Mrs Hillary Rodham Clinton and Mrs Tipper Gore - interrupted it with applause no fewer than 75 times, probably a modern record. The fact that it featured the first Democrat to give a State of the Union address in 13 years is only partial explanation. It is hard to recall Mr Bill Clinton writing or delivering a better speech. He looked presidential, spoke well and pulled off the formidable trick of simultaneously engaging his audiences in Congress and watching on television. There were several high spots, starting with the rhetorical call to arms. 'If we do not act now,' he proclaimed, 'you will not recognise this country ten years from now.' And again: 'The test of our programme cannot simply be; what's in it for me? The question must be: what's in it for us?' This probably explained why Mr Reagan, writing in the New York Times in advance of the speech, dismissed it as a repeat of 'the failed liberal policies of the past'. Mr Clinton also cleverly engaged the Republican party, first by declining to blame it for anything and second by challenging it to improve his proposals. 'I did not seek this office to place blame. I come here to accept responsibility. and I want you to accept responsibility with me. If we do right by this country, I do not care who gets the credit for it.' Anticipating the predictable 'tax and spend' Republican riposte delivered later by Congressman Bob Michel, the House minority leader, the president had them rocking in the aisles when he declared 'all those who say we should cut more should be as specific as I have been'. When Republicans guffawed at his assertion that the Congressional Budget Office figures were 'independent', Mr Clinton was ready: 'Well, you can laugh, my fellow Republicans, but I'll point out that the CBO was normally more conservative in what was going to happen and closer to right than previous presi-dents have been.' The aisles rocked again. The Republicans, therefore, have been served notice to come up with some alternatives; no easy process for a party deeply riven by its own ideological battles. Pretty much all Mr Michel could say, apart from defending the economic policies of Mr Reagan and Mr George Bush, was that his party would be listening to the voices of the people. But Mr Perot, who can reasonably lay claim to have his finger on the nation's pulse and who was personally briefed in advance by Mr Clinton, said: 'I expect the American people will react very favourably' and would not object to paying higher taxes if they were fair. The president could have expected no more for the moment. Mr Perot's only aphoristic admonition was to Congress, which also suits the president well. Noting that 'the president does not pass laws,' Mr Perot said that 'giving Congress money is like giving your friend who is trying to stop drinking a liquor store'. A lot of the drinking in Washington is, of course, done by lobbyists, whom Mr Clinton duly threatened by calling for a bill ending lobbying tax deductions and enforcing stricter registration. Undeterred, however, some were quick to throw down their own gauntlets, with their congressional allies voicing support. Thus both Mr John Sturdivant, represent-ing government workers, and Congress-man Steny Hoyer, the Democrat from Maryland who heads the subcommittee handling the federal workforce, said Mr Clinton's proposal to freeze federal pay was 'unacceptable' and would be dropped. But such storm clouds could not take much away from Mr Clinton on a night when he was firing on all cylinders. Last night, far removed from the grandeur of the chamber of the House, he was bedding down in the extreme modesty of the Comfort Inn in Chillicothe, Ohio, which will not have a presidential suite and where rooms normally go for around Dollars 30 (Pounds 21) a night. This symbolism is just as important.</p>

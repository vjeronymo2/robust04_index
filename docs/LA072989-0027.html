			<p><P> July 29, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP BEAT: PIXIES AT THE PALACE: NO LEAP INTO GREATNESS  </P> <P> If the Pixies' music were a movie, it would be scripted by William Burroughs  and directed by David Lynch, with a score by the Velvet Underground. (Still  photographer: Robert Mapplethorpe.)  </P> <P> As rock 'n' roll, the Boston foursome's ongoing encounter with obsession, dread  and the struggle of the flesh and the spirit yields an unruly, intriguing clash  of harsh minimalism and soaring escape.  </P> <P> For a band with so many identifiable antecedents, the Pixies do a remarkable  job of forging an original vision, and their blend of experimentation and  accessibility has brought the group to the forefront of the alternative market.  But at the Palace on Thursday, the Pixies didn't take the leap into greatness  that seems in their range.  </P> <P> There was nothing slick or compromised about the no-nonsense, no-frills,  down-to-business performance, but the Pixies threw out the personality with the  pandering. Remote and reticent, they acted as if contact with the audience or  flamboyance on stage would somehow cheapen the act. Or maybe they're just shy.  </P> <P> Instead of enlarging on their music, they chose to distill and concentrate it  into a thick, hard attack. The taut but free-swinging sound repeatedly gained  and lost momentum, and the set was more monochromatic than the current  "Doolittle" album, which boasts an amazing scope.  </P> <P> Singer Black Francis likes to create deranged characters with his assortment of  growls, whispers, pants and shrieks, which can get labored and self-conscious.  Solution: more leads from bassist Kim Deal, whose vocal on the cult hit  "Gigantic" (winningly pronounced gi-gayan-tic and riding a "Sweet Jane"-like  riff) was one of the show's high points.

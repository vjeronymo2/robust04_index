			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Power stocks weak Power generation stocks were among the market's worst performers with utilities specialists saying that all the utilities sectors, which attract support because of their high yields and quality of earnings, may suffer in the absence of any UK interest rate reductions in the short term. The generators were the worst affected, with UBS, the Swiss-owned stockbroking firm, said to have been an aggressive seller. There were also suggestions that PowerGen and National Power could be about to sell some power stations, to try to head off a referal to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Just before Christmas, Offer, the electricity watchdog, said the English generators could avoid an MMC referral if they came up with an acceptable pricing regime and sold some of their power stations. The Scottish generators were heavily sold, Scottish Power sliding 13, or 2.9 per cent, to 441p, on heavy turnover of 5.2m shares. Hydro dipped 11, or 2.5 per cent to 436p. National Power fell 11, or 2.3 per cent, to 467p and PowerGen 9 to 535p.</p>

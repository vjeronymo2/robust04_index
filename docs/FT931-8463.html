			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / The Clinton Economic Plan: Shift in debt maturities - Bonds PRESIDENT Clinton's deficit-cutting plan may include a reduction in the maturities of debt issues by the US Treasury, in an attempt to reduce heavy interest costs. Mr Leon Panetta, budget director, has projected Dollars 11.5bn in savings over four years by shifting debt maturities. Savings are possible because short-term interest rates in the US are substantially lower than long-term rates. The benchmark 30-year long bond yields 7.04 per cent, compared to the bond-equivalent yield of 2.94 per cent on three-month Treasury bill. The wide margin reflects last year's short-term interest rate cuts and fears about the future impact of the budget deficit and inflation. Mr Panetta tried to reassure the markets on Wednesday night by saying any change in the debt mix would be made gradually. Analysts, however, say a shift in debt to the short end of the yield curve could be short-sighted, and would expose the huge US debt to increased reinvestment risk. 'The Dollars 11.5bn savings would come only if all things remain constant, and nothing does,' said Mr Frank Sannella, credit market analyst at Stone and McCarthy Research Services. The Treasury runs the risk of missing out on relatively cheap long-term rates while driving up the cost of short-term debt. 'With interest rates as low as they are, its time to lock in on the long end, which is what many corporations are doing right now,' said Mr Daniel Smith, president-elect of the American Bankers Association.</p>

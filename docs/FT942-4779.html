			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / Arts: Small screen pioneer - Obituary / Dennis Potter Dennis Potter, the greatest British dramatist of his generation, and perhaps the best television writer that the world has yet seen, died yesterday from cancer. He was 59. He will be remembered best for his television serials Pennies From Heaven and, above all, The Singing Detective. In these he used the popular songs of the 1930s, '40s and '50s to recapture the spirit of an age and, more significantly, as a route into the internal landscape of the mind. This area, previously the territory of writers such as Proust and Joyce and painters such as Bosch and Magritte, was explored by Potter in the course of a prolific television career which began with The Confidence Course in 1965 and has not yet ended. Told that the cancer would kill him, he set out some months ago in a race against death to complete Karaoke and Cold Lazarus, two new serials, one about cryogenics and the other about virtual reality. At his request a unique arrangement has been made for one to be originated next year on the BBC with repeats on Channel 4 and the other to be originated by Channel 4 with repeats on the BBC. Born in the Forest of Dean, the son of a miner, Potter went to Oxford as a scholarship boy. Later in life he said of his university career 'You know what you gain easily enough - exams, Oxford, the chance to walk around with Dostoevsky under your arm - but it takes longer to find out what you've lost'. The recording of what had been lost dominated Potter's work, much of which was autobiographical (more so than he wanted to admit) and deeply English. There were the personal losses of a man born into a family of working class Christians who embraced the Labour politics of the Attlee era; and the national losses of someone whose generation had seen the end of the British Empire, the horrors of the second world war, and the spread of Coca Cola imperialism which both fascinated and horrified Potter. From Oxford he joined the BBC as a general trainee, but he fell out very soon over his writing for the left wing New Statesman and departed the BBC to join the Labour newspaper, the Daily Herald. In 1965 he wrote his first four television dramas, the last two inspired by his experiences as a working class graduate attempting to become a Labour MP, the Nigel Barton plays. In the following six years more than a dozen of his dramas were screened, most, though not all, by the BBC. They included Where The Buffalo Roam, Son Of Man and Angels Are So Few, and were concerned with man as a spiritual, sexual and political being - usually in that order. In 1971 came the incurable disease, psoriatic arthropathy, affecting the joints and the skin, which forced Potter more than ever to rely upon his inner resources. On the rare occasions when he appeared in public one of his contorted fists invariably contained a smoking cigarette. His work, which had always created controversy now began to cause major national rows. In Brimstone And Treacle one of Potter's favourite figures, the in-coming stranger, turns out to be the devil incarnate who figuratively rapes the family's middle class sensibilities and literally rapes the mentally damaged daughter. BBC director-general Alasdair Milne banned it and it took 11 years to reach the screen. What with that and other works which asked agonised and agonising questions about the spiritual underpinnings of Christianity, and the sexual explicitness of dramas such as Casanova, Potter became the bete noir of the 'Clean Up TV' people. It was a classic confrontation between the individualistic artist, driven to open up and examine what it means to be human and to communicate the answers as vividly as possible, and the group of fearful onlookers in which the instinct is to collude and suppress, to muffle and gag the frightening evidence offered by the non-conformist. Potter won the battle in glorious fashion by producing work such as Pennies From Heaven and The Singing Detective which, while still profoundly concerned with the condition of humanity, was also among the most entertaining drama ever seen on television. However good Karaoke and Cold Lazarus may be, The Singing Detective from 1986 will always be seen as a - arguably the - chief milestone in the first 50 years of the development of television drama. An engrossingly complex through-composition on several levels of consciousness, it speaks of childhood and family roots, love and loss of innocence in a a deeply moving way. Yet it is, too, wonderfully funny. Dennis Potter's wife, Margaret, died only last week. He leaves a son and two daughters.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One approach to reducing some of the uncertainties is to critically define and examine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the assumptions made in the risk assessment process. Several of the more generic of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assumptions are listed in Table 5&hyph;1. Despite their diversity, these assumptions share the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attribute of being partially replaceable by factual information. If, for example, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assumption of 100 percent absorption of a toxicant from a contaminated food source is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> replaced by data demonstrating that 90 percent of the toxicant is not biologically available  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under human exposure conditions, then a revised risk assessment could allow a 10-fold  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> greater exposure from that source; i.e., the former risk assessment was too conservative by a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> factor of 10. As another example, many risk assessments employ data from two species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If experimental animals and humans absorb or metabolize the same fraction of a dose,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the potency estimate would not change when extrapolating from animals to humans.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, it is necessary to have information on both human and animal rates before  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changes in potency estimates are made. If a toxicant acts via a reactive intermediate and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> humans produce 10-fold more of the intermediate than either of the test species under similar  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditions, then allowable human exposure should be decreased 10-fold (i.e., the allowable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exposure levels are 10-fold too high) or an increased danger to human health exists. These  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> findings could then replace the ``most sensitive species'' principle with facts concerning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relevant human exposure and susceptibility. In these examples, the identification of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assumption helps define research needs or knowledge gaps (Sheehan et al., 1989).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In general, the knowledge gaps are many and complex, but some can be filled with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> practical solutions. The combination of ample dose-response data and a quantitative risk  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessment process can eliminate assumptions 1 (existence of a threshold) and 2  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (reasonableness of safety factors) of the six generic assumptions (Table 5&hyph;1). The uncertainty  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of assumption 4 (exposure comparisons) could be at least reduced with the proper application  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of appropriate pharmacokinetic data. Likewise, the uncertainty of generic assumption 3  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (variability of heterogeneous populations) can theoretically be reduced with the use of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> biomarkers of exposure and biomarkers of effect, to more accurately define the relationship  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> between exposure and biological effect in a large population.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many assumptions remain, however, and uncertainty reduction by filling knowledge  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gaps will ultimately require greater understanding of biological mechanisms underlying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> neurotoxicity. A single risk assessment model may not be adequate for all conditions of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exposure, for all endpoints, or for all agents. Risk assessment models of the future may well  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include biomarkers of both effect and exposure as well as biologically based mechanistic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considerations derived from both epidemiologic and experimental test system data.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

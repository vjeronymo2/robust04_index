			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters were concerned that the procedure of obtaining NPDES permits from State agencies and EPA for treatment and disposal of test water could significantly delay testing. This potential for delay probably would be limited to areas where operators do not transport test water to refineries for treatment and discharge, or do not store it for use in subsequent tests. Although none of the commenters estimated the time that would be needed to secure the NPDES permits, RSPA has considered this potential for delay in setting deadlines for compliance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two operators and API suggested that RSPA somehow help the industry in obtaining from EPA a general NPDES permit for the disposal of treated test water. They also requested our assistance in obtaining a general waiver of the EPA requirement to measure the toxicity of test water. API said these actions would provide flexibility for efficient scheduling and implementation of testing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA has procedures for issuing permits and waivers under its NPDES program. EPA's decisions on applications for permits and waivers depend on facts known to the industry. Under these circumstances, RSPA believes an operator is the appropriate party to apply for permits or waivers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To hasten the process, RSPA will notify EPA of this final rule. RSPA will urge that agency to give prompt attention to requests for NPDES permits involving disposal of test water used to comply with the final rule. RSPA will also ask EPA to request its cooperating State agencies to give prompt attention to requests for permits and waivers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Smart Pig Alternative <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several operators and API recommended that the final rule allow the use of smart pigs (internal inspection devices) as an alternative to pressure testing for all pipelines, except the pre-1970 ERW pipelines. Two of these operators said pigging is superior to pressure testing because it shows where potential problems lie. Two operators thought pigging is better at finding corrosion problems, particularly deep isolated pits that may survive a pressure test. One operator and API argued that smart pigs could alleviate potential disruptions of service and many environmental and scheduling problems. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Despite the capabilities of smart pigs, RSPA knows of no evidence that they can provide satisfactory long-term protection against the growth of defects. Only a minimum 25 percent proven margin of safety between MOP and a previous test or operating pressure is generally recognized as able to provide this protection. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Various manufacturers have significantly improved the data collection and recording capabilities of smart pigs. The ability of trained personnel to interpret recorded pig data has also improved. Yet smart pigs still cannot detect as many pipeline defects that could grow to failure during operation as can an adequate pressure test. Longitudinal defects, like cracks in a longitudinal weld seam, are particularly resistant to detection by smart pigs. More important, an adequate pressure test provides a basis for safe operation, with a proven margin of safety against the growth of defects that survive the test. Smart pigs cannot provide such a margin of safety. Thus, they are not an adequate substitute for pressure testing in achieving the objectives of this rulemaking proceeding. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Carbon Dioxide Pipelines <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two operators argued that RSPA should not adopt the proposed rules for older carbon dioxide pipelines, particularly production field distribution lines. They offered various reasons to exempt carbon dioxide pipelines: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Carbon dioxide is non-polluting. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The pipelines are relatively new, having been constructed in the 1980s. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The pipelines have been pressure tested hydrostatically, but perhaps not to part 195 standards. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The failure data used as a basis for the proposed rules did not include carbon dioxide pipelines. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;After hydrostatic pressure testing, carbon dioxide pipelines must be dehydrated, an expensive process that is not applicable to hazardous liquid pipelines. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

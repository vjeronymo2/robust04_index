			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / LDP faces defeat as coalition is formed JAPAN'S Liberal Democratic party is on the verge of losing power after seven opposition parties yesterday agreed to support a joint prime ministerial candidate and form a coalition government. Two parties holding the balance of power, the Japan New party and the New Harbinger party, said yesterday they had no intention of backing the LDP, which needs their votes during a parliamentary session to appoint a new prime minister next week. If the seven opposition parties do not falter in the next few days, the LDP will lose office for the first time since 1955, though the new coalition is comprised mostly of conservative parties unlikely to want sudden changes in economic and foreign policy. The ideological exception in the seven is the Social Democratic party, formerly the Japan Socialist party, which wants the disbanding of the Japanese military, takes a tougher foreign policy line against the US, and supports totalitarian North Korea in preference to South Korea. But the seven parties have been able to form a coalition by agreeing not to talk about the SDP's more controversial policies and concentrating their discussion on overhauling the scandal-tainted political system and toppling the LDP, which is continuing to lose members. Three MPs left yesterday and further resignations are likely in the next week, with most defectors planning to join the Japan Renewal party, run by Mr Tsutomu Hata, the former LDP faction head who brought down the government of Mr Kiichi Miyazawa and forced a general election on July 18. Apart from the JRP, the SDP, the JNP, and NHP, the coalition includes the Komeito, backed by the a Buddhist movement, the Democratic Socialist party, and the United Social Democratic party. The seven parties concede that their planned partnership could be short-lived and that another general election is possible within a few months. Two candidates formally applied yesterday to replace Mr Miyazawa in the LDP presidency, to be decided at a party meeting tomorrow. Mr Michio Watanabe, 70, the former foreign minister, is competing, although he is in poor health, while Mr Yohei Kono, the chief cabinet secretary, was asked by party elders to stand. Mr Kono, 56, hopes that his candidacy will tempt one of the coalition members to join the LDP in government. His claims to being a reformer are based on his own defection from the LDP in the 1970s to form a breakaway group, which was later reunited with the party. In the past, selection as LDP president has also carried the title of prime minister, but the successful candidate must face a challenge in parliament next week from the coalition's candidate for the leadership. The LDP is certain of receiving 224 votes, while a stable coalition can count on 245 votes. It is still unclear who will represent the coalition, though Mr Hata is favourite, followed by Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the JNP leader. Both rate well in public opinion polls and other coalition parties have indicated that either will be acceptable. If the coalition does crumble in the next few days, the most likely causes would be a split in the SDP or successful overtures by the LDP to one coalition member. However, the likelihood of a coalition government has increased following the rejection of the LDP's vague political reform proposals by the JNP and NHP.</p>

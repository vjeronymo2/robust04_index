			<p><P> July 19, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> RESEDA COUPLE SUES BABY-SITTER CHARGED WITH MURDERING THEIR SON  </P> <P> A Reseda couple whose 9-month-old son died while in the care of a baby-sitter  who is now charged with his murder filed a Superior Court lawsuit Wednesday  seeking unspecified monetary damages.  </P> <P> The wrongful death lawsuit, filed in Van Nuys Superior Court by Kevin Young and  Toni Majoy-Young, accuses Debra Suzanne Cummings of intentionally causing the  death of their infant son, Kevin.  </P> <P> Cummings, 32, a Reseda mother and PTA president, has been charged with  first-degree murder in Kevin's death and is also under investigation in the  death of another baby who died in March while in her care. She has pleaded not  guilty to the charge.  </P> <P> Also named in the lawsuit are Cummings' husband, Michael, and Gladys L.  Goodall, the owner of the home the Cummings rented, who are accused of  negligence in Kevin's death, said Dennis M. Walsh, the Youngs' attorney. Debra  Cummings is also accused of negligence in the lawsuit.  </P> <P> Cummings could not be reached for comment. Her attorney, Joe Ingber, did not  return a reporter's telephone call.  </P> <P> Young, whom Cummings had cared for almost daily for six months, died on June 16  of skull fractures suffered in Cummings' home the previous day. Cummings told  police that the baby fell against a coffee table, but a coroner's report said  the baby appeared to have been hit with a hand or fist.  </P> <P> Cummings, president of the PTA at Shirley Avenue Elementary School in Reseda,  is under investigation in connection with the March 15 death of a 14-month-old  baby. Matthew Cooley, of Reseda, lost consciousness while at a park with  Cummings. His doctor listed the cause of death as an apparent seizure, but the  boy's mother told police that she became suspicious because the boy had  experienced seizures only with Cummings.  </P></p>

			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Irish political football becomes a hot potato - The chief executive of Aer Lingus may not be the only head to roll MR CATHAL Mullan, who until Tuesday night was the chief executive of Aer Lingus, the Irish state airline, must be pondering the irony of his fate. He was due to chair a conference next month entitled 'The Management Paradox - Survival, Growth and Jobs' organised by the Irish Management Institute. His own job has now gone, 600 others in the company will go shortly, and big asset sales are in the pipeline as the group struggles for survival, with trading losses running at IPounds 40m a year. Losses will be compounded this year by IPounds 50m in extraordinary items - IPounds 20m in redundancy costs and an IPounds 30m write-down on its shareholding in GPA, the aviation leasing group. Mr Mullan resigned following the announcement on Tuesday that Mr Bernie Cahill, who was appointed group chairman in August 1991, has been appointed by the government as executive chairman and been instructed by the minister of transport to 'take whatever action necessary to restore the company to commercial viability'. Transport minister Brian Cowan indicated that such actions will include a revision of air fares, the sale of non-core assets and across-the-board cost reductions, which will involve the shedding of some 600 jobs out of a worldwide workforce of 13,000. Mr Mullan's head may not be the only one to eventually roll out of the boardroom. But at the moment, the move to appoint Mr Cahill as the executioner has the opposition crying 'scapegoat'. Mr Michael Noonan, the transport spokesman for the opposition Fine Gael party, said: 'It appears to have been a forced resignation. I would like to see the minister making a fuller statement as to why Mr Cahill did not appear to act as chairman for the past 18 months, and yet is now being asked to act in a very short period of time . . . There seems to be a deliberate attempt by the government to distance themselves from what is a very hot political potato.' Aer Lingus has been facing financial difficulties for several years - a result of a too-rapid expansion of its fleet during the late 1980s, coinciding with a downturn in air traffic triggered by the Gulf war and the recessions in the US and UK. This has caused interest charges to soar, while fare competition on its main routes has become intense. Remedial action has not been taken sooner, however, due to a policy, pursued by successive governments, that Aer Lingus should not simply be a national air carrier, but should also be a tool of regional development policy within Ireland. For instance all transatlantic flights, including those of other airlines into and out of Ireland, are obliged to make a stop-over at Shannon in the west of the country. The company has argued strongly that this has put it at a disadvantage with cheaper routes out of London. It also operates a number of domestic routes which other carriers have pulled out of due to their lack of profitability. The airline carried 4.3m passengers last year on 43 routes in 11 countries. Forty per cent of them were on the busy, but intensely competitive Dublin-London route, while 400,000 travelled on transatlantic flights. Average revenue per passenger kilometre was 9.2p in 1992, although for the transatlantic routes this fell to 4.1p last year, while for the European routes it was 13.4p. A company spokesman said yesterday: 'Few of our routes could be described as profitable at the moment.' The government, however, wants to keep the present route structure, and particularly the transatlantic ones, as intact as possible, preferring to keep the core airline business up and running, while disposing of profitable subsidiaries. Most likely to come under the auctioneer's hammer is the group's chain of 14 hotels in the UK, which forms the Copthorne Hotel group, although in the present economic climate in the UK, it is unlikely to get a good price for them. Other possibilities include Team Aer Lingus, the six-hangar aircraft maintenance facility in Dublin, although such a move would most likely face stiff political opposition. The Labour party, one of the partners in the coalition government, did extraordinarily well in the last general election in the north Dublin area, largely on the back of promises made to Aer Lingus workers that government capital would be pumped into the airline to secure its survival. In a country of already high unemployment, jobs has become a watch-word for votes, and Aer Lingus has for years been the quintessential political football. Unfortunately for Mr Mullan, who has served 36 years with the group, now that the cost of that policy is no longer sustainable, he has been the first to pay the price. It will be interesting to see which other heads roll as Mr Cahill's axe falls.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                AER LINGUS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                   Financial Year (Figures in IPounds m)                           86-87   87-88   88-89   89-90   90-91   91-92  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Air transport division    operating profit/loss  (2.3)     5.2    2.8    (9.3)  (19.6)   (8.8) Group pre-tax profit/loss 19.5     36.5   40.1    39.1     6.6    (3.1)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Aer Lingus Group annual report 91-92  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

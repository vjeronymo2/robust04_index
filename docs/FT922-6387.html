			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / ITV will ask court to bar soccer deal THE ITV ASSOCIATION said last night it planned to seek an injunction to block completion by the Premier League of a football deal with British Sky Broadcasting and the BBC worth Pounds 304m over five years. Mr Greg Dyke, chairman of the association that represents all ITV companies, said after consulting Mr Christopher Carr QC that the injunction would be sought on Tuesday. The aim will be to prevent Premier League clubs from completing a contract without giving ITV the chance to respond to BSkyB's last-minute improved offer to a meeting of league chairman last Monday. ITV is seeking the injunction on the grounds of breach of confidence. It alleges that details of its final offer were disclosed to BSkyB, enabling the satellite consortium to make an improved offer. Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a stake in BSkyB in which Mr Rupert Murdoch's News International has the biggest holding. The final ITV offer was worth Pounds 262m including overseas rights and sponsorship over five years. Mr Dyke declined to say at a press conference whether individuals would be named in the application for an injunction. Mr Alan Sugar, chairman of Tottenham Hotspur and of Amstrad, the consumer electronics company, said yesterday he had called BSkyB with details of the ITV deal. He added: 'They had already been informed of ITV's final offer.' Mr Dyke said yesterday that Mr Rick Parry, chief executive of the Premier League, had been named in newspaper reports as a person who had called BSkyB. Mr Dyke called on Mr Parry to confirm or deny this. He also said he had asked to meet Sir Gordon Borrie, director-general of fair trading, about the deal. He said that on May 15 Mr Parry had said that Mr Murdoch, chief executive of News Corporation, had promised the full support of his five national newspapers for the league. That promise had been repeated to the league chairmen and may have influenced the way some voted, Mr Dyke alleged. 'We would like the whole matter to be opened up to informed debate,' he added. Mr Andrew Knight, News International chairman, said last night that normal editorial judgment would prevail in coverage of the league. Sir John Quinton, chairman of the Premier League and of Barclays Bank, yesterday rejected ITV complaints of unfair treatment. The league had 'formally accepted' the offer from BSkyB and the BBC, and he hoped there would no further debate. Mr Marmaduke Hussey, BBC chairman, was asked at a press conference yesterday whether he had discussed the football deal with Mr Murdoch. He said that was not the sort of question he answered. When the question was put again the press conference was brought to an end. Not a level playing field, Page 6</p>

			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] The deputy director of the Gallup  Institute in Hungary, Gyorgy Fischer, said in an interview in  the 14 December Budapest weekly 168 ORA that according to  Gallup's public opinion research data the liberal Federation of  Young Democrats (Fidesz) will win the May parliamentary  election. Moreover, if the election were held now, Fischer  said, the four liberal parties in the field taken together would  "have a decisive lead." Asked why Gallup's forecasts "depart"  from those of other well-known polling organizations in Hungary,  like Szonda Ipsos--which reported recently that the former  reform communists' Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP) has "caught  up" with Fidesz and that "the public sees greater chances for an  MSZP victory than a Fidesz victory" (NEPSZABDSAG, 13  December)--Fischer said that the "seeming differences" result  from the fact that other polling organizations "interpret their  data differently." If the elections were held now, according to  the Gallup data accompanying the interview, of those who have  chosen a party, 29 percent would vote for Fidesz and 22 percent  for the MSZP. The other parties would get the following  percentages: the currently ruling Hungarian Democratic Forum,  10; the Christian Democratic People's Party, 9; the liberal  Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ), 9; the Independent  Smallholders Party, 6; and other parties, a total of 15.    Fischer did not dispute the finding of Szonda Ipsos and  other  polling agencies that the MSZP has become considerably more  popular since last year and that Fidesz has lost popularity. He  maintained, however, that the MSZP has reached its limit while  the liberal parties have reserves of potential support. "The  MSZP's ascendance has stopped" in the past four months, he  argued, "and in fact, we can see a 2-3 percent decrease" in its  vote-getting ability. Thus, although Gallup data show the MSZP  running neck and neck with Fidesz, each with 24 percent of those  who consider themselves "certain voters," Fischer declared that  the data do not support predictions "of a landslide victory of  the left" in the next election. "The MSZP has no place to grow,"  Fischer asserted, "because it has already won over everyone who  was a potential supporter. It seems to have come up against a  brick wall that it is not likely to break through." In contrast,  Fischer said, "many" people cite Fidesz and its main liberal  partner, SZDSZ, as their second choice. "It is important that  few people consider the liberal parties to be ones that they  would not vote for under any circumstances."    A table included with the interview compares the accuracy of  the 1990 election predictions made by three prominent polling  organizations: Gallup, Median, and the Hungarian Public Opinion  Research Institute. (A footnote indicates that the government  disbanded the latter in 1990 and that "most of its leading  workers now work in the leadership of Szonda Ipsos.") According  to the table, Gallup came closest to calling the election,  coming within 1.7 percent of the overall result and not erring  by more than 2.0 percent in its prediction for any individual  party. The overall error rate of the Hungarian Public Opinion  Research Institute was 2.2 percent and of Median 2.8 percent.</p>

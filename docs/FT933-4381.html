			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Holiday price war set for ceasefire: Travel agents say profits have fallen too far THE SHORT-LIVED holiday price war will end on Saturday when the two largest travel agents' chains are expected to terminate their offer of a 10 per cent discount on all bookings. Thomas Cook, which sparked the price war just over three weeks ago, ended its 10 per cent offer last Saturday. Lunn Poly, the largest travel retail chain, says that it will end the discount this weekend, although it will continue to offer some reductions. The second-biggest retail group, made up of Pickfords Travel and Hogg Robinson, says that it is also likely to call off the 10 per cent campaign. The chains say that although the discounts on summer 1994 holidays have resulted in the highest-ever level of early bookings, the 10 per cent reduction deprived them of almost all their profits. 'We were effectively giving away the standard retailer's margin,' one travel agent said. The decision by the travel retailers to end hostilities comes in a week in which companies in several sectors have attempted to gain an edge on competitors by cutting prices. The Times newspaper this week reduced its price from 45p to 30p; Mercury, the telecommunications company, offered free evening and weekend local calls in the London area on its new cellular network; and Save &amp; Prosper, the investment group, launched a Visa card with an interest rate at least 7 percentage points lower than most rivals. The decision by the travel retailers to call off their discounting campaign indicates that, in the holiday industry at least, there are limits to how long steep price reductions can be maintained without damaging business. Travel agents usually demand a 10 per cent commission from tour operators, but some small operators say they have been asked for more. Tour operators already operate on tiny margins. Civil Aviation Authority figures show that the top 30 tour operators last year had average profit margins of only 2.8 per cent. This is still far better than the late 1980s, when price competition was at its most intense. In 1987, the top 30 operators had an average margin of minus 0.9 per cent. In 1988 the average profit margin was 0.5 per cent; in 1989 it was zero. Few in the industry want to return to damaging competition. All the large retailers are now part of integrated travel groups which, while striving to increase market share, do not want to endanger their profitability. Lunn Poly is part of the Thomson group, Pickfords and Hogg Robinson are owned by Airtours, and Thomas Cook has financial links with Owners Abroad.</p>

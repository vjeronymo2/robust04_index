			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Danes feel ERM strain THE DANISH central bank sent a flutter through European exchange markets yesterday by raising its two-week repo rate by 1.2 percentage points to defend the krone, writes Stephanie Flanders. The Danes' action came before the news that the Bundesbank and Bank of France were leaving their official interest rates unchanged. The rate increase left Danish real interest rates at 8 per cent on the day that Danish GDP was announced to have fallen by 1.6 per cent in the first quarter of the year. The combined effect was to heighten speculation that the Danish currency was in trouble, while the tension surrounding the French franc subsided. Traders reported interventions by the Danish and Dutch authorities throughout the day, as the krone fluctuated widely. There was a flurry of rumours, thought to have begun in the New York market, that the Danish government was making plans to leave the ERM. But few analysts took them seriously. 'I give them two out of ten for credibility,' said Ms Alison Cottrell at Midland Global Markets in London. Some thought that the active rumour market was itself a sign that the speculators had lost their nerve. Perhaps supporting this view, the Danish currency was able to finish slightly above Wednesday's European close of DKr3.8951 per D-Mark, at DKr3.8925. Meanwhile, the pressure on the French franc eased a little, with the currency hovering between FFr3.41 and FFr3.42 for most of the day. Analysts continue to differ on the long term prospects for the franc fort policy. Mr Brian Hilliard, international economist at Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull in London, said that ultimately the existing parities would survive. 'What is happpening is a scare, not a fatal blow,' he commented. 'The fact that the Bundesbank did not reduce rates yesterday morning led many people to write off further German moves to help the franc,' he added. 'But there is plenty more that they can do to help the French. The Bundesbank's commitment to support the franc is total.' On the other side of the spectrum was Mr Neil MacKinnon of Citibank in London: 'The absence of a Bundesbank rate move puts another nail in the coffin of the ERM.' Gaining, as ever, from the uncertainty in continental Europe was the dollar, which rose against the D-Mark for most of the day. The US currency ended at DM1.7245 in London, up from Wednesday's DM1.7155. In New York, however, it eased back to a DM1.7207 close. 'The dollar can only gain as long as the European turmoil continues,' said one London trader. The pound suffered against the D-Mark, but this was considered to be the result of profit-taking, rather than a re-evaluation of sterling's underlying strength. It finished at DM2.5650, down 1 1/4 pfennigs.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The Chamber of Deputies on 9 June passed a draft  bill approving an agreement to cooperate in the prevention and  control of the laundering of money derived from the illegal  trade of drugs and narcotics. The document was signed between  the Paraguayan and U.S. Governments in November 1993.    Deputy Constantino Mencia Ayala, head of the Drug  Enforcement  Committee, argued in favor of approving the bill considering the  need for mutual cooperation to control drug traffickers'  international money laundering.    He said the agreement's purpose was to eradicate money  laundering through adequate cooperation between the two  governments, particularly considering the major increase in  mafia-linked financial operations to launder dollars obtained  through the sale of narcotics.    Deputies passed the bill by a broad margin and immediately  sent it to the executive branch for promulgation. [passage  omitted]</p>

			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Tarmac begins disposal programme with US sale TARMAC, has announced the sale for Dollars 42.5m (Pounds 22.9m) of its Californian contracting and aggregate operations, making it the latest British construction group to begin a disposal programme to reduce heavy borrowings. Mr Neville Simms, recently appointed chief executive, wants to raise between Pounds 200m and Pounds 250m from sales of non-core businesses. Earlier this week Costain, another large British construction group, announced plans to float off part of its profitable Australian coal mining subsidiary in a further move to reduce borrowings. Wimpey, the construction and engineering group which is Britain's second biggest house builder, has raised more than Pounds 300m during the past 12 months from disposals. Taylor Woodrow, another large contractor, has announced a similar programme to dispose of non-core and underperforming assets to reduce debts. At the end of last year Tarmac had net borrowings of Pounds 456.9m and gearing of 51 per cent. Mr Simms has said that he wanted to reduce gearing to 25 per cent, mainly through disposals. It is hoped that more than Pounds 100m will be raised from a first phase of sales, to include the Californian construction business and the British oil refining interests at Ellesmere Port and Dundee. A second phase of disposals will include Econowaste, the UK waste disposal business, which went on the market last week, and which Tarmac expects to fetch between Pounds 80m and Pounds 100m. Granite Construction of the US has bought the Californian businesses. The businesses were acquired by Tarmac in 1986 for about Dollars 20m. Tarmac, which is Britain's biggest house builder, also has housebuilding operations in Washington state and Maryland, which are being retained.</p>

			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Somalia's clans tire of war: A look at the prospects for a fragile peace accord Somalia's arch-rivals, Gen Mohamed Farah Aideed and Mr Ali Mahdi Mohamed, embraced yesterday in Nairobi and pledged to form a government of national reconciliation only hours before the last US troops were due to pull out of Somalia. The two warlords, promoted to 'faction leaders' by a more conciliatory United Nations, signed an agreement which commits them to implementing a ceasefire, disarming their militias, and holding a conference on May 15 to elect a president, vice-presidents and a prime minister for their war-torn country. Somalia has not had a government since Gen Mohamed Siad Barre was overthrown in January 1991 and rival clans plunged the country into civil war. Details of the new agreement were sketchy. The short declaration did not explain how power would be shared among the 15 clans and numerous sub-clans who have fought so bitterly for hegemony over the past three years. Somaliland, the former British colony which straddles the north-west of the country, has unilaterally declared independence and did not take part in the Nairobi talks. Gen Aideed and Mr Ali Mahdi have embraced before, only to resume fighting across the green line that divides Mogadishu. Two previous peace agreements have collapsed. But all sides were keen to put a positive gloss on yesterday's proceedings. Mr Ali Mahdi spoke of 'a new determination in Somalia. . . to deal with conflict peacefully and collectively'. Ambassador Lansana Kouyate of Guinea, who brokered the peace talks on behalf of the UN, said the present agreement had a greater chance of success because 'the Somali people and their leaders are tired of war'. The new climate of understanding rests on fragile ground. On Wednesday night, Mr Kouyate announced the peace talks had collapsed, after Somali factions called off their reconciliation ceremony for the third time in a week. Yesterday, he cautioned the new agreement was 'only a beginning'. Mr Kouyate leaned heavily on the factions to reach some kind of public understanding before the departure of US troops, which many feared would bring back anarchy and violence to Somalia. The agreement, however cosmetic, will buy the UN time in which to readjust its operation in Somalia in the face of its rapidly crumbling military presence there. The withdrawal of the 28,000-strong US force and all the European contingents has turned a multinational UN peacekeeping force into a Third World operation with uncertain aims. Pakistan, with the largest contingent in Somalia, is threatening to withdraw its 5,300 soldiers unless the UN provides better military hardware. 'Are the lives of Pakistanis cheaper, or is our job to be completed less effectively?' asked Mr Sardar Aseef, the foreign minister, during an inspection tour this month. The complaint masks the impotence of the peacekeepers who remain. Mogadishu airport is looking bereft without the display of heavy weaponry that marked the 15-month stay of US troops. Aid agencies say looting and banditry are on the rise. On Sunday, two Italian journalists were shot dead in Mogadishu. Seven aid workers have been kidnapped since January. But UN soldiers have avoided any action that might bring them into conflict with lawless gunmen ever since a battle in October which killed 18 US soldiers. 'A bunker mentality pervades the fortified UN compound in Mogadishu,' says Mr Richard Burge of the British charity Save the Children Fund (SCF). 'Having an international force in Somalia has only given us a false sense of security.' When an SCF warehouse came under attack from looters in Belet Wein last month, Italian peacekeepers stationed in the town failed to come to the rescue. 'They just switched off their radio,' Mr Burge said. Few aid workers believe clan leaders can regain control of their gunmen. 'Real disarmament will be a task for the new government,' Gen Aideed said yesterday. So will the creation of a police force, an independent judiciary, and all the civil institutions which Gen Aideed and other warlords so effectively destroyed. For the moment, at least, it appears Somalia's fractious clans have more to gain from talking than from fighting.</p>

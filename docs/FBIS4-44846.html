			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "The Euroflag Consortium Focusses on </F> Propellers"]    [Text] London. The European Consortium, "Future Large  Aircraft" (FLA), has now decided on turboprop propulsion for its  heavy military air transport project. British Aerospace Corp.,  the FLA program partner in London, explained that jet propulsion  had been rejected because considerable technical difficulties  were anticipated in having the jet engines attain the  short-takeoff capability required on undeveloped terrain.    A further consideration in the decision is that turboprop  aircraft are cheaper to develop and produce. Moreover, modern  turboprop aircraft can now fly just about as fast as jet  aircraft. On the basis of current calculations, the FLA aircraft  is expected to fly at a maximum cruising speed of 72 percent of  the speed of sound (Mach). The most advanced U.S. military  transport aircraft, employing jet propulsion, fly at 77 percent  the speed of sound.    Just a few months ago, it seemed certain that the FLA  aircraft would be driven by jet engines. Several European  companies had already proposed their engines for the planned  aircraft, and for some time it seemed as though the future  belonged to strictly jet propulsion.    In the second half of the 1980s, the U.S. aviation industry  dropped plans for the construction of a turboprop commercial  aircraft when the airlines decided against it on the grounds  that the flying public were too accustomed to jet aircraft. Even  the significantly lower specific fuel consumption of advanced  turboprop engines could not alter the decision.    Two European consortia are already interested in building  the  turboprop engines for the FLA aircraft. One is the  German-British BMW-Rolls Royce grouping, and the other is the  Snecma (France), Fiat (Italy), and MTU (Germany) group.    Ratier-Figeac and Hispano Suiza of France and Dowty of Great  Britain are interested in developing and producing the  propellers. The main competitors of the planned FLA  aircraft--the new An-70 from Ukraine and the Lockheed C130J from  the United States--are likewise driven by turboprop engines.</p>

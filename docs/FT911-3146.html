			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / World Trade News: Gatt members in drive to end trade talks by new year MEMBER countries of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), including all the leading trading powers, yesterday agreed to re-organise the international trade talks in the hope they can be concluded by the end of this year. But their hope depends on two crucial developments occurring outside the forum for the talks in Geneva: The US Congress has to agree by the end of May to the continuation of President George Bush's 'fast-track' authority to negotiate trade agreements; The European Community has to give within the next four months what one negotiator called 'an unmistakable signal' of its readiness to go further than it has done so far in negotiating the reform of world farm trade. Agriculture was the issue which brought about the collapse of the meeting of world trade ministers at Brussels in December, which was to have concluded the four-year Uruguay Round of trade liberalising talks. Delegations in Geneva yesterday approved a proposal by Mr Rubens Ricupero, Gatt chairman, that the 15 subjects, which had been under separate negotiation in the Round, be concentrated into seven groups under different moderators. Mr Arthur Dunkel, Gatt director-general, will lead the agricultural talks and also chair the group handling textiles and clothing. Mr Germain Denis, Canada's assistant deputy minister for international trade affairs, will take charge of the market access group, which will negotiate reductions in tariffs and non-tariff barriers and the lowering of obstacles to trade in tropical goods and in products based on natural resources. Negotiations on a Gatt agreement to protect intellectual property rights remain under the guidance of Mr Lars Anell, Sweden's ambassador to Gatt. Talks aimed at reaching rules governing foreign investment are being incorporated into a 'rule-making' group under Brazil's Mr Georges Marciel. This group will deal with a heterogeneous mixture, including anti-dumping action, subsidies, safeguard measures, technical barriers to trade, rules of origin and government procurement. Mr Julio Lacarte-Muro, Uruguay's ambassador, retains responsibility for talks on improvements to Gatt's dispute settlement system, functioning and institutional practices, which were already close to success in December. A seventh group under Mr Felipe Jaramillo, Colombian ambassador, will continue efforts to reach an ambitious agreement, setting rules for the worldwide Dollars 770bn (Pounds 452m) trade in services. Mr Jaramillo will be assisted by Mr David Hawes, Australian ambassador. The new groupings are expected to meet by the middle of May and set agendas for the rest of the year. Mr Dunkel stressed that the new negotiating structure was designed to achieve political breakthroughs. But many negotiators consider that serious talks are likely to restart only in September, if by then the US administration has renewed negotiating authority and the EC has given the required signal on agriculture.</p>

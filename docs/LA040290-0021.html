			<p><P> April 2, 1990, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> AMERICA'S SCHOONER CUP;  </P> <P> ASTOR'S CREW PICKS UP WHERE WIND LEFT OFF  </P> <P> In Saturday's fleet race of the America's Schooner Cup, Astor skipper Richard  Stramar left the sailing up to the wind. That was good enough for a two-minute  victory over Dauntless.  </P> <P> But in Sunday's match race with Dauntless for the Schooner Cup, there was no  wind in sight -- so little, in fact, that the start had to be delayed an hour.  </P> <P> So without his schooner's best friend alongside, Straman was forced to turn to  another trusty companion, his 12-member crew.  </P> <P> It did not let him down.  </P> <P> Although it trailed for more than half the 10-mile match race, Astor wound up  beating Dauntless by a bigger margin than Saturday, three minutes, 48 seconds,  corrected time.  </P> <P> Astor was given a three-minute handicap because of its larger dimensions.  Stramar's schooner, built in 1924 by William Fife, is 15 feet longer than  Dauntless, built in 1930 by John Alden.  </P> <P> "This crew was great today," Straman said. "We had to make a lot of sail  changes."  </P> <P> After getting off to a great start Saturday on San Diego Bay, Astor almost  didn't get started at all Sunday -- missing the buoy at the starting line by  inches. If Astor had hit the marker, it would have had to start over.  </P> <P> "That was a little too close," Straman said.  </P> <P> Dauntless, skippered by Paul Plotts, took advantage of Astor's start to gain  the early lead.  </P> <P> "The first weather leg didn't go as well as we'd have liked, and we figured it  would only get worse," Straman said.  </P> <P> Instead, it only got better.  </P> <P> Just before the halfway mark, Astor put up a fisherman's sail and began to take  control.  </P> <P> It led by 30 seconds at the mark and stretched that out considerably as the  wind began to pick up.  </P> <P> The Schooner Cup was Straman's first in three attempts. Last year he lost to  Kelpie in the finals. Dauntless won the initial Schooner Cup in 1987.  </P> <P> The Bagheera, Saturday's third-place finisher, won the consolation title by 29  minutes over Volunteer.  </P></p>

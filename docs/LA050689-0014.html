			<p><P> May 6, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHRIS MULLIN IS HARDLY A 'POOR MAN'S' BIRD  </P> <P> My only complaint about Mark Heisler's welcome article on Golden State Coach  Don Nelson was the reference to Chris Mullin as being a "poor man's Larry  Bird." To call him that is unfair to Mullin, who may not win most improved  player of the year because of his past problems, but he easily wins most  improved man in my book.  </P> <P> And don't be too surprised if Mullin should one day play for Boston after the  Bird flies into retirement.  </P> <P> I can hear the Los Angeles sportswriters cussing old Red Auerbach right now.  </P> <P> DAVE DEL VAL  </P> <P> Laguna Niguel  </P></p>

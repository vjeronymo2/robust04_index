			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / Economics: More bad news for France FRIDAY WILL be an uncomfortable day for the French government with the release of unemployment statistics for June. The expected rise in the rate of unemployment to 11.6 per cent comes at a time when the government is under pressure to ease monetary policy, but is prevented from doing so because of its commitment to keeping the franc at its current value against other European currencies. Until Germany eases its interest rates, short of leaving the European exchange rate mechanism, it appears that the French government will have to preside over the unpopular combination of high unemployment and high real interest rates. There will be no easing of pressure on the UK government this week. Although strong economic statistics are working in the government's favour - the Confederation of British Industry's industrial trends survey tomorrow is expected to confirm a steady economic recovery - the Conservative party looks set to lose the Christchurch by-election on Thursday. The following are some of the week's other economic highlights and events. The figures in brackets are the median of economists' forecasts from MMS International, a financial information company.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interviews with Hungarian Democratic Forum leaders by </F> unidentified correspondents; place and date not given; speakers  identified by caption -- recorded]    [Excerpts] [Sandor Lezsak, former executive deputy chairman  of the Hungarian Democratic Forum, MDF] The fact that I have  resigned the executive leadership of the Democratic Forum  reflects my view that everybody should take stock as to what  extent they were responsible for this very serious defeat.  [passage omitted]    [Peter Boross, prime minister and member of the MDF  Presidium] We have four years ahead of us during which we have  to construct a modern, professional political party in the true  European sense of the word by 1998--one that will be able to  represent social interests to become a governing force again.    [Correspondent] To outsiders you represent the liberal line  within the MDF, and now, you are the party's parliamentary group  leader. Does this also mean a change in the political line?    [Finance Minister Tamas Szabo] I really respect the  liberals,  the national liberals working within our circle. Although I  have never been a member of the Liberal Foundation, I have  always played a serious role in the Christian democratic circle  of the MDF, ever since it was formed. This is where my loyalty  lies. [passage omitted] So in this respect, my person will not  really bring change. [passage omitted]    Whenever there was trouble within the MDF, it was when  somebody wanted to push one or the other of the MDF's three main  ideological pillars--the national, the Christian democratic, and  the national liberal ideology--to the forefront. If any of  these trends becomes dominant the MDF is finished. [passage  omitted]    [Correspondent] Does Peter Boross really represent another  group within the MDF?    [Szabo] In my view, Peter Boross represents an extremely  pragmatic line and has an enormous capacity for organizing.  [passage omitted] He represents a fourth pragmatic wing and he,  as a man thinking in terms of organizing and organization,  approaches issues from a different angle. It is possible that  he will have difficulties because every stream feels that he  does not really represent any of them. [passage omitted]    [Correspondent] Does it mean, at the same time--since  tendencies are linked to persons--that there is an unresolved  debate in the MDF whether it should be a people's party, a  program party, a party of law and order, or an action party?  [passage omitted]    [MDF Chairman Lajos Fur] Obviously, it appears that winning  the next election will be possible only with the oft-mentioned  wider social basis, which is necessary in any case. Therefore,  it is obvious that the MDF should move into the direction of a  kind of people's party, which does not mean that the MDF will be  a mass party in that it will have a mass membership, but that it  should have a broad electoral basis; that it should put down  roots in the various strata of the people, in the various social  groups.    [Szabo] If anything can change in the MDF it is the fact  that  we will move in the direction of a completely balanced, modern  conservativism, one that does not require a change in the order  of values but demands a change of expression.    [MDF Deputy Balazs Horvath] The zealous and strong  attitude--  which, on more than one occasion has irritated people, often  unnecessarily--which exaggerated the national feature will  obviously weaken, will be pushed into the background, if not in  substance certainly in form.    [Correspondent] Does the MDF's defeat mean the defeat of the  unity of forces of national sentiments [nemzeti eroek] as well?    [Fur]] The forces of national sentiments competed in this  last election in a rather fragmented way--at least they were  divided into several parties--but if I add up the results of all  the parties of this kind, then I must say that their result was  not all that bad. After all, more than 1.5 million people voted  out of the 5.6 million for these parties, which means that this  kind of thinking or set of political ideologies already has a  wide basis. Obviously this basis must be broadened because, as  we have seen, an election cannot be won through this and in this  way. Possibly the fragmentation, too, needs to be resolved in  some form and the forces will have to be concentrated. [passage  omitted]</p>

and the Federal Trade Commission (``Commission''), an independent agency of the United States Government, established under the Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914, 15 U.S.C. 41,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Whereas <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> , on or about December 3, 1993, respondent entered into an agreement with Holy Cross Health System Corporation (``Holy Cross''), an Indiana corporation, whereby respondent will acquire from Holy Cross certain Holy Cross assets in Utah (hereinafter the ``Acquisition''); and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Whereas <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> , the Commission is now investigating the Acquisition to determine if it would violate any of the statutes enforced by the Commission; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Whereas <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> , if the Commission accepts the attached Agreement Containing Consent Order (``Consent Order''), which would require the divestiture of certain assets listed in Schedule A of the Consent Order (``Schedule A Assets''), including Holy Cross Hospital (``HCH'') in Salt Lake City, Utah, the Commission must place the Consent Order on the public record for a period of at least sixty (60) days and may subsequently withdraw such acceptance pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.34 of the Commission's Rules' and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Whereas <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> , the Commission is concerned that if an understanding is not reached, preserving the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> status quo ante <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  of the Schedule A Assets during the period prior to the final acceptance and issuance of the Consent Order by the Commission (after the 60-day public comment period), divestiture resulting from any proceeding challenging the legality of the Acquisition might not be possible, or might be less than an effective remedy; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Whereas <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> , the Commission is concerned that if the Acquisition is consummated, it will be necessary to preserve the Commission's ability to require the divestiture of the Schedule A Assets as described in Paragraph II of the Consent Order and the Commission's right to have HCH continue as a viable independent acute care hospital; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Whereas <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> , the purpose of this Agreement and the Consent Order is to: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) preserve HCH as a viable independent acute care hospital pending its divestiture, and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) remedy any anticompetitive effects of the Acquisition; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Whereas <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> , respondent's entering into this Agreement shall in no way be construed as an admission by respondent that the Acquisition is illegal; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Whereas <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> , respondent understands that no act or transaction contemplated by this Agreement shall be deemed immune or exempt from the provisions of the antitrust laws or the Federal Trade Commission Act by reason of anything contained in this Agreement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Now, therefore, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  the parties agree, upon understanding that the Commission has not yet determined whether the Acquisition will be challenged, and in consideration of the Commission's agreement that, unless the Commission determines to reject the Consent Order, it will not seek further relief from respondent with respect to the Acquisition, except that the Commission may exercise any and all rights to enforce this Agreement and the Consent Order to which it is annexed and made a part thereof, and in the event the required divestiture is not accomplished, to appoint a trustee to seek divestiture of the Schedule A Assets pursuant to the Consent Order, as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Respondent agrees to execute the Agreement Containing Consent Order and be bound by the attached Consent Order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

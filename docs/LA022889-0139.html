			<p><P> February 28, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> U.S. SHOE TO SELL ITS NAME, FOOTWEAR DIVISION, OFFICES  </P> <P> United States Shoe Corp. announced Monday that it will sell its footwear  division, its name and its Cincinnati headquarters to a management-led group  for $422.5 million in cash.  </P> <P> The purchase excludes U.S. Shoe's Cincinnati-based LensCrafters division, which  operates retail eyeglass stores, and the women's apparel retail division, based  in Enfield, Conn.  </P> <P> Key executives of U.S. Shoe's footwear division, including Howard Platt, a  company executive vice president who is president of the footwear division, are  leaders in the purchasing group, U.S. Shoe said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 500 Retail Stores  </P> <P> The deal involves its major footwear distribution center in Cincinnati. U.S.  Shoe said it will surrender its name to the new company and choose another name  more suited to its remaining businesses.  </P> <P> The division makes, imports and sells footwear and operates about 500 retail  stores. It sells boots through its Texas Boot and Wrangler Boot divisions and  markets women's footwear lines Amalfi, Bandolino, Calvin Klein, Capezio,  Cobbie, David Evins, Easy Spirit, Evan Picone, Garolini, Innovations, Joyce,  Liz Claiborne, Pappagallo, Red Cross Shoes and Selby.  </P> <P> The transaction is to be concluded within 90 days. U.S. Shoe's board of  directors said it plans to use some of the proceeds of the sale to raise the  dividend on the stock to $1 this year from 46 cents.  </P> <P> The company said it expects that the net proceeds will total $390 million,  after taxes and expenses, and is subject to possible adjustments of the  purchase price before the transaction is closed.  </P> <P> Up to $50 million of the proceeds will be used to pay off long-term debts, U.S.  Shoe officials said.  </P> <P> Merrill Lynch Capital Partners Inc., an affiliate of Merrill Lynch Capital  Markets, is leading the investment group and has provided commitments for $160  million of equity and subordinated debt financing for the transaction, U.S.  Shoe said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Potential for Growth  </P> <P> Philip G. Barach, chairman and chief executive of U.S. Shoe, said the sale  results from an overall review the company announced last August to explore  ways it could increase corporate value to the shareholders.  </P> <P> "As part of this process, approximately 80 parties worldwide were contacted in  an effort to solicit offers for all of U.S. Shoe or for any of its businesses,"  he said.  </P> <P> Barach said no prospective buyer wanted to acquire all of U.S. Shoe or made an  acceptable offer for the women's apparel division. Several bidders made offers  for the LensCrafters division, but it was retained in part because of its  strong potential for growth, he said.  </P></p>

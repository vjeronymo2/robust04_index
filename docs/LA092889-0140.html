			<p><P> September 28, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH PLANS NEW AID TO COLOMBIA;  </P> <P> U.S. HOPES TO COUNTER PRESSURE ON BOGOTA TO END ANTI-DRUG WAR  </P> <P> President Bush plans to offer new assistance to Colombian President Virgilio  Barco Vargas, including possible support for financially depressed coffee  growers, to counter mounting pressure on Bogota to call off its war on the drug  cartels, sources said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Bush will discuss the additional U.S. help at the White House today in what  will be his first face-to-face meeting with Barco since the Colombian leader,  backed by $65 million in emergency U.S. military assistance, declared war on  drug traffickers last month.  </P> <P> Since that time, the Barco government has been unable to contain a wave of  terrorist attacks launched by the powerful cocaine cartels, and influential  Colombians have begun urging the government to negotiate with the drug  kingpins.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Moral Support'  </P> <P> "The specific signal is (that) you want to show support for him and put an arm  around the guy and say, 'We're with you,' " a White House official said. He  called the scheduled session a "meeting of moral support."  </P> <P> Administration officials said the specific contents of the assistance package  have not yet been determined. "We want to find out what we can do that would be  most helpful to him," one official said.  </P> <P> Maintaining the momentum of the Colombian crackdown is of crucial importance to  the Administration's new anti-drug strategy, which places increased emphasis on  U.S.-backed efforts to disrupt the supply of drugs at their source in the  Andean nations of South America.  </P> <P> Any sign of capitulation by the Colombian government could weaken congressional  support for the rest of the Administration's Andean initiative, which calls for  $2 billion in military and economic assistance to Peru, Bolivia and Colombia  over the next five years.  </P> <P> "This is a real make-or-break time," said Robert J. Kurz, a scholar at the  Brookings Institution. "Either you redouble your efforts and get stronger, or  you begin to drift back to the normal kind of bickering."  </P> <P> "Undoubtedly," an Administration official said, "we're coming to an important  juncture."  </P> <P> The pressures on Barco to back away from the anti-drug crackdown have resulted,  in large part, from the relentless bombings that are part of the cartels'  "total war" on the government.  </P> <P> The cumulative effect of more than 100 attacks so far appears to have persuaded  important sectors of Colombia's population that the struggle against the  powerful traffickers is not worth the risk it entails.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Extradition Decision Due  </P> <P> At the same time, the Colombian Supreme Court is nearing a long-awaited  decision on the constitutionality of a major weapon in the crackdown: a  provision that permits extradition of some traffickers for trial in the United  States.  </P> <P> With most observers expecting the court to undermine the government's power,  some fear that the days of the anti-drug offensive already are numbered.  </P> <P> "A crackdown is an episodic application of force," said Renssalaer Lee, an  adjunct professor at American University who is an expert on Colombia. "I don't  think that the Colombian government can maintain the current crackdown with the  current level of intensity."  </P> <P> Among the plans being considered by the White House to help bolster the  beleaguered government are a pledge to take the lead in repairing an  international coffee agreement. Collapse of the pact last month produced a free  fall in coffee prices that could cost Colombia up to $400 million in  foreign-exchange income.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Coffee Price Accord  </P> <P> A senior U.S. official emphasized that the international nature of the accord  means that the United States cannot by itself resurrect the price agreement.  But he said he expects the White House to offer to convene new negotiations  aimed at boosting prices paid to Colombian growers.  </P> <P> Other possible offers could include U.S. promises to lower barriers to key  Colombian imports, including cut flowers, and to accelerate the deployment of a  fleet of armored cars already promised for the protection of Colombian judges,  officials said.  </P> <P> At the same time, the President indicated that he expects to honor an earlier  request from Barco that the United States sponsor a "high-level drug meeting  with the presidents of various countries."  </P> <P> "I'll be very interested in his view on it and . . . how that could help on  this fight," Bush said in an interview with a small group of reporters in the  Oval Office. The President said he believes such a meeting would be "a  constructive thing."  </P> <P> Such gestures could help assuage Colombian concerns that the United States has  given too high a priority to military solutions to that country's drug  problems.  </P> <P> Officials in Bogota have complained that the $65 million in U.S. assistance  provided so far has been largely ill-suited to the anti-drug effort. Instead,  they have urged economic assistance to prop up impoverished sectors of their  country's legal economy.  </P> <P> Before departing for Washington, Barco made clear through the Colombian Embassy  in Washington that he plans to ask the United States for help in restoring the  system of coffee quotas. The Colombian press also reported that Barco will seek  tariff reductions as part of a bid for more "international backing" for his  anti-drug effort.  </P> <P> Despite the pressures against him, Barco has stood firm in his determination to  persist in the anti-drug offensive and has refused to consider negotiations  with the drug lords. And White House officials insisted there are no  indications that Barco's resolve is crumbling.  </P> <P> In a surprise address Tuesday evening, broadcast nationwide on television and  radio, Barco warned Colombians that the traffickers want to "destroy the most  precious thing Colombians have -- their democracy."  </P> <P> At the same time, he announced the conclusion of a peace accord with the April  19 movement, also known as M-19, a 2,000-member guerrilla organization that has  been battling government forces for more than a decade.  </P> <P> The government continues to negotiate with five other guerrilla forces. Its  willingness to strike deals with such adversaries, but not with the cocaine  cartels, is seen as evidence of Barco's determination to concentrate government  resources on the anti-drug effort.  </P> <P> As part of its effort to shore up Barco, the White House might include  assistance without making the details public, one official said.  </P> <P> For example, he said, Bush and Barco likely will discuss contingencies under  which Colombia could continue to wage its anti-drug effort even if its Supreme  Court invalidates the extradition treaty.  </P> <P> In addition, given the suspicions felt by many Colombians about U.S.  intentions, other aid might be more beneficial if offered quietly, rather than  with a made-in-the-U.S.A. label, the official added.  </P> <P> "It's clear that we want to be helpful to Barco," he said. "It's not clear that  everything we do would be helpful if it is done publicly."  </P> <P> Times staff writer James Gerstenzang contributed to this report.  </P></p>

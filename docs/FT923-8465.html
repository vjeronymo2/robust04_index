			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / Action demanded over sea pollution GREENPEACE, the environmental pressure group, yesterday accused the government of allowing companies to make the UK the worst sea polluter in western Europe. It said government data showed that 5,046 tonnes of toxic waste a year was going into the seas. It also claimed that a report from the National Rivers Authority (NRA) would show that this has led to seas off the rivers Thames, Humber, Tees, Tyne, Wyre, Mersey, Dee, Severn and Solent becoming pollution 'hot spots'. Mr Tim Birch, Greenpeace toxics campaigner, said: 'The public need to know the government and NRA are allowing British industry to destroy our rivers and seas.' Greenpeace is calling on the government to set clear timetables for the phasing out of toxic discharges. Its ship Solo is to tour the most polluted areas, starting with visits to the Wash and the Humber tomorrow. The campaign is aimed at drawing attention to the problem before western European environment ministers meet in Paris next month to agree a new convention to protect seas into the next century.</p>

			<p><P> April 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: THE BRIDE WHO RAN AWAY BY DIANA O'HEHIR (WASHINGTON SQUARE  PRESS / POCKET BOOKS: $6.95)  </P> <P> "Grazia: How can you be a Dowell and be so free of despair?," Steve writes to  his first cousin and fiance Grace Dowell, the novel's narrator. "An optimistic  Dowell . . . is not natural."  </P> <P> The Dowell clan is indisputably an eccentric lot. Grace's great-aunt Sybil may  be certifiably mad, and Grace's older cousin Steve -- handsome, possibly  brilliant, and definitely impenetrable -- is pretentious and unpleasant.  </P> <P> Grace, a bright, well-adjusted 19-year-old, has been in love with Steve since  age 3. Now her aunt Sybil and a fortuneteller named Fleesha the Futurist are  warning her to break loose from a "Disastrous Attachment."  </P> <P> And, when Grace discovers a mysterious connection between Steve and the suicide  of a newly married second cousin, she becomes "the bride who ran away."  </P> <P> A friend from childhood, David "Duke" McCracken, himself has reasons to flee  after witnessing a crime implicating his older brothers. So the fugitive and  the runaway stumble from truck stops to casinos in Reno to low-grade diners,  always just one step ahead of the law.  </P> <P> A tale both merry and sad of innocence lost and personal declarations of  independence.  </P></p>

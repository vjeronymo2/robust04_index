			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with S. Afonin, chairman of Roskommetallurgiya, </F> by Vladimir Smyk, RIA NOVOSTI correspondent (especially for  RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA); place and date not given: "At Magnitka,  Hurrah!"]    [Text] The first stage of the 2000 Hot-Rolling Mill  was put into operation at Magnitogorsk Metallurgical Combine on  21 May. In connection with this RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA asked S.  Afonin, chairman of Roskommetallurgiya, to answer a number of  questions.    [Smyk] Serafim Zakharovich, even when the country's economy  was on the rise, central newspapers reported an event of such  scope in big headlines. But in our days it inspires us with  special feeling: Not only bankruptcies of enterprises and the  shutdown of main conveyers are today's reality. Of course, this  is an emotional evaluation by a journalist. Do professionals  subscribe to it?    [Afonin] Indeed, today, during a period when we face  difficult questions and are engaged in a search for a way out of  the crisis that has affected the economy, such concepts as  "labor victory" sound unusual. However, for those that with  their own hands built the 2000 Hot-Rolling Mill and for those  that will work on it--moreover, for all workers at the  Magnitogorsk Metallurgical Combine--the day of 21 May was a true  holiday.    [Smyk] What does the production line represent?    [Afonin] These are six roughing stands, through which a  billet passes in stages. At the entry it is 250 mm thick.  Passing a 1/2-km path, the slab turns into a sheet about 2 mm  thick. Right after the roughing this rolled metal, a so-called  plate, is of independent industrial significance. It is used for  various kinds of structures in the machine-building and  construction industry. It must be stated that the combine,  before commissioning the first stage, found orders for plate,  that is, expenditures on the construction of the project will  begin to be recovered before the commissioning of the second  stage. The 2000 Hot-Rolling Mill with an annual productivity of  5 million tonnes of rolled metal (the real load will be 4  million) will be commissioned in August.    [Smyk] Can existing rolling capacities coexist with the new  ones?    [Afonin] No. Two obsolete mills are now being removed from  service at the combine. In general, it must be said that the  construction of the 2000 Hot-Rolling Mill represents a central  moment in the reconstruction of the leader of Russian  metallurgy--the Magnitogorsk Combine--carried out in three  stages.    [Smyk] How many work places are vacated at the combine as a  result of the reconstruction?    [Afonin] In all, 15,000. The program for the creation of new  work places is being actively realized right now. People working  with obsolete equipment under quite difficult conditions are  offered a number of new production facilities, that is, of  machine-building and construction specialization. A new bakery  has been commissioned and a meat combine is on the eve of a  start-up... Today the Magnitogorsk Metallurgical Combine is a  multispecialization joint-stock company--no one will remain  without a job. The combine's modernization will have a  beneficial effect on the working and living conditions of  workers at the Magnitogorsk Metallurgical Combine. The federal  program for the retooling of metallurgy is being truly realized  in this Ural city.    [Smyk] The next question concerns financing: How much did  the  2000 mill cost and how did you manage to find funds?    [Afonin] At present prices, approximately 1 trillion rubles.  Its construction began at the end of the 1980's. Therefore, the  combine managed to get substantial state support. It amounted to  approximately 60 percent. Magnitka earned the rest of the money  itself.    [Smyk] The situation has changed now. The new budget is  another evidence of this. Can the federal program be fulfilled  without strong state subsidies?    [Afonin] State support must be expressed in the government's  creation of optimum conditions for enterprises, under which they  could earn money. We laid down the following principle in the  federal program for the modernization of metallurgy:  Metallurgists expect to earn more than 90 percent of the  necessary funds themselves.    [Smyk] Does this mean that metallurgists are fully satisfied  with government activity?    [Afonin] For a start, let us discuss what we are not  satisfied with. First, with the fact that the problem of  nonpayments is being solved slowly; second, with the way rates  of railroad transport and of electric power are being formed.  The government must work out a system of measures so that the  transport and energy components of the cost of products are not  a burden on the entire economy. Third, naturally, taxes. We  criticized our colleagues from the Ministry of Finance. During  the formation of the budget it is incorrect to proceed from the  principle: balance for the sake of balance. Furthermore, under  crisis conditions the budget part should not be collected from  enterprises by all conceivable and inconceivable extortions. As  a result, the producer is left with funds, which often are not  sufficient for the organization of simple reproduction, not to  mention expanded reproduction.    [Smyk] As far as I know, at a recent economic conference in  Lipetsk managers of the metallurgical complex worked out  proposals for the government, including on tax policy.    [Afonin] They are now in the government, and I cannot say,  in  order to put them off indefinitely. At a meeting with managers  of industrial and transport enterprises during the signing of  the "Agreement on Accord" Viktor Stepanovich Chernomyrdin said  that the government saw the corrections, including in the tax  system, which should motivate production growth. Apparently,  however, the correction of tax policy will begin not earlier  than next year.</p>

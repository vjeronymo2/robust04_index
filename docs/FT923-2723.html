			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Lower exceptionals cut AB Electronics' loss  -Takeover discussions continue with TT following exchange of site visits RESTRUCTURING COSTS and a fall in sales were blamed by AB Electronics, the components manufacturer, for another deficit over the year to June 30. The final dividend is omitted. AB is continuing friendly discussions with TT Group which may led to it being taken over by the acquisitive industrial holding company. TT recently took a 6.35 per cent stake in AB. The two sides have exchanged site visits which led to further negotiations last week. TT has now asked for further information. AB's loss before tax of Pounds 11.2m (Pounds 14.8m) was struck after an exceptional charge of Pounds 4.6m (Pounds 10.9m) to cover redundancies and costs associated with the rationalisation of the ongoing businesses. Last year's results have been restated to comply with the Accounting Standards Board. The effect has been to increase the loss in 1991 since reorganisation and restructuring costs accounted for as an extraordinary item have been restated as exceptional items. Sales fell from Pounds 213.4m to Pounds 171.2m. The operating loss rose to Pounds 2.75m (Pounds 66,000). Losses per share were 34.9p (36.4p). Mr Paul Ryder, managing director, said the group decided not to pay a dividend since the expense of administering last year's notional dividend of 0.1p was too costly. A strong performance from the German-based sensors business helped the automotive division report an increased operating profit of Pounds 2m (Pounds 1.7m). The group is in talks to sell its loss-making UK-based automotive electronic systems. The operating loss at the components division increased to Pounds 3.75m (Pounds 2.6m). Loss-making Swansea Industrial, which makes electrical harnesses, is also about to be sold. The assemblies division incurred a loss of Pounds 46,000 compared with an operating profit of Pounds 2.4m. The old resale and distribution division reduced its operating loss from Pounds 1.3m to Pounds 964,000. Borrowings fell to Pounds 25.8m (Pounds 28.7m) representing gearing of 89 per cent. COMMENT News of TT's continued interest cut little ice with the market. The shares fell 10p to close at 47p, capitalising the group at Pounds 13m. This is less than the sum the company might be reasonably expected to raise for two of its loss-making businesses. It appears that the market is unsure whether the group can survive. With forecasts of another small pre-tax loss or the possibility of breaking even the outlook is bleak. In the group's favour are the planned disposals which could cut borrowings by half, the refocusing of its core businesses, increased cost cutting with the loss of another 400 jobs and the possibility of a takeover. However, it remains a risky recovery stock. For that reason most investors will want to wait longer before committing themselves.</p>

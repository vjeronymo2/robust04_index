			<p><P> May 20, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MAGISTRATE CALLS HER 'LOOSE CANNON';  </P> <P> PROSECUTOR SUSPENDED OVER TRIAL TACTIC  </P> <P> A veteran Los Angeles County prosecutor, branded a "loose cannon" by a federal  magistrate, has been suspended amid charges of deliberate misconduct in an  attempt to gain a tactical advantage in a 1988 robbery trial.  </P> <P> Rosalie L. Morton, a deputy district attorney in the San Fernando Courthouse,  last week was suspended with pay based on a preliminary review of the case by  U.S. Magistrate Volney V. Brown, said Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. Gregory  Thompson.  </P> <P> "Morton is a loose cannon who the district attorney cannot or will not  control," Brown wrote in his review. "Her misconduct has made her a local  legend in her own time."  </P> <P> The allegations stem from a robbery trial in which Morton, 66, introduced  evidence in her opening statement to the jury that the judge had ruled  inadmissible.  </P> <P> A mistrial was subsequently declared. Immediately after the proceeding, Morton  filed a motion to disqualify the trial judge, Judge Dana Senit Henry. The  motion was denied.  </P> <P> Defense attorneys then filed a plea with Henry to have the case dismissed  altogether. They charged that Morton forced a mistrial in an attempt to have  the case retried before a new judge who would admit the suppressed evidence.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Refused Request  </P> <P> Henry ultimately rejected the request, saying that she "believed that Morton's  actions were based on a misconception of the court's ruling," according to  court documents.  </P> <P> After a similar plea was rejected by the California Court of Appeal, the  defense refiled the motion in U.S. District Court, where it is now pending.  </P> <P> In his review of the motion, Brown noted that Morton has been cited on several  different occasions for misconduct by the state Court of Appeal. He quoted one  instance in which Morton allegedly told the state court that she "takes pride"  in her admonitions by the court.  </P> <P> Morton "does dishonor not only to herself," Brown wrote, "but to her profession  . . . the State Bar should now consider whether she should be disbarred."  </P> <P> Deputy Public Defender Henry J. Hall, one of three defense attorneys who filed  the plea, said the state attorney general had until this weekend to file a  response. If no response is filed, Hall said, the robbery case will  automatically be dismissed.  </P> <P> However, he said, the attorney general could appeal the case.  </P> <P> Thompson said that if the allegations against Morton, a 19-year veteran of the  Los Angeles County district attorney's office, are found to be true, she would  be subject to disciplinary action, ranging from a letter of reprimand to  possible termination.  </P> <P> Last month, a Los Angeles County prosecutor was suspended for 30 days without  pay for misrepresenting evidence to obtain a first-degree murder conviction.  The judge in that case later reduced the jury's guilty verdict to second-degree  murder and referred the matter to the State Bar.  </P></p>

Nine soldiers of this  force have already been dismissed due to political activities.  It is not yet known to which group or groups these soldiers  belonged.    [Begin correspondent Richard Newton recording] It is thought  that the base of the National Peacekeeping force at De Brug  outside Bloemfontein is a cauldron of dissension on the verge of  boiling over. Some allege that language, ethnic, and political  differences have led to a lack of cooperation. Repeated  requests to visit the base, also requests to have interviews  recorded, have been refused. A media day, however, has been  arranged at the base for next week Thursday.    The acting commander of the National Peacekeeping Force,  Col.  Fred Burger, responded to our question by fax, confirming that  cooperation between the troops at the base had become a problem.  He added, however, that soldiers from such diverse groups needed  time to adapt. Col. Burger rejected rumors of racial tension  and physical assaults among the troops, saying they were false.  What is in fact true, he said, is that there is room for  improvement regarding hygiene; that limited intimidation has  been noted, and that more than 20 soldiers had requested to  return to their units.    The media visit to the base next week could help to  eliminate  some of the rumors. The commander of the peace force, Gen.  Ramushwana, will nevertheless have his hands full when he takes  over command next week. [end recording]    The first group of voluntary military recruits after decades  of military service today joined the South African Defense  Force. Five thousand young men from all population groups  reported at centers in Durban, Cape Town, Pretoria, and  Johannesburg. A large group was turned away in Johannesburg.    [Begin correspondent Nan Roux recording] Hundreds of young  men began gathering in front of the gates at Nasrec [convention  center] outside Johannesburg this morning. For many it was a  waste of time, however. Only those with the right  qualifications and documents were allowed through the gates. A  very disconcerted group had to remain outside. Inside the  gates, though, those with the right documents marched away in  real military style for their first taste of the Defense Force.  The recruits will be sent to bases in Pretoria and  Bloemfontein, and to Potchefstroom and Heidelberg. After eight  months of initial training, they will be able to join either the  Defense Force's corps services or the Citizen Force. [end  recording]</p>

			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Idle network time put to work Using 'idle' computer time to process other tasks in the background is an old idea, writes Claire Gooding. This principle has been applied to PC networks by Jetstream, 66 per cent owned by New Zealand Telecom. Its Jetnet software shares out heavy processing workloads between networked PCs while other users on the network are away or performing low-power tasks such as word processing. It claims Jetnet introduces genuine parallel processing across PC networks. The 'unused' power - which Jetstream says might amount to 80 per cent in some networks - can in theory be capitalised to support heavy transaction processing loads, tasks previously limited to mid-range and mainframe computers. The Jetnet applications development toolkit costs around Pounds 9,500 in the UK. HTL Information Technology (distributor): UK, 081 765 1392</p>

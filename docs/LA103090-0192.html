This was  the eighth consecutive monthly decline.  </P> <P> The October, 1980, survey found that 46% of respondents were negative on the  economy.  </P> <P> "Manufacturing industry is clearly facing very tough economic and trading  conditions, and many firms are now battening down the hatches and preparing to  ride out the storm," said David Wigglesworth, chairman of the CBI committee  that compiled the study.  </P></p>

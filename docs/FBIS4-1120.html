			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Inkatha Freedom Party leader Mangosuthu </F> Buthelezi by announcer Penny Smythe on the "Agenda" program in  Johannesburg-- live]    [Text] [Smythe] Good evening and welcome to Agenda. The  Inkatha Freedom Party's 11th hour decision to partake in the  elections. Was it brinkmanship or a real change of heart? If  one had to go according to newspaper headlines today, the level  of violence in the country has plummeted. Has this been as a  result of the IFP's decision. To answer these and other  questions is Chief Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi. Good evening,  Dr. Buthelezi.    Well, you have waited as we say, til the 11th hour -- just  one week before the election to decide to take part in those  elections. Why?    [Buthelezi] We had decided in January not to participate,  but  then we were given some kind of authority as a Central Committee  to look at what was then ongoing negotiations to see whether in  fact we could change the decision, and various things took  place. In the Freedom Alliance we were negotiating with the ANC  and government, and later on there were trilateral talks in  December when there was that paper called the yellow paper on  the 19th of December, which was more or less the bottom line  paper, and then after that, of course -- since nothing came out  of it.    Then in January the king came out demanding sovereignty of  the monarchy and so on, which made a completely different ball  game altogether. So then when the king raised this matter, it  became very difficult for us, those of us who are IFP and also  Zulus to move forward because the king said if his concerns were  not addressed, then he was not prepared to advise his people --  his subjects -- to participate in the election. So I mean that  is the thing then when the king's matter was addressed, then  there was no excuse for us to go in for elections.    [Smythe] Was this not actually addressed two weeks ago  before  the mediators came out here?    [Buthelezi] By whom?    [Smythe] By the NP [National Party], by the ANC and  negotiations. They didn't offer you what you wanted?    [Buthelezi] That was just cheap propaganda by the ANC and  the  and the NP because what was discussed at Skukuza were just pacts  which they were promising the king. They didn't address the  issue of the kingdom itself. The king was not interested in  pacts for himself and the family, but he was actually talking  about the land. He was talking about his people.    [Smythe] What have you achieved for the Zulu people in  general and the IFP in particular that wasn't achievable two  weeks ago or a month ago. What specifically have you achieved  for the king as well?    [Buthelezi] I think that for the king we've achieved this  recognition now which is going to be enshrined in the  constitution of the country, and that was not anywhere near the  king a few weeks ago, even at Skukuza. But on Monday a special  session of the Parliament of South Africa has been summoned to  actually enshrine this in the constitution.    [Smythe] But he will be a constitutional monarch, that he  will have certain... what will he have? What will actually be  his status in kwaZulu/Natal?    [Buthelezi] That will come out now when the constitution of  kwaZulu/Natal is actually drafted, because the constitution of  kwaZulu/Natal is not drafted. The constitution that we drafted  a couple of years ago in fact was never put before the  negotiation forum, so it was never actually looked at by the  negotiation forum.    [Smythe] So the king wanted specific rights enshrined in a  constitution. Am I correct in that? He wanted certain status.  Now what specifically was that?    [Buthelezi] Well, because you see, as long as we were  talking  about a federation, a possible federation, then the king thought  that the self-determination of the Zulu people would then be  addressed through a federal formula, because a federal formula  does provide for self-rule on a regional basis with devolution  of power. Whereas in fact once it's a unitary state, then it  meant that that question would not be addressed, and that is why  he decided to take it upon himself to go and see the state  president and had a few meetings subsequent to that with the  state president.    [Smythe] Other than the status of the king, what do you  feel you have achieved to allow you to take part?    [Buthelezi] I think that the recognition that the principle  of our symmetry which from the very beginning of negotiations we  tried to persuade the people at the negotiation forum to  recognize the principle of our symmetry that these regions need  not necessarily be the same, so the fact that kwaZulu/Natal is  going to be a kingdom that's accepted right across the board is  in fact a recognition of the principle of our symmetry that  kwaZulu/Natal is different and, therefore, it is likely to have  a constitution different from other regions of South Africa.    [Smythe] Dr. Buthelezi, we've seen a great deal of violence  in the last few weeks. Do you feel now looking back over these  last few weeks that it's been worth the cost of lives lost and  the cost to the economy of that uncertainty by people.    [Buthelezi] If I should answer that question I'll be  implying  that we are the cause of the violence, whereas the violence has  been there for 10 years in fact, and has become endemic. And I  would also say that, therefore, the violence also is of  different types because there is the sort of violence arising  from socioeconomic conditions, and then there's violence, of  course, which is political which goes to incite...[pauses]  violence which just comes about because of the conflict between  the ANC and IFP members -- which is the political violence, and  which members of both these parties, ANC and IFP were involved  in, are involved in fact because I don't think that we should  have an illusion that it's over. We should just praise the  Almighty at present we don't have that; and hope that with God's  grace that it might last for good.    [Smythe] Let's just take that there, you say that there's  political violence between the two groups, and I think that it's  an accepted fact that you might have some ANC members living on  a hill over there and some IFP members living on a hill over  there, and never the twain shall meet. Now the political  parties have felt that they weren't safe going into a lot of  areas to campaign. Are those sort of no go areas now free and  open? What are you going to do ensure that the people will  allow that kind of free campaigning?    [Buthelezi] I suppose that -- I am hoping myself that the  agreement that we signed with Mr. Mandela and the president of  South Africa somehow send some signals. This is just a hope of  course. They send signals to our followers on the ground that in  fact we believe that the only road that we should follow is that  of peace and nonviolence if we want our country to survive and  to prospwr.    [Smythe] You know, I just wanted you to go back on  something,  you mentioned the Freedom Alliance earlier on, and of course we  were watching the news before we came into the studio here this  evening. Watching Ferdi Hartzenberg there speaking on behalf of  the CP [Conservative Party] and saying our demands haven't been  met therefore we cannot take part in the election, words that  you've said many times. How do you feel now that you decided to  take part?    [Buthelezi] In fact I informed Dr. Hartzenberg about it that  even before we signed the agreement I sent him a (?call on  this). I was in Pretoria. I had to show him that in this case  the issue addressed really more realistically insofar as it was  going to be enshrined in the constitution on Monday, and that  therefore we had to undertake to participate in the election as  a result of that.    [Smythe] And of course it's too late for them now? Just you  made it by a whisker. And I think with all this going on,  there's been very little time for campaigning on an official  level. You've been at the center of South African political  life for many months now without doing any real campaigning.  Nobody really knows what your manifesto is. Could you give us  some kind of brief outline on let's say the economic policy of  the IFP toward kwaZulu/Natal in particular?    [Buthelezi] We've always believed in the free market. In  fact, that has always been the belief of the IFP as far as the  economy is concerned. We do not know of any economic system  that is better than the free enterprise system, and therefore  even when it was not fashionable in African circles to extol the  virtues of this enterprise system, we did so unashamedly, that  this enterprise system was the only system that we know that can  create jobs as quickly as possible, and is the only system that  is such a potent force for development, which our people need  very desperately. So we believe that our county can only go  forward, and we can only address the poverty of our people  through this enterprise system if it's allowed to flourish. We  believe that of course it will be necessary for the government  to intervene on certain issues...    [Smythe, interrupting] Where specifically do you see the  government being very important -- the state?    [Buthelezi] I think the state is important as far as  disparities which will be very much with us for quite a long  time to come because in this country per capita -- because of  apartheid and racism -- black people suffered, because in  education they were rather funded on a racial basis -- a sliding  basis, on a disparity basis if you like, and therefore we  believe that those gaps will have to be bridged only through the  intervention of the government.    [Smythe] Does that apply then to something like land  redistribution and the distribution of wealth which some people  are saying take from the rich to give to the poor -- just as a  random example. How do you see that as being dealt with?    [Buthelezi] In fact we also believe in the redistribution of  wealth, but we've always said that redistribution of wealth as  far as IFP is concerned means only redistribution of  opportunity. But that is quite separate of course from the  issue of land, because it is true that our people are land  hungry, and that is an issue that must be addressed because for  instance per square meter, I think that kwaZulu as far as  density is concerned, is the most crowded place in South Africa  -- dhe most crowded region. Durban, our metropolis, for  instance, is the fastest growing city in the world -- I'm told  -- after Mexico.    [Smythe] So how do you see that actually happening? How do  you see that being dealt with as an issue -- the land  redistribution?    [Buthelezi] First of all, there are stretches and stretches  of land which I call state lands, which of course after our  conquests was called Crown lands, which I think as a matter of  urgency should be distributed to our people and to enable our  people who want to farm for instance to farm. And there is also  the issue of absentee farming, where there are people who don't  farm at all but who have stretches and stretches of farms. I  think that also should be looked at to address that issue.    [Smythe] Right, when it comes to...[pauses] You mentioned  the economic situation as being the free market system, is one  that you would particularly follow as the IFP, as part of your  manifesto as being the main driving force behind job creation.  What about international investment, local investment, do you  see international investment as being very important?    [Buthelezi] Well, I think this really very important indeed,  because our country is in such dire straights at this time  precisely because of the isolation of South Africa, because of  the sanctions campaign. I tried to warn, because I was totally  against that myself. Whereas I was an opponent of apartheid and  campaigned against apartheid like many other African leaders in  this country, or opposition politicians here like the DP  [Democratic Party] and so on. But I warned about it -- going so  far as to say that because apartheid was such a wicked system,  let us now penalize whites by destroying the economy -- because  I said that would devastate the poorest of the poor first. So  we have a situation now where about 46 percent of the people  that should be working in this country have no jobs. So I mean  it is going to take us a long time before we are able to do  that. So foreign investment is absolutely crucial, it is very  important in contributing, but also investment by our own  entrepreneurs is important as well, equally important.    [Smythe] Alright, we've spoken about the IFP being a Zulu  party, as well as for other people, but primarily a party for  Zulu people. Now I'm not a Zulu person, why would I vote for  you?    [Buthelezi] Well, I think that is the propaganda, cheap  propaganda of our opponents, saying it is a Zulu party. In fact  there are some journalists that I refuse to speak to because  they always say it is a Zulu-based party. I don't see them  doing the same thing saying that the National Party is an  Afrikaner-based party. I don't see them saying about the DP  that's an Anglo-Saxon- based, a Judeo-Anglo party. So I think  that is just cheap propaganda.    I must recall that of course when Inkatha was only two  years,  I was summoned, you know, to Pretoria by Minister Kruger, you  know Jimmy Kruger, the famous Jimmy Kruger who talked about  Steve Biko's death, making [word indistinct]. Now he summoned  me to threaten me. He said that he sees -- and it was only two  years -- he said he sees that, you know, membership of Inkatha  is not confined to Zulus. So I told him that in fact it wasn't.  Then he said that I was polarizing black and white in the  country and said that if I didn't stop it he'd take action. I  said that as long as the National Party takes pride of different  ethnic groups in the white community, I had the same rights, so  that stands out as evidence that even when we were two years  old, through his intelligence services he discovered that it was  not confined to Zulus only.    [Smythe] Alright, but then why would a person vote for the  IFP. What do you feel you can give to a South African citizen?    [Buthelezi] Well, I think that our track record in the first  place, that people know us, and they have every reason to trust  us, that we have been motivated in everything that we have done,  by the interest, not just of people in kwaZulu/Natal or black  people, but the interest of every South African. Because when  we campaigned for instance against sanctions, we were not doing  this just for ourselves, but we were doing it in the interest of  South Africa as a whole because we didn't want South Africa to  be a wasteland.    [Smythe] You've said in press reports that you will accept  the results of this election provided that the international  community says, you know, everything was okay and it was free  and fair. What happens if Inkatha doesn't do well, if you fare  badly both nationally and on a regional level. How will you  feel about the election results then?    [Buthelezi] Well, as a democrat, you know, I must accept the  judgment of the people of South Africa. So as far as I am  concerned, as far as my party is concerned, as far as the  Central Committee, and my members, we are prepared to accept the  verdict of the people. But at the same time of course, I must  add that everyone knows that only an (?insane) politician like  myself would participate in the election, you know, seven days  before the election took place. But even that decision should  make you think about voting for me because I did that in the  interest of South Africa, because I thought that if in fact we  did not get the concerns of His Majesty the king addressed, and  therefore participation in the election, that this country was  going slide into an abyss, and this would have happened. So  even there I was concerned about the interest of everyone.    So I've been disadvantaged as a leader, and my party is  disadvantaged in that we haven't had time to campaign really  like all the other parties. But nevertheless, I could well say,  and some people would defend me, that you know, we were not  giving enough time to campaign, and that was not by accident,  because from the very beginning, the date was actually  manipulated, because the 27th was described as sacrosanct. I  don't know why it was sacrosanct. From the very beginning, you  know, people were actually pushed into accepting the 27th of  April as cast in granite, and I don't why it should be cast in  granite.    [Smythe] Well, you mentioned that you don't have very much  time to campaign, and that of course is a fact. But what is  also a fact is something I mentioned a little earlier, and the  fact that you actually have been at the center of South African  politics for the last few months, to some people in the negative  way, and to your supporters obviously in a very positive way.  So some people could say that was a rather cynical move on the  part of the Inkatha Freedom Party to stretch it out. Possibly  there have reports that maybe you felt that you weren't going to  be a tremendous success at the polls, that this was one way of  gaining concessions without having to go through all the  campaigning that the others parties have done, but have kept  your name in the forefront of the political field all this time?    [Buthelezi] I'll say that I had no script for that. To say  that it was drawn out deliberately as a strategy is wrong,  because it was the issues that were not addressed at Codesa  [Convention for a Democratic South Africa]. Codesa was not  destroyed by the IFP, it was the ANC and the South African  Communist Party alliance who destroyed Codesa. And in fact they  walked out of it, they threatened the whole country with mass  action, they tried to bring the country to a standstill, they  terrified Mr. de Klerk and forced him of course to sign the  Record of Understanding, which messed up the whole process of  negotiation.    So, we are not responsible for all those things, and I would  say therefore that there's nothing that we didn't do try and  bring about compromise or some understanding, because even after  our delegates withdrew from the forum, we then started  vigorously talking to -- on a bilateral basis with both the ANC  and the government. And then by December we were in a  trilateral situation with them discussing on a trilateral,  because we were desperate, because we wanted to get to the  electoral. We've never been against going to the electoral  process.    [Smythe] The way you're speaking, you see yourself as an  honest broker of your beliefs and the beliefs of your party and  for your king, but you're being described in some local press,  and indeed in some overseas press, as a demon, as a spoiler, and  in one as a public relations disaster. Do you feel a little bit  hard done by the press?    [Buthelezi] Well, I don't about that. That's a question of  opinion, because the largest newspaper -- THE SUNDAY TIMES -- I  think you must have seen that editorial on Easter, which  completely vindicated my stand, completely the opposite of Mr.  Ken Owen and his paper who have tried to demonize me, even  swearing at me, even defaming me in most cases. It is not true  that... [pauses].    From the beginning the things weren't wrong like th?s, I  mean  from the outset. The government and the ANC were supposed to be  people that must determine our future, so negotiations were made  by (Pollard) negotiations because the ANC and the government  were going to do it. In other words if I may use an analogy,  two cats in the room were enough. When I appeared as the third  cat somehow I took a knock by the media by other people  including diplomats as spoiling what could be a good thing if  the ANC and the government sow it up between themselves. But in  fact this is what caused the problem.    Now of course, then I had to be destroyed, then that's why  there was this campaign by both the government and the ANC and  national intelligence, who in fact did their damndest even to  incite the press, even when we discuss with Mr. de Klerk.    It's just unfortunate that he has got that man called Dr.  Barnard, who was the head of intelligence, because he is the man  really who has been responsible behind scenes for what has  happened. Because even some of the discussions between ourselves  when there was no media, for instance Skukuza, he gave them to  the press. For example, in Skukuza it was suggested that the  king should only go in with a few people. But then we had a  delegation which had legal advisers and so on, and he is the one  who was arguing with my official, Mr. Stan Armstrong. I mean,  that took place just between them, in the veranda, but the next  thing that was in the first page of THE SUNDAY TIMES. I mean  the water has been muddied by the fact that this man, Dr.  Barnard, has really been the power behind everything that has  gone wrong in this country.    [Smythe] Just continue with that kind of thought. You stood  for not making any deals with the present government until  Nelson Mandela was released, until the ANC was unbanned. So  there again do you feel that you've had rather the raw end of  the deal there, as far as the ANC and the NP were concerned?    [Buthelezi] I wish you were present at Skukuza, because when  the issue of the date came up, I said to Dr. Mandela, I said my  brother, I love you very much, which I do really, because to be  a friend with someone for more than 40 years is quite something.  So now I said to him, you know, I waited for years and years  for you. You mean you can't wait for me even for a few weeks?  Just for a few weeks? Can't you do that? I put this, you  know, it was nearly with tears in my eyes.    [Smythe] Well, between tears in your eyes and Mr. Mandela  saying he would go down on his knees, there was obviously a very  emotional decision that you had to make to actually go into  these elections. I wonder now what's going to happen.    [Buthelezi] His going on the knees was just really cheap  vilification really, because there was no need for him to use  the expression that he needs to go on his knees, because I've  never refused to see Mr. Mandela. Whenever meetings have been  requested I've never refused, I've never had any problems. And  in fact, it's strange you know, when we are together, you'll be  surprised at the affections that we've had for each other and  the warmth that we've had for each other, and comradeship in the  ANC surfaces. It comes to the top.    [Smythe] Does that mean after the elections when the results  are out, you're in Parliament, let's assume you get in, this  involvement there by the IFP for the IFP, you are going to be  able to work with a government of national unity?    [Buthelezi] Well, I don't know about that, but that's what  the constitution says, so therefore I suppose if one is in it,  one will have to abide by the constitution without necessarily  saying that I like that arrangement because I would prefer  myself to be in opposition politics. Or if I can't make it, if  the people do not elect me, because there are still a few days,  they can decide to elect me, I stand just as good a chance as  Mr. de Klerk or Mr. Mandela. But if they don't then I would  have liked to be in opposition politics.    [Smythe] So outside the parliamentary system, basically, you  would be happy to do that.    [Buthelezi] Yes, of course I would be happy to do that, in  fact, that's what [pauses] You know, a lot of people surprise  me, because they said to me what will you do if you don't go in  for elections? What will happen to you? And it amused me  because for 83 years black people have not been part and parcel  of the electoral process in this country. We've been out of it  and we have been in politics outside opposing apartheid,  opposing segregation, we were doing that outside. So that there  was nothing traumatic about being outside and actually opposing  the thing from outside.    [Smythe] There has been talk by some of the political  parties  of joining up and forming sort of coalitions, or whatever word  one wants to use, with other parties, either before or after the  election to gain strength in certain regions. How do you feel  about that as the IFP?    [Buthelezi] I don't think it's feasible as the constitution  stands to have coalitions as one had in the past. Maybe in  Parliament we can go on one side by arguing on the same side,  but to actually form coalitions I thought -- I'm subject to  correction here -- that the constitution does not make it  possible.    [Smythe] So you don't see yourself joining up? Supposing you  don't get elected into Parliament, you don't see yourself  joining up with the right wing to form some kind of guerrilla  outfit that you would form sort of Vietnam situation where you  go underground?    [Buthelezi] I would say in the first place, I rejected  violence long ago, and when I went to London in '79 to see Mr.  Oliver Thambo, it was precisely this issue on which we could not  agree because I could not agree to the armed struggle, because  I've always denounced violence, because the founding fathers of  ANC founded the ANC on the basis that the ANC was going to wage  a nonviolent struggle through negotiations. So when the ANC  decided, because of the intransigence of the government, to take  up arms, I disagreed with them. So therefore I'm not attracted  really by guerrilla warfare. Even when my people war waged  against the people who were oppressing us, the South African  apartheid regime, it was never an option I ever considered.    [Smythe] You are minister of police as well, Dr. Buthelezi.    [Buthelezi] Absolutely.    [Smythe] What is going to happen to the kwaZulu Police? I  mean, we have seen a lot of IFP supporters who are definitely  against, for example, the National Peacekeeping Force, seeing it  as an ANC-, an NP-dominated police force. What is going to  happen to the kwaZulu Police? Are you going to encourage them  to join a national police force?    [Buthelezi] Well, actually I suppose that is inevitable. I  mean, I think that the fact that you, I mean we are in (?an  election), makes it inevitable that they will be merged into a  national police force. But of course, as I said at (?the  rallies), I think that is absolutely wrong because the king  himself has stated, you know, that in his kingdom he would like  to have his own police force.    [Smythe] But that is not going to be annulled, is it? A  private, a sort of private police forces or private armies or....    [Buthelezi, interrupting] Well, it is not private. I mean,  America, they have got different police forces in various  states. They have even a militia. You know, the king wants a  militia as well because they have a militia in various states in  America, although you have got the national force, you know, on  the whole country. So, I mean it is a question of saying it is  not going to be allowed. It's neither here nor there because, I  mean, there are so many guns now in South Africa that it's  really, it's better to regularize this thing and do it properly.  In other countries like America do it. If you are going to  have a militia, even the states have the militia, if you are  going to have the police from the states, have that.    [Smythe] But you would encourage the kwaZulu Police as it  stands to participate in a national police force.    [Buthelezi] Yes. You know, as a matter of principle. When  I was approached by General Meiring and the commissioner of  police, General van der Merwe, when they came to Ulundi last  year and suggested that some of our police force should join the  National Peacekeeping Force, then I said that, well, I couldn't  because in the first place some of our people have been killed  by cadres of Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation -- ANC  military wing]. And there you are saying that we must merge  with them.    Because we saw something very strange in the state president  because on the 20th of December 1991 you will remember, even on  television, that he stated that he wanted Umkhonto we Sizwe  disbanded and that the arms should be (?handed) to the police.  But he had such a dressing down from Mr. Mandela that he never  opened his mouth about that later.    And the next thing we heard that there was going to be (?a  merger) into one force, into the National Peace Keeping Force  and also in the SADF [South African Defense Force]. Now, I am  very unhappy about that and I think I have been proven right  because the exchange of fire that took place at Thokoza just two  days ago, I mean bears testimony to that because it was not only  the IFP members who complained, but even some members of the ANC  were not happy with what happened there.    [Smythe] Dr. Buthelezi, what is it going to be like for you  to make your cross on the ballot paper for the first time?    [Buthelezi] Well, I think that it's an experience in fact  which will mean that at long last after a decade that one has  spent fighting for human rights for our people, fighting for the  franchise for our black people that at long last, you know, we  have reached that point.    [Smythe] And it will b a very emotional thing?    [Buthelezi] It will be a very emotional thing I think for  all  of us in the country as black people in particular to put that  cross on the ballot paper.    [Smythe] How are you going to manage? I mean, do you think  you actually can manage to campaign now over the next few days  nationally as well as regionally?    [Buthelezi] I am trying as much as possible, but if you  can't  clone yourself, I cannot clone myself and be everywhere where I  would like to be, but I mean tomorrow I am going to (?parts) of  the Transvaal and I think that those who are conducting our  campaign have scheduled me for Soweto on Sunday. But then the  days are finished. Then I can't do more than that. I would  like to do more than that, you know, but unfortunately as I say  I have not done that because I would like to go to the voters  myself and to speak for myself with the voters throughout the  country.    [Smythe] What do you see as the most pressing problem to  face  the new government?    [Buthelezi] I think the most pressing problem is meeting  the,  I mean, the unrealistic expectations that have been printed  because, I mean, the fact that we are going to have a government  of national unity, or even if it was a black government, will  not cause these things that we discussed at the beginning of  this interview -- the poverty -- we are not going to bridge  those gaps overnight. And therefore I fear myself, I am very  much scared, maybe it is not wise to be in a government of  national unity because one will just suffered that blame whether  one is responsible for it or not. I fear that the expectations  of young people that have been created, when they have been  promised that this means that they are going to have housing and  so, and all the things that have been promised.    (?These such things will not) [words indistinct] even if we  try. They will not have them overnight. I think Mr. Mandela  made this point -- was it yesterday -- as well as at King  William's Town that it will take five years or more. But I  believe myself it is a generation. I think we should prepare  our people that the real struggle is going to begin on the 28th.  The real struggle in this country commences after that. We  have got to roll up our sleeves and work, you know, all of us as  people of this country.    I don't think that we should, even if we have suffered  because of apartheid, that other people owe us a living. I  think that we should also have, you know, self-help schemes. I  have always believed in the IFP. There are twin pillars of our  philosophy -- self-help and self-reliance. I believe that even  if the economic growth will go higher, 5 percent or even more,  we will not be able to create the number of jobs, with the  democracy we have in the country, we are not going to be able to  give every young person that has catapulted into the labor  market with a [words indistinct] job.    So, therefore, it is a very uphill struggle. I think that if  we were more realistic in our approach by not, you know,  creating expectations that once we are also in charge in this  country that everything will vanish like mist. I think that it  would really pay dividends for us because then our people can be  sober and realize that the real struggle now is going to begin  on the 28th.    [Smythe] Dr. Buthelezi, thank you very much for joining us  on  Agenda tonight.    [Buthelezi] Thanks very much.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Geneva, 25 May (PL) -- Cuba today described as  unacceptable the link being sought here between the UN Security  Council and the Human Rights Commission, indicating that it is  up to the Rwandan people to find a solution to the dramatic  conflict.    The Cuban position was expressed by Ambassador Jose Perez  Novoa, who explained that his country will not break the  consensus for a special session on the Rwandan situation to  adopt a resolution whose concepts Cuba rejects.    For Cuba, it is extremely essential that there be a  cease-fire, a dialogue and negotiation among all the parties,  support for the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and its  member states, as well as the full application of the peace  agreements signed in Arusha, Tanzania, in 1993.    The Cuban Government, the diplomat stressed, believes that  the Rwandan people are the ones who must find a solution to this  dramatic and unfortunate conflict.    If the Rwandan parties do not decide to end the  confrontation  and seek a negotiated solution to their common problems and  differences, Perez Novoa said, we will be sad witnesses of the  continuation of hostilities, as has been occurring in other  conflicts addressed in special sessions by this same commission.    Without mentioning it, he referred to the situation of  former  Yugoslavia, which was discussed in two special sessions of the  Human Rights Commission in 1992.    In his opinion, the text that was presented created a new  dilemma for the participants: approving it to declare themselves  against extremely grave violations of human rights would mean  acceptance of the imposition of concepts that distort the  functions and mandates conferred by the UN Charter to its  various bodies.    This, he stressed, sets a totally negative precedent for the  functioning of the bodies of the UN system.    However, he added, by rejecting them, one would turn one's  back and remain silent about so dramatic a situation which  affects the rights and lives of thousands of human beings.    Without a doubt, we cannot refrain from expressing an  opinion  on the Rwandan events, but neither can we endorse concepts that  Cuba has systematically opposed and that some countries are  trying to impose by taking advantage of such serious situations,  the ambassador added.    He stated that the linkage that is being sought by the  Security Council is totally unacceptable, as is the inclusion of  concepts relative to preventive diplomacy and the eventual  establishment of an international tribunal, which in addition,  he said, is under discussion.    In tacit reference to the situation in the former  Yugoslavia,  he indicated that it is not a matter of using the same  prescription for different illnesses. Prescriptions which, in  addition, he said, have been unsuccessful in the cases in which  they have been applied. [sentence as received]    Considering the seriousness of the events in Rwanda and the  feelings of the African peoples, Cuba did not hinder the  approval of the resolution, even though it contained concepts  that Cuba believes to be unacceptable and which, if submitted to  a vote, it would have expressed opposition to.</p>

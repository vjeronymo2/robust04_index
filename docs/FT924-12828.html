			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / Management: From feudalism to federalism - The fashionable concept of the 'information-based organisation' is largely a fantasy Does your company suffer from anarchy, feudalism or utopianism in the way it deals with information? If so, you need to replace the offending regime with one which is better at managing the politics of information: either a monarchy or, best of all, a federation. You can determine your company's position on this spectrum quite easily. If small departments and even individuals run their own databases, and have a free hand in deciding what information they will give to whom, you have anarchy. If much larger business units or divisions hoard information and fail to communicate properly with each other, and even with head office, you are a victim of feudalism. If the company is riddled with blind faith in some technological paradise in which information flows around freely, you have utopianism. On the other hand, if information management is dictated by the chief executive, you are part of a monarchy. And if the nature and availability of information is negotiated between the various potentially warring parties, you are in the best state of all, a federation. This categorisation of 'information politics', plus advice on how to handle them, comes courtesy of three American business academics, Thomas Davenport, Robert Eccles and Laurence Prusack, in the autumn 1992 issue of Sloan Management Review, published by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The trio is thoroughly cynical about the impact that information technology has had - or failed to have - on companies over the past decade. The 'information-based organisation' may have been one of the most popular management concepts of the 1980s, yet the academics claim that today it is largely a fantasy. 'The rhetoric and technology of information management have far outpaced the ability of people to understand and agree on what information they need, and then to show it,' they add. Having studied the attempts of 25 companies to create entire information-based organisations, or even just to implement significant information management initiatives, the researchers conclude that many of their efforts have failed, or are on the path to failure. The primary reason for failure was that companies did not manage the politics of information. Either the initiative was inappropriate for the company's overall political culture, or politics were treated as peripheral, rather than integral to the initiative. Contrary to what many other academics have forecast, Davenport, Eccles and Prusack say that politics come increasingly into play as information and knowledge become more important to a company. 'In the most information-oriented companies we studied, people were least likely to share information freely . . . When information is the primary unit of organisational currency, we should not expect its owners to give it away.' Of the 25 companies studied, about half suffered from information feudalism, almost a third from utopianism, and a handful from anarchy. The positive approaches of monarchy and federalism were each practised by slightly fewer companies than was feudalism. Most practised more than one approach, either to hedge their bets, or because they had not yet converted fully to federalism. Explaining why federalism is generally more effective than monarchy, the academics say it recognises the importance of information politics, rather than trying to suppress them. IBM, the computer giant, has been trying to shift in this direction, although it is finding the complicated negotiation process extremely time consuming. Federalism is also more flexible than monarchy, say the academics, because it encourages both autonomy and co-ordination in the management of information, depending which is most appropriate for the particular requirements or circumstances of the situation. Among a series of tips on how to manage information politics within a federal approach, the academics say that the selection of the right 'information politicians' is vital. This role - not as the owner of information but as the manager with primary responsibility for facilitating its effective use - is still up for grabs in many companies, despite the widespread existence of people with titles such as 'chief information officer'. Until recently, most chief information officers were selected for technical acumen rather than political skills. But few embarked on initiatives to improve the way that information - not just information technology - is used and managed. Only a few information systems heads 'have the political clout to persuade powerful barons to share their information for the good of the entire kingdom', the academics report. The same applies to chief financial officers. At more far-sighted companies such as IBM, Xerox, Kodak and Merrill Lynch, recent corporate information heads have been fast-track executives with records of managing important non-technical aspects of the business. Such people have a better chance than most of identifying and managing the politics of information, the academics conclude. Until this is done, companies will not move into the 'information age', they say. 'No amount of data modelling, no number of relational databases, and no invocation of 'the information-based organisation' will bring about a new political order of information,' say Davenport, Eccles and Prusack. Rather, 'it will take what politics always take: negotiation, influence-exercising, backroom deals, coalition-building, and occasionally even war'.</p>

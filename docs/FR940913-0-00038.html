The current Lawton, OK, Class D airspace encompasses both the Lawton Municipal Airport, Lawton, OK, and Henry Post Army Airfield, Fort Sill, OK. The local aircraft operators requested and the FAA decided to divide the Lawton Class D airspace into two individual areas of Class D airspace; one area covering the Lawton Municipal Airport, Lawton, OK, and the other area covering Henry Post Army Airfield, Fort Sill, OK, as well as re-designate the former Lawton Class E airspace as Fort Sill, OK, Class E airspace. This action is intended to provide for more flexibility in airspace utilization and provide control over each individual area of airspace, particularly during times when the towers are non-operational. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> 0901 UTC, December 8, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Alvin DeVane, System Management Branch, Air Traffic Division, Southwest Region, Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration, Fort Worth, TX 76193&hyph;0530, telephone (817) 222&hyph;5595.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> History  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> On November 24, 1993, a proposal to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to modify the Class D airspace at Lawton, OK, was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (58 FR 62057). A request was made by local aircraft operators to divide the Lawton Class D airspace, Lawton, OK, into two separate areas of Class D airspace; one area covering the Lawton Municipal Airport, Lawton, OK, and one covering Henry Post Army Airfield (AAF), Fort Sill, OK. This proposed modification would allow for more flexibility in controlling each individual area of airspace to the extent deemed necessary, particularly during the times when the towers are non-operational.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Interested persons were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on the proposal to the FAA. No comments objecting to the proposal were received. The current Lawton Class D airspace has Class E extension's to the surface area. When Lawton Municipal Airport and Henry Post AAF were designated as separate Class D airspace areas, it became necessary to re-designate the Class E extension's to the previous Lawton Class D airspace area as Class E extension's to the Fort Sill Class D airspace because of their locations. The original proposal failed to address this situation. Therefore, this action corrects that oversight by revoking the Class E extension's to the Lawton Class D airspace. The Class E airspace extension's that have been revoked by this action have been re-instated in the rulemaking action that establishes the Class D airspace for Henry Post Army Airfield, Fort Sill OK. Except for this change, the amendment is the same as that proposed in the notice. The FAA has determined that this change will not increase the scope of this rule because it is relieving, i.e. it revokes previous Class E airspace making it less restrictive.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class D and Class E airspace designations are published respectively in paragraphs 5000 and 6004 of FAA Order 7400.9B dated July 18, 1994, and effective September 16, 1994, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1. The Class D and Class E airspace designations listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> The Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) modifies the Class D airspace at Lawton, OK, to separate the Lawton Class D airspace into two separate Class D airspace; one area covering the Lawton Municipal Airport, Lawton, OK, and one covering Henry Post Army Airfield, Fort Sill, OK. This action also revokes the Class E extension's to the previous Lawton, OK, Class D airspace so it can be redesignated as Fort Sill, OK, Class E airspace.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations that need frequent and routine amendments to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 71 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Aviation safety, Incorporation by reference, Navigation (air).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Adoption of the Amendment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In consideration of the foregoing, the Federal Aviation Administration amends 14 CFR part 71 as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 71_[AMENDED] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

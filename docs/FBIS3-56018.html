			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Moscow, Jan. 12 (YONHAP) -- A foreign press report  Wednesday [12 January] that Russia has signed a contract to sell  four fox-trot class submarines to North Korea is "nearly  accurate," a Western military source said.    The TOKYO SHIMBUN reported that North Korea had signed a  contract with the Russian Far East-Pacific fleet headquarters to  buy four fox-trot submarines in the Vladivostok naval yard.    The source said that a North Korean naval delegation visited  the naval headquarters in Vladivostok last September. Another  North Korean high-level naval delegation secretly visited Moscow  in November, apparently in connection with the submarine  purchase.    The source said he believes that the Russian Far  East-Pacific  fleet has recommended sale of the submarines to naval  headquarters in Moscow.    The fox-trot class submarine is generally classified as an  attack vessel and therefore, if Russia proceeds with the sale,  Moscow will be reneging on its promise to South Korea that it  would not offer any offensive weapons to North Korea, the source  said.    President Boris Yeltsin, during his visit to South Korea in  December 1992, had affirmed that Russia would never supply  offensive weapons to North Korea.    North Korea was understood to have explained to Russia that  it planned to buy the submarines and disassemble them to use  scrap iron. But since the submarines are still in usuable  shape, the North Korean explanation is unconvincing, the source  said.    The price of the submarines and other conditions of the  sales  contract are being kept secret, he said.</p>

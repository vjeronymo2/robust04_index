			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Grow, grow, grow your boat: The rise of size in the international cruise market Bob Dickinson, marketing director at Miami's Carnival Cruise Lines, recently made a promotional video. To demonstrate on-board facilities, Carnival filmed an employee strolling through a cruise liner's atrium - it was seven storeys high. The story illustrates the extent to which size dominates today's cruise-line industry. Carnival vessels, with names like Fantasy and Ecstasy, are essentially giant floating hotels, capable of housing 2,000 or more passengers. The surrounding ocean is almost incidental. Only this week, Carnival - the world's largest cruise-line operator in terms of passengers carried - ordered a 95,000-ton ship from an Italian yard, at a cost of more than Dollars 400m (Pounds 263m). The vessel, which could be in service within four years, will have 1,300 berths and sleep up to 4,400 people. In terms of gross tonnage, it will be 25 per cent bigger than any cruise ship ploughing the seas at present (the QE2, by comparison, is 67,000 tons). But it is not just the ships that are changing. The notion that cruises are genteel holidays for the wealthy, full of Cowardesque figures sipping dry Martinis, has been interred. Today's cruise-line customer is more likely to be under 50, with an annual income of less than Dollars 50,000. He or she is probably a sun-seeker, headed for the Caribbean, who will spend fewer than seven days on board. At first glance, these changes seem to have enabled the cruise-line business to navigate the recession in better shape than most of the leisure industry. Since the 1990s began, airlines and hotels have faced shrinking demand and severe financ-ial pressures. In North America, easily the largest cruise market in the world, the New York-based Cruise Lines International Association estimates that 4.4m people took cruises last year. That was an increase on 1991 of 10 per cent - which is also the average annual growth rate registered over the past decade. Occupancy rates for North American cruise operators averaged 85-90 per cent last year; US airlines struggle to achieve figures in the high 60s. But beneath the surface, prospects are murkier. While demand increased, about one dozen new ships also came into operation in 1992, adding about 11,000 berths and increasing total capacity by about 12.5 per cent. This year, another five liners - including Carnival's giant Sensation, which is more than 850 feet long and capable of carrying 2,600 passengers - will also hit the high seas. The industry's optimists, like Mr Dickinson, think that demand will grow to match the capacity expansion. They point out that, even in recessionary times, cruise holidays have appeal. The cost of such holidays is fixed at the outset, because the fare includes meals and entertainment. By adding in all the extra expenses attached to a conventional, land-based vacation, it may be cheaper to buy a cruise-line package than to stay at a hotel. Others in the travel industry are less sanguine. Travel agents, for example, note that heavy discounting of published cruise-line fares has been prevalent for several years and shows no signs of letting up. 'Published prices mean absolutely nothing,' says one Manhattan-based travel agent. 'Every time you turn around, someone's bringing on a new ship - there's so much overcapacity at present.' High occupancy rates are achieved only through discounting: current offers, he says, include 'two tickets for the price of one' and cuts of 30 or 40 per cent off brochure prices. While it is true that Carnival has posted steady annual profit advances, half a dozen smaller companies are believed to have faced serious financial problems. A handful of companies, such as the Seattle-based Exploration Cruise Lines, have filed for bankruptcy protection. Nevertheless, Cruise-ship owners claim that their 'untapped' market is huge. CLIA, for example, cites market research showing that 60 per cent of North American adults 'dream of taking a cruise', while only between 5 and 7 per cent of the population has done so. The non-American market also presents a large potential source of new customers. In the UK, the world's second biggest market, the Passenger Shipping Association estimates that about 200,000 people went on cruises last year. A flight to Florida, followed by a Caribbean cruise, was the most popular option. While the number of UK residents taking cruises has more than doubled since the mid-1980s, it is still tiny compared with the 11m who take air-based package holidays abroad. In Germany, the next biggest market, the PSA estimates the number of cruise passengers is only about 175,000. Although cruises are attracting younger UK customers, the industry concedes it still has work to do. Mr Richard Bowden-Doyle, marketing director of Lunn Poly, the UK's biggest travel agent chain, says: 'The UK is a potentially lucrative market, but historically the British have seen cruising as a holiday for the blue-rinse brigade.' He argues that is changing. Although recent UK-wide Lunn Poly presentations on cruising failed to attract people in their 20s, potential customers in their 30s did turn up. Bigger ships are central to the industry's attempt to extend the appeal of cruising. Operationallly, large ships offer some basic economies of scale. Senior crew numbers, for example, do not increase proportionately with a ship's size. Nor do promotional expenses. But the main advantage comes on the marketing front. Many people still think of a cruise as too stuffy, Dickinson admits. 'They expect a string quartet at four o'clock and a lecture on geranium-planting in the evening.' The new jumbo ships quickly dispel this impression. They are marketed as 'fun ships', with casinos, spas, jogging tracks, even golf facilities. Cruise companies allow passengers to keep up with their favourite sports events. Norwegian Cruise Line and Royal Viking introduced big-screen showings of sports events last autumn, covering top league baseball and basketball games. In answer to suggestions that travellers could grow weary of being confined in the company of several thousand other holidaymakers, Dickinson says defensively: 'There are hotels with 2,000 rooms in Vegas.' The Cassandras are not convinced. Gerald Celente, director of the Trends Research Institute in New York state, sees similarities with the US hotel industry, which overbuilt in the 1980s now lives with the burdens of oversupply. Does he not buy the argument that demand is just waiting to be tapped? 'The huge potential market,' he says, 'has to have the money to spend. Look at the recent Christmas shopping . . . those people are simply going into debt again. They just don't have the discretionary income.' If he is right, cruise companies could find themselves becalmed.  ------------------------------------------------------                   ANNUAL GROWTH IN                NORTH AMERICAN CRUISE                MARKET, 1980-90 ('000)  ------------------------------------------------------                      Passengers            % change  ------------------------------------------------------ 1980                   1,431                 13.5 1981                   1,455                  1.7 1982                   1,472                  1.2 1983                   1,696                 15.2 1984                   1,859                  9.6 1985                   2,152                 15.8 1986                   2,624                 21.9 1987                   2,875                  9.6 1988                   3,175                 10.4 1989                   3,286                  3.5 1990                   3,640                 10.8  ------------------------------------------------------ Average annual growth 1980-90: 9.8 per cent Source: Cruise Lines International Association  ------------------------------------------------------</p>

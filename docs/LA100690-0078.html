			<p><P> October 6, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> YAROSLAVSKY TO SEEK 2-STORY HEIGHT LIMIT IN SHERMAN OAKS  </P> <P> Los Angeles City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky will seek to bar new construction  from exceeding two stories in height along an eight-block stretch of Ventura  Boulevard in Sherman Oaks, his office announced Friday.  </P> <P> "I think it goes against the character of Sherman Oaks to have construction of  buildings any higher than two stories," Yaroslavsky said in a press release.  </P> <P> The proposal would impose a two-story or 30-foot height restriction on Ventura  Boulevard from Columbus Avenue to Beverly Glen Boulevard.  </P> <P> Vivian Roscalvo, a Yaroslavsky planning aide, said the proposed ordinance  probably would not take effect for another six months and would eventually  amend the Ventura Boulevard Specific Plan, which is still under consideration  by the council.  </P> <P> Despite the delay, "no projects are in the pipeline that pose a threat" to the  status quo of this area in Sherman Oaks, Roscalvo said.  </P> <P> The Ventura Boulevard Specific Plan, which will be reviewed Tuesday by the  council's Planning and Land Use Management Committee, calls for a three-story  or 45-foot height limit between Columbus and Beverly Glen.  </P> <P> "The area between Columbus and Beverly Glen is as pedestrian-oriented as the  other areas included in the Specific Plan," where the buildings "are one or two  stories," Yaroslavsky said.  </P> <P> Roscalvo said the proposal would not interfere with the council's consideration  of the Specific Plan. "It will move forward on a separate track," she said.  </P></p>

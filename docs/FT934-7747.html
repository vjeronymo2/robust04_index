			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of South Africa - Open for investment (6): From civil war to consensus - Policy WHEN Derek Keys took over as South Africa's finance minister in May 1992, one of his key priorities was stopping the economic 'civil war'. It is a measure of the progress made towards achieving consensus on economic policy that he can now pronounce this 'done'. Certainly there will continue to be disputes between the main political players, business and labour. The past two months have offered ample examples: the issue of cellular telephone licences, a rise in the petrol price, trade union rights under a future constitution - all these elicited threats from the ANC and its trade union ally Cosatu (the Congress of South African Trade Unions) ranging from mass action and a national strike, to nationalisation. In the event, deals were struck and disruption avoided. This represents enormous progress. In the past economic disputes often ended in mass action and conflict. Now they are managed, and a satisfactory resolution is normally achieved. It is a fair guess that this spirit of compromise will inform South Africa's economic policy under a new government. Mr Keys comments: ''There is always a way' - for this job, that is my motto.' If praise is due, then Mr Keys stands at the front of the queue. More than any other factor, his skills as manager and deal-maker, coupled with an engaging personality and intellectual authority, account for this change. Considerable assistance, however, has also come from other quarters. Most obviously, the National Economic Forum (NEF), the tripartite body where business, government and labour seek agreement on economic policy, has performed a critical role. The ANC has also played its part with Mr Trevor Manuel, head of the Department of Economics and Planning, spearheading a more flexible and considered approach to economic policy. The results are impressive. Recent months have seen South Africa make significant economic commitments, all of which enjoyed multi-party support. These include signing a final debt rescheduling deal, which runs for eight years; agreeing the terms of an Dollars 850m loan from the IMF; agreeing the terms of a revised offer to GATT, whereby South Africa's tariff book will be substantially simplified and the average tariff lowered; and agreeing the terms of future relations with the World Bank. To ensure that South Africa's commitments in these areas enjoyed the necessary political legitimacy, Mr Keys established an ad hoc committee, the Economic Technical Committee (ETC), on which government, the ANC, PAC and Inkatha were represented. In all four of the above cases, the ETC agreed the final terms. Tensions still exist between - roughly - the ANC/Cosatu on one side, and government/business on the other but the crucial differences are the way in which these issues are handled. The latter is testimony to considerable policy movement from the ANC in particular. Certainly, the organisation and some of its leaders have not totally shaken off their socialist vision. Both Mr Mandela and Mr Ramaphosa, ANC secretary-general, have let the dreaded nationalisation word slip in the past two months. But, as one commentator noted: 'The movement is clear, if not always convincing - but it's not a trick.' Currently, the ANC is best characterised as being a reluctant convert to market economics. If it has left behind the days in which it was firmly committed to nationalising the mines, banks and 'commanding heights' of the economy, it still retains a touching faith in the state as a powerful agent to do economic good. It remains as sceptical as ever, however, of Adam Smith's invisible hand. The search is on, therefore, for some sort of 'third way', with countries such as Germany and Sweden, notwithstanding their respective difficulties, cited admiringly. Although some ANC spokesman have started increasingly to say 'the right thing' - justifying, for example, their commitment to a vigorous anti-trust policy in terms of the need to promote the efficiency of markets - some doubts remain. Thus, while Mr Mandela has taken to vigorously beating the foreign investment drum since calling for the lifting of economic sanctions in September, he still continues to 'invite' investors to come to South Africa to 'help', as if that were their main concern. Domestically, the economic focus of an ANC government will be on a programme of 'national reconstruction', with the aim being to visibly uplift the lot of its followers. This will basically be a case of 'more of the same' since the past three budgets have already had a heavy emphasis on redistribution, with essentially the same purposes in mind. While this envisages a heavy role for the state in areas such as publics works programmes, this should take place within reasonable fiscal limits. Not only is the ANC on record as saying macroeconomic balance must be maintained, but it has also acknowledged that South Africa is already highly taxed. It is committed, in terms of the IMF loan letter of intent, to limiting the budget deficit (6 per cent of GDP is the target in 1994/5). There is also little evidence that a new government will interfere with monetary policy, though business is likely to lobby for some let-up in pressure. Of privatisation, little is likely to be heard. While commercialisation of state corporations - notably Posts and Telecommunications and Transnet - is under way, the ANC remains set against the concept. Mr Keys's judgment is that 'the final step to privatisation will require substantial disappointment with other routes first'. A much more difficult longer term question facing a new government will be the restructuring of trade and industrial policy. Sanctions, and efforts to combat them, have left some areas of the economy uncompetitive in the international market. Mr Eugene van As, executive chairman of pulp and paper group Sappi, cites the example of the truck that draws up to his factory gate: it probably costs 100 per cent more than the price his international competitors pay, the tyres are probably 30 per cent more expensive and the spares double the cost. He adds that if he were able to buy five chemicals at the price his US competitors pay for the same products, he would virtually double Sappi's earnings. Ironing out these distortions in the economy will take wisdom, time and sacrifice. How much is available is unclear. While Gatt has said it understands South Africa needs time to address these problems, this has not stopped it rejecting what it regards as excessive tariff protection for South Africa's beleaguered clothing and textiles sector (proposals of 60 per cent for clothing and 45 per cent for household textiles under the latest Gatt offer). In terms of its other international economic relations, a future government is likely to take a fairly robust stance. The ANC/Cosatu, for example, has made clear that it has no taste for a supplicant relationship with the IMF and World Bank, with economic policy decided in Washington. Current economic policies are broadly consonant with IMF norms, and no World Bank finance is expected much before the end of 1994. Funds for development are available locally; the priority now is to work out how these should be spent. Only later will the need for Bank finance emerge. The other two important relationships will be with the European Union (EU) and neighbours in the region. The former is important because South Africa does not belong to any economic grouping, and the EU is its largest trade partner. It looks unlikely that South Africa will accede to the Lome convention, which offers concessionary trade terms. More likely will be some sort of bilateral framework agreement which can be negotiated much more quickly, while also offering substantial market access benefits. As to the region, a new government will probably want to join the Southern African Development Community (SADC), if only to show solidarity with many of its allies in the frontline states. Present indications are, however, that co-operation is likely to focus initially on functional issues such as power and transport with more grandiose visions of economic integrations lying some way further in the distance.</p>

			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / Halifax records blip in house prices House prices fell 0.4 per cent last month compared with December, emphasising the fragility of the housing market recovery, Halifax, Britain's biggest mortgage lender, said yesterday. The building society said tax increases announced in the November Budget may have weakened confidence in the housing market, which had been recovering. The latest decline follows a 0.6 per cent fall reported for December. Nationwide, Britain's second largest building society, on Tuesday produced figures showing that prices rose on average by 0.4 per cent in January. Mr Gary Marsh, head of research at Halifax, said he was slightly surprised by the fall in prices which came when it was thought that the market had stabilised. December and January were normally very weak months. 'We will be looking at the next two or three months with some interest,' said Mr Marsh. Halifax, which had warned that occasional monthly price falls would occur, believed nevertheless that the housing market recovery would continue. It said: 'Despite this pronounced seasonal weakness in house prices, overall activity in the market, as reported by the Inland Revenue, continues to show signs of picking up. We remain confident that as more general signs of economic recovery become more apparent, then house prices will resume their gradual upward course.' Halifax and Nationwide both expect prices to rise by about 5 per cent on average this year. Some of the monthly discrepancies between the societies' figures may be explained by the fact that Nationwide uses a smaller sample of borrowers, while Halifax seasonally adjusts its figures. According to Halifax the average price of a home in the UK rose by 1.1 per cent to Pounds 61,133 during the 12 months to the end of January. Nationwide reported a 2.4 per cent rise to Pounds 53,763 for the same period. Halifax said that the price of new homes, after falling in December, increased by 0.8 per cent in January, resulting in a rise of 0.3 per cent over the preceding 12 months. Instead of raising prices, builders have been eroding some of the sales incentives such as subsidised loans and moving expenses which had been offered during the recession, and which helped reduce profit margins.</p>

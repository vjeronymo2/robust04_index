			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / International Company News: Matif president happy to follow his own rules - Gerard Pfauwadel can see his legislation at work in the French futures market Mr Gerard Pfauwadel, president of Matif, the French futures and options market, is in a potentially awkward position when it comes to assessing the legislation that frames his work - he is the man who wrote the rules. Like many of his contemporaries, Pfauwadel has moved easily from the public to the private sector. However, unlike most of his fellow graduates of ENA, the elite French public administration college, he is now bound directly by the laws he drafted. He can recall when the legislation was passed: 'I remember it precisely  - July 13 1985.' He was then under-deputy secretary at the French Treasury. And now that he can see the legislation in practice, would he change anything? 'Not really,' he says bluntly. 'If it's not broken, don't fix it. It's clear the Matif is not broken. Why do we need to change something that is working extremely well?' He points out that France will have to make a few modifications to its laws to align them with the requirements for free competition, under the European investment directive, by the start of 1996. 'Little needs to be changed. Our taxation system is good; our membership is adapted; we are not a closed shop,' he says. Mr Pfauwadel argues that civil servants were among those most closely involved in and enthusiastic about creating a deregulated market for the French 'big bang' in the late 1980s. 'There would have been no growth in the market unless we were sure that the environment was adequate, with sensible taxation for profits and losses, for example,' he says. 'We had another target in building the market,' he says. 'We wanted to modernise the financing of the Treasury. The deficits were starting to be huge and it was important to open the way for investors so it would be possible for the Treasury to issue more bonds. Public debt was almost exploding.' Matif was founded in 1986, using a structure distinctly different from its Anglo-Saxon counterparts. It is not an institutional exchange owned by its members, but rather a corporate entity. Mr Pfauwadel says: 'We were relatively late starting. The best way to accelerate growth was the entrepreneurial rather than the Anglo-Saxon co-operative approach.' He argues that one reason for the rapid development of Matif has been the French education system. 'We have the savoir-faire. People in France are very well trained in mathematics, which is essential for options. It is clear that the level of abstraction is pretty high.' In contrast, he says, London has focused more on futures, which he argues are 'less complex' products with which to grapple. Mr Pfauwadel says the creation of Matif was the first time that banks and brokers - traditional competitors - had agreed to join forces. They took a third of the shares each, with the remainder going to insurance companies as 'arbitrators'. The Matif has proved very profitable, generating a surplus which helps guarantee all contracts written and fund new investment. Inevitably, there have been calls for a broader ownership for the market. This, he concedes, has come from brokers 'who were not sufficiently involved in the equity at the time of the original discussions'. 'It is a very fine-tuned balance. We need to keep a third of the shares with each of the three groups. We may have some evolution. But it needs to work well in the interests of everybody.' If Mr Pfauwadel sounds at times a little defensive, it is not because he is opposed to change. 'Pragmatic' is a word that springs up often in his vocabulary. Last month, Matif opened a market for its latest product: rapeseed futures contracts. 'It is becoming more and more difficult to innovate,' he says. He believes that most currency instruments for which there is a demand are already in place. One result has been to focus on commodities - notably in agricultural products. 'We are an agricultural country,' he says. 'Prices have been completely obscured by the Common Agricultural Policy, not determined by the market but by technocrats in Brussels. We need a market game (to develop futures).' Rapeseed has now been introduced; wheat and others may follow. Equally, Mr Pfauwadel says he is far from settled on the 'open outcry' trading system, so fundamental to the exchange's current operations. 'If we cannot innovate though products, another way is to give our members access to other products in other markets,' he says. This explains Matif's use of the Globex system linking it with other exchanges worldwide, and its recent hook-up with the Deutsche Terminborse, its Frankfurt equivalent. He said he believed that if the Franco-German platform were successful, it would attract other continental markets. 'The Dutch, Spaniards and Swiss have already expressed interest,' he says. The British, by contrast, have taken another approach. Matif approached Liffe before Frankfurt to suggest a trading link, but it refused. 'It wants a big market in the City (of London) to quote all European products,' says Mr Pfauwadel. 'That is in conflict with our strategy to develop a domestic niche and link it to other centres. They are two distinct strategies. I have no idea which will win.'</p>

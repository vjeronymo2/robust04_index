			<p><P> April 4, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AGREEMENT REACHED ON MOVING SALCIDO TRIAL  </P> <P> A Superior Court judge said Tuesday that both sides in the Ramon Salcido mass  murder case have tentatively agreed on moving his trial to Contra Costa, San  Joaquin or San Mateo counties.  </P> <P> Salcido is charged with the murders last April of his wife, Angela, 24;  daughters, Sofia, 4, and Teresa, 1; his mother-in-law, Marion Richards, 47;  Richards' daughters, Ruth, 12, and Marie, 8; and his boss, Tracy Toovey, 35.  </P> <P> He also is charged with attempting to kill another daughter, Carmina, 3, and  fellow winery worker Ken Butti, 33.  </P> <P> Public Defender Marteen Miller has successfully argued that intense publicity  surrounding the case would make it impossible for Salcido, 38, to get a fair  trial in Sonoma County.  </P></p>

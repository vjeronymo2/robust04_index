			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: Compiled by </F> Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy, edited by Vladimir  Shishlin]    [Text] President Geydar Aliyev who continued Monday an  inspection trip to the zone of the Karabakh conflict, said  meeting with the commanders of the republic's armed forces, that  he was sure that Azerbaijan was able to defend itself with its  own forces, without relying on the assistance from the outside.    The president said he was interested in the "peaceful  outcome  of the war, unleashed by Armenia". He said that "the liberation  of the occupied lands is the sacred duty for each soldier". IF  Note: The visit by Geydar Aliyev to the frontline zone started  last Sunday. According to a spokesman for the defense army of  Nagorno-Karabakh the day was marked by the intensification of  the offensive by the Azeri Army in the zone of conflict. The  spokesman said that Azeri air raids against the capital of the  self-proclaimed republic, Stepanakert, three persons were killed  and nine wounded [sentence as received]. A source in the Azeri  Defense Ministry said that yesterday Armenian units attempted to  attack at the southern part of the front in the Fizuli and  Beilagan areas of Azerbaijan. Reports from Baku say that the  offensive was stopped and the Armenians retreated to the initial  positions.    Baku observers say that Aliyev's schedule indicates that the  Azeri leadership does not stake exclusively on the military  solution of the problem. It is expected the subject of the  political settlement of conflicts in the region will be one of  the central ones during the visit of the Azeri leader to Tbilisi  scheduled for Tuesday.    The agenda of the talks between Aliyev and Eduard  Shevardnadze is expected to include the forthcoming Moscow  summit of the CIS leaders on April 15. It is likely that in  discussing the problem of a regional safety different versions  of the implementation of the CIS collective security treaty may  be under discussion. Earlier, Aliyev spoke much about the  document's inefficiency within the context of the continuing  hostilities in the zone of the Karabakh conflict which provided  grounds for speculation on the republic's possible withdrawal  from the CIS.    A reliable source in the president's administration called  those suppositions groundless. He said that Baku intended  shortly to urge that the CIS mechanism for curbing external and  internal aggressors be put into action.</p>

			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / US-EU early warning system: 'Quiet dialogue' machinery to be put in place to tackle trade disputes Senior US and European Commission officials yesterday agreed to set up an 'early warning system' to identify and tackle potential transatlantic trade disputes. The first issue to be tackled is an increasing US tendency to set conditions on the application of national treatment, Brussels officials said. This could lead to discrimination against European companies investing in the US in areas such as research and development, they said. The talks in Brussels were the first effort to meet President Clinton's pledge on his recent trip to Europe to intensify EU-US co-operation. Both sides described the talks as productive. The two sides also discussed the post-Uruguay Round trade agenda, with the US again stating its interest in including workers' rights and environment policy. A senior US official said it was important to develop a 'quiet dialogue' to tackle disputes on audio-visual and public procurement which were not resolved in last December's Gatt agreement. Commission officials welcomed the change in tone, but made clear they had no new offer to make on the audio-visual issue. It was better for the US and European industries to pursue the matter, one said. The sub-cabinet level talks also agreed to intensify regulatory co-operation. A list of possible areas for future discussion includes mobile satellite phones, pesticides, and environmental waste packaging. A further area for co-operation includes exchange of views on new continent-wide information technology programmes being developed in the US and Europe such as the administration's National Information Infrastructure programme. 'We want to ensure they do not run counter to each other,' said one Brussels official.</p>

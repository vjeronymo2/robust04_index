			<p><P> December 19, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> MAIL MADNESS: Things are almost out of control these days at the General Post  Office in Santa Ana, which handled about 3 million pieces of mail Monday (B3).  . . . With all that, you still have a chance to get a timely Christmas card to  the relatives out of state, if you hurry. . . . Officials say that all cards --  especially those bound for the snowbound East and Midwest -- should be mailed  no later than today. Dana Parsons and Mark I. Pinsky  </P></p>

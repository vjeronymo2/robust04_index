			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksandr Kopnov] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 22 TASS -- The issue of introduction of  U.N. economic sanctions against North Korea due to its suspected  development of nuclear arms is not on today's agenda, head of  the Korean division of the Russian Foreign Ministry's First  Asian Department Valentin Moiseyev told ITAR-TASS here today.    In his words, the Russian Foreign Ministry proceeds from the  fact diplomatic methods have not been exhausted. This stand is  shared by other interested nations, including China, said  Moiseyev.    The official reminded of the Russian proposal to convene a  multilateral conference on security and non-nuclear status of  the Korean peninsula, which, in his words, "has been positively  estimated by all potential participants in the conference with  the exception of North Korea". The potential participants  include the Russian federation, the United States, China, Japan,  North Korea, South Korea, as well as representatives of the  United Nations and the International Atomic Energy Agency.    At the same time, Moscow is using all political methods to  influence Pyongyang and has informed North Korea of its stand,  said Moiseyev. For instance, Moscow has invited the deputy  North Korean foreign minister to visit Russia in early summer  within the framework of bilateral diplomatic contacts. But all  Russian diplomatic efforts "cannot have a force nature or  pressure form," stressed the official.    If the question of sanctions or russian participation in  them  is raised, "one will have to take into account feasible  consequences of this step not only for North Korea but also for  Russia," said Moiseyev.    The Russian-North Korean goods turnover amounted to 530  million U.S. dollars in 1993, which is 25-30 per cent of the  North Korean foreign trade turnover. Russia exported 450  millions worth of goods to North Korea and purchased 80 millions  worth of products there. The problem of the North Korean debt to  the former Soviet Union and Russia, which is estimated at  approximately three billion dollars, remains unsettled.</p>

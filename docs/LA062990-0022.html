			<p><P> June 29, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'SHIFTING GEARS' ON BICYCLES, MOTORCYCLES  </P> <P> Congratulations on the great article regarding the trend toward alternate  transportation methods as a way of beating traffic ("Shifting Gears," June 19).  It was nice to see coverage of a growing change in commuter attitude,  especially when we in Southern California are faced with a serious and growing  crisis in transportation.  </P> <P> My own personal experience with alternative transportation began last summer  when my car broke down. I began riding my bike from my home in Pacific Beach to  my job tending bar in La Jolla, five miles each way. Even after I got my car  repaired, I continued to ride my bike to work simply because I enjoyed it.  </P> <P> This summer, I am riding my bike to my job at Caltrans in Old Town, another  five-mile ride each way. The ride past Mission Bay at 7:30 in the morning is  beautiful and an important start to my day.  </P> <P> When school begins this fall, I plan on riding to the campus, 15 miles from  home. Sure it takes a little longer, but the workout alone is worth it.  Besides, driving to San Diego State to study for a master's degree in  conservation of environmental quality does not make sense.  </P> <P> JOSEPH R. TRNKA  </P> <P> Pacific Beach  </P></p>

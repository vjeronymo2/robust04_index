			<p><P> August 26, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH ORDERS AGENCIES TO TRIM SPENDING PLANS  </P> <P> The White House on Saturday ordered the government to prepare for drastic  program cutbacks beginning Oct. 15 in the event that efforts to reach a budget  compromise fail.  </P> <P> In an order issued at President Bush's vacation home here, the President told  all federal agencies to sharply cut back on their spending beginning Oct. 1,  pending further notice.  </P> <P> Administration and congressional leaders are seeking to assemble a package of  roughly $50 billion in deficit-reduction measures, including both spending cuts  and new tax revenues.  </P> <P> But progress has come slowly. While Republicans privately offered a plan  earlier this month, the Democrats have yet to make a counterproposal.  </P> <P> Under the Gramm-Rudman balanced-budget law, a failure to reach an agreement by  Oct. 1 will trigger across-the-board cuts in most federal programs totaling  more than $100 billion. These would take effect Oct. 15.  </P> <P> Budget negotiators have set a self-imposed Sept. 10 deadline for reaching a  compromise, and they plan to meet Sept. 6-7 at Andrews Air Force Base in  Maryland to get down to work.  </P> <P> Once an agreement between congressional leaders and the White House is  concluded, it must then be approved by both the House and Senate and signed  into law by the President.  </P> <P> If an agreement is not reached by Sept. 7, the negotiators have said they  probably will work through the weekend in an effort to settle remaining  differences.  </P> <P> Under the presidential order issued Saturday, which was labeled an "initial  order," beginning Oct. 1 all agencies would have to trim their actual spending  enough to achieve more than $100 billion in savings government-wide over the  next 12 months.  </P> <P> No new spending commitments, direct loans or loan guarantees could be made, and  loans already approved would have to be scaled back.  </P></p>

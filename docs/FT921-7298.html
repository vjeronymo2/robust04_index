			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / International Company News: BSN enters Perrier fray with FFr6bn bid for Exor BSN, the French food group, yesterday raised the temperature in the fight for Perrier mineral water by launching a FFr6bn (Dollars 1.07bn) counter-bid for Exor, the French property company that controls Perrier, against the Agnelli family. The BSN bid marks a new phase in the Perrier affaire, which has turned into a bitter battle since Nestle, the Swiss food group, last month mounted a FFr13.42bn hostile bid for Perrier with Indosuez, the powerful Parisian bank. BSN has secured the support of both Nestle, one of its chief competitors in the European food market, and Indosuez in the bid for Exor, which controls 35 per cent of Perrier. The French food group is also being assisted by Lazard, another prominent Paris bank and BSN's biggest single shareholder. It had, until recently, been seen as an ally of the Agnellis. The BSN camp is offering FFr1,420 for each Exor share, valuing the company at just over FFr6bn. This pitches its bid above the FFr1,320 offered by Ifint, an Agnelli vehicle, late last year. The Italian family speaks for 54 per cent of Exor, however, and last night, Ifint said it would not accept the BSN bid. The announcement of the BSN bid, after the Paris stock market had closed, followed a day of frantic speculation. Early yesterday the French stock market authorities issued a statement suspending Exor's shares pending the announcement of an 'imminent counter-bid'. BSN was immediately mooted as a likely candidate. It is an established partner of the Agnellis, with whom it has several joint ventures. However, it appeared to switch allegiance in the Perrier bid by agreeing to buy Volvic, a Perrier still water business, from Nestle, thereby reducing the risk of monopoly problems if the latter's bid succeeded. Yesterday there was speculation in the French press that BSN had been trying to engineer a rapprochement between Nestle and the Agnellis, possibly by counter-bidding for Exor. Exor's chairman, Mr Jacques Vincent, who also heads Perrier, has led the fight against Nestle and Indosuez. 'BSN is in a difficult position,' said Mr John Graham, European food analyst at UBS:Phillips &amp; Drew in London. 'The Perrier battle has become very messy. BSN is helping Nestle by buying Volvic, but it will also want to protect its joint ventures with the Agnellis.' Meanwhile, the legal battle over Perrier should come to a head next week when the French commercial courts conclude two critical cases. Also next week, Exor and its allies - Societe Generale, the French bank, and Saint Louis, the sugar company - will discover whether they will be forced to comply with a recent French stock market ruling to make a full bid for Perrier.</p>

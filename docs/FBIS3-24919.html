			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by President Henri Konan Bedie; place and </F> date not given]    [Text] The cruelest moment has arrived for us to pay a  final tribute to the father of the Ivorian nation. On this  painful occasion, we must once more respectfully bow down in  memory of the renowned builder of modern Cote d'Ivoire and renew  our profound compassion for the great Houphouet-Boigny family.    I call on all sons and daughters of Cote d'Ivoire, all our  friends, to remain dignified and calm at this painful moment of  separation. Our ability to perpetuate his action will depend  upon our courage and determination to follow the path toward  peace and development paved by the great deceased .    Fellow Ivorians, the world is watching us. It is together,  in peace, brotherhood, solidarity, and love that we will be able  to ensure the continuity of his gigantic work.    Let us all pray for the repose of his soul!</p>

			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Heathrow Express impasse continues TALKS at the Department of Transport yesterday failed to resolve an impasse over the funding of the Pounds 300m Heathrow Express project, but further meetings are planned, Richard Tomkins writes. Plans for the 16-mile rail link between Heathrow airport and central London are threatened by a dispute between British Rail and BAA, the airports group. BAA says that British Rail is asking too high a price for the use of its tracks into Paddington station. British Rail says the line will boost BAA's profits at Heathrow and the company should be prepared to subsidise it. One observer said the talks had given rise to cautious optimism that a solution could be found.</p>

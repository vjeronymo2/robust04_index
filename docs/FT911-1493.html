			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Books: Pathos of discarded things - Poetry SELECTED POEMS Derek Mahon Viking Pounds 14.00. 194 pages LOVE IN A LIFE Andrew Motion Faber Pounds 11.99 hardback, Pounds 4.99 paperback, 62 pages LIKE LOUIS MacNeice, Derek Mahon is an Irish poet (born in Belfast, 1941) who eludes characterisation by his Irishness. His subjects are general, his sensibility is that shared by all poets whose primary interest is in making a variety of verbal objects and thereby, as he writes in the MacNeice memorial poem which heads this new selection, 'keeping the colours new'. Mahon's Irish interests are not repressed - in fact they are abounding; but unlike his near-contemporary Seamus Heaney or Paul Muldoon (another devotee of MacNeice) he does not seek to create an Irish myth of any sort. Interested in everything, and infallibly interesting, he is simply and thoroughly a poet in a way that not only recalls MacNeice, but the distinctions of Auden, Lowell and Elizabeth Bishop too. Like all those poets he is blessed with technical accomplishment. His management of metrics, stanza and rhyme, his sure sense of the fine, ringing, quirky, inevitable line, his eager appetite for, and seemingly instant command of, new forms set him apart from most of his English and American contemporaries, and they, on the whole, are a brilliant lot. Reading through this book - his second selected volume, but with the feel of a 'Collected' - one cannot fail to admire Mahon's knack of being himself in whatever formal guise he adopts, be it epigram, short lyric, verse letter, villanelle, dramatic monologue, free translation (Ovid, Corbiere, Rimbaud, Pasternak, Jaccottet) or big stanza-statement poem. Every piece here is fully achieved; the ambition behind the book must be enormous but is never obtrusive. Beyond the attributes of technique there is in Mahon's best poems an endlessly ponderable richness of language, a sense of which may be gained from the opening stanza of his most celebrated piece, 'A Disused Shed in Co. Wexford': 'Even now there are places where a thought might grow - /Peruvian mines, worked out and abandoned /To a slow clock of condensation, /An echo trapped for ever, and a flutter /Of wild-flowers in the lift-shaft, /Indian compounds where the wind dances /And a door bangs with diminished confidence, /Lime crevices behind rippling rain-barrels, /Dog corners for bone burials; /And in a disused shed in Co. Wexford'. This poem expands on what might be thought of as Mahon's principal theme: the pathos of discarded things, the poetry of the contingency of everyday objects. 'Left to itself,' he writes in 'Disused Shed's' sister-poem, 'A Garage in Co. Cork', 'the functional will cast /A death-bed glow of picturesque abandon'. The poet's visionary task is no longer to descry Wordsworth's noble 'light that never was, on sea or land', so much as to notice the 'late sacramental gleam' with which the most mediocre bits and pieces of life will start to shine. 'We might be anywhere but are in one place only', he insists in this Elizabeth Bishop-like reverie on an obscure, mundane filling-station, into which he nevertheless manages to work, and charmingly, the Ovidian myth of Philemon and Baucis. 'A god who spent the night here once rewarded /Natural courtesy with eternal life - /Changing to petrol pumps, that they be spared/ For ever there, an old man and his wife'. It is one of the triumphs of Mahon's art that for all his resolute attention to the ordinary, he can be 'myth-kitty' in a powerfully plausible way to which Philip Larkin who coined the phrase could not reasonably have objected, as when in the book's grand finale, 'Death and the Sun', he imagines 'Plato's neolithic troglodyte /Released from his dark cinema' standing at last, 'Absurd and anxious, out in the open air', while (in a wonderful concluding flow of mixed metaphor) the 'Sun gongs its lenity from a brazen heaven /Listening in silence to his rich despair'. If Mahon in this hugely enjoyable gathering of poems shows himself to be free from any Irish stereotyping, the quintessentially English poet Andrew Motion in his bleakly impressive new collection, Love in a Life, gives the impression of wanting to emulate the linguistic violence and tonal daring of his Irish contemporaries Paul Muldoon and Tom Paulin. A bitter colloquialism constantly threatens the poised lyrical structures of the book's three short sections and actually causes 'The Vision of that Ancient Man' to abort: it ends 'like . . . Sod it; who cares?' But in breaking with traditional values, Motion gives striking expression to a burdened breadwinner's view of the modern world as endlessly aggravating, rawly inhospitable. The sad old whippet in 'It is an Offence' who regularly leaves his 'sloped, weary turds' by the poet's front door 'doesn't know he's doing, and yet /I'd still like to cover his arsehole with quick-set cement'. That is very much the mood of the book.</p>

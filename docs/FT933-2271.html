			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / The Liberal Democrats at Torquay: Tories fear heavy loss of Euro seats PRIME MINISTER John Major faces the humiliating prospect that a quarter of the Conservative party's remaining seats in the European parliament could be lost to the Liberal Democrats next June unless the government improves its standing with the electorate. A confidential analysis conducted by Conservative Central Office suggests that if this year's local election results were replicated in the European parliament vote next summer the Liberal Democrats would win eight of the 32 seats held by the government. The study - pointing to a collapse in the Conservative vote across a swathe of southern England from Brighton to Bath and beyond that into Cornwall - will provide a further boost to the morale of Mr Paddy Ashdown's Liberal Democrats at the formal opening of their annual conference this morning. It will reinforce the concerns of up to two dozen Tory MPs in southern and south-western England that their parliamentary seats are imperilled by the steady Liberal Democrat advance eastwards from Cornwall and Devon. Mr Major and Sir Norman Fowler, the Tory party chairman, acknowledged during visits to the West Country earlier this month that they could no longer brush aside the Liberal Democrat resurgence as a mid-term protest vote. That was followed by Conservative Central Office's decision to start immediately the selection process for the Westminster seats of Bath, North Cornwall and Devon so that the party's candidates are well entrenched by 1996 or 1997. At present Mr Ashdown's party holds none of the 78 European seats in England, Scotland and Wales and its ambitions have been limited to picking up perhaps two or at most three in next year's poll. The Conservative analysis could overstate the threat - the Liberal Democrat performance in local elections tends to be better than in European ones, partly because many wavering Conservative voters are unhappy with Mr Ashdown's pro-Europeanism. But senior Liberal Democrat figures suggested yesterday that the party might fight next June's election on national rather than European issues to capitalise on Mr Major's unpopularity. Conservative strategists are talking comfort from the fact that the analysis suggests it would lose at most one seat to Labour were local election results to be replicated. The government would also expect to win at least three and perhaps four of the six seats which will be created before next June's elections. But ministers are aware that the Conservatives' disastrous performance in the 1989 European elections - when Labour won 45 seats - marked the beginning of the end of Lady Thatcher's premiership. Assuming Mr Major survives the present political storms, the loss of a further batch of seats would be another dangerous blow to his premiership.</p>

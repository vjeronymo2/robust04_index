			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tomorrow's issue of ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI will probably  not be published. INTERFAX has learned that the publication of  the newspaper was suspended because it has no money to pay for  paper and printing.    The situation is explained by the fact that at the end of  December the editorial staff took over the ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI  from the Russian Government. However, the newspaper has not  been registered yet and therefore cannot carry out independent  financial transactions.</p>

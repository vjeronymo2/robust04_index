			<p><P> February 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUR STAMPS: HAND-DRAWN CACHETS REFLECT CREATIVITY  </P> <P> Question: I have seen Civil War patriotic covers (envelopes) with embossed  designs and some with hand-drawn designs. Would a cover from 1863 with a  hand-drawn flag on the reverse be considered a Civil War patriotic? My cover  has a 1-cent Franklin, 2-cent Jackson and 3-cent Washington stamp, and a  hand-drawn flag on the reverse. -- J.N.  </P> <P> Answer: Yes, this is a Civil War patriotic cover, worth maybe $20 or $30 (or  more), depending on the condition and postmarks. It sounds like a double-weight  letter, costing 6 cents postage, that is 3 cents per half ounce, the  first-class rate in 1863.  </P> <P> I happen to like hand-drawn cachets (cover designs) because they tend to be  "one-of-a-kind" and show some thought and creativity on the part of the sender  of long ago. Hand-drawn designs are not necessarily more valuable than printed  designs, and the overall condition of the stamps affixed and the cover's  appearance are the major factors that determine its market price. Civil War  mail isn't rare, but handsome covers in nicely preserved condition always have  a market.  </P> <P> Q: Do you think it is worthwhile to save a booklet of the recently released  Self-Adhesive Extraordinary stamps? -- G.N.  </P> <P> A: You're asking me to predict the future, something that is always hard to do  in stamp collecting. By "worthwhile" I assume that you mean whether or not  these stamps will be a good long-term investment, paying at least the  equivalent of bank interest for, say, 5 or 10 years.  </P> <P> It all depends on how many of these booklets are sold, how many are then used  up for postage and how many are left in pristine mint condition for future  collectors, who may or may not generate demand sufficient to make the market  price of these things rise over the years. None of these factors are known at  present, which is why stamp collecting is so exciting and interesting, even for  stamp booklets, which non-collectors might consider just routine postal issues  good only for use on daily mail.  </P> <P> Of course, you can always use the stamps for postage at any time, as they will  never be worth less than face value.  </P> <P> Q: I enclose a copy of my letter addressed to the Postmaster General concerning  a problem some of your readers may have encountered -- receiving mail from  overseas with the stamp missing. These are usually commemoratives or high-value  issues. It is something that I experience quite regularly these days, and for a  stamp collector it is most frustrating.  </P> <P> Surely foreign mail must have the correct postage to enter this country, so I  must conclude the stamp theft takes place in the U.S. Postal Service. I urge  anyone else who has experienced this problem to write to the Postmaster General  at the U.S. Postal Service, 475 L'Enfant Plaza S.W., Washington, D.C. 20260. --  G.M.  </P> <P> A: You can understand, of course, that somebody might take an unused stamp off  an envelope with the intention of reusing it. But when canceled stamps,  especially of the kind that a collector might enjoy, are ripped off mail, then  we can only speculate how desperate some postal employee must be to add nice  canceled stamps to his collection.  </P> <P> The Postmaster General and his staff would be pleased to hear any compliments  or legitimate complaints that mail-users have, although in this case it might  be appropriate also to notify your local post office about this problem in the  hope that they can do something to correct it if the stamp swipings are taking  place locally.  </P> <P> Q: With all the recent turmoil in China, are their stamps illegal or hard to  obtain? -- T.E.  </P> <P> A: No. Stamps from the People's Republic of China are freely imported and  bought and sold in the United States. Many local dealers will be happy to show  you a selection.  </P> <P> Q: What is going to happen with the stamp market in view of the changes in  prices in the Scott catalogues? -- R.Q.  </P> <P> A: Until 1988, Scott stamp catalogues traditionally overpriced most stamps, it  being understood by collectors and dealers alike that the real values were  below catalogue values. With the 1989 and 1990 catalogue editions, Scott has  announced a change in pricing policy. Now catalogues indicate net retail prices  -- in other words, the price at which you may find a stamp for sale at a stamp  shop. A lot of philatelists dislike the new pricing scheme, but everybody knows  that the real values of stamps are only indirectly affected by catalogues.  </P></p>

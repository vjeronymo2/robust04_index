			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Correspondents identified by caption; from the "National </F> News Hookup" program]    [Text] Former U.S. Secretary of State Kissinger, who is  currently on a visit to Beijing, was interviewed by station  reporters on the afternoon of 13 May. [video shows a  correspondent with a microphone in hand sitting across from  Kissinger; a caption on the bottom of the screen reads: An  interview with Kissinger by correspondents Gu Yunlong (6253 0061  7893), Wu Wei (0702 3555), and Xie Li (6200 0500])    [Correspondent] Dr. Kissinger, as a farseeing politician,  what are your views on China's status and role in the world  political and economic orders now and in the future? How should  China proceed to take advantage of the opportunity presented to  China by the world?    [Kissinger, in English fading into Chinese translation]  First, the new world order will be composed of some influential  countries: the United States, Japan, China, Russia, Europe, and  India. These nations interact with one another free of any  ideological conflicts and share common interests in many areas.    China attaches great importance to stability in Asia, does  not have any territorial designs, and does not have troops  stationed outside its borders. The United States has no  territorial designs, either. This can serve as a basis for  common efforts toward maintaining global peace.    China will play an increasingly important role on the world  stage. Economically, China will grow in importance as an  exporter; at the same time, it will also become a major  importer, thus becoming an integral part of the world economy.  Because the world economy is closely linked with countries of  the world, China's development will have a direct impact on  world economic development. China follows with great interest  countries of the world, which, on the other hand, have shown  great interest in China. In the next century, China will play  an even bigger role.</p>

			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets: HK announces companies to replace Jardine group Trading of index-related stocks is expected to dominate the Hong Kong exchange on Monday as investors react to the choice of seven companies to replace five Jardine group companies in the Hang Seng index, Reuter reports from Hong Kong. However, analysts said there were few surprises in the index changes, which were announced on Friday. Joining the index on November 30 are Amoy Properties, Guangdong Investment, Johnson Electric Holdings and Oriental Press Group Ltd. On February 28, Shangri-La Asia, Sino Land and South China Morning Post (Holdings) will join the index. Textile companies Lai Sun Garment International and Winsor Industrial Corp will be deleted from the index on November 30. Analysts said that investors might be disappointed by the failure of banking group Guoco Group, investment company Henderson Investment and First Pacific to make it into the index. Their shares had recently risen on confidence they would be included. Brokers said the new constituents were capitalised at around Dollars 11bn, compared with around Dollars 23bn worth of stocks departing. However, the Hang Seng index as a proportion of the market would stay roughly the same without the Jardine group. The revised Hang Seng Index will cover about 70 per cent of the market in value terms. The total number of constituent stocks will remain at 33. Jardine Strategic and Jardine Matheson will delist in December. Land, Mandarin and Dairy Farm will delist next March.</p>

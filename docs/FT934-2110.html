			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / International Company News: Austrian Airlines to resume talks on alliance Austrian Airlines (AUA) is to resume talks on long-term co-operation with Swissair and Lufthansa following the collapse last month of the Alcazar project. Alcazar was aimed at the merger of Austrian and Swiss carriers with Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines. The supervisory board of the Austrian carrier decided at a meeting on Sunday to give a new impetus to negotiations with both the Swiss and German airlines. It also wants to hold separate discussions with Lauda Air, the private airline run by Mr Nicky Lauda, the former Formula One racing car driver, in which Lufthansa has a 25 per cent stake. 'The failure of Alcazar has created a new situation and we don't exclude anything,' AUA said yesterday. This could include a tie-up with Lauda Air, though that would not solve AUA's main strategic concern, which is to find an international partner. The Austrian carrier held parallel talks with Lufthansa during the Alcazar negotiations, and the German airline recently reaffirmed its interest in co-operation with AUA. Such co-operation, however, would have to take into account AUA's existing technical and commercial agreements with Swissair, AUA said. Earlier this month, Swissair said it was considering the possibility of a smaller alliance with SAS and AUA as an alternative to the Alcazar alliance, which collapsed after months of negotiations over differences on the choice of a US partner. The Austrian carrier has also been approached by Mr Lauda, who is reported to be offering AUA a 30-40 per cent stake in Lauda Air. The Austrian carrier expects operating losses to rise sharply this year, to Sch700m (Dollars 58.5m), compared with a deficit of Sch437m in 1992. The net loss is expected to be Sch460m after allocations from reserves.</p>

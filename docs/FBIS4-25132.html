			<p>BFN     [Text] Tianjin, June 7 (XINHUA) -- China has just  concluded exploration in the sea areas 200 km east of Wenzhou,  Zhejiang Province, marking the successful beginning of the first  Sino-foreign oil exploration project in the East China Sea.    The exploration, jointly undertaken by China National  Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOC) and Texaco, of the United  States, started at the end of March, according to a spokesman  from CNOC.    The Sino-U.S. team completed a seismic survey 100 meters  down, despite harsh weather conditions at the sea.    The East China Sea Oil Exploration Project is a new frontier  for the China National Offshore Oil Corporation in 750,000  square km of sea. Before this, China had independently  conducted seismic surveys in 150,000 square km since 1979 and  drilled five experimental wells, four of which have shown  excellent oil prospects. About 1,000 oil-bearing structures  have also been found.    To speed up the development of oil exploration in the East  China Sea, China conducted the Fourth International Invitation  for bids for 20 locations in 72,800 square km of sea from June  1992 to June 1993. Some 73 companies from 19 countries competed  for the projects and 15 oil exploration companies from seven  countries succeeded in the bidding, with the total risk  investment of 300 million U.S. dollars.    The successful end of this phase of prospecting in the  contracted area will provide scientific basis for the upcoming  drilling of the first well this October, the spokesman said.    About 21 experimental wells are expected to be drilled by  the  end of 1996.</p>

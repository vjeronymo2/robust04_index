			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Disabled may get cash in lieu of community care The government yesterday announced plans to devolve some of the funding for disabled people from local authorities to recipients of services, allowing them to purchase their own care for the first time. Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, said cash payments would initially be limited to 'a relatively small group, probably those disabled people who are able and willing to manage their care'. The devolution of funding will require legislation, and could pave the way to a more radical shift of funding as an extension of the government's care in the community programme. The funding proposal follows the announcement earlier this week of legislation to protect disabled people against discrimination at work. Mrs Bottomley said the funding legislation would be permissive, enabling but not obliging local authorities to make direct cash payments to some disabled people in lieu of community care. She said: 'Direct payments are a logical extension of the Citizen's Charter. They will give disabled people greater independence and choice and involve them and their carers more fully in their own care.' She conceded, however, that the making of direct payments 'carried some risks'. Local authorities will be given responsibility for deciding whether to make payments. 'There will be no overlap with social security benefits,' she added. The health department refused to be drawn on the amounts it would like to see devolved to individuals, stressing that it still had to consult with 'key interests to make sure the details are right'.</p>

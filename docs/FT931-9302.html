			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / Letter: Reform that centralises Sir, Joe Rogaly ('Vaudeville days are here', February 5) makes the amazing assertion that 'the government's education reforms are excellent', while suggesting that its 'continued assault on local democracy is scandalous'. Don't you realise that while parts of the education reforms may be excellent, many others are essentially a centralising attack on local democracy, removing more and more power to Whitehall.

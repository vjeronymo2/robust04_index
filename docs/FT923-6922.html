			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / Nato scales down military plans for Bosnia NATO'S latest plans to protect relief convoys in the former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia have been substantially scaled down after western governments this week pulled back from making substantial military commitments to the area. Alliance sources told Reuter yesterday new plans would probably involve no more than 10,000 troops. This compares with earlier estimates of 100,000 troops needed to secure a land corridor from the Adriatic port of Split to the besieged Bosnian capital of Sarajevo. The new plan envisages that troops would only secure the port, from which escorted convoys will leave once they have the go-ahead from the warring factions. Military planners are reported to have been encouraged by the UN's successful delivery of food by road to the besieged town of Gorazde earlier this week. The latest Nato thinking brings the alliance closer to plans being developed by the nine-nation Western European Union (WEU), although any eventual operation will probably be carried out under United Nations auspices. The Nato plan is due to be considered by ambassadors on Monday. But some senior officers say the new blueprint could entail a much greater risk for western troops, a danger which was underlined yesterday when a sniper killed a Ukrainian soldier serving with United Nations peacekeeping forces in Sarajevo. Meanwhile, aid officials in Zagreb, the Croatian capital, yesterday confirmed that 'negotiations are in progress with all parties in Bosnia to liberate people' from detention camps in Bosnia. The officials would not confirm a US report that Serb authorities had indicated they might open the camps if the international community assumes responsibility for the inmates, but a senior western official said: 'The report is credible. Serbs have in recent days expressed some willingness to turn some or all prisoners out of the camps.' An International Committee of the Red Cross official warned, however, that 'there is a real problem. You can't just fling open the doors. Many of them are safer in the camps than outside, where they will only fall victim to this 'ethnic cleansing'.' US intelligence agencies estimate there are about 170,000 people in the camps, mostly run by Serbs although some are operated by Croats and Moslems. In New York, the 47-member UN Islamic group called yesterday for a resumed session of the General Assembly to discuss the crisis over Bosnia-Hercegovina. UN officials said the session would probably begin on Monday so that members might voice their views before the London conference that will be co-chaired by Mr John Major, UK prime minister, and Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general. An immediate goal of the Islamic states is to bring pressure through the 179-member Assembly on the Security Council to lift the arms embargo imposed on Bosnia-Hercegovina while it was still a republic within former Yugoslavia.</p>

			<p><P> November 20, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> CZECH DISSIDENT REJECTS VISA  </P> <P> Leading Czechoslovak dissident Vaclav Havel said today he had been offered a  passport to travel to Sweden to accept an award but had declined because of the  situation in his country.  </P> <P> Havel, an internationally known playwright, told a news conference in Prague:  "I will not make use of the passport because the situation at home is becoming  dramatic. I do not want to serve as a front for this regime, which would claim  they let a leading dissident travel abroad, and thus try to mask the drastic  repressions we are witnessing."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Switzerland's defense and foreign ministers have  come out in support of Swiss participation in peacekeeping  missions by United Nations blue helmet troops. Kaspar Villiger  and Flavio Cotti said such participation would be in line with  Switzerland's tradition of supporting peaceful solutions for  political conflicts. [Defense Minister] Mr. Villiger, speaking  ahead of a national vote on the issue in June, said all Swiss  blue helmet personnel would take part on a purely voluntary  basis. He said the Swiss contingent would only take part in  noncombat missions, that all parties in a conflict would have to  agree to a UN deployment, and that Swiss troops could be  withdrawn at any time.</p>

			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / International Company News: CP Forest Products trims shortfall CANADIAN Pacific Forest Products, one of North America's biggest newsprint producers, reduced operating losses sharply in the first nine months, helped by firmer prices for some products, greater efficiency and a lower Canadian dollar, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal. Operating loss was CDollars 91.3m (USDollars 68.9m) against CDollars 153.4m, and the final loss after special items was CDollars 125m, or CDollars 2.16 a share, against a loss of CDollars 188.4m, or CDollars 3.20, a year earlier. Sales were little changed at CDollars 1.4bn. The third-quarter final loss was CDollars 12.3m, or 20 cents, against a profit of CDollars 57.9m, or CDollars 1.10, last time.</p>

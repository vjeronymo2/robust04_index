			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Russian National Unity leader Aleksandr </F> Barkashov by MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS correspondent Aleksandr  Khinshteyn; place and date not given: "Humanist in a Black  Shirt: Corporal Barkashov Promises Ascent to Power in Two Years"]    [Text] RNE [Russian National Unity] leader Aleksandr  Barkashov agreed to give an interview to MOSKOVSKIY  KOMSOMOLETS--a newspaper very much disliked by him--with great  reluctance. And at the start of our interview in his huge  apartment on Vavilov Street he warned me, as he put his crutches  aside, that I should be totally objective so that all of us,  biased journalists, will not regret it later when our heads may  get cracked together. Two quite impressive-looking guys, who  opened the door for me and then stayed on duty in the "foyer,"  were the best proof that there will be no shortage of those  capable of cracking others' heads together.    [Khinshteyn] Is it true that you escaped the White House  through underground passages?    [Barkashov] No, I came out together with enforcement  ministers--Barannikov, Dunayev, and Achalov. They were the first  to leave, while many others, including Rutskoy, were afraid to  come out at all and did not believe the guarantees given by  Alpha. As we were coming out, however, an Alpha officer  separated the enforcement ministers from the rest, saying that  there was an order to detain them. Naturally this alarmed us,  and I expressed a desire to be arrested together with them. I  showed my passport and said that I was a member of Achalov's  staff. But the officer said that he did not have an order to  this effect.    [Khinshteyn] How many of your people died?    [Barkashov] Two, and 11 were wounded. As we were coming out  of the White House they somehow got separated from our chain and  ended up brutally murdered. Their noses and ears were cut off,  fingers torn apart. (Nothing of this kind is mentioned in the  forensic report I have seen.--A.Kh.) The "democrats" did this  out of fear. They thought of themselves as heroes, Rambos, and  here they are running scared shitless.    [Khinshteyn] Did you hide at bases and safehouses after the  October events?    [Barkashov] Partly. There were several safe apartments where  we lived, because literally in a week I learned that I was on an  all-Russia fugitive list. I also knew through my own channels in  the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] that there was an  advisement not to take live prisoners during the arrest of  several persons, including myself.    [Khinshteyn] How did the assassination attempt on you occur?    [Barkashov] It was late night and I was walking along the  road to Krasnogorsk; I heard the sound of a car in the distance.  They approached from behind. I did not hear the shots, but felt  the pain right away. I flagged a passing vehicle. Just in case,  I let the first one pass me, and then the second--not a  passenger car--took me to a hospital.    [Khinshteyn] Was this an action of our special services?  Would it have not been easier for them, though, to kill you?    [Barkashov] Undoubtedly, it was the special services.  Perhaps  it would have been easier to shoot me to death, but things do  not always come out the way one wants. Also, they may have  thought that I was armed, too.    [Khinshteyn] How did it come out that it was you in the  hospital?    [Barkashov] I do not know. I checked in there under a  different name, but suddenly general procuracy officers showed  up and suggested that I move to the MVD hospital. Moreover, they  said that they did not have a warrant for my arrest. Despite my  protestations, however, I was transferred there under heavy  guard.    [Khinshteyn] Is it true that the RNE maintains ties with the  KGB-FCS [Federal Counterintelligence Service]?    [Barkashov] Not true. Only a movement that does not have its  own ideology and strategic goals can be controlled. It can be  manipulated. The RNE has a clearly enunciated program and  defined ideas.    [Khinshteyn] Do you have people working for special  services?    [Barkashov] In the RNE--no; around it--without a doubt,  mainly from the Main Protection Directorate. It is impossible  for an agent to hide his intentions for long. People who come to  the party resonate with it in their soul. The soul--do you  understand? One cannot resonate artificially.    [Khinshteyn] Do your guys conduct intelligence work?    [Barkashov] We have to collect information in opposing  movements. Those whom we suspect of extremism with respect to  the Russian people and the Russian nationalist movement, in  order to protect ourselves and be ready for whatever comes. For  instance, I consider Beytar such an organization.    [Khinshteyn] How many members are there in the RNE?    [Barkashov] In Moscow--1,500; across Russia--about 15,000.  This is just the confederates.    [Khinshteyn] God forbid, you come to power. Will there be  pogroms?    [Barkashov] What nonsense. Serious people always start with  important things.    [Khinshteyn] You mean pogroms are unimportant?    [Barkashov] Nonsense. Are we going after anybody now? We do  not even bother MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS, and never will.    [Khinshteyn] Will you let people emigrate? Yeltsin, for  instance?    [Barkashov] If people disagree with our policy, they will be  free to leave. But if they have committed crimes, they must be  tried. In any case, this applies to the current government.  Their activities will have to be investigated.    [Khinshteyn] And when will this happen?    [Barkashov] In a year, a year and a half. Definitely within  two years. Time works in our favor. We will build an objective  opinion, will get the support of the majority of the population,  and will absolutely legitimately come to power. When I was in  prison I was asked to run in absentia in four non-Moscow  districts, and I am 98 percent certain that I would have won.  What for, though?    [Khinshteyn] I see you have a volume of Hitler on the  bookshelf. Do you like him?    [Barkashov] And why do you not notice that I have Rozanov or  Blavatskaya? As to Hitler... I like what he did for his country.    [Khinshteyn] Are you for concentration camps?    [Barkashov] No, I am against it. I tell my wife: Do not  plant  potatoes. When she does the weeding, collects bugs, my heart  aches. I imagine a concentration camp.    [Khinshteyn] You sound like such a humanist. Like Romain  Rolland.    [Barkashov] Do not say this. I am a true humanist. A natural  one. It is the state that concerns itself with idiots while  millions of Russian children are not provided with elementary  rations. We need to take care of normal children.    [Khinshteyn] Since your release have you seen any of your  White House confederates?    [Barkashov] Those I wanted to see I already have. After all,  I am ill--can my friends not visit me? Zhirinovskiy came; he sat  in that very chair. We put away a bottle of cognac to my health.    [Khinshteyn] Is it true that you were an instructor in  Egypt?    [Barkashov] I trained in a special unit training  international soldiers for the Near East, but did not get a  chance to fight: The president of Egypt refused our aid;  although I did write memorandums asking to send volunteers to  fight on the side of the oppressed Arab proper suffering from  Israel's aggressive policy. So what--I like justice; there us  such a trait among Russians. I transferred to reserves in the  rank of senior sergeant. Now I am a corporal. How? I took two  stripes off and became a corporal.    [Khinshteyn] I just cannot figure it out: Would it not be  easier to ban you?    [Barkashov] It will not work. We act within the boundaries  of  the current law. We do not have shock troopers--people, carrying  arms--and neither do we have arms; we never have. That we are  better prepared for some actions than others is a result of  discipline. While other parties gather together only once a year  for a rally, we work daily. We sponsor plants, educational  institutions, military units. Our guys go there regularly, sell  newspapers, conduct political propaganda. But we cannot be  charged with anything. One has to present one's thoughts  correctly.    [Khinshteyn] But you did arm yourselves with submachine  guns,  did you not?    [Barkashov] I did, and I fired it. We had an order from the  Supreme Soviet: protect peaceful demonstrators from being shot  at. An order from a legitimately elected authority.    [Khinshteyn] That is, there is nothing to get you on?    [Barkashov] All right, so they kept me in prison. What did  they achieve? Only a rise in our authority. Of course, it is  better for them to let us go.    [Khinshteyn] Aleksandr Petrovich, are you a fascist?    [Barkashov] I am for national revival and justice for all,  without degeneration of the Russian nation. If this is called  national-socialism, I am a national-socialist.    [Khinshteyn] Are there people in the current government of  Russia who support you?    [Barkashov] I do not know...    [Khinshteyn] Or perhaps you do not want to say?    [Barkashov] Perhaps. Do not ask questions to which you  cannot  get an answer. [end Barkashov]    As we parted, Barkashov, who promised to accept me into  the RNE if I a) change my convictions, b) agree with the  program, and c) actively work, gave me an escort. "So that you  do not get beaten up," he explained. Emerging onto the street,  my escort waved to someone invisible. Meaning, it is all right.  One of ours. It was a somewhat hasty assumption.</p>

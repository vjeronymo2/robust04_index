			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> FORMER LION STANDOUT IS ARMED, READY TO MAKE A MAJOR LEAGUE MOVE  </P> <P> After almost five seasons in the minor leagues, Jim Bruske is finally making  his big pitch for a job in the majors.  </P> <P> His former coach at Loyola Marymount University, Dave Snow, always told Bruske  that his ticket to the major leagues was as a pitcher. Fortunately, or maybe  unfortunately as he develops his pitching skills, the Antelope Valley native  was also a good hitter.  </P> <P> Always noted for his strong throwing arm, Snow used Bruske in right field. That  way, Bruske could hit four or five times a game.  </P> <P> The Lions went on to win the West Coast Conference championship in 1986 and  traveled to Omaha for the school's only appearance in at the College World  Series.  </P> <P> Bruske was selected outstanding player of the NCAA West Regional that season  when he hit four home runs and drove in 11 runs in the five-game tournament. In  54 games that season, he batted .321 with 12 home runs and 50 runs batted in.  </P> <P> Snow also used Bruske in the starting rotation, but the right-hander injured  his throwing hand in an early season start against Cal State Fullerton and saw  limited opportunities as a pitcher. Bruske was 3-1 with a 4.56 earned-run  average for the eight games in which he pitched.  </P> <P> The Cleveland Indians, who drafted Bruske in the first round of the second  phase of the major league draft in 1986, made note of Bruske's offensive  contributions to the Lions.  </P> <P> Bruske joined the Indians organization in mid-season in 1986 as an outfielder,  alternating between right and center field. That was the routine until a year  ago.  </P> <P> Just prior to Instructional League play at Baseball City, Fla., in September,  the Indians told Bruske of the decision to let him pitch.  </P> <P> "It was a mutual decision (to try pitching), in that I said I'd go to  Instructional League and find out if I was capable of pitching in double A,"  Bruske said. "I did pretty well. Learned a lot, that's for sure."  </P> <P> It has paid off with a winning record for the Eastern League affiliate of the  Indians. Bruske, 25, has an 8-2 record, two complete game shutouts, and a 3.57  ERA in 103 innings of work.  </P> <P> The pitching-poor Indians might call him up for the final month of the season,  or have him join them for spring training in March.  </P> <P> Bruske knew he would need some refinement, so he reported to Baseball City  following the '89 season to work on his pitching flaws.  </P> <P> "Basically I started from the beginning (as a pitcher)," said Bruske, who has  pitched in 30 games this season, 11 in the starting rotation. "Mechanics-wise,  I was not even close to what I should have been. The pitching coach there, Will  George, really helped me a lot. And he still is."  </P> <P> George handles the Canton-Akron (Ohio) pitchers, as well as those in the  organization's instructional league.  </P> <P> A year ago, Bruske was named the Eastern League outfielder with the best  throwing arm in a poll of observers by the monthly publication, Baseball  America. So he knew he could throw hard. But he might have been trying to get  the ball to home plate too quickly.  </P> <P> "I had had trouble rushing everything out with my pitching motion," Bruske  said. "Few coaches had ever worked on my mechanics before, although Coach Snow  did a little bit at Loyola. I was always worried about hitting more than  pitching back in my college days."  </P> <P> Bruske hit .406 his sophomore at Antelope Valley Community College and  impressed scouts enough to get selected by the San Diego Padres in the seventh  round of the January 1985 draft. He was also selected by the Seattle Mariners  in the third round of the June 1985 draft.  </P> <P> He also pitched at Antelope Valley and struck out 101 batters in 69 innings  with a 2.50 ERA.  </P> <P> Snow initially listed Bruske as a pitcher on the Loyola roster. When Snow  called on him to relieve in the '86 regional victory over UCLA, Bruske  responded with 1 2/3 innings of scoreless relief -- allowing only one hit --  and was the winning hurler.  </P> <P> The current Loyola baseball coach, Chris Smith, Snow's top assistant in 1986,  said that Bruske was one of the best all-around athletes the team has ever had.  </P> <P> "He is such a good athlete, it was difficult call as to what position was his  best," Smith said.  </P> <P> After the Indians signed Bruske, his destiny seemed to be as an outfielder.  During his first three professional seasons, he played for rookie league and  Class A teams at Batavia and Kingston (N.Y.) and double-A teams at Williamsport  (Penn.). His highest was .243 at Batavia. At the start of the '89 season, the  Indians demoted him back to Kingston, and he hit .290 with five home runs and  38 RBIs in 63 games. He was promoted to Canton-Akron, but didn't get much  playing time.  </P> <P> "It's funny, but I was having the best year of my career (as a hitter)," Bruske  said. "They wanted me to go back to Kingston and get my confidence level up and  hit for a higher average. I got called up to Canton and started off well there,  too. I was doing well, but the next thing I knew, I was only in the lineup two  times a week and my average started to drop."  </P> <P> But Bruske has always remembered what Snow told him about his best chance of  making it to the big leagues.  </P> <P> "I guess, right now, I'm throwing in the high 80s," Bruske said. "I'm working  on a change-up right now. That's what I have to throw for strikes."  </P> <P> Previously, his repertoire of pitches included only a fastball and a slider.  </P> <P> "(The Indians) are trying to get more of our pitchers to throw the split-finger  fastball," Bruske said. "At this point, they haven't mentioned it to me yet,  but I expect that when I'm at the instructional league in September, they  probably will."  </P> <P> Two of Bruske's '86 Loyola Marymount teammates have already played in the major  leagues -- Cincinnati Red relief pitcher Tim Layana and Dodger outfielder Billy  Bean. Bean is currently playing for the Dodgers' top minor-league squad at  Albuquerque, N.M., but played half the '89 season with the Dodgers and parts of  '87 and '88 with the Detroit Tigers.  </P> <P> "After 4 1/2 years (of trying), I still love it," Bruske said. "But it's a job,  and you learn that. I don't miss hitting as much as I thought I would."  </P> <P> But he doesn't like all aspects of life in the minors.  </P> <P> "The bus rides from town to town on road trips are pretty brutal," he said.  </P> <P> In the past few seasons, he's hit against Layana in the Eastern League.  </P> <P> "I faced him 10 times -- didn't do too well, but I hit the ball pretty hard a  few times," Bruske said.  </P> <P> This season he's pitched to Loyola alumni Bobby DeJardin and Don Sparks,  playing in the New York Yankees' organization at Albany, N.Y. After the season  is over, and each of the Loyola baseball alumni have returned to Southern  California, they stay in shape by working out together at Loyola.  </P></p>

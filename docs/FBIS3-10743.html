Baena  Soares stated that the nineties are not the sixties.    Upon his arrival in Chile, where he will participate in the  presidential succession ceremony on 11 March, Baena Soares said:  Many things have changed and it is necessary to consider the  issue of Cuba's reinsertion into the organization. Baena went on  to say that he could not predict the decision of OAS members on  the matter and stated that the subject has not been included in  the agenda of the general assembly or permanent commission.</p>

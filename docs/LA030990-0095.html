			<p><P> March 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOME TECH / WHAT'S NEW IN VIDEO: SONY SPONSORS 'VISIONS OF U.S.' COMPETITION  </P> <P> ABC's "America's Funniest Home Videos" isn't the only place you can send those  camcorder productions you're so proud of. If you have something considerably  more ambitious than a shot of junior accidentally hitting Dad in the groin with  a baseball (ever notice how much of the "funny" stuff in that show is based on  pain?), then you might like to submit it to the sixth annual "Visions of U.S."  contest.  </P> <P> Sponsored by Sony and administered by the American Film Institute, the  competition welcomes entries from people who are able to "communicate their  self-expression and personal vision in this new medium." Tapes are being  accepted in four categories -- fiction, nonfiction, experimental and music  video. A "Young People's Merit Award" will recognize video makers under the age  of 18.  </P> <P> Judging the tapes (more than 600 were received last year) will be film  directors Jonathan Demme, Amy Jones and Jerry Kramer, producer Karen Murphy,  actors LeVar Burton, Willem Dafoe and Tim Robbins, and Rolling Stone editor  Jeffrey Ressner. All entries must be produced and submitted on half-inch VHS or  Beta, or 8mm cassettes, and can run no longer than a half-hour.  </P> <P> The grand-prize winner will get a new top-of-the-line Sony Video 8 camcorder.  First through third prize in each category is a Sony home-video system.  Deadline: June 15.  </P> <P> Information: (213) 856-7743.  </P> <P> THIS WEEK'S MOVIES  </P> <P> Since you may only be able to dream about professional baseball this spring,  maybe renting "Field of Dreams" (MCA, no suggested retail price, MPAA-rated PG)  will help stir your imagination. On the other hand, you might be better off  playing computer baseball.  </P> <P> This fantasy concerns a farmer (Kevin Costner) who obeys a mysterious voice,  builds a baseball field and winds up with the spirit of banned-from-the-game  Shoeless Joe Jackson on his hands (and coming out of the ozone using a  different arm than in the 1910s).  </P> <P> The would-be Capra-esque concoction -- also starring Amy Madigan, James Earl  Jones and Burt Lancaster -- hit a home run with most critics and a lot of  theater patrons last year. It was also nominated for an Academy Award as best  picture of the year. But "Bull Durham," also starring Costner and available on  tape, is an infinitely better and truer film about the national pastime.  </P> <P> Other 1989 movies out this week on video: "Romero" (Vidmark, $89.95, PG-13),  "Shocker" (MCA, no suggested retail price, R), "Phantom of the Opera" (horror  version; RCA/Columbia, $89.95, R), "Le Petit Amour" (Prism, $79.95, R),  "Beverly Hills Brats" (Media, $89.95, PG-13).  </P> <P> Other recent video releases not included in previous columns: "Breaking In"  (HBO, $89.99, R), "The Package" (Orion, $89.98, "The Big Picture"  (RCA/Columbia, $89.95, PG-13), "Apartment Zero" (Academy, $89.95, R),  "Bloodfist" (MGM/UA, $89.95, R), "Far From the Madding Crowd" (MGM/UA, $29.95).

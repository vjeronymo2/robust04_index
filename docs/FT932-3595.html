			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / Hitch for Clinton's court plans WASHINGTON'S newest and most virulent disease - acquired household help payments deficiency syndrome - was yesterday presenting complications for President Bill Clinton's likely choice for the Supreme Court. The White House confirmed US media reports that Judge Stephen Breyer of Massachusetts and his wife had for several years failed to make social security payments on an elderly woman who was a part- time help in their home. They had apparently made back payments and paid a penalty earlier this year following revelations in the cases of Ms Zoe Baird and Judge Kimba Wood, respectively nominated and considered by Mr Clinton for the position of attorney general. The president was said to have been impressed by Judge Breyer, chief of the federal appeals bench on the Boston circuit, at a White House lunch on Friday. No announcement was then made to allow for last-minute background checks, but the Breyers were asked to stay on in the Washington area for a few days and the other leading candidate, Mr Bruce Babbitt, the interior secretary, said he was content in his present position. There was no early word yesterday from the White House as to whether Judge Breyer's nomination was now in doubt. But one obvious problem, instantly alluded to by Mr William Cohen, the Republican senator from Maine, is that nominating him could prompt the widespread perception that a double standard is applied to male and female candidates for high office. During the Baird and Wood controversies, it was frequently alleged that no male nominee would ever have been subjected to inquiry about the affairs of his personal household. Two male cabinet members - Mr Ron Brown at the Commerce Department and Mr Federico Pena at transportation  - were confirmed in office after disclosing that they had failed to pay the relevant taxes on their domestic employment. Women's groups are also upset that Mr Clinton dropped Ms Lani Guinier's nomination to the justice department civil rights division. There are shades of difference in the three household help cases. Ms Baird and her husband, a law professor at Yale, had hired a Peruvian couple, apparently knowing that it was illegal at the time to hire undocumented immigrants. Judge Wood and her husband, a journalist at Time magazine, committed no technical breach of the law - their recruitment of an illegal alien occured when there was no proscription against such hiring - but were caught in the Baird backlash. Judge Breyer and his wife, a psychologist, are said not to have paid social security payments which they thought unnecessary because their household help, a US citizen, was already old enough to be receiving social security benefits. Current US law requires the employer of casual labour, such as nannies and babysitters, to pay social security taxes whenever a sum of more than Dollars 50 (Pounds 32) a quarter is involved. This income threshold is considered ridiculously low, leading to widespread evasion, and changes are now in front of Congress.</p>

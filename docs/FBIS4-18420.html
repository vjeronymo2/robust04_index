			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sebastiano Messina: "Berlusconi Plans New </F> Constitution"]    [Excerpt] Rome -- [passage omitted] Forza Italia's experts  are working in top secret, following Wednesday's [27 March]  meeting between [Forza Italia leader] Silvio Berlusconi and  [Northern League Secretary] Umberto Bossi. Berlusconi's  institutional advisers are stressing that it is the government  that will draw up the plan for a new federal Constitution.  However, on the basis of disclosures from reliable sources  within both leaderships, it is possible to forecast a process of  institutional reforms that could profoundly change the face of  Italian democracy over the coming year.  <H5>  Plan of Attack </H5>   Berlusconi's plan of attack will have three main objectives.  The form of the state will transition from a republic with  centralized powers to a federal republic. The form of  government will transform the parliamentary democracy into a  semi-presidentialist system along the lines of the French Fifth  Republic. And the electoral law will replace the Mattarella Law  with a two-round system, another import from France.    On the first point, federalism, agreement is less remote  than  it may seem. If the League relinquishes its provocative theory  of the three republics (of the Po Valley, Etruria, and the  South) and if the National Alliance, having already gone as far  as to accept "decentralization," takes a further step, the  five-party group of Forza Italia, the League, the Alliance, the  CCD [Christian Democratic Center], and the UDC [Center Union]  could agree on a system in which the regions are half-way  between Germany's Laender and Switzerland's cantons.    "The outlook is clear: Italy will have three or four  `cantons,' achieved by means of a federal Constitution," the  League's constitutional expert, Gianfranco Miglio said. He  already has plans for how this will be achieved in parliament.  "Now, with half the members plus one, we can look at Article  138 of the Constitution and modify the constitutional plan by  means of referendums. In fact almost all the constitutions in  history have been formed by winners against losers, without  referendums. But we, being democrats, will achieve this result  by means of referendums. We have all the major sectors of the  media...."    The powers enjoyed by these regions-cantons have yet to be  defined, though there will certainly be radical changes to  Article 117 of the Constitution, which grants a number of powers  to the state, rather than the regions. Miglio will probably put  forward again, with a few corrections, Article 7 of the federal  Constitution launched at Assago three months ago. "The  government is responsible for foreign policy, defense, the  higher organization of justice, the currency, credit, overall  economic planning, and balancing measures. All other matters are  the responsibility of the republics and the autonomous regions."    The MSI [Italian Social Movement] could demand, and secure,  state responsibility for education, but there should be no  problems regarding fiscal decentralization. Thus, as Forza  Italia's program says, "the power to levy taxes must be taken  away from central government and transferred completely to the  local authorities, which must then pay to central government a  fixed proportion of the tax revenue gathered." In other words,  it is city councils (or regional governments) that will set tax  rates and gather taxes and duties, forwarding part of the  revenue to Rome. [passage omitted]</p>

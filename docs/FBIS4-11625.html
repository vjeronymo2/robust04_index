			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Juan Luis Batista] </F>   [Text] According to a telephone survey of 512 people who  watched last night's nationally televised presidential debate,  singer Ruben Blades of the Papa Egoro Movement won the debate.  The poll conducted at LA PRENSA's request by the Dichter and  Neira/Lou Harris polling firm gave the following results: Ruben  Blades, 40.2 percent; Ernesto Perez Balladares, 29 percent;  Ruben Dario Carles, 18.9 percent; and Eduardo Vallarino, 4.9  percent. The question asked was: Regardless of your  presidential preference, who do you think won the presidential  debate?    Seven percent of those polled did not answer the question or  said they did not know who had won. The margin of error in this  poll is plus or minus 5 percent. Of those polled, 32.2 percent  said their answer was not based on their party preferences,  while 57 percent admitted their answer was related to their  preferences. Meanwhile, 10.8 percent said they did not know  whether their answer was based on their party preference.    Asked whether the presidential debate changed their opinion,  76.9 percent replied it did not, while 11.5 percent said it did.  Another 11.6 percent said they did not know. Of those polled,  57 percent were women and 43 percent were men. As for their  ages, 43.7 percent were between the ages of 18 and 35; 30.1  percent between 36 and 49; and 26.2 percent were 50 or older.    A similar poll conducted by Dichter and Neira after the 11  April presidential debate showed Blades in the top spot,  followed by Perez Balladares, Carles, and Vallarino. In the  debate, which was organized by the Latin American Institute of  Advanced Studies (ILDEA) and the Media Presidential Debate  Committee, the candidates discussed general issues like the  economy, culture, the Canal, population growth, the prison  system, and the Constitution.</p>

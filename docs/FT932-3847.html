			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Rolls-Royce ceiling challenged AERO-ENGINE manufacturer Rolls-Royce attracted attention in an otherwise dull session, after stating that the level of foreign ownership of its shares had reached 29.5 per cent, the maximum permitted by the company's articles of association. The limit was raised to its present level in 1989. Buying from overseas investors has underpinned the share price in recent months, but henceforth any purchases from non-UK investors will have to be relinquished and transferred to UK ownership, as and when the company issues a notice. Market watchers suggested that with the stock still attractive to overseas buyers the present limit may soon be challenged by European Community investors as doubts remain about the definition of foreign ownership. There were suggestions that both Rolls-Royce and BAe, which has a similar ceiling, have been in discussions with the UK government about raising that limit to more than 40 per cent. The company said it would take no immediate action in the hope that its announcement would put a cap on any further foreign buying. It hoped the level of foreign ownership would soon fall to below the limit without it having to force overseas investors to sell. In yesterday's trading, Rolls-Royce added 2 at 152p in trade of 2.9m, with sentiment boosted by news at the Paris Air Show that it had won a Pounds 50m engine order to power 24 BAe Hawk aircraft.</p>

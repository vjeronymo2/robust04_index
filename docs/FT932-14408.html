			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / Seat freezes investment after fall into loss SEAT, the Spanish carmaker owned by Germany's Volkswagen group, suffered losses last year for the first time since 1988 after being hit by high debt servicing charges, a weakened peseta and a shrinking market. Mr Juan Antonio Diaz-Alvarez, chief executive, said the company would freeze a third of the Pta120bn (Pounds 682m) investments planned for this year and for 1994 and would shed 4,000 jobs from its 24,000 labour force. The Barcelona-based company reported after-tax losses of Pta12.7bn last year, against 1991 net profits of Pta2.4m. Mr Diaz-Alvarez said the shortfall, which had been anticipated, had been caused by financial charges totalling Pta16bn, accumulated from Pta400bn worth of investments over the past five years. Nearly half of Seat's investment to date has been financed by D-Mark loans and the German currency appreciated sharply against the peseta in the second half of 1992. Seat, which exports 80 per cent of the nearly 600,000 units it produces annually, did not benefit from the weakened peseta. The company's exports grew 23 per cent in the first half of last year when the currency was strong. But they fell 15 per cent, because of the depressed market, in the last quarter of 1992 after the peseta had devalued by 11 per cent against most European currencies. Mr Diaz-Alvarez said he expected car sales to drop during 1993 and Seat could at best hope to be breaking even at the end of the year. Car sales were up by a modest 4.7 per cent last year but the company's cashflow fell 59 per cent to Pta7.9bn following an investment outlay of Pta191bn in 1992, 56 per cent up on that of 1991. Under the reduced investment programme, Seat will be concentrating on a new version of the Volkswagen Polo model, built at the Spanish company's plant in Pamplona; on a bigger version of the Ibiza model, to be unveiled at next month's Barcelona motor show; and on a new small car being developed jointly with Japan's Suzuki group. Mr Diaz-Alvarez said part of Seat's industrial costs could in the future be passed on to suppliers under the strategy developed by fellow Spaniard Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, who recently joined Volkswagen from General Motors.</p>

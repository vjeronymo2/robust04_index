			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> FSIS Studies on TSP <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FSIS also conducted studies to determine the efficacy of TSP on raw, chilled poultry carcasses. <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  These studies show that the use of TSP on raw, chilled poultry carcasses results in statistically significant reductions in the levels of bacteria. Summary statistics of bacterial plate counts were used in all statistical analyses based on the arithmetic average and statistical significance was determined through nonparametric procedures using the relative rank of values. Analyses of 256 carcass-rinse samples collected at a federally inspected establishment over 4 days indicated that carcasses had average aerobe plate counts of 328 before TSP application, and 78 after application; Enterobacteriaceae counts of 25.5 before TSP application, and 2.7 after application; and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Escherichia coli  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> counts of 10.1 before TSP application, and 0.2 after treatment. Although these particular studies found no salmonellae in untreated or treated carcasses, preliminary results from industry group testing show that TSP is also effective in reducing salmonellae on raw poultry. Studies on moisture absorption resulting from the use of TSP found no inconsistencies with data furnished by the petitioner. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> A copy of the study results is available for public inspection the office of the FSIS Hearing Clerk. After carcasses had been chilled and hung on a moving shackle line, they were dipped for 15 seconds in an 8 percent) plus or minus 2 percent) TSP solution at a temperature of 7.7  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;C. (plus or minus 2  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;C.) (42  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F. to 49.5  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F.). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Food Additive Status <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> TSP is listed in the Food and Drug Administrated (FDA) regulations as generally recognized as safe (GRAS) for multiple purpose use in accordance with good manufacturing practice (21 CFR 182.1778). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA evaluated the petitioner's request for the use of TSP as a processing aid in poultry and concluded that the treatment leaves no residues on the product that could be harmful to consumers. Therefore, in an August 25, 1992, letter, FDA approved the use of TSP as a processing aid on raw poultry, under conditions to be established by FSIS. <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> A copy of FDA's approval letter is available for public inspection in the office of the FSIS Hearing Clerk. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> The Proposal <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Administrator has determined that (1) the use of TSP on raw, chilled poultry carcasses is in compliance with applicable FDA requirements, (2) its use is functional and suitable for the intended purpose, (3) the substance is used at the lowest acceptable level to consistently achieve the desired reduction of pathogenic bacteria as determined in specific cases, and (4) the use of this substance on raw, chilled poultry carcasses at the stated level will not render the treated product adulterated, misbranded, or otherwise not in accordance with the requirements of the PPIA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, FSIS is proposing to amend the poultry products inspection regulations at 9 CFR 381.147(f)(4) to add antimicrobial agents as a new class of substance for use on poultry products, and to add TSP as an approved antimicrobial agent. As requested by the petitioner, TSP would be permitted for use on raw, chilled poultry carcasses passed for wholesomeness at a level of 8 to 12 percent. The TSP treatment solution would be maintained at 45  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F. to 55  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F., and would be applied either by spraying or dipping the raw, chilled poultry carcasses for no more than 15 seconds. FSIS has determined, through review of the petitioner's data and its own study results, that 15 seconds is the maximum time necessary to coat all surfaces of the poultry carcasses with the TSP solution. FSIS is proposing the application of TSP by spraying, as well as by dipping, to permit the use of any existing spraying equipment in establishments, and thus reduce the costs incurred by establishments to set up the TSP treatment system. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although the use of TSP would not eliminate the need for continuing careful handling of raw poultry products, TSP treatment on raw, chilled poultry carcasses would reduce the levels of bacteria that may be present on raw poultry carcasses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> TSP leaves virtually no residue on or in the carcass of treated poultry that would require the labels of such treated product to show the presence of TSP. Therefore, poultry producers opting to use TSP would not be required to revise their product labels. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 9 CFR Part 381 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Poultry and poultry products. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the reasons set forth in the preamble, FSIS is proposing to amend the poultry products inspection regulations as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 381_MANDATORY POULTRY PRODUCTS INSPECTION <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / The cancer eating at Russia's heartland: At Chelyabinsk, in the Urals, Stalin and the communists created an industrial nightmare. They built their first nuclear bomb there - and they left a legacy of pure poison WHEN the plane landed and switched off its engines, the passengers remained seated and silent. No one rushed to the exit doors. No one dared to challenge the formidable hostess who kept order on the Aeroflot flight to Chelyabinsk, a sprawling, grim industrial city in the Urals which Stalin helped turn into a giant factory producing tanks  - and the first nuclear bomb. Then, one by one, we descended quietly into the cold but bright daylight. Immediately, we smelt the foul, polluted air. A couple of yelping mongrel dogs raced across the runway to greet us as we walked into the dilapidated terminal building. The local hospital was in no better shape. By the standards of others in the region, and in Moscow, District Hospital No. 1, near the centre of Chelyabinsk, was close to luxury. It was warm but the lifts were not working. The corridors were clean but the cardiographic machinery had broken down. 'We need new equipment if we are to save our patients,' said Vladislav Zakharov, a heart surgeon. He and his colleagues are paid about 1,000 roubles (Pounds 5) a month. A dozen pairs of disposable surgical gloves were drying on a window sill. The hospital has no money to replace them. The supply system, controlled in the past by the central authorities, had broken down completely. 'We wash the gloves out after every operation,' said Zakharov. The parents of tiny Susha Sineya were not worried about re-used surgical gloves. Their daughter, just six months old, had undergone a successful heart operation. 'A vessel was worn out,' Zakharov explained. Her parents live in Orsk, a military and industrial city in the south of the Urals. 'The air is bad in Orsk,' said Piotr Sineya, the father, who is a taxi driver. 'I suffer from headaches. But, otherwise, we are both healthy. When we take Susha home, though, we will face more problems. There is no baby food and no fresh milk. There are no guarantees that she will not fall ill again. There are no guarantees that the pollution will decrease.' In a nearby bed lay Jenni Chernyshova, a very small four-year-old who also had a heart operation. Her parents live in Orsk, too. Her father works at a military factory. Her mother suffers constantly from headaches. 'Each year, I carry out between 100 and 300 heart operations on people from Orsk,' said Zakharov. Chelyabinsk, like several other industrial centres in the Urals, was earmarked by Stalin late in the 1920s to produce weapons. Large factories, surrounded by walls and security watchtowers, were built. People could leave Chelyabinsk but few were allowed to visit this closed city of 1.5m people until it was opened to outsiders in 1990. The first reactor to refine plutonium was made at Chelyabinsk. 'This was in 1949,' said Alexei Kaunov, chairman of the regional authority's economic council. But in the rush to turn the Soviet Union into a giant super-power, safety standards were neglected. 'Stalin was in a hurry to get there first - he wanted to compete with the United States. The US was already ahead of us by about five years. They (the US) had the money. 'The authorities dumped nuclear waste into the rivers,' Kaunov added; that turned the nearby Techa river into a dead waterway. Over the years, he continued, 1.5bn curies (the quantity of radioactive substance that undergoes radioactive transformation) of plutonium had been stored, or dumped, in the region. Kaunov went on: 'In 1957, I was a 16-year-old geology student. I had been on a field trip. They had stored some of the plutonium in containers. One of the containers blew up. I saw the lights in the sky. For 30 years, nobody could speak about the accident. But everybody knew about it. Over 1,000 people had been exposed to radiation. That's why there are so many heart problems in this city. 'I remember another time. It was in 1964. Plutonium had been dumped in the Karachia lake, north of the city. It was sometime in July. That summer was very, very hot. The lake dried up. We could see the dust and the waste in the lake. They put concrete in the lake to cover up the waste. There are many other such incidents. Now, we have to try to dismantle our nuclear strategic weapons. What will we do with the waste?' That, Kaunov added, was still being dumped in Chelyabinsk. The regional authority is still run by the former communist nomenklatura - grey, elderly men who cling on doggedly to power and who, in a lengthy discussion about previous Communist party policy in Chelyabinsk, conveyed no sense of shame about what had happened in the past. 'I was not in power at the time,' said Piotr Necharev, head of the city council.' 'But you were on the central committee for years. Surely you knew what was happening, and how radioactive fall-out affected the health of the population. Did you never think of resigning? Necharev replied: 'I was first secretary of the city council during perestroika. I was not head of the party. Now, we will adopt more humane policies.' Colleague Vladimir Bagrinovtsev, a senior party member who himself had heart surgery two years ago, nodded in silent agreement. There is little sense of life along the highway north of Chelyabinsk. Swathes of tall, lean, coniferous trees are dead while the spring, late in coming, meant there was little fresh greenery to offset the dark, bleak terrain of the Urals' landscape. We turned off the main road, passed a poultry factory and headed down a mud track towards the village of Argayash. The air was cold and damp. Our eyes were sore. 'The steel mills have wrecked the air,' said Alexander, the driver. Faya, the 30-year-old manager of the local state-owned grocery store (which resembles an old, run-down dairy) said business was bad. The white, tiled walls were grey with age and neglect. Old pieces of cardboard were strewn across the stone floor to soak up the muddy boots of her few customers. The iron shelves were empty except for some tins of fish, preservatives, and bags of seeds. 'It was bad enough in the past, but at least we got a certain amount of supplies from the central warehouses,' said Faya. 'But now, with all the changes, the central supply system has broken down. We have to arrange our own transport to go into town and buy goods for the shop from certain warehouses. There is a shortage of petrol. Everything is very expensive.' Next door, Valentina, 43, was running the local state-owned remont shop, which carries out repairs and adjustments on clothes and shoes. The workshop was warm. Two other middle-aged women were using sewing machines which pre-dated the second world war. Valentina, a softly-spoken, melancholic woman, said: 'We are short of all sorts of things - thread, needles. Supplies are very irregular. During the old days of stagnation, at least supplies were stable.' Why did she and her colleagues not buy out the business? 'Even if we wanted to, we have no money. All our savings have been exhausted.' Despite this, she had few regrets about the collapse of the communist system although she stressed that she wanted the post-communist reforms to have some positive impact on the environment. She said the pollution and the radioactive fall-out of the 1950s probably were the reason she could not have children. 'I had an operation a few years ago - for cancer. The doctors said I could never have children. I still suffer from headaches and high blood pressure. You cannot even get fresh water around here. We boil it all the time.' She wiped away her tears. Dr Grigory Nikonov is director of a sanatorium, located in woodland about 20 kilometres from Chelyabinsk. 'Workers came here to convalesce,' he said. 'I remember some people from Chernobyl who were sent here.' He explained further: 'Those people who were treated here did not live around the Chernobyl plant. You know, they were sent from here - after the accident - to help with the clean-up. They were never asked. They were given no choice. We treated about 10 of those people here. They had clear signs of radiation  -baldness, headaches, weakness, digestive problems.' The small, clean sanatorium was built in 1927. 'It was needed even then. The air was already bad.' Nikonov said the wind sometimes blew a dry, dirty dust from the steel mills in the direction of the sanatorium. 'But even if the air had not been so awful, the workers would have been sent here in order to build up their strength. They lack nutrition. Their diets are terrible.' So far, the sanatorium has not had cut-backs, but Nikonov is not optimistic. 'I do not think the state, or the enterprises in the region which in the past subsidised us, will continue to do it in the future.' The same fear of fewer resources applies to the orphanage, which is only a short walk from the sanatorium. There, Boris Chernov, the manager, looks after 150 children. A third are from socially-deprived families, a third have been abandoned by their parents, and the others are there for health reasons. The children, aged between 11 and 17, were dressed in clean, navy uniforms. The day we visited the orphanage, some were planting flowers and seeds, others were playing in the corridors. They laughed excitedly when they heard a foreign visitor had arrived. 'Financing and obtaining supplies are the two most pressing problems we face today,' said Chernov, who has been director of the orphanage for two years. 'We are already beginning to lack the essentials - not only chairs and laundry but nutrition for the children, which they desperately need. I have no idea what will happen.' Back in Chelyabinsk, the reforms had failed to dislodge the babuska - those awesome, vigilant women who preside over each hotel floor. Ours asked for our hotel pass before she gave us our keys. A stocky, no-nonsense lady who, over the decades, clearly had been fed on a diet of starch, she could not explain why the bedrooms had no hot water, why cockroaches infested the bathroom, and why you could not get tea in the mornings. But, when asked, she promptly ordered a taxi to take us to the airport at 4 am the next day. Even at that hour, it was was pandemonium. Hundreds of people were milling around, waiting to buy non-existent tickets to Moscow - still seen as Russia's Mecca. The air was thick with the smells of dogs, stale vodka and sweat. Nor had the reforms managed to get rid of the special waiting room for foreigners - a world of incredible comfort far removed from the din, grime, and chaos of the rest of the terminal. It was certainly welcome - but also a place designed to give the unsuspecting foreigner a false sense of reality. We were ferried to the 'plane by special bus. Then, those hapless citizens of Chelyabinsk who had been lucky enough to secure tickets rushed across the runway and scampered aboard. When all the seats were filled, those without them (seat allocations are fictional on internal flights) stood near the main exit door, drinking beer and clinging on as the aircraft rose over the smoke-shrouded city and headed westwards.</p>

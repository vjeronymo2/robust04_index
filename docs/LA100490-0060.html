			<p><P> October 4, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> TRIAL OF REPUTED MOBSTER PETTI OPENS  </P> <P> The money-laundering trial of reputed mobster Chris Petti began Wednesday in  federal court with distribution to 100 jurors of a questionnaire that asked how  many people had heard of San Diego financier Richard T. Silberman.  </P> <P> The 18-page, 54-question form made no mention of Petti's reputed mob ties.  </P> <P> And prosecutors agreed Wednesday to avoid using words like "Mafia," "mob" and  "organized crime" when the presentation of evidence begins in the case --  likely next week.  </P> <P> Petti, 63, of San Diego, was charged along with Silberman in a seven-count  indictment on charges of laundering $300,000 in cash that an undercover FBI  agent portrayed as the proceeds of Colombian drug trafficking.  </P> <P> Silberman, 61, who served as an aide to former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr., was  convicted in June -- after a two-month trial -- of a single felony count, a  violation of federal currency laws. In August, he pleaded guilty to an  additional felony conspiracy charge, avoiding a second trial.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge J. Lawrence Irving sentenced Silberman last week to 46  months in federal prison. On Tuesday, Irving also imposed a $50,000 fine.  </P> <P> It was through Petti that Silberman was introduced to the undercover agent,  Peter Ahearn, who posed as Pete Carmassi, a front man for Colombian drug lords,  prosecutors contend.  </P> <P> Silberman's arrest actually resulted from a lengthy investigation by federal  authorities into Petti's activities. By October, 1988, FBI agents had been busy  for months investigating Petti and mob interest in gaming operations at the  Rincon Indian reservation.  </P> <P> That October, Silberman, who had known Petti for 15 years -- they first met at  a Mission Valley hotel barbershop -- asked him for help in finding people  interested in laundering cash, prosecutors contend.  </P> <P> Petti has pleaded not guilty to all seven counts.  </P></p>

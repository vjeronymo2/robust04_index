			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Landlords hold the key to easing rent burdens on shops: Incentives being offered to tenants FOR HARD-PRESSED retailers, the importance of Christmas is not just the seasonal boost to sales. It is also one of the year's quarter days, when rent falls due. This year, the strains on overstretched traders have been evident in their attempts to persuade landlords to relieve their rent burden for a temporary period. Many landlords are taking a sympathetic approach, as long as they had full access to the tenant's books and were convinced of the company's sincerity. 'We are doing a lot of deferment deals,' says Mr John Parry, managing director of Hammerson, one of the UK's largest property companies. 'We don't forgive rent but we will help tenants through a difficult cash flow period.' The most notable example is Ratners, the jewellery chain, which met with a mixed response from landlords when it asked to defer rent payments to finance its Christmas stock. Some believed it was worth helping the company out rather than being left with a lot of shops they were unable to let. Others were sceptical that a quarter's rent would be make-or-break for Ratners and wished to collect their debts while they could. As landlords grapple with record numbers of empty shops, they are watching the fortunes of traders with particular care. 'The pre-Christmas period is critical,' says Mr Parry. The landlords' concern about their unlet properties is prompting many to sign up retailers, typically selling items such as gifts, bargain books and cards, on leases of just a few months. 'The short-term letting market has been very buoyant indeed,' said Mr Graham Chase of Erdman Lewis International, the property advisers. The attraction for the tenant is that it can test the market and benefit from Christmas sales. The landlord benefits from a livelier shopping centre, reduced outgoings and the possibility that the tenant will decide to take a permanent lease. However, other tenants often object to the newcomers taking away their business, without supporting the overheads throughout the year. Even if retailers do well over the Christmas period, their landlords will have to work increasingly hard to stand still. Many empty shops have been filled with specialist retailers which have expanded with the help of rent-free periods and cash payments from desperate landlords - only to collapse when these incentives have run their course. By March quarter day, several more retailers are likely to disappear, regardless of the success of the Christmas trading period.</p>

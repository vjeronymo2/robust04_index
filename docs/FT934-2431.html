			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / Leading Article: No turning back in Russia Russia's election result has been greeted with dismay, even before it is fully known, by Russian would-be reformers and their friends in the west. This is because of the strong showing by Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky's ludicrously misnamed Liberal Democratic party, and by the communists, and the disappointing performance of the pro-reform parties associated with President Boris Yeltsin. Yet there may be greater cause for concern about the way Mr Yeltsin and his allies will react to the result than about the result itself. Mr Yeltsin has achieved his stated objective of winning popular approval for a new constitution which gives him extensive powers and severely restricts the power of parliament to prevent him using them. He now has the constitutional strength, and his incumbent prime minister, Mr Viktor Chernamyrdin, has already shown some of the political skills, required to manage a weak and fractious parliament. Their western friends must encourage them to persevere with reform, because only accelerated reform offers any hope of delivering the economic benefits which may persuade Russians to resist the siren songs of communist nostalgia and nationalist escapism. Russia's most crying needs now are for legislation which will allow it to attract foreign capital, for an effective privatisation of land enabling it to return to self-sufficiency in grain, and for basic institutional reforms allowing the government to control the money supply and ensure that real interest rates are positive. Mr Yeltsin now has the chance - almost certainly his last - to fulfil those needs. If he again hesitates in the face of opposition, as he has too often in the past, he will be lost. He would be especially unwise to seek to co-opt Mr Zhirinovsky, or to woo away his supporters, by embracing some of their truculent chauvinism towards the west and towards Russia's neighbours. To a limited extent he already tried that during the election campaign - but fascism thrives on appeasement, as history all too abundantly shows. By the same token, the west must be prepared to resist any argument that Russian appetites or neuroses should be indulged for fear of strengthening Mr Zhirinovsky's support. It should continue to support Russia's political and economic transformation - indeed should do so more effectively than hitherto, notably by opening its markets more readily to Russian products. But this can only be translated into support for Mr Yeltsin personally to the extent that he continues to act as the agent of that transformation, and if in foreign policy he shows full respect for international law and the integrity of Russia's neighbours. It should be made clear, in particular, that Russia has no veto over other countries' membership of western organisations. Nato membership cannot be extended lightly, and would in any case not solve the most immediate security problems of central and east European countries. But it is those problems - rather than the sensitivities of Russia's domestic politics, which remain hard for outsiders to predict let alone influence - that should be the determining consideration. The west can not afford to neglect the vital task of filling the security vacuum in central and eastern Europe by integrating it into the west European economy, and preparing the countries concerned for EU membership at the earliest possible date. It would be wrong to despair of a successful outcome to Russia's transition. The election result merely underlines dangers and difficulties of which serious observers were well aware. In response, the west must continue to strike a delicate balance between strengthening Russia's understandably nervous neighbours and working for the greater prize: a stable and prosperous Russia anchored by ties of permanent friendship to the west.</p>

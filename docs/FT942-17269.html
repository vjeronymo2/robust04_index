			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / Employers challenge strike ballots The National Communications Union faces legal pressure from the two main employers of its members - British Telecommunications and the Post Office - over the conduct of strike ballots. Post Office engineering staff in London voted last month by a small majority to take action over the proposed closure of about half the capital's mechanised letter offices. The Post Office subsequently questioned whether all the relevant people had been balloted and said it would seek an injunction to prevent action. It is going ahead with legal action in spite of assurances from NCU headquarters that no strike would take place. But recent industrial unrest in the Post Office among counter and delivery staff still looks set to spread to the smaller group of engineers. Post Office engineers voted 799-365 in favour of strike action to win guarantees that their pay and conditions would not be adversely affected when they moved from Royal Mail to RoMEC, a new subsidiary company. The Post Office offered them guarantees, but only for 18 months. The NCU has recently agreed to re-run a strike ballot of BT engineering staff in Stafford after BT declared it illegitimate. The result of an NCU ballot on action in the London area over BT's use of subcontractors is expected tomorrow.</p>

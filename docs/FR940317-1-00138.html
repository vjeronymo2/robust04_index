The Federal Claims Collection Act states that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal agencies will try to collect all claims of the United  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States for money or property. Among other things, it provides a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> basis for agencies to recover for damage to Government property.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Federal Medical Care Recovery Act (42 U.S.C. 2651&hyph;53)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (hereinafter ``FMCRA''). The FMCRA provides for the recovery of the reasonable value of medical care furnished by the United  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States on account of injury or disease incurred under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> circumstances creating tort liability upon some third person. The FMCRA is implemented by Executive Order 11060 and 28 CFR part 43; the Federal Claims Collection Standards (DA Pam 27&hyph;162, appendix M) also apply, as appropriate. However, some procedures appropriate for liquidated debts may not be appropriate for unliquidated claims.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) 10 U.S.C. 1095. 10 U.S.C. 1095 provides authority for military health care facilities to collect the reasonable cost of health care from health insurance and medicare supplemental policies. As amended by Public Law 101&hyph;510 (5 November 1990), this statute provides claims offices with additional authority to assert claims against automobile insurers for care provided in an MTF on or after that date.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Other authority.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) State Workers' Compensation laws.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) State hospital lien laws.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Contract rights under terms of insurance policies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including medical payment coverage, uninsured and underinsured  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coverages, and no-fault.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) State automobile no-fault laws.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

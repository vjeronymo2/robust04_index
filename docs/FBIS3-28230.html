The program, drawn up in response to criticism by Japan's  trading partners and applied to all government purchases, will  make it easier for foreign companies to bid for such contracts  through competitive bidding.    It is also aimed at improving cooperation and finding better  ways to handle complaints from foreign companies dissatisfied  with the procedures.    Under the program, foreign companies can make complaints  about all items procured by the government. The new steps will  also lower the minimum procurement limit from the current 1  million special drawing rights (SDRs), worth some 150 million  yen, to 800,000 SDRs, or 120 million yen.    Hosokawa will brief U.S. President Bill Clinton about the  new  measures when they meet in Washington on February 11.</p>

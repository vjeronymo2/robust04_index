			<p><P> July 23, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS  </P> <P> Forfeiture: Gov. Mario Cuomo was about to sign an asset-forfeiture bill along  the East River in Manhattan when a young woman in a passing motorboat did some  forfeiting of her own. As the boat passed the pier Thursday, the woman whipped  off her bikini. Cuomo said of the New York City borough where he grew up: "This  could never happen in Queens."  </P> <P> Masquerading: The owners of London's famous Harrods department store have filed  a $5-million lawsuit in Orlando, Fla., accusing a suspected thief of  masquerading as a member of their wealthy family. The Al-Fayed family filed the  suit against Mohamed Yehia Sead, claiming he has damaged the family name. The  Al-Fayeds say by using the name of businessman Mohamed Al-Fayed, Sead got  luxury service at the Ritz Carlton Hotel in Atlanta and carried out other  ruses.  </P> <P> Cell Shocked: Jailed civil rights leader Al Sharpton is angry about being put  in a cell recently vacated by one of the principals in the racially motivated  killing of a black youth. Sharpton, sentenced to 15 days for a 1988 protest he  led in New York City, was put in the Rikers Island maximum-security cell that  once housed Joey Fama, who was convicted of the murder of Yusef Hawkins.  Sharpton once led protests over the Hawkins slaying. A prison spokeswoman says  no offense was intended.  </P> <P> Intentions Test: A New York judge ruled that Donald Trump can be questioned by  attorneys for his estranged wife, Ivana, about an alleged extramarital affair.  Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Phyllis Gangel-Jacob ruled late last week that  Trump would have to divulge his intentions toward Marla Maples when he and his  wife updated a prenuptial agreement in 1987. Mrs. Trump said she would not have  signed the agreement -- giving her $25 million if she and Trump divorced -- had  she known of his "adultery and philandering."  </P></p>

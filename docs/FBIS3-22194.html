			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Veronika Romanenko under the heading ``Eco'': </F> ``View From the Ministry of Environmental Protection: The New  Year Will Be No Better'']    [Text] ``If one compares the current environmental  situation in Russia with 1992, one unfortunately find that it is  not improving and remains very acute,'' stated Viktor  Danilov-Danilyan, minister of environmental protection and  natural resources, who held a conference with selected regional  representatives at year's end.    Incidentally, it was noted that the drop in production also  has its positive aspects: there was a 12-percent decrease in  comparison to 1992 in pollutant emissions into the atmosphere  from ``stationary sources.''    Virtually all other pollution indices increased last year,  though only slightly. There was an increase in pollutant  emissions resulting from the use of low-quality types of  gasoline. For example, a Russian-made passenger car produces  almost as much pollution as seven U.S.-made automobiles (roughly  21 grams/kilometer per car, as opposed to 3 grams/kilometer for  an American car). More than 4,000 tonnes of lead-containing  compounds were released into the atmosphere. Direct  environmental damage as a result of these emissions is estimated  at more than R3.0 billion [rubles] annually.    The results of observations by experts carried out in the  atmosphere around Russia's cities and industrial centers  indicates an increase in concentrations of carbon monoxide,  carbon disulfide, phenol and nitrogen oxides. During the first  half of 1993 a total of 207 cases of maximum permissible  pollutant levels being exceeded by factors of 10 or more were  reported in 44 cities around the country. There were 88 reported  incidents of massive one-time air pollution. According to  environmental protection agencies, the damage done by air  pollution alone was R280 million in the first six months of 1993.    According to the minister the condition of fauna has also  worsened. Populations of many valuable animal species have  dropped to dangerously low levels, and fish catches are down as  well. The reason is habitat exhaustion, as well as a marked  upsurge in poaching.    Another equally important problem for ecologists is  emergencies caused by natural disasters and manmade accidents.  1993 witnessed many such incidents. One need only recall the  accident at Tomsk-7 in April, the flooding in the Urals, and the  numerous explosions in transportation systems and at a number of  mines.    A lack of funding and a wide range of other reasons do not  permit the minister of environmental protection to hope that the  situation will begin to improve in the near future. In Viktor  Danilov-Danilyan's opinion, the task for 1994 will be ``at the  first stage, at least to halt the worsening of the environmental  situation.''</p>

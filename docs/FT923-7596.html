			<p>920817 FT  17 AUG 92 / International Company News: BP continues restructure of chemicals BP CHEMICALS continued the restructuring of its petrochemicals operations with the announcement of the proposed sale of its low density polyethylene plant at Antwerp. Neste Chemicals, the acquisitive state-owned Finnish group, is to buy the 120,000-tonne-a-year operation. Terms were not disclosed. However, with low density polyethylene prices at about DM1.17 a kilo, the plant's turnover would be about DM140m (Pounds 49.6m). It makes tubular polyethylene for wire and cable insulation and packaging materials. BP Chemicals said the sale was part of its efforts to focus its polyolefins operations on areas of competitive strength. The company would concentrate on ethylene derivative production where it could use cheap gas rather than naphtha feedstocks. It is currently building a 330,000-tonne-a-year plant at its Grangemouth complex. The company said the sale would have no effect on the south Wales Baglan Bay ethylene plant that supplies the Antwerp polyethylene business. A transitional agreement has been agreed between the groups so that BP Chemicals will supply ethylene for two years. Industry observers believe an option exists for the company to close a 120,000 tonne train at the Baglan Bay site. There is another 210,000 train there. As many as 120 workers have already been made redundant. Neste, Europe's second largest polyolefins manufacturer, already has a joint venture with Petrofina called FinaNeste which has more than 1m tonnes ethylene capacity at Antwerp. The group also has polyethylene plants in Finland, Sweden and Portugal. BP Chemicals said between 250 and 300 of its 900 staff at Antwerp would transfer to Neste as part of the deal. A further 100 jobs would be lost. In a separate deal, Neste is also buying BP America's performance polymers business at Hackettstown, New Jersey. Its 40,000 tonne a year plant makes polyethylene and other polymers and employs 125 people, all of whom will transfer to Neste. Financial details were not given. The sales follow BP's announcement earlier this month of a strategic alliance with Enichem of Italy in styrene and polyethylene.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The part numbers of the rules generally track the Tribunal's original structure (parts 301&hyph;311), and are redesignated parts 251&hyph;259 of the Copyright Office's rules. Two parts of the Tribunal's former rules, parts 303 and 305 relating to jukebox performances, are being repealed since their relevance has been eliminated by the Reform Act's repeal of the jukebox compulsory license.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The main task of today's proposed rulemaking is to provide the substantive changes in the former Tribunal's rules necessary to implement the Reform Act and to create a workable and efficient system for adjusting royalty rates and distributing royalties. The following is a part-by-part summary of the proposed changes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Part 251_Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panels Rules of Procedure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Part 251 is a proposed revision of part 301 of the former Tribunal's rules, which covered most of the Tribunal's operating procedures and rules of practice. This is the part that is in greatest need of revision, since many of the rules are inappropriate to govern the new system of ad hoc Arbitration Panels. The following summarizes the proposed changes in the various subparts of part 251.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Subpart A_Organization  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Subpart A of part 251, entitled ``Organization'' and describing the composition of the Copyright Royalty Tribunal, was rendered superfluous by the Reform Act. Since it is necessary to create a completely different organizational scheme to implement the new system, we are planning to repeal all of subpart A and to substitute completely new provisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Official Address. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Part 251.1 provides a single official address for all proceedings and actions conducted under subchapter B. Establishment of an official address is important, since many sections of subchapter B refer to this section or require documents to be filed at this address, including all royalty claims, requests for information, public access to documents, payments of Arbitration Panel costs, and motions, objections, and records filed with the Panels. Moreover, since all records submitted to the Copyright Office, to the Library, and to the CARPs are, with limited exceptions, available to the public for inspection and copying, a single address is required to assure that all documents will be assembled in a single location for the convenience of those wishing to inspect them. We also believe that providing a single permanent repository for all documents created and submitted under subchapter B is not only important, but required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All this may seem self-evident, but there is a problem here. Unlike the proceedings of the Tribunal, arbitration proceedings will not necessarily take place at a single location, within the Library of Congress or elsewhere. There may be incentive in particular cases for parties to deliver filings directly to the actual location where the CARP is meeting, but we believe it would be a mistake to allow entire filings to go to locations different from the mailing address specified in these proposed regulations. Any possible advantages of such a system to the parties or the Panels would be outweighed by the dangers of confusion among parties to different proceedings and possible uncertainties and difficulties in mail receipt and delivery. Since individuals' rights often depend on the timely filing and delivery of papers, the guarantee of proper handling can only be afforded by delivery to a single address in the Copyright Office of the Library of Congress.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At the same time, while section 251.1 creates a single official address, section 251.44 provides the parties flexibility in submitting documents and filing papers. In cases where an Arbitration Panel is conducting a hearing, the arbitrators are directed to establish requirements permitting delivery of filings directly to them, as long as one copy of the filing is delivered to the Copyright Office at its official address.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Purpose of the CARPs. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Section 251.2 describes the purpose of the Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panels: to make rate adjustments and/or royalty distributions for the cable (17 U.S.C. 111), mechanical (17 U.S.C. 115), jukebox (17 U.S.C. 116), public broadcasting (17 U.S.C. 118), satellite carrier (17 U.S.C. 119) and digital audio recording devices and media (17 U.S.C. chapter 10) licenses. The jurisdiction of the Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panels is more limited than that of the Copyright Royalty Tribunal which, for example, had authority to adjust the royalty maximum for digital audio recording devices. This adjustment is now the province of the Librarian.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  17 U.S.C. 1004(a)(3). There are also certain arbitration procedures in the Copyright Act which are not within the jurisdiction of the CARPs.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  17 U.S.C. 119 and 1010.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> List of Arbitrators. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Reform Act provides that the selection of arbitrators for a Royalty Panel must be made from ``lists provided by professional arbitration associations.'' 17 U.S.C. 802(b). Sections 251.3 and 251.4 govern the creation and use of those lists. Before the beginning of each year (and, in the case of the current year of 1994, before March 1), any professional arbitration association or organization may submit a list of its member arbitrators who would be qualified to serve on a Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel. Specific information is required with respect to each person whose name is submitted, including current and past employment, educational background, and a description of the facts and information that would qualify the person to serve as an arbitrator. After receiving the lists, there will be an initial screening process in which the Librarian will determine: 1) if the proposed person meets the necessary qualifications to serve as an arbitrator; and 2) if that person can reasonably be expected to be available during that calendar year. The names of persons meeting the requirements will be published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  at the beginning of each year (in the case of 1994, by March 1), and this publication will serve as the master list from which the Librarian can select names for any arbitration proceeding commencing in that calendar year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Objection Procedure. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Librarian will screen the master list, and there is also a procedure for objection. The objection procedure is confined to the period before an individual arbitration proceeding begins, and is limited to the parties participating in that proceeding. In the case of rate adjustment proceedings, parties may file their objections during the 90-day ``cooling off'' period following the filing of petitions for adjustment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  &sect;251.63. In the case of distribution proceedings, objections must be filed during the precontroversy discovery period specified by &sect;251.45(a). Objections must clearly spell out the facts and reasons for disqualification of persons on the arbitrator list, and the Librarian will consider them during the selection process for the first two arbitrators. Once the Librarian has made his selections, the objections will be made available to the two arbitrators to assist them in their selection of the third arbitrator. No peremptory objections will be allowed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

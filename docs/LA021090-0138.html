			<p><P> February 10, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE OIL SPILL?  </P> <P> Shoppers at South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa were asked at random Friday for  their thoughts on the disaster involving the tanker, the American Trader, and  the spill of 300,000 gallons of crude oil into the ocean off Huntington Beach.  </P> <P> GAIL L. NICORA  </P> <P> 37, of Santa Ana, a collection coordinator for a pharmaceutical company, says:  </P> <P> "We'd like to know why they had to unload that tanker when the swells were  high. . . . "  </P> <P> JANE C. SCHATTKE  </P> <P> 29, of Laguna Nigel, a chemist:  </P> <P> "It's careless. . . . It's the consumers who pay in the end, and the  environment as well."  </P> <P> MARIO J. CASSAR  </P> <P> 20, a diamond consultant and model from Huntington Beach:  </P> <P> "There's a lot of wildlife gone already. And that's not fair. I think we should  keep the ocean clean."  </P> <P> CHARLES V. HICKEN  </P> <P> 54, a professional fund-raiser from Sacramento:  </P> <P> "I think they ought to assess the heaviest fines they can. . . . (But) how do  you levy a fine against such enormous wealth? It means nothing. I don't know  what they can do. But they ought to do something."  </P> <P> PHILIP CHAMPLIN  </P> <P> 50, a Superior Court judge in Napa:  </P> <P> "I think they're probably going to have to start double-hulling ships. It just  points out the vulnerability of the fleet. The potential of devastating the  shoreline of a tourist area like this points out the need for greater  precaution."  </P> <P> SUSAN J. MIRSHAHZADEH  </P> <P> 37, a mother who lives in Anaheim:  </P> <P> "It's disgusting. . . . I think it's disgusting in general with what they're  doing with the ecological system of this planet. It's just another example.  We're making the world uninhabitable."  </P> <P> BOB W. NICORA  </P> <P> 50, of Santa Ana, who works in research in a pharmaceutical company:  </P> <P> "It seems as if the oil companies haven't developed the contingency plans to  make sure these spills don't happen. . . . And I think the government hasn't  stepped in."  </P> <P> JEFF B. THOMPSON  </P> <P> 25, of Huntington Beach, an account representative for a Seal Beach printing  company he said has sent 25 employees to help with the cleanup:  </P> <P> "It's pretty horrible. But I think it's neat to see all the support the  community is giving."  </P></p>

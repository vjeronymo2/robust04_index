			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Kuwait to push for Opec quota boost KUWAIT IS expected to push hard for a higher production ceiling at the next meeting of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, a move that is causing tension between ministers and could shake the oil market out of its current balance. Mr Ali Ahmed al-Baghli, Kuwait's oil minister, has this week been stressing the emirate's demands for a higher quota with his claims that output will reach between 2.2m and 2.4m barrels a day by the end of June. Industry experts dispute Kuwait's capacity growth figures, saying production should reach 2m b/d by late June, but that level is significantly higher than present output of 1.75m b/d. Opec has successfully managed to fine-tune the market in the past two months by trimming its output to 24.1m b/d in April (according to the International Energy Agency, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's oil market monitoring body). Although this is some 500,000 b/d above its overall production ceiling it is in line with demand, which has been rising slowly. However, producing countries are now delivering their opening gambits before next month's ministerial meeting while traders watch nervously, ready to push prices downwards at any sign of increased tension. 'The apparent stability in the market is due to totally confused signals that are being given out by different sectors,' said Mr Vahan Zanoyan, senior director at Petroleum Finance Company, the oil consultants in Washington. Oil demand is growing, particularly in the Far East. The IEA said in its April oil report that it expected demand to rise by 1.5 per cent or 500,000 b/d in the second quarter. That is tempered, however, by continuing news from Russia of declining production. The latest reports in Russian newspapers have pointed to a drop in output in the first quarter of 15 per cent to 610.7m barrels from 718.4m barrels in the corresponding period of last year. Mr Geoff Pyne, oil analyst at UBS, believes that Russia will have to begin cutting back on exports to the west this year as output declines further. He expects exports to drop to an average 1.1m b/d from 1.4m b/d last year. On the back of an increase in demand and continuing falls in production in Russia, Opec will be able to justify an increase in its ceiling to about 24.6m b/d at its June meeting. That would represent a rise of about 500m b/d compared with the present output level. Kuwait will argue for a substantial share of that increase as it continues its recovery from the Gulf war, but its demands will be strongly countered by Nigeria and Iran which are also looking to raise output. Improved relations between Kuwait and Tehran have led to rumours of a deal being arranged between the two to carve up any increased quota, but Saudi Arabia would also want its share of any rise in the ceiling. Mr Daniel Yergin, head of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, says the market is still dominated by Opec's 'triangle of contention', between Saudi Arabia, Iran and Kuwait, all of which are anxious to capture market share before Iraq re-enters.</p>

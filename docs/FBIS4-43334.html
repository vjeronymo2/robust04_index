			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Backing Brittan"] </F>   [Text] During Jacques Delors's long tenure of the European  Commissions presidency, that office has become vastly more  important to the daily lives of 340 million Europeans. It is  therefore of utmost importance that his successor has a vision  of Europe in tune with the post-Maastricht mood of its  inhabitants.    The two leading contenders are Jean-Luc Dehaene, Prime  Minister of Belgium, and Ruud Lubbers, former Prime Minister of  The Netherlands. The contest has become more than just a  question of competence, personality and political weight: it is  now seen as the weathervane of the European Union's [EU] future  direction. But the chances of agreement being reached by the 12  heads of government at their forthcoming meeting in Corfu are  not good.    To Britain's dismay, Mr Dehaene has been the favourite.  Arguments claimed in his favour include his record of  competence during last year's Belgian EU presidency, an ability  to compromise, an outlook relatively free of socialist  dogmatism. But he is also a federalist of the old order. Being  Belgian, he will find it hard to distance himself from the  Establishment of Brussels, and is ill-placed to respond to  demands for regionalism, subsidiarity and a cutback in  interference by unelected bureaucrats. Above all, he is the  candidate that France and Germany have attempted to impose by  diktat.    France has an unreasonable desire for another French-speaker  at the head of the Commission at a time when it sees four  naturally anglophone members are about to join; Helmut Kohl has  turned against Mr Lubbers for no better reason than personal  dislike. Even if Mr Delors's successor must be chosen by secret  manoeuvring rather than open ballot, this degree of manipulation  should not be accepted. Even more insulting is the open talk of  compensation jobs -- not in any European leaders gift -- for  defeated aspirants.    Mr Lubbers is better qualified for the job than Mr Dehaene.  Support for him may prevent the immediate imposition of Mr  Dehaene at Corfu. But it will probably lead only to stalemate.  Of the other candidates, Peter Sutherland, a forceful former  Irish Commissioner, has attracted considerable support. But Sir  Leon Brittan, the EU Trade Commissioner, is without doubt the  best qualified prospective successor to Mr Delors. A French  speaker, a superb negotiator -- a GaTT treaty would have been  impossible without him -- and a skilful diplomat who has  re-established relations with southern countries upset by his  firmness as former Competition Commissioner, he combines the  liberal free trade ideas with commitment to a Europe that is  open and decentralised.    Given the Prime Minister's reputation in Europe and the  fiasco of Britain's performance over voting rights, British  support for Sir Leon will not be enough. It is therefore up to  other countries to recognise that he would best take Europe in  the direction most of their voters want. The French have a  critical role here; their divided government must ask itself how  much it really want a president as federalist as Mr Dehaene.  Though the tide in the European Community remains unfavourable  for antifederalists, no opportunity to shift it a little nearer  to thinking which could be embraced by French Gaullistes no less  than British Euro-sceptics should be squandered.</p>

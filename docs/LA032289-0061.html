			<p><P> March 22, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> The Internal Revenue Service has abandoned a policy under which employees were  told not to notify taxpayers who inadvertently overpaid their income taxes,  acting Commissioner Michael J. Murphy said. The change was announced after a  meeting with Sen. Albert Gore Jr. (D-Tenn.), to whom some employees of the IRS  service center in Memphis had complained. Those employees said the old policy  amounted to the IRS's stealing from taxpayers -- most of whom apparently were  pensioners. In addition to dropping the old policy, Murphy and Gore said, the  IRS will make provisions for taxpayers who inadvertently overpaid their 1985  and 1986 taxes to file amended returns.  </P></p>

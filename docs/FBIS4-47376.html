			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by V. N. Aleksandrov; UDC 528.93:516] </F>   [Abstract] Traditional mapping, data collection and  processing must give way to computerization and far-reaching  automation in order to meet the modern needs of the Russian  economy. Geoinformation systems are a point of departure and  this concept must be further developed; in particular,  integrated regional geoinformation systems are needed. One  aspect of related work is digital mapping. In 1992 a federal  digital mapping program was organized in Russia which was  collated with 28 ministries and departments. It is planned that  in 1994 work will be completed on the preparation of digital  maps at 1:100 000 for the whole of Russia and by 1994-1996 the  same will be done at 1:200 000 for the most important regions.  There is a real market for these maps. In the future it is  planned that topographic maps at all scales will be converted to  digital form. All this will facilitate automation of processes  involved in the production of thematic and special maps. The  same procedure will be applied in urban and land surveys. These  are but the first steps, for example, in ensuring effective  ecological monitoring and territorial inventorying of natural  resources. The maintenance of regional databanks is a priority  task, revision must be on a frequent basis and an  ever-increasing number of procedures must be automated. The many  related problems involved are discussed. The introduction of  geoinformation systems must proceed on an accelerated basis,  accompanied by an increase in the productivity of labor by a  factor of 5-7. Digital cartographic information must be  organized and managed by federal agencies with long-term funding  and a uniform quality control must be introduced and  implemented. The information system must be organized on the  basis of a decentralized model which takes into account the  participation of all interested organizations in use of this  information and all users must have equal access.</p>

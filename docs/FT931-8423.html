			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Curious facts behind the figures The unemployment total is now higher, in absolute terms, than it was at the pre-war peak in January 1933 of 2.97m. Unemployment is higher in London than in Scotland and Wales combined. A government survey found 55 per cent of the unemployed in London and the south-east ready to accept a job paying less than Pounds 175 a week. 2m new jobs will be needed between now and the end of the decade if unemployment is to fall back to the 1990 level of 1.6m.</p>

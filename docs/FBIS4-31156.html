			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, 6 Jun--Writing in the NOWA EUROPA daily,  Industry and Trade Minister Marek Pol has announced plans to  create special economic zones in this country. In his view, the  creation of the first zones will ensue toward the end of this  year, following the appropriate legislative process. Alongside  the so-called multifaceted zones, in which we will be  particularly concerned to attract investors with large projects,  we wish to have zones oriented toward certain specific areas of  activity, the minister announced. It will not be the level of  investment that is most significant, but the content--that is to  say, the know-how, the technological value of the project, and  so on.    According to the head of the Industry Ministry, neither a  lower nor a higher value threshold for investment capital is  being set. On the other hand, the quality of the investment, the  level of employment, and the ecological character of the  investment will have a particular significance. As he revealed,  the Mielec area is being considered, among others, inasmuch as  it is one of the originators of this idea and an area that  fought for it, and, in general, those areas in which there are  concentrated large, unexploited assets; for instance, those for  the reconstruction of the nuclear power station in Zarnowiec.    According to the minister, there is considerable interest  among foreign investors. The greatest number of offers comes  from the United States. There are also many proposals from  Germany, Italy, France, and the Polish capital.</p>

			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / International Company News: SBC wins direct control of BSI SWISS BANK Corporation, Switzerland's second biggest bank, yesterday effectively took direct control of Banca della Svizzera Italiana (BSI), the sixth biggest. SBC took over the 36.5 per cent of the BSI capital, carrying 49.8 per cent of the voting rights, which Unigestion, the Geneva-based finance company, had acquired last year in a deal through which SBC ended up holding nearly half the Unigestion stock and exercising indirect control over BSI. Unigestion has ceded the BSI stock to SBC in return for 150,000 of its own registered shares held by SBC. In addition, the Unigestion management acquired 55,000 bearer shares in Unigestion from SBC, which retains a 14 per cent stake in the finance company. This exchange of shares in effect ends the adventure on which Unigestion embarked in 1988 when, together with Mr George Klein, the New York real estate developer, it bought a 49.9 per cent interest in BSI. Last year, Unigestion bought out Mr Klein with the help of a loan from SBC and a capital increase which more than doubled its equity and left SBC with almost half its stock. Unigestion said shareholders' equity had grown from SFr490 per share before the BSI stock purchase in 1988 to SFr900 as a result of the latest transaction. The deal would allow it to repay the whole of its SFr378m (Dollars 270m) debt, strengthen its treasury and concentrate on the financial services in which it specialises. It planned to simplify its share structure over the next few weeks. Italian share stake, Page 30</p>

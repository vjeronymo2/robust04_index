			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / LWT managers likely to receive Pounds 55m payout: Broadcasting union attacks 'obscene' share scheme MANAGERS AT London Weekend Television seem likely to hit the biggest jackpot yet in British television history with a payout worth more than Pounds 55m that will create 15 millionaires. Under a management option scheme linked to share performance, Sir Christopher Bland, chairman of the ITV station, stands to make a gross profit of more than Pounds 7m in September, the trigger month for the scheme. Mr Greg Dyke, LWT chief executive, Mr Ron Miller, sales director and Mr Brian Tesler, former chairman, are each likely to get more than Pounds 5.3m. Ironically if Mr John Birt, BBC director-general, had stayed at LWT, he would have had more than Pounds 5m in shares instead of a BBC pay package of just Pounds 200,000 a year. Sir Christopher denied yesterday that the scheme was too generous to management. 'It's an outstanding reward for outstanding performance,' he said. Since the scheme was launched, LWT has been the top ITV performer on the Stock Exchange and 10th in the All-Share Index. The millionaires-to-be at LWT extend beyond the top echelons of management. Mr Melvyn Bragg, the author and head of arts at LWT, and Mr Nick Elliott, director of programmes, are likely to get more than Pounds 2.2m. Others to benefit will include Mr Derek Hemment, sales manager; Mr Robin Paxton, controller of current affairs; Mr Mike Southgate, managing director of the London Studios, and Mr Barry Cox, director of corporate affairs. The payouts have only become possible because LWT retained its ITV franchise in the 1991 competitive tenders with a low bid of Pounds 7.58m a year and has cut costs since. The aim was to tie managers to the company during the franchise period. Other LWT staff did not get special payments for retaining the franchise, although there is a company profit-sharing scheme. Special payments at Scottish Television, which retained its franchise with a bid of only Pounds 2,000 a year, totalled less than Pounds 2m. Some winning ITV companies made no special pay-ments. The LWT scheme, which prompted controversy among a number of institutional shareholders at the time, dates from a 1989 capital restructuring when the company gave existing shareholders 130p a share paid out of company resources and debt to reduce the equity base by two thirds. At the same time, 44 managers were able to subscribe for unlisted management shares at 83.2p - to be paid for in cash or by rolling up the proceeds of an existing share scheme. A number of thresholds were set for converting the management shares into multiples of ordinary shares. To trigger the maximum payout of 4.048 ordinary shares for every management share, the LWT share price has to hit an average 278p in the 20 business days after this September's announcement of half-year results to June 1993. Yesterday the LWT share price reached 392p as confidence continued to grow in the prospects for a recovery in television advertising. Last month Bectu, the broadcasting union, compiled the gross profit for the 44 LWT managers when the share price stood at 385p - a figure that would give Sir Christopher a gross profit of Pounds 7,091,342. The lowest figure is Pounds 73,750. Yesterday Bectu described the management share scheme as 'obscene'. See Lex London stocks, Page 44</p>

			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / Imports rise by 3% in March IMPORTS rose by more than 3 per cent last month to Pounds 9.4bn, providing further support for theories that the recession might be close to reaching a trough. The increase, from a seasonally adjusted Pounds 9.1bn in February, is a sign of a pick-up in demand from consumers and industrial groups. Exports rose by more than 1 per cent last month, from Pounds 8.3bn in February to Pounds 8.4bn in March. The figures for the value of imports and exports are both down by 3 per cent over the first quarter of this year, compared with the final three months of 1990. Compared with the January-March period last year, imports in the first quarter of 1991 were down 10 per cent, while exports showed a reduction of 1 per cent. The Central Statistical Office bases its judgments on longer-term trends in the balance of payments on the figures for visible trade, not counting oil and erratic items such as ships and precious stones. It said yesterday that on the basis of those statistics there were clear signs that the underlying rate of fall in imports had slackened in recent months. The CSO is assuming a surplus of Pounds 500m in each of the first three months of 1991 in invisible trade - services, financial payments and government transfers. This may be revised when the government issues new estimates for the first quarter invisibles balance.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                      CURRENT ACCOUNT (Pounds bn)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------              Current             Visible Trade               Invisibles              Balance    Balance     Exports     Imports         Balance  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 1989           -19.9      -24.0        92.8       116.8            +4.1 1990           -12.8      -17.9       102.7       120.6            +5.1 Qtr 1           -4.8       -5.9        25.4        31.2            +1.1 Qtr 2           -4.7       -5.3        25.9        31.1            +0.6 Qtr 3           -2.4       -3.7        25.6        29.3            +1.3 Qtr 4           -0.8       -3.0        25.9        28.9            +2.1 1991 Qtr 1           -1.4       -2.9        25.1        28.0            +1.5 Jan             -0.8       -1.3         8.3         9.6            +0.5 Feb             -0.2       -0.7         8.3         9.1            +0.5 March           -0.4       -0.9         8.4         9.4            +0.5  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Invisibles for Jan to March 1991 are projections.

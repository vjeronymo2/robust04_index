			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / Survey of Japanese Industry (3): Concern mounts over moves to shift production overseas - Foreign Takeovers and Investments The truth is that there is no work left any more,' moans Mr Masao Saito, head of the International Technical Business Association, which is helping a group of small and medium-sized Japanese companies from Gumma prefecture to set up operations together in an industrial park in China. The decision by these small companies to combine forces and move to China reflects the desperate situation they face as their traditional customers, the larger Japanese manufacturers, transfer more of their production overseas. The sharp rise of the yen since the beginning of the year has meant that hardly a day goes by without one Japanese company or another announcing a new investment or expansion of already existing facilities abroad, particularly in Asia. In the mid to late 1980s the move by Japanese manufacturers to set up operations overseas was considered a political necessity. Words such as globalisation and local procurement became corporate mantras and Japanese foreign investment reached Dollars 67.5bn in fiscal 1989 alone, according to Ministry of Finance statistics. Overall, recent Japanese investment overseas has tailed off since then as most of the companies that needed to have established a presence in key markets outside of Japan and as the plunge in asset prices and slowdown of the Japanese economy has dented corporate profits. The level of investment overseas declined to Dollars 34.1bn in the last fiscal year. But with the yen's rise, overseas investment has once again become a necessity for the corporate survival of many manufacturing companies for economic rather than political reasons. The moves to shift production overseas, coinciding this time with a recessionary environment and worries about rising unemployment at home, have raised concerns that Japan's industrial competitiveness will be undermined by the move of jobs and technologies overseas. 'If the yen continues at this level, we may have to move more production overseas,' warns Mr Tsuzo Murase, executive vice-president of Matsushita, the consumer electronics company. But the company is considering its moves cautiously because of the need to maintain jobs at home, he notes. Others, such as Aiwa, a medium-sized specialised audio company, have transferred the bulk of their manufacturing overseas in an attempt to survive the impact on its costs of the high yen. The yen's rise is not just encouraging the shift of production to lower cost bases such as south-east Asia. The need to reduce costs substantially in order to maintain cost competitiveness has also led to increased purchases of components from cheaper sources outside Japan. As the yen climbed from an exchange rate of Y124 to the dollar at the beginning to the year to Y115 to the dollar by April, imports of major electronic components and equipment from Asia, including China, have surged. In the first six months of the year, the dollar value of imports of office machinery from China tripled from the same period in the previous year while that of electronic components more than doubled, according to statistics from the Ministry of Finance. From member countries of the Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean), then, office machinery imports rose 80 per cent while that of electronic devices increased 27 per cent and the picture is similar for imports from the newly industrialised countries. Many Japanese computer makers have begun to procure some models in their PC line-up from lower cost sources overseas. Matsushita, for one, has set up a special unit to concentrate on procuring components from cheaper sources abroad. These moves may help to maintain the competitiveness of the large manufacturers but the worry is that they are hurting the vast number of Japanese component makers which have been a crucial factor behind the country's industrial might. As one Japanese manufacturer after another moves production overseas or looks outside of Japan for cheaper parts, Japan's small and medium-sized suppliers have been left behind to watch the industrial landscape at home being transformed by the manufacturing exodus. Some, such as the electronic components maker Sanritsu, which has seen a large proportion of its business evaporate with the decision by its parent company to procure parts from cheaper sources in Asia, are being forced to close factories. Even the more fortunate suppliers are being encouraged to diversify and reduce their traditional reliance on the parent company. Nevertheless, despite growing signs of pressure on Japan's myriad suppliers, opinion is divided over whether the current trend will eventually lead to a hollowing out of Japanese industry. The doomsayers who believe jobs and manufacturing technology are moving out of Japan, point out that the need for large manufacturers to shift production overseas in order to remain competitive means that their suppliers must also either move out of Japan or face consolidation. Against those concerns, the optimists say that investment overseas by Japanese companies has not risen so dramatically as to warrant concern. They also argue that Japanese industry has been shifting to more value-added products to make up for the gradual loss of commodity manufacturing to overseas industries. 'Japan has a high level of technology and education, so I am not worried about hollowing out,' says Mr Atsushi Kameno at the Ministry of Labour. Japanese manufacturers - faced with the dilemma posed by, on the one hand pressure to shift more production overseas and, on the other, the need to maintain a strong manufacturing base at home - have generally kept to a policy of shifting low technology production overseas while gradually moving the emphasis of their businesses to higher value-added products. They are also being forced, during the current squeeze on costs, to focus their energies and their R&amp;D funds even more than before on areas which they have defined as key technologies. Many electronics companies, for example, are increasing investments in liquid crystal displays and other key devices which are expected to see growing demand with advances in information technology. If the current environment encourages such concentration on winning technologies it may help, rather than weaken, the ability of Japanese companies to come up with high value-added products to replace commodity manufacturing. That in turn would help maintain Japan's industrial progress.</p>

			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Tribals win long autonomy struggle Jharkhand, a mineral-rich region of Bihar, India's second most populous state, is to be granted wide autonomy, marking a breakthrough in a 50-year struggle for self-determination. An agreement this week between the central government and the state of Bihar, provides for establishment of an autonomous council in Jharkhand, the southern half of the state. It is by far the largest Indian region to be granted such status; most previous cases have involved small pockets of tribal land. In a campaign which pre-dated the end of the British Raj, a separate identity for Jharkhand had been sought by the area's aboriginal peoples, but backing had also come from some industrial houses. They argued that the Bihar administration, based in Patna, the state capital to the north, had long neglected their needs while reaping tax benefits from their activities. Successive state governments of different political hues are said to have built a bureaucracy on the back of revenues from mining and industry, almost entirely concentrated in Jharkhand, while Bihar is India's poorest state. The estimated 40m people of Jharkhand will now gain their own assembly, with Bihar entitled to nominate 10 per cent of its members. The new entity is expected to control sectors such as agriculture, education and health. Northern Biharis appear reconciled to the break, which some see as a prelude either to full statehood for Jharkhand or it turning into a union territory dealing direct with Delhi. A Bihar government official said the tribal south had long enjoyed special status and state income would not be affected. But the move may encourage further development in Jharkhand, which apart from coal, bauxite and copper has a prime deposit of mica, a substance with applications in computer technology.</p>

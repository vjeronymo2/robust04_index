			<p><P> December 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'PREEMIE' SURVIVAL LAGS, COULD STIR ABORTION DEBATE  </P> <P> There has been little improvement over the last seven years in the survival of  the smallest and most premature babies, according to a study published today  that may stoke the debate over the ethics of second-trimester abortions.  </P> <P> The study found that about one in five infants born before 25 weeks' gestation  -- or weighing less than about 26 ounces -- survived between 1985 and 1988.  That rate was no better than the survival rate of similar babies born between  1982 and 1985.  </P> <P> That rate was unchanged despite increasingly aggressive attempts to keep such  newborns alive, the researchers found. But the average time until death rose  from 73 hours to 880 hours among those infants transferred to neonatal  intensive care.  </P> <P> "Thus, although survival has not appreciably altered, in some instances we  further postponed death by the futile continuation of respiratory support," the  authors wrote in a paper published in the New England Journal of Medicine.  </P> <P> The findings, from Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in  Cleveland, add new data to the debate over fetal viability -- the critical  point at which an infant could survive outside the womb and at which the state  may intervene to block an abortion.  </P> <P> But the findings also raise questions about the ethics and economics of going  to great lengths to salvage tiny infants unlikely to live: Amid attempts to  control health care expenditures, is it right to try against the odds to save  those babies?  </P> <P> "This is a cutting edge issue," said Dr. Ezra Davidson, chairman of the  department of obstetrics and gynecology at Drew University in Los Angeles.  "(It) really poses a lot of ethical and medical problems in making a correct  and comfortable decision."  </P> <P> The researchers, Maureen Hack and Avroy A. Fanaroff, compared the cases of 98  infants weighing less than 750 grams, or 26.4 ounces, delivered at McDonald  Hospital for Women between mid-1982 and mid-1985, to 129 similar infants  delivered between 1985 and 1988.  </P> <P> The infants in the first group had been born after an average of 24.2 weeks'  gestation. The average in the second group was 23.5 weeks. Babies of that  weight and prematurity represent about 0.5% of all babies born in the United  States, physicians said.  </P> <P> The survival rate in the early 1980s was 20%. In the latter period, it was 18%.  The rates were basically unchanged despite the fact that the percentage of  infants resuscitated rose from 38% to 47% and the rate of Cesarean sections  rose from 12% to 19%.  </P> <P> (Physicians say Cesarean sections may be used in these cases in hopes of  protecting fragile infants from the trauma of vaginal delivery. But the  procedure pits the surgery risk to the mother against the benefit to an infant  unlikely to survive.)  </P> <P> "Thus, despite a tendency to perform more Cesarean sections and active  resuscitations, no improvement in the survival of babies with lengths of  gestation below 25 weeks or birth weights under 750 grams was observed," the  researchers wrote.  </P> <P> They said the probability of survival was even worse in the case of infants  born after less than 24 weeks' gestation and weighing less than 600 grams.  </P> <P> The researchers also tracked the development of some of the babies up to 20  months after birth. They found that four out of 18 studied in the first group,  and seven out of 14 in the second group had "moderate-to-severe  neurodevelopmental impairment."  </P> <P> The impairment ranged from blindness to paralysis and abnormal development of  tissue.  </P> <P> Because of the small numbers involved, the researchers were cautious about  drawing conclusions from that sample. But they described the "trend toward an  increase" in handicap "of serious concern."  </P> <P> Asked Wednesday about the findings, opponents of abortion emphasized the fact  that one in five infants had lived. They also noted that one infant survived  after just 22 weeks' gestation -- two weeks less than the 24-week minimum often  cited for viability.  </P> <P> Supporters of the right to abortion emphasized the finding that survival among  infants born at less than 25 weeks had not improved. They said that confirms  their current position that viability generally occurs after no less than 24  weeks.  </P> <P> The issue is considered significant because the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in  1973 that the state's right to regulate abortion -- by intervening to protect  life -- begins at the point of viability. The court estimated that a fetus  could survive after 24 weeks.  </P> <P> "Here, they had a 22-weeker," Dr. John Willke, president of the National Right  to Life Committee, said in a telephone interview Wednesday. "To all those  distinguished scientists with their absolutism, well, say no more."  </P> <P> "The one-in-five rate doesn't change my thinking or feeling about late  second-trimester abortions," said Barbara Radford, executive director of the  National Abortion Federation. "I do think it's really interesting that the  survival rate hasn't changed in that decade."  </P> <P> Others, however, said the study's significance extends far beyond abortion.  </P> <P> Al Jonsen, a professor of ethics in medicine at the University of Washington  School of Medicine, said the findings raise the question of whether the science  of saving premature babies has perhaps reached "some sort of physiological  lower limit."  </P> <P> The barrier to survival may no longer be simply the traditional problem of  insufficiently developed lungs, he said. It may now be what Jonsen called "a  complex of physiological under-development" and "the illness of not being  finished."  </P> <P> Jonsen said the findings raise two related, but separate, ethical questions:  </P> <P> "Is it justifiable to continue research into salvaging babies at the lower end  of the scale?" he wondered. "What about rescue efforts? Can we legitimately  exclude the whole class of babies under a particular weight and gestational age  from therapeutic rescue efforts?"  </P> <P> The study's authors suggested their findings would be useful in guiding health  care providers and administrators in making medical policy decisions, and also  in counseling parents with "unrealistic expectations" about the ability of  medicine to keep alive an immature infant outside of the womb.  </P></p>

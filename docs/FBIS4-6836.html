			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 23 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam  almost suffered a heart attack when he saw the early editions of  Friday morning's newspapers and felt another palpitation while  watching the evening news on Thursday. He immediately ordered  Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang to toe the line. This is what led to  Yi's dismissal.    Local newspapers and TV news all reported Yi's remarks, made  through his secretary, pointing out the operational and  technical problems of the Unification-security Policy  Coordination Committee. President Kim had personally formed the  committee to erase any images of dissent within the government  on unification and security. But his prime minister, supposedly  the No. 2 man, challenged the president by pointing out problems  with the committee.    How could a prime minister dare announce such opinions  through a secretary, couldn't you wait until our regular meeting  tomorrow, what did you hope to gain by having your words carried  in the newspapers?, Kim probably yelled at Yi over the telephone.    Such anger revived the president's memory: The violence at  the Chogye temple broke out while I was away: I had to order a  thorough investigation because the prime minister failed to take  charge, Kim most likely muttered to himself.    Kim's ire apparently hadn't died out Friday afternoon when  the two men sat down for their regular briefing session. But  instead of apologizing, the prime minister only said he had  acted on behalf of the country and the president, behavior  deemed consistent for a former judge nicknamed "Bamboo" for his  strict adherence to the law.    So, if we follow the law as you say, who should be  responsible in case of a power vacuum? Isn't it the prime  minister?, Kim probably said, clearly indicating that he planned  to fire Yi. Yi got the message and handed in his resignation as  soon as he returned to his office.    Kim's aide said the president was surprised when Yi walked  into his office Friday afternoon without a letter of resignation  after what happened the previous evening. Although the move was  certainly unexpected to many, insiders had actually been  predicting it for a long time.    Yi, they say, put the brakes on many of the orders that came  from the presidential office. For instance, Kim said dismissing  his Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Minister Kim Yang-bae  was inevitable because he revised South Korea's Uruguay Round  country schedule despite promising the president he wouldn't.    The prime minister challenged this thinking, insisting that  the country schedule was not revised in any way but only  "appeared" to have been changed. Yi asked the other cabinet  ministers to emulate him and pay less attention to the  presidential office, telling them he would take the  responsibility when meeting with the press.    On some occasions, he bluntly told Chief Presidential  Secretary Pak Kwan-yong not to meddle and issue orders to the  cabinet, they say. Yi may wish to call it a resignation, but  considering the prior series of events, "fired" is the correct  term.</p>

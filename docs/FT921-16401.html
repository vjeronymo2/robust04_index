			<p>920103 FT  03 JAN 92 / United Telecom to buy final 19.9% of Sprint for Dollars 530m GTE, the largest local telephone company in the US, is to sell its remaining 19.9 per cent stake in Sprint, the nation's third biggest long-distance carrier, for Dollars 530m (Pounds 283m) to United Telecommunications, which already owns 80.1 per cent of the company. The deal, announced yesterday, marks the end of a five-year partnership which began in 1986 when GTE and United Telecom, which both have substantial local telephone interests, combined their long-distance and data communications interests into a single organisation, with each holding a 50 per cent stake. However, joint ownership produced considerable strains and hampered Sprint's development. In 1988 United Telecom took over management control of the business and bought a further 30.1 per cent from GTE for Dollars 600m. GTE, which has made clear over the past two years that it intended to sell its remaining interest, had an agreement under which it could have required United Telecom to buy the stake at book value from the start of this year. However, yesterday's agreement was negotiated separately from that so-called 'put' option. United is paying a discount to the book value of the stake, which stood at around Dollars 560m at the end of September, while GTE will benefit by not having to arrange the financing for United's purchase, as was required under the 'put' option agreement. GTE is believed to have held discussions last year with some European carriers, including Cable &amp; Wireless of the UK, about selling the Sprint stake. However, any such deal would have required the approval of United Telecom, which had always made clear it wanted 100 per cent ownership. United now intends to change its corporate name to Sprint, which is more widely known to the US public thanks to its national presence and strong marketing effort. After a rocky start, Sprint now holds some 10 per cent of the US long-distance market and has developed a reputation for technological innovation, although its revenues and profits are currently being hit by recession. United Telecom will pay Dollars 250m in cash on completion of the deal, expected at the end of this month, and the remainder in cash on July 1. It aims to finance the deal with a combination of short and long-term debt. Lex, Page 10</p>

			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Yen climbs sharply on package THE YEN appreciated sharply against the dollar in European trading yesterday, breaking through the important Y105 barrier, as dealers took the view that Tokyo's latest economic stimulation package would disappoint the US, writes James Blitz. Since August 19 the seven-month-long rise of the yen had been halted, amid signs that the US government had been mollified by the prospect of a big fiscal boost. The Federal Reserve's intervention on that day made dealers think the Clinton administration was no longer seeking a dollar depreciation in an attempt to reduce the Japanese trade surplus. Yesterday's package was a less powerful stimulus than many dealers had expected. The headline figure for the package, at about 6 trillion yen, was larger than had been anticipated, and the Japanese authorities claimed it would put 1.3 percentage points on gross development product. But there was no specific promise from the Japanese authorities to reduce income tax and there was no cut in the official discount rate. Comments from US officials were far from hopeful that pressure would come off the Japanese authorities. In the European afternoon, Mr Ron Brown, US commerce secretary, said the administration had expected that a bigger stimulus would be forthcoming. Earlier in the day an unnamed official had been quoted as saying that the proposed package would fall far short of what was needed to boost the country's economy. After closing at Y106.25 per dollar on Wednesday night, the yen broke through the Y105 level and closed in London at Y104.40. A dealer suggested that the yen could now break through the Y100 level for the first time. In New York the yen finished at Y104.22. At the start of US trading, the dollar weakened sharply against the D-Mark, falling as low as DM1.5875, after US indicators showed that the country's trade deficit was still very high. The data showed that the trade deficit remained at a sizeable Dollars 10.34bn in July. But there was strong buying of the dollar at this level, as US fund managers entered the market, buying the US currency at what they clearly perceived was a very cheap level. The dollar ended in London at DM1.6065, against a previous DM1.5930, and in New York it closed at DM1.6037. In Europe, sterling fell sharply following a very strong attack on Mr John Major's leadership in two articles written by Mr Norman Lamont, the former UK chancellor. The currency was also undermined by figures which showed the second consecutive monthly rise in unemployment. Both pieces of news raised speculation that the British government might again be moved to cut UK base rates, either at the time of the Conservative party's annual conference or in Mr Kenneth Clarke's first budget. The pound closed at DM2.4625 from a previous DM2.4725.</p>

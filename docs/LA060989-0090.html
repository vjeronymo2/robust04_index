			<p><P> June 9, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> McCaw Wants Lin to Halt TV Spinoff: McCaw Cellular Communications, which  announced this week that it is bidding $6.5 billion for Lin Broadcasting, said  the offer for its rival was conditioned on Lin halting its planned spinoff of  seven broadcast television stations. In a filing with the Securities and  Exchange Commission, McCaw, the nation's largest cellular telephone company,  said the spinoff would "materially reduce the value of the company's common  stock outstanding" and incur substantial costs. If Lin carries out the planned  spinoff, McCaw said it would either reduce its $120-a-share offer for the  broadcasting and cellular communications company or withdraw it altogether.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Following the announcement of the arrival in  Bosnia-Herzegovina of a new contingent of Russian troops, Alija  Izetbegovic, president of the Bosnia-Herzegovina, today sent a  letter to Yasushi Akashi, the UN secretary general's special  envoy. The letter reads:    Esteemed Mr. Akashi, the behavior of Russian soldiers on  their arrival in Sarajevo caused dissatisfaction among the  citizens, and -- I believe -- damaged the reputation of the UN  mission in Bosnia-Herzegovina. On their arrival they  demonstrated support for the aggressor and behaved in a way  which reminded us of some earlier ugly periods. Our people took  all this as a provocation which could have turned into an  incident.    Bearing this in mind, it is my duty to inform you that we do  not agree to the arrival of more Russian troops in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. We believe that decisions to this effect  should be postponed. We ask you to inform the competent UN  officials about our position on this issue, Alija Izetbegovic  says in his letter.</p>

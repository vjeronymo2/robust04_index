			<p><P> October 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ABORTION DEBATE AT STATE LEVEL  </P> <P> I read with interest Carol McGraw's article ("Abortion Protest Cases May Swamp  Courts," Metro, Oct. 3) but unfortunately it totally misses the point. Our  criminal justice system is already swamped, and every day dangerous felons are  either never arrested or never brought to trial because of this.  </P> <P> The real question in the light of this situation is how Los Angeles police  found the time to make over 800 arrests, while using arm-breaking force, of  peaceful demonstrators and how the prosecutor's office finds the time to try  each case. Either a judgment has been made that those who would peacefully  sacrifice their personal freedom to save the lives of innocent babies represent  more of a threat to you and me than the car thieves and drug pushers who they  could have jailed otherwise, or the radical pro-abortionists who dominate our  local political establishment are out to punish their opponents and make us all  pay in the process. Which do you think is more likely the case?  </P> <P> GREG FRY  </P> <P> Culver City  </P></p>

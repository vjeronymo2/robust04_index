			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Gains for yen and US dollar THE YEN and dollar recorded gains yesterday against other major currencies, as foreign exchange markets paused for breath ahead of tomorrow's meeting of the Bundesbank council, writes Peter Marsh. The D-Mark ended an edgy but quiet day in European trading narrowly down against both currencies. Sterling continued its recent descent against the D-Mark but at a slower pace, as buying support began to pick up around the DM2.85 level. Talk of an increase in German rates after the Bundesbank meeting continued to dominate the markets. However, some traders speculated that the central bank might confine itself to action short of a rate rise, a measure which would have a relatively mild effect on the currency markets. Such theories bolstered the previously sagging dollar, and supported the pound. Mr Mark Brett, a Barclays de Zoete Wedd currency specialist, said: 'Few people in the currency markets are prepared to push off into new territory ahead of the Bundesbank meeting.' The yen, which has been a prime beneficiary of the weaker dollar, gained against the D-Mark after a Bank of Japan official was quoted as saying the yen was too weak against the German unit. At the close of London trading, the D-Mark was quoted at DM11.91 per Y1,000, against DM11.83 at the previous close. The German currency lost ground against the dollar to end at DM1.4900, compared with DM1.4780 on Monday night. Against the yen, the dollar edged forward to Y125.00 from a previous finish of Y124.95. Later in New York the US unit finished at DM1.4855 and Y125.20. The dollar also gained against the pound, which continued its recent soggy performance. At the close, sterling was quoted at Dollars 1.913, as against Dollars 1.9295, while in terms of the D-Mark the pound lost 1/4 pfennig, closing at DM2.85 after at one stage hitting a low of DM2.8464. Some dealers took the view that the worst for sterling might be over and that, at yesterday's levels, the currency looked cheap. However, news of a 0.6 per cent reduction in UK manufacturing output in May, compared with April, did little to increase the confidence of the markets that a significant economic recovery was about to start. By the close of European trading, sterling was securely pinned as the weakest member of the exchange rate mechanism, with a divergence to its central Ecu rate of 56 per cent. Meanwhile, sterling may have received support from comments by Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, that his government will support the pound at its current DM2.95 central rate, even if it means UK interest rates going up. Mr Major made his approach clear in meetings yesterday with other ministers.</p>

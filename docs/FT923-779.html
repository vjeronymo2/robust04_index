			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: The importance of preparing for the day when you retire - Planning Your Pension By the time you retire, it is possible that your pension, and not your house, will be your greatest single asset. However, few people understand either how much they have invested, or how much they are entitled to invest. Over the coming weeks, the Weekend FT will publish a series of articles to explain your entitlements, and the different bodies which could provide a pension. If you want to take advantage of the full Inland Revenue tax benefits for long-term pension saving there are three choices of provider: the government, your employer, or a personal pension via an independent fund manager or insurance company. This first article explains the pension provision available from the state. THE STATE will support you in your old age - but that support is designed to fund fish and chip suppers rather than haute cuisine. And even the limited state pension system faces horrendous problems as the average age of the population increases. These problems are so big that the government has been offering incentives for investors to opt out of the state scheme. All of which goes a long way to explaining why pension planning is so important - and so difficult. The state's pension provision comes in two layers: the 'basic pension' and then, for some, the 'additional pension' - known to most as Serps (the state earnings-related pension scheme). The government then provides tax reliefs of varying sizes to allow companies and independent providers a chance to compete. To take the two tiers in turn: Basic pension Everyone who pays the full rate (Class 1) National Insurance contributions for most of their working life is eligible for the basic pension, and the payment of NICs is compulsory for those who are employees. Some women still pay the reduced rate of NIC, which does not give them a right to this pension. The self-employed build up a right to the basic pension through paying Class 2 NICs. The rules governing the basic pension are as follows: 1. It is paid weekly (as are contributions) and rises in line with retail price inflation at the beginning of each tax year, The present pension is Pounds 54.15 for a single person. 2. It is paid only when a man has reached 65 or a woman 60. You cannot take a basic state pension if you retire from your job early but you can defer taking it until 70 for men and 65 for women. 3. For married couples, if one partner retires and the other is not working, an extra Pounds 32.55 is paid. If that partner is over the relevant retirement age, it will go to them direct - otherwise, it goes to the partner who has reached retirement age. One further complication: if you retire but your partner is still working, then the extra pension is not payable until they do retire. The maximum a household can receive under this system is a less-than-princely Pounds 86.70 per week, or Pounds 4,508.40 in a year. Additional pension Whether you are in Serps might well depend on your employer. Large companies tend to 'contract out' and provide their own pension scheme. But many small companies cannot afford the commitment of funding their own pension scheme, so rely on Serps to do the job for them. Self-employed people do not have the option of Serps. So, if you work for a company and have not signed up for a 'contracted-out' pension scheme, you are contributing towards Serps by default. Whether you should be doing so is another matter. The basic promise of Serps is to pay 20 per cent of your average earnings as a pension once you have retired. These are adjusted for inflation, and include every year between the age of 16 and state retirement age. Thus, under the present system, a man needs to start work at 16 and pay National Insurance contributions for 49 years to be entitled to the full Serps pension. Employers also pay NICs on their employees' behalf towards Serps. The scheme has become a political football, though. When introduced under Labour in 1978, it offered to pay an income of 25 per cent of the average of the 20 highest-paid years of employment. But there are complications. Ammendments introduced by the Conservatives in 1988 are being phased-in gradually over 49 years. Those retiring on or before the 1998-99 financial year will have their pension based on the more generous Labour system. Anybody reaching retirement age after 2037-38 for men, or 2032-33 for women, will be on the new system. All those who fall in between will be paid their pension via a hybrid system. A further qualification is that the earnings to which the scheme is related are not total earnings but only an employee's earnings between two strict bands. The lower earnings limit is Pounds 54 a week while the upper limit, or 'cap,' is Pounds 405, equivalent to Pounds 21,060. Even if you earn Pounds 100,000 a year, your entitlement will be worked out on the assumption that you earn Pounds 349 a week (the difference between upper and lower limits). Similarly, those paid under Pounds 54 a week have no access to Serps. Finally, if you were working between 1961 and 1975, you might qualify for a small 'graduated pension' worth up to Pounds 5.50 a week. This system was replaced by Serps. As with the basic scheme, Serps' pensions cannot be taken until 60 for women and 65 for men. Pension payments then are index-linked. Serps can thus be described as a safety net - although barely adequate  - for those who are employed and cannot be bothered to take any action over their pension. NICs to fund it are not tax-deductible and income tax is payable in the usual way on the pension you get in retirement. So, this arrangement has no claim to 'tax-efficiency' and does nothing for the self-employed. Many people effectively will contract-out of Serps when they sign up for a company pension scheme. If you do not belong to such a scheme, but still leave Serps, the government automatically will pay money into an appropriate personal pension set up by an insurance company or fund manager (of which more later in the series). Contracting-out is done year by year, so you can contract back in. Then, when you retire, you would be paid income in differing proportions by the government (for the years when you were contracted-in) and by the personal pension provider. Ultimately, Serps should be regarded only as a very basic building block for your pension. You need added options, which we start to cover next week. But even with the vast funds at its disposal, the problems the government has in funding pensions should make painfully clear that planning by the individual is not easy.

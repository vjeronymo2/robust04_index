			<p><P> June 24, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A GOOD IDEA GONE SOUR: CAN BANK INSURANCE FAIL?;  </P> <P> BANKING: STEP ASIDE, SAVINGS AND LOANS. PROBLEMS WITH INSURANCE FOR COMMERCIAL  BANKS MAY CAUSE ANOTHER CRISIS. THIS TIME, IT MAY BE WORSE.  </P> <P> The collapse of the savings-and-loan industry is already the most costly  regulatory failure in the world. But even as that crisis unfolds, another is  looming: Federal insurance of bank deposits, once considered an American  birthright, may now be a luxury we can no longer afford.  </P> <P> The $500-billion price tag on the bailout of the Federal Savings and Loan  Insurance Corporation is bloating the federal deficit, fueling inflationary  pressures and putting upward pressure on interest rates. The government fire  sale of thrift assets is also wreaking chaos on real-estate markets.  </P> <P> So far the problem has been isolated, in the relatively obscure S&amp;L  industry. But the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's program at the  nation's 14,000 commercial banks is identical to the system used for insuring  S&amp;Ls -- a system we know doesn't work.  </P> <P> In fact, banking experts are now predicting the imminent collapse of the  insurance fund that backs the commercial banking industry. Commercial bank  failures are on the rise while the FDIC's losses are at an all-time high, and  their loss reserves at near-record lows. The bankruptcy of the FDIC's insurance  fund would be a body blow that even the resilient U.S. economy could not  withstand. Economic collapse could ensue.  </P> <P> There is a certain irony in all this. After all, the original purpose of  federally-backed insurance for deposit accounts -- one of the proudest legacies  of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal -- was to prevent bank failures by ensuring  public confidence in the banking system. But government mismanagement of the  deposit insurance system has created a set of perverse incentives that have  fostered bank failures by encouraging irresponsibility and excessive  risk-taking on the part of bank shareholders, management and boards of  directors. Far from curing the bank failure disease, government-backed deposit  insurance has only masked its symptoms while the disease itself was growing out  of control.  </P> <P> The basically sound idea has been twisted by regulatory irresponsibility and  ineptitude. Federally backed deposit insurance was supposed to instill public  confidence in the banking system by assuring depositors that the money they  have in their bank accounts will be available when they need it. Because banks  keep less cash on hand than is necessary to meet their obligations to  depositors at any given time, in the absence of deposit insurance, there is  reason for depositors to worry.  </P> <P> Banks typically keep a high percentage of their liabilities in the form of  demand or near-demand deposit accounts. But banks do not keep depositors' money  in their vaults. They invest it in long-term, relatively illiquid assets such  as commercial loans and mortgages, keeping only a fraction in cash on hand at  the bank to meet depositors' needs. Consequently, all depositors cannot get  access to their funds simultaneously. If they tried, even the healthiest bank  would be unable to liquidate its investments in time to meet its obligations to  all of its depositors. Normally, all depositors will not want all their cash at  the same time. But in a world without deposit insurance, depositors know they  can get their cash only if they are among the first through the door during a  panic, avoiding the possibility of finding the bank's cash reserves depleted by  others who got there first.  </P> <P> Without deposit insurance, the me-first mentality can also be triggered  whenever depositors believe their bank has made bad investments and may not  have enough money to pay off all depositors in the future. Banks are vulnerable  to rumors about panics and insolvency because depositors can withdraw their  money and shift it to other banks easily and quickly. The solution to this  problem was federal deposit insurance, which eliminates the incentives of  individual depositors to withdraw their funds from banks on the basis of  rumors, because depositors know the government will back the obligations.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, embedded within the deposit insurance concept are the seeds of  its own destruction. Deposit insurance makes people see little difference  between putting their money in banks that are well run and others that are not.  </P> <P> To make matter worse, deposit insurance gives bankers incentives to gamble  depositors' money on excessively risky projects. Normally, any investor,  including depositors, will demand to be compensated for investing in high-risk,  high-return projects. But depositors will not demand such a "risk premium" if  their investments are protected by the federal government. This allows bankers  to make excessively risky loans without having to pay higher interest rates to  attract depositors. With deposit insurance, the banker who invests in safe  investments with low rates of return must pay the same to attract deposits as  the banker who invests in risky projects with high rates of return. If these  projects do not pan out, the government is left holding the bag.  </P> <P> This problem would be easy for the government to correct. By charging banks a  fee for deposit insurance based on the riskiness of their activities, banks  would have an incentive to make safer investments with depositors' funds.  </P> <P> But deposit insurance has been transformed from a program to protect depositors  into a program that protects banks. Poorly run banks, like other poorly run  businesses, should be allowed to fail. And when a bank fails, the FDIC should  handle the problem in the way Congress envisioned when it enacted the Federal  Deposit Insurance Act in 1935. It calls for insolvent banks to be closed and  liquidated while insured depositors to be paid off promptly and in full.  Depositors with accounts in excess of the $100,000 limit on insured deposits  are to become general creditors of the failed bank.  </P> <P> Instead, government bailouts of failed banks have become the norm. Banking  regulators gradually have expanded depositor protection to include even the  largest, most sophisticated depositors.  </P> <P> This misguided policy has its origins in the decision of the FDIC to bail out  the Continental Illinois bank in 1984. The FDIC decided that it could not let a  bank as large as Continental go under because of the ripple effect that would  have on the rest of the economy. The result was that all depositors -- even  those with deposits well in excess of $100,000 ceiling -- were covered. The  government announced that some U.S. banks simply were too large to fail.  </P> <P> Soon, principles of fairness and equal treatment for banks of all sizes led the  FDIC to promise to bail out all depositors. The size of the bank did the  matter. The results have been catastrophic.  </P> <P> The solutions to the current mess are simple. The government should require  banks to purchase highly liquid short-term assets so that short-run liquidity  crunches will not automatically induce bank failure. The government should vary  the price for deposit insurance on the basis of risk. Finally, insolvent banks,  regardless of size, should be liquidated.  </P> <P> These changes would protect the public not only from the social costs of bank  failures, but also from the social costs of federally funded deposit insurance.  </P></p>

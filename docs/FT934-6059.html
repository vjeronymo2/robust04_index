			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: BPB Industries The ripple of excitement in building materials stocks caused by BPB's profits resurgence will provide comfort for those who have bid up the sector by more than 90 per cent since sterling's devaluation. Throw in the latest base rate cut and encouraging building figures and it is even tempting to see scope for further outperformance. Yet in believing this, the market is overlooking some immediate worries. The threat of the chancellor putting the hobnailed hush puppy into social housing and local government spending should at least occasion some pause for thought. There is also a danger of generalising from the particular. Several special factors have aided BPB. The plasterboard war, which devastated prices, has abated and margins are rebounding faster than they will in other sectors. Moreover, BPB has had greater opportunity to cut costs, given its history as a flabby monopoly producer. The 15 per cent rise in German plasterboard volumes confirms the strength of that market. Then again, the shares of RMC and Redland should have already discounted as much. The big question for BPB will be whether it seeks to diversify in order to smooth its volatile earnings stream. The group's strong cash generation, which is rapidly eroding gearing, is creating the opportunity. But any such plans seem to have perished with the abrupt departure of the chief executive in September.</p>

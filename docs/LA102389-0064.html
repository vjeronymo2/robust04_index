			<p><P> October 23, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> MOUNTAIN BOYS FEUD WITH MAFIA IN 'NEXT OF KIN'  </P> <P> In "Next of Kin" (citywide), Patrick Swayze plays Truman Gates, hillbilly cop  in Chicago, hunting for the big-city Mafia varmint who killed his kin and  trying to ward off the even more dangerous vendettas of his other backwoods  brother, Briar (Liam Neeson).  </P> <P> It's the Mafia vs. the Mountain Boys, with Fish out of Water, Feudin' and  Fussin'. This collection of marketing hooks was strung together by two writers,  Michael Jenning and Jeb Stuart, who seem to have done most of their research on  rural America and big city crime by watching old Walter Hill movies.  </P> <P> To call this story a collection of hackneyed stereotypes would be complimenting  it. "Next of Kin" doesn't have the logic of a good cliche. After a fairly good,  tense opening, it keeps rolling up one preposterous scene after another: wild  man Briar's one-against-a-dozen antics as he challenges the Cosa Nostra on  their own stomping grounds; lone studs swaggering into dangerous locales and  challenging everybody; Michael J. Pollard's cuddly grimaces as an inexplicably  friendly hotel clerk; the Three Stooges antics of a clownish Mafia hit man;  bizarrely loose-mouthed killers confessing everything over vino and tape  recorders, and Truman's unusual relationship with his classical violinist wife,  Jessie -- who plays fiddle in the hills and leaves the country folk rapt with  wonderment.  </P> <P> In the long-suffering but competent cast, Baldwin is memorably nasty as the  chief killer and Neeson has appropriated a set of vocal inflections that, on  closer inspection, seem to be Ben Johnson's. Director John Irvin gives it all a  patina of quality, including smoky Steven Poster cinematography that suggests  Vilmos Szigmond with his glasses fogged, and a pump-them-up score by Jack  Nitzsche.  </P> <P> If this machismo-tipsy movie were a little sillier, it might qualify as a  classic of dumb camp. By the end, when we discover that the feudin' cousins and  the fussin' Cosa Nostra are all basically good old boys -- or maybe "good old,  good olds" -- and also that you can blow away half of Chicago and stage a  massacre in a graveyard without even waking up the neighbors, you may be ready  to break out the moonshine or break out of the movie theater. Either one is  preferable to watching "Next of Kin" (MPAA rated R for violence).  </P></p>

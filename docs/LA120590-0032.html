			<p><P> December 5, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: DAIRY QUEEN, ARMED WITH BLIZZARD, HOPES TO SCOOP S.D. ICE  CREAM MARKET  </P> <P> At last, an economic trend to cool the mouth and warm the heart.  </P> <P> Dairy Queen, the royalty of ice cream sellers elsewhere in the country, has  begun a gung-ho assault on San Diego County.  </P> <P> Two years ago, there were but two local Dairy Queens: Lakeside and North Park.  </P> <P> Now there are 10, heading to 30 or more by the end of next year. Coming soon to  a shopping center near you, mostly in North County.  </P> <P> For half a century, Dairy Queen has been a part of rural Americana: summer  nights, a double scoop of soft vanilla dipped in chocolate, a former homecoming  queen working behind the counter.  </P> <P> But now International Dairy Queen Inc. of Minneapolis isn't content with 5,206  stores worldwide and 48% of the domestic market.  </P> <P> It wants to bust into suburbs, heretofore the turf of Baskin-Robbins and  designer ice creams. It figures the market is poised for a backlash to  Haagen-Dazs, a flight from Frusen Gladje, a return to the heartland.  </P> <P> Enter Bruce Hungate, a Dairy Queen brat (mom and dad own a Dairy Queen in  Tucson) turned "urban territory operator" for San Diego County.  </P> <P> He started a Dairy Queen in Solana Beach two years ago. Since then he has found  franchisees for Dairy Queens from Pacific Beach to Oceanside.  </P> <P> He says he's got a secret weapon: the Blizzard, a scoop that can be smothered  with all manner of delectables like crushed Oreos, shredded Butterfingers, and  more.  </P> <P> "The Blizzard is the key to the yuppie market," Hungate said. "It's the biggest  thing to hit Dairy Queen since the invention of the cone."  </P> <P> The franchise-holders in the Carmel Mountain Ranch Town Center are James and  Solan Ni. I stopped by to research the product.  </P> <P> The Nis also run a Baskin-Robbins in Mira Mesa. They arrived in San Diego seven  years ago from Taiwan.  </P> <P> Several of the Dairy Queen franchisees are recent immigrants who have decided  their road to the American Dream is paved with ice cream. That's another trend.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Home Front Violence  </P> <P> Men, women and animals.  </P> <P> * Title of a keynote address this morning at the Marine Corps Recruit Depot in  San Diego: "Peacemaking Amongst Humans."  </P> <P> The three-day conference will discuss whether men are violent because of a  biological flaw or because of "socialization, masculinity and male peer  support."  </P> <P> A seminar on the Persian Gulf standoff? Not quite:  </P> <P> "The 3rd Annual Conference on Love and Violence: State of the Art in Prevention  and Treatment of Domestic Violence."  </P> <P> * Among the animals posing for pictures last weekend with Santa Claus at the  Village Faire Shopping Center in Carlsbad: a 4-foot iguana, a mini-horse, and  hamsters named Harry, Sally and Snickers. More posing this weekend.  </P> <P> * North County bumper sticker: "Sorry. I Don't Date Outside My Species."  </P> <P> * There will be ring-card girls at tonight's boxing matches at the Sports  Arena. Barely dressed, as always.  </P> <P> The vice squad pinched the girls for indecent exposure two weeks ago, but the  city attorney threw the case out as flimsier than the girls' costumes.  </P> <P> "Tradition is important," said promoter Scott Woodworth. "Besides, I think  there would be a riot if we sent guys up there with the ring cards."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Support From an Old Camper  </P> <P> Fun and games.  </P> <P> * During last summer's budget hubbub, the San Diego City Council cut $65,000  earmarked to send students in the School Safety Patrol to Camp Palomar.  </P> <P> Now, Councilman Ron Roberts wants the $65,000 restored from $300,000 left over  from the Soviet Arts Festival.  </P> <P> His move is part politics, part sentiment: Roberts was a School Safety Patrol  member.  </P> <P> * The family that drinks together, stays fit together.  </P> <P> Family Fitness Center in Kearny Mesa has applied for a beer and wine license.  </P> <P> * This is finals week at UC San Diego, so Primal Scream Therapy is sanctioned.  </P> <P> For five minutes each night (starting at 9:55 p.m.) upwards of 1,000 students  at Muir College scream their heads off to relieve stress. Then back to the  books.  </P></p>

			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / UK Company News: Mirror AGM shakes off the past Yesterday was the day that Mirror Group Newspapers finally returned to normal - two and a half years after Mr Robert Maxwell nearly brought the company to its knees. At its annual meeting yesterday the increasingly profitable company put its past behind it with a change of name to Mirror Group and there was even thanks for the efforts to help defrauded pensioners. However, it was the questions from the floor that really gave the game away. Instead of angry shareholders and pensioners demanding his resignation, Sir Robert Clark, chairman, and his board faced a series of thoroughly normal if sometimes slightly dotty questions. Just like any other company. Mr Charles Wilson, managing director, was asked whether there were facilities for guide dogs for the blind at the group's new home, the Canary Wharf tower in London's Docklands. The former editor of The Times said he did not think any blind staff were employed at Canary Wharf but blind dog facilities could be provided if they were needed. Mr Barry Gorman from Sheffield doesn't read the Daily Mirror any more because he thinks it is 'a fascist newspaper'. He's still a shareholder but didn't want to have to come all the way to London for AGMs. Mr Gorman, who views the appointment of Mr David Montgomery as Mirror chief executive and Mr John Birt as director general of the BBC as all part of the same Conservative conspiracy, accused the board of being afraid of facing the socialist shareholders of the north. However, the show was totally stolen by 70-year old Mrs Esther Allen who asked why it was that sometimes the share price went up - and at other times down. Sir Robert, who has spent many years in the City, had a stab at answering and suggested the price usually went up when there were more buyers than sellers. He confessed, however, that 'it's an art not a science'. Mrs Allen, a munitions worker at the age of 20, who is about to appear in a Daily Mirror D-Day supplement, brought the house down when she said that if the Mirror share price was going to go up she would buy some more. There was even the odd complaint about the large size of Mr Montgomery's emoluments - Pounds 325,863 - and the low price of some directors' share options - 61p. It was the most normal MGN-Mirror Group annual meeting in modern times.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Lastenia Murillo Munoz] </F>   [Text] Panamanian Foreign Minister Raul Mulino said  yesterday that Panama continues to support Costa Rican Foreign  Minister Bernd Niehaus unconditionally in his aspiration for the  position of OAS Secretary General. Mulino added that a pledged  word "is written in stone," even if it is misinterpreted later.    Mulino said that groundless reports on this subject have  been  spread because, when Panama offered to support the Costa Rican  Government, Colombian President Cesar Gaviria's candidacy was  anything but decided.    Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin de Rubio visited  Panama for a few hours to promote Gaviria's candidacy to this  position, but Panama had already pledged its word for Costa Rica.    According to Mulino, the U.S. position in promoting  Gaviria's  candidacy cannot be interpreted as "blackmail. Whether we like  it or not, the United States is a country on our continent with  the full right to vote for whichever candidate it chooses,"  Mulino said finally.</p>

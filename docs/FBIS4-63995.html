			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Mikhail Shevtsov] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 26 TASS -- Russian navy  commander-in-chief Felix Gromov believes that the major  achievement of the three-day Russian-Ukrainian talks in Moscow  was that the sides switched from general declarations to a  concrete discussion of the Black Sea Fleet share deal.    He told TASS on Thursday that "a basis had been laid for  future goal-oriented work".    According to the admiral, during the ten-day break in the  talks experts from both sides will specify the list of ships of  the fleet, will study all its bases and assess the cost of the  navy and shore facilities.    It has been agreed in principle that Ukraine will get 18 per  cent of the fleet, according to Gromov.    He said that both the Russian and Ukrainian delegations came  to the Moscow talks with their own plans of solving the dispute.  However, a common variant was drafted on the first day and  became the subject of all discussions.    The second round of talks is to be held in Kiev.</p>

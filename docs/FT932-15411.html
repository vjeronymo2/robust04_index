			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / Andreotti hearings due today BATTLE lines are being drawn in Italy's Senate for today's start of hearings on lifting the immunity of Mr Giulio Andreotti, seven times Christian Democrat prime minister, accused of alleged Mafia links, writes Haig Simonian in Milan. Mr Andreotti has said he will deliver a 100-page document to a committee of 23 senators, making clear his views on the request by Palermo magistrates to lift his parliamentary immunity. The magistrates have filed more material after new testimony from two Mafia informers living in the US. Press leaks claim this includes details of alleged meetings between Mr Andreotti and senior Mafia members. Mr Giovanni Pellegrino, senate committee chairman, said he hoped for a decision by the end of next week.</p>

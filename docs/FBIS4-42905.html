			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Chris Moncrieff, PRESS ASSOCIATION political editor] </F>   [Excerpts] The Tories were crushed almost into oblivion in  five crucial by-elections early today during a night of shame  and humiliation -- and possibly even peril -- for the Prime  Minister and his Government.    They were forced into third place in three of the contests  --  even in the so-called blue-chip stronghold of Eastleigh where  the Liberal Democrats stampeded to a stunning victory with a  9,000-plus majority.    Meanwhile, Labour sailed home comfortably in Bradford South,  Dagenham, Newham North-East and Barking -- during what Jack  Straw, their campaign chief, described as a "stunning night of  victories" for his party.    But now, threatening rumblings are inevitable from  malcontents on the Tory back-benches with the prospect of a  dangerous challenge to John Major's leadership in the autumn  looming even larger.    And what makes the outlook even bleaker for the Conservative  leadership is the likelihood of another night of disaster and  debacle on Sunday [12 June] when the European election results  are announced.    All the signs are that the news from Europe will be as grim  on Sunday, if not worse, for the Tories, as their performance  overnight.    And although a clearly shocked Sir Norman Fowler, the Tory  Party chairman, blamed the appalling results on mid-term blues,  there is no doubt that the outcome was far more serious than he  and other Conservative business managers had feared, even in  their gloomiest moments. [passage omitted]    The lowest point in a night of misery was when their  17,000-plus majority at Eastleigh was wiped out with ease by the  jubilant Liberal Democrats, with 9,000 votes to spare.    It was the spectacular completion of an astonishing  hat-trick  by the Liberal Democrats since the general election, in  capturing from the Government three supposedly impregnable Tory  seats, the others being Christchurch and Newbury.    But even in Eastleigh, where Tories have ruled for decades,  they plunged into third place behind Labour, the worst  humiliation of all.    And in Barking and Bradford South, the Tories ended third,  behind the Liberal Democrats, and with only a fraction of the  vote they secured in these seats at the general election, both  in terms of numbers and proportion.    It was probably only the eleventh-hour defection of the  Liberal Democrat candidate at Newham North East which saved the  Tories from plunging into third place there as well.    At Dagenham, the Tory vote slumped from 15,294 at the  general  election to a pitiful 2,130 today.    Despite his excuses, it is clear that Sir Norman believes  that this is far more grave a matter for the Tories than mere  mid-term unpopularity.    These results, added to the local government election  calamity last month, and the likelihood of more of the same on  Sunday from Europe, will be seen as clear evidence that the  Conservatives are lodged deep in the hole which Chancellor  Kenneth Clarke has grimly spoken about.    Now, it is almost certain that sometime next week the Prime  Minister will call an urgent council of war, involving top party  personnel, to devise a strategy to put the Conservatives in  fighting trim again.    Mr Straw could not contain his glee at the results as Labour  increased their majorities in the seats they already held, and  added the ignominy of forcing the Tories into third place in  Eastleigh.    He said: "We are delighted with the result at Eastleigh. To  have pushed the Tories into third place is a complete  vindication of our campaign. For the Tories it just gets worse  and worse."    Mr Straw spoke of Labour's "stunning night of victories,"  adding, "the Tories have done abysmally."    Sir Norman appeared to be almost in a state of shock as the  results unfolded. Dismay was written all over his face.    "These are very disappointing results," he told BBC TV.  "There is no question about that. However, these are mid-term  by-elections. We have had mid-term by-elections which have been  bad before. But we have come back and won."    He added: ``The country has been bruised by the recession.  Although a general recovery is taking place, it is not having  the individual impact that it might be expected to have.    ``That is because of some of the measures that have had  necessarily to be taken to ensure the recovery takes place --  the tax increases.    ``I believe we can win back these voters and that clearly is  what we have got to put our minds to now.''    The Tories had privately resigned themselves to losing  Eastleigh. But the scale of the trouncing was far, far worse  than they had envisaged, and even greater than the victorious  Liberal Democrats had foreseen. [passage omitted]    All this leaves the Government with an overall majority of  only 16 in the Commons -- with the Labour-held Monklands East  by-election still to come. It requires only a handful more of  Tory by-election defeats for the Government's majority to  disappear altogether.    And the stark calculation by the BBC shows that if today's  results were translated into a General Election, Labour would  have a colossal Commons majority of 339 -- fielding 495 MPs  against only 156 opposition members. And the Conservatives  would be reduced to a pathetic rump of only 69.    The Tories now face the biggest struggle in their history if  they are to catch up with and overtake in the period between now  and the next general election.</p>

			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / US, Spain lead bank profit table US AND Spanish banks are the most profitable banks in the world, according to a study by Ibca, the UK credit rating agency. However, not a single Japanese bank is in the world's 100 most profitable, even though eight of the 10 biggest banks in the world, ranked by assets, are Japanese. No French banks and only one German bank are in the top 50 and Germany's biggest, Deutsche, is number 116. Every year Ibca examines the financial results of the world's 300 biggest banks. It then calculates each bank's profits as a percentage of equity, after adjusting for the inflation rate in the bank's home country, to give a measure of 'real' profitability. Ibca expresses each bank's profitability in an index form. A score of one means the bank is earning just enough to maintain its capital after adjusting for inflation. Any score above one means the bank is adding to its capital and less than one that it is depleting capital. Nineteen of the top 50 banks are US-based. That will surprise analysts, because of problems experienced by many US banks. Indeed, Citicorp, the biggest US bank, was ranked 282 and earned a negative return. But the US also has a large number of successful 'super-regional' banks, such as Banc One, which concentrate on the profitable retail market. Two of the world's most successful commercial banks, JP Morgan and Bankers Trust, are also in the US. Universal banks, or banks combining retail and commercial operations, fare badly in the league table. The upper ranks are dominated by retail banks. Three UK banks, National Westminster, Midland and TSB Group, are among the 46 banks earning a negative return. The UK has six banks and building societies in the top 50, but five of these  -Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society, Lloyds Bank, Leeds Permanent, the Halifax and the Abbey National - are predominantly retail operations.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- THE WORLD'S MOST PROFITABLE BANKS  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Bank                             Index of real profitability  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 1 Banco Popular (Spain)                   1.398 2 Banc One (USA)                          1.300 3 Banco de Santander (Spain)              1.254 4 State Street Boston Corp (USA)          1.239 5 Bangkok Bank (Thai)                     1.232 6 United Overseas Bank (Singapore)        1.227 7 Banco Bilbao Vizcaya (Spain)            1.224 8 Bankers Trust (US)                      1.223 9 Norwest Corp (US)                       1.218 10 Bank of China (China)                  1.216  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: IBCA  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

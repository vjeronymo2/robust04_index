These issues should be left to the international organisations  that are already dealing with them, Mr Suphachai said.    Dr Suphachai was speaking at the 21st meeting of the US  Information Service's annual economic seminar entitled  "Regionalisation of Thai-US Economic Relations".    He told BUSINESS POST that it is possible to look at trade  issues on their own merits by decoupling them from side issues.    "Trade should be treated on its own merits, linked with real  macroeconomic issues, and side issues that are now coupled with  trade such as human rights, workers' rights and the environment  should be left to international organisations that are already  dealing with them," he said.    He said a country that is trying to achieve greater economic  development will try its best to improve standards of human  rights and labour relations.    "Through trade development expansion we can facilitate the  process of paying adequate attention to human rights  development," he said.    If some of the major side issues are put in the forefront,  such as the US linking of the Generalized System of Preferences  with labour rights, it may not bring results in the end, he  said. The GSP was conceived to help developing countries'  exports by granting concession terms, and is not supposed to be  linked with anything, he said. He said he understood the good  intentions of the US administration which has a sense of  humanity and is justifiably concerned with rights. But he  questioned whether its policy is the most effective way of  conditioning the whole world to move in that direction.    Dr Suphachai said the more we want to promote trade and  economic relations throughout the world the more we must work  toward depoliticising trade issues. This will benefit not only  the private sector but also the newly emerging countries, as at  least world economic growth will be more predictable than in the  past, he said. [passage omitted]</p>

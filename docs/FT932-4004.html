			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Colonials 2, Redcoats 0 IT DIDN'T make the front pages. But at least it made the front pages of the sports sections, which soccer rarely does in the US - especially not on mornings after the ice hockey finals, the first round of the basketball championship series and a full major league baseball schedule. The New York Times even thought it worthy of wry humour. Its skyline read: 'In another upset, Colonials 2, Redcoats 0.' Just in case the point was missed, the match report was headlined; 'Redcoats in Massachusetts? You already know the result.' Other newspapers were a little more prosaic about the US victory over England's soccer team in Foxboro. The Washington Post's historical comparison could only reach back as far as 1989 to the great US triumph in the World Cup qualifying competition over mighty Trinidad and Tobago. Of course, there were many references to the 1950 US victory over England in Belo Horizonte, but that achievement had always been far more infamous to the English than to the Americans. After all, in 1950 Ted Williams was still in his prime and Jackie Robinson, the first black in major league baseball, was capturing the national imagination. This time there was simple amazement at Wednesday's result. For this is a US team whose record in its previous 15 matches, several against Caribbean and Central American powerhouses, was miserable. One win (over Saudi Arabia), five losses and nine draws; it had not scored in nearly 400 minutes of play. Soccer has had a hard time re-establishing itself in the US since Pele hung up his boots for the New York Cosmos 15 years ago. But, as host of next year's World Cup, the US soccer establishment is at least trying and a victory over England can do no harm.</p>

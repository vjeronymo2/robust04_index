			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / Police confiscate Italian wine Police confiscated 4m litres of wine in northern Italy yesterday and arrested four men in an alleged doctoring scandal, Reuter reports from Milan. Paramilitary police said the wine was being analysed but had probably been laced with toxic substances in cellars near the northern towns of Vicenza and Padova. Italy, one of the world's largest wine exporters, was hit by a scandal six years ago in which 23 people were killed by adulterated wine.</p>

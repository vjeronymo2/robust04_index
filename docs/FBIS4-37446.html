			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 20 Jun (INA) -- Dr. 'Abd-al-Razzaq  al-Hashimi, head of the Foreign Relations Office in the Iraq  Command of the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party and head of the  Iraqi-French Friendship Society, today met with the delegation  of French businessmen currently visiting Iraq.    Al-Hashimi reviewed Iraqi-French relations and the need to  return them to normal in a way that will serve the peoples of  both friendly countries. He also pointed to the repercussions  of the continued unfair blockade imposed on the Iraqi people.  This blockade, he added, is a flagrant breach and a blatant  violation of all international laws, charters, and norms.    Al-Hashimi urged the French firms to make an effective move  in order to end the Iraqi people's suffering and promote  bilateral economic and trade relations.    The French delegation asserted that its visit to Iraq aims  to  discuss the Iraqi-French trade and economic relations and  promote them by all means.</p>

			<p><P> March 30, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PORT OF L.A. STEAMS PAST NEW YORK AS BUSIEST IN U.S.  </P> <P> The Port of Los Angeles has surpassed New York as the nation's busiest  commercial gateway in a shift that symbolizes the burgeoning importance of  Pacific Rim trade, the U.S. Customs commissioner said Thursday.  </P> <P> The ascension of Los Angeles, after historical domination by the Port of New  York, represents a milestone in an east-to-west realignment that has brought  Southern California to prominence as a hub of international commerce.  </P> <P> "It's literally growing by leaps and bounds," Customs Commissioner Carol  Hallett said of the new Pacific traffic. "The merchandise coming in . . . is  just staggering."  </P> <P> According to agency statistics, about 1.4 million 20-foot cargo containers  passed through the Port of Los Angeles last year. The increased volume  established the port as the leading source of government revenue from  commercial traffic, with annual collection of tariffs and fees in excess of  $1.7 billion.  </P> <P> In addition, the Port of Long Beach appears very likely to become the nation's  second-busiest port, with traffic volume last year only slightly less than that  of New York and increasing, according to newly collected data.  </P> <P> Officials in Southern California said they were not surprised to learn of the  rising stature of the Los Angeles and Long Beach ports.  </P> <P> "It's just that the Pacific Rim has a much more direct shot to us," said Chuck  Ellis, a spokesman for the Port of Los Angeles. "Why go all the way around the  world?"  </P> <P> The disclosure came at a breakfast session with The Times' Washington Bureau.  </P> <P> The agency's statistics show that in terms of commercial traffic, Los Angeles  led the nation in 1989 with 1.44 million cargo containers imported or exported.  New York ranked second, with 1.20 million containers, while Long Beach was  close behind, with 1.17 million.  </P> <P> The dollar value of goods passing through the Port of New York remains the  highest in the nation. But Customs Service officials said it was now beyond  question that Los Angeles was "taking over" from New York. The officials  predicted that the trend would continue through the 1990s.  </P> <P> "The whole Pacific Coast is definitely going to keep climbing from everything  we've seen, and it's going to be a significant shift," Sam Banks, the assistant  Customs commissioner for commercial operations, said at the breakfast session.  </P> <P> Besides proximity to Asian markets, Southern California port officials said the  recent gains reflect the region's economy and climate. The economy, they said,  provides a powerful market for imported goods; the weather ensures that  year-round shipping.  </P> <P> But the port officials indicated that traffic has not been increasing as  rapidly as in the early 1980s, when commerce and income jumped by as much as  20% a year at the Port of Long Beach. More recently, communications officer  Elmar Baxter said, annual increases have averaged about 5%.  </P> <P> Long Beach officials noted that traffic there already exceeds that in Los  Angeles in total tonnage, including crude oil and other liquid cargoes. But Los  Angeles handles more of the general cargo that is used as the principal measure  of international commerce.  </P> <P> In pledging to give new priority to improving the flow of international  commerce, Hallett made clear that she intends to chart a markedly different  course than that of her controversial predecessor, William Von Raab.  </P> <P> While insisting that the agency's anti-drug operations would not suffer,  Hallett indicated that she would seek to ease unnecessary Customs barriers that  the trade community believes have slowed traffic at ports.  </P> <P> In calling attention to the "phenomenal amount of merchandise" now flowing  through Los Angeles and Long Beach harbors, Hallett also issued a call to arms  to their eastern competitors.  </P> <P> "I've been trying to generate a little competition between the brokers and  importers, between the East Coast and the West Coast, because I think it's just  good for them all to strive to do a better job," she said. "It's big business."  </P> <P> Customs officials acknowledged that the changing patterns of seagoing trade  have caused some headaches for the agency.  </P> <P> A report commissioned by West Coast port authorities in 1987 charged that  failures by Customs to keep pace with the westward shift had resulted in  serious delays in the processing of passengers and goods.  </P> <P> Banks contended Thursday that there has since been "some balancing" of Customs  inspectors across the country. But he acknowledged that "limited resources and  limited manpower" meant that short-staffing on Western ports remains a problem.  </P> <P> Hallett also left no doubt of her determination to depart from the pattern  established by her predecessor in a number of other arenas crucial to the  Customs Service.  </P> <P> Von Raab was relentless in his criticism of foreign governments for what he  characterized as their reluctance to enlist in the war on drugs. When he  resigned last summer, he delivered an angry speech that blasted the State  Department and other agencies for giving higher priority to other concerns.  </P> <P> But Hallett, a former minority leader in the California Assembly, described  herself as a commissioner who would strive for consensus.  </P> <P> "My approach is somewhat different," she said when asked about her predecessor.  She noted that she had already met with high-level Mexican officials -- Von  Raab's most frequent target -- in an effort to "forge a partnership."  </P> <P> "You don't get anywhere if you bash them," Hallett said of the Mexican  government.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Darrell Dawsey in Los Angeles contributed to this story.  </P></p>

State Duma Defense Committee Starts Work"]    [Text] On Tuesday [1 February] a session of the State Duma  Defense Committee was held at which the main areas of the  committee's activity, its structure, and the plan of its work  for February were discussed. A final decision on the main  issues was postponed until Thursday.    In this case, the postponement is due to the sheer volume of  questions under discussion -- basically, the main issue revolves  around conceptual approaches toward legal support for Army  reforms. Three main directions have been defined in the  committee's work -- in the sphere of defense security,  regulation of the Armed Forces' activity, and social protection  for servicemen. Let us not go into detail for the time being,  let us note merely that the parliamentarians proceeded from the  formula proposed by Committee Deputy Chairman Aleksandr Piskunov  that they should first of all plan what the Duma absolutely must  do during its allotted two years. The priorities included an  analysis of the Russian Federation president's annual message  about the state of the country and preparation of conclusions  regarding the part dealing with defense, work on the defense  sections of the federal budget, amendments to the Russian  Federation laws "On Defense" and "On Military Service Obligation  and Military Service" in accordance with the new Russian  Federation Constitution and the experience of the implementation  of these laws, and also a whole range of problems to do with  social support for servicemen and military pensioners.    The plan for February includes work to clarify the laws in  the "military package," hearings into the state of preparation  and implementation of the START I Treaty, and hearings into the  prospects for the ratification of START II. New draft laws  include "On States of Emergency," "On the Sale of Released  Ministry of Defense Assets and Military Property," and "On  Martial Law." The Army's mobilization readiness, the troops'  morale, and a number of other questions also fall within the  committee's purview.    Party bloc disagreements did take place, but Committee  Chairman Sergey Yushenkov, like, incidentally, the other  committee members, did not wish to aggravate relations.  Everyone agreed that it was necessary to dispense with the  organizational prelude and get down to actual lawmaking as soon  as possible. Admittedly, a hitch nevertheless occurred when  Yevgeniy Loginov, representative of the Liberal Democratic Party  of Russia (and Yushenkov's deputy) started talking about the  need first and foremost to define a position with regard to the  military doctrine, the present provisions of which, in his view,  suit specific political imperatives but not Russia's strategic  interests. Supported by his party colleague Georgiy Lukava, he  proposed that the committee members agree with the claim of the  Geopolitics Committee to be the highest authority in the expert  analysis of draft laws affecting the state's strategic  interests. However, there was no polemic, because every  committee has the right to state its opinions about a particular  matter, and as far as the military doctrine is concerned, at  some time or another they will have to come back to it anyway in  their work on the Russian Federation president's annual message.</p>

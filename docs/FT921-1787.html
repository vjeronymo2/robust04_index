			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Albanians return to the polls After a year of multi-party democracy, Albanians returned to the polls yesterday for an election that could break the former communists' grip on power, Reuter reports from Tirana. 'This day marks the end of communism and the beginning of democracy in Albania,' said opposition leader Sali Berisha, whose inexperienced Democratic party was trounced by the former communists in last year's polls. Turnout was high in the capital, Tirana. But many voters delayed their arrival at polling stations until they had queued for bread dis-tributed by the army - a daily necessity in the chaos that followed last year's poll. No big disturbances were reported. The elections, in which more than 500 candidates were fighting for places in a new 140-seat assembly, caps a year of political and social turmoil as Europe's poorest state tries to cope with the birth-pains of democracy. Results are expected today. The Democratic party said one entire set of ballot slips had been stolen from a southern village and incomplete electoral lists were causing delays and confusion elsewhere.</p>

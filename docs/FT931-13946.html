			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / Japanese wins bitter battle to lead WHO DR Hiroshi Nakajima of Japan yesterday won his battle for re-election as director-general of the World Health Organisation, but the bitterly contested campaign, which pitted Japan against the US, has seriously scarred the UN agency. The 31-member executive board of the WHO voted 18 to 13 to nominate Dr Nakajima for another five-year term from next July. The defeated candidate, Dr Mohamed Abdelmoumene, an Algerian, was supported by the US, the EC and the Arab League. However, Dr Nakajima had the backing of most developing countries which constitute a majority on the board. This makes it virtually certain that his nomination will be confirmed by WHO's 170-plus members at the World Health Assembly in May. For months the Geneva air has been thick with accusations and denials, on both sides, of vote-buying with aid and jobs. The US, which finances a quarter of WHO's Dollars 850m (Pounds 559.2m) a year budget, complains that Japan had gone well beyond the limits of persuasive diplomacy in promoting Dr Nakajima's candidacy. Japan, the agency's second biggest contributor, says the US has been pursuing a disinformation campaign against it. Dr Nakajima, a 64-year-old pharmacologist, became WHO director-general in 1988 after nine years as regional director for the western Pacific. Within a year there were signs of a collapse in staff morale, and rumblings of discontent from western donor countries concerned about the impact on WHO programmes. These were given added impetus by the resignation of Dr Jonathan Mann, a world-renowned Aids expert, as head of the WHO's aids programme in March 1990 after a row with his boss. But no suitable alternative candidate was found to stand against Dr Nakajima until Dr Abdelmoumene, his deputy, was persuaded to run. By that time the Japanese government, which only belatedly backed Dr Nakajima first time around, had decided his re-election was a matter of national policy. However, with its two biggest contributors at loggerheads, its performance under Dr Nakajima's leadership in question, and many of its 4,700 staff unhappy and demoralised, the WHO has a difficult five years ahead.</p>

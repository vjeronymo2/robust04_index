			<p><P> September 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Several thousand people attended a peaceful pro-union rally at the Capitol in  St. Paul, Minn., to express their support for striking workers at the  $535-million expansion of Boise Cascade's paper mill in International Falls.  Later, residents of International Falls gathered in Smokey Bear Park for what  was called "a peace rally" to show community appreciation for law enforcement  personnel and firefighters. Bill Peterson, president of the Minnesota Building  Trades Council, told the St. Paul rally that last week's violence in  International Falls was prompted by the hiring of non-union labor at Boise's  mill expansion. The non-union hirings led strikers to walk off their jobs in  July. Some 400 demonstrators caused more than $1 million in damage at Boise's  temporary housing for non-union labor.  </P></p>

In his words, Belarus' Council of Ministers has no grounds  to  think that the delay in the trip is connected with  Chernomyrdin's unwillingness to sign documents on creation of a  monetary union between two countries.    "Russian and Belarusian premiers have firmly agreed to unite  monetary systems," noted Dragovets.    Referring to the opinion of the chairman of the Belarusian  Council of Minister Vyacheslav Kebich, Dragovets said that the  final date of Viktor Chernomyrdin's visit to Minsk would be  coordinated after conclusion of the British Prime Minister John  Major's visit to Moscow.</p>

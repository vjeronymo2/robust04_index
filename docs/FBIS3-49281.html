			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ewa Kaszuba and Krzysztof Olszewski: "A Unanimous </F> Choir and A Solo Singer"]    [Text] Today's NATO summit, during which all the member  states are supposed to issue their opinions on the possibility  of admitting the states of Eastern and Central Europe to the  organization, galvanized to action the diplomatic ranks of the  states that are applying for membership. Formally, membership  applications have been submitted only by Albania and Lithuania;  the efforts of the Vysegrad Group, which are equally firm, have  been confined to diplomacy. Poland's stand on this issue, which  is today unequivocal and firm, gradually evolved.    At the beginning of the democratic transformations, when the  Warsaw Pact was still in place, Poland's efforts focused mainly  on the difficult negotiations of confirming the borders with the  unifying Germany. Soon afterward, during his visit to the  Federal Republic of Germany, President Lech Walesa proposed  establishing an eastern NATO in our part of Europe. Also the  defense minister in the Olszewski government made an unequivocal  statement on Poland's need to ensure security by joining NATO.  The Suchocka government considered this to be its strategic  goal; the Waldemar Pawlak cabinet seems to continue this policy.    Last summer, when Boris Yeltsin assured Lech Walesa that  <H5>  Russia Would Not Stop Poland </H5>   from implementing this goal, it seemed that all we had to do  was wait for an invitation from the other side. The situation,  however, was aggravated by a change in Moscow's stance,  especially by recent statements of Russian politicians. Their  overtones awakened fears of a new Yalta.    Last week's interviews given by Lech Walesa to the Western  press and television prove Poland's determination. In an  interview for the Italian daily LA STAMPA, the president  cautioned against the menace of a new confrontation between the  East and the West in a cold-war style. "The East European  states must be admitted to the West European Union and NATO;  otherwise, Russia will seek to regain its influences in this  region," he said.    In an interview for THE WASHINGTON POST, he criticized the  American plan of "Partnership for Peace," saying that it is  excellent, but after 50 years of communism it does not fit the  present reality. He said that the West needs us, and not we  need the West, and he added that it is a great mistake to leave  a vacuum after overthrowing the communist system, because it may  <H5>  Awaken Demons </H5>   "We cannot speak about a partnership, because for the time  being, there is no partnership to be seen; there is Russia,  which is threatening; there is the West, which is scared;  finally, in the middle there is us, who are saying: There is  nothing to be afraid of; all that needs to be done is only  increase physically and technically Eastern Europe's resources,"  stated the president in an interview for the American television  network ITN, the German ARD, and the UPI Agency. In the latter  interview the president informed that NATO and the West "are  actually governed by Yeltsin."    The definite majority of the Polish political parties,  despite earlier subtleties concerning Poland's integration with  NATO, see this as a possibility for gaining security guarantees  for Poland. This is a result of political developments in  Russia as well as a lack of a clear response of the West.  Politicians both of the left side and of the right side of the  political scene fear the same:    "I can see two dangers: First, the reviving Russian  nationalism; second, the lack of understanding in the West for  the role of Poland in the system of European security," admits  Romuald Szeremietiew, chairman of the Movement for the Republic  [RdR].    "We should be worried by the inability to predict what will  happen behind our eastern border. It is still unclear  <H5>  What Is Actually Going On There </H5>   Also our Western partners do not have a full understanding  for our affairs, as a result of which our situation is similar  to being suspended in a vacuum, to some kind of a "gray zone,"  says Jerzy Szmajdzinski of the Democratic Left Alliance. In the  election campaign the left was rather reserved in its opinions  concerning integration with NATO. Today Szmajdzinski points to  the necessity of changing the nature of this organization and  Poland's need to seek security in a future system of European  security; he also concedes that in the past four years Polish  diplomacy has been expressing Polish state interests very well.  He believes, however, that our relations with the East were  neglected at that time, which is now bearing fruit.    Piotr Nowina-Konopka of the Democratic Union [UD] is afraid  of chaos in the area of the former Soviet Union, which may  ricochet and hit us.    "I am also alarmed by the crisis of European identity. The  West simply does not have an idea as to how to organize the  world after the Berlin wall collapsed." These words of the UD  politician are also supported by Janusz Piechocinski of the  Polish Peasant Party. He adds one more danger:  <H5>  Economic Nationalism </H5>   "For us the situation in the east will be relatively stable  -- if Yeltsin remains president. If he were forced to step  down, the advocates of an imperial policy would have a greater  say. The center of Europe would not be a quiet place also if  any authoritarian options were to be employed. Even though our  goal is still membership in NATO, it is clear that they do not  want us there in the present formula -- we are not a very  attractive partner," adds Piechocinski.    Romuald Szeremietiew thought that our dowry and a strong  argument for developing our relations with NATO and the West  would be the fact of building the Vysegrad treaty, showing that  the states that are part of it are taking care of their security  themselves. The RdR leader says that it is bad that one state  after another departs from this way of thinking; he calls this a  silly matter. He thinks highly of recent efforts of the  president and Minister Andrzej Olechowski.    "I am satisfied with the fact that everyone is unanimous in  saying that we must join NATO. I wish that political forces of  both the right and the left wing would be able to  <H5>  Define the Canon of the Interests of the State </H5>   of Poland. This should not be affected in any way by changes  of governments or any political quarrels," he adds.    Only the Christian-Democratic Union [ZChN] is not in the  unanimous choir of political parties; it claims that Poland  should be a member of various kinds of European structures, but  it must be done in line with the rules of partnership.    "We cannot be treated as a poor relative," says ZChN Deputy  Chairman Ryszard Czarnecki. He says that the prospect of  Poland's joining NATO is rather remote. "The evaluation of our  participation in the organization depends on what roles we would  be supposed to fulfill in it."    "The role of a sanitary cordon, or that of a bulwark, is not  really what we want. Now, knocking on NATO's windows, which  other parties are doing, is embarrassing and we will not take  part in that," says Czarnecki.</p>

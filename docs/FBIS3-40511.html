			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Bidding for the next-generation broadcasting  satellite BS4 by the major Japanese satellite makers has been  clarified. Mitsubishi Electric and NEC will team up with Martin  Marietta, whereas Toshiba will join Space Systems/Loral's (SSL)  team. Since the Japanese manufacturers are not competitive with  the American manufacturers in terms of cost and delivery, there  is no other choice for them but to join the American teams as  subcontractors; as yen keeps going up, so does the hurdle for  the Japanese manufacturers.    It was 1990 when the United States signed the Satellite  Procurement Agreement with Japan under the leverage of the  Comprehensive Trade Act Super 301. The agreement stipulates open  international bidding when the government or government-related  institutions such as NHK and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone  (NTT) are procuring a satellite for practical uses. BS4 is going  to be the third satellite to be procured under the agreement.    The order for the communication satellite N-STAR, procured  by  NTT in 1991, went to SSL, whereas General Electric got the  contract when NHK put the job of building its auxiliary  broadcasting satellite BS3N up for bidding in September 1992. In  both cases, none of the Japanese companies was able to bid as a  principal contractor; instead, they remained as subcontractors,  as in the present case.    It is essentially impossible for the Japanese manufacturers  to compete against the American manufacturers in the same ring,  because the Americans have the cost advantage of volume  production as a result of their defense contracts. Moreover,  with the recent reduction in defense contracts, the American  manufacturers are desperate for civilian contracts and are ready  to offer cut-throat prices, lower by $100 million per satellite  in some cases; as a result, there is no place for the Japanese  manufacturers in the business.    One could understand Japanese manufacturers wanting to give  the glory of the main contractor to American companies and being  content with the role of subcontractors, as long as they got  enough work. A top executive of a Japanese manufacturer,  however, lamented that ``even if our team wins, it would be  difficult for us to get a decent share of the work.'' The main  reason is the steep yen appreciation. If a team gives a major  chunk of the work to a Japanese partner, the total price will go  up automatically, and the team won't get the job.    Martin Marietta, which is teamed up with Mitsubishi Electric  and NEC, bought the aerospace division of General Electric this  spring.    So far, all Japanese broadcasting satellites have been built  either by GE or by someone under GE's license. The BS3N contract  was given to the GE/Mitsubishi Electric/NEC team, and the same  team is expected to be the winning candidate.    If they win the contract, Mitsubishi Electric will be  responsible for equipment such as the heat-pipe panel of the  heat exchanger and for total reliability management, whereas NEC  will be responsible for onboard equipment such as the antenna  and radiowave transmitter. All in all, however, a person in  charge confides that ``it is inevitable that the Japanese  portions will be less this time than in the case of the BS3N.''    Toshiba's responsibility on the SSL team will be, as it  stands now, reliability management and after-launch operational  support. It has not given up on the manufacture of satellite  hardware, but the chance of getting that is bleak because the  adverse yen-dollar exchange rate makes its price uncompetitive.    Toshiba is also hurting because of a delay in the H2 launch  vehicle. As a result of the delay in the development of the H2,  the launch of NASDA's Engineering Test Satellite ETS-VI, which  was built under the leadership of Toshiba, is also delayed until  next summer. Thus, Toshiba has lost a golden opportunity to  appeal its technical expertise to SSL to negotiate a higher  production share in the present project.    In addition to Martin Marietta and SSL, Hughes is expected  to  participate in the upcoming bid. The Broadcasting Satellite  Company, a procurement company that was set up by NHK and in  which NHK is the principal shareholder, is going to select the  company in charge of the manufacture by the end of the year.  Even if a team including one or more Japanese firms wins the  contract, it is still uncertain how much work the Japanese firms  can get.</p>

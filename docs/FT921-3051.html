			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Survey of Information Technology in Europe (9): After the big rush - The Japanese presence THE GREAT rush by Japanese electronics manufacturers to locate in Europe prior to the creation of a single market has subsided now that most of the leading companies are established in the region. More than 120 facilities owned by Japanese electronics companies are in Europe and these are likely to draw in further investments by medium-sized component suppliers. Contrary to popular belief, the main impetus behind the surge of Japanese investment in Europe has not been the fear of a 'fortress Europe', although that has been a concern, but the growing need felt by Japanese companies to globalise their operations. Japanese electronics companies see a strong need to be closer to their markets to ascertain the specific needs of those markets as competition intensifies in many of their product sectors. There is also a clear assumption among Japanese companies that Europe is a growth market, which will become increasingly important with the closer integration of the Efta countries and Eastern Europe. 'The whole of the European block as a market is going to be in the next five to 10 years even more important than the US, and Japanese companies want to be sure to be here for that,' says an official at one Japanese electronics manufacturer. But there is a growing recognition among Japanese manufacturers that they will have to do much more than settle down in Europe to enjoy the full benefits of the unified market. Some Japanese companies with a presence in Europe have discovered that a base within the EC does not necessarily guarantee acceptance as a European company. When Fujitsu took control of ICL, the UK-based computer group, it was embarrassed to see it excluded from the Joint European Submicron Silicon Initiative (Jessi). The Japanese companies' need to increase local content in Europe, to transfer technology and base more of their R&amp;D activities there is more widely recognised but these trends have has been slowed in part by the world-wide recession. Mr Tomotsu Harada, manager of the public affairs office at the Electronics Industries Association of Japan, thinks that once the profitability of Japanese manufacturers based in Europe is raised further efforts can be channelled into increasing local content. In this respect, companies which have had a longer presence in Europe have the advantage of being more familiar with the capabilities of local component suppliers. Panasonic Europe, for example, says that most of its 21 manufacturing plants in the EC have well over 50 to 60 per cent local content while its vacuum cleaner plant in Spain has about 90 per cent local content. The group has also cooperated with local component suppliers for some time and claims collaborative relationships with several suppliers in the UK. Panasonic, however, is an exception and many Japanese companies still complain that local suppliers do not meet their quality requirements. The situation presents an opportunity for Japanese component suppliers to follow their parent companies to Europe. Their moves are being watched with concern by the European authorities, who fear that if too many Japanese component suppliers come to Europe, indigenous suppliers could be severely hurt. Japanese manufacturers themselves are concerned that the trend could unleash further resentment within Europe. Such concerns can only be alleviated if Japanese electronics manufacturers step up efforts to support local component suppliers through technology transfers. At the eighth Japan-EC Business Roundtable on Consumer Electronics in Tokyo last October, the European position was put forward in a proposal by Mr Robert Verrue, of the European Commission's directorate on industry (DG Three). Mr Verrue proposed that Japanese consumer electronics manufacturers set up support and development programmes to improve the competitiveness of European component suppliers. Japanese companies will not respond en masse to his call, but the message, at least, will have been heard. In terms of R&amp;D, Japanese efforts in Europe have been concentrated on developing products to meet specific market conditions, rather than on basic design and research. In this respect too, early comers, particularly in the consumer electronics industry, have a head start. Mr Eric Bean, a director of Panasonic Europe, says that the group already has quite sophisticated development groups at many of its European plants. For example, Panasonic's television plant in Cardiff is producing a completely pan-European television set which will be its first TV set to be wholly designed, developed and produced in the EC. Toshiba, on the other hand, which started out as a sales operation in Europe, says that it does not yet plan to bring basic research to Europe, although it expects eventually to introduce applications research capability in Europe as well as the US. Although it plans to increase manufacturing in the EC, localisation efforts will be focused first on increasing local sales staff. Europe, however, may provide attractive possibilities for basic research in software, especially for medium to large computers, says Mr Shoji Hiroo, executive vice president of Toshiba Europa. Meanwhile, moves by Japanese companies to form relationships with academic institutions in Europe could also increase. These, too, have been slower to materialise than has been hoped but, says Panasonic's Mr Bean, 'Japanese companies still need a lot of brain power'. There are areas, such as opto-electronics and voice recognition where Japanese companies could learn a lot from academic institutions in Europe and the US. Like other electronics groups, Japanese manufacturers are looking increasingly to communications systems, such as mobile telephones and office automation equipment, office computers and business systems as attractive growth areas in the years to come.</p>

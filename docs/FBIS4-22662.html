			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Oleksandr Nezdolya and Vyacheslav Zhyhun, </F> managers of shareholding company Ukrayina, by Valentina  Pysanska: "Better to Be Rich and Expensive"]    [Text] Perhaps there is no other company in the field  about which there have been as many rumors as have circulated in  business circles about the activities of the international  shareholding trading and finance group Ukrayina, founded a year  ago. To an extent, their appearance can be explained by the fact  that the firm is trading in an area which has been one of the  mainstays of the state's income.    A HOLOS UKRAYINY correspondent wanted to get  information from the horse's mouth, as they saying goes. I  dialed the number of the First Deputy Executive Officer  Oleksandr Ivanovich Nezdolya, and heard from him:    "You are a little late, since I have been just  appointed deputy industry minister. With your permission, I  would like to introduce you to the new manager, Vyacheslav  Zhyhun, deputy executive officer and chairman of the board of  the shareholding group.    After I expressed regret at not being able to speak to  the person who had been present at the creation of the firm,  Oleksandr Ivanovich, surprisingly, graciously agreed to a  three-way conversation.    As a result, I offer to the attention of the readers an  interview which I recorded with both the former and the current  managers of shareholding group (SG) Ukrayina, Oleksandr Nezdolya  and Vyacheslav Zhyhun.    [Pysanska] Please tell us about the structure of your  shareholding group?    [Zhyhun] SG Ukrayina was formed on the foundation of state  enterprises with the participation of foreign capital.    [Nezdolya] You see, our firm was created in December 1992,  when in Ukraine a rapid decline of economic activity was  underway, including in the foreign trade area. The government  was trying to find a way to stop this decline. At the time, many  enterprises were allowed to sell their output in foreign  markets. Due to the lack of pricing information and marketing,  as well as the presence of both honest and shady partners, a lot  was sold but only a small portion of the proceeds found its way  to the state foreign exchange treasury.    Naturally, this could not go on indefinitely. In those  circumstances, the managers of five plants, with the consent of  their labor collectives and the support of the Cabinet of  Ministers, formed SG Ukrayina. Those are enterprises which  produce mineral fertilizers-- concern Styrol in Gorlovka and  production association Azot in Severodonetsk, Cherkassy and  Dneprodzerzhinsk--the Odessa port and Donetsk metallurgical  plants and conglomerates Kryvorizhstal and Zaporizhstal. As  founding enterprises, they own 65 percent of statutory capital.  On the one hand, the SG's task was to use its funds to maintain  stability at the enterprises and in industry. On the other hand,  it had to fill state orders and fulfill state contracts. Thus,  hard currency obtained for fulfilling state contracts went  entirely to the state currency fund, while funds which came from  filling state orders were used to buy raw materials and  equipment. Not just for the shareholding plants but for  enterprises of the chemical and other industries.    [Zhyhun] The founding of SG Ukrayina in that economic  situation did not take place because one person or a group of  people wanted it. Oleksandr Ivanovich has already listed the  main reasons prompting the government and management to take  this step. I want to focus attention on the fact which few  remember: one of the main tasks of SG Ukrayina was to support  the severely ailing and weakened chemical industry. It was an  industry which enjoyed steady demand in foreign markets. In no  circumstances should that industry have been allowed to decline  because of the sharp rise of energy prices. In fact, the use  of funds from the SG's export operations to purchase raw  materials, equipment and packaging for the chemical industry  helped prevent further weakening of strong enterprises and a  collapse of weak chemical plants.    [Pysanska] In effect, SG Ukrayina has become a powerful  monopoly.    [Zhyhun] It is not so. The firm sold only 60 percent of its  shareholders' output, which consists of ammonium carbonate,  ammonia, ammonium nitrate, pig iron and rolled steel. At the  same time, Kryvorizhstal and the Donetsk metallurgical plant  sold their products independently. Since the foundation of the  shareholding group, a total of $173 million worth of output has  been sold, and $76 million worth of products has been purchased  for Ukrainian industry. This includes raw materials, equipment  and chemicals to protect agricultural crops, the purchase of  which, incidentally, helped double the crop. The remaining funds  went to purchase equipment, packaging and raw materials for the  SG's founding shareholders.    [Pysanska] There was a major scandal about those purchases.  In particular, you were accused of purchasing environmentally  unsafe pesticides.    [Nezdolya] After a thorough investigation by law enforcement  organs, the case was dropped due to the lack of evidence of  criminal activity.    [Pysanska] It is said the SG Ukrayina is engaged in dumping,  i.e., it is selling at artificially low prices.    [Zhyhun] It is impossible. First, we are being constantly  monitored by the Ministry of Industry, the Ministry of Finance  and the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations. In addition, we  are working with foreign firms which have experience in world  markets. Selling at artificially low prices would have been  unprofitable for us as well as for them.    [Pysanska] At the start of the discussion you mentioned that  SG Ukrayina is an entity formed on the foundation of state  enterprises with the participation of foreign capital. So, among  its founders there is also a foreign company. Is true that it is  the notorious Syabeco?    [Nezdolya] It is true, as is the fact that the head of the  SG  Ukrayina managerial board is Syabeco owner Borys Birshtein.  Incidentally, that firm's share of the shareholders' capital is  35 percent. Accordingly, it receives dividends amounting to  slightly more than one third, minus 5 percent (after taxes and  current expenditures), which SG Ukrayina charges as a commission  for acting as an intermediary in foreign trade.    I must state that Syabeco has not done any harm to our  country. Nothing but good. With full responsibility I can attest  that Mr. Birshtein is a decent, enterprising human being endowed  with a considerable brain. If the government of our country had  specialists such as he, we may not have wound up where we are  now. When SG Ukrayina was being formed, the country had no funds  to launch it. Syabeco gave us credit.    [Pysanska] How much?    [Nezdolya] Sufficient for us to function. You know, when  good  money is being made, all sorts of rumors start around it. Of  course Borys Birshtein is not a do-gooder. He has come to  Ukraine to make money. But he is not here to steal and run away.  In 1993, he gave us $20 million at a minuscule interest rate to  buy chemicals for crop protection. He is currently looking for  an opportunity to buy natural gas from Russia. This means the  livelihood for factories and for the people who work there. Here  is an honest partner.    [Zhyhun] In addition, as for our relationship with Syabeco,  on the request of people's deputies it was investigated by the  tax inspection and the appropriate Ukraine State Security (USS)  organs, who found neither violations, nor abuses, nor any other  fraud on the part of that firm. Moreover, Mr. Birshtein is not  only a businessman but a person to whom the fate of our country  is not indifferent. He did not come here to rob us but to teach  us how to trade at a civilized level, and to establish strong  business ties which would continue to grow and create profits  for both sides. Besides, Syabeco is helping our country in a  very difficult hour. Borys Birshtein and his partners, unlike  many others, are not waiting until we start living better.  Believe me, this is the proof of the solidity of the firm, and  its good, long-term intentions.    [Pysanska] You have mentioned the USS. I have information  that its organs control SG Ukrayina. You, Oleksandr Ivanovich,  are--what?--a general of that service?    [Nezdolya] There is no secret about it. Do not beat around  the bush: I am indeed a USS general.    [Pysanska] So, the USS is now selling mineral fertilizers?    [Nezdolya] Who told you that? I have not signed a single  contract but only acted as an operational liaison with the  government, informing about the situation in the foreign markets  and foreign companies which do business with us. However, had in  1992 enterprise directors independently entered the  international market without proper experience, their lack of  skills would have harmed Ukraine and caused a shock among their  foreign partners.    Our responsibility is to protect economic sovereignty of our  country and its security in this area. There is a great need for  this, since today hundreds of firms come to Ukraine, many of  which do not really exist. They promise a gold mine, earn a  quick buck and disappear without a trace.    [Pysanska] And there is no other way aside from involving  special services?    [Nezdolya] I understand what you want to say. But our work  is  not surveillance and eavesdropping. We must protect productive  industry sectors, join the civilized world and establish market  relations. We must find the end-user, in order to reduce the  number of intermediaries. Yet, we lack experience and skills.    So, let directors learn. SG Ukrayina has a new type of  managers working for it, ones who have studied to trade in the  international market, both at home and abroad. Our job will be  to combat mafia structures and corruption. There is a difference  between honest money making and robbery.    [Pysanska] Excuse me, there is this cynical joke: you cannot  defeat mafia in Ukraine; you can only lead it.    [Nezdolya] To think like this is the beginning of an end.  But  no matter what you say, we are protecting the country's economic  independence. Ten other special export entities have now been  set up along the same lines as SG Ukrayina. I am convinced that  all this disorder and stealing of state property which still  goes on here exists only because everything is cheap: both raw  materials and labor. We, conversely, should become rich and  expensive.    Today, SG Ukrayina is still learning to trade. Nevertheless,  it has already performed a great service to the state. It is  important to understand how useful such entities will be if they  establish themselves in the world market, develop a system of  export and import operations and obtain the necessary working  capital. It should be noted that the activities of such entities  are constantly being monitored by law enforcement  organs--Ukrainian ones, too. I am convinced that the future--at  least the immediate future--belongs to such entities. There is  no other way for us.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Y. C. Tsai] </F>   [Text] Taipei, April 9 (CNA) -- Taiwan investment in  Mainland China is expected to drop as both the government and  the private sector reacted strongly to Beijing's callous  handling of the Qiandao (Thousand Island) Lake boat disaster.    Twenty-four Taiwan tourists, long with six mainland crew  members and two guides, were killed in a fire aboard a cruise  ship in Qiandao Lake in Zhejiang Province March 31. Most of the  bodies were burned beyond recognition.    Mainland authorities withheld information on the cause of  the  disaster and refused to give Taiwan reporters access to the  site. They performed autopsies on the bodies without consulting  relatives of the victims and restricted the movement of the  grieving relatives who rushed to the site after the disaster.    In response to the inept handling of the disaster, the  Ministry of Economic Affairs announced Saturday [9 April] that  the government will not consider at the moment allowing domestic  manufacturers to build industrial parks in the mainland.    The establishment of industrial complexes on the mainland,  requiring a large capital outlay, is of little help to the  upgrading of Taiwan's industrial base, said Yin Chi-ming,  director general of the ministry's Industrial Development Bureau.    Excluding land costs, Yin elaborated, development costs for  a  100-hectare industrial zone are estimated at NT$2 billion  (US$75.47 million).    It is inappropriate for Taiwan investors to make such big  investments in Mainland China, where political and economic  risks are relatively high, he pointed out.    Once the mainland's investment climate improves, the bureau  will consider approving industrial zone investment on a  case-by-case basis, he added.    Meanwhile, the Taipei-based Cross-Strait Business  Development  Foundation decided to cancel a delegation's scheduled visit to  Hainan island in mid-April.    The delegation, comprising several legislators and  representatives of a dozen listed companies here, originally  planned to investigate Hainan's investment environment.    The prestigious wealth magazine followed suit, canceling a  "securities tour of Mainland China" slated to begin in late  April, in protest against Beijing's inhumanity in handling the  Qiandao Lake disaster.    The small and medium enterprises association issued a  statement, lambasting Beijing's neglect of human rights and  urging Taiwan investors to avoid the mainland market.    Li Cheng-chia, president of the association, said that  domestic manufacturers should not invest or increase investments  in Mainland China until after Beijing authorities respond to  questions posed by the boat disaster.    Some domestic enterprises including Rosa Foods Co., Ltd.  have  shelved their mainland investment projects to condemn Beijing's  flagrant violations of human rights.</p>

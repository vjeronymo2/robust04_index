			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Salwa al-Ustuwani: "Syria: Christopher Should </F> Remedy Situation Before Proceeding to the Region"]    [Excerpt] Damascus -- Responsible sources in Damascus have  told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the Syrian leadership is waiting to  see what U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher will bring  with him on his trip to the region in the near future. The  sources said that Syria has expressed willingness to return to  the Arab-Israeli negotiating table and that there is serious  coordination with the Arab states concerned with these  negotiations. The foreign ministers of these states are  expected to hold a coordination meeting after Christopher's  visit to Damascus to set a date for the resumption of the  negotiations in Washington.    The Syrian sources added that the UN Security Council's  recent resolution on the Hebron massacre offered a reasonable  impetus for the resumption of the Washington negotiations,  provided the Arab states involved in the peace negotiations get  new U.S. assurances of Israeli commitment to the basis of peace,  for only that can spare the peace process the difficult  possibilities.    The responsible sources added that Israel is still adopting  its same known position on the peace process, rejecting the  basis, trying to prevent fulfillment of the peace requirements,  seeking to keep the peace process at point zero, and placing  obstacles in the way of any U.S. or international efforts to  reactivate the process and ensure progress.    The sources also said: In anticipation of any U.S. move to  iron out obstacles standing in the way of the peace process,  Israel always makes provocative statements or creates explosive  situations in order to contain such a move and prevent it from  achieving its objective of boosting the peace process and  driving it toward a just and comprehensive peace.    The Syrian sources added that Israel is now repeating the  same practices before Christopher comes to the region, pursuing  a calculated escalation of its policy of aggression and  repression in southern Lebanon and in the occupied Arab  territories, demonstrating more Israeli intransigence in the  face of any constructive proposals the U.S. secretary of state  might carry with him to the region with a view to extricating  the peace process from the vicious circle it was thrown into by  Israel through its intransigence.    The sources pointed out that the United States is requested  to act firmly and to throw all its weight behind the peace  process and to put the necessary pressure on Israel to compel it  to change its anti-peace policy and commit it to the principles  and basis of the peace process as specified in the Madrid  formula and in the UN resolutions, particularly the  land-for-peace principle.    The Syrian sources expressed the fear that the peace process  might be in danger of collapse if the current Israeli policy  continues, and that is why Syria believes that it is now  Washington's responsibility to rescue the process by taking a  firm stand based on committing Israel to full withdrawal and  full recognition of Palestinian rights to prevent the peace  process from moving toward the point of complete failure and the  point of no return. Washington should remedy this situation  before its foreign secretary goes to the region because the  positions of the Arab states are clear and there are no problems  for the U.S. secretary to discuss with them.

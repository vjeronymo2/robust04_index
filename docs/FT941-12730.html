			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Chiroscience to join market with Pounds 102m tag Chiroscience Group, the latest biotechnology issue to come to the market, yesterday set its flotation share price at 150p, giving a capitalisation of Pounds 102m. Although the Cambridge-based group does not expect to make a profit for several years while it develops new drugs, Mr Peter Keen, finance director, said investor interest had exceeded expectations. He claimed Chiroscience had attracted attention because, unlike most biotechnology companies, it had offset losses on its research programme with product sales to companies such as Glaxo. In the six months to August 31 sales of Pounds 1.34m helped hold interim losses at Pounds 1.37m. Funds from the flotation and income from sales of so-called synthons - the chemical building blocks purchased by large drugs companies - would be used 'to develop the full potential of chiral technology'. Research aims to develop single isomer drugs, which work faster and with fewer side effects than twin isomer products. Mr Keen said revenues from the issue, together with cash reserves of Pounds 6.9m, would be used to market existing products, enlarge the workforce and expand site facilities. The flotation of 30m ordinary shares is expected to raise Pounds 45m, of which Pounds 5m will be realised by venture capital companies from the sale of 3.33m shares. Of the Pounds 40m retained by the company, Pounds 4m will be used to finance an employee share trust, which has conditionally agreed to purchase a substantial equity stake from other venture capital shareholders. Robert Fleming is placing 16.7m shares with institutions, with the balance available to private investors. COMMENT It takes a bold company to lay claim to a market valuation of Pounds 102m less than two years after it emerged from a Pounds 1m management buy-out. Yet that is what Chiroscience has done. In March 1992 it paid Pounds 1m cash for the chiral business of Enzymatix. Analysts, who had been expecting a market capitalisation of about Pounds 80m, described the valuation as 'surprising'. They warn that even if the company's innovative research techniques begin to generate profits in five years' time, it will be a long wait for investors seeking capital growth. Nevertheless, Chiroscience is one of the few companies developing single isomer drugs which, if they fulfil their promise, could revolutionise parts of the pharmaceutical industry. But it could take several years for the drugs to realise their full potential. At 150p, the shares are not expected to open at a premium.</p>

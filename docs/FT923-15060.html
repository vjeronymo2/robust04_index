			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Leading Article: A cut too late FOR SOME months now, Wall Street has been treating bad news as good news. Anything suggesting that the economy was weak would bring forward yet another rate cut, and that must be good for stocks. On Wednesday, the news of an unexpectedly weak survey from the National Association of Purchasing Managers was greeted in just this spirit. Yesterday, came the news of employment, and an actual cut in the official discount rate, which is the Federal Reserve's wordless admission that it is worried; but this time, the markets decided, after an initial Pavlovian rise, that the news really was forbidding, and fell again. Even if it is not sustained, this was a telling break in bull market psychology. The bad news is partly economic, though the evidence here is not conclusive, and partly political. Whether or not the renewed weakness of orders and employment is a sign of a triple-dip recession, as New York pessimists now believe, it is undoubtedly bad news for President George Bush. The odds are now against an economic revival strong enough to revive the president's weakening popular support before the November election. The market, which is vulnerably high after its strong showing in recent months, now faces political as well as economic uncertainty. Both the Fed and the market were right to attach the greatest importance to the employment figures rather than to orders or survey results - let alone the still-rising official leading indicator. The Fed's latest rate cut will no doubt be denounced as too little, too late - privately by the administration and publicly by some of its supporters. But with short rates now low even by historic standards (well under half the European norm), and with the dollar drastically undervalued, it is hard to believe that an earlier cut, or a slightly bigger one, would have made very much difference. Rate cuts and devaluation have marked attempts to pull the economy up by its own boot straps, assisted by an effort to export recession. The new figures suggest that the boot straps are now too short to grasp, and that recession is being re-imported. US growth is being hampered by a debt work-out, which limits capital spending both by companies and individuals, by defence cuts and by the stagnation of real average earnings. The downturn has been intensified by the efforts of employers to cut costs, which has dampened employment even as output has been recovering. Any hope of faster recovery has rested first on net exports, which have accounted for more than half the economic growth of the last five years, and on a revival of job growth, and thus of consumer income and confidence. The latest figures disappoint both these hopes. Export order growth turned down sharply in the NAPM survey, and now payroll employment and working hours have turned down. None of this means that the US economy is in renewed recession; the British government would give its eye-teeth to be able to report a similar picture of rising output with near-zero inflation. But the staying power of this slow revival is now in question; the downturn of nearly 1 per cent in non-military order books, excluding aircraft, is especially suggestive. The American news is bad enough to be bad for all its trading partners, who had been looking to US demand to revive their own economies. President Bush may get an unusually sympathetic hearing when he calls for stimulus at Munich next week; but sympathy will not be enough, and the Fed's example remains a lonely as well as a cautious one.</p>

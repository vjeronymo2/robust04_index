			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Money supply up 2.1% Japan's key measure of money supply grew by 2.1 per cent in April from a year before, the Bank of Japan said yesterday. The figure shows a slight quickening in the rate of growth of M2 - cash in circulation, and time and demand deposits plus certificates of deposit - which is up 0.2 per cent from the previous month's revised increase. The year-on-year rate of growth was the fastest since November 1991. But the growth rate of broad money declined slightly from March and the bank warned that the rise in the narrower money rate did not suggest an overall acceleration in liquidity. The likely explanation is the transfer in April of money from money management funds, which are not included in the benchmark figure, into bank deposits, which are. Bank officials said the figures were consistent with their own forecast of a sluggish year-on-year increase in money stock of 1-2 per cent throughout 1994, a rate that indicates that monetary conditions remain tight. Meanwhile, the deflationary pressures at work in the economy were highlighted by producer price figures released yesterday. Domestic wholesale prices fell by 0.1 per cent in the first 10 days of May. Export prices fell by 2 per cent from a year earlier. The strong yen continues to depress import prices which are now 10.1 per cent lower than they were a year ago.</p>

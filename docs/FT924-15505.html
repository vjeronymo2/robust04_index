			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / Choice of unknown minister stuns Brazil: Interim president's first actions send shock waves through financial markets MR Itamar Franco took office as interim president of Brazil yesterday announcing a 90-day emergency plan to combat inflation and naming a finance minister whose appointment sent shock waves through the financial markets. The surprise choice of Mr Gustavo Krause, a little known congressman from Brazil's north-east, to run the world's ninth largest economy left businessmen and traders in the financial centre of Sao Paulo apoplectic and put paid to the euphoria caused by Tuesday's congressional vote to impeach President Fernando Collor. The main Sao Paulo index closed 7.9 per cent down on the news. 'In a crisis like this, to name someone so mediocre is irresponsible to say the least,' said Mr Roger Wright from Banco Garantia. 'Frankly speaking, it could not be worse.' Mr Krause's profile differs radically from that of his respected predecessor Mr Marclio Marques Moreira. A banker and former ambassador to the US, Mr Moreira won acclaim for bringing some stability to the economy and returning Brazil to the international financial community by securing accords with the International Monetary Fund, the Paris Club and creditor banks over its Dollars 44bn (Pounds 24.7bn) commercial debt. Mr Krause is a lawyer and politician from the Liberal Front (PFL) whose only experience is as mayor of Recife, the capital of Pernambuco, and state finance secretary. 'The charitable interpretation is that he's more of a political figure who'll employ competent technicians,' said Mr Robert Barclay, head of Baring securities in Brazil. Mr Franco had been widely expected to name a well-known businessman or politician from the south of Brazil, where the country's wealth is concentrated. However, the leaders of the wide coalition of parties supporting him could not agree on a name and after two days of bickering finally left the choice to Mr Franco. Mr Krause faces the immediate tasks of tackling inflation, which this week hit 25 per cent a month, and renegotiating an agreement with the IMF, a task made harder by his complete anonymity outside Brazil. Brazil has consistently failed to meet targets of the accord signed in January and a new accord is essential for the completion of a full agreement over its commercial debt. He will share the Economy Ministry with Mr Paulo Haddad, the new planning minister. Mr Haddad is an economist from Mr Franco's home state of Minas Gerais. Yesterday Mr Haddad unveiled a 15-point, 90-day plan to combat inflation and restart economic growth. Guaranteeing there would be no shock plan or price freeze, he called for fiscal reform and a social pact. He dashed business hopes of a reduction in interest rates from current levels of 33 per cent a month, saying this would be 'extremely dangerous while inflation is so high'. Instead he hopes to negotiate a reduction in interest rates and an increase in government investment in return for commitments to maintain jobs and stabilise prices. The negative reaction to the new economics team is an unfortunate start for Mr Franco, who assumed office yesterday, promising no corruption in his government. Earlie,r in a tense ceremony, his disgraced predecessor was presented with senate papers stripping him of his powers and half a tonne of documents implicating him in corruption. Mr Collor's signature of receipt brought a tragic end to the career of the man who took office amid so much hope 30 months ago, as Brazil's first elected president for 30 years. Booed as he left the presidential palace in the public elevator, Mr Collor now has 20 days to present his defence before the senate which will judge him on crimes of responsibility within the next 180 days. Theoretically Mr Collor could return if found innocent but the prospect is unlikely.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Japan Making Informal Contacts With </F> U.S. in Search of Clues to Resumption of Stalled Japan-U.S.  Economic Framework Talks"]    [Text] U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor has changed  his hard-ine attitude toward Japan. On 10 May, Mr. Kantor spoke  highly of measures the Japanese Government has taken for  individual sectors. In response, the Japanese Government is  paying attention to his attitude change. The issue of reforming  the current tax system is the key to resuming the stalled  Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, but it remains unclear how  the current tax system will be reformed. As the U.S. Government  is showing "a notable change" in its response to measures taken  by the Japanese Government, the Japanese Government will explore  ways to resume the stalled framework talks before the Japan-U.S.  summit talks scheduled for early July by making constant  informal contacts with the U.S. Government through various  channels.    What Japanese officials in charge of the Japan-U.S. economic  framework talks are noticing is that since late April when the  Hata government was inaugurated, the U.S. Government has begun  showing a notable change. The U.S. trade representative decided  to postpone imposing sanctions against Japan over the Japanese  Government's procurement in accordance with the Omnibus Trade  Act. During a 3 May television interview, President Clinton  stated: "The United States will not seek a numerical market  share or managed trade." During a 9 May telephone conversation  with Prime Minister Hata, the President stressed the need for  both Japan and the United States to work for resuming the  stalled framework talks.    Commenting on the U.S. moves, Japanese officials in charge  of  the framework talks said: "The U.S. Government has made such  moves out of consideration for the new government in Japan. The  U.S. Government has been concerned with the dollar's devaluation  and the drop in stocks and bonds prices. The mood may be  building within the U.S. Government for a need to alter the  hard-line trade policy toward Japan, which the U.S. trade  representative has thus far upheld." A U.S. Government official  visited Japan this week for a meeting with influential Japanese  business leaders. During the meeting, he told the Japanese  business leaders: "I hope you will visit Washington. If you  visit, then you will find how the U.S. Government has changed  its trade stance toward Japan."    Commenting on the change in the U.S. trade stance toward  Japan, a senior Ministry of International Trade and Industry  [MITI] official welcomed the change by saying: "I assume the  U.S. Government has realized at long last that no matter how  hard it pressures Japan, it cannot wring concessions from its  demands for numerical targets." MITI even goes so far as to  say: "The focal point of individual sectors has reached a point  where the two countries will have to reach a set of agreements  which will allow the United States to save face."    A Japanese official in charge of the framework talks, said:  During the informal contacts with the Japanese Government, "The  U.S. Government has consistently expressed the hope that Japan  will do something with its macroeconomic policy." The Hata  government holds a minority in the Diet and this makes it  unclear how the Hata government will formulate a macroeconomic  policy aimed at reforming the current tax system and adding the  planned amount for public works projects at the end of June.  There are no wide differences between Japan and the United  States over macroeconomic policy. American officials, who attach  importance to macroeconomic policy, are gaining influence in the  U.S. Government. This development will serve as a positive  factor in resuming the stalled framework talks.    It can be said that a climate has been created for resuming  the stalled framework talks during a time when the Japanese  Government has continued to do nothing because of political  turmoil. A senior Foreign Ministry official, however, makes a  wary response to U.S. Government moves by saying: "Basically,  the Clinton administration pursues a trade-result policy. I  wonder whether the U.S. Government has really made a `notable  change' in its trade stance toward Japan. We need to be sure  the areas of agreement have actually surfaced between Japan and  the United States. Once the framework talks have been resumed,  it will be impermissible for the two countries to break them off  again."    During the April meeting with (then) Foreign Minister Hata,  U.S. Trade Representative Kantor set three conditions for  resuming the stalled framework talks, which included: 1) a  macroeconomic policy, 2) overall targets for opening the  Japanese market, and 3) establishment of an objective criteria.  For the time being, the Japanese Government will notify the  U.S. Government of its responses to the three conditions through  the informal contacts and then seek responses from the U.S.  Government.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Highlights" of "exclusive" interview with Finance Minister </F> Rubens Ricupero by reporters Clovis Rossi, Jose Roberto Campos,  and Demian Fiocca at the FOLHA DE SAO PAULO offices on 9 April]    [Text] [FOLHA] Considering that the economic plan has no  surprises, packages, etc...    [Ricupero] Nor adjustment tables, freeze, nor bank holidays.    [FOLHA] Why not make an earlier announcement of the exact  date for putting the real into circulation?    [Ricupero] Because there is no such date. If possible, I  will make the announcement earlier than 35 days in advance. I  will try to report the date as early as possible. You know I  never lie in my remarks to the press. I can say that it is  absolutely sure that there is no such date. Sonia Mossri, a  FOLHA reporter in Brasilia, has been reporting for weeks that  the date is 1 June. I don't know how she reached that  conclusion, because there is absolutely no date; no secret  decision has been made. We have not picked any date because we  are in a complex transition stage. For example, we have to look  at the issue of utility rates. This week we will begin with  mail rates, but we will need the entire month of April and part  of May, because it is an immense universe. We are now drawing  up the decree on public contracts. We should allow private  contracts to adjust themselves. Negotiations between the  industrial and commercial sectors are in some areas much slower  than in others. In areas like that of meat, negotiations began  earlier but are going more slowly.    [FOLHA] In the negotiations between the wholesale and retail  sectors, it is possible to see that there is more disagreement  than accord. Isn't there the risk that this transition stage  will last too long? Considering that the MP [Provisional  Measure] provides for up to 360 days for adoption of the real,  negotiations could continue for an indefinite period.    [Ricupero] What I can say is even rather obvious: The real  will be adopted neither too early nor too late. It must be  adopted within a reasonable period, because we cannot wait too  long, as we would then be running the risk that you mentioned.  We want to feel the pulse of the market. Facts like the one  you mentioned will be relevant in making a decision. Yet there  are still things to be resolved, like monthly school fees, for  which no guidelines have yet been issued. We will be doing it  in the immediate future. Contrary to what has happened on other  occasions, we are trying to have economic agents find the  balance themselves. Yet people expect the government to make  all the definitions. Society has sort of a vice, as it expects  the government to define everything.    [FOLHA] Taking into account this complexity, isn't there a  risk that the need to adopt the real will make the government  issue sort of an adjustment table, as not all contracts have  been adjusted, that is, because the entire economy has not  already adopted the URV [Real Value Unit]?    [Ricupero] No. I have never heard anything about that. We  are still confident that the adjustment will be made. In FOLHA  DE SAO PAULO I read the opinions of Joao Sayad, Luiz Paulo  Rosemberg, and others, noting that it is necessary to move  faster. We must have definitions also in other areas, like  currency, the backing of the currency, the adoption of an  exchange rate index that can or cannot be fixed. We are trying  to very carefully measure the pros and cons of those options.  Yet the process, which is gradual, can become the target of  such criticism. You have the traditional experience of the  fight against inflation and hyperinflation, especially in  Central Europe, which resolved the problem overnight on the  basis of a fixed exchange rate. In the case of Austria,  inflation collapsed within 48 hours, but at an astronomical  price.    [FOLHA] Despite the fact that the government advised that  the inflation rate would drop only after adoption of the real,  many people believed that adoption of the URV would produce a  drop in inflation. However, exactly the opposite is happening.    [Ricupero] I am aware of that. I have noticed that there is  such a concern. In my opinion, this involves a communications  problem. The best way to avoid this risk, which is real, is to  make an additional effort at communication. One of the things I  have felt during these first days of work is the need to give a  better explanation of the meaning of the plan. Yet I would like  to add that my concern does not focus only on the plan, in the  short term. I am also concerned about structural matters for the  medium and for the long term. I am sure that within the short  term, the plan will yield very positive results. After adoption  of the new currency, the inflation rate should significantly  drop.    Now, we have never concealed that stability is only a first  stage for reactivating economic growth with new patterns.  Economic growth should include both the social and the  environmental cost, something that we did not do in the past.  To this end it is essential to reform the structure, that is,  the Constitution. It is necessary to resolve the problem of  lack of coordination between the branches of government. I have  said that if we had to identify the two main Brazilian problems,  the Social Security system would be one of them. In my opinion,  this subject will be the great distortion of the next few years.  We might be the only country that has placed all Social  Security regulations in the Constitution. There is also the  federal system, the three levels, the conditioning of budget  allocations, and the transfers. Everyone demands additional  spending reductions, but when we deal with the budget, it is  rigidly maintained. All revenues go to salaries, transfers, and  conditioned allocations. Only a 7 to 8 percent parcel remains  available.    It is a situation in which the country cannot move. I have  just read a paper by Professor Jose Pastore showing that the  cost of creating a job in Brazil is much higher than in any  European country. The only country that is close to the  Brazilian cost is France. As the cost of creating a job is very  high, entrepreneurs prefer not to create jobs. They resort to  overtime work, or else shift their activities toward the  informal economy or toward middlemen. Take the example of the  minimum salary. I met with the congressional committee that is  studying the provisional measure. They insist on their idea of  raising it to $100. I also believe it is fair to set the  minimum salary at $100, but to do this it is necessary to amend  the Constitution, making the minimum salary no longer  conditioned on the Social Security system, allowing for the  adoption of minimum salaries in each region.    [FOLHA] Yet hasn't the executive branch been slow as far as  making proposals for the constitutional revision is concerned?  Don't you think it is very naive to expect the constitutional  revision to succeed?    [Ricupero] I am doing my best, and I will continue to do so.  The constitutional revision does not affect me, as I will remain  in this position for only a few months. Even if the  Constitution were amended in May, I would not get any benefit  from it. The problem will be for the new president. I see no  reason for not doing the revision right now. If this is not  accomplished, it is necessary to make sure that after the  government changeover the conditions will be appropriate for  continuing the work.    [FOLHA] Are you in favor of an exclusive constituent  assembly?    [Ricupero] My best friend since I was in school, Fabio  Konder  Comparato (a jurist), favors this idea. I have already told him  that my doubts lie in how to elect the members of that assembly.  If members are elected with the same distorted rules of  representation, I do not see many differences with the current  constituent congress.    [FOLHA] The economic plan was made by a presidential  candidate. Don't you think that most of the difficulties that  you will have will stem from this fact? Don't you feel directly  responsible for the victory or the defeat of Fernando Henrique  Cardoso?    [Ricupero] I will begin by answering the second question. I  am not committed. I am a friend of Cardoso just as I am a  friend of people in all parties, even in the PT [Workers Party].  I am a public servant, I have never been anything else, and I  do not intend to be anything else, either. I am really  independent. My commitment is to stabilization. We want a  dynamic economy so that our country may recover from the  heritage of four centuries of slavery.    [FOLHA] In 1986 you worked with then President Jose Sarney,  at the time of the cruzado, which was considered a major  electoral fraud. Some people now say the same thing, that the  economic plan was made to promote the election of Fernando  Henrique Cardoso...    [Ricupero] I believe this interpretation is wrong for  several  reasons. The first is the premise that if the plan had not been  made, it would have been possible to continue with a routine  policy until the end of the year. I believe the pressure that  has already accumulated over Brazil's inflation is so heavy that  we would have had to face very serious situations that might  have even jeopardized the atmosphere for elections in our  country. We are in a complicated situation and, even with the  plan, we have a difficult journey ahead of us.    If the economic plan did not exist, I believe the problems  that would have accumulated by the end of the year would not  have allowed the maintenance of such routine policy. To speak  the truth, there was no choice. If we did not have this plan,  we would probably have brought forward the elections or adopted  just as important a measure. Second, we are doing everything  necessary to stabilize the economy. But everything does not  depend on us alone. Many decisions depend on the legislative or  judicial branches, or on the state or municipal governments, or  on other institutions, like public companies, in which case the  responsibility is ours. If the legislative branch does not  approve these essential constitutional reforms we are  suggesting, you cannot accuse me of committing an electoral  fraud. Besides, I would like to hand over the Finance Ministry  with a more solid budget situation. But in order to attain this  we depend on structural reforms we cannot control. Incredibly,  this economic plan is considered by [former Finance Minister]  Mario Henrique Simonsen as the best ever made. That is the  general opinion about it, here and abroad. This plan belongs to  everybody. In an editorial, FOLHA DE SAO PAULO stated that I  exaggerated in the speech I gave at my swearing-in ceremony. I  said that every citizen must consider the economic plan his own,  and an untransferable responsibility. But I confirm what I  said. FOLHA DE SAO PAULO is wrong, because no plan in the world  can be successful if the citizens do not engage in it  personally. To think that the plan has an automatic effect is  an illusion. If FOLHA DE SAO PAULO has a better idea it should  suggest it, because I do not know it. As for the economic plan,  it is mine now. Of course the plan cannot be separated from  those who contributed to its preparation; this is the case over  the entire world. A government is recognized by its success.  That is the case of Menem in Argentina. He will be reelected  because he did things well. Such is the logic of a political  dispute. People vote according to the merit of the public lives  of their politicians. I think the candidates themselves must  prove they have better alternatives.    [FOLHA] It is natural that President Franco should want  someone from his own administration to succeed him. In order to  attain this happy ending, he could perhaps resort to some kind  of magical solution for the economy...    [Ricupero] I am committed to defending the budget balance  and  the economic plan guidelines. That is why my dialogue with the  members of the congressional committee that is examining the MP  has been difficult. The changes they want to implement will  distort the plan. The plan must be given at least a chance to  be tested in practice.    [FOLHA] Does this mean that the MP is not at all negotiable?    [Ricupero] To accept negotiation over it implies that the  plan is not perfect. So far, nobody has demonstrated its  imperfections. For example: They spoke about salary losses.  Salaries were converted into URV's based on the average  exchange rate and, as Simonsen says, the average is at an equal  distance from the floor and ceiling peaks. To convert the  salaries based on the peak exchange rate is absurd. This is not  an imperfection but a difference of opinion. If you defend  salary conversion based on the peak rate, and I defend the  conversion based on the average rate, we will disagree until the  day of the final judgment. If you are stronger, you will defeat  me, and I will go home, and then you can govern the country by  converting salaries based on the peak rate.    [FOLHA] But that second hypothesis does not exist. If  Congress turns down the conversion of salaries based on the  average rate, you can go home, but Congress will not govern...    [Ricupero] That is the point. At some moment, I do not mean  now, we will have to make the other government branches  responsible for their actions. This situation in which you have  power and not responsibility is one of the reasons for which we  are the only country on the American continent that has not  defeated inflation. Nowadays even Russia is curbing inflation.  Why is this happening here? Is it because of some genetic  degeneration, or is it because we have an institutional problem?  I believe the media has a lot of responsibility in this; it is  incoherent. I think some of these newspaper columns of short  notes are regrettable. No newspaper in the world has three  columns of short notes, each one serving a different intriguing  interest. There are people who earn a living by inventing news  in a column.    [FOLHA] Going back to the economy, has the backing of the  real currency been defined?    [Ricupero] Partly. The reserves will back it partly, but we  must define to what extent, and if any other kind of backing  will be necessary. We are considering different options  regarding the date the new currency will be put into  circulation, the backing it will need, and the exchange policy.    [FOLHA] Some economists defend the principle that in order  to  prevent the new currency from being born contaminated, a fixed  exchange rate will be necessary for at least some time...    [Ricupero] That is one of the ideas that is being analyzed.  They all have advantages and disadvantages. It is not true that  the historical background should point in that direction (the  dollar/real parity). Chile, for example, has been very  successful with the establishment of a fixed exchange rate. In  my opinion Chile is the most evident case of successful economic  adjustment in Latin America. I will not say Chile is an example  for Brazil, because it represents only 10 percent of the  Brazilian economy. But it is nonetheless an example of success,  because it managed to stabilize without problems its balance of  payments, maintaining a good export capacity without a fixed  exchange rate. I am not establishing a position. In Latin  America you can find successful experiences both with a fixed  exchange rate, as in Argentina, and without a fixed exchange  rate, as in Mexico and Chile. None of these solutions is  transferable on its own. There is hardly any alternative. If  there were, we would have announced it already.</p>

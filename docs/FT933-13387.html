			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / Campbell curbs foreign magazines MS Kim Campbell, Canada's new prime minister, has begun to put her stamp on the nine-year-old Conservative government's policies by clamping down on foreign magazines which seek tax benefits through printing low-cost Canadian editions. The new magazine policy, announced yesterday, is a rare reversal of the liberalisation of foreign-investment rules which has marked the Tories' rule. It follows an outcry among domestic periodical publishers over a recently-launched Canadian edition of Sports Illustrated, the US-owned magazine. By commissioning a small number of Canadian stories and using a Toronto printing plant, Sports Illustrated has been able to offer advertisers the same tax-deductible benefits available to advertisers in domestic magazines. Mr Jean Charest, industry minister, said the government would revise its foreign-investment rules to require the publisher of a 'split-run' edition to obtain the approval of Investment Canada, the agency which screens new foreign businesses. Foreign investment in 'cultural' industries, such as broadcasting and publishing, has long been politically sensitive. Sports Illustrated has circumvented rules by transmitting most of the magazine electronically to Toronto.</p>

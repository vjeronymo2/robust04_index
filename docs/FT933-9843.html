			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / HK drops 15 charges against Osman THE Hong Kong government yesterday dropped the remaining 15 fraud and corruption charges against a former Malaysian banker who is serving a one-year sentence for his role in one of Hong Kong's biggest corruption scandals, AP reports from Hong Kong. Lorrain Esme Osman, 62, the former chairman of the now defunct Bumiputra Malaysia Finance, was sentenced to a year in jail by the High Court in June after he pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to defraud. He was brought back to Hong Kong from London last year after a seven-year extradition battle that made him the longest-serving unconvicted prisoner in Britain. Mr Osman was accused of approving millions of dollars in unsecured loans between 1979 and 1983 to the Carrian group of companies, a high-flying property and shipping conglomerate that collapsed in 1983, leaving debts of Dollars 1.2bn (Pounds 805m). Prosecutors said the largest loan totalled Dollars 292m. Carrian's chairman, Mr George Tan, is on bail of HKDollars 50m (Pounds 4m) awaiting trial. With good behaviour and time already spent in prison, Mr Osman could be released this month.</p>

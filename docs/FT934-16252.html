			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Dance clips Sir, For a couple of years I have been receiving the clipped columns of your dance reviewer, Clement Crisp. They are first read in Hosle, Norway, then they fly to Torrington, a small Connecticut city which is the home of the Nutmeg Ballet, a training ground for students of classical ballet. From here the columns make their way to my colleagues: to designers, an author, a sculptor, musicians and others. These dance reviews breathe with the liveliness of sharp-eyed observation and show a formidable background of knowledge and experience, a superb communicative zest and a combination of wit and truth. Bravo to Clement Crisp and to the publication that presents him. Joan Kunsch, associate director, Nutmeg Ballet, 21 Walter Street, Torrington, Ct 06790, US</p>

			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / US investors find strength in diversity: A sluggish New York market has made larger UK stocks an attractive option Yesterday's official figures on share ownership provide the first glimpse of how dramatic the shift of US money abroad has been for the UK market, which has traditionally looked eastward first for new capital, rather than across the Atlantic. It should come as no surprise that US investors are buying foreign stocks. UK fund managers have been opening offices from Atlanta, Georgia to Chicago, Illinois for the better part of the 1990s, hoping to capitalise on the growing trend for portfolio diversification. Mr Jim Waterman, senior vice president at InterSec, a US-based pension fund research company, said yesterday: 'Most plan sponsors now accept the diversification rationale - that an internationally diversified portfolio lowers overall risk.' The fact that US markets have moved sideways and downwards over the past year has emphasised the merits of diversification, as have a weak dollar and a slump in US government bond markets. Also, retail investors in the US have suddenly woken up to the merits of asset diversification. Data from the Investment Company Institute, the trade association for mutual fund companies, shows that at the end of October 1994, holdings of US mutual funds investing in foreign equities soared to Dollars 106.76bn (Pounds 65m), up from Dollars 71.0bn at the end of 1993 and Dollars 14.3bn at the end of 1990. Ms Malin Jennings, director of communications at the institute, said: 'As the stock and bond markets in this country have tapered off, people are looking for growth elsewhere.' The CSO statistics show foreign investors as the single biggest category of UK share buyer in the past year - owning 16.3 per cent of all equity on the UK stock market by the end of 1993, up from 13.1 per cent at the end of 1992 and 3.6 per cent at the end of 1981. The statistics confirm the anecdotal evidence that it is US investors which form the largest single foreign presence, accounting for 54.2 per cent of all foreign money in the UK stock market, with an aggregate value of Pounds 49.2bn. Investors based in the European Union hold a paltry-by-comparison 19.5 per cent of all foreign-owned shares in Britain. Investment by pension funds, by contrast, slipped slightly at the end of 1993 to 34.2 per cent of the market from 35.1 per cent the year before. Measured by value, foreign investors are an even more significant force in the market. Their holdings jumped 49.6 per cent to Pounds 130.2bn at the end of 1993 from Pounds 80.7bn the year before. The figures suggest that US investors are buying the highest-value shares. Mr Waterman suggests that this is explained by the nature of the mandate US pension schemes give their foreign stock managers. The vast majority of such mandates are for EAFE - Europe, Australia and Far East, an index compiled by Morgan Stanley Capital Index. Managers tracking this index will have weightings of shares in each country equal to that country's weighting in the index. Within each country, the manager will buy shares which account for a disproportionate part of the domestic stock index. Tracking this index will naturally tilt US funds towards the larger capitalised stocks. Some fund managers note a growing trend towards 'specialised' mandates, a move which could encourage US investors into UK mid and small capitalisation stocks. Mr Michael Bullock, managing director at Morgan Grenfell Investment Managers, which manages money for US clients, said it had taken on an increasing number of such accounts in the past year. Dunedin Fund Managers, in Edinburgh, has attracted about Dollars 2bn of US pension fund money by capitalising on its skill as a world-wide investor in smaller company stocks. Meanwhile, the growing presence of US investors in Britain is beginning to have an effect on the way shares are bought and sold and on the relationship between companies and shareholders. Mr Bullock said: 'Big American (investors) are used to the very competitive commission rates they get in their own country. They don't understand why these shouldn't be as competitive elsewhere.'</p>

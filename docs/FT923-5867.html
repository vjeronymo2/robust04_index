			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / Efim bankers hold three trump cards: The Italian treasury has the weaker hand in negotiations on state holding company's debts Negotiators in the row over Efim, the Italian state holding company put into voluntary liquidation last month, are engaged in a round of brinkmanship ahead of their planned meeting in London early next month. While the Italian treasury seems ready to compromise, possibly to exploit divisions among foreign creditors, Efim's London-based lenders are threatening to disrupt Italy's ambitious privatisation programme before it gets off the ground. Efim has defaulted on its loans by virtue of the fact that it has gone into liquidation: its subsidiaries are unable to make payments on their loans as they fall due and so are also in default. The treasury plans to issue bonds to creditors to repay the loans. The creditor banks maintain that Efim, and its subsidiaries Agusta and Safim, borrowed in the international loans market on competitive terms. 'As far as the banks were concerned, this was state risk: Agusta was able to borrow on much more favourable terms because of the Efim name,' said one banker. The treasury says banks should have known about Efim's perilous finances, and that high interest rates on Efim's debt reflected this risk. Efim's bankers have three trump cards when they meet Mr Mario Draghi, the senior civil servant in charge of negotiations. Principle. Efim was viewed in the Euromarkets as a state risk, even if there was no explicit treasury guarantee. Unilateral default by one of the world's seven richest countries is unacceptable to bankers. Intimidation. Failure to meet creditors' demands could threaten treasury minister Piero Barucci's privatisation programme. Four public sector entities - IRI, ENEL, ENI and INA - were recently transformed into joint stock companies in the first step towards restructuring and disposals. Foreign bankers argue the change in status means the first three are now technically in default on their loans. Ordinarily this would be overcome by a waiver from the banks. 'Until such time as there is a satisfactory response on Efim, these banks are going to withhold their waivers', said one banker. 'Bankers are looking very closely at this question . . . it's a pressure point and both parties know that - the whole privatisation programme could be jeopardised.' The treasury is acutely aware of the risks. Future borrowing. Until this is resolved, Italian borrowers will find it almost impossible to tap the syndicated loans market and state-owned companies may have to issue bonds. The problem could become acute as several loans to IRI, ENI and ENEL are due to mature within 18 months. With the Efim issue unsettled, the chances of rolling over debt seem slim. A continuing row over Efim could also close the door to other Italian borrowers. Last year's dispute between international banks and the Italian authorities over the collapsed Federconsorzi farm services group showed how easily the loan market could be shut off to Italian names. Some banks - mainly Japanese ones with a large exposure to Federconsorzi - refused to lend to Italian state borrowers in protest at the government's failure to repay the group's debts. When Italian names were able to return to the loans market, they had to pay higher pricing on their credits. The treasury has opened the door for talks with Efim's foreign banks and has hinted it may be prepared to raise the interest rates on bonds it plans to issue to creditors to repay the loans. The five-year lira bonds being offered by the treasury will pay 7.25 per cent interest, while the Ecu-denominated paper has a 4 per cent coupon - around half current market levels for both currencies. As a result, creditor banks will receive almost 80 per cent of the principal and interest due. Creditor banks appear to be divided between those with sizeable operations in Italy (who appear less aggressive about full repayment) and others working out of London (who are pushing for 100 per cent of their money back). 'Some of us understand that the domestic political environment could still come up with solutions which London banks can't envisage', says one banker in Italy. Treasury officials have argued that the gap will close if market rates come down during the five-year life of the bonds, which pay interest at a fixed rate. So a 2 or 3 percentage point rise in the interest rate on the bonds may be enough to convince some creditors to compromise. Creditor banks can claim tax relief against the lost income, raising receipts in some cases to 95 per cent of what was due. The issue of tax is complex, and will not affect creditors equally. However, it is likely to be discussed at the forthcoming talks. Most leading commercial Japanese banks have lent money to Efim. A Tokyo business newspaper estimated syndicated loans extended by 17 Japanese banks at around Dollars 540m (Pounds 270m). Some banks sounded hopeful. 'There is no way that all of the loans will not be repaid,' said Fuji Bank, which has some Y1bn (Pounds 4.03m) in loans to Efim. However, most said Mitsubishi Bank, the agent bank, was handling negotiations. Foreign banks are in a quandary: while they want full repayment, some are hoping to benefit from the profitable valuation and corporate finance mandates likely to stem from privatisation. Italian press reports have suggested Euromarket loans may have a more generous treatment than domestic loans. That may not appeal to the treasury, which has highlighted the fact that domestic and foreign banks are being treated equally. Nor may it be willing to concede more than a token rise in rates on the bonds. Yet, failing a joker in the pack, it seems to hold the weaker hand. Efim loan details, Page 21</p>

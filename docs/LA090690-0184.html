			<p><P> September 6, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA NIGUEL;  </P> <P> RIDGELINE PROTECTION DECISION IS DELAYED  </P> <P> After an emotional public hearing marked by property owners' threats of  lawsuits, the City Council voted to postpone for 30 days a decision on a  proposed ridgeline protection ordinance.  </P> <P> The proposal, which is intended to protect undeveloped ridgelines throughout  the city, has provoked the wrath of hilltop property owners, who have been told  by city officials that they may not be able to build upon their lots. The  neighborhoods of Bear Brand Ranch and Monarch Point could be especially  affected.  </P> <P> As it is now written, the proposed ordinance would ban development within 300  feet of ridgelines that are in "view of scenic highways," such as Pacific Coast  Highway or Crown Valley Parkway. It also would place some restrictions on  development within 500 feet of such ridgelines.  </P> <P> In Bear Brand Ranch alone, 40 to 50 lots worth up to $40 million could be  affected if the ordinance is passed, developer Robert O'Hill told the council  Tuesday night. City officials have warned that Laguna Niguel could be sued if  the properties are rendered undevelopable by the proposed ordinance.  </P> <P> Some residents said the move to preserve the ridgelines, at first well  received, now has generated bad blood in the community.  </P> <P> "You have the most insidious type of initiative here," said Monarch Point  resident Cassie De Young. "There is no question that it's unconstitutional."  </P> <P> The city staff had recommended that the council allow officials 30 days to  explore what City Manager Tim Casey called the "extraordinarily complex" fiscal  and legal impact of the proposed ordinance. The council's options are limited  because the proposed law was drafted as an initiative, signed by residents, and  now must be either approved as is by the council or voted on by the community.  </P> <P> Council members said they have been inundated by calls from worried  constituents.  </P> <P> "I've kept a very copious count and I think we've counted 49 threats since I  started answering my phone on Thursday," Councilman Paul Christiansen said.  Councilman Thomas W. Wilson added: "This issue has definitely escalated to a  level above and beyond our young city's expectations."  </P> <P> Mayor Patricia Bates, who owns a lot in Monarch Point, and Councilman James  Krembas abstained from the 3-0 vote to postpone a decision.  </P> <P> During almost two hours of public testimony, 21 people spoke against the  ordinance and only one in its defense. Some who criticized the proposal were  petition signers who now say they did not understand the implications of the  initiative.  </P> <P> Calling the proposed ordinance a potential "catastrophe," Bear Brand Ranch lot  owner Fred Burbank said it would "wipe out the rights of the people who own  these lots."  </P> <P> "To even give this the legitimacy of study is absurd," Burbank said. "It should  be flushed early."  </P> <P> Richard Taylor, chairman of committee backing the ordinance, said the group  expected "heavy-duty opposition" against the initiative, but not from  individual lot owners. While conceding that he does not understand all the  legal aspects of the ordinance, Taylor said it was not intended to halt  construction by individual parcel owners.  </P> <P> "My heart bleeds for these folks," he said after the meeting. "If I had been in  Bear Brand Ranch and . . . it was going to affect me, I'd be the loudest voice  there."  </P> <P> A separate ridgeline-protection and hillside-development ordinance has been  prepared by a city consultant and is being considered now by city planners.  That proposal has different setback requirements and would allow officials to  consider each development proposal individually.  </P> <P> However, Taylor, who considers such allowances to be "loopholes," predicts that  the intention of the initiative eventually will be clarified and residents will  again rally behind it.  </P> <P> "I think the people will realize what the intent is," he said. "We don't want  to condemn anything. We want to protect the ridgelines." LESLIE EARNEST  </P></p>

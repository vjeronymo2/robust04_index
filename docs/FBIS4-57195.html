			<p>Embassy   <F P=102>   PY1305161194 Buenos Aires NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS in Spanish  1436 GMT 13 May 94 </F>  <F P=103> PY1305161194 </F> <F P=104>  Buenos Aires NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS </F> <F P=105>  Spanish </F> BFN     [Excerpts] Buenos Aires, 13 May (NA) -- A tear gas grenade  exploded this morning in the Rio de La Plata Building, where the  Japanese Embassy has its offices, in repudiation of the Japanese  refusal to grant a visa to soccer star Diego Maradona. Three  people were injured. The explosion occurred just after 0830  [1130 GMT] when embassy employees opened the door to the offices  on the 9th floor.    According to Alberto Crescenti, director general of the SAME  [expansion unknown], the explosion at Paseo Colon 279 caused eye  problems and suffocation to the following: Roberto Blanco;  Carlos Catalano, 23; and Andrea Vousou, 22. The three were  quickly taken by ambulance to the Algerich Hospital in La Boca  District where it was determined that their injuries were not  serious.    Pamphlets with the slogan "Down with Japan, lay off  Maradona," of the Revolutionary Organization (ORP) were found in  the building. This shows that the attack was in reprisal to the  Japanese Government decision to not grant Maradona a visa.  [passage omitted]    One employee told NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS: "It is all very  strange because the building has a contracted security  organization in addition to the embassy security guard.  Therefore, it is very difficult to understand how the grenade  could have been planted in the building." [passage omitted]</p>

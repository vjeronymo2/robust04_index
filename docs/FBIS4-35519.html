			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 31 May (INA) -- Iraq has protested the  facilities that are still being provided by Saudi and Kuwaiti  rulers to American, British, and French aircraft. A letter sent  by Iraq's permanent Arab League delegate to the League's  secretariat noted that the facilities extended to the aircraft  violating Iraqi airspace pose a threat to the security,  sovereignty, and national unity of the country.    From 17 to 23 May, these aircraft mounted 372 sorties,  having  taken off from bases in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.    Iraq's League delegate asked that copies of the letter,  which  detailed the violations, be circulated among the member states.</p>

			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Sport: The Chinese puzzle In September the sporting world orbited around Beijing. In part this was predictable. The long campaign to host the 2000 Olympics was a battle between the pro and anti-Beijing factions. At the vote in Monte Carlo on September 23, Beijing lost to the white-bread candidate, Sydney, 45-43. The explosion of records set by Chinese women runners in Beijing over the preceding fortnight may have been calculated to win votes by confirming China's emergence as an athletic power. Instead they brought accusations of cheating. As Linford Christie said: 'The world of athletics has gone mad. Everyone thinks everyone is taking drugs.' On September 8, Wang Junxia cut 42 seconds off the women's 10,000m record. On September 11, Qu Yunxia won the 1,500m in record time. Wang, second, also beat the old record. On September 12, in the 3,000m heats, Zhang Linli broke the world record, then Wang broke the new record by nearly 10 seconds. The next day she broke that record by six more seconds. The wins were greeted with disbelief. 'Here is a 20-year-old coming out of the blue. It goes against everything in athletics. You train to progress and get better. There is no progression with the Chinese. It doesn't make sense,' said Lynn Jennings, three times the world cross country champion. The Chinese runners are members of a team coached by Ma Junren. Ma's army often runs a marathon a day. Ma's regime emphasises posture and diet, which includes caterpillar fungus tonics and soft-shelled turtle blood. Distance running has been largely free of drugs because bulk steroids hinder sprinters. Runners need to increase their blood's ability to carry oxygen. One way to do this is to train at altitude. Ma's athletes do a lot of this. But many have sought other explanations. Some suggest blood doping. Blood is drawn from the athletes and stored. Before a race the blood is re-infused, increasing the concentration of blood and its capacity to carry oxygen. Others worry that the Chinese are using a synthetic hormone developed for kidney dialysis patients which stimulates the creation of red blood cells. It may be that the Chinese have learnt from the old Eastern bloc: the art of selecting athletes at a young age. Since China has one fifth of the world's population such an approach would inevitably yield results. The logical first target would be the softest set of athletics records, in the events with the shortest history and low numbers of world class participants: women's distance running.</p>

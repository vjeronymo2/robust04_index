			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / US set to upgrade role in Bosnia THE US is expected to provide crucial intelligence and other support to the new United Nations forces due to be deployed to protect aid convoys in Bosnia. It is expected that US officers will join a headquarters operation drawn largely from the existing structure of Nato's German-based Northern Army Group. The main US contribution on the ground would be a field hospital, but it is thought Washington may also provide heavy transport aircraft to help with the deployment. The move is significant both for the US, in committing even limited numbers of military personnel to former Yugoslavia, and for the UN, in extending the scope of peacekeeping operations to include intelligence-gathering. US participation is understood to have been sealed despite initial French reservations. The force will be commanded by France's General Philippe Morillon, with Britain providing the largest number of troops. The UK is expected initially to send more than the 1,800 troops. Its concerns about command and control arrangements in Bosnia have been met by plans to transfer a 'core' headquarters operation from the Northern Army Group. Germany, which is part of this Nato grouping alongside the UK, Holland and Belgium, will not take part because of its constitutional constraints. The gap will be filled by France and others.</p>

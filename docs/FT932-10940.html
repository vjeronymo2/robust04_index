			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / UK Company News: RPC flotation to raise Pounds 30m and give Pounds 75m value RPC GROUP, the rigid plastic packaging company, has issued the pathfinder prospectus for its flotation later this month. The float is expected to value the group at about Pounds 75m and raise over Pounds 30m. Of the shares sold, 65 per cent will be placed with institutions and 35 per cent will be available through a financial intermediaries offer. The price of the shares will be announced on May 18. The prospectus showed that operating profits for the year to March 31 rose from Pounds 4.96m to Pounds 6.95m, on sales ahead 10.2 per cent at Pounds 63.7m. It said that the new financial year had started well with 'encouraging' order levels and production activity across all its product ranges. Since the group completed a Pounds 33.4m management buy out two years ago profits have risen 2 1/2 times. CINVen, which backed the MBO, is to retain about 25 per cent of RPC's shares after the float. Management and employees will have about 20 per cent. Unusually, RPC will increase its debt through the flotation. It will use more than the money raised to redeem preference shares and buy back shares from existing investors including staff. As a result the group will add about Pounds 4.3m of debt, with gearing rising from virtually nil, prior to the float, to nearly 20 per cent afterwards. RPC's directors said they were confident that the company's strong cash generation, which has allowed it to repay Pounds 12m of debt and invest another Pounds 12m since its MBO, meant taking on debt would not be a problem. RPC has about 10 per cent of the rigid plastic packaging market in the UK, making it the second largest participant. No one customer accounts for more than 5 per cent of sales, and 44 per cent of its turnover is in food containers. Packaging for surface coatings, mainly paints, represents the largest single part of turnover at 21 per cent. Mr Ron Marsh, chief executive, said RPC had an excellent opportunity to become the dominant manufacturer of rigid plastic packaging in the UK market. This type of packaging has been growing faster than others, for example, as it was substituted for other materials such as metal and glass. Paints used to be packed in cans, but now more than half the market for emulsion paints was in plastic pots. About 35 per cent of tomato ketchup was now sold in squeezy bottles instead of glass. RPC is keen to expand into packaging for toiletries and is also looking at making European acquisitions. The prospectus said that prices of polymers, the main raw material accounting for 29 per cent of group costs, were beginning to rise after falling significantly since 1991. Mr Marsh said that 30 per cent of group turnover was on contracts where prices were linked to polymer prices. He said there had not been a significant benefit from falling prices over recent years. Baring Brothers is the merchant bank and Cazenove the broker to the issue.</p>

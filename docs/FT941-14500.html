			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / Later openings likely for shops Shops will, in theory, be allowed to stay open around the clock if the de-regulation bill becomes law. There was no sign yesterday, however, that retailers were preparing to introduce 24-hour shopping. Most shops are supposed to close at 8pm on weekdays, apart from one night when they are allowed to stay open until 9pm. Clause 17 of the bill would allow shopkeepers to stay open as long as they liked. The bill would do away with local anomalies on early-closing days. Shops would be free to decide whether they closed, rather than being subjected to local-authority requirements. The provisions are separate from a bill on partial de-regulation of Sunday trading likely to be passed later this year. Asda, the retail chain, welcomed the weekday de-regulation move and said: 'We think that as retailers we should be free to open whenever our customers want to shop.' It did not anticipate making significant changes to trading hours, but some stores, particularly in metropolitan areas, might stay open more often until 9pm. Asda added that there was no evidence of demand for 24-hour trading in the UK. Marks and Spencer said it opposed Sunday trading, but favoured de-regulation of weekday opening. It envisaged some later opening for edge-of-town stores for after-work shopping. Sainsbury said it had no plans to open any of its stores around the clock. John Lewis said the final shape of the Sunday trading bill would affect its decision on weekday hours. Mr Pat Jones, national spokesman for Usdaw, the shopworkers' union, feared pressure would be put on retailing employees to work round the clock. He said: 'It would be getting back to the pre-war position, when it was common for shopkeepers to go outside and see if their competitors had closed before they decided to close themselves.'</p>

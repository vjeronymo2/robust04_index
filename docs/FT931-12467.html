			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / Leading Article: Needlessly bust WITH THE number of business failures showing no sign of abating, the suspicion is growing that Britain's recently revised insolvency laws are still dangerously deficient. Potentially sound businesses are, it is claimed, being needlessly broken up. Insolvency fees appear sky-high. And the new procedure of administration, intended by the 1986 Insolvency Act to give potential survivors a breathing space, has, on one estimate, been used in less than one per cent of insolvency cases. The clearest evidence of a bias against resuscitation lies in the preferential treatment accorded to the Inland Revenue and the Customs and Excise. Whereas unsecured creditors have a continuing interest in keeping a company afloat, government departments know that as preferential creditors they can usually extract their money quickly in an insolvency. Voluntary arrangements with creditors designed to permit companies to trade their way out of trouble are thus frequently blocked. Insolvency can also appear unduly tempting for the banks where they have the benefit of security. Certainly the infrequent resort to administration reflects their predilection for receivership. Not that bankers are exclusively to blame. Administration orders are expensive, difficult to obtain and risky for directors whose conduct may be investigated by the administrator. It does not help that insolvency practitioners themselves can be involved in potential conflicts of interest. There have been too many cases of investigating accountants subsequently conducting lucrative receiverships after pronouncing borderline companies beyond hope. Creditors' committees have not found it easy to prevent insolvency practitioners stringing out receiverships, thereby swelling fees. A more flexible and less expensive sanction than seeking redress from the court is called for. In trying to promote the practice of intensive care, there is clearly a balance to be struck. The problem with a lenient approach like the US Chapter 11 bankruptcy procedure, which leaves directors in charge, is that companies can rack up inordinate losses at the creditors' expense for too long. This can threaten the viability of a whole industry, as in the case of the US airlines. Yet as Coopers &amp; Lybrand has recently argued, there are plenty of ways in which Britain could avoid that risk. It suggests, inter alia, encouraging company voluntary arrangements by introducing a stay on creditors' remedies while rescues are put together; and making administration orders easier to obtain and more attractive to directors. With unemployment soaring and business failures running at an estimated 80,000 or so a year, insolvency reform is no longer wholly devoid of political sex appeal. The president of the Board of Trade, Mr Michael Heseltine, should give it higher priority on his agenda.</p>

			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WIFE OF CONVICTED KILLER SAYS SUIT SETTLEMENT VINDICATES HER  </P> <P> Gail Harrington-Wisely, the wife of convicted murderer Willie Ray Wisely, says  she feels "completely vindicated" by the $70,000 paid to her by the county last  week to settle her lawsuit stemming from her 1987 arrest on charges of  smuggling drugs into the jail.  </P> <P> Harrington-Wisely said she was informed by her Santa Ana law firm that a check  had been received from the county, following informal negotiations. She said  she expects to receive about $45,000 after legal fees are deducted.  </P> <P> "A significant portion of that money will be used to get Willie Wisely out of  prison," said Harrington-Wisely, who was a law student at the time of the  arrest. "He's an innocent who's been in prison for almost 11 years."  </P> <P> Harrington-Wisely, 28, was arrested in August, 1987, on suspicion of smuggling  drugs to an inmate during a legal consultation in the Orange County jail. A pen  containing about three grams of marijuana and cocaine was taken from the inmate  after he left a meeting with Harrington-Wisely, who was working as a law clerk.  </P> <P> The charges against Harrington-Wisely were dropped in 1988 after a sheriff's  deputy testified at a preliminary hearing that the inmate could have been given  the drugs in a holding cell before Harrington-Wisely's visit.  </P> <P> In December, 1987, Wisely was sentenced to life without parole for killing his  stepfather, Robert Bray. Bray was crushed to death in 1981 while he was working  under the cab of his tractor-trailer rig on a street in Huntington Beach, where  he lived. Later in 1981 Wisely was convicted of the killing and sentenced to  death, a penalty that was subsequently thrown out because of state Supreme  Court rulings on jury instructions.  </P> <P> While being held in the Orange County jail, Wisely filed numerous lawsuits over  conditions in the jail, including one in which he was awarded $5,050. Through  court motions he obtained his own eight-man double cell, equipped with a  computer and a private telephone that enabled him to work on his own case.  </P> <P> Earlier this year, the 4th District Court of Appeal upheld Wisely's conviction.  He is now serving his sentence at Corcoran State Prison in Northern California.  </P> <P> Harrington-Wisely said she expected her husband's attorneys to file a petition  this week to the appeal court, asking for a rehearing. If that is denied, she  said, Wisely will appeal to the California Supreme Court.  </P> <P> Harrington-Wisely, who has moved to Lemoore, near the prison, said she visits  her husband five days a week and continues to devote her time to freeing  Wisely. "I work on that case every day," she said.  </P> <P> Harrington-Wisely secretly married Wisely on Christmas Eve in 1987 after  bringing a minister with her into the same meeting room where sheriff's  deputies said the drug smuggling took place. She met Wisely when she was a law  student and was interviewed by him for a law clerk position the courts had  granted him.  </P></p>

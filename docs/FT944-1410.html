			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / International Company News: Serafino Ferruzzi on brink of liquidation Creditors of Serafino Ferruzzi, the private holding company which once controlled the Ferruzzi family's business empire, yesterday gave notice that they intended to put the company into liquidation. The move would finally cut the Ferruzzi family's financial ties with the Ferruzzi-Montedison industrial group, which came within hours of filing for bankruptcy last year, brought to its knees by alleged corruption and mismanagement. Creditor banks yesterday told the Ravenna bankruptcy court which has been hearing the case that they were intending to liquidate Serafino Ferruzzi. The move was backed by Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin), the quoted holding company in which Serafino still has a 12 per cent stake. Italian news agencies said the Ferruzzi family's representatives supported liquidation, which requires formal approval by the regulatory authorities. Shareholders would nominate a liquidator at a special assembly, probably before the end of the year. The trigger came at the weekend when Ferfin's directors reluctantly agreed to renounce L326bn (Dollars 199m) owed to Ferfin by Serafino, and write off a L100bn issue of Serafino bonds held by a related company. In exchange, the family company will write off a L169.9bn Ferfin debt. Mr Guido Rossi, Ferfin chairman, held out against such a solution until the weekend when it became clear that otherwise Ferfin might have to repay the debt to Serafino, without recovering what it was itself owed. Ferfin said the net write-off would affect the group's 1994 accounts. Ferfin was expected to record a net loss for the year. The company said that loss would still be lower than in 1993, in spite of the unexpected increase in extraordinary charges. The 12 per cent stake in Ferfin is likely to be taken up by the banks, which are the holding company's largest shareholders.</p>

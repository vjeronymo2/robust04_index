			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow shows resilience to poor consumer data Wall Street AFTER profit-taking and news of weakening consumer confidence had depressed US stocks in early trading, share prices recovered their losses to end the day mostly flat, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed just 1.12 down at 3,672.49, well off its low for the day of 3,654.05. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended 0.10 up at 464.30, while the American SE composite was 1.94 off at 473.64 and the Nasdaq composite lost 4.29 at 765.46. NYSE volume was 285m shares. Although prices firmed at the opening, it was clear that market participants were ready to take some quick profits after Monday's gains when the Dow rose to an all-time high. Consequently an early 10-point climb for the Dow turned into a 10-point loss within the first hour of trading. Profit-taking was not confined to the big blue chip industrial and cyclical shares which lifted the Dow into record territory on Monday; secondary stocks posted their second straight day of declines. Concern about the economy deepened yesterday after the Conference Board announced that its index of consumer confidence had dropped in October to 59.4, down from a revised 63.8 for the previous month. The news lifted bond prices for the first time in three days, but initially depressed equity market sentiment, until a round of buying mid-afternoon helped most stocks recover their early losses. Only secondary issues traded on the Nasdaq market remained firmly rooted in negative territory. IBM rose Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 46 1/8 after the troubled computer giant unveiled a third-quarter loss of 12 cents a share, smaller than analysts had expected. Investors were not sure what to make of the data, with the stock rising initially, then falling, only to recover strongly in late trading. Leading Dow stocks which were in good form on Monday wilted on profit-taking. Eastman Kodak receded Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 57 7/8 and Aluminum Co of America Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 69 5/8 . RJR Nabisco lost Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 5 1/4 but rallied to end unchanged at Dollars 5 3/8 , after the tobacco and foods company unveiled third-quarter net income sharply lower than a year ago because of the cigarette price war. Pharma Resources rose Dollars 3 to Dollars 16 7/8 in heavy trade after the US Food and Drug Administration said it would review the company's applications for generic drugs, a decision that opens the way for the company to seek new product approvals. National Health Laboratories dropped Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 13 1/4 in volume of 3.2m shares after the company issued a warning about lower third-quarter revenues. Canada TORONTO rebounded from earlier sluggishness to close well ahead as the market shed some of its post-election nervousness. Traders said they expect the TSE 300 index, which gained 31.9 at 4,187.1 yesterday, to continue improving on the back of the strength of US shares in recent days. An analyst commented that the gain 'reflected additional confidence in the economy and a move to catch up with Dow Jones'. Advances led declines by 366 to 327 after volume of 51.4m shares valued at CDollars 625.9m.</p>

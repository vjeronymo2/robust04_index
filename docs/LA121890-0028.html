			<p><P> December 18, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DEL MAR FAIRGROUNDS BEING EYED AS ARENA BY OWNER OF L.A. LAKERS  </P> <P> Jerry Buss, sports entrepreneur and owner of the Los Angeles Lakers basketball  team, has expressed interest in building a "world-class" sports arena at the  Del Mar Fairgrounds, operators of the facility said Monday.  </P> <P> Buss met last month in Encinitas with three members of the 22nd District  Agricultural Assn. board, which operates the fairgrounds, to discuss "the  construction and placement of a world-class facility," said Allan Royster, a  member of the board.  </P> <P> "It was an exploratory conversation at best," Royster said. "He was putting out  his feelers. He outlined his feelings for the San Diego area, which were very  positive. And he wanted to get a handle on our feelings about such a venture,  what the community reaction might be.  </P> <P> "But I get the feeling that he is looking at several other areas of the county  as well. It wasn't a conversation that went, 'You're my choice. This is what I  want to build and this is where I want to build it.' He was very casual."  </P> <P> Buss, 57, could not be reached for comment Monday. But Bob Steiner, public  relations director for California Sports Inc., the parent company for several  of Buss' sports ventures, said Del Mar is among several sites the owner has in  mind.  </P> <P> "If Mr. Buss has decided on a spot, he hasn't told me," he said. "As far as I  know, he hasn't narrowed down just where he'll put in his bid for a new  expansion team -- in Anaheim (in Orange County) or San Diego County.  </P> <P> "He just hasn't ruled anything out at this point."  </P> <P> Royster said that by the term world-class facility, he assumes that Buss' plans  call for building a multiuse arena such as the Forum, the facility Buss owns in  Inglewood that is home to two professional sports teams -- the Los Angeles  Lakers of basketball and the Los Angeles Kings of hockey -- as well as the site  of rock concerts and other special events.  </P> <P> "I assume he's got several uses in mind or he wouldn't be spending the kind of  money it takes to build such an arena," Royster said.  </P> <P> The Del Mar Fairgrounds has two construction projects under way and a third  scheduled to begin next year, he said.  </P> <P> A $5-million horse arena and a $13-million satellite wagering facility are both  due to be completed in 1991. Also next year, officials will begin building a  $107-million public grandstand.  </P> <P> Still, there's always room for another project, Royster said. "There are places  to build" a new arena, he said.  </P> <P> While the full board has yet to consider the issue, Royster said a new sports  arena would get his vote of approval.  </P> <P> Del Mar Mayor Jan McMillan said she has not received any word on the potential  project. "But if traffic problems increase," she said, "then it would be a big  problem."  </P> <P> For now, Royster said, officials are content to sit and wait for a decision.  </P></p>

			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / Silver tarnished SOTHEBY'S had a very disappointing silver sale in London yesterday. It totalled Pounds 574,695 but was almost 62 per cent unsold, mainly because the most important lot, a soup tureen made in 1736 by Paul de Lamerie, failed to find a buyer. Sotheby's was hoping for bids in excess of Pounds 750,000 for the rococo-styled tureen but it was bought in at Pounds 650,000.</p>

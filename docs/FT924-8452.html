			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / Comments sought on Sellafield plant HER MAJESTY'S Inspectorate of Pollution, which must approve the controversial new thermal oxide reprocessing plant (Thorp) before it can start up, will be issuing a draft authorisation for public comment. The authorisation is needed because Thorp will alter the emissions from the Sellafield site. Environmental lobbyists, who are trying to halt the new Pounds 1.8bn facility built by British Nuclear Fuels, will be pressing Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, to conduct a full hearing into the project. Mr John Guinness, BNF's chairman, said last night that he still hoped to receive authorisation for the start-up. However, he said the recent ruling that BNF could not load the facility until the go-ahead had been given, would cost the state-owned company Pounds 1m a week.</p>

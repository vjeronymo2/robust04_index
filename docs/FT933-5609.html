			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / UK calls for reform of EC social security systems THE BRITISH government is calling on European Community member states to reform their social security systems to cut the cost of employment, and for a radical review of all existing and proposed EC social legislation in the light of its impact on job creation. The proposals are contained in a UK Treasury and Department of Employment document submitted to the European Commission. The Copenhagen summit of EC leaders in June mandated Brussels to produce a white paper on growth, competitiveness and jobs for the Brussels summit this December, and the Commission yesterday began formal discussion on the subject in closed session. The UK call comes as EC countries including Germany, France and Belgium search for ways to lighten the cost to business of taking on workers. These are also the countries in the forefront of defending the EC's social charter  -signed by all except the UK in 1989 - and the Maastricht treaty's social chapter, from which Britain negotiated an opt-out. The UK document reminds its EC partners and Brussels that 'the world does not owe us a living'. EC treaty objectives of a 'high level of employment and social protection have to be earned; they are aspirations, not entitlements', it says. Although it insists repeatedly that 'there is no question of abandoning social protection', it argues that public social security and healthcare expenditure - at twice Japanese levels and 60 per cent more than in the US - have to be cut by more careful targeting of benefits, which should be scaled to price people into jobs. The document points out that in every economic cycle of the past three decades, the underlying level of EC unemployment has increased, in line with rising social security outlays. Labour markets are too rigid and are being made more so by EC social legislation, it argues. Europe's jobs crisis, Page 3</p>

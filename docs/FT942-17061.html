			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / Six telecoms operators gain licences The government gave a further boost to competition in the UK telecommunications market yesterday by awarding six licences to operators that could invest a total of Pounds 100m in the next few years. The licences will lead to new telecoms networks in London and Manchester. Videotron, a cable operator already building combined telephone and television networks in London, has been granted a telephony licence for Westminster and the City of London. It plans to start building a City telecoms network - the third City network under construction - immediately, with work starting in the Westminster area later this year. British Telecommunications holds the cable television licence for the area, its only TV franchise in the country. The granting of a licence to Norweb, the Manchester-based electricity distributor for the north-west of England, increases the stake of the privatised electricity companies in the telecoms industry. Norweb already offers a point-to-point telecoms service to large telecoms users in its region. It plans to expand its network, focusing particularly on the Manchester business market in association with Energis, the long-distance telecoms operator owned jointly by the 12 regional electricity companies in England and Wales. Energis is about to launch a long-distance network erected on the National Grid's pylons. The other four companies granted licences are Sprint and Worldcom, both significant US operators, Telstra, the Australian national operator, and Telia, the Swedish national operator. They propose to provide a range of resale services, including international resale, which could cut the cost of international calls sharply as reciprocal agreements are signed allowing the carriage of leased-line traffic across the public networks in the UK and the destination country.</p>

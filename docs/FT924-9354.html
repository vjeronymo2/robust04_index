			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / International Bonds: Demand for franc tempts French borrowers FRENCH borrowers are queueing up to take advantage of the international demand for their own currency. Three issuers tapped the market yesterday for a total of FFr3.1bn to be distributed abroad. Societe Generale led the biggest franc issue of the day for itself, a FFr1.5bn 10-year 8.5 per cent straight bond. Rival banks said the spread of 55 basis points over OATs was not over-generous, when compared with the 50 basis points spread paid by Banque Nationale de Paris on its FFr1.5bn five-year issue two weeks ago. Credit Commercial de France added to the small pool of French reverse floating-rate notes with a self-led FFr600m five-year issue. CCF said sales of the note would benefit from expected cuts in French franc interest rates. The coupon is 9 per cent for the first year, then 22.85 per cent minus twice six-month Paris interbank offer rate. Corporate borrowers are also eager to borrow at the best rates available for several years. Rhone-Poulenc is paying 71 basis points over OATs for FFr1bn on a seven-year straight bond, also arranged by CCF. In US dollars, two more issues were launched using the collared floater structure, which is seen as by far the most aggressive way of securing sub-Libor funding. The Kingdom of Norway, which has apparently been trying to get into the international capital markets since missing the Ecu boat in the summer, is raising Dollars 200m towards its public sector borrowing requirement. Its 10-year bond pays a coupon of 25 basis points below six-month Libor, subject to a minimum of 5 per cent and a maximum 8 1/2 per cent. Kidder Peabody is lead manager. Unlike Sweden and Finland, which have been active in the international markets, Norway escaped the recent currency traumas. The Dollars 50m eight-year issue for Bank Austria, led by Lehman Brothers and offering a minimum coupon of 5 per cent, maximum of 10 per cent, was thought to be expensive for a re-opening of an existing issue. In guilders, SBC Nederland said the two deals it launched were aimed at quite different markets. LKB Finance's tightly-priced Fl 200m five-year bond is aimed at the international market while SudwestLB's Fl 250m 10-year issue met far more domestic Dutch demand. Shell Oil has had its triple-A credit rating slashed by Moody's Investors Service, the US agency, affecting some Dollars 3bn of long-term debt. The agency's action leaves Shell two notches lower on the ratings ladder, at Aa2, though the company retains its triple-A classification from Standard &amp; Poor's.</p>

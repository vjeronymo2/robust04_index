			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / International Company News: Brokerage arm boosts earnings at Primerica RECORD earnings from Wall Street brokerage firm Smith Barney helped boost first-quarter earnings of Primerica, the US financial services group, by 27 per cent. Smith Barney's contribution of Dollars 29.3m made up more than a quarter of Primerica's net income of Dollars 105.9m, or 95 cents a share, which was up from Dollars 83.2m, or 73 cents a share, a year earlier. Primerica, controlled by Wall Street veteran Mr Sandy Weill, reported however, that sales of life insurance policies have continued to drop. The number of policies sold by its insurance brokerage subsidiary, Primerica Financial Services, tumbled to 79,500 in the quarter, from 122,700 a year earlier. The value of new policies issued dropped to Dollars 14.3m from Dollars 20.1m. None the less, improved margins helped lift the insurance brokerage unit's earnings by 11 per cent. Primerica Financial, formerly known as AL Williams, has the largest life insurance sales force in the US. Smith Barney attributed its 124 per cent jump in earnings to robust securities markets as well as lower expenses. Trading revenues jumped by 85 per cent and commissions by 16 per cent, thanks to growth in institutional and retail business. Primerica has been widely criticised for buying Smith Barney, one of Wall Street's most venerable firms, for twice its book value a few months before the 1987 market crash.</p>

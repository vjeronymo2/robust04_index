			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Prudential new UK business up 13% - Shares advance as market welcomes better-than-expected figures PRUDENTIAL Corporation, the life assurance group, reported a 13.3 per cent increase in UK new business last year. New business outside the UK, partly boosted by currency movements was up by 11.7 per cent, although most of this was accounted for by the sterling's devaluation. The market welcomed the figures, which were better than expected, and the shares closed at 296p, up 9p on the day. Single premium products performed far more strongly than regular premiums, which were damaged by low consumer confidence. Total UK single premium business increased from Pounds 1.41bn to Pounds 1.97bn, while annual premiums failed to keep up with inflation, rising from Pounds 320m to Pounds 325m. Mr Peter Nowell, group chief actuary, attributed the single premium rise to increased pension transfer business, caused by people moving jobs or taking early retirement. Annual life premiums fell from Pounds 136m to Pounds 126m, but life single premiums more than doubled to Pounds 846m. This was almost entirely due to sales of the Prudence Bond, the Prudential's single-premium with-profits bond, which took in Pounds 835m. Mr Roman Cizdyn, an analyst at Smith New Court, said that both pension transfers and the Prudence Bond should be more profitable than most single premium products, as it was difficult for customers to surrender the policies. The company's right to make a market value adjustment on pay-outs from the Prudence Bond meant that it should not impose a great capital strain, he said. Scottish Mutual, the life assurance company wholly owned by Abbey National saw total new business of Pounds 179.4m for 1992, up 29 per cent from 1991's Pounds 139.4m. Total single premiums rose 41 per cent to Pounds 158.1m, while regular premiums fell 21 per cent to Pounds 21.2m. This was a sharper drop than that experienced by the few companies which have so far reported, but Mr Cizdyn said he believed it would prove to be in line with the industry trend. United Friendly, the life assurance group, announced an increase in annual premium business from Pounds 20.6m to Pounds 25.9m. This change, starkly against the industry trend, was attributed to sharply increased agency sales. The company may also have benefited from switches from other companies, following the decision of some rivals to raise their minimum premiums. Single premium business, again helped by pension transfers, more than doubled from Pounds 20.4m to Pounds 41.9m. The shares rose 9p to close at 513p.</p>

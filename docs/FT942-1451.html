			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Chinese ask to adjourn Hong Kong talks A high-level meeting of British and Chinese diplomats discussing Hong Kong's future yesterday took a dramatic turn when the Chinese side requested a suspension of the talks until Monday. The two sides said the adjournment of the 29th meeting of the Joint Liaison Group was needed so that a sub-group negotiating the transfer of military land could have more time for agreement. It is believed the Chinese negotiating team needed time to refer to Beijing for fresh instructions after Britain refused to improve on its final offer. Today's meeting of a joint group discussing finance for Hong Kong's multi-billion-dollar airport project is unaffected by the suspension of the JLG, the first such interruption of a JLG session since it began talks in the mid-1980s. However, optimism about a settlement of airport financing at this meeting has given way to caution. In spite of encouraging remarks by senior Chinese government officials, a deal looks less certain, government officials said late yesterday. The issue of defence lands has proved one of the most difficult for Britain and China to resolve. For the past seven years the two have been negotiating about how many of the 39 military sites will go to the People's Liberation Army. The sticking-point in the present talks, raised late on Wednesday, is understood to be a Chinese demand that the British guarantee completion of more than HKDollars 3.5bn (Pounds 298m)-worth of work on PLA military facilities. These include the construction of a base for the Chinese navy. China has made this demand because the UK cannot guarantee that Hong Kong's Legislative Council (LegCo), which has to approve all government spending, will agree to vote the money as asked. British officials hope that China's new demand is simply a gambit by negotiators to show their superiors in Beijing that they have tried hard to secure the best deal possible. They see no chance of the UK Treasury underwriting the cost of Chinese military facilities. These officials point out that a failure to agree terms by July 6, when LegCo rises, means the Hong Kong government will be unable to finish the naval base by mid-1997 when sovereignty of Hong Kong passes to China. The British objective has been to get the Chinese military to accept as few of the military facilities in Hong Kong as possible. The UK also wants the PLA to accept that when military land becomes surplus to requirement, it should revert to the Hong Kong government for redevelopment. There is considerable unease in Hong Kong about the stationing of the PLA in the colony. Mr Deng Xiaoping, China's ailing leader, has decreed there will be a PLA presence in Hong Kong. It is generally assumed this force will number some 10,000 soldiers and a naval contingent whose strength is unknown.</p>

			<p><P> September 29, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> EMBARRASSING PADRES OWE DODGERS FOR DISMAL SHOWING AGAINST REDS  </P> <P> I just finished reading the article in The Times regarding Tony Gwynn's  difficult season and his relationship with his teammates.  </P> <P> It left me disgusted and ashamed at the immature behavior of his fellow Padre  players. How could these "grown" men act so childish, especially toward someone  who has been such a valuable part of the team for so many years?  </P> <P> All athletes, no matter how gifted, are prone to errors and slumps, both mental  and physical. When a player recognizes his weak points and adjusts his play  accordingly, can we really call him selfish? We should instead call him a  versatile competitor.  </P> <P> Grow up, little Padres!  </P> <P> Give 'em hell, Tony!  </P> <P> JIM FLEMING, North Hollywood  </P></p>

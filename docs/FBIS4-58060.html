			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by the Yemeni Socialist Party Political </F> Bureau in Aden on 29 April]    [Text] The political bureau of the Yemeni Socialist Party  [YSP] held a meeting on 29 April under the chairmanship of  Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid, the secretary general of the YSP  Central Committee and deputy chairman of the Presidential  Council. The meeting considered new developments in Yemen in  the wake of the deplorable military incidents which occurred  between the 1st Brigade and the 3d Brigade in 'Imran on 27 April.    The political bureau pointed out, in light of the  information  and data available to it, that the battles in 'Imran began with  an organized, planned, and premeditated attack by 1st Armored  Brigade forces from the 1st Armored Division. The attack was  supported by Republican Guard forces, central security troops,  and some tribal groups. The 3d Brigade was compelled to respond  to the treacherous attack. These deplorable, bloody battles led  to heavy material and human losses in all units engaged in the  fighting. The victims were innocent soldiers, sons of the one  Yemen, men from the same Yemeni Armed Forces. What made the  situation more atrocious was the unethical and unpatriotic  conduct towards the wounded on the part of the 3d Brigade. The  wounded troops were forced into cells and interrogated -- many  were tortured while they were still bleeding. These stupid acts  affected some members of the military commission, in particular  the detention and provocation of our brother Colonel 'Ali Naji  Ubayd, a member of the military commission and director of the  defense minister's office, who was in 'Imran as part of a  military commission that was attempting to calm the situation  before it exploded.    He, along with his brother members from the military  commission, have made tireless and mighty efforts to preserve  and secure the Armed Forces and indeed, the entire homeland,  against disastrous internecine warfare and destruction. The  matter did not end there. The positions of the 1st Brigade were  strengthened with new brigades from the Republican Guards and  the 1st Division, with the aim of continuing the attack and  besieging 3d Brigade positions. At the same time there were  intensive troop concentrations and reinforcements sent to  confront the Ba Suhayb Brigade, the 1st Artillery Brigade at  Yarim, and the 14th Brigade at al-Qama. They were also  positioned opposite al-Bayda, Mukayras, Ma'rib and Shabwah.    The political bureau linked the events at 'Imran, the  concentration of troops, and the new military reinforcements, to  events like the incidents at Abyan and Harf Sufyan, the  aggression against the Ba Suhayb Brigade in Dhamar, and the  threats and assassinations of members of the YSP in the northern  governorates. The movements of these party members were  monitored and their names written down on lists that were  prepared as a prelude to the assassinations. There were  attempts to close the headquarters of the party, such as that  witnessed in the Governorate of Hajjah.    The political bureau also linked this series of military  activities to the stupid, hysterical, propagandist, and  patched-up media campaigns waged by the media of the General  People's Congress and the Yemeni Alliance for Reform, against  the YSP and other patriotic parties.    These campaigns climaxed in a speech by the chairman of the  Presidential Council and the secretary general of the General  People's Congress on 27 April. The political bureau said the  president's speech was tantamount to a declaration of war.  Worse still, it was clear political and media preparation (?to  justify) the military attack against the 3d Brigade in 'Imran,  which occurred a few hours after the speech. The president's  speech blasted all the (?objectives) and concepts [word  indistinct] of national consensus, as well as the pledge and  accord document. It was characterized fabrications [word  indistinct] and abuse against the YSP, the other patriotic  parties, and the dialogue commission. The speech also contained  repugnant words and expressions which reason cannot countenance  as emanating directly from the president.    The political bureau stressed that the series of military  incidents and the escalation of media and political campaigns  were integral components of the same scenario [preceding word in  English] and design whose fundamental objective was to abort the  pledge and accord document, paralyze national unanimity, and  abort the activities of the dialogue commission, the military  commission, and the meetings of the Council of Ministers,  besides hindering all internal patriotic efforts. These  incidents are also intended to hinder Arab and international  efforts to tackle the crisis on nationalistic and democratic  grounds, and on the grounds created by the pledge and accord  document.    This design also aims to kill democracy in its cradle,  harming national unity and adopting the methods of political  annexation [ilhaq] and hegemony, while entrenching autocracy and  oligarchy at the expense of the higher interests of the people  and the homeland. It also aims to kindle the flames of civil  strife, and finally to drive the country towards a destructive  and [word indistinct] civil war which will destroy everything,  and threaten the homeland's unity and the people's gains and  achievements.    The YSP began as a unionist party from the inception of its  factions in the early 50's, and admirably fought the battles of  the national and social struggle for liberation and unity  against the rule of the imamate and colonialism. It gave up  many martyrs for the cause of the Yemeni revolutions of  September and October. It was behind the raising of the banner  of unity, and was at the vanguard to achieve unity on 22 May,  1990. It proposed democratic dialogue from the beginning as a  fundamental course for the development of Yemen's social  political system. The party espoused the slogan of reform, and  was the first to call for national dialogue [word indistinct]  with the other parties to conclude the pledge and accord  document. The party's glorious achievements and great  historical record truly outweigh these rabid attempts, which  vainly attempt to damage its history and patriotic symbols, and  to distort its national and social objectives. The YSP can only  stand with the people. It will pursue no other path except that  of unity, democracy and national consensus.    That was how it lived in the past with the people, that is  how it is at the present -- it will not be otherwise in the  future. Those who are swimming against the current of the times  and who are inclined to think of and return to the past, are the  same ones who pride themselves on past struggles and on an  honorable and brilliant past. But they are the same ones who  [words indistinct] the use of the pistol and terrorism [words  indistinct]. They are the same ones who still talk about the  interests of the homeland and the people from the very narrow  corner of their tribal and (?clannish) interests.    The YSP political bureau condemns all military acts of  aggression, and calls for stopping this deterioration  immediately. It also wishes to confirm the importance of the  following essential issues:    1. Stopping the deterioration of the situation and the  military build-up, because of the danger this poses to the  people and the homeland; releasing the men of the 3d Brigade and  stopping reinforcements and the military build-up against the 3d  Brigade, the 14th Brigade, and the Ba Suhyab Brigade;  (?removing) the military reinforcements confronting al-Bayda,  Abyan, Shabwah, and Ma'rib. There should be an immediate  investigation into the 'Imran events and other military  incidents preceding it. The results of that investigation  should be made public. Theos sides which are shown to be linked  to increasing tensions and engaging in military incidents should  be called to account. There should be a swift end to the  clashes between the brigades.    2. Swiftly implementing the pledge and accord document and  commencing upon those tasks connected with military security  aspects, due to their importance in preventing war. There  should be planning and preparation for a secure atmosphere in  which to implement the document. The brigades should withdraw  all the Armed Forces from the places which used to be called  border areas [atraf] and particularly from the governorates of  Ta'izz, Laj, Ibb, Abyan, Shabwah, al-Bayda and Ma'rib. Forces  should be withdrawn from towns, above all from Sanaa and Aden,  and the terrorist camps should be closed down. Military and  security forces should be redeployed and (?restationed), in  accordance with the stipulations of the pledge and accord  document.    3. The dialogue commission should draw up and publish a  timetable for implementing every task in the document. The  commission should assume responsibility for following up and  supervising these efforts. The commission should make public  the implementation's outcome at every step. It should publicly  condemn any side which behaves in a dilatory manner in the  implementation of the document. The dialogue commission ought  to fully undertake the role set out for it in the document. The  party rejects any attempt to marginalize the role of the  dialogue commission. The political bureau calls for the return  of the two brothers, Sinan Abu-Luhum and Mujahid Abu-Shawarib,  to exercise their tasks in the dialogue commission, as they have  a history of patriotism and prominent contribution to the  national dialogue within the framework of the dialogue  commission.    4. The dialogue commission should be vested with  responsibility for supervising the management of the news media,  and should be given the right to suspend any media programs or  activities which contradict the spirit of the pledge and accord  document, or which contribute to deepening the crisis and  inciting civil strife.    5. The political bureau calls on all patriotic parties and  social organizations, as well as all groups of people such as  workers, merchants, peasants, tribesmen and owners of national  capital, in addition to intellectuals, religious men, students,  and the security and armed forces, to rally their ranks to  contribute positively and effectively to preserving the union  and democracy, to reject war and internecine fighting, and to  demand the implementation of the pledge and accord document.  The party supports holding public sit-ins as a peaceful,  democratic and cultural approach for expressing the opinion of  the masses. It rejects any attempt to sabotage or hire the  masses to serve selfish or narrow group interests. Sparking off  war should be prevented. The implementation of the consensus of  national unanimity will be linked to the effectiveness of the  time-honored, patriotic and public accord.    6. The political bureau expresses appreciation for the role  of brothers and friends in containing the current crisis and  their assistance in tackling it with peace and democracy.    The political bureau welcomes the continuation of these  efforts to ensure concerted internal and external efforts  towards overcoming the crisis, preserving unity and democracy  and implementing the pledge and accord document so as to ensure  security and stability in Yemen and in the region generally.    Issued by the YSP Political Bureau, Aden.    [Dated] 29 April 1994.</p>

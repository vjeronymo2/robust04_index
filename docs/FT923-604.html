			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / People: Allday quits David Allday, 53, is taking early retirement as chief executive and deputy chairman of BRIDON, the maker of wire rope and other engineered products. He joined the group in May 1987 from the engineering group AE, which had been taken over by T&amp;N. He has had to grapple with decline in all of Bridon's main markets: construction, mining, fishing and offshore oil and gas. John West, the chairman of Bridon as well as of Dalgety, explains that 'he has had to push water uphill and he has had enough.' Because Allday chose to go - he was not pushed, West says - there was no great severance payment, even though he had about two years of his contract to run. West, who takes on some of Allday's relinquished responsibilities, says he is looking for a replacement with marketing and sales flair, as well as knowledge of the engineering industry. He said the situation at Bridon as 'fairly well under control'. A sevenfold improvement was recently reported in its first-half pre-tax profits to Pounds 700,000. Brian Clayton, managing director for Europe, will be responsible for day-to-day executive decisions. ***** Derek Foord, finance director of STAG FURNITURE HOLDINGS and chairman of Jaycee Furniture, is retiring. ***** Michael Wates has retired from the BRITISH BLOODSTOCK AGENCY.</p>

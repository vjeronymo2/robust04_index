			<p>BFN     [Text] On 3 April, Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina  departed for Uruguay, the first stop of a tour through five  South American countries, which will conclude on 19 April. In  statements to the press at Jose Marti International Airport,  Robaina said he will discuss with the authorities of the  countries he will visit the two summits scheduled for this year:  the Ibero-American Summit in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, and  the one in Miami convened by U.S. President William Clinton, in  which Cuba will not be participating.    Robaina described his visit to Paraguay, with which Cuba has  no diplomatic relations, as semiofficial, and said it will be  useful to expand mutual understanding. Foreign Minister Robaina  reiterated his wish for Cesar Gaviria's success as head of the  OAS, a post to which he was recently elected.</p>

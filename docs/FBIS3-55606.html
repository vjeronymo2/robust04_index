			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Second installment of interview with President Leonid </F> Kravchuk by UKRAYINSKA HAZETA Editor in Chief Valeriy Zholdak in  Kiev on 9 December: "Ukraine Will Be Independent and Strong"]    [Excerpts] The President Stakes His All on the Issue  of Nuclear-Free Status and Makes a New Statement Through  UKRAYINSKA HAZETA    [Zholdak] Leonid Makarovych, thank you very much for finding  time and responding to my request to meet with UKRAYINSKA HAZETA  and discuss issues that are of particular concern for the  Ukrainian people today. There is no doubt that these issues  also concern you as president, the first president of  independent Ukraine. Today, you, Mr. President, are bitterly  assailed from all sides -- by National Democrats, Social  Communists, and so-called Centrists. The common people also  criticize you (and not without reason). They have become  disillusioned by the present leadership and present government  due to the catastrophically declining standard of living. Let  us, Leonid Makarovych, speak openly.    [Kravchuk] Okay.    [Zholdak] UKRAYINSKA HAZETA also has and does criticize you,  if you have read its publications.    [Kravchuk] I have. I follow your newspaper's activity. I  like it.    [Zholdak] This is probably why you agreed to hold this  meeting, because our attacks on you do not involve insults or  pinning on labels. Our columnists, among whom, as you know,  there is one of the most authoritative, decent, and integral  Ukrainian figures -- Ihor Yukhnovskyy....    [Kravchuk] Yes.    [Zholdak] Our columnists assess what you are doing for  Ukraine's good and where you are failing....    [Kravchuk] You have a subjective view of things.    [Zholdak] No, Leonid Makarovych, we have an independent  point of view. We are not inclined to support a single party or  a single political force and, of course, we do not support the  opposition for that matter. Our position is as follows: Assist  the president, Supreme Council, government, and leaders of  institutions in their best deeds and be objective in assessing  their mistakes, failures, or even anti-Ukrainian actions.  UKRAYINSKA HAZETA only depends upon one thing -- Ukraine, its  independence, and the prosperity and well- being of the  Ukrainian people. All of our publications focus on two topics:  Who are we? Who leads us?    [Kravchuk] I share your aspirations.    [Zholdak] In order to keep this conversation to the point  and make it as frank as possible, I will tell you about my  attitude toward you, Leonid Makarovych. I have mixed feelings.  I feel primarily, gratitude. If you remember the year 1988  when the Kiev Ivan Franko Theater was preparing the performance  "Moment," the first in Ukraine based upon the works by the  "bourgeois" and, not very long ago, also nationalist, prominent  writer Volodymyr Vynnychenko. At that time you, as head of the  ideological department at Ukraine's Communist Party Central  Committee, were the only one to rescue the first show.    [Passage omitted on cultural issues]    [Zholdak] Let us start with what is particularly important  for the fate of Ukrainian independence -- its national security.  The preceding issue of UKRAYINSKA HAZETA, if you read it,  carried an interview with Yuriy Kostenko, head of the working  deputies' group on preparing for the ratification of START I and  Ukraine's nuclear-free status. Yuriy Kostenko is Ukraine's  people's deputy and Ukraine's minister of environmental  protection.    [Kravchuk] I read it thoroughly.    [Zholdak] In particular, it expresses disagreement, Mr.  President, with your position regarding the immediate transfer  of all the nuclear weapons to Russia.    [Kravchuk] My position on this point is final and  invariable.    [Zholdak] In our interview with Kostenko, we quoted your  letter to U.S. President George Bush of 7 May 1992 in which you  informed the American president that you were trying to urgently  transfer to Russia all the nuclear weapons from Ukraine --  tactical in 1992 and strategic -- by 1994. Did you make such a  commitment?    [Kravchuk] In that letter nobody made such a commitment.  The entire letter should have been read. I wrote something  else. I wrote that Ukraine would do what is envisaged by START  and by the Statement on Ukraine's Nuclear-Free Statement, which  was adopted by our Supreme Council.    [Zholdak] Why are you in such a hurry to transfer everything  at one go? Russia has not paid us a cent for the tactical  weapons that have already been transferred there.    [Kravchuk] The point is that even now I believe that we must  transfer our nuclear weapons as soon as possible. However, of  course, you are right, we must get compensation for our expenses.    [Zholdak] They [Russia] will not give compensation for  anything!    [Kravchuk] Why not? We have already reached an agreement  with Russia on strategic weapons. We have signed an agreement.    [Zholdak] However, that agreement applies to strategic  weapons. We have received nothing for tactical ones. In the  opinion of our and foreign specialists, they are worth billions  of U.S. dollars.    [Kravchuk] Negotiations are now under way on the tactical  weapons as well. There is an agreement in principle on  compensation for those weapons, too.    [Zholdak] Cannot you, like Russia, also put pressure upon  them and fight for our good?    [Kravchuk] We are fighting within the limits of our  possibilities and law. However, you see, the oil- and gas tap  is on the other side. So far, we are deeply in debt. Generally  speaking, putting pressure means a policy from a position of  strength.    [Zholdak] Leonid Makarovych, you received the belated  telegram from Yeltsin regarding the ratification of START I by  Ukraine.    [Kravchuk] Yes, I did.    [Zholdak] Our press wrote much about it. One newspaper even  quoted the telegram and asserted that Mr. Yeltsin humiliated you  and set an ultimatum to the effect that all the strategic  weapons be transferred to Russia within two years. Can you read  this telegram to me or give it to me to publish in UKRAYINSKA  HAZETA? Or is it a secret?    [Kravchuk] No, there is nothing secret about it. However,  it is a personal letter. Why make it public? It is not for  publishing.    [Zholdak] However, the Ukrainian people must know that the  Ukrainian president is bound hand and foot. Here, I take your  side and do not want you to be humiliated.    [Kravchuk] Nobody is bound. Let us analyze the situation  soberly. Yeltsin's letter deals with two aspects.    [Zholdak] Is it a letter or a telegram?    [Kravchuk] A letter telegram. It was meant as a telegram,  but arrived as a letter.    [Zholdak] Excuse me, Leonid Makarovych, how does this letter  telegram start? Esteemed Comrade President? Highly esteemed  Mr. President?    [Kravchuk] What difference does it make?    [Zholdak] It is very interesting.    [Kravchuk] He writes: "Dear Leonid Makarovich."    [Zholdak] Oh, this is good!    [Kravchuk] No, this does not mean that this word determines  the policy.    [Zholdak] Well, there are two aspects in the letter.    [Kravchuk] Two aspects. First. He analyzes the situation  that has taken shape after the ratification of START I by the  Supreme Council and thinks that this cannot be considered as a  ratification.    [Zholdak] Whose situation does he analyze? The one that has  taken shape in Ukraine or in Russia?    [Kravchuk] In the world.    [Zholdak] Why does he consider our parliament's decision  wrong?    [Kravchuk] Because it deviates from the promises that were  previously made by Ukraine's Supreme Council and by Ukraine in  signing the Lisbon Protocol. It is true. We did deviate from  our promises. Here, we must call a spade a spade. It was not  my decision to deviate. I insist that we must be consistent.  In my opinion, the Supreme Council did things that I consider  to be short-sighted for Ukraine. Our state's international  prestige has been seriously undermined.    [Zholdak] Leonid Makarovych, the Lisbon Protocol was not  signed by you as president and head of our state responsible for  Ukraine's well-being, but by Mr. Zlenko, the country's minister  of foreign affairs.    [Kravchuk] This does not matter, because we are dealing with  a certain status of the document.    [Zholdak] How come it does not matter? Why, in that case,  is there any need for the Supreme Council's decision? It must  ratify or refuse to ratify that protocol. This is world  practice. I believe that the minister's signature is legally  not valid. The Supreme Council has the right to either ratify  or not ratify, to do either one or the other.    [Kravchuk] The right must be used in the interests of the  state.    [Zholdak] Was it not ratified in the interests of the state,  with demands that we must receive compensation for different  things? That we must get international security guarantees? Was  that a bad thing to do, Mr. President?    [Kravchuk] Am I saying anything against it? However, it was  also necessary to ratify the NNT.    [Zholdak] The what?    [Kravchuk] NNT -- that we join the Nuclear Nonproliferation  Treaty.    [Zholdak] Is this the fifth item?    [Kravchuk] Yes. I am not saying that the Supreme Council  was wrong to make those reservations. However, it depends on  which of them. I agree with some of them, while others are  fundamentally at variance with our previously determined  position.    [Zholdak] However, if we had endorsed that fifth item of the  Lisbon Protocol, we would have agreed juridically that we did  not possess nuclear weapons, and then we would have been  rejected like worn-out horses.    [Kravchuk] How do you mean we do not possess nuclear  weapons?    [Zholdak] This is what is written there.    [Kravchuk] It is written there that we do not spread nuclear  weapons.    [Zholdak] If we sign it, Russia will get the right to remove  anything it wants from our territory. Knowledgeable specialists  told me about this.    [Kravchuk] That is what they are saying. You had better  listen to what I tell you.    [Zholdak] Yes.    [Kravchuk] Has Russia joined the protocol?    [Zholdak] It has.    [Kravchuk] It has joined the protocol. Have Belarus and  Kazakhstan joined it? Yes, they have. All states have joined,  and Ukraine has not done so. Why? How will you explain this to  people? That you are in favor of the proliferation of nuclear  weapons? Tell me how you are going to spread them. Or explain  to me that nonsense one hears from the lips of both  ultra-left-wing and ultra-right-wing chatterboxes to the effect  that we can change the codes of our warheads. I want to ask you  my first and main question. These are not abstract notions. Do  you want to retarget them against the United States, or Russia,  or France? There is no such thing as abstract coding. The  missiles are presently targeted against the United States.    [Zholdak] Yes.    [Kravchuk] However, the button is in Russia. Do you  understand?    [Zholdak] Yes.    [Kravchuk] This means that, today, I, as president, have  nuclear weapons, but I do not control them.    [Zholdak] We have them as a dangerous tenant?    [Kravchuk] For me, they only constitute danger. I know that  the button is "there." That is why I am saying: Why don't we  deactivate these weapons, and demand compensation for them, and  give them away? We will never use them. Everybody must realize  this.    [Zholdak] At the same time, Mrs. Thatcher said that this is  protection and that this is deterrence against attacks.    [Kravchuk] In what way?    [Zholdak] If we have these formidable weapons, we will not  be attacked.    [Kravchuk] But I told her. Suppose, you have a stick.    [Zholdak] Yes.    [Kravchuk] A cue. It is yours. At present, a person who  sits there in the reception room holds it. Tell me, will you be  able to use it?    [Zholdak] No.    [Kravchuk] Then why prattle, excuse me for the word? I have  missiles that I cannot use.    [Zholdak] What can we do to make them usable for us?    [Kravchuk] It is un-re-a-lis-tic! [hyphens as published].    [Zholdak] That is why you did not want the Supreme Council's  decision not [as published] to specify 36 and 42 percent of the  initial reduction of nuclear weapons?    [Kravchuk] This is all nonsense, because when the service  life of the warheads expires, we will transfer them irrespective  of decrees or edicts. Nobody will allow a tragedy to happen.  When I gathered all scientists that could be found in this  sphere and we discussed this question twice at the Security  Council, the scientists proved in detail that it is the  manufacturer alone who can change anything. We in Ukraine do  not manufacture the warheads. Russia does. The manufacturing  plant installs a code and nobody else in the world knows it.    [Zholdak] I see.    [Kravchuk] We can remove the warhead and put it aside "for  storage."    [Zholdak] And launch....    [Kravchuk] Never. A missile may be launched, but there will  be no nuclear explosion. Because this is encoded and the codes  are in Moscow. Well, this is common knowledge. Moreover, every  part has its own service life. The fact that the Supreme  Council did not ratify.... I reiterate, suppose that tomorrow  the period of safe physical life of a missile expires.... They  may refuse to ratify, I do not care. I will remove these  warheads! I am making this statement through UKRAYINSKA HAZETA.  Because, tomorrow, it may be too late and, tomorrow, something  irreparable may happen. It will not be your responsibility  and not the responsibility of the Supreme Council as a  legislative organ, but of the president who allowed this to  happen.    [Zholdak] You have made very strong statements, Leonid  Makarovych.... I am already inclined to believe that this is  what should be done....    [Kravchuk] I am telling you how things really are. By  comparison with what may happen in connection with the nuclear  weapons, Chernobyl was child's play. I do not want to  intimidate anybody. We have 176 missiles, and every warhead is  such a terrible force that is hard to imagine.    [Zholdak] As you are saying, one of them may explode on its  own if its "death" comes?    [Kravchuk] Well, we will not allow this to happen, because  we will ensure technological supervision. However, there are  time limits beyond which the warheads acquire a difficult state.  Then I will turn to Russia: "Take them away!" To this,  specialists may say: "We will not go there. It is already  dangerous." That's it! Do anything you want with them. Then  you will give them away and beg to have them taken, but they  will not be taken.    [Zholdak] I see.    [Kravchuk) These are such complicated things, and should not  be resolved through emotions or in an unprofessional manner.  One can declare with pride: "We have nuclear weapons, and we  are strong!" Those who say so realize that, today, Ukraine  cannot use its nuclear weapons.    [Zholdak] It appears then that it is pointless to hope that  we may leave at least one missile to intimidate somebody?    [Kravchuk] Absolutely! There is, however, one thing, if we  approach this problem realistically. We can see how we can use  the launchers for peaceful purposes. I reiterate that nuclear  weapons cannot be used by our country. We are driving ourselves  into a deadlock. Why? I will tell you. Every nuclear state  manufactures its own nuclear weapons.    [Zholdak] We cannot manufacture them on our own?    [Kravchuk] No, we cannot, because we do not have a nuclear  industry. In order to create a nuclear industry, we need many  years and tens of billions of karbovantsi.    [Zholdak] In order to manufacture them and to build a plant?    [Kravchuk] A plant.    [Zholdak] Tens of billions.... This.... This is, so far,  unrealistic for us....    [Kravchuk] This may be achieved in 15 years.    [Zholdak] We will have this much money?    [Kravchuk] No, if this question arises and the entire  economy is aimed at this, as well as the resources and the  people's efforts.... And if there is also money, then we could  handle this.... The enrichment of uranium.... Control.... In  that case, the state does everything on its own. Nobody sells  nuclear weapons to anybody. It is not a rifle. A state that  proclaims itself as nuclear, must have the entire nuclear cycle.  By its decree, the Supreme Council has, in fact, proclaimed  Ukraine's nuclear status. On what grounds? We are not a nuclear  power. We only have the nuclear weapons that we have inherited.  The world and Yeltsin are saying: Once you have proclaimed  yourselves as a nuclear power, take upon yourselves all the  relevant responsibilities. Can you service your nuclear  weapons? No. Can you create them? No. Do you have  technological provision or spare parts? No. What do you want  then? What can I say to that? Nothing.    [Zholdak] Is this what Yeltsin wrote to you?    [Kravchuk] Not in these words, but this is the meaning.  Another thing. He wrote about the consequences of all of this  for Russia. If you are a nuclear power, then why should we  service your nuclear complexes? You must do that on your own.  What do we need all those intricacies for? You have not joined  the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, whereas Russia has. By  helping you, we will be in violation of the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty. For my part, I am telling him: We  want compensation. For us, this is the main issue. So that  there is no recurrence of our transferring our weapons for free.  After all, it is the people's work. Both tactical and  strategic weapons cost something. Let us resolve these issues:  One -- compensation, and the other -- security for our  statehood....    [Zholdak] They will agree and then deceive us.    [Kravchuk] Well, if we proceed from this, then not a single  document can be signed. This is not serious. The third  condition is financial and technological assistance. Three  aspects. Shall we resolve them? Then we will proceed further,  and the Supreme Council will return to this question. I am sure  of it.    [Zholdak] Did you say that to him?    [Kravchuk) To him and to Clinton.    [Zholdak] You have already answered his [Yeltsin's] letter?    [Kravchuk] Of course. I wrote and also said this in a  conversation.    [Zholdak] What kind of letter was that of Yeltsin's?  Benevolent? Without any ultimatums?    [Kravchuk] There were no ultimatums. He reasons what and  how could be done. That he is concerned. That the world may  look upon Ukraine as a state that may be blamed for halting  nuclear disarmament. You know what they say and write abroad:  You have not joined the treaty, you have, in fact, failed to  ratify the treaty, and, therefore, you stand in the way of total  nuclear disarmament. START I is followed by START II. If  historians start analyzing, believe me, we will be accused of  causing political and military tension on our planet. You will  not be able to prove anything to hi-sto-ry.    [Zholdak] It is, however, suspicious that America is so keen  on our disarmament. It does not disarm itself and, while being,  perhaps, the strongest nuclear power, it puts pressure upon us  not to allow us to be a nuclear power. Even though we are now  economically weak, our military armor and guns are powerful.  That is why they [the Americans] are preoccupied with us like  big dogs with a nice little cat. The cat has sharp claws. If  these claws are cut off, we will do what they want us to do or  else we will be punished. We also want to be a strong state.  We deserve it.    [Kravchuk] There is also much I would like to have.  However, we must think soberly. The missiles deployed in  Ukraine are targeted against America.    [Zholdak] That is so.    [Kravchuk] They know that the button is in Moscow. There is  economic chaos both here and there. There is also political  chaos. The Americans fear that this chaos may be dangerous for  the world and for peace. It may occur to somebody.... When  there is stability, order, discipline, and scientific  supervision, it is a different matter. They are afraid. I  understand them. I told Clinton that we are ready to deactivate  our warheads and leave them in Ukraine. Not to transfer, but to  store them here.    [Zholdak] Will they be safer then?    [Kravchuk] To begin with, safer, and I will know that the  button will not be used by somebody somewhere to launch these  missiles from the territory of Ukraine. I am responsible before  the world. These are ideas and assumptions. We will do  everything to prevent this from ever happening, but we must take  into account other countries' fears.    [Zholdak] This is not bad. We can arrive at such a  decision: Either you or the Supreme Council?    [Kravchuk] Yes, we can! However, we want some steps to be  made toward us. We want other countries to trust us, and I will  do everything I can to achieve this trust and get some normal  assistance without humiliating conditions, an economic  assistance and normal attitude not only because we possess  nuclear weapons. We must see to it that Ukraine is looked upon  as a country with high culture, science, and a large economic  potential, which may be put into effect. To make first steps.  We will make them, too. We will start working in a civilized  manner and with respect for one another.    [Zholdak] Leonid Makarovych, they [the Americans] do not  really want to help us. They promise us $175 million.  According to estimates made by specialists, up to 2 billion is  necessary for disarmament. Nobody will give us that much money.  Our state treasury is empty. What difference will it make if  the Supreme Council does adopt a decision, which you, Yeltsin,  Clinton, and the whole world expect?    [Kravchuk] After adopting such a decision, we could raise  the question of money. We want it like in [Ilf and Petrov's]  "Twelve Chairs" [on a blue-bordered plate -- without any effort  on our part]. I already said this at the Supreme Council  session: If chairs are handed over in the morning, then money  must be paid [the previous] evening, or, if the chairs are  handed over in the evening, then money is received [the  previous] morning, but money first.    [Zholdak] Did you speak to Clinton here, from your office?    [Kravchuk] This is the telephone through which I spoke to  Clinton.    [Zholdak] How did he talk to you? Politely or as a dictator?    [Editorial note] To be continued in the next issue.</p>

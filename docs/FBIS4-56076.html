			<p>BFN     [Text] Last night, General Michael Rose, commander of the  UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] in Bosnia-Herzegovina, held  talks with President of the Presidency Alija Izetbegovic on the  implementation of the cease-fire and the deployment of peace  forces on the east bank of the Drina River near Gorazde. This  was announced today at the UNPROFOR command in Sarajevo.    General Rose proposed that Bosnia-Herzegovina Army units  should withdraw from the east bank of the Drina River and that  UNPROFOR units should be deployed in their place to protect  Gorazde and maintain the cease-fire. On the basis of UN  Security Council Resolution 913 and the NATO ultimatum,  Bosnia-Herzegovina Army units are not obliged to withdraw from  either this part of town or the 3-km exclusion zone around  Gorazde. UNPROFOR representative Major Annink said that the  NATO ultimatum was still in force. We [words indistinct] the  situation realistically and we are trying to solve the problem  in Gorazde through negotiations, said Major Annink today. He  added that General Rose yesterday attempted to talk to the  aggressor's leader Radovan Karadzic, but that he had not  succeeded in this.</p>

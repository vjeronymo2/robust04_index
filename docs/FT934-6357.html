			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Kewill recovery continues with profits at Pounds 1.76m Recovery at Kewill Systems continued despite poor trading conditions and the software supplier said it should return to the dividend list by the end of the trading year. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.76m for the six months to September 30 compared with losses of Pounds 172,000, restated for FRS 3. Kewill had previously been expanding vigorously but high costs and management problems at a German subsidiary resulted in several months of reduced profits; the subsidiary has since been sold to its management. Mr Kevin Overstall, chairman, said yesterday's results revealed the group's underlying strength. The City, however, marked the shares down 7p to 253p. Turnover from continuing operations was Pounds 16m, compared with Pounds 14.2m. Operating profit rose 29 per cent from Pounds 1.53m to Pounds 1.97m, while earnings per share were 10.15p (losses of 3.58p). Mr Overstall said the company had been successful in petitioning the High Court to sanction a capital reduction to eliminate the deficit on distributable reserves; in consequence the company should be in a position to declare a dividend with its full year results. He said prospects for the second half would be constrained by economic conditions in the UK but that US operations, which doubled operating profits in the first half of the year, were expected to grow strongly.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Approximately 100 people were killed or injured  yesterday during an air attack against Herat city.    A Bakhtar Information Agency correspondent reports from  Herat  city that two jets belonging to Dostam's militia bombed the  crowded parts of Herat city yesterday. As a result, eight  civilians were killed and around 90 people--including women and  children--were injured.    The report adds that this savage attack occurred on the eve  of a meeting of the country's governors in Herat and was an  attempt to undermine this meeting. It was reported that the  meeting is scheduled to be held in two days--on 28 June. In  addition to the country's governors, a number of social and  scientific personalities from in and out of Afghanistan will  attend it. It is expected that a number of leaders of the  jihadi groups will also participate.</p>

			<p><P> July 11, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RAMS' CAMP TO OPEN IN EXPERIMENTAL MODE  </P> <P> Finding themselves submerged in a dynasty not their own, the Rams will open a  training camp for rookies today knowing that all good things and teams must  end. So is this the year or will San Francisco party again?  </P> <P> More anxious than even Steve Young for quarterback Joe Montana to retire, the  Rams are rebounding from their championship game knockout last January to  presume again that the best days of the 49ers too shall pass, preferably  against someone else's defensive secondary.  </P> <P> The Rams were quite the compliment collectors after last season's entertaining  title run, emerging as possibly the NFL's second-best team -- small  consolation.  </P> <P> For sanity's sake, the Rams pretend not to notice their northern rivals in  July, prefering self-examination.  </P> <P> "I don't think they're the issue," Coach John Robinson said of the 49ers,  resurrecting a familiar training camp tone. "I think they're the issue for  external people, not for us.  </P> <P> "We've got to start this year -- and win the championship this year -- against  all of the teams that we play. What we're striving to do is become a  championship-level football team, not just focus on beating one team."  </P> <P> Come December, though, the teams are inevitably linked because of their  distinct rivalry and a divisional title they seek each season.  </P> <P> Robinson, in fact, calculates precisely a San Francisco mean streak that has  produced consecutive Super Bowl titles. He notes accurately that the 49ers have  won 24 of their last 27 games since a midseason slump in 1988.  </P> <P> "And we're two of those losses," he adds. "And certainly there was another one  of those we could have won. We've played them four times (during the regular  season) in that period and won twice. And it's been a phenomenal period, but it  won't go on. But we cannot spend our time looking at someone else. We must  spend our time looking at ourselves and improving ourselves."  </P> <P> Still, each measure of self-improvement is always in part a response to the  maneuverings of the 49ers. The difference is that the Rams play their game of  chess with limited funds, looking for garage-sale bargains while the 49ers  spend money from their owner's fancy shopping malls.  </P> <P> This past off-season, the Rams signed free-agent quarterback Chuck Long, a  former sore-armed, first-round draft choice of the Detroit Lions who never  panned out. If Long pays off in Anaheim, he's the insurance policy answer to  Young, San Francisco's talented backup. Young earns $1 million a season; Long,  $400,000.  </P> <P> Next, Robinson reached into the Plan B market, plucking tailback Curt Warner  from Seattle, where he gained only 631 yards last season. At his best, Warner  was among the game's elite runners. At 29, he battles doubts and leg injuries.  </P> <P> Robinson is hoping that Warner, a passionate player and leader, will replace  the emotionless statistical offerings of Greg Bell, who gained few yards in the  clubhouse diplomacy game. Robinson sent Bell to the Raiders.  </P> <P> The Warner experiment, too, was cost-effective. They'll pay him less than  $800,000 for the chance he'll bring to the Rams what veteran John Riggins  brought to Washington after a late-career trade from the New York Jets.  </P> <P> "It could be a mistake," Robinson said of the Warner deal. "But I don't think  it's a gamble. It didn't cost us anything. We didn't pay anything. We didn't  give away a draft choice. Sports has millions of outstanding players who  somebody said they're careers were over. Then, they make a move and there's an  immediate resurgence. One could say that the jury's out. But it's not  ill-conceived. It has a chance for some real success."  </P> <P> If Warner fails or is injured, the running load is plopped into the lap of  inexperience. Cleveland Gary's rookie season was a wash in 1989 after he  reported to camp less than a week before the opener. Gaston Green's career has  been a wash since the Rams made him their top pick in 1988.  </P> <P> Robinson insists that Green has matured as a runner and will get a shot this  summer. But time is running out on this costly investment.  </P> <P> "For us it is," Robinson admitted. "I don't mean that as any kind of threat or  anything. We've either got to use him or find a way for him to get somewhere  where he can use his strengths. No question, he is physically different now  than when he came. He wants desperately to play, (and) we're going to try to  give him that opportunity. . . .  </P> <P> "We're just going to have to wait and see. Who knows about injuries? There's  some question about Curt. Some people say he's all washed up. You don't know.  There are three guys. I have three tailbacks all trying to prove themselves  this year. So we will have some healthy competition."  </P> <P> Nothing on offense compares to the competition on defense, where waves of young  talent fight for a few positions. The Rams ranked 21st overall on defense and  28th against the pass, although serious and numerous injuries last season  muddled the true picture a bit. The Rams played the title game without six top  defenders, but vast improvement on defense remains a must if the Rams wish to  contend. In short, the wealth of talent acquired in the drafts of 1988 and '89  must soon produce. The Rams were fortunate last season to get quality time from  free-agent linebacker Brett Faryniarz and seventh-round linebacker George  Bethune.  </P> <P> Some of the young defenders on the hot-seat this season are linebacker Frank  Stams, safety Anthony Newman and linemen Bill Hawkins and Brian Smith.  </P> <P> "I think we have to improve," Robinson said. "But I like the cast of  characters. There's just a lot of unproven people. The scary thing would be to  have a mediocre group and have them all back."  </P> <P> Robinson envisions multiple defensive schemes and alignments this season to  take advantage of all his personnel.  </P> <P> The Rams, for example, have a strong run defense led by nose man Alvin Wright  and ends Doug Reed and Mike Piel. But that unit gets burned too often on  first-down passes. Robinson hopes to improve the situation by using either one  or both of his twin towers, Smith and Hawkins, on early downs. Both are  6-feet-6 and about 270 pounds. Hawkins and Smith also will team up as inside  rushers on passing downs, and the hope is that the tandem will take some  pressure off the secondary and the team's only true pass-rusher, Kevin Greene.  </P> <P> "Our outside rush is OK," Robinson said. "Inside is where we need the help. In  Minnesota, for example, (Keith) Millard is coming at you with the pass rush all  the time. We're going to try to move in that direction."  </P> <P> Ram Notes  </P> <P> The Rams signed their 10th-round choice, defensive end Stephen Bates, Tuesday.  He and sixth-round receiver Tim Stallworth are the only draft chices to sign so  far. Bates, from James Madison, may be tried at linebacker.  </P> <P> Safety Anthony Newman (elbow), defensive end Doug Reed (ankle), safety Vince  Newsome (ankle) and defensive tackle Mike Piel (elbow) have recovered fully  from injuries suffered late last season, Coach John Robinson said. Defensive  tackle Bill Hawkins still isn't 100% after undergoing arthroscopic knee surgery  in December, but he is expected to be practicing at full speed by Aug. 1. The  news isn't so good for third-year cornerback Cliff Hicks, who suffered knee  damage last season. He is not expected back until September at the earliest.  </P> <P> Two roster positions open this summer are at fourth wide receiver and punter.  Veteran Hank Ilesic and rookie Kent Elmore figure to battle for Dale Hatcher's  old punting job. . . . The veterans will report to training camp at UC Irvine  on July 26. The Rams were forced out of Cal State Fullerton this year because  construction has begun on a campus sports complex. . . . The team will spend  two weeks at Rams Park before opening camp in Irvine, then leave a week later  for an Aug. 11 exhibition game against the Kansas City Chiefs in Berlin.  </P> <P> The Rams are the first NFL team to report to camp. It might be a while before  the team's top three draft choices -- Bern Brostek, Pat Terrell and Latin Berry  -- agree to terms. The Rams also have seven conditional free-agent veterans yet  to sign, most notably Pro Bowl linebacker Kevin Greene, who has recorded 33  sacks over the last two seasons. The others are linebacker Brett Faryniarz,  tight ends Pete Holohan and Damone Johnson, safety Michael Stewart, nose tackle  Alvin Wright and defensive end Doug Reed.  </P></p>

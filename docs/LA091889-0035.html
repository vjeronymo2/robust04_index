			<p><P> September 18, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANIMAL RESEARCH  </P> <P> Nuland is wrong when he says that "all the rights groups exist to stop all  research on animals." We only want to end those experiments that are fraudulent  and cause needless suffering and death in animals and humans alike. On second  thought, Nuland is right. That is all animal research.  </P> <P> BILL DYER  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 6, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CURB-SIDE RECYCLING TO START  </P> <P> Curb-side recycling of newspapers and metal and glass containers will begin  Dec. 4 in Manhattan Beach under a plan unanimously approved Tuesday by the City  Council.  </P> <P> California Conservation Corps workers will fan out throughout the city on Nov.  13 to distribute a 14-gallon container to each household, according to David  Ludwig, who is in charge of the program for the city.  </P> <P> Residents can toss all recyclable goods into the one container, which will be  emptied the same day their other trash is picked up.  </P> <P> Ludwig said the program will initially cost each household 70 cents a month.  However, if more than 50% of the city's residents participate in the program,  the charge will drop to 20 cents.  </P> <P> The city expects to spend $1,000 a month to publicize the program, according to  Ludwig. To further promote the program, the city will not renew salvage permits  held by three companies when they expire next year.  </P> <P> "We learned from some of the other (recycling) programs around that their two  main disadvantages were they were not well-publicized, and scavenging  (prohibition) was not as well enforced as it should have been," Ludwig said.  </P></p>

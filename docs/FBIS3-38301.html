Like nervous stock exchange operators,  they follow the Russian exchange rate movements. The  irreversibility of the reforms used to be a dogma. But now,  trying to convince oneself no longer works -- the load is  tipping over. When he meets President Clinton, Kohl will be  very concerned.    Bonn gets the impression that the Western superpower is  about  to change its course: The shift toward subsidizing the huge  arms industry, Kozyrev's move toward a Tsarist-Stalinist policy  of spheres of influence, the deliberate destabilizing of  Ukraine, and the return of the nomenclature in Belarus have led  to heated discussions in the United States.    Has Kohl's forecast of the reforms been any better? This is  rather doubtful. Who kissed Yeltsin? What worries the  chancellor are the abrupt shifts in U.S. judgment. Under the  State Department's influence, Clinton opted for a strict "Russia  first." The Central Eastern Europeans were kept at a distance  from NATO with the airy Partnership for Peace program. In  Moscow, Clinton gave a blank check to the policy of spheres of  influence: He said that Moscow's interference in Georgia could  have a stabilizing effect, just like the United States'  interference in Panama and Grenada.    That was tempting. When Kozyrev added to this with his  comment on Russian spheres of interest, Washington warned of a  new hegemony. Clinton's friend Talbott had to swallow his words.  First he said that Russia needs "less shock, more therapy."  After the fall of the reformers, he said: "Reforms first, then  assistance."    Contradictions bring confusion into politics. Will Kohl be  able to fix anything?</p>

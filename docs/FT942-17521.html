			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / Financial Times Round the World Ski Expedition: Skiing through a packed lunch Arnie Wilson and Lucy Dicker are trying to ski every day of 1994 on a round-the-world expedition. They began the year in North America and moved to Europe in the middle of March. We have come a long way since we skied Cloudmont, Alabama in torrential rain on March 1. In the past few days we have hurtled down the slopes of St Anton, Lech and Zurs under a cobalt blue sky and Sagamore - and a host of other strange towns in the US - seems like a dream to us now. During our final fortnight in the US we passed through places such as Accident, Mechanicsville, Krumsville and even Ambridge. But since arriving in Austria we have driven far less and skied far more, catching up on some of the backlog in our effort to ski 5,000 miles during our year on the slopes. If we could spend the whole of 1994 in Europe we could ski 5,000 miles with comparative ease. However with the prospect of glacier skiing, when the snow is hardly skiable after mid afternoon, and skiing out of season in the Himalayas and Japan, our target is likely to slip further from our grasp. After leaving Alabama for North Carolina, a look out of the window in Maggie Valley (named after a former postman's daughter), told us all we wanted to know: it was still raining. We guessed it would rain all day - and it did. We braced ourselves for an uncomfortable day skiing at Cataloochee knowing that at least it had a more respectable vertical drop - 730 vertical feet - than we had found in some other southern and mid-west resorts. The next day managed to be worse: fresh snow on the ground, freezing rain and thick fog in the air. Hunched nervously over the wheel of our huge white limousine from Indianapolis, which was not equipped with winter tyres or front-wheel drive, and peering through the windscreen for any sign at all of the outside world, we slithered past the entrance to Sugar Mountain without even seeing it, and climbed higher into the fog. 'Where is this damn mountain?' I asked Lucy desperately. Any mountain would have done - so we made do with Beech Mountain, which we chanced upon. We didn't care that a number of unhappy skiers were queueing to demand their money back - we were at last going to get our skis on snow. Conditions were, however, unusually difficult: icy patches, strong winds, and a resort anxious to capitalise on the sudden low temperatures by switching on all the snow cannon. But the thick fog meant the cannon were invisible. Skiing quietly and listening like mad was the only way of avoiding a faceful of icy snow or even a collision with a snow gun. For the third day running, all thoughts of trying to catch up with our miserable mileage were lost in the gloom. We found Sugar Mountain when at last the sun came out. By lingering there into the night and going back for more the next day, we clocked up 25 miles in our two visits. This was more like it. But on the road, things were still not going well. In The Virginias, Lucy plotted a course from Snowshoe to Massanutten which she promised me 'would not involve any mountains'. We set off, Lucy fell asleep, and I negotiated six mountain passes in 160 miles. I didn't count the night's tally of hairpin bends, but they came thick and fast. During an equally difficult drive the following night to Wisp, Maryland, the freezing fog on Backbone Pass became so frighteningly impenetrable that even though the occasional truck went trundling through I simply had to stop the car and wait for it to clear. It never did, so with teeth gritted and eyebrows knitted we drove blind for a couple of hundred yards until we suddenly found ourselves out of the clouds. How do the truck drivers do it? The journey from Liberty, Pennsylvania to Belleayre, New York was even worse and to spare ourselves a dice with death we booked ourselves a room at a roadside hotel in Newfoundland, not far from a place called The Promised Land. I like the way American resorts have themes. In New York State, our last port of call in the US, Belleayre's trails all have Indian names: among them are Wanatuska, Tongora, Utsayantha and Nimkish. Hunter Mountain, where New York skiers congregate, dedicates many of its trails to famous New York areas - Madison Square, Central Park, 7th Avenue and Broadway - as does Hunter Mountain Shiobara, its namesake in Japan. Nearby, Windham's trail names all start with W: Wolverene, Wonderfully Wicked, Why Not? and - rather insensitively - Wheelchair. New York state, as the locals point out, is very different from New York city. Larry Miller of the River Run B&amp;B in Fleischmann's, a picturesque Catskills town, escaped to the mountains from New York but goes back occasionally. 'No one locks their doors around here,' he says. 'But when I have guests from New York the first thing they want to know is can they lock their bedroom doors. 'When I go back to New York I become just like them. But it's so peaceful and crime free here you'd never believe it was the same state.' Not entirely crime free, however: a week before we arrived at fashionable Hunter Village, one guest shot another dead at the Heartbreak Hotel. After visiting towns based on the Americans' idea of what a Tyrolean village ought to look like (Leavenworth, Washington State was the best attempt, and Gatlinburg, Tennessee the tackiest) it was a joy to be back in the real thing. Kitzbuhel, even with patchy snow, was a delight, and a fair portion of Soll's Ski Welt circuit was intact. Mayrhofen had plenty of snow although much of it was verging on boilerplate. One closed run almost robbed us of a meeting with one of the Zillertal's great characters, an 82-year-old farmer called Andler. 'It is a shame this run is closed,' said Charly, our guide. 'There's a great schnapps hut down there. Shall we do it?' Lucy did not need to be asked twice. In a trice she was at the door of Andler's dilapidated hut and the toothless incumbent fixed her with a sparkling eye, planting a wet kiss on her cheek. A makeshift bed sprawled in the corner of the room where the old man made his schnapps and his cheese, and he promptly suggested that Lucy might like a rest after her drink. She declined, which did not prevent his hands wandering as we left. 'He may have been 82, but he was certainly not dead to the world,' said Lucy. 'Andler is quite an appropriate name.' There were so many people in St Anton, Lech and Zurs last week that we decided to eat late and ski hard during the lunch hour. But skiing through lunch took on a new meaning when two restaurants opposite each other on the trail down from Valluga to Stuben overflowed, blocking the piste so that we had to weave through a sea of off-duty skiers. In Lech we spotted dozens of Princess of Wales look-alikes in powder-blue suits. And then we saw the real thing, also skiing in her lunch hour. The Princess skis rather nicely these days. Such a shame she cannot be left to ski in peace. But then, she chooses high profile resorts. I have picked up plenty of great contacts in Alabama, North Carolina and Tennessee which she is welcome to. They would never spot her in a million years in Ober Gatlinburg, Tennessee.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FACTS AND FIGURES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- March statistics  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Miles skied: 369 (Total 889) Vertical feet: 402,025 (Total since January 1: 1,019,885) Vertical miles: 76 (Total: 192) Miles driven: 2,808 (Total: 12,017) Resorts visited so far: 97 (US: 48; Canada: 13; Austria: 25; Italy: 10; Germany: 1)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Resorts skied in March  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- US: Alabama: Cloudmont.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Edmundo Gonzalez Llaca] </F>   [Excerpts] In the Lacandona Jungle Declaration, the  Zapatista Army of National Liberation voiced, among other  things, its protest against "the attempts to discredit the just  cause of our struggle, accusing it of drug trafficking,  `narco'-guerrilla activity, and banditry, and using other labels  that our enemies might apply." Suspicious as I am, I recalled  the wisdom of the popular proverb: "explanation not sought,  accusation obvious." In case there were any doubts, I decided to  investigate the matter. [passage omitted]    We are talking about an austere number: 2,000 members  carrying firearms of various types and calibers, ranging from  pistols to military grenades. In its report, the Government  Secretariat stresses that the weaponry "is new for the most  part." The warring group has been training for at least a year.    Such an army, and its respective "training," requires  something more than ideology and animosity. In brief, could the  drug traffic, present in the seasoning of all stews in which  major interests are at stake, be involved in the Chiapas affair?    It would be valid to agree that this state is considered a  third-rate producing zone, because the soil on the border is  less suitable for such activity than that in the north.  Nevertheless, in view of this fact, it should also be noted  that, on the one hand, a blatant increase in poppy crops has  been observed in the border zone between Chiapas and Guatemala;  and, on the other, the controls established to reduce the drug  trafficking to the United States has prompted a search for new  routes. In other words, the fact that Chiapas is not important  as a producer does not detract from the drug traffickers'  interest in it as a preferred corridor for drug movement. We  should not forget that "El Chapo" Guzman was captured in  Guatemala.    The reporter, Jesus Sanchez, writing in EL FINANCIERO on the  subject, remarks: "The official reports show concern over the  formation of the so-called Chiapas triangle, which, by May 1993,  was being viewed from the following standpoint: It could be  concluded that, owing to conditions of extreme poverty and  serious sociopolitical conflicts, a corridor may have been  established that would create an empty zone, to be converted  into a smokescreen concealing `narco'-terrorist activities." We  can find a similar situation in Peru, with the SL [Shining Path]  group, which is offering protection for the growing and movement  of drugs.    The data proving the zone's importance as a transit point  are  interesting. During 1992, 152 aircraft presumably carrying drugs  were detected: a figure 250 percent higher than the number of  planes discovered in 1991. All of this discounts the increase in  drug drops made using short flights.    Similarly, of the total number of flights leaving South  America with illicit cargo, 43 percent have the Central American  isthmus as their destination. From there, a considerable number  reach Guatemala, and their cargo is transferred by land to  Chiapas. This is quite obvious in the trafficking of opiates,  the seizures of which last year accounted for 97 percent of the  total confiscated throughout the entire country.    Nor should we underestimate the requirements of money  laundering and the possibilities of diverting the attention of  the Army and the other authorities responsible for combating the  drug traffic, which might well be discharging this function in  other locations. This is nothing new. Perhaps the most  enlightening experience in this respect is reflected in the link  between the Colombian guerrillas and drug traffickers.    After all, behind harsh Mexico lies the Mexico of injustice  and infamy. Nevertheless, let us hope that this obvious truth  does not cause us to forget other factors which, albeit  secondary, cannot fail to disturb and aggravate the situation.  The drug traffic is, unquestionably, one of them.</p>

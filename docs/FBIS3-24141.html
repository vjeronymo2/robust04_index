			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Tatyana Akkuratova: "Glavlit Is Dead. Long Live </F> Glavlit?"]    [Text] A directive of the President of the Russian  Federation has endowed the directors of 38 ministries and  departments with the right to decide what is considered a state  secret.    Only recently, the reserves of Samotlor oil and the  building of a road beyond the Urals, the absolute figures for  oil extraction, not just as a whole for the country, but even by  individual oil fields, information on epidemics and permissible  doses of radioactive, laser and super-high-frequency  irradiation... were considered state secrets. What newspaperman  does not remember the all-powerful Ivan Ivanovich Simdyankin  from Agitprop, who alone decided whether the country should be  told that a paper machine, let us say, in Kondopoga or Solikamsk  had reached its planned capacity?    Day after day, journalists had to wage an exhausting  struggle  with Glavlit [Main Administration To Preserve State Secrets in  the Press, of the USSR Council of Ministers], trying to persuade  and entreat the censors, trying to prove to them the nonsense of  banning the publication of an apparently inoffensive fact. In  response, however, they were shown a list of pieces of  information which could in no way be reported. Things reached  the point of absurdity. For example, you must not write about  laying a highway to the electric power plant under construction  in Siberia (beyond the Urals, yet!), but just designate the  route of the access road and you can easily indicate where it  comes from and where it goes -- the censor gave an "O.K." to the  publication.    To give Glavlit credit -- it was not the one that thought up  the list of bans, it merely took pains to adhere to it. The list  of state secrets was worked out in the depths of the ministries  and departments, and approved by the USSR Council of Ministers.  Now there is no USSR Council of Ministers, Glavlit has ended up  unwanted, and the newspapers were swamped with facts that had  been kept top secret. But somehow no one heard about pernicious  journalists divulging any sort of state secrets, doing damage to  the country, during the years of this freedom. (Mirzoyanov's  convolutions, I am sure, were only of benefit to the country --  well, after all, journalists had nothing at all to do with it!)    Just what is a state secret? The federal Law "On the State  Secret" said that it is "...information protected by the state  in the sphere of its military, foreign policy, economic,  intelligence, counter-intelligence and operations-investigation  activity, the dissemination of which might be detrimental to the  safety of the Russian Federation." Judging by the President's  directive, however, this concept is now given a broader  interpretation: the safety of the state is identified with the  safety of individual departments. Most of the ministers have  been endowed with the right to qualify information as a state  secret. The heads of the ministries of Justice, Labor, Social  Security, Education and Culture and of the committees for  Cooperation with CIS States and for Nationality and Regional  Policy Affairs constituted an exception. It is completely  understandable when the ministries of Defense, Internal Affairs,  Economy, Federal Foreign Intelligence and Counter-Intelligence  services and the MID [Ministry of Foreign Affairs] possess the  right to make information secret. But what sort of state secrets  do the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Agriculture, the  State Committee for Higher Education and the Ministry of  Environmental Protection and Natural Resources guard? Or will  they again conceal from us data on harvests, catastrophes and  natural disasters, ecology and demography? We will draw them  from broadcasts of the BBC or Radio Freedom. In a word, it is a  question of whether society can obtain reliable, objective  information -- the right to the freedom to seek, obtain and  transmit this information was declared by our Constitution.    It must be said that even before the president's directive  it  was quite difficult to obtain information at the ministries --  the press-services, created, one would think, to help the  writing brethren, protected them reliably. These services,  however, turned into an impenetrable wall, shutting the  officials away from the journalists. The ministerial bureaucrats  have now obtained a super-reliable means: consider some sort of  data a state secret -- and they are tightly closed to the press.  Again the officials will decide what we can know and what we  cannot know. Does the departmental right to make information  secret not contradict the presidential Edict, which speaks of  indispensable informational openness concerning the actions of  the authorities? It would seem that the list of state secrets  should still pass a qualifying examination by expert scientists,  lawyers and journalists.    One more thing. Who will see to it that journalists still do  not publish facts with the stamp of "top secret"? Will Glavlit  rise again?</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Chetumal, 17 May (NOTIMEX) -- Francisco Chop Chomo,  representative of the Permanent Commissions for Refugees,  indicated that some 220 Guatemalan refugees, who had settled in  the southeastern Mexican State of Quintana Roo, today returned  to Guatemala by plane.    Chop Chomo noted that the first Hercules plane flight  departed at 1210 local time, while the second flight departed at  1600 local time en route to Playa Grande, Guatemala. Chop Chomo  added that the third flight scheduled for 17 May was canceled  due to mechanical failure. Another 360 Guatemalans are expected  to return 18 May on two more flights, one at 0900 and another at  1300 local time.    Chop Chomo said that representatives of the UN High  Commissioner for Refugees [UNHCR] and the Mexican Commission for  Aid to Refugees accompanied the refugees to the airport of Playa  Grande. He indicated that the Guatemalan Army refuses to allow  international observers to accompany the refugees until they  reach Pueblo Nuevo, Mayalan, and Santa Maria Tzeja, where  returning refugees will settle.    According to UNHCR reports, 1,717 Guatemalan refugees will  return voluntarily to their country by plane from 13 to 19 May.  This operation constitutes the fourth collective return since 20  January 1993 when some 2,500 Guatemalans returned to their  country and the first returned by plane. Some 43,000 Guatemalan  refugees have lived in camps in southeastern Mexico since the  early 1980's, when they began fleeing from attacks by the  Guatemalan Army.    Meanwhile, Gilberto Ocana Mendez, prison director in Chiapas  State, announced that four of the 42 inmates, who began a hunger  strike on 16 May, suspended the action following the promise  that they would be returned to their country.    Guatemalan nationals Alfonso Gabriel Mendez, Juan Lopez  Ramirez, Nicolas Vasquez Gabriel, and Marcos Prez Sanchez were  arrested after being charged with violating the General  Population Law of Mexico. Guatemalan Consul in Chetumal Jose  Ignacio Salan Casados visited the inmates to tell them that  within hours they would be returning to Colotenango, a community  in the northwestern Guatemalan Department of Huehuetenango.</p>

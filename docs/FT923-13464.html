			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Mexican ruling party heads for state poll defeat MEXICO'S centre-right National Action party (PAN) is set to win the governorship of Chihuahua state, only the second time that the ruling Institutional Revolutionary party (PRI) has lost a gubernatorial election in its 63-year history. Mr Francisco Barrio, the PAN candidate, declared victory early yesterday morning, with an estimated 54 per cent of the vote, based on his party's unofficial count. The PRI had 41 per cent of the vote, and appeared ready to concede. However, the PRI appeared to be leading in the weekend's other governorship election, in the state of Michoacan, where the main opposition was the left-of-centre Party of Democratic Revolution (PRD). The PRI estimated that it was ahead by about two to one after counting 70 per cent of the votes. In contrast the PRD estimated that it was narrowly ahead after counting votes at around 20 per cent of the polling booths. An exit poll put the PRI well ahead. The contending claims could prepare the way for a tense post-electoral period. The PRD is planning to hold a victory rally today, which may turn into a demonstration against the government party. The PRI hopes that a defeat for the PRD in the stronghold of its president, Mr Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, would make it difficult for it to mount an effective challenge in the 1994 presidential elections. For this reason the PRI mounted one of the most expensive and sophisticated campaigns in its history, spending Dollars 33m (Pounds 17.2m) in the state, according to observer groups' estimates. The voting was quiet and relatively trouble-free in Chihuahua, partly because the government and PAN worked together to ensure a peaceful process. The PAN's victory reflects its support in northern, better-off and relatively industrialised states. It won its first governorship in 1989 in Baja California, another border state. In a 1991 election in the state of Guanajuato, the PRI candidate resigned and admitted charges of vote fraud, after which President Carlos Salinas named an interim governor from the ranks of the PAN. The PAN's victory in Chihuahua may actually benefit Mr Salinas's government. It will be used as evidence of the PRI's commitment to greater democracy, and further strengthen the hand of the conciliatory faction in the pro-business PAN, thereby widening the gulf between it and the more hard-line PRD. In Michoacan the election was much calmer than the municipal elections in 1989, but Mr Ricardo Pascoe, the PRD spokesman, claimed the process was 'fraught with irregularities - some of them very serious'. He claimed that multiple voting was widespread, electoral rolls were changed at the last minute, and voting urns were stolen.</p>

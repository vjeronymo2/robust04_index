			<p>BFN     [Text] Russia's trade turnover with countries outside  former Soviet territory from January to April amounted to 18.1  billion dollars, having gone down by 5.2 pct, according to the  State Committee for Statistics.    While exports rose by 6 pct, imports fell by 23 pct, the  positive balance consequently increasing to 6.9 billion dlrs, as  compared to 4.5 billion a year ago, the committee said.    Exports of crude oil reached 26.8 million tonnes, or 9 pct  up  on the same period last year, those of natural gas 38 billion  cubic meters (15 pct up), those of oil products 9.5 million  tonnes (14 pct up), those of mineral fertilizers 3.6 million  tonnes (11 pct up), and those of pig iron 828,000 tonnes (61 pct  up). At the same time exports of machinery and equipment  dropped by 23 pct.    In the first four months of 1994, Russia exported to  countries in the Commonwealth of Independent States 8.7 million  tonnes of oil, or half as much as in the same period in 1993,  and 26.3 billion cubic meters of natural gas, or 3 percent down.    Russia imported from January to April 417,000 tonnes of  grain, or one-tenth of the amount of the first four months of  last year, half as much meat, and two-thirds as much white  sugar, though imports of meat, poultry, tea, butter and  furniture went up, the committee said.</p>

			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / Historic city centre faces flood: Chichester prepares for the worst as further rain is forecast They were preparing for the worst in Chichester's elegant County Hall last night as the River Lavant threatened to burst its banks and flood the historic centre of the West Sussex city. There was the distinct air of a war bunker in three basement rooms as county council officials and exhausted firefighters awaited the arrival of the main bulk of a 150-strong force of army engineers, junior government minister Mr Charles Wardle and 150,000 sandbags. Scientists and officials from the National Rivers Authority fought for wall space for their charts showing river levels and river flows. Chichester, the county town of West Sussex with a population of 20,000, is an unlikely place to be in what resembles a state of siege, with its beautiful cathedral, half-timbered coffee shops and pleasant Georgian architecture. The River Lavant has never caused much trouble in the past. Now, the city's eastern fringes have been flooded, though not seriously so. But the fear is that further rain before the weekend could cause the breakdown of a culvert running beneath the city centre and bring flooding in the heart of the city. And the weather forecast is for more rain tomorrow. Efforts are going on round the clock to shore up the river at the eastern fringes and late yesterday 85 members of the fire brigade were hard at work there, using sandbags and mud. Parts of the town centre have been ripped up to make way for pipes which are decanting 4.5m gallons of water a day from the Lavant into the sea at Fishbourne Bay, three miles to the south of the city. Several Green Goddesses - venerable army fire engines - are being used as part of this operation. However, officials say this may not be enough. One of the first things Lt Col Robbie Burns, in command of the contingent from the 36th Engineers Regiment, will have to decide is whether to build temporary bridges where sections of the A27 and the A259 are under water to enable traffic to get through. The engineers will also look at ways of drawing off more water from the Lavant. Ageing culvert takes the strain, Page 8</p>

			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / Management: Making more of research How does the UK get better value out of its burgeoning management research industry? The country now has more than 100 business schools - roughly half of whose 4,100 academics are thought to be active in research - yet it is widely agreed that their quality and impact is variable. Such a feeling prompted the Economic &amp; Social Research Council in late 1992 to look at the issues under the aegis of a commission chaired by Professor George Bain of the London Business School. Many of the recommendations of its final report* published this month are concerned with sustaining and improving the quality of research. But there is also strong emphasis on improving its relevance to users - managers, entrepreneurs, policymakers, consultants and trade unions, for example - notably in the proposal for an independent management research forum to generate debate about priorities. The forum as outlined could have other roles, including helping to increase the exchange of knowledge between academic and user communities and helping to develop research partnerships. Researchers are also urged to support their proposals to the ESRC with 'user strategies'. The report argues for increased public funding but says this should be matched with co-funding from institutions and business. It states that 'good management research develops from a synergy between the needs of practising managers and the inquisitive, analytical, explanatory approach adopted by academics. And the best management research lifts itself above immediate problem-solving to provide perspectives that contribute towards a cumulative understanding of management and the environments in which it operates'. *The Research Evaluation Division, Economic &amp; Social Research Council.

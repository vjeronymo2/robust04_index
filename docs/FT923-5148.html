			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Unsettled UK summer yields bitter fruit - Apples and potatoes have fared better than grain, but prices are disappointingly low / Farmer's Viewpoint THE UNSETTLED summer of 1992 may not be proving ideal for cereals but it looks like turning out rather well for some other crops like potatoes and apples. I should stress, however, that I am referring to supply rather than prices or profitability. For, as ever, a modest excess of perishable commodities is leading to market collapse. In theory, cereals are not all that perishable. They should be gathered into barns, dried if necessary and stored safely until required for human or animal food. For the last few years that is what has happened. This year, however, after one of the earliest-ever starts to the UK cereal harvest, in ideal conditions, it suddenly all went dreadfully wrong. In mid-August, the main harvest month, the weather deteriorated. A series of long downpours, interspersed with heavy showers, knocked crops of wheat which had previously looked potentially reasonable, for both yield and quality, flat to the ground. Many of those crops are still out in the fields, especially in the northern half of England and in Scotland. It is simply not possible to work a combine harvester in crops that are flat and saturated, however efficient your dryer. And now the grains are growing in the ears. Farmers will, of course, press on with the harvest whenever the weather allows, but they know already that much of what they will bring into their barns will not even be good pig feed and will therefore be worth very little. But weather conditions have been excellent for other crops; confirmation, if it were needed, that farmers are wise if they adopt diverse cropping systems. Apples, for instance, have looked promising since blossom time. There was little frost to damage the fruit set and the warm summer followed by the recent rain has matured the fruit two to three weeks earlier than usual. Even the strong winds over the bank holiday weekend will have done little damage to a crop which these days is mainly grown behind high wind-breaking hedges and on trees trained, for ease of picking, to grow to no more than head height. So, this week fruit growers across the country expect to start picking their main variety - traditional Coxes. Reports suggest that it will be an excellent crop for quantity and quality almost everywhere. But prices seem set to be disappointing. The estimated size of the UK crop is, in fact, only a little above average. But there are other factors that will help keep wholesale prices low. The first is a large quantity of southern hemisphere fruit, picked last winter, shipped to this country and since held in UK cold stores. Fruit traders describe the apples as 'tired' but the fact remains that they have to be disposed of at almost any price and in the meantime overhang the market for freshly picked home grown apples. The second reason for UK growers concern is the massive apple crops grown in Europe. Conditions have been ideal across the continent and current estimates that the total EC metric tonnage for picking this year is around 10m tonnes. Last year Europe's apple growers produced a mere 5.7m tonnes and the long term average is nearer 8m tonnes. All of which adds up to a depressed English apple market with best fruit wholesaling at present at not much more than 20p a lb, packed and graded. When the cost of packing, transport and market commission can come to 15p a lb it is clear that there is an inadequate margin left to cover all the costs of growing and picking, let alone leave a profit for the orchard owner. Incidentally, by way of research for this article, at the weekend I bought a fraction over a lb of fresh English gala apples in a well known multiple store. . . they cost me 99p. Not a bad mark-up] It is nice to know the supermarkets are not suffering like their suppliers. In any event it seems probable that the European Community's scheme to stabilise the apple market in times of glut will be activated again this year. It is triggered at the request of marketing co-operatives when prices fall to unprofitable levels. The EC authorities then intervene in the market to take some of the surplus off the market. The fruit they buy is either buried or fed to livestock. Use of the scheme in the UK is usually limited to taking a tiny percentage of surplus Bramley cooking apples off the market. But in France and Italy, where much bigger tonnages of varieties such as golden delicious can be grown, the intervention price itself can be profitable. And there is a great deal of suspicion in the UK that some of the 'destroyed' fruit ends up in apple pies. The UK Potato Marketing Board announced its intervention buying programme for maincrop produce last week. This too follows forecast of a massive surplus and the collapse of the market price to Pounds 38 a tonne. The board's buying-in price is Pounds 33 a tonne and the purchased tonnages will be offered to livestock farmers for feed. As with apples, prices have collapsed because of a perceived surplus. Some so-called experts have estimated that the UK may have grown up to a 1m-tonne surplus this year (against average production of about 6m tonnes). But others point to the high incidence of diseases such as blight, black leg and powdery scab, which may mean that the tubers will rot in store. It is also possible, say the moderates, that these estimates of very big crops have failed to account for the fact that irrigation as had little effect this year. Meanwhile potato growers are angry that while they are receiving as little as 2p for a lb for potatoes, supermarkets are still charging consumers up to 20p a lb. Doubtless the buyers for the multiples feel they are quite safe in screwing down prices paid to UK farmers as they know there are plenty of alternative supplies just across the English Channel. There are big potato crops in The Netherlands, Belgium, France and Germany and between them these countries have planted an extra 60,000 hectares (150,000 acres) this year. Moreover the price of potatoes in Belgium, for instance, where there is the largest surplus, has fallen to only about Pounds 20 per tonne. No European farmer can grow potatoes profitably at that sort of price. Indeed, it seems probable that many UK growers who have to rely on the PMB's fall-back price will also lose a lot of money this year. After all it costs between Pounds 2,000 and Pounds 3,000 a hectare (Pounds 800-1,200 an acre), depending on the system used, to grow potatoes, and it takes an incredibly good crop to yield more than 62.5 tonnes a hectare (25 tonnes an acre). But the UK does, at least, control the acreage of potatoes grown through a quota scheme operated by the PMB and this limits any surplus, even in a good year. Furthermore, buying programmes to support and stabilise markets, like that announced last week, are funded by growers themselves. For all its faults, the system does work and is the envy of some continental growers. It is reported, however, that Mr John Gummer, the Minister of Agriculture, is seeking to abolish these statutory powers. Moreover, he is planning this just months after he agreed with the other agricultural ministers of the EC to introduce volume control for other farm commodities. Does he seek to bring about the same kind of chaos in UK potato markets as exists on the continent? Could this possibly be in the best interests of either producers or consumers of potatoes? How can it possibly be consistent to try to control the production of one batch of food crops while deliberately encouraging over-production of another? I think we should be told.</p>

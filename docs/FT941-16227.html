			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / International Company News: Michelin to launch FFr3.5bn convertible bond Michelin, the French tyre manufacturer, yesterday announced it would launch a FFr3.5bn convertible bond issue in a move to reduce its debt, diversify its sources of finance and reinforce its financial structure. The company, which had first-half losses of FFr3.19bn (Dollars 540m) last year after provisions for restructuring, has debts of about FFr30bn. Michelin said last night, however, that it was confident of recovery in the international tyre market. It said the recovery in the North American market should continue over the next few years and that the sharp price competition which started at the beginning of last year had stabilised. In Europe, which suffered a particularly sharp contraction in 1993, Michelin said there were signs that the decline in sales had ended. Some markets, such as the UK, had seen the start of recovery, according to the company. The group said its restructuring plan, which involves the loss of 2,950 jobs and a reduction of operating costs by FFr3.5bn by the middle of next year, was on schedule. Provisions for the costs of the restructuring plan, which total about FFr2.6bn, were taken in the first half of last year. Industry analysts in Paris said that the convertible bond issue was timed to tap the buoyant Paris stock market. Yesterday, the CAC-40 index of leading shares reached another record, rising 0.4 per cent to close at 2,317. Under the terms of the issue, to be launched on January 12, bonds will be priced at FFr255. On Monday, before news of the issue, Michelin shares rose FFr3 to a 12-month high of FFr229.1. The bonds, which can be exchanged on the basis of one for one share from February 2, will mature on January 1, 2001. They will carry an interest rate of 2.5 per cent, or FFr6.38, payable on January 1 each year. Michelin said the yield would be 5.03 per cent if the bonds are not converted. On maturity, they will be repaid at FFr307 each, or 120.39 per cent of the issue price. Existing shareholders will be given a priority entitlement of one bond for every 15 shares between January 12 and January 21 inclusive.</p>

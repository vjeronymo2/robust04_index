			<p><P> June 15, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> State Sen. Ernest L. Passailaigue said Wednesday that he will introduce a  resolution in the South Carolina General Assembly next week, asking the  commissioner of baseball to clear the name of Shoeless Joe Jackson.  </P> <P> Jackson and seven other Chicago White Sox players were accused of throwing the  1919 World Series to Cincinnati in return for money from gamblers in what  became known as the "Black Sox scandal." A jury found the players not guilty of  attempting to "defraud the public," but Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis  banned them from baseball for life.  </P> <P> The ban has kept Jackson from being considered for the Hall of Fame -- an honor  many think he deserves given his .356 average is the third highest on record.  </P> <P> Passailaigue said his interest in Jackson was piqued recently by an article in  a Charleston (S.C.) newspaper and the movie "Field of Dreams," which portrays  Jackson as a resurrected hero.  </P></p>

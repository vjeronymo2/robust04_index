			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Ciskei, which has decided to contest South Africa's  first all-race election, has been excluded from the country's  decisionmaking bodies after failing to apply in time for  membership of the Transitional Executive Council [TEC]. The TEC  said in a statement in Pretoria that Ciskei had been given until  midday on 28 January to apply for membership of the body but had  failed to do so. Earlier, Ciskei withdrew from the Freedom  Alliance, which remains opposed to the 26-28 April election.  Ciskei's failure to apply for membership of the TEC means that  its troops will have to withdraw from the multiparty National  Peacekeeping Force, which began training near Bloemfontein on 24  January.</p>

			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / International Company News: Schering sets sales deadline SCHERING, the Berlin-based pharmaceuticals and chemicals group, said it expected to find a partner for its poorly-performing industrial and organic chemicals businesses or sell them by the end of July. Mr Georg Obermeier, finance director of VIAG, the German industrial group, was quoted as saying his company wanted to buy the two Schering operations, but a Schering spokeswoman said no decision had been reached. 'We are still talking with several candidates but have not yet chosen one with whom we would conclude a letter of intent,' Ms Mechthild Weber explained. Earlier, Schering shareholders at the annual meeting were told that it was also seeking a partner or buyer for its electroplating sector by the end of next month. Mr Giuseppe Vita, the chairman, said sales were expected to rise by 5 per cent but that earnings would not reach the record level of last year when they rose 6 per cent to DM274m. Despite flourishing pharmaceuticals sales, up 15 per cent in the first four months of this year, turnover in the important plant protection sector, which makes up 24 per cent of turnover, plunged 13 per cent in the same period. The fall was largely accounted for by weakness in Western European markets. Other 'risks and burdens' include disproportionally heavy investments in research and development as well as expansion of marketing. Personnel costs, too, had risen sharply and could not be compensated for by higher prices. He said the EC's cuts in subsidies for grain and reductions in farmland were further handicaps. Mr Vita, the only Italian national to head a large German company, said the pharmaceuticals sector, making up 56.4 per cent of total group sales, would be reorganised, with even greater emphasis placed on it in the future. The company's presence in the US and Japanese markets is to be expanded.</p>

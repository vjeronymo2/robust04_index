			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sulayman 'Abd-al-'Azim] </F>   [Text] In a sudden development within the Liberal Party,  Wahid Ghazi, chief editor of the weekly edition of AL-AHRAR last  Saturday [18 June] tendered his resignation to Liberal Party  leader Mustafa Kamil Murad. Murad's secretary refused to  acknowledge official receipt of the resignation, forcing Ghazi  to send it with a bailiff on Sunday morning to the party, but  party officials also refused to acknowledge receipt of the  resignation.    Having failed to get either the party leader, or the party  itself, to recognize his resignation, Ghazi again asked a  bailiff from the Public Prosecution Office to hand the  resignation either to the party leader or the party's  secretariat.    AL-MUSAWWAR has learned that Ghazi's resignation is due to  his disapproval of the party's recent shift from liberal to  Nasirist and fundamentalist policies. Ghazi says that the  change is unprecedented and contradicts the party's program.    Party leader Murad this week ordered the discontinuation of  the weekly edition of AL-AHRAR, the newspaper for which Ghazi  served as chief editor for the past 14 years.    Murad also appointed Ghazi as chief editor of the daily [as  published] newspaper AL-USRAH AL-'ARABIYAH. It is worth noting  that AL-USRAH AL-'ARABIYAH basically functions as a vehicle for  legal announcements.    Speaking to AL-MUSAWWAR, Ghazi said: We respect the  Nasirists and anyone whose political views vary with ours. But  we are against sudden changes of the party's program and  orientation about which party members are not consulted. It is  unacceptable for one person to make party members alter their  principles and doctrine against their will. Such actions  violate the law of political parties.</p>

			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Election 1992: Evidence remains of them-and-us attitude - Around the country on the critical issues that have emerged SOUTH-EA In this region the sand of recession has clogged up the electoral machinery, David Marsh writes. And the many who feel they have lost out under the Tories are in a mood to exact vengeance. Even if the Tories confound the pollsters and scrape home, the policies of any future Major government would be much less geared to promoting red-blooded capitalism. In southern England, much has not changed. The division into 'them and us' is still ever-present, emphasised by the separate appeal of the two main parties to different thicknesses of wallet. For all the recent modernisation of the Labour party, its candidates - who are on the whole more human, more humble and more humorous than the dozen Tory incumbents I have interviewed - still see that old devil 'market forces' as their chief enemy. As for the signs of change that appeared during the 1980s, some are pleasant, but many are disagreeable. The preponderance of expensive fashion shops in town centres seems proportional to the number of shabbily dressed people outside - some, with vague looks on their faces, on their way to scour rubbish bins. The Conservatives stand accused of neglecting the nation and feather-bedding themselves. They point to what they say will happen if Labour wins: not only will the dead go unburied again, but their mortgage bills will go up too. The south of England has long regarded itself as a secure province in the heart of a victorious country. If the tide turns, and the opposing armies advance, the province could wake tomorrow to find itself on the front line. LONDON: Labour's London campaign team thought it would be tilting at giants, but they turned out to be only windmills, David Owen writes. Tory tacticians have not come up with anything remotely comparable to Labour's Big London Idea: a strategic government for the capital. Also, this time Labour's outspoken figures - from Mr Ken Livingstone in Brent East to Mr Bernie Grant in Tottenham - have been models of obedience. 'It is sheer discipline that has been doing it,' says Mr Tony Banks, the candidate for Newham North West, slipping into his best hair shirt. Bar the odd fulmination from Mr Michael Heseltine, Central Office has made little attempt to communicate the message to voters in the capital's marginals. Candidates and constituents have been left to work it out for themselves. This inertia has bred resentment at grassroots level. One Conservative candidate in a key London seat describes those running the party's campaign as 'absolute nincompoops'. Winning the campaign will not necessarily win Labour the 21 London seats it needs to secure an overall majority. For once, though, Labour has made every effort to smooth its own path. Polls suggest that 16 or 17 gains may be within its grasp. MIDLANDS: Three weeks ago, Mr Neil Kinnock walked into Birmingham's International Convention Centre in a rally to launch the Labour campaign, Richard Donkin writes. But all the subsequent rallies and tours by the party leaders, played out for the media have borne little resemblance to the campaign on the ground in the west Midlands. The candidates have at times felt remote from their leaderships and have seen a different Britain from that which comes across from the invited audiences and radio phone-ins. Arguments about tax did not count for much in the west Midlands, where most wage earners are below the levels needed to trigger Labour's higher rates. One in six manufacturing employees in the region rely on the motor industry for their jobs, and news that car sales fell in March did nothing to lift morale in Conservative party offices in the marginal seats. While they were solidly behind Mr Major, one could not escape a feeling that they were suffering withdrawal symptoms from the euphoria of the Thatcher years. The fact that opinion has apparently moved little during the campaign in the Midlands has not surprised veteran party agents, who rarely worry about the issues. They wear a heavy cloak of cynicism woven from past experience. Sir Richard Knowles, Labour's agent for Birmingham Sparkbrook, said: 'The best a candidate could do would be to fall ill for the duration of the campaign, in which case he might earn about 500 extra sympathy votes. If his wife had a baby just before the poll, it would be even better.' NORTH-WE In this part of England the country is perceived as being run from the south-east, for the south-east, Roger Matthews writes. Party leaders have reinforced that impression as they have increasingly relied on the electronic media to get their message across. Local candidates make great play where they can of their affinity with the region - people in Lancashire have been heard to say 'the lad's not from round here so he can't understand cotton' as a definitive reason for voters opposing a candidate. In the north-west, where people remain refreshingly direct and do not mind discussing how they vote, there has been all too little debate at constituency level. If it were not for the churches and other religious organisations, there would be almost no set-piece public meetings involving all the candidates. Public exposure, which goes beyond shaking hands in shopping malls and knocking on doors, might also contribute to an improvement in the selection and preparedness of candidates. Emotions have been strongly stirred among two sections of voters: those who feel betrayed by the Conservative party and those who suffer an almost allergic reaction to Mr Neil Kinnock. Labour, whatever its debt to Mr Kinnock for bringing the party back to the electorate, has benefited far more from the performance of Mr John Smith. SCOTLAND: The final pre-election polls in Scotland have not been encouraging for the Scottish National party, James Buxton and Bethan Hutton write. Three polls yesterday showed the party's support declining by about 2 points, to between 24 and 25 per cent. While Labour and the Conservatives publicly took comfort from the apparent decline in the nationalists' fortunes and from a decline in support for independence, opinion polls have in the past understated the SNP's support. In any case, the nationalists' position in the polls is still nearly double what it was in 1987. In addition, the outcome in many key Scottish constituencies, where four parties are contesting marginal seats under the first-past-the-post system, is virtually impossible to forecast. A poll for The Scotsman newspaper, while showing Labour and the Conservatives unchanged on 41 per cent and 22 per cent respectively, showed a 2-point rise in backing for the Liberal Democrats, to 11 per cent. Although that is well below their average of 18 per cent in national surveys, much of their support is entrenched in rural constituencies where individual MPs have strong personal votes.</p>

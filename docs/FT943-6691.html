			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Baldwin cuts seasonal deficit Baldwin, which has interests in tour operating, restaurants, printing and property, reduced its pre-tax losses from Pounds 2.25m to Pounds 2.17m in the half year ended April 30. Mr David Landau, chairman, said that as in previous years the deficit was a direct result of the group's accounting policy and the seasonality of the tour operating division. Group turnover advanced to Pounds 11.4m (Pounds 8.41m) reflecting both organic growth and a full six month trading from the restaurant division, he said. During the second half the restaurant side should benefit from the refurbishment programme, the elimination of 10 lossmaking units and the growing popularity of the Simpsons restaurants. He said all indications were that the group was heading for a record performance in the current period. Profits were Pounds 2.83m pre-tax for the year to last October. Despite losses per share of 7.67p (7.93p) the interim dividend is held at 1.6p.</p>

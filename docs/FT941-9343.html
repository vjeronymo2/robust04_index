			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / International Company News: CanPac plans to raise CDollars 500m Canadian Pacific, the transport, resources, hotel and property group, is raising CDollars 500m (USDollars 373.1m) with a new equity issue. Net proceeds of CDollars 484m after costs will be used to repay debt and for investment in its principal businesses. 'The new equity will raise flexibility and put our balance sheet on a sound footing, just as prospects are improving with economic recovery,' Mr William Stinson, chairman, said. CP stock hit a 52-week high of CDollars 24.25 in the market last week after the company reported a stronger than expected turnround in 1993. The group has been restructured over two years of recession, and mining and forest products interests have been sold. The writedowns required have already been made. Before unusual items, fourth quarter net profit from continuing operations was 34 cents a share, nearly twice what many analysts had expected. For all 1993, profit equalled 76 cents a share, against 34 cents in 1992. Freight rail operations led the fourth-quarter upturn with a 15 per cent gain in volume, while energy and most other businesses did better for the full year. Analysts expect a weaker first quarter this year, but Mr John Johnson, of Richardson Greenshields Canada, says 'CP's earnings are at a full recovery setting'. CP will file a short-form prospectus for the issue of 22m common shares at CDollars 22.75 a share tomorrow. The offer closes March 10 and is not being registered in the US. RBC Dominion Securities leads the underwriting group.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;1927.58  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Closing the transaction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The closing agent will cooperate with the approval official, the borrower and the seller, and other necessary parties to arrange the time and place of closing. The closing agent will make sure that FmHA obtains a valid mortgage lien on the property of the priority required by FmHA, subject only to any defects and exceptions approved by the approval official or State Director. The ``Date of Closing'' will be considered to be the date that the note and mortgage are signed, and the loan closing process takes place.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Disbursement of loan funds.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> When the closing agent indicates that the conditions necessary to close the loan have been met, loan funds will be forwarded to the closing agent. Loan funds will not be disbursed prior to filing of the mortgage for record; however, when necessary, loan funds may be placed in escrow before the mortgage is filed for record and disbursed after it is filed. No development funds will be kept in escrow by the closing agent after loan closing. Loan funds for the payment of a lien may be disbursed only upon receipt of a discharge, satisfaction, or release (or assignment where necessary to protect the interests of FmHA).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Title examination and liens or claims against borrowers.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The closing agent will examine the title for liens against the property and claims against the borrower from the terminal date of the preliminary title examination up to and including the time of recording the current mortgage. If there are no entries of record during the period, except the documents required in connection with title clearance and any partial release(s) or subordination(s) previously approved by FmHA, the transaction may be closed. If there are other entries of record during this period, the transaction will not be closed until these entries have been cleared of record or administratively approved. The closing agent will advise the approval official of the nature of such intervening instruments and the effect they may have on obtaining a valid mortgage of the priority required or the title insurance policy to be issued.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Taxes and assessments.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The closing agent will determine if all taxes and assessments against the property which are due and payable are paid at or before the time of loan closing. If the seller and the borrower have agreed to prorate any taxes or assessment which are not yet due and payable for the year in which the closing of the transaction takes place, the seller's proportionate share of the taxes and assessments will be deducted from the proceeds to be paid to seller at closing and will be credited to the amount required to be paid by borrower at closing. Certificates or receipts should be produced from the taxing authorities to show that taxes or assessments which are due and payable have been paid and, if possible, the certificates or receipts, or copies, will be kept in the borrower's County Office or District Office case file. Appropriate prorations as agreed upon between the borrower and seller may also be made for taxes paid by the seller which are applicable to a period after the closing date, common area maintenance fees, prepaid rentals, insurance (unless the borrower is to obtain a new policy of insurance) and growing crops.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Affidavit regarding work of improvement_(1) Execution by borrower.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The closing agent will require that a Form FmHA 1927&hyph;5, ``Affidavit Regarding Work of Improvement,'' be completed and executed (including acknowledgment) when a loan is being made to a borrower who already owns the real estate to be mortgaged. This affidavit will be executed by the borrower at closing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Execution by seller.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The closing agent will require that Form FmHA 1927&hyph;5 be completed and executed (including acknowledgment) by the seller when the FmHA is making a loan to a borrower to enable the borrower to acquire the property (including transfers). This affidavit will be executed by the seller at closing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Legal insufficiency of affidavit form.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If Form FmHA 1927&hyph;5 is not legally sufficient in a particular state, a state form approved by OGC will be used. A similar form that may be required by a title insurance company may be substituted for Form FmHA 1927&hyph;5.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Recording.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The affidavit will not be recorded unless the closing agent deems it necessary and state law permits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Delay in closing.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The loan will not be closed if, at the loan closing, the seller (in a sale transaction) or the borrower (in a nonpurchase money loan situation) indicates that construction, repair or remodeling has been commenced or completed on the property, or related materials or services have been delivered to or performed on the property within the time limit specified in the affidavit, unless a state supplement otherwise provides. The closing agent will notify the approval official, who will determine if the work of improvement will result in a lien prior to the FmHA lien. The State Director will, with the advice and concurrence of OGC, provide in a state supplement the period of time to be used in completing the affidavit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Completion of closing documents.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The closing agent will determine that deeds, promissory notes, mortgages, releases, and other curative instruments are completed in accordance with the FMI (sealed and witnessed if required by state law) and, if necessary, acknowledged and filed for record at the proper time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Assignment of future income.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If Form FmHA 443&hyph;16, ``Assignment of Income from Real Estate Security,'' is required in a particular case, the approval official will prepare the form and have it available for execution by the borrower when the transaction closes. The closing agent will see that the form is properly completed, executed (sealed and witnessed if required by state law), and acknowledged by the borrower.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Return of loan documents to approval official after loan closing.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Within one day after loan closing, the closing agent will return completed and executed copies of Form FmHA 1927&hyph;15, the promissory note, all other documents required for loan closing (except the mortgage), and the final title opinion or policy of title insurance to the approval official. If the recorded mortgage is customarily returned to the borrower or closing agent after recording, then it must be forwarded to the approval official immediately.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

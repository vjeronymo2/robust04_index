			<p><P> July 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SACRAMENTO;  </P> <P> STATE PENSION FUND WANTS A ROLE ON BANKRUPTCY COMMITTEES  </P> <P> The California Public Employees Retirement System has launched a drive to  change federal law so that it and other government entities can serve on  committees overseeing bankruptcy reorganization plans.  </P> <P> CalPERS is owed $25 million by Drexel Burnham Lambert Group, which filed  earlier this year for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.  </P> <P> After a frustrating legal scramble to recover its losses, the nation's largest  public pension fund wants Congress to amend rules that prevent such "government  units" from serving on Chapter 11 creditor committees. These oversight  committees can have considerable sway in shaping bankruptcy reorganization  plans and in trying to recover losses to creditors quickly.  </P> <P> The $56-billion pension fund was recently denied a seat on the creditor  committee that was formed to restructure Drexel. The parent firm of the  high-flying brokerage filed for bankruptcy after the junk market collapsed and  small investors retreated from the stock market. The parent's assets exceeded  liabilities by more than $700 million.  </P> <P> Institutions and individuals quickly lined up to rescue their investments.  CalPERS, which is Drexel's fifth-largest creditor, got in line too.  </P> <P> CalPERS had loaned Drexel $25 million secured by junk bonds. In 1986, when  CalPERS made the investment, the rate on the bonds was 2% higher than other  fixed-income investments that CalPERS held in its portfolio.  </P> <P> "It was considered attractive for its quality," said DeWitt Bowman, CalPERS'  chief investment officer told the state Senate Committee on Public Employment  and Retirement.  </P> <P> Although CalPERS can monitor the Drexel bankruptcy proceedings, it can't vote  on matters related to the restructuring. In federal court in New York, Judge  Howard Buschman was sympathetic to CalPERS' appeal to serve on the committee,  but federal law prohibits it.  </P> <P> Only "persons" with creditor claims against the bankrupt firm are entitled to  serve on the committee, according to the bankruptcy code. "Persons" is defined  as "individual, partnership and corporation but does not include governmental  units."  </P> <P> In 1984, Congress amended the definition so that a limited number of federal  agencies, such as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Small Business  Administration, could serve on creditor committees. But public pension funds  are still excluded, and a number of court cases challenging the law have failed  to overturn it.  </P> <P> No federal legislation has been introduced to change the law, but CalPERS is  trying to persuade the California Legislature to carry its message to  Washington. State lawmakers are considering a resolution that would urge  Congress to move on legislation to permit agencies such as CalPERS to serve on  bankruptcy committees.  </P> <P> Representing more than 600,000 California public employees, CalPERS first  became interested in changing the federal rules during litigation three years  ago between Texaco and Pennzoil. In a takeover battle between the two oil  giants, Texaco filed for bankruptcy and CalPERS was denied voting status on the  creditor committee even though it was a major stockholder in Texaco.  </P> <P> A recent legislative hearing on the resolution gave state legislators an  opportunity to inquire about the soundness of CalPERS' investing in junk bonds.  </P> <P> The legislative committee learned that of the $11.3 billion CalPERS has  invested in corporate and U.S. Treasury bonds, less than 16%, or $1.9 billion,  is secured by company assets or by government guarantees. Moreover, CalPERS has  a total of $500 million invested in high-yield junk bonds.  </P> <P> Unlike other states, the California Legislature has placed virtually no  restrictions on CalPERS' investment decisions. Other than a requirement that  part of its portfolio go into home mortgages, CalPERS can make "any investment  authorized by law."  </P> <P> Measured by rate of return, that flexibility has paid off.  </P> <P> In the past five years, CalPERS has earned an average annual yield of 18.2%.  Despite the Drexel fiasco, junk bonds yielded the pension fund a 30% annual  rate of return since 1986.  </P> <P> Bowman won't even second-guess the decision to get involved with Drexel. "We  believe it was an appropriate investment," he said. "If fixed-income  investments are properly diversified, the return can far exceed the risk of an  occasional default."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sales Tax Probe Targets Swap-Meet Vendors  </P> <P> With tax revenue in short supply this summer, the state Board of Equalization  is moving outdoors to ferret out firms that avoid charging sales taxes. The  board has launched an investigation of swap-meet vendors who ignore state  requirements to obtain a Board of Equalization seller's permit and collect  sales taxes.  </P> <P> Prompted by legislation approved last year, investigators "will visit swap  meets throughout California to verify that regular sellers have permits before  selling merchandise," said board spokeswoman Delena Bratton.  </P> <P> The board also plans to audit vendors to see if they are accurately reporting  taxable sales.  </P> <P> While there are no reliable estimates on swap-meet sales in the state, they  "have become big business in California and unique here because of our  weather," said Jay Swerdlow of the California Swap Meet Owners Assn. in Los  Angeles. "Shopping outdoors has become the thing to do."  </P> <P> The trade group welcomes the new law, according to Swerdlow, because it  believes that a few vendors do ignore the sales tax regulations.  </P> <P> "Many of our sellers are store owners who know the rules and are here because  they do better at a swap meet on the weekends than they do in their stores," he  said.  </P> <P> Swerdlow figures that results from the board's investigation will give the  fledgling swap-meet industry more "respectability."  </P></p>

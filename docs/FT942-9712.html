			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Tokyo to send trade delegation to US The Japanese government plans to take a first step toward restarting trade talks with the US by sending a delegation of senior officials to Washington next week. Mr Eijiro Hata, the new minister for international trade and industry, yesterday confirmed that a delegation of vice ministers - the most senior grade of civil servant - will go to Washington to discuss trade. This follows a phone call by Mr Tsutomu Hata, the prime minister (unrelated to Miti's Mr Hata) to US president Bill Clinton this week, in which they agreed to resume negotiations. Mr Walter Mondale, US ambassador to Japan, followed this with a visit to Miti's Mr Hata and Mr Koji Kakizawa, the foreign minister. The Miti minister did not specify which departments - likely to be Miti and the foreign ministry - would form the delegation or if they would have any specific proposals to break the deadlock reached in February, when Mr Clinton and former prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa agreed to disagree over US demands for targets for increased imports. The new Japanese government yesterday showed some evidence of the fresh pragmatism attributed to it by senior US officials, when Mr Kakizawa told parliament that 'some kind of criteria' were needed to measure progress.</p>

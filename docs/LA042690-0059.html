			<p><P> April 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EARNINGS  </P> <P> Sara Lee Corp.: The firm posted third-quarter profit of $109 million, up 15%  from the year-ago period.  </P> <P> Sales totaled $2.8 billion, down slightly from the 1989 quarter. The Chicago  firm, which markets a variety of brand name products including Hanes underwear,  L'eggs hosiery, Hillshire Farm and Jimmy Dean meats in addition to its baked  goods, attributed the results to weak sales of packaged meats and bakery  products. However, this was offset by gains from its coffee and grocery  division and packaged consumer products division.  </P></p>

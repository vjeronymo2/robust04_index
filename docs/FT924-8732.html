			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Scandal allegations irk Franco BRAZIL'S interim President Itamar Franco reacted angrily yesterday to allegations that he had been a financial beneficiary of the corruption scam that caused the demise of his predecessor, Mr Fernando Collor, and brought him to power last month. The charges were made by Mr Paulo Cesar Farias, the alleged front-man in the multi-million-dollar kickback scheme, who told reporters he had given money to Mr Franco while he was Mr Collor's vice president and during the 1989 elections. The claim sent the nervous Brazilian stock markets falling again. A furious Mr Franco challenged Mr Farias to present a copy of any cheque made out to him. Prosecution lawyers in Mr Collor's impeachment trial yesterday completed their report to the Senate, accusing him of 20 crimes, including electoral malpractice, tax evasion, and 'crimes of responsibility'.</p>

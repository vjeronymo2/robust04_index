			<p><P> June 28, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LENDL WIPES OUT SWISS HLASEK 6-1, 6-3, 6-0;  </P> <P> WIMBLEDON: PLAY SUSPENDED BRIEFLY IN FALSE ALARM BOMB SCARE. NAVRATILOVA  OVERWHELMS ANNE SMITH OF U.S.  </P> <P> Ivan Lendl's mission to finally win Wimbledon took another powerful step  forward today with a victory over a hard-hitting Swiss.  </P> <P> The top-ranked player in the world used pounding serves, sharply angled volleys  and a lot of skill to beat Jakob Hlasek of Switzerland 6-1, 6-3, 6-0 to advance  to the third round.  </P> <P> "He made me look bad because he played so good," said Hlasek, a quality player  ranked 50th in the world. "But not (only) did he play well, he has really  improved on grass. The whole game -- the volley, the serve, the confidence.  Everything."  </P> <P> Another player who has dedicated the season to winning Wimbledon, second-seeded  Martina Navratilova, looked overpowering, too. She beat Anne Smith of the  United States 6-2, 6-3.  </P> <P> Also advancing, although with a bit more difficulty, was Gabriela Sabatini. The  women's fourth seed from Argentina beat Anke Huber of West Germany 6-2, 7-6.  </P> <P> Out of the tournament went Henri Leconte. The 15th seed from France was  eliminated by Alex Antonitsch of Austria 2-6, 6-4, 7-6, 2-6, 6-3.  </P> <P> As the fourth day of the Grand Slam tournament played out in cool, breezy  weather, a bomb scare paralyzed part of the ground outside Centre Court for  about a half hour.  </P> <P> Play was suspended on three outside courts after a suspicious item -- it turned  out to be a camera in a leather case -- was found near the main gate. Police  bomb-squad officers gave the all-clear after checking the item with a portable  X-ray machine.  </P> <P> The victory by Antonitsch was built on a booming serve and passing shots, and  Leconte's mistakes. The Frenchman double-faulted and flubbed a volley in the  eighth game of the fifth set to give Antonitsch the service break he needed for  victory.  </P> <P> Leconte was the eighth seed out of the men's draw with the third round not even  finished. He had been seeded to meet Lendl in the fourth round.  </P> <P> Lendl played almost-perfect tennis in racing by Hlasek in 78 minutes. His only  lapse came when he tried to be perhaps too fancy in his first service game,  after opening with an ace. He double-faulted to 30-40 when he smacked two hard  serves instead of trying to get the second serve in, then lost the game on a  lob by Hlasek.  </P> <P> After that, however, Lendl toyed with Hlasek, who beat the top seed in the  Masters in New York in 1988. Lendl won six straight games and never lost serve  again.  </P> <P> Lendl polished off the match with a 20-minute third set in which he seemed at  times to be playing in slow motion, winding up and gunning shots left and right  at the helpless Hlasek. He ended the match with an ace and a pair of service  winners.  </P> <P> "I returned well, I lobbed well," Lendl said. "I think I can play a bit better.  I can definitely make more first serves."  </P> <P> Lendl hit on only 62% of his first serves, the same as Hlasek. It was the only  part of the game on which the two were equals.  </P> <P> Navratilova, seeking a record ninth Wimbledon crown, overwhelmed Smith in the  early going but appeared to be having some problems with her left leg as the  match wound down.  </P> <P> Smith did not get a break point until the eighth game of the second set. She  broke at love then, on three Navratilova errors and a passing shot, and  stretched her mini-streak to seven points when she went up 15-0 in the ninth  game. But Navratilova, who complained of a sore knee last week, broke back for  the match.  </P> <P> Other seeds advanced easily as well. Men's ninth seed Jim Courier beat Jason  Stoletenberg of Australia 6-2, 7-6, 6-4. Women's No. 7 Katerina Maleeva beat  Kimiko Date of Japan 6-1, 6-4, and No. 14 Judith Wiesner of Austria beat Karine  Quentrec of France 6-3, 6-3.  </P> <P> A former semifinalist, American Kevin Curren, beat South Africa's Gary Muller  in a marathon match, 6-7 (1-7), 6-4, 7-6 (7-4), 6-7 (3-7), 6-4. Muller  eliminated seventh-seeded Tim Mayotte in the first round.  </P></p>

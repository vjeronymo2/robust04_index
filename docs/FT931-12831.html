			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Glaxo to re-enter OTC market GLAXO, Europe's largest pharmaceuticals company, yesterday confirmed its intention to re-enter the over the counter (OTC) non-prescription drugs market. The group announced that Mr Arthur Pappas, an existing board director, would take responsibility for OTC products. His task, according to the company, will be to develop and implement an OTC strategy for the group's existing product portfolio. All possible methods of achieving this would be reviewed, said Glaxo. According to analysts, this might include creating, manufacturing and marketing OTC products from scratch, making an acquisition, or securing a series of co-development and co-marketing alliances. During the past week, both the UK and US analysts have been worried that Glaxo might dilute its earnings by acquiring Warner-Lambert, the US' fourth largest OTC group after Proctor and Gamble, Johnson &amp; Johnson, and American Home Products. Glaxo's shares fell 13p yesterday to 682p in a sharply rising market. Mr Mark Brewer, pharmaceuticals analyst at brokers Credit Lyonnais Laing, said Glaxo's announcement was part of a strategy to protect some of Zantac's cash-flow. New drugs, such as Astra's Losec are taking market share. The medicine's US patents up to 2002 are also being challenged. If they are successfully challenged, the drug could face generic competition after 1995. Mr Pappas is relocating from Singapore to the US where both of Glaxo's main competitors in the anti-ulcer market, Merck with Pepcid and SmithKline Beecham with Tagamet, are planning to move their products OTC. Analysts believed that Glaxo would be unable to convince regulatory authorities to license full-strength Zantac for OTC use, and would have to combine a weaker version with some form of anti-acid for upset stomachs. Mr Pappas keeps his position as managing director for Latin America. He is handing over responsibility for Asia Pacific to Mr Neil Maidment, managing director Glaxo China and Glaxo Hong Kong who becomes an executive director.</p>

			<p><P> June 20, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> AIR FORCE STILL PREFERS TRUCKING OF ROCKET FUEL;  </P> <P> STUDY: OFFICIALS SAY HAULING THE DANGEROUS CHEMICALS THROUGH SOUTHERN  CALIFORNIA IS PREFERABLE TO MOVING IT BY BARGE OR RAIL.  </P> <P> The Air Force has concluded that its current practice of trucking dangerous  rocket fuel to Vandenberg Air Force Base through Southern California is  preferable to shipping it by barge through the Panama Canal or transporting it  by rail, Pentagon officials said Tuesday.  </P> <P> An 18-month Air Force study found that transporting the volatile chemicals --  which are poisonous and explosive -- by barge is infeasible, although moving  them by rail through the San Fernando Valley and Ventura County merits further  review. But the initial assessment determined that trucking them through the  Mojave Desert north of Los Angeles to the base near Lompoc remains the best  option, Capt. Sigmund Adams said.  </P> <P> The report cited Coast Guard regulations prohibiting bulk shipments of rocket  fuels by barge and capital outlays needed to transport them by rail. In  addition, it said that in an accident, either method could jeopardize more  people than trucking because barges and rail cars would carry larger shipments  than trucks.  </P> <P> The assessment was requested by Rep. Robert J. Lagomarsino (R-Ojai) in late  1987 in response to reports that components of the fuel used to launch military  rockets were being shipped by truck on the Ventura Freeway through the densely  populated San Fernando Valley and northward through Ventura County.  </P> <P> The chemicals include nitrogen tetroxide, which can be fatal if inhaled.  </P> <P> Protests by elected officials over trucking the fuel components through the San  Gabriel Valley -- across Pasadena, Glendale and Burbank -- and then through the  San Fernando Valley and into Ventura County prompted the Air Force to redirect  the shipments.  </P> <P> A northern highway route through less-populated Barstow, Mojave, Gorman,  Mariposa and Santa Maria was selected.  </P> <P> "These propellants have been shipped via tank trailer over the nation's  highways for more than 25 years without a single recordable accident or  incident resulting in a spill or major loss of product while in transit," said  the San Antonio Air Logistics Center at Kelly Air Force Base in San Antonio in  an executive summary of the study. The center conducted the study for the Air  Force.  </P> <P> Lagomarsino has asked the House Merchant Marine Committee and Fisheries and  Government Operations Committee to review the nearly 200-page study, which was  completed in December and released to the lawmaker Tuesday.  </P> <P> In the meantime, Lagomarsino expressed disappointment that the Air Force did  not fully assess the idea that shipping the rocket fuel by barge could enhance  safety. He also dismissed consideration of the rail option.  </P> <P> "It would appear on the face of it the rail shipment would expose many more  people to risk than the current truck routing" by taking larger shipments of  the fuels through more heavily populated areas than the current highway route,  said John Doherty, a senior aide to Lagomarsino.  </P> <P> Rail shipments would be carried on the Southern Pacific railroad coastal route,  which parallels the Ventura Freeway through the San Fernando Valley, eastern  Ventura County and Santa Barbara.  </P> <P> The Air Force study assessed the operational, regulatory, and risk and safety  factors of five means of transportation: barge containers; rail cars or  tractor-trailers carried by barges; rail tank cars; containers or tank trucks  on flat-bed railroad cars and one-ton cylinders or drums on rail cars.  </P> <P> The Air Force said it did not assess whether shipping the fuel in barge  containers would improve safety because it found that Coast Guard regulations  prohibit the shipping of rocket fuels by barge. At the same time, it said  transporting the fuel in rail cars or tank trucks on barges would place fewer  people at risk because of the remoteness of the water route.  </P> <P> But, it added, "Handling risk associated with barge transport appears  considerably higher than for the rail modes, and mitigated the risk benefits of  remote water routes."  </P> <P> Doherty, however, maintained that Congress could modify the Coast Guard  regulations and that perhaps the potential benefits of shipment by sea would  make the effort worthwhile.  </P> <P> "The safety aspect was the whole reason for the study," Doherty said. "The  risks may have been so much less compared to anything else that it would have  justified the additional hassle."  </P> <P> Air Force spokesman Adams said he was unable to respond immediately to  Doherty's assertion.  </P> <P> Nitrogen tetroxide is transported in 3,057-gallon trucks across seven states  from Vicksburg, Miss., where it is manufactured, by a company under contract  with the Air Force. As many as two rocket fuel shipments are made each month,  depending on Vandenberg's launch schedule, although there have been none in  1990, said Phoebe Brown, a San Antonio Air Logistics Center spokeswoman.  </P></p>

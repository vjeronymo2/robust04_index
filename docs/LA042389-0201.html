			<p><P> April 23, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> ST. BERNARD WIN DROPS BOSCO OUT OF CAMINO REAL TIE  </P> <P> The Bosco Tech Tigers suffered a slow, painful defeat to the St. Bernard  Vikings on Saturday at St. Bernard's Father Dunphy Field, 13-3.  </P> <P> Before this weekend's games, the Tigers were ranked No. 9 in the CIF 2-A poll  and were in a first-place tie with El Segundo and St. Bernard in the Camino  Real League.  </P> <P> St. Bernard took advantage of seven Bosco errors to record an easy victory in  the three-hour game. St. Bernard, 13-3 overall, and El Segundo are tied for the  league lead with 7-1 records. Bosco now holds second place at 6-2 -- both  losses coming to St. Bernard -- and has a 10-6 overall mark.  </P> <P> "Our kids do not know how to be successful," said Bosco Coach Al Cone. "It's  the first time the program has been in a playoff hunt, and we aren't playing  well. (Dan) Melendez did what he wanted with us for the second straight time."  </P> <P> Melendez improved his record to 6-0 and struck out 11 Tigers before leaving the  mound in the sixth inning. He shut out Bosco, 3-0, the last time the teams met.  But he lost his shutout Saturday on the second pitch he threw. Bosco shortstop  Javier Ramirez led off the game with a home run to left field. Ramirez provided  all the Bosco offense, going 4 for 4 with a double and scoring all three runs.  </P> <P> Melendez had little trouble with anyone else. He also hit his ninth homer of  the year, giving him 28 in his career, four shy of the CIF Southern Section  record.  </P> <P> In the bottom of the second inning, the Vikings tied the score on a one-out RBI  single by Grant Hohman. Then Phil Ruhl reached base on a sure double play ball  that was muffed by shorstop Ramirez. St. Bernard left fielder Bobby Waller was  hit by losing pitcher Genaro Esparza, loading the bases.  </P> <P> Hohman scored on a bunt that was dropped by third baseman Jason Armendarez.  Jeff Richardson slapped a single to right field that rolled through the legs of  Bobby Saetia for a two-base error, making the score 5-1.  </P> <P> The Vikings added two runs in the third inning, three in the fourth --  including Melendez's solo homer -- and a three-run homer by Al Ibarra in the  fifth. Bosco Tech scored one run in the third and one in the fifth.  </P> <P> St. Bernard, ranked No. 4 in the CIF 2-A, appears headed to a showdown with No.  2 ranked-El Segundo, whose only league loss is to Bosco Tech.  </P></p>

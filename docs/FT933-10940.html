			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / Sport: Formula One sees trouble in the mirror - The grand prix elite are desperate to win back fans and sponsors and head off a threat from north America LAST weekend, at the German motor racing grand prix at Hockenheim, the elite teams of Formula One finally accepted that they had been overtaken by market forces. At the end of a six-hour meeting during which, in a rare spirit of compromise, 'every team gave up something', according to championship-leading team principal Frank Williams, they agreed to abandon, from the start of next season, much of the technology which has long been claimed as a large part of the sport's raison d'etre. Fisa, motor sport's world governing body, still has to ratify the deal. But Max Mosley, Fisa's president, believes the result of the leading teams' sacrifice will be cheaper, closer and more enthralling racing. In the Fisa scenario, more teams will be able to afford to compete effectively and drivers will once more be in total control of their cars, rather than sharing them with electronic systems. The leading teams had little choice. To have rejected the deal would have been to plunge grand prix racing deep into crisis at a time when the globalisation of television is allowing potential rivals for sponsors' dollars to emerge. The most notable rival is north America's IndyCar championship in which last year's grand prix champion, Nigel Mansell of Britain, now competes. Even Frank Williams acknowledges that F1 needs to offer spectators more. Critics argue that the sport offers poor value for spectators. The racing, they say, is often processional, admission prices are excessive and there is an unacceptably elitist attitude towards the paying public. 'Admission and a grandstand seat at Silverstone this year cost at least Pounds 117,' says one observer closely involved with IndyCar. 'At Laguna Seca (an IndyCar circuit) you simply can't spend more than Dollars 75 (Pounds 50.30). 'For that you get to see, and maybe speak to, the drivers and watch the crews working on their cars. At Silverstone I almost felt guilty being inside the paddock watching all these guys, who'd paid all that money, with their noses pressed to the mesh fence and hoping for maybe a glimpse of one of their heroes.' One small sign that grand prix racing is already responding to such criticism was the grudging parade of drivers reinstated after many years at Silverstone. But the sport still has a long way to go. The attendance at Silverstone was 60,000 - half last year's crowd. Admittedly, Mansell was absent, recession in the UK had taken another year's toll and attendances at other grands prix have not been as hard hit. Nevertheless, the spectacle at Silverstone was enough to furrow brows at a time when sponsors are more determined to gain value for money. Mosley says that the cost savings of the technology ban should be substantial. He estimates that some changes introduced at the start of this year, such as fewer permitted tyres and reduced practice times, will have saved each team between Pounds 1m and Pounds 2m by the end of the season. He calculates that the new rules will save teams between Pounds 2m and Pounds 10m a year. The combined changes should thus lead to cost savings of 25-50 per cent. The benefits will be greatest for the smaller teams. 'At the moment, that team can go to a potential sponsor and almost certainly will be asked if it's got 'active' suspension. It's obliged to say No because it can't afford it, and the potential sponsor won't back it because it hasn't got it. That kind of problem will disappear with the new rules,' says Mosley. Almost certainly, the technology ban will have little or no effect on the outcome of future grands prix: Williams, McLaren and their ilk are still likely to be winners because they will continue to work more effectively and efficiently with the technology and resources available. At best, the gap between the first and last cars will close. But Frank Williams says Fisa may have miscalculated on technology costs. 'In reality we haven't spent a great deal of money on our technology; it's been mainly brain power.' And he warns that there is a potential downside. A lot of companies who currently sponsor grand prix racing, such as computer and electronics groups Bull (Williams) and Hewlett Packard (Benetton) are heavily technology-based. 'Clearly they are not pleased and will have taken note', says Williams. Should companies like these reduce their involvement, grand prix racing is likely to become more dependent for its funding on companies with no direct involvement in motor sport or the motor industry. Furthermore, sponsors may seek to impose on teams cost-containment of their own. Warning signals are already flying. Philip Morris, whose Marlboro livery is synonymous with that of McLaren, is one of motor sport's most consistent supporters. In the last few weeks Walter Thoma, president of Philip Morris Europe, has made thinly-veiled criticisms of those leading teams, by implication McLaren included, who have sought to preserve the status quo. 'It is important that we understand the need for cost containment in Formula One. There are one or two self-interested groups within the sport that pay no attention to the world recession.' He also maintains that there must be containment not just of the teams' costs and their technology, but of the whole infrastructure. 'Why must there always be three-day events? Can some not be run on a Saturday and a Sunday? Why not run shorter races? How much shorter should they be? Is the show pricing itself ahead of inflation? . . . when we look at the future, we must consider the totality and not just isolated issues.' On the surface, when compared with IndyCar, grand prix racing certainly appears self-indulgent. As David Peevers, publisher of IndyCar 93 magazine, points out: 'The very top IndyCar teams are on budgets of maybe Dollars 15m a year, perhaps one-fifth of a top grand prix team's. And you can buy it all off the shelf, from people like (UK-based) Lola for chassis and Cosworth or Ilmor for engines. You're talking about maybe Dollars 500,000 for the car, Dollars 50,000 for an engine - and basically that's it, you can be out racing. It should be about two drivers pitting their skills against each other, not sitting there on the grid worrying about which of the computer programmers programmed their traction control that morning'. Peevers' belief that IndyCar racing is more exciting than grand prix appears to be shared by television. ITV claims that UK audiences of 3.5m watch its Indy offering each week. That begs the question of how big the 'Mansell factor' is, and whether interest in IndyCar racing outside north America will disappear when Mansell retires or returns to F1. A litmus test of whether Indy really is a potentially serious rival may come in October. The IndyCar 'circus' will use this weekend's championship round in Michigan to finalise an announcement, likely to be made next week, that they intend to stage a non-championship race, Mansell included, at Brands Hatch on October 10. There are some difficulties: under arrangements within Fisa, Indy cars can race only on ovals if they venture outside north America. Brands Hatch is not an oval, but few expect Fisa to stand in the race's way; the exercise is too fascinating for all concerned with motor sport. Will it be a sell-out? Will it, in the end, be as nerve-wracking 'in the flesh' as its proponents claim it is on television? As the architect of the grand prix technology ban, Mosley says he does not see IndyCar as a threat. Sponsors' budgets have been trimmed back this year and face further cuts in 1994. The prospect of sharing the cake with an emergent international rival should be worrying. But Williams says there is little 'cross-pollination' in terms of sponsorship and that IndyCar will remain too parochial to impinge on grand prix's financial patch. In any case, he says, there are 'vast numbers of substantial potential sponsors of F1' which grand prix has not yet learned how to tap. In spite of grand prix's slick public image, he says, its marketing skills still lag far behind its engineering capabilities. In Mosley's view, F1 has been saved from itself by banning, before they arrived, such innovations as computer-controlled four-wheel steering. But once the recession is over, Mosley himself wants the technology chase to continue. He wants to rearrange the technical regulations so that research goes into areas such as fuel efficiency. He wants to see intensified work on aerodynamics, particularly in the area between the bottom of the chassis and the ground. He wants to see technological development of fuels and fuel efficiency. Down this route, he argues, lies not just better racing but a contribution to the world's energy problems, and the continuing support of its motor industry.</p>

			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / Letter: Another view of pessimism Sir, I note Observer's explanation ('Sure?', June 9) that the difference between an optimist and a pessimist is that the former does not have all the facts. I prefer Robert Oppenheimer's explanation that 'the optimist believes that this is the best of all possible worlds, and the pessimist fears that he may be right'.

			<p><P> February 5, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP CAPSULES : SPLENDID RACKET FROM ART-BANGERS GUTBUCKET  </P> <P> There's something in a young artist that likes banging on things, preferably on  stage with a large group of friends, and there's a long tradition of neo-tribal  post-art-school percuss-O-rama in Los Angeles. Gutbucket, the newest  art-bangers, put a hip-hop twist on the genre at LACE on Friday, occasionally  sounding more like a Public Enemy backing track than like the more traditional  Gary Glitter-meets-"Ummagumma" treatment.  </P> <P> Above the splendid racket of a half-dozen guys pounding congas, oil drums,  trap-sets and whatever, trumpeter Michael Whitmore blew the kind of breathy,  dour solos that Ornette Coleman plays when he picks up a trumpet, and a fellow  named Chrono muttered Beat-ish groove rhymes. Local painter Anthony Ausgang  scratched along on turntables, Jeff Kaufman pinned down the meandering beats  with coherently funky bass riffs and leader Vinzula Kara wailed stylishly on  melodica.  </P> <P> At times the jams got repetitive, and this sort of thing is invariably more fun  to play in than to listen to. Still, with blurry slides flashing past in the  background and a wandering video cameraman seemingly as much a part of the band  as the percussionist, Gutbucket was a low-budget, total-media assault.

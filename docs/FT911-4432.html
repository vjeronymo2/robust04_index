			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / UK Company News: David S Smith asks for Pounds 50.7m to refinance Kent mill DAVID S Smith, the largest paper-maker in the UK, yesterday launched a Pounds 50.7m rights issue to refinance its investment in the Kemsley paper mill in Kent. The issue, on a 1-for-4 basis at 295p, was well received by the stock market with the shares unchanged at 360p. The issue was accompanied by a forecast of pre-tax profits of not less than Pounds 23.5m (Pounds 26.4m) for the year to end-April, much in line with analysts' expectations. The company also promised a final dividend of 6.75p (6.5p) to give a total of 9.5p (9.25p). The Kemsley mill was bought for Pounds 10.6m in 1989 and since then the group has spent Pounds 40m upgrading and increasing the capacity of two paper machines there. Smith had always said the purchase was a long-term investment which would take some years to pay off. Mr Richard Brewster, chief executive, who is leaving the company at the end of this month, said that so far the investment had been funded from cashflow, despite poor trading conditions. However, it now seemed a good moment to raise equity capital to refinance it. A further Pounds 24m is expected to be spent on the mill, to bring capacity up to 350,000 tonnes a year compared to 170,000 at the time of acquisition. The total cost of the mill will be substantially less than it would have cost to build the same capacity from scratch. After repaying debt of Pounds 37.7m, the group will be left with some cash. Mr Peter Williams, Mr Brewster's replacement at Smith, said other divisions were looking to expand both organically and by acquisition. Mr Brewster said these businesses had been somewhat held back because of the heavy investment at Kemsley.</p>

			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Construction Contracts: Trinidad work goes to Wimpey A Pounds 58m scheme to upgrade an oil refinery in Trinidad heads a list of contracts totalling more than Pounds l00m awarded to WIMPEY Construction in the past four weeks. The project - for the Petroleum Company of Trinidad and Tobago - is one of two contracts secured by Wimpey in the area, bringing the total value of new work in the country to Pounds 77m. Mr Dennis Brant, chairman of Wimpey Construction said: 'We have been established in the Caribbean for more than 37 years but have seen little activity in the area for the past decade. 'Recently, however, there has been a substantial increase in the construction workload. It is a similar story in other ports of the world, for example, the Middle East and the Far East. 'Wimpey has seen a noticeable upswing in activity in these areas.' The company's other contracts are in the UK. They include three schemes totalling Pounds 16m for projects in the retail sector, two health care projects and a Pounds 10.5m design and build leisure development in Hertfordshire. 'Retail, leisure and health care remain among the most buoyant areas of activity for the UK construction industry,' Mr Brant says.</p>

			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / International Capital Markets: China to issue Yn100bn in Treasuries this year China is planning to issue Yn100bn in Treasury bonds for 1994 to meet the voracious demands of infrastructure spending. This more than doubles last year's Yn40bn float. The finance ministry on Tuesday began marketing a second batch of bonds for the year worth Yn10bn. The one-year bonds carry an interest rate of 11.98 per cent. Chinese officials expect a better response to this year's flotation than last year. The government encouraged individuals and institutions in 1993 to buy bonds after a disappointing response. Investors found coupon rates in an inflationary environment on the 1993 issue unappealing. They favoured alternatives such as equities, but the poor performance of China's stock markets this year will have improved bond prospects. The finance ministry said the doubling of the bond issue for this year compared with 1993 was dictated by government demand for funds.</p>

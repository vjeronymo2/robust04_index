			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Guatemala risks loss of loans The Guatemalan government is facing a fiscal crisis and will probably fail to meet conditions imposed by official creditors. This follows Congress having resisted crucial draft legislation this month. Congress failed to pass before the summer recess tax reforms which the finance ministry hoped would offset sharp revenue losses this year and hold the government's tax take at 8.5 per cent of GDP. The reforms were to include stiffer sanctions for tax evaders, the abolition of many value-added tax exemptions, and the introduction of a 2 per cent capital tax. The government may now fail to meet June 30 fiscal targets set by the International Monetary Fund. That would lead to a freeze of a Dollars 35m (Pounds 23m) financial sector loan from the Inter-American Development Bank and of a Dollars 42m structural adjustment loan from the World Bank. The tax reform package was also opposed by Guatemala's powerful private sector, where it was claimed that the finance ministry was corrupt and inefficient, and that improved tax collection was needed rather than reform. Congress has also blocked approval of relatively soft terms agreed between the government and Paris Club creditors last year, which must be ratified by next Tuesday. Congress is now in recess and is not due to return until after Congressional elections, due to be held in August. Ministers say they still hope for Congressional approval of the Paris Club deal in an extra session, but this would require political bargaining. The private sector has long regarded tax increases as anathema to its interests, although Guatemala has one of the lowest taxation rates in the western hemisphere. Economists say that, if no changes are made, the tax take will drop below 7 per cent of GDP, widening the fiscal deficit and jeopardising much-needed social investment.</p>

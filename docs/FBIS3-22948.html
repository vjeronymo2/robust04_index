			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Tension in Libyan-Jordanian </F> Relations"]    [Excerpts] London, Amman, Beirut, Tripoli, Political  Studies Center, news agencies -- [passage omitted] Reports in  Amman linked Libya's support of the Fatah-Revolutionary Council  to the extent of its involvement in al-Ma'ayitah's  assassination, especially as the Jordanian monarch, King Husayn,  pointed to the role of an Arab capital in the incident. [passage  omitted]    Some observers believe that Syria is currently trying to  resolve matters between Jordan and Libya. The Syrians believe  that any Jordanian pressure on Tripoli in this connection would  weaken the latter's position in the worsening Lockerbie crisis.  At any rate, it seems that Jordan is trying to identify the  clues to this issue outside Jordanian territory, as the  information available has not indicated that Jordanian security  services have taken any actions against members of the  Fatah-Revolutionary Council or made any arrests in this  connection. It seems that it is seeking to get hold of all  clues in light of the investigations with those suspected of  carrying out the assassination operation in question in Lebanon,  and to determine whether they have any link with members of this  organization in Jordan.</p>

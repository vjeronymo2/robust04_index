			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / International Company News: Capital Cities/ABC expands in Europe CAPITAL Cities/ABC, the US media group that owns the ABC television network, is to make further inroads into Europe by taking a stake in a Scandinavian commercial television operator. It has agreed to buy 21 per cent of the shares in the Luxembourg-based Scandinavian Broadcasting System for about Dollars 40m and will have the right to increase its stake to 25 per cent by buying another 500,000 shares on the open market. SBS's shares, which are traded in the US on the Nasdaq market, rose Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 20 1/2 . SBS owns and operates four commercial television stations in Scandinavia. They are TV Norge in Norway and TV5 in Sweden, both satellite-to-cable television stations; Kanal 2 in Denmark, an over-the-air television station; and TV Fynboen in Odense, serving Denmark's third largest city. US broadcasters have been keen to expand their interests in Europe because they see opportunities for growth in a fast-deregulating market. Capital Cities/ABC has already bought stakes in several European media companies, including Hamster, a French programme maker, Tesauro, a Spanish producer, Molinaire, a UK production company, and Tele-Munchen, a German producer. Mr Herbert Granath, president of Capital Cities' newly-formed ABC Cable and International Group, said the company's earlier experiences had given it confidence in the future of ventures formed with knowledgeable local managers in growing media markets.</p>

			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Leading Article: Allies of circumstance This week's air raids on Serb positions in Bosnia and Croatia, involving dozens of aircraft from at least four nations, have at least in technical terms been a spectacular demonstration of Nato's ability to marshal and co-ordinate the use of force. It has taken 45 years, billions of dollars, and great firmness of will to refine the procedures by which, for example, US command systems can guide the activities of UK aircraft carriers or Dutch bombers based in Italy. Yet Nato is getting its first chance to show off these hard-won skills at the very moment when the transatlantic solidarity on which it is based is being questioned on both sides of the ocean. Precisely because Nato succeeded so well in the purpose for which it was formed - facing down the Soviet bloc - it is going through a profound existential crisis, of which the latest arguments over Bosnia are only a symptom. The role of aerial policeman in Bosnia is one that fell into Nato's lap and does not suit the alliance particularly well. It leaves unresolved the longer-term question of what, if anything, the alliance is for. In the five years since the Berlin Wall came down, most debate about Nato's future has been couched in euphemistic terms which underestimate the seriousness of the problem. Commentators speak of new models for 'burden-sharing', and of Europe 'taking more responsibility for its own defence' - as if the general nature of these burdens and responsibilities was perfectly clear, and the only outstanding question was how precisely to allocate them. Regional challenges Such clarity of purpose did broadly exist during the cold war, when the Soviet threat was manifested on so many fronts that the common interest in confronting it scarcely needed to be discussed. Today, however, there is no overriding challenge which simultaneously, and in roughly equal measure, threatens North America, western Europe and Turkey; instead there is a host of regional challenges which affect different countries to a widely differing extent. For obvious reasons, the possibility of an extremist regime in North Africa acquiring ballistic missiles is something that haunts Spain and Italy far more vividly than it troubles Norway or Canada. Non-communist Russia remains an uncomfortable neighbour for Norway, and a tough regional rival for Turkey; but in the absence of any global east-west confrontation, both Oslo and Ankara are finding it much harder than before to win understanding of these concerns from their Nato partners. And on the issue of whether Nato should expand eastwards - at the risk of upsetting Moscow - there is no clear agreement within any of the leading western capitals, let alone among the alliance as a whole. Western unity On the face of things, the Serbs of Croatia have done the western security system a back-handed favour by mounting a series of air attacks which so flagrantly violated UN resolutions that the international community had little choice but to take action. At least for a moment, the Serbs goaded the western allies into rediscovering the unity which they formerly displayed in the face of the Soviet threat, and which had been conspicuously lacking in the previous two weeks of ill-tempered sparring over the arms embargo. The US, its European allies and even - at least initially - Russia were able to agree on the need to stop future air attacks on the Bosnian enclave of Bihac. But there is no guarantee that this display of unity will be maintained if Serb commanders decide to keep on testing it. Indeed, they may well calculate that sooner or later the strains within the contact group will resurface, and work to their advantage. The very survival of the western security institutions may depend on making sure such calculations are ill-founded. In any case, the 16 members of Nato should not leave it to the Serbs of Bosnia or Croatia, or any other provocateurs, to provide them with a sense of purpose. To retain credibility, they need to take the initiative in defining more clearly those areas where they still do perceive a common aim, and those where they feel they can afford to differ.</p>

			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / Out of pocket for making the grade: Good A-level results may mean students paying more for university education Britain's A-level examination results, which yesterday showed more pupils passing and at better grades than ever before, have intensified a funding crisis at universities. Ironically, this success will almost certainly mean other students having to pay at least part of their tuition bill in the future. Universities have made more offers of places than they can afford. No student who has fulfilled the conditions set will be turned away this year, but universities will reject more candidates than usual who have only narrowly missed their target results. Unless more money can be found, next year they will reduce the number of places on offer. The latest dilemma for universities comes after a war of attrition with the government over funding that has lasted since the early 1980s. Ministers are eager for more students to enter higher education, but have not addressed the other side of the equation: how the extra places are to be paid for. Mr John Patten, education secretary, who should return to his desk on Monday after a period of illness, knows that to put fresh burdens on middle-class parents would add to the government's political woes. Political decisions taken in apparent haste have not helped. The problems created by the A-level results follow a cut in government funding for classroom-based (mainly arts) subjects announced last December, when most offers for places for the 1993-94 academic year had been made. Adding to the pressures, applications for the academic year about to begin have increased by between 6 and 7 per cent. And yesterday's results show that the proportion of A-levels passed with one of the top three grades - usually required by universities - rose by 1.6 per cent. Something must now give. The most likely result is that those universities that have to accept more students than they can afford this year will cut back the offers they make next year by several thousand. Such forces lie behind the report today of the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals on alternatives for raising extra finance for higher education from students themselves. Without extra funds from somewhere, the committee warns, the ideal of mass higher education, as envisaged by the Lord Robbins' committee of inquiry report in 1963, would have to be abandoned. University heads will debate the various forms of taxes on graduates and announce a favoured alternative at the end of a meeting of the vice-chancellors committee on September 23. For the government, the prospect of raising an extra tax, even if it affects only one section of the population, is not appealing - particularly one that is likely to hit more affluent families the hardest. In 1984, faced with a revolt by backbench Tory MPs and by many middle-class parents, the Thatcher government executed a climbdown over the then education secretary Sir Keith Joseph's proposal that students should pay towards their tuition. With a smaller parliamentary majority, Mr John Major will be reluctant to risk a repeat of that episode. So the 'awkward game of tennis', as one vice-chancellor puts it, between the government and universities, over who should take responsibility for a decision on raising funds from students, has continued. An earlier shot came in May when vice-chancellors requested an extra Pounds 3.2bn for capital spending on top of sums already announced for 1993-94. They claimed Pounds 1.35bn of capital funding was needed just for backlog maintenance to buildings. It also asked for Pounds 581m for capital spending on teaching, and 55,000 more student beds over the next three years, at a cost of Pounds 818m. With the public sector borrowing requirement already approaching Pounds 50bn the request was unrealistic, as the committee knew. But the intention was to publicise the amount that universities needed, and to make it clear that the money would have to come from elsewhere if necessary. In June, Professor John Ashworth, head of the London School of Economics, unveiled a plan to make LSE students pay top-up tuition fees, with means-tested bursaries for those with difficulty paying. To the government, his announcement opened up the possibility of universities shouldering the opprobrium for introducing fees. Mr Tim Boswell, higher education minister, refused to block Prof Ashworth's plan, although he denied he would encourage it. In the end, the ruling academic board of the LSE voted against the proposals. Today the vice-chancellors' committee has taken the debate further by suggesting four methods of raising money from students, which would all delay payment until the students have graduated and are earning salaries. The idea is that the income of a pupil's family should have no impact on their decision to apply and that graduates who choose not to seek higher paid jobs should not be disadvantaged. The options are: A graduate tax. Graduates would pay a higher rate of income tax than non-graduates throughout their working lives. Graduates could start paying the extra tax once their income had passed a certain level. All funds raised from the tax would be earmarked for universities. A tuition fee paid through a loan. Repayments would be made via higher income tax payments, as with a graduate tax, so those with lower incomes would take longer to repay. London Economics, the consultancy which produced the report, suggests funds could be provided by either the Treasury or private banks, with the government guaranteeing against defaulting. A similar system has recently been introduced without great controversy in Australia. A fee for students' living costs again paid with a loan, repayment of which, made after graduation, would be linked to the tax system. Under this scheme, students would decide the size of the loan they wished to take out. Top-up tuition fees, again with a loan linked to the tax system. Institutions could exercise an option to set fees higher than those provided for by the public finances. This could add a controversial extra dimension to competition between universities. Although the report does not make a definite choice, it appears, on criteria such as cost, flexibility and acceptability, to favour the Australian-style system of tuition fees paid via state-subsidised loans. The graduate tax would raise the most revenue and be the cheapest to administer, but London Economics says it is the option likely to be opposed most by students. All the schemes, with the exception of the graduate tax, would require significant government subsidies, in the form of cheap loans. University principals are pressing for an early government response to the report. They point to the expansion in student numbers over the past four years, resulting from a deliberate government policy of promoting higher education and, until this year, increasing Treasury subsidies for tuition fees. In England, the number of students has risen by 46 per cent to 753,000 in the past four years, according to the Higher Education Funding Council - equivalent to creating 20 new large universities the size of those at Leeds and Manchester. Faced with the public finance squeeze, the government wants expansion to slow down. Hence its decision to cut tuition fees this year. The distress felt by this week's A-level candidates has revealed the crudeness of the government's control mechanism. With the publication of today's report, the ball is back in the government's court. It must make a decision soon if the benefits of Britain's swift expansion are not to be lost.* Review of Options for the Additional Funding of Higher Education, by London Economics.

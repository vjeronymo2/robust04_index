			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Proudfoot runs up deficit of Pounds 11m and seeks Pounds 9.6m Proudfoot, the management consultancy chaired by Lord Stevens and which has been extensively restructured, yesterday announced pre-tax losses of Pounds 10.9m for 1993 and a rights issue to raise Pounds 9.6m. The pre-tax deficit compares with a previous profit of Pounds 24.5m. It was struck after taking an exceptional charge of Pounds 20.2m on the closure last April of its operations in Sweden and Norway. The charge is made up of Pounds 2.6m of provisions, Pounds 15.7m of goodwill written off and trading losses of Pounds 1.9m. Profit from continuing operations after interest and before tax was Pounds 9.3m, down from a previous Pounds 30.8m. This was struck on turnover from continuing operations of Pounds 140.7m, 11 per cent down from Pounds 158.6m. Mr John Prosser, chief executive, said yesterday that the restructuring over the past 12 months had reduced the staff from 1,400 to less than 900. The group was now better focused on its core markets, and had been structured to fit in with the revenue levels achieved in the last half of the year. Operating profits for the second half were Pounds 9.5m, compared with Pounds 6.3m in the first half, and margins improved from 8 per cent in the first half to 15 per cent in the second. The rights issue would complete the restructuring and strengthen the capital base, Mr Prosser said. The balance sheet shows negative shareholders' funds of Pounds 23.9m. As at February 28 the group had net cash of Pounds 5.4m, compared with Pounds 14.3m at the end of the year. The rights issue, underwritten by Samuel Montagu, is on a 2-for-7 basis at 60p. Yesterday the shares closed 3p higher at 71p. Losses per share emerged at 25p (earnings 17.5p). A final dividend of 1.5p is proposed, making a total for the year of 3.5p (12p), in line with the company policy of paying out 40 per cent of earnings per share from continuing operations.</p>

			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / 'Earth matters' taking a back seat THE ENVIRONMENT is 'taking a back seat to the global recession,' Dr Mustapha Tolba, executive directive of the UN environment programme, warned yesterday, Bronwen Maddox, Environment Correspondent, reports. 'For ten years and more 'environment and development' has been on everybody's lips but despite all the talk we find there is no hard scientific evidence for any real improvement,' he declared. Last night it emerged that Ms Elizabeth Dowdeswell, assistant deputy environment minister in Canada, will take over in January from Dr Tolba, who is stepping down after 16 years. Dr Tolba's speech, which fiercely attacked the ineffectiveness of the Rio Earth Summit in June, accompanied Unep's report on the world environment since 1972. Last night ministers from UN countries began flying to Nairobi to mark Unep's 20th anniversary. Despite Dr Tolba's pessimistic comments, Unep's 800-page report finds encouragement in the measures industrialised countries have taken to curb pollution. In the US, Canada and western Germany, carbon monoxide emissions, mainly from traffic, fell by more than 25 per cent between the mid-1970s and the late 1980s. The study identifies pollution in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union as one of Europe's greatest problems.</p>

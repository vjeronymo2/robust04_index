			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Italian press sings team's praises Like shot starlings, Italy's dailies changed tune after Italy's classy extra-time defeat of Nigeria on Tuesday, which put them into the quarter-finals against Spain. For more than a fortnight the Italian press has rubbished the team, the coach and especially star Roberto Baggio. But Baggio scored with two minutes to go against Nigeria, then banged in an extra-time penalty. La Gazzetta dello Sport's banner headline said: 'Italia: Baggiooooo]' while Il Manifesto managed: 'Forza Buddha' (Let's Go Buddha) referring to Baggio's religion. Celebrations were marred in Naples where Salvatore Oliva, 7, was accidentally killed when his 15-year-old cousin fired his father's pistol to celebrate, news reports said. The cousin was charged with manslaughter.</p>

			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] In a recent interview, Sejm Speaker  Jozef Oleksy, a prominent member of the Democratic Left Alliance  (SLD), stressed that his party and the coalition government  would not sacrifice economic growth by defending wage-earners  too zealously. Oleksy, in the 26 December Poznan weekly WPROST,  denied that the new Sejm has "Santa Claus" tendencies, asserting  that the Sejm deputies have a "strong sense of realism" and that  the Polish Left realizes it must play "a different role" from  what left-wing parties play "in countries with a stabilized  market economy." He maintained that the Polish Left knows it  must "work out, together with the world of capital, a mutual  concept of action that will lead to economic growth." He argued  that it is a mistake to assume links between political parties  and particular interest groups, noting that "the Polish  political scene is just beginning to be formed" and that the  links between parties and interest groups "are not completely  established."    Assessing the possibility of losing popular support, Oleksy  acknowledged that the governing coalition of the SLD and the  Polish Peasant Party (PSL) faces a dilemma in formulating its  economic policies: It cannot count on the patience of the  voters, who elected it primarily because of their "anger" over  the policies of the former government. What makes the  coalition's predicament particularly difficult, Oleksy said, is  that the people, while voting for a change in policy, "are  unable to state precisely what their expectations are." Without  a clear signal from the voters, Oleksy averred, the SLD will  have to strike a balance between its campaign promises and "the  rigors of economic realism." He observed that the local  elections in June would be a barometer of the government's  popular support, with a "clear" loss indicating that "hope in  the coalition government is ebbing" and a victory strengthening  the government's position.</p>

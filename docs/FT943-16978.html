			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / Leading Article: Not the SFO The division of labour between Britain's Serious Fraud Office (SFO) and the Fraud Investigation Group (FIG) of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has always been somewhat arbitrary. While the SFO has more draconian powers both to investigate and prosecute, both organisations deal with serious and complex fraud cases. It is therefore hard to argue with the suggestion of an official review body that the less difficult element of FIG's case load should be shunted elsewhere in the Crown Prosecution Service and the heavier stuff handled in a merged organisation, as foreshadowed by the Royal Commission on Criminal Justice. The review nonetheless flunks an important test in failing to decide whether the merged body should be placed in an enlarged SFO or within the Crown Prosecution Service. This is admittedly a hot potato, since it invites questions about why the government felt impelled to set up a separate high-profile agency in the first place and whether it remains committed to attacking serious fraud. While administrative logic would point to the merged body going into the CPS, such an approach would clash with the CPS's existing policy of remaining independent of the police and not being directly involved in the investigative process. Part of the advantage of a merger is that the SFO's very effective powers of questioning and evidence gathering under Section Two of the Criminal Justice Act 1987 could be extended over a larger number of serious and complex cases. This would imply either a big increase in investigative resources, or an extension of Section Two powers beyond the SFO's lawyers and accountants to the police. Yet there is bound to be unease about any increase in the area of the criminal justice system in which the right to silence no longer applies - especially since the review body found that the authorisation procedures for the service of Section Two notices were surprisingly informal. A wide debate on the procedures suggested by the review body for the issue of such notices is needed. That said, the administrative case for a merged organisation to deal with serious and complex fraud is overwhelming on resource allocation grounds and is further strengthened by the recent decline in the SFO's case load. The real question is how to go about it. Practical considerations point to an enlargement of the SFO, since the alternative option of putting the merged body within the CPS would require legislation. The Criminal Justice Act would have to be amended and the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 might also require adjustment. This would delay implementation of the reform until at least 1996, which would cast doubt on the government's enthusiasm for the task. Given the mixed record of the SFO since its inception, that is a poor political signal to be sending now.</p>

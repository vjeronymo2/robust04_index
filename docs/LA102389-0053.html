			<p><P> October 23, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEMO: TALE OF THREE CITIES  </P> <P> The city of Los Angeles licenses about 1,150 cabs -- scarcely one-tenth the  number (11,787) of authorized cabs cruising New York City.  </P> <P> To own a cab in New York, one must purchase a "medallion" that typically sells  for a whopping $140,000. In Los Angeles, an owner/operator buys into a taxicab  association for an initial cost of about $27,000.  </P> <P> On average, Los Angeles suspends two or three drivers a week for overcharging,  discourtesy or other infractions, according to Department of Transportation  Engineer David G. Leatherman. In New York City, 137 cab drivers were recently  suspended in a single week, according to Tony Carter, a spokesman for that  city's Taxi &amp; Limousine Commission.  </P> <P> By contrast, courtesy seems to abound north of the border. In Toronto -- which  boasts about 3,300 licensed cabs -- suspensions average a mere 50 drivers a  year for similar infractions, according to Roy Van Veen, director of  administration for the Metropolitan Licensing Commission. Taxi drivers in  Toronto are expected to be "civil and well-behaved," Van Veen said. "I guess  it's tradition. Cab drivers know the rules." KATHRYN HARRIS  </P></p>

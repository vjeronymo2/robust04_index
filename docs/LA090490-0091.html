The state government in  Indian-ruled Kashmir virtually collapsed as about 135,000 public employees  began a weeklong strike to protest the alleged brutality of Indian security  police. At least nine people were killed in clashes between protesters and the  security forces in the Kashmir Valley, where Muslim militants are campaigning  for independence or merger with Pakistan.  </P></p>

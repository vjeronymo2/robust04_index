			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / International Company News: Peru steps up campaign to sell airline PERU has moved forward to August the sale of Aeroperu, the state airline, according to Admiral Dante Matellini, the carrier's president. The government has accelerated its privatisation programme and placed a Dollars 50m price tag on the airline. Several large international carriers - including Iberia, Continental and Singapore Airlines - have expressed interest. Two firm bids have been submitted, one of them involving the company's pilots and possibly an outside airline. The other is from a consortium of Taca (Transportes Aereos de CentroAmerica) and a Peruvian transport group headed by entrepreneur Mr Rodriguez Banda. The consortium is offering around Dollars 25m cash plus further investment of between Dollars 100m and Dollars 150m in a new fleet. Under this proposal, the government would probably retain a percentage of the shares temporarily, and sell them later on the local stock exchange. Aeroperu was independently valued at Dollars 54m six months ago; its routes account for around half that. Its eight aircraft, only five of which are operational, are worth some Dollars 15m. Other assets include a site at Lima's Jorge Chavez airport and administrative buildings. The company is presently running up an operating loss of Dollars 1.5m a month, mainly due to overstaffing. It plans to cut its workforce of 1,800 by around half. The government has come up with Dollars 6m to cover redundancy payments for 800.</p>

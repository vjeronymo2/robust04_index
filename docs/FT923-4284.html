			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Cashing in on a good relationship with the bank manager Many business owners no doubt imagined that the worst would be over by now but still find themselves mired in the recession. Tight financial controls and good relations with the bank manager are more than ever important for survival, writes Charles Batchelor. A 10-point plan of corporate survival has been devised by Business Banking Review (BBR)*, a specialist consultancy. Make sure that the way you present financial information to the bank is of a high standard. It is no longer adequate to provide the numbers on the back of a cigarette packet. Keep your management accounting up to date so that you can raise funds quickly to take advantage of bargains created by the recession. BBR came across three companies which missed profitable opportunities because they could not provide the numbers to raise the money quickly enough. Forecast and monitor cash flow on a weekly or even daily basis. Check the terms and renewal dates of bank facilities and make sure that your bank's reporting requirements are being met. Plan carefully the negotiating position you will take at the next renewal meeting. Maximise cash flow by reducing stocks and keeping a tight control of debtors. Cut costs where possible and dispose of surplus assets. Review the profitability and cash generation capability of each part of your business. An activity may be making a profit but at the same time swallowing large amounts of cash. Maintain good communications with your bank manager. If there is bad news, make sure the bank knows but ensure you have a plan to put things right. Make sure you get a facility letter from your bank to cover any financing you have arranged. Check its contents to see it matches what you have agreed verbally. Sign it and return it to your bank. One company borrowed Pounds 1m from its bank to finance the purchase of a factory site over 20 years but signed a facility letter which allowed the bank to force repayment 'on demand'. Since the land could not be sold at short notice it had effectively given the bank control of its business. If necessary seek outside advice. New structures, facilities or institutions can often solve apparently impossible problems. Broaden the range of financial products and sources of finance you use. Businesses frequently make use of only a limited number of the available financing options. *Gota House, 70-74 Cannon Street, London EC4N 6AE. Tel 071 528 8530.</p>

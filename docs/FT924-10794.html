			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / International Capital Markets: Sakura Bank to cut staff by 10% SAKURA Bank, a leading Japanese commercial bank, plans to reduce its staff by more than 10 per cent over the next three years as part of a streamlining programme to boost long-term profitability. The bank will also close or consolidate about 50 of its 620 branches, cut advertising costs by 20 per cent and trim directors' salaries by 10 per cent under the three-year programme, which was applauded by the Ministry of Finance. Japanese banks are generally attempting to streamline after excesses of the late 1980s, but the task has been more difficult for Sakura, formerly Mitsui Taiyo Kobe Bank, which was formed in 1990 after a merger between Mitsui Bank and Taiyo Kobe Bank. Sakura said that it would not resort to sackings to cut the number of employees from 23,000 to 20,000, but would sharply reduce the annual graduate intake in the spring and would not replace staff who leave. The ministry has urged the banking industry to increase profitability to cope with the rising total of non-performing loans arising from the late 1980s. The ministry is expected to announce shortly a new figure of around Y12,000bn (Dollars 98bn) for the industry's non-performing loans, up from the Y8,000bn at the end of March. Japanese banks are in the final stages of drafting a proposal to establish a company to purchase non-performing loans and land collateral from afflicted banks in an attempt to reduce the bad debt burden and stimulate the property market. The banks, conscious of widespread opposition to the use of public funds to support the new company, say they are not seeking special tax concessions for the write-off of these loans, although they have negotiated with the finance ministry about such concessions. Hokuriku Bank, a leading regional institution, also announced a streamlining plan yesterday which includes a 10 per cent cut in its workforce of 4,500 by fiscal 1995 and a sharp reduction in new spending on computer systems. The bank, like most others, has been entangled in the collapse of various speculators, including Nanatomi, the stock and property group, which collapsed early last year owing about Y300bn.</p>

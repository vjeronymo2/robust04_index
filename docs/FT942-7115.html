			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / International Company News: Euris gets go-ahead to take stake in Moulinex Moulinex, the ailing French household appliances group, yesterday took a step towards completing its financial restructuring when its shareholders voted to allow Euris, an investment consortium, to take a stake in the company. The shareholders, who are dominated by Moulinex's employees and founders, were presented with offers from two prospective shareholders - Euris, a group of French investors led by Mr Jean-Charles Naouri, a financier, and Glen Dimplex, an Irish business which is one of Moulinex's closest competitors with the Morphy Richards brand. Euris had long been the favourite. Moulinex's workforce voiced concern earlier this year at a stake being sold to Glen Dimplex, on the grounds that it could lead to redundancies. However, last Tuesday shareholders postponed the meeting at which they were scheduled to vote on the two offers. Despite this delay the Euris bid carried the day when the shareholders eventually met yesterday afternoon. Moulinex now intends to finalise a FFr1bn rights issue. Moulinex warned earlier this week that its losses had deepened in its last financial year to March 31. Moulinex then sustained a net deficit of around FFr550m (including provisions of FFr500m) against a net loss of FFr115m on FFr8.22bn (Dollars 1.43bn) sales in the previous year.</p>

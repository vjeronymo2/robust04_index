			<p>BFN     [Text] Tbilisi, April 1 (SNARK) -- Today Abkhazian forces  managed to capture Lata, a settlement in the Kodor Canyon. The  sides were combating for it with variable success during over a  week. Thus, Abkhazian forces got a real chance to take under  their control all the Kodor Canyon, which is the last territory  in Abkhazia under Georgian control.    Georgian authorities undertake emergency measures to  evacuate  the population by helicopters from the Canyon.    Jaba Ioseliani, Head of the Georgian Emergency Committee,  told SNARK the situation is extremely strained in the Kodor  Canyon. "Georgian volunteers are struggling against regular  Abkhazian forces, armed to the teeth". The peaceful negotiation  he was coordinating failed. Nevertheless, the dialog should be  continued, said Mr. Ioseliani.</p>

Mr. Mahfoud Nahnah, head of the movement, expressed his  hopes  in an interview published today in L'OPINION that the date of  that conference would not be postponed.    On the project of the national consensus platform drawn up  by  the National Dialogue Commission, Mr. Mahfoud Nahnah said it  contained a number of proposals put forward by parties involved  in the dialogue. He stressed that, on the whole, there seemed to  be an acceptable consensus even if it remained limited.    The head of HAMAS reiterated his call to include  representatives from the dissolved Islamic Salvation Front [FIS]  and said he considered the success of the national conference to  be linked to the participation of the largest possible number of  tendencies.    On the other hand, the National Constitutional Rally  announced its continued participation in the next rounds of  dialogue attended by all sides. The National Constitutional  Rally, which is a coalition of 12 political parties, expressed  in a statement the necessity of adopting dialogue as a means and  method to contain the political crisis.    The rally stressed its determination to continue dialogue  with the National Dialogue Commission to reach a consensus on  the concord platform, and to exert all efforts to find safe ways  to resolve and to contain the political crisis in the presence  of all sides in the dialogue without marginalization, exclusion,  outbidding, or imposed leadership.</p>

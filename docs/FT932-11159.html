			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (America): OTC issues up on demand for cable TV Wall Street US EQUITY markets were mixed yesterday, with blue chip stocks little changed but over-the-counter issues rising sharply amid heavy demand for cable television and technology shares, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended a slight 0.27 off at 3,446.19. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 1.59 firmer at 444.05, while the Nasdaq composite strengthened 11.45 to 678.16. Trading volume on the New York SE amounted to 265m shares, and rises led declines by about two-to-one. The latest set of economic data failed to move the markets, although once again the news was not good, with the leading economic indicators down 1.0 per cent in March. The decline was bigger than forecast, and was the largest monthly drop in almost 2 1/2 years. On Monday the equity markets drew strength from a rally in the bond market that was triggered by bad economic news. Yesterday, however, another bond rally - the benchmark 30-year bond firmed almost   3/4 , lowering the yield to 6.785 per cent - failed to lift stocks. Investors remain worried that lower bond yields are the only thing supporting share prices. If yields were to reverse course, the equity markets could face a substantial sell-off. Among individual stocks, cable television companies were in demand on hopes that new regulations due to be imposed on the industry by the government will turn out to be less onerous than originally feared. On the NYSE, the biggest beneficiary was Time Warner, which rose Dollars 3 1/2 to Dollars 36 3/8 in volume of 3.3m shares, and was additionally buoyed by rumours that Mr Warren Buffett, the billionaire investor, had bought a 5 per cent stake in the company. On the American Stock Exchange, Cablevision jumped Dollars 3 5/8 to Dollars 33 1/4 . OTC cable television stocks, traded on the Nasdaq market, were also up sharply. Comcast advanced Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 20 5/8 , TCI Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 21 1/2 and TCA Cable Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 23 1/4 . The 'E' class stock of General Motors, which represents the car group's Electronic Data Systems subsidiary, fell Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 30 3/8 in volume of 2.2m shares on news that the company's talks with UK telecommunications group BT about a possible business alliance had broken down. Readers' Digest plunged Dollars 6, or 13 per cent, to Dollars 40 1/2 in heavy trading on reporting disappointing first-quarter earnings. Morgan Stanley, the securities house, followed the news by downgrading its rating on the stock from a 'buy' to a 'hold'. On the Nasdaq, Intel forged ahead Dollars 4 3/8 to Dollars 101 3/8 and Microsoft climbed Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 88 after the two companies unveiled a new phone standard for personal computers. Canada TORONTO closed little changed after active trading. The TSE 300 index firmed 5.7 to 3,779.2 but declines outscored advances by 347 to 340 after volume of 56.4m shares. Nine of the 14 stock groups closed higher, led by consumer products, up 0.8 per cent. The real estate group had the day's biggest decline, 1.1 per cent. The financial services and golds sectors also finished easier.</p>

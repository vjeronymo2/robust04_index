			<p>In     an apparent effort to demonstrate that Japan is advancing  toward full compliance with GATT rules, Japan's Ministry of  International Trade and Industry (MITI) is reportedly moving away  from bilateral voluntary export restraints on textiles and toward  adoption of more fixed textile import restrictions based on the  Multilateral Fiber Agreement.  According to the 17 February Nihon  Keizai Shimbun, MITI is currently formulating the criteria it  plans to use to justify restrictions on future textile imports  from China, Pakistan, and Taiwan as early as May 1994.  MITI is  also reportedly planning for the first time to apply dumping  duties consistent with GATT rules to textile products and is,  according to the 18 February Mainichi Shimbun, investigating the  alleged dumping of Pakistani cotton yarn based on a complaint  filed by the Japan Spinners' Association in December 1993.      MITI is also reportedly considering whether to move away from  voluntary export restraints in other sectors, such as automobiles  and forklifts, where Japan has agreed to limit its own exports.  According to the 21 January Asahi Shimbun, MITI is officially  maintaining that it has not decided whether the current voluntary  restraints for car exports to the United States will be renewed.  However, it reportedly wants to abolish such restraints,  calculating that now, when Japanese car exports to the United  States are down, would be a good time to abolish the voluntary  export restraints for automobiles.

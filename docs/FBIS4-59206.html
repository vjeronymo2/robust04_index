			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Discussion between political correspondents Udi Segal, </F> outside the Prime Minister's Office, and 'Adi Talmor, in the  studio -- live]    [Text] [Segal] A very brief cabinet session, which  started at 0900, ended a short time ago. This session was  convened to ratify the Gaza-Jericho agreement, and the agreement  was indeed unanimously ratified. The results of the Histadrut  elections obviously hovered in the air, but political affairs  were the main issue on the agenda. Minister Yosi Sarid told us  that even more significant than the ratification of the  agreement was the determination of a timetable for the transfer  of powers. The target date is next Wednesday [18 May]; by then  all the Gaza and Jericho autonomy areas will be transferred to  Palestinian authority.    [Talmor] Am I correct in saying that by that date all the  Palestinian police forces will have entered the area and the  Palestinians will be in charge of all the powers and buildings  in the area?    [Segal] More than that. By next Wednesday the PLO will bear  full responsibility in Gaza and Jericho. This is what Minister  Yosi Sarid told us several minutes ago:    [Begin Sarid recording] The cabinet ratified the agreement  unanimously. We should pay attention, however, to the  timetable, because now it is very specific: by Friday, two days  from now, the Palestinians will take over the southern part of  the Gaza Strip and all of Jericho. By next Wednesday the  Palestinians will take over the entire Gaza Strip, that is, Gaza  city itself and the northern part of the Gaza Strip as well.  This means that by next Wednesday the Palestinians will be in  charge of the Gaza Strip and Jericho, as stipulated by the  agreement. The actual testing of the agreement will start at  that time. [end recording]    [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0800 GMT on 11 May,  reporting on the cabinet session, adds the following: "Minister  Shim'on Shetrit said in the session that the agreement signed  with the PLO deviates from the Declaration of Principles. He  cited several examples, such as the granting of passports to the  Palestinians, the ability to legislate basic laws, radio  frequencies, dialing zones, etc."]</p>

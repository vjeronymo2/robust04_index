			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Exceptional helps lift CE Heath to Pounds 14.9m CE HEATH, the insurance broker, yesterday reported a jump in pre-tax profits from Pounds 4.19m to Pounds 14.9m for the six months to September 30. Exceptional items accounted for Pounds 7.96m of the improvement - a credit of Pounds 3.25m contrasting with a loss of Pounds 4.71m last time - but rising insurance rates and the strength of the US and Australian dollars helped boost brokerage profits by 59 per cent to Pounds 5.8m. Earnings per share amounted to 9p against losses of 0.2p. Before exceptional items, earnings rose by 43 per cent to 10.9p. The interim dividend is unchanged at 5p. 'Underpinning these results has been the rigorous expense control exercise commenced earlier this year,' said Mr Michael Kier, chairman. Brokerage turnover rose 11 per cent to Pounds 56.6m and by 3 per cent in underlying terms. Expenses rose by less than 1 per cent and investment income fell by 27 per cent on underlying trends. Some Pounds 2.7m of the higher turnover was due to currency factors. Underwriting profits, which stem from Heath's minority stake in HIH, the Australian insurer, increased to Pounds 4.8m (Pounds 4.2m). Heath reduced its stake to 25 per cent in August with the profit from the sale producing an exceptional item of Pounds 3.25m. The run-off at CE Heath Underwriting &amp; Insurance produced a loss of Pounds 800,000. Computer services performed well with pre-tax profits increasing to Pounds 2.1m, compared with Pounds 1.7m. Peterborough Software produced profits of Pounds 1.7m on turnover of Pounds 14.3m. COMMENT Heath is making positive progress in increasing brokerage revenues and reducing expenses and the group looks set to produce pre-tax profits of at least Pounds 30m for the full year. That would put the share on a prospective multiple of more than 17, which looks reasonable for the sector. Despite yesterday's positive exceptional item, the markets have become accustomed to unwelcome surprises on that front recently, this year's provisions against Australian aviation reinsurance losses being the latest example. Investors may need a little bit more time to be convinced that there is no more bad news in store, a fact which probably explains yesterday's unenthusiastic response from the markets with the shares closing unchanged at 399p.</p>

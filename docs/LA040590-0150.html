			<p><P> April 5, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOVIETS PLAN TO 'CLEANSE' PARTY OF RADICALS  </P> <P> The Soviet Communist Party, faced with growing divisions in its ranks, is  preparing to oust those radical reformers who promote "social democracy" rather  than the party's platform, informed political sources said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Intended as a major "cleansing" of the party, the move will attempt to preempt  the plans of some radicals to break away when the party holds a pivotal  congress in July by expelling them and re-establishing political discipline  among remaining party members.  </P> <P> The campaign is expected to begin within a few days, according to the sources,  following the publication of a "letter to Communists" from the top party  leadership outlining the need to tighten party discipline and to adhere to a  basic ideology.  </P> <P> The letter will also stress, the sources said, that the drive must be conducted  within party rules and on the basis of the new platform, that it must be  focused on individuals rather than on groups and that, above all, it must not  degenerate into a full-scale purge, a word at which all here shudder.  </P> <P> "No one plans to oust people by platforms or groups," one party source  commented. "Each party member will be invited to define his position and make a  decision as regards party membership. Each individual party member will have to  determine what his position will be."  </P> <P> In seeking to eliminate the voices of those reformers demanding far more  radical changes, the campaign seems certain to make the 18.8-million-member  party much more homogenous, forcing out those on the extreme left and perhaps  those on the extreme right.  </P> <P> The most likely targets for the campaign, the sources said, are the more than  60,000 members of the party's Democratic Platform, a newly formed faction that  believes that "Communist ideology has exhausted itself" and that is pressing  for more radical reforms.  </P> <P> The group, which has 162 local clubs in 102 Soviet cities, has been debating  whether, when and how to break with the Communist Party and establish itself as  a social democratic party. The new party would be oriented toward evolutionary  changes to establish socialism, retaining a market-based economy but with  protection for the underprivileged.  </P> <P> Arkady M. Murashov, a leader of the opposition Inter-Regional Group of Deputies  in the Soviet Parliament, said organizers of a proposed social democratic party  have planned a founding conference for May and that the Communist Party is "in  a race on who acts first."  </P> <P> While some Communist Party members have already resigned to join the social  democrats, Murashov predicted that there would be mass resignations once the  new party is founded. "We expect at least half of the members to follow our  example," he said. "In any case, we are talking about millions joining the new  party -- instantly and on the spot."  </P> <P> But the campaign would probably leave untouched the Soviet Union's most popular  opposition politician, populist Boris N. Yeltsin, who remains a member of the  Communist Party's policy-making Central Committee. Despite his open and sharp  criticism of many party policies and of the its leadership, Yeltsin has stopped  well short of forming a faction within the party, let alone a new party,  relying instead on his immense personal appeal.  </P> <P> The anticipated campaign appears to have resulted from a fundamental  understanding, reached within the past week, between progressives and  conservatives in the party's ruling Politburo, and this may ultimately prove  more important than the campaign itself.  </P> <P> Conservatives seem to have accepted in this agreement the far-reaching reforms  sought by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to transform the Soviet economy on the  basis of market forces. Progressives, for their part, have agreed on the need  to recognize the party's "merits" and not blame it for all the country's ills;  they also seem to accept the necessity of greater party discipline, even at the  cost of ousting some past allies.  </P> <P> This understanding, if confirmed, would resolve some of the deepest divisions  within the Soviet leadership over the course of perestroika, as Gorbachev's  program of political, economic and social reforms is known.  </P> <P> Gorbachev is now pushing a package of more than 20 measures to overhaul the  Soviet economy, with some of the first to be adopted about May 1 and others to  come into effect over the summer and autumn.  </P> <P> Prominent conservatives, who have long insisted on the need to keep the Soviet  economy within the framework of central planning and based on state ownership,  are already talking with equanimity about the transition to "market conditions"  while retaining elements of the old system.  </P> <P> Much of the government and party bureaucracy remains in the hands of  conservative apparatchiki, as do many state-owned enterprises, and their  support of the reforms, or at least their acquiescence in them, will be  crucial.  </P> <P> Progressives, who hold positions closer to the center, have begun to far more  freely criticize their one-time allies, the radicals, accusing them of losing  sight of the urgent need for a better economic performance if perestroika is to  succeed.  </P> <P> The campaign appears to follow closely the call last month of Yegor K.  Ligachev, a senior Politburo member regarded as the party's leading  conservative, who demanded that the policy-making Central Committee begin such  a "cleansing" and rid itself of radicals who distort its policies and undermine  its discipline.  </P> <P> Although a liberal party source denied that Ligachev and his supporters within  the Central Committee had forced others in the leadership to accept the  campaign, he does appear the winner in what must have been a major showdown  within the party's top ranks.  </P> <P> The campaign is certain to hit such well-known radicals as historian Yuri N.  Afanasyev, a leader of the Inter-Regional Group of Deputies, according to  political sources here.  </P> <P> "These people are not Communists, and the process of evaluating each member  will make clear who is who and where everyone stands," one influential  conservative party source said. "This will be a cleansing of our ranks -- not a  purge, definitely not -- and we will emerge smaller but stronger as a party."  </P> <P> But the drive could also reach some prominent members of the new political  Establishment, including economist Stanislav S. Shatalin, a key adviser to  Gorbachev, who declared himself to be a social democrat during last month's  meeting of the Central Committee.  </P></p>

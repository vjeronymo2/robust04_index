			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets: Global sense of depression in thin trading With a 1.4 per cent fall in local currency terms last week, the FT-Actuaries World Index reflected a global sense of depression, thin trading, and traders and investors unwilling to take risks, heightened by the low volume of business. The biggest influence on the World Index was Japan, which is also the worst performer of the year so far with a drop of 30.7 per cent; early in the week Tokyo shrugged off the Japanese government's plans to acquire land worth Y3 to Y4 trillion in a bid to rescue the banks, and on Wednesday to Friday sentiment was abraded by three consecutive falls in Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone (NTT), leaving Japan's most widely-held share down 13.6 per cent on the week. In Europe, Norway invited comparison with Japan on a twelve month basis, 32.9 per cent in arrears. Oslo was also the worst performing market of the week. Mr David Longmuir of James Capel says that the latest fall reflected a mix of profound depression among domestic investors, and lack of foreign involvement for the time being; the roots of that were in the weak dollar, and its effect on the oil price and shipping rates. Austria ran Norway a close second on the downgrade. Once again, there was a sense of a relatively marginal equity market losing its occasional foreign support, and getting heavily oversold at domestic level. The market was unsettled further last Friday with the introduction of stock index futures and options trading on its ATX marker. Italy rose after an agreement between the government, trade unions and employers to scrap wage indexation, but the technical recovery there had subsided by the end of the week. Back in the Pacific Basin, Singapore joined the laggards. A review from Hoare Govett Asia last Friday said that gloom and despondency had overwhelmed the market, and that poor results from the shipping sector had weakened sentiment across the board.</p>

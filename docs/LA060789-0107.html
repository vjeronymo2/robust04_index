			<p><P> June 7, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NBA CHAMPIONSHIP SERIES;  </P> <P> WORTHY'S MISSES MAKE THE PISTONS' NIGHT  </P> <P> Laker forward James Worthy launched a baseline jumper a minute into the opening  game of the NBA Finals against the Detroit Pistons.  </P> <P> It was an airball, and an indication of what lay ahead for Worthy.  </P> <P> Worthy missed his first five field-goal attempts before he finally sank a shot  with 3 1/2 minutes remaining in the first period.  </P> <P> "Anytime James Worthy misses his first five shots you know it's going to be a  long night," said Laker Mychal Thompson.  </P> <P> And it was a very long night for the Lakers.  </P> <P> "James Worthy had a rough start," Coach Pat Riley said. "I think he put too  much pressure on himself. But he's been very good in the playoffs and he'll  come back."  </P> <P> A model of consistency throughout his career, Worthy was dreadful in the  Lakers' 109-97 loss to the Pistons.  </P> <P> Worthy, who had shot 60.3% going into the game, made just six of 18 shots  (33%). He had been averaging 24.3 points before Tuesday but scored only 17 in  Game 1.  </P> <P> What happened?  </P> <P> "I got good shots," Worthy said. "I was trying to rush them. I've just got to  relax. Things like this happen. You can't dwell on shots being missed. The  shots I missed tonight are going to fall."  </P> <P> Worthy took a big fall early in the game when Piston forward Rick Mahorn  knocked him down on a drive to the basket. As a matter of fact, Mahorn's  aggressive defense took Worthy out of the Laker offense all night.  </P> <P> Mahorn forced Worthy, who normally sets up under the basket on the right side,  to move farther away from the basket.  </P> <P> "Mahorn played James very physically early in the game," said Bill Bertka,  Laker assistant coach. "Mahorn took away James' favorite spot in the low block  on the right side."  </P> <P> Mahorn, however, refused to take all the credit for stopping Worthy.  </P> <P> "I had a lot of help from my teammates," Mahorn said. "I can't stop him by  myself. I needed help."  </P> <P> Mahorn got it from John Salley and Dennis Rodman.  </P> <P> "Rick did a tremendous job on Worthy in the first half," Rodman said. "He kept  him out of the box down low. He took Worthy out of his rhythm. But Worthy is a  great player."  </P> <P> Worthy demonstrated that last year by getting 36 points, 16 rebounds and 10  assists against the Pistons in Game 7 of the 1988 NBA Finals. Worthy was named  MVP of the series.  </P> <P> But Mahorn, hampered by a back injury, watched Worthy destroy the Pistons while  lying on his stomach on the sidelines. Mahorn had been lying in wait for a  year, and Tuesday played relentless defense on Worthy.  </P> <P> "They had Mahorn pushing James around," Thompson said. "But James just didn't  make his shots. He'll probably take the same shots and made six or seven in a  row the next game."  </P> <P> The absence of guard Byron Scott, who missed the game with a partially torn  left hamstring, severely hampered Worthy's effectiveness. It allowed the  Pistons to double-team Worthy more often.  </P> <P> "They played good defense, but when you don't have Byron, we have just two  scorers, me and James," Laker guard Magic Johnson said. "And they can  double-team us more."  </P> <P> Said Worthy: "You always expect double-teaming. And it wasn't any different  tonight. You can't dwell on it."  </P> <P> But the Pistons think Worthy can recover.  </P> <P> "We can't say that we stopped James Worthy," Mark Aguirre said. "Everyone has a  tough night. And I know that James Worthy is going to try to come back even  stronger."  </P> <P> Said Piston Coach Chuck Daly: "I don't know if you can ever stop a guy like  Worthy. You just work hard and hope he doesn't hit his shots."  </P> <P> </P> <P> UN-WORTHYLIKE  </P> <P> A look at the statistics of Laker forward James Worthy in Game 1 of the NBA  championship series and his previous 11 playoff games.  </P> <P> GAME 1, CHAMPIONSHIP SERIES  </P> <TABLE CWL="1.56IN:1.89IN:1.56IN:1.89IN:1.56IN:1.45IN:1.45IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="7"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> MIN.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> FGA-FGM  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> PCT.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> FTA-FTM  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> PCT.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> REB  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> PTS  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 39  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 6-18  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> .333  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 5-8  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> .625  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 2  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 17  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P> <P> </P> <P> PREVIOUS 11 PLAYOFF GAMES  </P> <TABLE CWL="1.45IN:1.89IN:1.56IN:1.89IN:1.56IN:1.45IN:1.56IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="7"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> MPG  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> FGA-FGM  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> .PCT  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> FTA-FTM  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> PCT.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> RPG  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> PPG  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 39  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 114-189  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> .603  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 41-49  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> .837  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 7.6  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 24.3  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE></p>

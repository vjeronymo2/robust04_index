			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Mario Nobilo, the permanent representative of the  Republic of Croatia in the United Nations has sent a letter to  the Security Council [UNSC] chairman. The letter refers to the  claims presented to the UNSC chairman by UN Secretary-General  Butrus-Ghali in his letter dated 1 February. We will broadcast  Nobilo's letter in its entirety.    My government does not deny that regular Croatian forces are  deployed in the border areas between Croatia and  Bosnia-Herzegovina. They have been deployed there in accordance  with the joint agreement between my government and the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Government of 12 July 1992. The redeployment  of those forces would put in serious jeopardy the territorial  integrity and security of the Republic of Croatia. Considering  the defense of towns on Croatia's Dalmatian coast, such a change  in the balance of power in relation to the Serb side would put  in serious jeopardy the support for the [Croatian] president's  peace initiative, which is currently being discussed in the  assembly, aiming at normalizing relations with Sarajevo and  Belgrade.    My government cannot accept the simplified interpretation of  the joint declaration with Belgrade of 19 January 1994 that the  declaration is directed against the side that did not sign it  [the Muslim side]. In fact, my president [Tudjman] proposed to  the prime ministers of Turkey and Pakistan to mediate in the  negotiations between the Croatian and Bosnian Muslim sides -- as  the Croatian side proposed in Bonn -- before all sides resume  their negotiations in Geneva scheduled for 10 February.    The Security Council will conclude that the joint statement  by my government and Belgrade is fully in line with Security  Council Resolution 871 from 1993, the CSCE final documents from  Rome, and the EU's modus vivendi action plan of 22 November  1993, Nobilo said in his letter and added:    My government remains concerned for the well-being of the  Croats, citizens of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, who are  besieged by the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army in Vitez, Kiseljak,  Usora, Zepce, and elsewhere. We have warned the Security  Council on several occasions that the ethnic Croats, citizens of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, should be treated in the same way as the  Muslims who are besieged in Srebrenica, Zepa, Gorazde, Sarajevo,  Tuzla, and Bihac. The enclaves of Vitez, Kiseljak, Usora, and  Zepce should be proclaimed protected areas in line with  principles of Resolution 824 from 1993.    On 2 December 1993 and 24 January 1994, my government called  on the Security Council to review the problem of large-scale  violations of international humanitarian law committed by the  [Bosnian] government forces, against Croats, citizens of  Bosnia-Herzegovina. Forces of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army have  carried out at least eight mass executions of Croats, citizens  of Bosnia-Herzegovina, since July last year.    Under such circumstances, when the Security Council has no  means of protecting Croats, citizens of Bosnia-Herzegovina, my  government has no moral right to prevent Croat volunteers from  helping the threatened community of Croats in Bosnia, who  account for 18 percent of the Bosnia-Herzegovina population and  have been forced into 10 percent of the territory. My  government believes that a military solution to the problem of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, or the problem of the UN protected areas in  Croatia, is not acceptable, and in this respect it will continue  supporting international mediation. We lend special support to  international mechanisms supervising the number, presence, and  intentions of the Croatian Army and Croatian volunteers in the  territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina. In this context, I would like  to repeat the Croatian president's invitation to the Security  Council of 16 July 1993 to supervise the Croatian and  Bosnia-Herzegovina borders. Croatia will immediately give its  support to such a mechanism.    If the Security Council is ready to suggest a better  solution  to the crisis in the area, than the one offered by the  international conference on the former Yugoslavia, my government  is ready to review their proposal. However, my government would  like to warn the Security Council that any serious change in the  balance of power in the area would derail the current process.  In this respect, my government calls on the Security Council to  give its full and unconditional support to the international  conference on the former Yugoslavia, and especially to the  Owen-Stoltenberg peace plan on Bosnia-Herzegovina, and to tell  all interested parties that this is the only possible way to end  the difficult human tragedy in the area.    This is said in the letter by Mario Nobilo, permanent  representatives of the Republic of Croatia in the United Nations.</p>

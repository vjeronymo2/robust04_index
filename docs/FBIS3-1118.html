General Viljoen  told the Pretoria Press Club that his party wanted to complete  all the details for an Afrikaner volkstaat before the election  and to define the self- determination aspect of the Afrikaner as  soon as possible. However, he said that proof of support for a  volkstaat was of cardinal importance and could only be done by  voting in next month's election. According to General Viljoen,  the establishment of a volkstaat cannot be stopped if there are  more than a million votes in its favor. However, it would be up  to the constitutional court to decide whether there was  sufficient support.</p>

			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / SIB proposes fresh rules on client funds EXTENSIVE changes to rules covering how investment firms handle clients' money were proposed yesterday by the Securities and Investments Board, the chief investment regulator. The board did not suggest significant changes of principle in spite of concern expressed after the collapse of British &amp; Commonwealth Holdings, the financial services group that went into administration last year. The proposed changes were prompted by the experience of operating the existing rules during the past three years and by difficulties that arose when investment firms collapsed, SIB said. The changes, on which comments should be made by June 28, include: If clients of an investment firm specify a bank where they want their cash to be held, the money will not be 'pooled' with that of other investors if another bank used by the same investment firm collapses. SIB decided not to change its rule on pooling in other cases. That rule, under which all investors get back the same share of their investments if a firm fails, is the fairest and most cost-effective way of handling such cases, it said. Investment firms will have to warn clients if at any time in the future they might put money into a bank owned by the group to which the firm belongs. That is a partial response to the B&amp;C case, where investment firms within the group deposited money in a sister bank, British &amp; Commonwealth Merchant Bank. Firms will have to notify professional investors if their money is not held separately from the firms' own funds. That is a response to the failure of Drexel Burnham Lambert, the US investment bank, where it emerged that some professional investors had not realised that their funds were intermingled with those of the firm rather than being held in segregated accounts. Many other changes are designed to simplify procedures for investment firms. For example, firms will no longer have to pay interest to a client if they invest the client's money within 10 days of receiving it. Proposals for Amended Client Money Regulations.

			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Algeria to sign exploration deals ALGERIA IS on the verge of signing a fresh batch of oil and gas exploration agreements, according Mr Nordine Ait Laoussine, the oil minister, who said the government is discussing new ventures with six foreign companies. Speaking after last week's Opec meeting, Mr Ait Laoussine said: 'We will be able to announce very shortly several exploration agreements'. The oil minister said Algeria's ambitious oil and gas expansion plans, accelerated late last year by law changes to encourage foreign investment, could entail investment worth Dollars 20bn by the end of the century in a drive to boost output to meet European demand. Mr Ait Laoussine also said Algeria would open a bidding process for up to 12 new oil concessions in July. He added that, if should talks with some of the six companies currently involved in negotiations - including US, European and Japanese groups - were not be concluded by then, he might include blocs in the next round. He hoped to offer fresh territory for bidding every six months. 'We would like to cover all the sedimentary areas with bidders,' he said. The country - which is also a leading producer of gas, liquified natural gas and condensates - hopes to raise output from some 1.8m b/d of oil equivalent to some 2.5m b/d by the turn of the century. Mr Ait Laoussine said Algeria had signed contracts to export almost 60bn cubic metres of natural gas a year - the most the country can comfortably sustain, he explained - and was expanding facilities to meet that target. With reserves of 3 trillion (million million) cu m of gas, the minister said recently that Algeria hoped to become Europe's major gas supplier over the next decade. In Vienna he pointed out that Algeria needed to explore gas fields in the country's south which, he said, had been largely neglected. On oil, Mr Ait Laoussine said there was a 'definite need to increase the exploration effort' in Algeria, which at present pumps 770,000 barrels a day. Official studies estimate that Algeria faces a decline in sustainable output to between 500,000 and 300,000 b/d by early next century without new oil finds. Algeria presently has just over 9bn barrels of exploitable reserves. The government late last year substantially revised its foreign investment laws in the hope of attracting foreign capital into its hitherto protected oil sector. The changes permitted output sharing agreements, improved exploration terms and cut tax and royalty rates. Atlantic Richfield (Arco) this month became the first foreign company since the law changes to sign contracts with Sonatrach, the state oil company, to explore for oil and gas.</p>

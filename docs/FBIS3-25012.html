			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Two emissaries from the Beninese Government  arrived in Lome this morning. They are Desire Vieyra, minister  of state in charge of national defense, and Alabi Antoine  Gbegan, minister of interior, public security, and territorial  administration. The delegation was welcomed at the Benin-Togo  Hila Kondji border by Combevi Georges Agbodjan, minister of  territorial administration and security, in the presence of the  permanent undersecretary to the president of the Republic, and  Colonel (Sezin Walla), commander of the National Gendarmerie.    Soon after arriving in our capital the delegation was  received in audience by General Gnassingbe Eyadema in Lome, Ward  2. After the audience, Mr. Vieyra, leader of the delegation,  told newsmen that he was dispatched by Beninese President  Nicephore Soglo to meet his Togolese counterpart for discussions  on security problems between the two states, particularly the  kidnapping of a Beninese subprefect by an armed gang. According  to the Beninese Government, the kidnappers and the hostage took  refuge in Togo. Let us listen to Mr. Vieyra:    [Begin recording] [Vieyra] President Nicephore Soglo  dispatched me to his friend and brother, President Gnassingbe  Eyadema, to first discuss problems concerning our two countries,  mainly security problems. As you know, there was an incident on  our territory recently. An armed gang which, we think, was led  by a fugitive soldier, kidnapped a subprefect and is holding him  hostage. According to the information we have, we believe that  they took refuge in Togolese territory. We have therefore been  dispatched by President Nicephore Soglo to seek President  Eyadema's assistance so that those bandits can be quickly found  and the subprefect in question can be handed over safely to the  Beninese authorities.    We found in Gen. Eyadema all the necessary support,  understanding, and availability that we were expecting of him,  and we are returning confident that searches will continue and  the matter will be settled. This affair should not be an  obstacle to the friendly and fraternal relations that have  always existed between Benin and Togo.    [Unidentified reporter] Is it confirmed that the kidnappers  and the subprefect are on Togolese territory?    [Vieyra] In such cases, nobody can confirm anything, but  according to our information we know that they crossed the  Togolese border. Are they still on Togolese territory? We are  not in a position to confirm that. [passage omitted] [end  recording]</p>

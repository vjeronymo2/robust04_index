			<p><P> August 18, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GALLERIES: SANTA MONICA  </P> <P> "Loaded" is a group show with a big, slippery theme: "The placement of the body  in social, psychological, theoretical and aestheticized ways." It takes a while  to figure out how these ideas apply to each of the disparate objects in the  show, but having the theme as a guide proves helpful in coming to grips with  some of the odder pieces.  </P> <P> Fred Fehlau's "Blinder" pieces have to do with the mind's ability to piece  together bits of information discovered by moving both the eyes as well as the  entire body. Millie Wilson's multipart paintings of newspaper pages seem to be  about editorial judgments pertaining to the size and placement of photographs  that get in the paper.  </P> <P> Marc Romano's discreetly bulging, plaster fig-leaf painting blends with the  color of the wall -- a wry allusion to the supposed invisibility, in polite  society, of the male sex organ. Michael Tidmus' "Next," a piece one reads from  the implacable screen of a MacIntosh computer, presents fiction and fact about  AIDS. Mark Niblock's intensely evocative text-cum-photograph moves the reader  into a fanciful dream with a bitter edge about AIDS and death.  </P> <P> Sarah Seager's large, narrow suitcases stacked on top of each other suggest an  irresolute body -- at once in flight and at rest, and determined to take up as  little space as possible. In "Plank Piece," Charles Ray photographs a body  punishing itself: a man who hangs from his stomach and from his knees on a  plank wedged against the wall.  </P> <P> Peter Seidler's bizarre arrangements of lead-enclosed shapes resemble office  furniture and machines both recognizable and mysterious. They come in different  sizes -- "normal" and miniature -- suggesting a bizarre "other dimension." Yves  Klein's "Blue Venus" -- the familiar armless torso painted in the artist's  special shade of electric blue -- makes the impudent claim that an artist can  re-create a famous sculpture simply by recoloring it.  </P> <P> Other work is by Maria Lonner, Martha Godfrey, Doug Hammett, Belinda Raczka,  Tim Ebner, Nayland Blake and Allan McCollum. (Richard Kuhlenschmidt Gallery,  1634 17th St., until Saturday.) CATHY CURTIS  </P></p>

			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / South Korea cashes in on overseas investors South Korean financial institutions cashed in yesterday as overseas investors responded to the raising of foreign shareholding ceilings by buying their highest one-day total of shares in the country's leading blue-chip companies. Foreign investors purchased 19.4m shares, far higher than their daily average of 140,000, or the 270,000 shares purchased on the first day the market opened on January 13, 1992. However, the Seoul general index fell 8.2 points to 1066.21 as Korean institutional investors unloaded large numbers of stocks acquired in anticipation of the increase in the foreign investment limit to 12 from 10 per cent. Western securities houses in Seoul have claimed the government's announcement in early October that the foreign shareholding ceiling would be raised on December 1 had given some domestic investors plenty of time to raise share prices, some by up to 30 per cent. The move provided an opportunity for Korea's troubled financial institutions to reap large capital gains. Banks have been relying on income from securities to increase profits threatened by growing provisions for non-performing loans. Investment trust companies are also relying on big gains on the bourse to pay back government loans. Analysts in Seoul have been debating for weeks whether foreign investors would accept the higher prices for blue-chip shares or wait until the market stabilised. The answer came within minutes of yesterday's opening as the expanded foreign shareholding quota for some of the nation's most favoured stocks were quickly filled. Among stocks favoured were the bourse's star performer Korea Mobile Telecom, the electronics companies Samsung and Goldstar, Hyundai Motor, Hyundai Engineering and Construction, and Daewoo Securities. By the end of the day, the foreign ceiling for 58 of the most attractive issues had been reached. 'If foreign investors have been smart, they would have waited. But it was a question of too much foreign capital chasing too few stocks. Investors decided it would be better to be in them rather than be shut out and pay premiums later' on the unofficial over-the-counter market, a senior official at a British securities house said. South Korea is considered one of the most attractive markets in Asia because of its generally moderate price-to-earnings ratios and a booming economy, which is expected to grow by at least 8 per cent this year. Foreign investors have been preparing for the latest opening during the past few weeks by restructuring their portfolios, including selling less attractive shares. Analysts now expect a decline in the stock market as foreign investors bide their time in purchasing other stocks. Korean investors will have another chance to take advantage of overseas interest next year when the foreign shareholding limit is raised to 15 per cent.</p>

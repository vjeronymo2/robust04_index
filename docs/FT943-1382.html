			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / International Company News: Pounds 11m marine protein expansion by IAWS IAWS Group, the Dublin-based food and agricultural company, yesterday made a Pounds 11.2m recommended offer for a Scottish fishmeal and fish oil manufacturing company. Mr Philip Lynch, chief executive of IAWS, said the acquisition of United Fish Products would more than double IAWS's marine protein interests making it the leading producer of oil and marine protein in the UK as well as one of the four largest producers in the European Union. UFP has a processing plant in Aberdeen and manages processing companies in the Shetland Islands and Grimsby. IAWS is making the offer through a subsidiary, Braemar Fish Products, which is offering Pounds 26.50 for each share in cash or loan notes. In the year to September 30 1993 UFP's pre-tax profits rose 47 per cent to Pounds 737,000. Net assets at completion would total Pounds 8.7m. IAWS has acquired other fish oil and fishmeal businesses in the UK in recent years, including the fishmeal business of Nordos, an offshoot of British Petroleum. Mr Lynch said the acquisition would bring benefits of scale in technical sales and marketing as well as research and development in process and product areas.</p>

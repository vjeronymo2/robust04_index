			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / BR to introduce station nurseries COMMUTERS will soon be able to park their children as well as their cars at 10 stations on British Rail's Network SouthEast. Just over half the places at the nurseries, paid for by BR and local employers, will be reserved for BR staff, but they will also be open to passengers. The first two, at Oxford and Wimbledon - purpose-built at a combined cost of Pounds 500,000 - are likely to open in July and provide a total of 100 places. BR says many more such creches might open around the country if the scheme is successful. Network SouthEast hopes to open a further eight during the next school year. BR hopes the nurseries will help in retaining women workers, cut absenteeism and increase efficiency. The number of employer-sponsored nurseries has doubled to 425 since the 1990 Budget introduced tax incentives. The BR move comes after Midland Bank's decision to end its creche programme last year. The bank had planned to open 300 nurseries by 1993, but stopped at 130. Last year a survey showed that, of 34 companies that had been planning nursery provision in 1989, only seven had started to operate creches. The BR nurseries will be run by independent companies and based on US railway creches. The 10 nurseries will be spread throughout the south-east region, almost certainly at sites that will serve each of the nine divisions of Network SouthEast. An additional London-based nursery is likely.</p>

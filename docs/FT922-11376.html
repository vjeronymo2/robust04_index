			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Arts: Whose film is it anyway? - Screen THE PAST has always come to us neatly packaged. Give history enough time and it will reduce itself, as all schoolboys know, to a grab-bag of dates, political milestones and rhyming mnemonics ('Willy, Willy, Harry, Steve'). The remarkable thing about cinema history is that, unlike real history, it has been neat and simple: at least until now. 99 out of 100 films were made to a certain length and shown at that length. They had no life beyond the cinema, so there was no call for longer TV/video versions aimed at the mini-series market or shorter TV/video versions aimed at turning epics into teledramas. In addition, the studio era kept the director's ego on a leash, deterring him from crying 'Foul' if his film left the cutting-room minus his favourite scenes. Today all is different. Multiplying delivery systems and declarations of war by hard-done directors make the modern feature film the world's most frighteningly elastic work of art. When a film is not actually born in two distinct versions - as recently in Rivette's 4-hour La Belle Noiseuse twin-packed with a 2-hour 'Divertimento'  -it can have a delayed rebirth as that increasingly voguish phenomenon, the 'director's version'. Witness A Star Is Born (Cukor), Lawrence Of Arabia (Lean), Betty Blue (Beineix) and, soon to reach us, James Cameron's revised Aliens and Ridley Scott's revised Blade Runner. Scouring the cutting-room floor, auteurs collect the celluloid that they once had to excise at a producer's whim and stick it back in. Sometimes too, a director changes his own mind. Video allows him to push out a second version of his film without blaming anyone else for the first. The world is treated to, say, Steven Spielberg's Close Encounters Of The Third Kind: The Special Edition. Meanwhile, there are movies or movie-sagas expanded for TV serialisation (The Godfather), made-for-TV films that live a ghostly second life on the large screen (Broadway Bound) and films that cannot make up their minds at all whether they are features or teledramas or mini-series (Altman's Vincent And Theo). Even that notable modern mould-breaker Twin Peaks began life as a TV series pilot cum mini-feature cum video. No one has worked out what all this portends culturally, least of all the directors. German film-maker Wim Wenders denies that his 2 1/2 -hour sci-fi fable Until The End Of The World is a contractually enforced compromise version, but he admits to having a preferred five-hour version up his sleeve for later release. Further back in time, Michael Cimino's ill-fated Heaven's Gate fought for survival in three different versions, ranging from the director's cherished 4 1/2 -hour cut to a 90-minute TV quickie called The Johnson County War. Bygone film-makers such as DW Griffith, Abel Gance and Erich Von Stroheim all faced the curse of the scissors from censors or studios. But they, unlike their descendants, could seldom combat the finality of the release version. Today, TV and video allow a director a second or third bite at the cherry of artistic perfection. Result: a world at once saner and madder. The awareness of expanded options liberates the director. But it also allows him to bewilder audiences by treating his film as an almost 'work in progress'. This phrase has become a mantra of modern cinema. When two famous films were submitted to the Cannes Film Festival in different years as works-in-progress and won the Golden Palm - Apocalypse Now and The Mission - festival-goers rightly protested that they were being treated as sneak preview audiences. Either the film was ready to the director's satisfaction or it was not. If not, it should wait for another festival. But then the sneak preview itself has assumed a special role in the age of the flexi-film. Is a movie ready when the director says so? Or when the studio says so? Or when a guinea-pig audience says so after filling in its preview cards and demanding that, say, Glenn Close be horribly slaughtered in Fatal Attraction or that the ending of The Bonfire Of The Vanities be radically re-cut (see Julie Salomon's enthralling production chronicle The Devil's Candy)? Films are flexible today because so many paymasters call so many different tunes. Cinema has become the modern equivalent to oral storytelling. In the old days, the diverse responses of Tom, Dickon or Harry influenced the teller's tale so that it changed from one telling to the next. The storyteller with a high opinion of his art might protest, but the fluid nature of the audience patterned the fluidity of the work. Some cinephiles today would claim that that fluidity has always existed in film: that the finite nature even of past works of cinema is illusory. Scholars and restorers such as Britain's Kevin Brownlow (Napoleon) and America's Robert Harris (Lawrence Of Arabia) earn a living from regarding old movies too as being in a state of perpetual evolution. But even these men tend to have a guiding light to move towards: that inspirational concept of 'the director's intention'. We are fast entering an age, though, when this concept, too, is exposed as unsound. It supposes not only that the director had an intention - debatable in the hurly-burly of most film-making - but that the director is the highest reference point and authority. Is he? One could argue that the true author of a successful commercial film is the studio that first packaged the ingredients, or the star who lovingly nursed the project as his next career move, or the screenwriter who put pen to paper, or even the novelist whose best-seller made the film a going concern from the start. Cinema gets us into these confusions because it is a corporate art like cathedral-building, not a single-signature art like novel-writing or composing. In many ways, the proliferating confusions of the flexi-film do us a service by pointing out a truth long overdue: that, since movies emerge from a turmoil of creative minds, it is fair to reflect that in a turmoil of release versions and delivery systems. Equally, if film-making is increasingly shaped by the imagined or market-researched demands of the viewers who will pay for it, then new viewing contexts are justified in making their own new demands. If the screen's ravening appetite and ramifying digestive systems demand that a successful movie doubles as a mini-series or a pop promo or a sitcom, who is the director or anyone else to say nay? In years to come the 'definitive' version of a film could become as elusive or controversial as those rarer instances of protean identity in other arts: from Verdi's Don Carlos to Joyce's Ulysses. But unlike them, in the perversely polymorphous context of movie authorship, there is no artist-as-God-the-father looking down and advising from the heavens. A world where 'democratic' has become the most approved and talismanic word in the language has got the democratic art it silently called for but is struggling, not so silently, to understand it.</p>

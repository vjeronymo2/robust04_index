			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed HINA article: "Charge Without Evidence"] </F>   [Text] Zagreb -- The RH [Republic of Croatia] Supreme Court  announced on Tuesday that "at the request of the President of  the Republic, the RH Supreme Court has investigated and  established the legal situation concerning the statement by Mr.  Stipe Mesic: `There have been quite a few murders committed by  people who are not in prison, although their identity is  well-known. It is known who killed Reihl-Kir, Saban, Krivokuca  and the Zec family'" (FERAL TRIBUNE, No. 449, 25 April 1994).    The RH Supreme Court reports that in "connection with the  killing of the Zec family, criminal proceedings have been  completed, that criminal proceedings are underway in connection  with the murder of Reihl-Kir, and that so far criminal  proceedings have not been instituted in connection with the  murders of Saban and Krivokuca."    The news release of the RH Supreme Court states: ``The  verdict of the district court in Zagreb (now zupanija court in  Zagreb), as the court in the first instance, dated 9 July 1992  (VI-K-104/92-86), in its acquittal section, based on Article  350, Point 3, of the Law on Criminal Procedure (now Article 340,  Point 3), acquitted the accused Sinisa Rimac of the charges of  having murdered Mihajlo Zec on 7 December 1991 and of having  committed the murder of Marija Zec and Aleksandra Zec on 8  December together with the accused Munib Suljic, Igor Mikola,  Nebojsa Hodak, and Snezana Zivanovic; that is, it was not proven  that they committed the crimes of murder under Article 35,  Paragraph 1, of the KZRH [RH Criminal Code] (now Article 34,  Paragraph 1), which they were charged with.    ``The state's attorney did not appeal the acquittal section  of the verdict of the district court in Zagreb (now the zupanija  court in Zagreb), so that this verdict became final with respect  to that portion. Thus, the RH Supreme Court, as the court of  appeals, deliberated in this criminal case, in a session held on  8 June 1993, only the appeals of the defendants Munib Suljic and  Sinisa Rimac, filed against the conviction section of that  verdict, in which the Zec family was not the victim (IKz.  1270/92-3).    ``With respect to that criminal case, the RH Supreme Court  also ruled on the request of the RH state's attorney for  protection of legality, filed on 8 March 1993, against the  decision of the district court in Zagreb (now the zupanija court  in Zagreb) on 26 March 1992 (Kio-I-35/91), and in a session held  on 14 July 1993 it rejected in its verdict the request for  protection of legality as unfounded, since it established that  there was no violation of the law to which the state's attorney  referred in his request (KzZ-7/93-3).    ``In connection with the murder of Josip Reihl-Kir, we  report  that the district public prosecutor's office in Osijek (now the  district state's attorney's office in Osijek) issued an  indictment on 25 March 1993 (Kt-148/91), amended in writing on  12 April 1994, and initiated criminal proceedings against the  defendant Antun Gudelj, who is at large and inaccessible to  state authorities, for three cases of perfidious murder (when  Josip Reihl-Kir was murdered) under Article 35, Paragraph 2,  Subparagraphs 1 and 5, of the KZRH (now Article 34, Paragraph 2,  Subparagraphs 1 and 5) and one crime of attempted perfidious  murder under Article 35, Paragraph 2, Subparagraphs 1 and 5, of  the KZRH, related to Article 19, Paragraph 1, of the OKZRH  [Basic Criminal Code of the Republic of Croatia] (now Article  34, Paragraph 2, Subparagraphs 1 and 5, of the KZRH in  connection with Article 17, Paragraph 1, of the OKZRH). Criminal  proceedings are still underway, since the accused, according to  information in the file, is in Australia or Canada, and so up to  now, in spite of an international warrant, has not been  accessible to the state authorities and has not been extradited.    ``An inquiry has established that during criminal  proceedings  no attempt was made to influence or pressure the courts and  judges who tried the cases and rendered decisions in these cases.    ``As for the murders of Saban and Krivokuca, according to a  report of the presiding judges of the zupanija courts of  jurisdiction, criminal proceedings have not so far been  instituted,'' states the news release of the RH Supreme Court.    In conclusion the Supreme Court says that "the courts are  organized as bodies of judiciary authority, which they perform  independently and self-sufficiently within the competence  defined by law. All unfounded objections contrary to this  operation of the courts we judge to be harmful both to the  system of the independent and self-sufficient judiciary and also  to the creation of basic conditions for building Croatia as a  law-governed state," states the press release signed by Milan  Vukovic, presiding judge of the RH Supreme Court.</p>

			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Survey of Indonesia (2): An untried team takes the helm - The economy is basically sound but growth is not fast enough THE business community has been alive with gossip since the March cabinet reshuffle. Businessmen's concerns range from whether the economic ministers have the political support to push through further deregulation to whether the cabinet backs deregulation at all. The new government has taken over a macro-economy in relatively good fettle. In the last financial year, ending March 31, non-oil exports - such as textiles, shoes and consumer electronics - grew an estimated 21 per cent to Dollars 22.98bn allowing the country to maintain a small trade surplus. The cost of servicing foreign debt, however, resulted in a current account deficit of about Dollars 3.75bn in 1992/93, but this is a significant improvement on the Dollars 4.4bn deficit a year earlier. Not all the indicators are positive. Public and private international debt (with the latter making up an increasingly large proportion) rose from Dollars 80bn at the end of 1991 to Dollars 85bn-Dollars 90bn last December, although there has been a rise of almost equal magnitude in net foreign assets held by the banking sector. The debt service ratio remains stubbornly high at about 32 per cent of export proceeds, exacerbated by the recent appreciation of the yen in which 40 per cent of public foreign debt is denominated. Although Japan remains Indonesia's principal export market, trade in the four leading products - oil, liquefied natural gas, plywood and shrimps - is denominated in dollars. Fears over Indonesia's ability to service its foreign debt have led to speculation within the business community that the government may decide on a sharp 'one-off' devaluation of the rupiah. Such fears are almost certainly unfounded, not least because the government already has a policy of 'staggered depreciation', lowering the value of the rupiah against the dollar by about seven per cent a year. Indonesia also operates a free foreign exchange regime, so that a sudden devaluation could spur mass capital flight; it would lead to a surge in inflation - already running at about 10 per cent a year - from higher import costs; and inflation and the need to protect against capital flight would result in spiralling interest rates. The removal, however, of Messrs Radius Prawiro, JB Sumarlin and Adrianus Mooy, the three main economic technocrats of the last cabinet, has raised concerns over the government's ability to keep a tight rein over the economy. Their replacements - Mr Saleh Afiff, Mr Mar'ie Muhammad and Mr Sudradjat Djiwandono as coordinating minister for the economy and finance, finance minister and central bank governor respectively - are largely unproven and may lack the team-spirit developed by their predecessors. One safeguard against a dramatic policy swing is the need to placate donors, such as the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. Indonesia remains reliant upon donor aid - commitments in 1993/94 are expected to total about Dollars 5bn when donors meet in Paris on June 29-30 - to cover its current account deficit. And in spite of rumours, there is little evidence the new ministers plan anything other than to maintain prudent economic policies. Indeed, they have come out with surprisingly strong statements on the need to liberalise further and faster if Indonesia is to remain competitive with China and Vietnam, its two main rivals. While inflows of foreign investment may have peaked - and domestic investment, particularly from the Indonesian Chinese community, has fallen - it is difficult to imagine the trend of over six per cent annual growth being broken under the new administration. The question facing Indonesia, however, is whether six per cent growth is good enough. While developed economies would be delighted with growth at half that rate, Indonesia is not only starting at a low base - average per capita income is Dollars 620 a year - but it must absorb over 2m entrants to the labour market each year. Government ministers say seven per cent is the maximum growth the country can achieve without the economy overheating. The fact, however, that Malaysia and Thailand can maintain 8-10 per cent growth, and China is currently growing even faster, suggests that major impediments still exist within the Indonesian economy. It does not take a sleuth to see what the impediments are. Whereas export-oriented industries operate in a relatively free environment, the domestic economy remains blighted by public and private monopolies enjoying a high degree of tariff protection. Donors highlight the emerging petrochemicals sector as an example of where the country is going wrong. The government recently introduced a 25 per cent import tariff on polypropylene resin alongside a 30-40 per cent import tariff on plastic films with which the resin is made. Such tariffs allow politically well-connected businessmen to build petrochemical plants with little regard to minimising cost and still record handsome profits. Inefficiencies of this type affect almost every sector of the domestic economy from telecommunications to food-processing where the government's control of sugar imports keeps the cost of a key raw material high. Donors are also concerned at the level of government subsidy to state-owned high-technology industries such as aircraft manufacturing and ship-building. Ministers concede the industries make a loss but say finance is limited to the Rp660bn allocated under the state budget. Donors, and officials from the industries themselves, say funding is far higher, possibly exceeding Rp3,000bn a year. While the government officially operates a balanced budget, donors say about Dollars 1.5bn of revenue and expenditure (about five per cent of the total) is received and distributed each year off-budget. The extra money, from such sources as higher than anticipated oil-revenues, may be well spent but a lack of transparency is no incentive for efficient financial management. Deregulating the domestic economy and disbursing state revenue more efficiently will become increasingly important if the rate of growth in non-oil exports begins to decline. Battling with well-connected business monopolies and cash-hungry government enterprises, however, will require firm political will.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- BALANCE OF PAYMENTS (DOLLARS M)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                      1991/92*       1992/93*  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- CURRENT ACCOUNT Oil (net)                               2,158          2,190 Gas (net)                               2,404          2,294 Non-oil exports (fob)                  19,008         22,975 Non-oil imports (cif)                 (24,066)       (27,191) Non-oil services (net)                 (3,856)        (4,023)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                        (4,352)        (3,755)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- CAPITAL ACCOUNT Donor aid                               5,600          4,927 Debt repayments                        (4,182)        (4,656) Direct investments                      1,531          1,804 Other capital flows                     2,602          3,188  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                         5,551          5,308  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TOTAL                                   1,199          1,533 Net errors/omissions                     (218)          (118)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *Fiscal year, ending March 31 Source: Bank Indonesia  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

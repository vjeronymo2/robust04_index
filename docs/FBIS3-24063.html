			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Aleksandr Tarkayev, by A. Ganeyeva; place </F> and date not given: "The Deal Here Was Opportune"]    [Text] The topic of the day throughout the past week  continued to be the treaty "Delineation of Terms of Reference  and Mutual Delegation of Authority Between Organs of State Power  of the Russian Federation and Organs of State Power of the  Republic of Tatarstan," which was signed by the presidents of  Russia and Tatarstan. This exceptional event is being evaluated  by the world community positively, in the main, but within our  republic there are various opinions with regard to the document  that has been signed.    We looked for comment in this connection from Aleksandr  Tarkayev, chairman of the Trade and Industry Chamber of the  Tatarstan Administrative Council and director of Dialog--one of  Kazan's most important joint ventures.    "I believe that the signing of the treaty by the two  presidents was a most important event in the relations of Russia  and Tatarstan, more important even than it would appear to all  of us, perhaps. I had a call today from a director of our  affiliate in Yekaterinburg; he had read about the signing of the  treaty in the newspaper. His reaction was as follows: 'How good  an example you have set everyone of how it is possible to  resolve the most difficult problems in civilized and peaceful  fashion and within the framework of legality.' This has, truly,  occurred in the CIS for the first time.    "This is the opinion of a person who understands pretty  well,  but who is not directly involved in political processes.    "The treaty is an example of the victory of common sense.  Generally speaking, for me and business people it is not so much  the content of the treaty as the mere fact of its appearance  that is important. Business people have acquired firm ground  beneath their feet, when there are, finally, no questions about  separation and secession from the Russian Federation.    "We have truly achieved for ourselves that degree of freedom  that we wanted, although with certain cuts, of course, inasmuch  as this is a compromise. We would have liked somewhat more,  perhaps. But ultimately each side obtained as much as it was  able to bargain for itself in the course of the protracted  negotiating process. And there should be no embarrassment at  this word, because negotiations are, truly, bargaining. I  believe that the treaty will represent a very sound basis for  the further rapprochement of Russia and Tatarstan."    [Ganeyeva] What, in your view, will this treaty do for the  economy of Tatarstan?    [Tarkayev] Deciding many questions will be far simpler for  us  now on the basis of this treaty. Today international  organizations are investing enormous sums along the lines of  every conceivable Western investment fund--the Bank of  Reconstruction and Development, the World Bank, and others. And  they are moving via the Russian Government--and almost all these  resources are passing Tatarstan by. And it is not only a  question of money here, but of involvement in particular  processes of European structures also.    I have observed repeatedly that Tatarstan is a republic with  very strong ties to the defense industry. Our  military-industrial complex is, in any event, inseparably tied  to Russia's "defense." The settlement of relations with Russia  by this treaty will, in addition, provide a base for the future  of tens of thousands of people who work in the defense industry.  And how their children are fed and clothed will depend to a  large extent on the state of the defense industry and,  consequently, relations with Russia.    [Ganeyeva] Calling for a boycott of the coming elections,  deputies of the Supreme Soviet of Tatarstan from national  parties and movements are explaining this by the fact that there  cannot be real sovereignty when the leadership of one republic  is part of the leadership of another state. What is your  attitude toward the elections?    [Tarkayev] I have a positive attitude toward the elections,  because Tatarstan has never imagined itself separate from  Russia. When the leaders of the national movement tell me that  in a separate republic we would create our own Kuwait, I tell  them quite sharply: They would, at best, create a Lesotho or  Transkei. Never would they create a Kuwait inside Russia and as  part of Russia.    I view the treaty positively for the added reason that I  believe that it should be on the one hand truly a real subject  of election debate and that, on the other, we will see with our  own eyes what kind of support the nationalists have in reality.    And, finally, what is most important from the legal  standpoint.    What is sovereignty? It is the supremacy of the say of a  particular part of the people. If this people approves the  treaty and votes in favor of representatives of the republic  being part of the Federal Assembly, and if it sends Shaymiyev,  Mukhametshin, or Lozovoy there, what is there more to be said in  this connection by Bayramova or Tarkayev?    So the coming elections should clear up a great deal and put  things in their place.</p>

			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / NSK extends plant shutdown THE CHRISTMAS and new year shutdown has been extended by the European subsidiary of NSK, the Japanese bearings manufacturer, at its plant in Peterlee, County Durham, until Monday because of the effect of the recession. The 800 employees at NSK Bearings Europe's plant in Peterlee should have resumed work on January 2, but NSK decided to postpone reopening in order to cut stock levels. The shutdown, the first serious UK setback for NSK in the 15 years since it set up at Peterlee, is a response to a fall estimated at 20 per cent in European demand for bearings in the past year. The bearings plant, which exports 80 per cent of its output to continental Europe, has been particularly affected by the economic slowdown in Germany, its biggest market. The company was yesterday reluctant to discuss the possibility of short-time working or redundancies but Mr Bill Constance, deputy managing director for NSK in Europe, said: 'If the current recession continues, we would have to consider very seriously further measures to those we have already taken.' NSK, Japan's largest bearings manufacturer - and the second biggest worldwide after SKF of Sweden - has invested Pounds 100m at Peterlee, where its success helped persuade Nissan to select the north-east for a car plant. NSK's automotive components division, which employs 50 workers at Peterlee, is not affected by the shutdown. Overtime working at the bearings plant was ended last year in an attempt to cut costs. Mr Constance said NSK had anticipated some improvement in market demand early this year, but it was now clear this would not occur in the first quarter. Komatsu, the Japanese earth-moving equipment manufacturer, also extended the new-year closure at its sole European production plant. Its 400 employees at Birtley, Tyne and Wear, returned to work on Monday instead of January 2. Last year Komatsu shed 30 jobs at Birtley, and yesterday Mr Clive Morton, personnel director, said the plant's workload would be lower this year than last. Komatsu has not yet decided how it will cope with lower production volumes this year. Mr Constance said that, contrary to popular belief, Japanese companies were not recession-proof. The recession has also slowed expansion plans at Fujitsu's new Pounds 200m semiconductor plant at Newton Aycliffe, County Durham. Negotiations to bring a Japanese engineering business to Darlington were halted last year because the Japanese company involved decided the recession would last until next year.</p>

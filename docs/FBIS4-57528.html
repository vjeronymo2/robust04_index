			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President-elect Ernesto Perez Balladares by </F> "Democracy '94" program host Hugo Enrique Famania at the RPC  Television studios in Panama City; date not given -- live or  recorded]    [Text] [Famania] Mr. Perez Balladares, good evening and  thank you for being with us.    [Perez Balladares] My pleasure. Good evening to all.    [Famania] Mr. Perez Balladares, 106 days have elapsed since  you came to "Democracy '94" and we reviewed your campaign  promises. On that occasion you said there were firms interested  in fulfilling some of your plans; for example, the David-Paso  Canoas expressway, the Panama-Colon expressway, the  Chorrera-Capira expressway. How have these firms reacted to  your victory?    [Perez Balladares] They are preparing to come here. We  started contacting them the day our victory was proclaimed and  we are still doing it. There are Mexican firms, some U.S.  firms, and a Spanish firm. They are preparing to come to Panama  to talk about the projects, especially the Panama-Colon  expressway, which is the one that interests us most.    [Famania] When do you think you might begin these projects,  which will become the employment solutions you also promised to  give?    [Perez Balladares] The ideal time would be during the dry  months of 1995, meaning January. Of course we must first wait  for 1 September [chuckles] and then get the entire government  interested in this topic, the public works minister and everyone  concerned. The final designs must be prepared. We think they  could be done quickly, probably in three months. Then we would  start working during the dry months, January and February 1995.    [Famania] Some phrases have resurfaced following your 8 May  victory. The one about a shower of money for the ruling party  reminds us of the PRD's [Democratic Revolutionary Party]  populism. What will you do to change the perception that even  PRD members have about your government?    [Perez Balladares] I think it is obvious that times are  different from what they were during the 1970's when I  participated and during the last years of the military  government, which was not a PRD government. Now all Panamanians  face a problem: the actual management of the Panama Canal as of  31 December 1999. Obviously, this will not be my duty, but I am  certainly responsible for preparing everything. As I said  during the campaign, we must have the best men and women in the  government and at decisionmaking levels, regardless of politics.  We must set aside party views.    I have always said I would try my best to achieve a  government based on a concerted effort, consensus, and national  unity, and I am doing it, even though I am not president yet. I  am simply the president-elect who is forming a government team  which, thanks to the democratic transition, is becoming fully  acquainted with Panama's problems. We will carry out our plans  with programs we can all share, using national unity to face the  challenges ahead of us.    [Famania] Could exchanging the PRD's populist image for  another policy erode the party's popularity?    [Perez Balladares] No, because it is not a conceptual  change. Our party and our government will continue to focus on  resolving the problems of the humblest, neediest people. We  cannot think that it will be done as easily as in the past, when  we had the funds to finance social programs. We know it will be  more difficult now, but with a certain degree of intelligence  and some ingenuity, we will manage to do it. Our party will  continue to be a party of consultation and dialogue, a party  that talks with the people, a party that brings solutions to the  communities.    [Famania] What will happen after 1 September? Will people  who sought asylum in other countries return?    [Perez Balladares] I also said during the political campaign  -- and this is another promise I will keep, as I will keep all  the promises I made -- that we do not want any Panamanians in  exile for any reason. Any Panamanian against whom criminal  charges have been filed, however, must face those charges. We  do not intend to pardon anyone or authorize anyone's entrance or  departure. On the other hand, we do not want to put anyone in  jail. Panamanians who currently face charges but manage to  avoid being arrested through normal legal means according to  Panamanian laws can return, if that is what they are worried  about.    [Famania] Speaking of justice, when names were proposed for  attorney general, several names were also proposed for Supreme  Court of Justice magistrates. Does that mean there will be  changes in the Supreme Court of Justice?    [Perez Balladares] I will respect the terms for which the  magistrates were appointed, which was not the case in 1989. I  understand, however, that those terms are about to end.  Consequently, there will be replacements in the Supreme Court of  Justice when those terms expire. There are candidates to  replace those magistrates.    [Famania] What criteria will the government use to make  those changes?    [Perez Balladares] The same criteria we have used for all  the appointments: We will choose the best person available for  the job.    [Famania] Some people have said the policy of rapprochement  you are talking about means establishing a Torrijist government  without any Torrijists in power. We will take a break and  discuss this when we return.    [Famania] When we went off the air for commercials, we were  saying that some people already say this policy of consensus is  like a Torrijist government without Torrijists, and this entails  a contradiction. What consistency...[pauses] How can you  preside over a government with any consistency if some of its  members do not support the PRD?    [Perez Balladares] I think you are mistaken if you believe  that everyone who identifies himself as a Torrijist because he  shares Torrijos' methods and doctrine must necessarily be a  member of the PRD. That is not true. A great number of  Panamanians -- twice the number of people in our party -- voted  for our proposals, which are Torrijist proposals, and they are  obviously not members of our party. Looking at history, I think  one of the things that characterized Omar Torrijos' governments  was precisely the fact that they did include people from  different parties, from different places -- yet they were the  best people to do the work that needed to be done at the time.    Obviously, as time goes by, as things are done together, you  feel an identification that later becomes a party  identification. In the beginning, none of us were members of  any party. I say us because I was a minister during Torrijos'  time, yet I had never been an active member of a political  party. Others had been members of different parties, as  different as the Liberal Party, the National Patriotic  Coalition, which was its opponent, and the Communist Party of  Panama. In other words, what occurred was an integration of  wills from different political currents. That is the Torrijos  method.    [Famania] During the electoral campaign, people who were  standard bearers of the last phase of the military government  were mentioned as possible members of your government.  Rigoberto Paredes, Lucho Gomez, and others were mentioned. You  know them better than we do. To what extent will these people  be members of your government team?    [Perez Balladares] Well, you have seen my appointees.  Unfortunately, many of these people were, in my opinion,  demonized. In other words, they were stigmatized. Many of them  made mistakes, and others did not. They, however, bear that  stigma. I think that they are valuable men and women, but,  unfortunately, it is not very easy to integrate them into  government posts with that stigma.    [Famania] You spoke of professionalizing the police and said  Oswaldo Fernandez should remain in his post. How have party  members who once belonged to the military apparatus reacted to  that decision?    [Perez Balladares] Famania, I have not done anything I did  not mention ahead of time. I am doing what I said I would do  because I did not lie to the Panamanian people. I said we would  form a professional police force, and I will do just that. I  said the professional police force will be headed by a civilian  and will be under the command of a civilian. I think Mr.  Fernandez has done a good job. I do not want to create any  instability in the police force during a change of government  that will make some people apprehensive. That is why I asked  Mr. Fernandez to remain as police chief. I am keeping my  promises.    [Famania] I asked you this question because on this program,  "Democracy '94," many politicians who opposed you said, and I  quote: We are not afraid of El Toro, but of the herd of cattle  behind him. End quote.    [Perez Balladares] [laughs] I have always said that there  are  157,000 members in my party, and 99.9 percent of them are good,  decent men and women. Under no circumstances should all party  members be stigmatized for the good or bad actions -- in this  case bad -- of a small few, that is, 10 to 15 people.    I also said my commitment to democracy is not just external  but internal. There is internal democracy in my party.  Consequently, I cannot set myself up as supreme judge and tell a  person: You cannot be a member of my party because you have a  bad reputation, a reputation that has not even been proven.    What I can do is utilize or not utilize a person in my  government. I said at that time that I was more concerned about  people who were around several candidates, people who had been  chosen by those candidates. I saw in them a high degree of  instability, a failure to inspire a feeling of security. Thank  God they did not win.    [Famania] How have political groups that were your  opponents reacted when you asked them to participate in your  government?    [Perez Balladares] I have to be very honest. I sincerely  believe that a majority of Panamanians realize that the  electoral campaign is over. That beautiful page of the final  campaign months and of 8 May, the day of civic performance that  is a source of pride for all of us, has been turned. The  Electoral Tribunal has done its part, as has the Vote-Counting  Board. Now we are moving on to five years of work to make  Panama a better country. I think many of our adversaries have  this spirit.    When the Electoral Tribunal opens the election process in  1999, we will again put on the t-shirts and caps of the various  parties, but between now and then, let us all work together for  Panama.    [Famania] How do you reconcile this good reaction you have  mentioned with the fact that some political parties do not want  to participate in your government?    [Perez Balladares] I respect that position. In democracy,  there must be parties that want to remain out of the government.  I am happy, though, that Carlos Sousa, the designated  agricultural development minister, accepted his appointment even  at the cost of resigning from his party, something that was  difficult to do.    I understand that he see this commitment as being above  party  commitments. Many other people see it that way. The cabinet is  integrating a group of people who are independent; that is,  people who do not belong to any active political party.    [Famania] Some people believe a government of this nature is  dangerous because the government, the government policymaker,  may try to demonstrate that people of a certain affiliation are  not the best people for the job, then these people would say  that other parties are not any good either, or the members of  other parties may try to sabotage the government. Are you  afraid this might happen?    [Perez Balladares] Hugo, I am assembling what you could  think  of as an orchestra. I have looked for the best violinist, the  best drummer, the best percussionist, the best people. It  depends on me to make the band sound good or bad. I am the  director of that orchestra. The government will do well or  poorly depending on me. I am the president-elect.    [Famania] A few seconds ago you mentioned the election  process we went through a few days ago. Magistrates have a  definite term. The period of one of the magistrates expires in  1998.    [Perez Balladares] Electoral Tribunal magistrates?    [Famania] Yes, the Electoral Tribunal. What will happen to  that magistrate?    [Perez Balladares] On the day the Electoral Tribunal  magistrates declared the election results, I said I viewed the  three Electoral Tribunal magistrates to be outstanding men of  the nation. They have done an extraordinary job. I also said,  not knowing when their terms expire, that I hope they will stay.  I also want to give greater independence to the Electoral  Tribunal through constitutional changes, which is what is  required, and I think that we can achieve this soon. I think we  can do it soon. Right now, I do not hesitate to ask the  magistrate whose period expires in 1998 -- according to what you  have told me -- to stay.    [Famania] Right. Will your party agree to that?    [Perez Balladares] If this is a proposal I have to make,  then  I will make it, not the party.    [Famania] You have spoken about giving more independence to  the Electoral Tribunal through constitutional changes. There  are three ways to change the Constitution. Which would you use?    [Perez Balladares] The least traumatic one: approval by this  Legislative Assembly of the constitutional changes we are  planning to introduce and ratification by the new Legislative  Assembly, which has already been elected and will take office on  1 September.    [Famania] In addition to greater autonomy for the Tribunal,  what other ....    [Perez Balladares, interrupting] The definition of the role  of the national police law is a very important topic for us, and  we cannot work on it until we implement changes to remove the  constitutional duties that still belong to an institution  formerly called the National Guard. In the next two weeks, we  will try to negotiate a consensus among the various political  forces in the National Legislative Assembly. After we reach a  consensus, we will discuss granting the Electoral Tribunal  greater autonomy -- which I believe is crucial -- and reforming  the Constitution to draft the future police law. Creating a  human rights ombudsman's office is a third reform that I  consider vital and hope to see implemented.    [Famania] If a proposal is made in the Legislative Assembly  to broaden these reforms, it may lead us to a situation similar  to that faced in 1992. Are you afraid of failing?    [Perez Balladares] Indeed, I am afraid. That is why I insist  we must work with the various political forces in the Assembly  so it will approve the three reforms and the next legislature  will ratify them.    [Famania] How will these constitutional reforms be presented  through the commission....    [Perez Balladares, interrupting] The only way we can do it  is  with the approval of the president and the current government,  who are the ones who have the legislative initiative to do it.  To do it in a different way, a Legislative Assembly initiative,  is more difficult. I invite President Endara to talk about this  topic soon so that we can implement it.    [Famania] Mr. Perez Balladares' proposals include the  reinstatement of public employees who were dismissed, if they  wish to be reinstated. We will talk about that topic and some  others during this program, "Democracy '94."    [Three-minute break for commercials]    [Femania] We are back with "Democracy '94." This is our  17th and last in a series of programs during which we have  discussed Panama's political situation. Today we are closing  this program with the president-elect. During the commercials,  we discussed the case of the employees who were dismissed.  Before that, I forgot to mention something important about the  elections. The transition period lasts 114 days. An expert  said that if the counting process was so short, a long  transition period might be hard to bear. Why not modernize it  by making it shorter? What do you think?    [Perez Balladares] Yes, I think it could be a future reform.  Right now it is already set and we must comply with the law.  But yes, I believe that shortening it would be good for the  next president-elect and the outgoing president as well. I  agree with that.    [Famania] This expert mentioned more traumatic or difficult  cases such as that in South Africa, where the transition period  was only two weeks.    [Perez Balladares] That is so. Perhaps, a month or a month  and a half would be better than the long period we have.    [Famania] Let us discuss those who were dismissed. Many of  them were dismissed through a law. The only way to reinstate  them would be with another law. What method would you use?    [Perez Balladares] In our party, we are working out a way to  assess the cases of those who feel they were unjustly dismissed  and want to work for the government again. This will be done on  a case-by-case basis. There are some people who were unjustly  dismissed but do not want to be reinstated. They are working in  the private sector or have set up their own businesses and are  very pleased with what they are doing.    Those who feel they were unjustly dismissed and want to  return should know that we are going to evaluate each case.  Then we will proceed administratively without resorting to a  law because there is no need for a framework law [ley marco]. A  framework was established in the recent past. It did not  dismiss name by name but established an alleged framework which  the government used as a basis for dismissing a number of public  employees.    We would proceed, administratively, to reinstate those who  were unjustly dismissed -- it would have to be proven that they  were, in fact, unjustly dismissed -- and who want to be  reinstated.    [Famania] Do your public proposals, statements, and  appointments have any effect on the transition team? I ask  because we do not have much experience in this business of going  from one government to another. We do not know how a transition  team works.    [Perez Balladares] This is the first time in many years that  we have had an orderly democratic transition. In fact, when  there were honest, democratic elections a couple of times in the  country's history, there was no transition period during which  the two teams could interact. We are learning and perhaps we  will make some mistakes, mistakes in good faith. There are very  competent people on our side and on the side of President  Endara, who wants this to be done in the least traumatic way.  He wants the new officials to use this time to familiarize  themselves with the issues the current officials are coping with  in their ministries and autonomous institutions. Of course, I  repeat what I said before: President Endara will continue to be  in command as he has always been, as he is right now, and as he  will be until 1 September. His ministers will continue to be in  charge and his officials will continue to be responsible for  their jobs.    This is not just a transition period but a learning period.  It is a time to learn about the matters that require action  from the state.    [Famania] How is the communication flow? To what degree is  there tolerance? Have there been any situations where the  current government has said something like: This is a state  secret and we cannot discuss it.    [Perez Balladares] So far we have not been denied any  information. We have been denied nothing. I think there has  been a great desire for cooperation.    [Famania] Let us talk about international relations. You  mentioned two visits abroad. On 20 May, you will go to Costa  Rica and on 25 May to Colombia. What countries will follow?  What will you propose during your visits? What is the reason  for these visits?    [Perez Balladares] I am visiting our two neighbors to  exchange views on common problems with Costa Rica and Colombia.  That is why I am visiting those countries first. In mid-June,  I plan to visit eastern countries like Japan, Taiwan, and South  Korea, because I believe these countries see tangible  possibilities of investing in import industries in the Canal  area.    I want to take this opportunity to make the trip at my own  expense, by the way. I do not want anyone thinking that I am  using state funds. [laughs]    [Famania] That was my next question. [laughter]    [Perez Balladares] I will use my own money and make this  trip now because I think it will be very difficult for me to  leave the country later. There are too many things that need to  be done. I want to take 15 days for that trip.    I will probably visit the EC sometime after 15 July.  Europeans have a month vacation period during their summer,  July and August. We will have to decide when to take this trip.    I also plan to go to Washington. I have already been invited  to hold a number of meetings with the U.S. Government.    [Famania] Have you received any direct message from the U.S.  President?    [Perez Balladares] Yes. I received a congratulatory letter  from President Clinton in which he talked about this topic and  other matters of mutual interest.    [Famania] You said you will visit the EC. There is a  pending banana problem with the EC countries. Are you going to  present a proposal in line with your policy?    [Perez Balladares] We must include the Panamanian banana  issue within the GATT agreements. We cannot be asked to be open  when doors are being closed to our exports. Consequently, this  is a topic we want to include in our talks with the EC,  particularly with our friends the Spaniards, who can better help  us solve this problem.    [Famania] We are discussing foreign policy. What will be  the nature of Panama's relations with Cuba under your  administration?    [Perez Balladares] We must maintain such relations under  conditions that are equal to those we maintain with the rest of  the countries of the world -- without more consideration or less  consideration. We have interests in many countries; Cuba is one  of them. It is not the one in which we have the most or the  fewest interests. Thus, I think that we must maintain friendly  relations, based on mutual respect, without our meddling, of  course, in their domestic affairs or their meddling in ours.    [Famania] Many believe that our policy toward Cuba calls for  special treatment because it is a country subject to a blockade  that is yet to be the target of many decisions at the  international level. What will Panama's attitude be in the face  of this situation?    [Perez Balladares] It is worth noting that the blockade is a  foreign policy of the U.S. Government. A great majority of  countries in Latin America and the rest of the world do not have  a blockade against Cuba; that is, they hold normal trade  relations with it. I think that this issue must be settled  between the United States and Cuba.    [Famania] Let us change the subject but continue with  foreign policy. Let us discuss the Parlacen [Central American  Parliament]. A few days ago, the law including Panama in this  Central American multinational organization was approved in a  third debate at the legislature. You said in your campaign,  however, that Panama had more ties or it would be better for it  to be linked to stronger blocs in South America or to join  NAFTA. How do you harmonize this new law with your policy?    [Perez Balladares] We cannot ignore two facts:  geographically, we are part of Central America, and politically,  we have much affinity with the Central American countries.  Historically, however, we have had more similarity with South  America and economically, we have had greater affinity with  NAFTA and South America.    Parlacen is a political mechanism. It is the Central  American Parliament. I think we can join the Parlacen without  it being a contradiction to our possible direct integration into  NAFTA.    [Famania] There are people who are saying that the fact  Panamanian parliamentarians would join organizations such as the  Parlacen only mean that some Panamanians would be benefited with  certain privileges. What do you think?    [Perez Balladares] That is being narrow-minded. That is not  seeing the need to have a forum for political discussions. That  is what it is. It is a forum for the exchange of objectives  that could be subregional -- Central American, in this case. I  think one should not think that way.    [Famania] Luis Ochoa Teran, the Venezuelan ambassador to  Panama, said that after the 8 May elections, Panama earned, by  its own right, its reintegration into groups such as the Rio  Group, for example. With regard to that, are there any efforts  being made in that direction?    [Perez Balladares] We are going to work very hard so that we  can again belong to a group that Panama founded -- a group that  was once called the Contadora Group and which is now known as  the Rio Group. It is also a forum of conversation and unity of  Latin American policies in the face of world problems.    [Famania] There is another important factor: Panama's  economic growth. How will your government maintain this growth?  How will it maintain this level of economic growth and how will  it transform it into social development?    [Perez Balladares] As an economist, the only way that I know  economic growth can be changed into economic [as heard]  development is through public investment programs, in other  words, something all Panamanians will receive as part of a  distribution of national wealth. Perhaps the aspect with the  most positive impact within this public investment program is an  improvement in the quality of education. We have devoted much  time and effort to that aspect and we will devote even more time  and effort to it. It is evident that we have discussed other  matters such as infrastructure projects. For example, there is  the Panama-Colon freeway, the ports, more roads to improve  traffic circulation in Panama City. These are works to  redistribute wealth; however, the ones that have the most social  impact are basically education and health.    [Famania] One issue of much concern is freedom of  expression.  How will you harmonize the interest of the media as a business  to establish itself and continue to work in Panama and the  interest that some journalists could have to control this  profession?    [Perez Balladares] I think the two issues must be separated.  I think there should be full freedom of expression. Some  actions I have taken prove this. During the campaign, I vowed  to guarantee freedom of expression. I have been asking  journalists I have met with, including some who have attacked  me.... [pauses] I told them that I met with them to defend  their right to attack me....    [Famania interrupting] Including EL CAMALEON? [laughter]    [Perez Balladares] [laughter] Yes, EL CAMALEON. I do not  think people come ahead of national interests. I believe  journalists -- I asked them to do that -- should meet to jointly  present a program, plan, or a bill to abolish the various  existing regulations, laws, and decrees that in some way  restrict freedom of expression. I think that they should be  abolished in the broadest and quickest way.    We need to eliminate the discretionary rule that the  executive branch applies through the Government and Justice  Ministry because it is a threat to freedom of expression.    I also believe we must establish a more effective and faster  mechanism so that the people who feel slandered can sue for  compensation through a civil and not a criminal court. These  two topics should be covered in a law. I also think there  should be communication, dialogue, and negotiation, if needed,  between media owners and news associations to establish laws to  protect journalists. These laws could cover a broad area  ranging from compulsory membership, if that is what you decide,  to permitting a person to exercise this profession with  guaranteed tenure in the media.    [Famania] Following the campaign and after the elections,  there has been great communication between reporters and Ernesto  Perez Balladares.    [Perez Balladares] It will continue, Hugo.    [Famania] I was heading in that direction. How will this  vary? Will we continue to communicate?    [Perez Balladares] Always.    [Famania] It will be that simple?    [Perez Balladares] Mario Velasquez is the man whom we put in  charge; he will be our spokesman from the Presidency. He will  be our contact with the media. Boris Moreno is my private  secretary. He will have my agenda but, in addition, he is a  journalist. So you will have a way to contact me indirectly. I  will always be willing and accessible.    [Famania] Aside from all the telephone numbers to find you,  it will be so easy.    [Perez Balladares] In addition, I have not changed my home  or  office telephones and I will not change them.    [Famania] Businessmen say that one of your top challenges is  to maintain political stability in Panama. What is your plan to  accomplish this?    [Perez Balladares] Well, it is just what we have been  achieving. I think that during these two weeks after the  elections we have been creating this climate of tranquility and  political stability. It caught my attention when I left the  Atlapa Convention Center at dawn on Monday (9 May) -- well, it  was not dawn anymore, it was 0700 -- and I saw people going to  work normally. The campaign was over and we had entered a  period of normalcy, a day of work and stability in Panama. I  want to continue with this commitment and I will do everything I  can to continue this normalcy.    [Famania] Can we trust we will have better or the same kind  of elections in 1999?    [Perez Balladares] This is why I want to introduce, if  possible, in agreement with all political forces and with  President Endara, a constitutional reform giving greater  independence to the Electoral Tribunal. This is a commitment I  have. Perhaps some people still have doubts that I will do it.  But there is no doubt I will do it. If we can include in the  Constitution that the Electoral Tribunal will have total  independence, then there will be no room for doubts that it is  my interest to have those elections.    [Famania] This is something unusual. We will now give you a  few seconds for you, without any questions on our part, to send  a message to all Panamanians.    [Perez Balladares] I want to say I am very proud of the  electoral process. I am proud of the way the Panamanian people  participated, the high level of civic spirit they showed. I am  proud we were able to have a civic campaign and that our  government will be a reflection of the mandate we received. I  cannot close without thanking this program because you were one  of the biggest supporters of the electoral campaign. With great  civic spirit, you allowed the candidates to express their views  and the Panamanian people were able to make their choice freely.  I thank you and this enterprise.</p>

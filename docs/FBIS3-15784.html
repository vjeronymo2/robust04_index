The poll will probably put an end to debates centered not  only on the degree to which unification with Romania is sensible  and historically justified, but also on what to actually call  the people. Victory for the Agrarians in the parliamentary  elections and the attendant insurance for the "Counsel with the  People" policy being conducted by them have clarified this  question: The state bears the name Moldova, Moldovans live in  it, and they speak Moldovan. It seems that the epithet  "Romanian," having dominated all spheres of republic life in  recent years, is on the way out. The Agrarians also promise to  review the national anthem, which is identical to that of  Romania. What is Romania's reaction to this unexpected turn of  events in Moldova? A group of eminent representatives from the  Moldovan intelligentsia sent a protest to the United Nations  assessing the negative backlash on the part of the Romanian  press and certain political movements as interference in  Moldova's domestic affairs.    Using the results of the poll, the parliamentary majority  will doubtless push a decision on the status of the southern and  eastern regions through the legislative body even before a new  constitution is adopted.    But although a draft law on the Gagauz question has already  been agreed, dialogue with the Dniester Region has yet to begin,  and it will not be easy. The Tiraspol authorities are  interpreting the majority of that region's inhabitants'  non-participation in the elections to the Moldovan parliament,  and subsequently in the national poll too, as a declaration of  the region's own statehood. However, the hope was expressed in  the Dniester Region that with the victory of the Agrarian  Democratic Party relations between Chisinau and Tiraspol will  alter radically, and Moldova will "embark on a constructive  path."    The first session of the new parliament is expected to  ratify  the agreements on the CIS.    With the defeat of the idea of unification with Romania, a  number of ministers are expected to leave, first and foremost  the ministers of culture and education, and the head of the  languages department. The most extreme activists of the  People's Front are represented in the leadership of these  departments.</p>

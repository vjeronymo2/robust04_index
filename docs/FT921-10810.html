			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / Steel deal sounds a clear warning: The effect the German steelworkers' pay settlement will have on other unions - and on the economy One clear signal crackled through the static on Germany's economic airwaves yesterday: if the rest of this year's pay settlements follow the pattern of the steel deal, the world could face an extended wait before the Bundesbank broadcasts its message of goodwill to the world, and starts cutting interest rates. Recovery from recession in Britain, France and elsewhere is being hampered by high borrowing rates in Germany. But pressure from these countries has failed to shift the independent central bank in Frankfurt from its insistence that the squeeze cannot be eased until there are clear signs that domestic inflation is under control and, preferably, on the way down to 2 per cent from a current annual rate of 4.2 per cent. Instead, the Bundesbank will be worried that yesterday's agreement will hamper attempts to curb inflation and will lead to even higher settlements. After last year's 6 per cent pay rise in the steel sector, in a year when inflation averaged 3.5 per cent, this year's overall 6.35 per cent package is inflationary. Even though the 5.9 per cent increase in basic pay looks more acceptable when set against expected price inflation of 4.5 per cent, it raises questions about the wisdom of employers who have made no bones about the dire state of their industry, which incurred losses or drastically reduced profits last year and which is expected to show only a 2 per cent increase in productivity this year. While relief that a strike had been averted prompted shares in steel companies to rise by a few points, there were concerns about the longer term implications for the steel industry and for its impact on other industries. 'The settlement was too high,' said one Frankfurt broker. 'It will send the wrong message to other unions.' German employers, however, were more optimistic. Mr Klaus Murmann, president of the BDA employers' association, the largest employers association in Germany, said the deal was the first sign that the giant IG Metall union, which starts next month to negotiate on behalf of the 4m engineers which it also represents, was prepared to compromise. But the agreement reached with the steelworkers also reflects a reluctance on the part of management to avoid poisoning relations with IG Metall before the negotiations with the engineers. The union itself was more cryptic. Mr Klaus Zwickel, deputy chairman, said the basic figures in the agreement, 5.9 per cent and 6.35 per cent, formed 'an interesting corridor' which would be helpful to other unions in the coming pay rounds. If they stick to centre of the corridor, then there is every likelihood that come the autumn, pay will no longer be a core concern in Frankfurt. But can the steel settlement, affecting 130,000 workers, be seen as an indicator for the millions of employees still waiting their turn to negotiate? Mr Franz Steinkuhler, the IG Metall union chairman, seemed yesterday to suggest that it could. The deal was 'a reasonable basis for other pay settleimportant aim of bringing steel workers' pay closer to parity with the engineers. That suggests that the union will not press in the short term, at least, to increase the differential. It is significant that IG Metall has already warned its engineering negotiators not to put in claims for more than 9.5 per cent, compared with the 10.5 per cent demand which launched the steel workers on the road to the cliff's edge. But there is still dissent, notably among public service unions, led by Mrs Monika Wulf-Mathies at OTV, which represents the majority of public officials and which starts talks shortly on its 9.5 per cent claim. Yesterday's agreement, the union said, gave 'no grounds for us to rewrite our demands'. The OTV negotiations will provide the next great test of establishment resolve. According to CDU officials at a meeting with Mr Helmut Kohl yesterday, the chancellor made no comments on the steel settlement, but he was anxious that the public servants should not 'get the wrong message' on pay. According to Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister, a settlement at 9.5 per cent would cost Bonn and the state governments an extra DM38bn this year, which they cannot afford. State governments have already been instructed by Bonn to limit public spending growth in western Germany to 2 per cent this year. The OTV talks are likely to be even more tense than those of the steel industry since they bring a leading trade union into conflict with the socialist governments that control most German states. Although senior ministers have been careful not to become embroiled in the pay round as a whole, Mr Kohl has warned several times recently that the government takes its job as an employer seriously. Mrs Wulf-Mathies has on each occasion countered with threats that her membership is prepared to cripple the administration with stoppages if its pay - currently 14 per cent below the industrial average - is not brought into line. Trade union negotiators who have not yet settled have made much of the argument that since the steel talks started last October they belonged properly to the 1991 pay round. But there is little doubt that the steel agreement sets a pattern. Banking employers, confronted with a strike ballot among workers refusing their 4.5 per cent offer, will now find it impossible to resist further and are likely to make concessions. While an average national 6 per cent increase may be just acceptable to the board of the Bundesbank, which dictates monetary policy in Germany, it is certain to increase the pressure for cost-cutting across industry. National productivity is expected to increase just 2.5 per cent his year. Growth in gross national product is forecast at 1.5 per cent, and average unemployment in the west of Germany is estimated at about 1.8m compared with 1.1m last year. The picture darkened further yesterday with publication of industrial production figures which showed that the manufacturing index fell in December to 117.6 from 121.3 in November. Steel workers, already feeling the pressure of job cuts, will be hit especially hard. Their employers, who are confronted by recession in all world markets, a sharp downturn at home, and cheap steel from the former Soviet Union and South Korea, will be unable to pass on extra wage costs, according to Mr Rudiger Pohl, a leading independent economic adviser to the government. While a 'stone had fallen from his heart' with the news that the steel strike had been called off, he, too, was concerned that the settlement would set the pattern for the year. Capital investment would be depressed, he said, and while he saw no danger of a full recession, economic expansion would be lower than expected. And if expansion in the west is endangered, then recovery in the east - still in a desperate economic condition - will be compromised. This worry was far from people's minds in the steel state of North Rhine Westphalia yesterday. As one worker commented, he and virtually all his colleagues had voted for the first stoppage in 13 years in defence of their 10.5 per cent pay claim. And now they were being asked by their leaders to settle for 6.35 per cent. Approval is expected at a ballot next week, and the steel workers will carry on, nursing their grievances. But it was, in fact, the beleaguered steel workers who set a pattern for this year's pay round. Their vote, with a 95 per cent turnout and an 87 per cent majority of all members in favour of strikes, sent a clear signal to employers throughout Germany. In proving their willingness to stop work with so little to be gained in cash terms, and in proving that employers are prepared to settle above 6 per cent, they will have encouraged union members all over the country to adopt similar tactics and win for themselves similar, and possibly greater short-term rewards.  --------------------------------------------------------------- WAGE ROUND FOR 1992  --------------------------------------------------------------- TALKS START   INDUSTRY           CLAIM     EMPLOYEES  --------------------------------------------------------------- Feb 7         Public servants     9.5%         2.7m Feb 29        Wholsale/retail      -         340,000 Mar 31        Engineering         9.5%*        4m Mar 31        Construction        9.8%         1m Mar 31        Private transport    -         398,000 Mar 31        Printing             -         185,000 Apr 30        Textiles             -         200,000 Apr 30        Clothing             -         140,000 Jun 30        Chemicals            -         725,000 Oct 31        Insurance            -         260,000  --------------------------------------------------------------- * Recommended maximum claim Source: IWD Institute, Cologne  ---------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / International Capital Markets: Indian telecoms network to make Dollars 500m offering VIDESH Sanchar Nigam, the Indian state-controlled international telecommunications network, is planning a USDollars 500m international equity issue, the biggest-ever share offer by an Indian company and the first from the public sector. The plan highlights the increasing ability of Indian companies to raise funds in international markets as a result of economic reforms. Videsh Sanchar Nigam follows about 10 other Indian companies into the international capital markets. Together they plan to raise about USDollars 1bn by the end of January. This surge of issues is matched by a wave of interest among overseas fund managers in the Indian stock market. India has attracted about USDollars 270m this year in foreign financial investments, according to finance ministry figures, though stockbrokers put the total as high as USDollars 450m. VSNL, which has been partially privatised over the last two years, is one of the most profitable enterprises in the generally poorly-performing Indian public sector. In the year to last March, it made net profits of Rs1.12bn (Dollars 35.7m) on sales of Rs7.4bn. The company plans to sell 20m shares in the international markets and 16m in a separate domestic share offering, which will raise a further USDollars 400m. The state's holding will fall from 85 per cent to 52 per cent. Mr BK Syngal, chairman, said he had 'many exciting plans', including investments in international satellite communications links. VSNL has also invested USDollars 100m in a submarine cable running from Bombay to Marseilles in the west and Singapore in the east, which would connect India with high-speed international digital connections. Other plans include expansion in video conferencing, mobile telecommunications, electronic mail and high-speed data transfer. VSNL also plans to lay domestic optical fibre links, partly to improve India's international links and partly for lease to the Department of Telecommunications for domestic use. VSNL is considering joint ventures in these fields with overseas telecommunications groups, among them British Telecom and Cable &amp; Wireless of the UK and AT&amp;T from the US. Mr Syngal said the possibility of an investment by a foreign group in VSNL had been discussed but none was planned. Under government rules, registered financial institutions are the only foreign investors allowed to buy stock in the Indian market and are limited to a maximum holding of 5 per cent.</p>

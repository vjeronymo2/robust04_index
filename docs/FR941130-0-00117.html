L. 103&hyph;382), enacted subsequent to publication of the notice of proposed rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is the practice of the Secretary to offer interested parties the opportunity to comment on proposed regulations in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553. However, since these changes merely incorporate statutory changes into the regulations, public comment could have no effect. Therefore, the Secretary has determined pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B) that public comment on the regulations is unnecessary and contrary to the public interest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12866  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These final regulations have been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12866. Under the terms of the order the Secretary has assessed the potential costs and benefits of this regulatory action. The potential costs associated with these regulations are those resulting from statutory requirements and those determined by the Secretary to be necessary for administering the Title IV, HEA programs effectively and efficiently. In assessing the potential costs and benefits_both quantitative and qualitative_of these proposed regulations, the Secretary has determined that the benefits of these regulations justify the costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary has also determined that this regulatory action does not unduly interfere with State, local, and tribal governments in the exercise of their governmental functions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Assessment of Educational Impact  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the NPRM, the Secretary requested comments on whether the proposed regulations would require transmission of information that is being gathered by, or is available from, any other agency or authority of the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the response to the proposed rules and on its own review, the Department has determined that the regulations in this document do not require transmission of information that is being gathered by, or is available from, any other agency or authority of the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 34 CFR Part 682  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Administrative practice and procedure, Colleges and universities, Education, Loan programs_education, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Student aid, Vocational education.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: November 22, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Richard W.

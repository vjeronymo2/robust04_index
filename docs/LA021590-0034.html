			<p><P> February 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KINGS BLOW 5-2 LEAD, LOSE AT DETROIT;  </P> <P> HOCKEY: THEY SUFFER THIRD CONSECUTIVE LOSS ON TRIP, WHICH ENDS TONIGHT IN  MINNESOTA.  </P> <P> You say your hockey club is going through rough times?  </P> <P> You can't buy a victory?  </P> <P> What do you do?  </P> <P> Call the Kings.  </P> <P> They went to Detroit Wednesday night, where they did wonders for a Red Wing  club languishing at the bottom of the Norris Division.  </P> <P> Against the Kings, Detroit (21-30-7) looked like a Stanley Cup champion. The  Red Wings scored three third-period goals, the last completing a hat trick by  Steve Yzerman, to beat the Kings, 6-5, before a sellout crowd of 19,875 at Joe  Louis Arena .  </P> <P> It was the Kings' fourth consecutive loss, third on this trip. In the last  three, they have been unable to hold a lead in the final period.  </P> <P> In Pittsburgh, they gave up four third-period goals. In Toronto, it was three.  </P> <P> Over the past four games, they have been outscored, 12-2, in the final period  and have given up a total of 23 goals.  </P> <P> "You have a choice," said co-interim coach Cap Raeder. "You can sit and feel  sorry for yourself, or you can get up off your rear end and say, 'Let's go.'  This is no time to feel sorry for yourself."  </P> <P> The winning goal came with 37 seconds to play after King defenseman Larry  Robinson lost the puck to Daniel Shank.  </P> <P> "I looked up," Robinson said, "and one of their players pinched down and took  the puck away from me. Maybe I shouldn't have been going down, but that's all  we've been doing, second-guessing ourselves."  </P> <P> Shank slid the puck to Yzerman, who took one stride and shot from about 15  feet.  </P> <P> "No one had swept the puck out," Yzerman said. "I was behind the play." He  scored by punching the puck through on the short side, past goalie Ron Scott.  </P> <P> "I wasn't really aiming there," Yzerman said. "I just sort of shot it."  </P> <P> It was his 45th goal of the season.  </P> <P> Yzerman's first goal, coming on a power play, tied the score in the first  period after the Kings' Tomas Sandstrom scored his 24th goal of the season.  </P> <P> The Kings, 4-13-2 in 1990, looked as if they would finally have an easy night  against a club they had beaten six consecutive times, outscoring them, 36-13,  in the last five.  </P> <P> The Kings' Wayne Gretzky scored twice, ending a slump that had seen him score  one goal in six games.  </P> <P> His 30th of the season gave the Kings a 2-1 lead. Lee Norwood tied the score  with his eighth goal to close out the first period, but then Dave Taylor (11th  goal), Steve Duchesne (16th) and Gretzky again pushed the Kings into a 5-2  lead.  </P> <P> It could have been more. The Kings were zero of five on the power play, making  them zero of 10 in their past two games.  </P> <P> And they failed to score on a two-man advantage that lasted 1:03.  </P> <P> They were still ahead, 5-2, with a minute left in the second period, but  Gretzky lost the puck. Yzerman got two shots, the second going in.  </P> <P> Then came another third-period collapse. Shawn Burr scored his 19th goal at  5:39 to make the score 5-4.  </P> <P> Then, Sheldon Kennedy picked off Robinson's attempt to clear the puck from the  side of the net. Kennedy passed to Gerard Gallant in the slot. Gallant  responded with his 28th goal at 9:12 to tie the score.  </P> <P> Sandstrom had two assists and Gretzky one to give them each three points, but  both players were more concerned with other numbers, namely 24-28-6, the Kings'  record.  </P> <P> "I wish I had the answers," Robinson said. "It's just very discouraging. Guys  are working their rear ends off, but everything that can and will go wrong  has."  </P> <P> The good news is, the Kings have only one game left on their trip, tonight in  Minnesota.  </P> <P> The bad news is, they will be playing three periods.  </P> <P> King Notes  </P> <P> When informed the point-scoring streak of Pittsburgh Penguin Mario Lemieux had  ended at 46, five shy of his record, Wayne Gretzky said, "It would have been no  problem if he had broken it." When informed Lemieux had left the ice because of  pain in his back from a herniated disk, Gretzky added, "If he lost the streak  because of an injury, that's really frustrating. Being able to play physically,  that's what you have to do."  </P> <P> A decision is expected Tuesday on the availability of Coach Tom Webster. He has  an inner-ear injury, suffered when he fell in the shower in Edmonton Jan. 26.  It's the same type of injury that forced him to resign as coach of the New York  Rangers in 1986. Surgery corrected the original problem. Should surgery again  be required, Webster would probably be unable to return this season. Would  owner Bruce McNall continue the present setup, with assistant coaches Cap  Raeder and Rick Wilson running the club? "That would probably be the best thing  to do," McNall said. "But I have to talk to Rogie (Vachon, general manager) and  to the two assistants to see if they feel comfortable with this setup." McNall  ruled out the possibility of replacing Webster. "We'll hear what the doctors  have to say and go from there, but in any and all cases, firing him is not an  option"  </P> <P> The NHL summoned Winnipeg Jet center Laurie Boschman to a hearing today because  of a high-sticking incident in a game Feb. 8 at the Forum. "I'm not surprised  they're having one," Boschman said. "I guess it looks pretty bad in the films."  Boschman was ejected after coming up behind Tomas Sandstrom in the third period  and running his stick over Sandstrom's helmet shield and into his face. . . .  Both Mikael Lindholm and rookie goalie Robb Stauber have been sent to the  team's minor league team in New Haven.  </P></p>

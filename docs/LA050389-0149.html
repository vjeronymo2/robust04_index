			<p><P> May 3, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> BELL HELICOPTER THREATENS LAYOFFS  </P> <P> Bell Helicopter Textron will begin layoffs next week unless the Pentagon  restores funding for the Osprey V-22 tilt-rotor aircraft, a company spokesman  said today.  </P> <P> In a letter to the Defense Department, Bell said it would halt work on the  program Friday and begin laying off about 2,000 employees beginning Monday.  Bell has been threatening to lay off employees since last week when it became  clear the Osprey was in trouble. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney on Tuesday  announced $10 billion in defense cuts, and among the items eliminated was the  $1.8-million V-22 program.  </P> <P> Funding for the V-22 remains intact through Sept. 30, but in a letter to the  Naval Air Systems Command dated April 28, Bell said it would stop work on the  program Friday and begin layoffs Monday unless the Defense Department comes up  with more money.  </P></p>

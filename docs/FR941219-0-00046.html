			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> DWR (1994) states that Federal and State pumps  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entrain delta smelt. A relationship has been found between the number  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of juvenile delta smelt salvaged at the State and Federal pumps and both  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the percent of inflow diverted and total Delta outflow (DWR 1994).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Whether or not there is a statistical relationship between the number of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> delta smelt entrained at the State and Federal water project pumps and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subsequent delta smelt abundance, water quality (salinity) is essential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the conservation of the delta smelt. Adequate salinity and flow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide the delta smelt with suitable habitat for all life stages, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will transport delta smelt away from major points of entrainment. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Service recognizes and has stated in previous rules that delta smelt are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> taken downstream of the Sacramento-San Joaquin River confluence in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> numerous agricultural, municipal and industrial diversions. Delta smelt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are also taken upstream from the confluence in numerous (over one-thousand) agricultural diversions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 24:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter thought the Montezuma Slough Control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Structure might aid, rather than interfere, with the distribution of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> delta smelt within Suisun Marsh.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based on the best available evidence, the Service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintains that operation of the Montezuma Slough Control Structure may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> result in the destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service is required by section 4(b)(8) of the Act to identify public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or private activities that  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> may <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  result in destruction or adverse  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modification of critical habitat, and does so in the context of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rulemaking. Even though optimal operation of the Montezuma Slough  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Control Structure may provide valuable habitat to delta smelt, its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operation for other purposes may interfere with the distribution of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> delta smelt to spawning and rearing habitat within Suisun Marsh. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effects of the salinity control structure on delta smelt are currently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> being investigated by the DWR, in coordination with the Bureau.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Social Issues  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 25:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Some respondents believe humans are the real endangered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> species, and that neither delta smelt nor any other animal species  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be considered more important than humans. Similarly, one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenter thought humans could survive just fine without delta smelt,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> but could not survive without farmers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Act recognizes that species of fish,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wildlife, and plants are of aesthetic, ecological, educational,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> historical, recreational, and scientific value to the Nation and its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> people (section 2(a)(3)). Delta smelt possess these attributes. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> delta smelt is the only smelt endemic to California and one of only two  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> native estuarine smelt species (the other being longfin smelt) found in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Estuary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purpose of the Act is to protect species in danger of becoming  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extinct in the immediate or foreseeable future. Humans are not in such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> danger. The number of humans has increased in the last century at a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rapid rate. As pointed out in a report submitted by one commenter,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> total farm-related employment (agricultural services, food  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturers, and agricultural chemicals) increased between 1977 and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1989 (Carter and Goldman 1992). Agricultural services provided 89,908  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> jobs in California in 1989, adding some 45,000 jobs and more than 4,000  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agricultural firms in 12 years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 26:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Congressman Gary Condit and several other commenters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> thought the critical habitat proposal failed to account for the human  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> element involved, especially the ``[E]ffect and toil of thousands of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> human hands and hearts to provide healthy and wholesome food for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> United States and throughout the world''.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As required by the Act, the Service has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adequately accounted for the ``human element'' by analyzing the economic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impacts of designating critical habitat for the delta smelt. The draft  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> economic analysis has been revised in response to public comments, in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> response to discussions held at five workshops sponsored by the EPA, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in light of additional research to better portray the economic reality  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the critical habitat designation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / International Company News: By-word for glamour that fewer people can afford / A look at the business difficulties confronting Porsche at the top end of the car market IN spite of Porsche's frequent insistence that there is no reason why it should end up as a subsidiary of BMW, Daimler-Benz or Volkswagen - the three most likely buyers should the troubled German sports car maker be sold - the omens are not positive. Porsche, once a by-word for success and glamour, is encountering serious business difficulties. The car industry worldwide is feeling the effects of recession, but Porsche, at the top end of the market, is more sensitive to the downturn than most. A Porsche has become an extravagance which increasingly few people are able to afford. The scale of the family-owned company's problems was confirmed last week when Porsche announced losses for the year to July of DM65.8m (Dollars 43.20m) compared to a profit of DM17.1m in 1990-91. Turnover fell to DM2.7bn from DM3.1bn, while the number of cars sold during the year slipped to 23,060 from 26,486 and export sales dropped particularly sharply, by 26 per cent to 11,656. Porsche last year sold fewer than half the number of cars sold in the mid-1980s, when demand peaked at just short of 50,000 vehicles a year. Porsche made clear that on all fronts - profits, orders and sales - conditions had deteriorated since the beginning of the business year, and were likely to carry on getting worse. The outlook for the home market is deteriorating as the German economy weakens, while the appreciation of the D-Mark will make it even harder for Porsche to sell abroad. It seems likely that the company will sink further into losses this year, serving to stir up speculation that the Porsche and Piech families which own its ordinary shares and most of the preference shares, will be tempted to sell Porsche outright. Analysts say that there would be considerable industrial logic behind such a move: that Porsche is simply too small to carry on competing in a world dominated by large vehicle manufacturers. Its cars, critics say, are old-fashioned and expensive - especially in competition with Japanese manufacturers who have aggressively targeted the expensive end of the sports car market. However, a sale, according to the company's official statement last Thursday, remains out of the question and Porsche is busily mapping out a strategy to ensure its survival as an independent company. The question of how to respond to the difficult business environment has claimed one victim: the outspoken Mr Arno Bohn, frequently at odds with the families who own the business, stepped down as chief executive at the end of September due to what were cryptically described as differences of opinion over business strategy. Mr Bohn's successor was the less well-known Mr Wendelin Wiedeking, head of production at Porsche until his elevation to the top job. His strategy is to cut Porsche's cost-base by 30 per cent by 1995. To this end, the company is cutting 1,850 jobs during the course of the current business year - almost a quarter of the workforce. It is thought that Mr Wiedeking has drawn up his plans with the view to surviving a worst-case scenario, with sales falling from their depressed levels to fewer than 20,000 units. His background in production means that he is an ideal person to see through a tough rationalisation programme which will focus on production costs. But is he any more than a caretaker chief executive whose job it is to groom Porsche for a sale? If Porsche were a publicly-owned company, it is highly unlikely that it could have remained independent until now. Its strong brand name could well have attracted a buyer irrespective of current difficulties. The large German car companies have made clear that they would be willing buyers should Porsche come up for sale. However, Porsche is privately owned by individuals who do not have to base their investment decisions on short-term profit considerations. Moreover, the Piechs and the Porsches - descendants of the company's founder, Mr Ferdinand Porsche - do not even have to rely on this company as their only source of income. The family owns a car distribution business which is one of Austria's largest private companies. Prominent family members have interesting and remunerative jobs - Mr Ferdinand Piech, for example, is chief executive of VW's Audi subsidiary. Although the family is sufficiently fragmented for there to be different views about the wisdom of a sale, analysts think it unlikely that they would want to sell the company - emotional considerations apart - at a time when they would not get the best price for it. Another consideration is that the company is not in any obvious financial difficulty: it had no debt and net cash of DM600m at the end of its last financial year. This will be eaten into in the months and years ahead, but the cash cushion ensures that a crisis sale is out of the question. The families will probably try to preserve the company's independence until 1995 at the very least, when a new range of sports cars will be introduced. In the meantime, they will keep their fingers crossed, in the hope that the worst case scenario for survival does not turn out to be too optimistic.</p>

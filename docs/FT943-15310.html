			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / Books: War and the heirs of blame WAGES OF GUILT by Ian Buruma Jonathan Cape Pounds 18.99, 330 pages Germany and Japan lost the war but comprehensively won the peace. They are economic giants which dominate much of the world economy. What their erstwhile leaders failed to achieve with force they have since peacefully conquered by commerce. Having once provoked the world's disgust, they now command admiration. Herein lies a vibrant moral. Their success was not of course entirely home-grown. As soon as hostilities were over the Allies needed them in the confrontation with Moscow. Aid and expertise poured in, and neither was burdened by defence spending. Reconstruction at home and help from abroad make a fertile loam for their economies. But this peacetime success story cannot obliterate some ugly facts. Germany's Nazis and Japan's war leaders were responsible for horrific crimes. Unquestionably the greatest was the Nazi attempt to murder Jewry. This endeavour was not matched, in its deliberation and vast industrial scale, by the Japanese. Their crimes, such as the inhuman prison camps, the use of human subjects in experiments, and the Rape of Nanking - six weeks of rape, cruelty and murder in which a quarter of a million Chinese civilians died at the hands of marauding Japanese soldiers - took place on a different scale, and with less cold-blooded efficiency. But what do Germans and Japanese now think about their recent past? Buruma has interviewed, observed and probed, alert both to the hollowness of excuses and the theatricalities of insincere repentance. The result is absorbing and sometimes surprising. Buruma offers non-Germans and non-Japanese an insight into the mentality of the heirs of blame. For the heirs themselves his book should make highly salutary reading, because there are still too many who deny the facts and therefore the guilt, and that is frightening. Buruma exposes them, but at the same time honours those in both countries who face up to the past. And he is not averse to reminding the war's victors of their own crimes, for example at Dresden and Hiroshima. There is a predictable divide between right and left. Liberals and left-wingers in Germany are ridden with horror at what some among their parents' generation did, and at the national culpability for letting it happen. Philosemitism is common among Germans of this persuasion, as a gesture of reparation and conciliation. But attitudes on the further reaches of the political right range from self-exculpation to denial, together with ugly scenes of Nazi-saluting thugs attacking foreigners. So far, at least, the standard view is closer to the former than the latter. One good way of avoiding a repetition of the past is to know it for what it was. Many in Germany have swallowed hard and looked into the mirror; and they have seen that they are the people of Goethe and Beethoven, Belsen and Auschwitz. In Japan, matters are worryingly otherwise. Some plucky left-leaning teachers attempt to breach the official silence about Japanese war crimes by telling students what happened in the prison camps of Manchuria and the streets of Nanking. Notoriously, school histories pass these matters over in silence or a few vague sentences, for the establishment line is that Japan was not the perpetrator but the victim of war crimes: specifically, the atom-bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The former city has become a shrine, built around a vast memorial 'Peace Park'. It is as if the terrible flash over Hiroshima wiped blank the slate of the preceding years, obliterating memories of Manchuria and Pearl Harbour and Japanese soldiers using live Chinese prisoners for bayonet practice. In Buruma's view, all but a brave few among the Japanese try either to justify or forget the wartime past, using the large figleaf of the atom bombings to do so. There is nothing mealy-mouthed about refusing to allow Japan the comfort of forgetfulness. Buruma uncompromisingly reminds us that British bombers flattened Dresden and killed 30,000 citizens in a single air raid of no military value. The American atom bomb attacks were horrific mass murders of civilians. Victors do not get tried for war crimes; had Bomber Harris and the crew of the Enola Gay been indicted, what would have made them different? But the Allies' sins fall far short of Japanese war crimes, and very far short of what the Nazis did. Preventing a recurrence of these evils depends on responsibility for them being accepted in the right quarters. Buruma shows that in this respect, Germany is far ahead of Japan.</p>

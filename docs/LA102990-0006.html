			<p><P> October 29, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHEAP WATER FOR FARMERS  </P> <P> Your article is right on target. We discover that agriculture uses 83% of the  state's water, while representing only 3% of the economy.  </P> <P> Also that four crops -- alfalfa, rice, cotton and irrigated pasture -- use  almost a third of our water, yet represent less than 1% of our economy. And  that if farms could conserve only one-tenth of the water they use, we'd have  enough for all urban use for the next 20 years. My suggestion: Let agribusiness  switch to some less wasteful crops, just as homeowners are asked to switch from  grass lawns to water-saving plants.  </P> <P> JERRY COWLE, Pacific Palisades  </P></p>

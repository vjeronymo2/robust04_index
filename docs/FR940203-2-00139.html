			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Examples of Activities for Local Partnerships  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Two commenters had suggestions regarding the ``Examples of Activities for Local Partnerships'' provided in the notice. One commenter believed that paragraph (f) (redesignated as paragraph (g)) should be changed to specifically allow students with disabilities to participate in graduation assistance programs to help them graduate from high school, continue their education or training, and to find jobs as well as advance in them. The second commenter requested the Secretaries to add the word, ``all,'' before ``at risk and low-achieving students'' in paragraph (f) (redesignated as paragraph (g)). The commenter felt that this change was necessary to ensure that all categories of students listed in the definition of ``All students'' would be served. The commenter also suggested changing the last phrase in paragraph (f) of the October 14, 1993 notice, to read, ``*&blank;*&blank;* and finding, maintaining or advancing in jobs,'' to emphasize that maintaining a job is equally as important as finding one.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretaries agree with commenters that graduation assistance programs should be geared to serving all students, as defined in the notice, and that the activity described in redesignated paragraph (g) should clearly refer to disabled students as well as to at-risk and low-achieving students. The Secretaries also believe that ``maintaining a job'' is consistent with the desired outcomes of the School-to-Work Opportunities initiative and of this competition, and have added the word, ``maintaining'' to redesignated paragraph (g) of the ``Examples of Activities for Local Partnerships.'' The commenter on the availability of occupational information and career development assistance has suggested two, among what may be many, additional worthwhile activities that might be carried out under a local partnership. The Secretaries, because this section is purely illustrative and in the interest of brevity, have elected not to include them in the final priority. Although the Secretaries find commendable, the suggestion to require that all at-risk and low-achieving students be served in a graduation assistance program, the Secretaries fully understand the difference between ``equal access to opportunity'' and a ``guarantee,'' and, because of the limited resources available, have elected to have local partnerships provide ``opportunity for all students'' in preference to a guarantee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The notice has been modified by adding the word, ``disabled'' to redesignated paragraph (g) in the section on ``Examples of Activities for Local Partnerships,'' so that it now reads: ``*&blank;*&blank;* a graduation assistance program to assist at-risk, disabled, and low-achieving students, in graduating from high school. *&blank;*&blank;*.'' In addition, the Secretaries have modified this same paragraph by adding the word ``maintaining'' to the end of the paragraph. Accordingly, the notice now provides, specifically, that funds awarded by States to local partnerships under this competition may be utilized for the purpose of assisting at-risk, disabled, and low-achieving students in graduating from high school, enrolling in postsecondary education or training, and finding, maintaining, or advancing in jobs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter, expressing concern with what he referred to as decisionmakers' access to occupational information, suggested adding two activities to the list of activities for local partnerships. The commenter suggested revising paragraph (h) to specifically authorize the creation of after school, School-to-Work career centers, where students and parents could seek occupational and career information, carry out career exploration, seek guidance regarding career choices or the design of an educational program, or evaluate the educational preparation that students have received to date. The commenter also suggested adding a paragraph to authorize the publication of career information for use by parents and students, in cooperation with the State Occupational Information Coordinating Committee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

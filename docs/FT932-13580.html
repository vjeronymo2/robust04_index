			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Brazilian miner still hungry for cash - State-company's search for private partners STARVED OF new investment funds, Companhia Vale do Rio Doce, Brazil's state-controlled mining company, plans to continue its strategy of forming partnerships to maximise investment while minimising it own cash outlays. The company is capitalising on its mineral rights at already discovered sites to attract private sector investment through partnership deals. A five-year investment plan includes more than Dollars 2bn in new investment in five major projects by CVRD and its partners. Three of these are in the mining sector and two are in forestry and wood pulp production, a growth area for the diversifying company. The mining schemes are all in the northern Amazonian state of Para. One is the resumption of the Alunorte project for the construction of an alumina (aluminium oxide) plant, which was suspended in the mid-1980s. The others are the Salobo project, for the exploitation of a big copper deposit, and the Caulim project, to develop an important kaolin site. Formal approval from the Ministry of Mining and Energy is not needed for the developments. Last year CVRD signed a 'management agreement' with the government that allows it to operate more like a private company, provided that it meets specific targets. Even under that deal, however, CVRD has limited access to investment funds. It has not increased equity capital in more than four years and as a state-owned company it is prevented from securing certain lines of public credit, says Mr Helio Blak, the company's superintendent for development. The joint venture strategy is a way to get around the fact that CVRD's principal shareholder, the state, is unable to consider new investments. The CVRD strategy also reflects an international trend toward joint mining ventures, says Mr Blak. 'This is happening all over the world. . . Everyone wants to dilute his participation in the search for minerals.' The company's approach is to make deals based on its extensive mineral rights, in lieu of laying out scarce capital - witness the Salobo and Caulim projects. 'We found the copper and the kaolin and we are principally entering with the rights,' says Mr Blak. Most of the expected Dollars 765m in new money needed to prepare for copper operations at Salobo will come from CVRD's partner, Morro Velho, a leading Brazilian gold mining company half-owned by Anglo American. The two companies will control equal shares of the venture. The copper deposit is estimated at 1.2bn tonnes. After the installation of a processing plant it should be producing 150,000 tonnes of copper and eight tonnes of gold a year beginning in 1998. The kaolin deposit will be exploited with Caulim da Amazonia, part of Caemi, a Brazilian mining group, which will provide most of the projected Dollars 295m investment. The 220m-tonne reserve should be producing 500,000 tonnes of high quality coating kaolin, used in the production of high quality paper, by 1995. CVRD will retain a 49 per cent share in the joint venture. The Alunorte project will involve Dollars 500m to Dollars 550m of new investment, bringing the total outlay to about Dollars 880m, according to Mr Blak. It envisions the construction of a 1.1m tonnes-a-year plant to produce alumina, the raw material for aluminium smelting. Originally a joint venture between CVRD and a consortium of Japanese companies, the Nippon Amazon Aluminum Company, the plant was 30 per cent finished when work was halted because the foreign associates baulked at further investment eight years ago. Long negotiations were necessary to coax them back. They will be joined by two new partners: Brazil's Companhia Brasileira de Aluminio and Mineracao Rio do Norte. With the alumina operation, CVRD, which mines bauxite (aluminium ore), intends to supply the missing link in its aluminium production.</p>

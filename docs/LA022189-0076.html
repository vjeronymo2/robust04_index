			<p><P> February 21, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DODGER NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> MONEY DOESN'T CHANGE HERSHISER  </P> <P> Above Orel Hershiser's locker in Dodgertown, someone has transformed his No. 55  into matching dollar signs.  </P> <P> "It looks like something (John) Tudor would do," said the Dodgers' $7.9-million  man, who interrupted his first day in camp with a mid-afternoon news  conference, although it was beyond him why anyone would want to talk to him.  </P> <P> "I'm old news," he said Monday.  </P> <P> Right. Using that logic, George Bush became old news, too, the day he was  elected President.  </P> <P> The World's Wealthiest Baseball Player better get used to the fanfare, because  it is as guaranteed as all the zeroes in the contract he signed that he will be  under constant scrutiny, right down to his BVD's -- the brand of underwear,  incidentally, that he is endorsing.  </P> <P> You know how Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda refers to the mound as the hill of  thrills? On Monday, Hershiser ran down his hill of shills -- all the products  that signed him to do endorsements last winter. There's a soft drink tie-in  with a pizza company, and there's a baby shampoo, and athletic shoes, and  baseball gloves, and watches, and import cars, and import copiers. There's also  a computer deal in the works, as well as one for contact lenses.  </P> <P> "I'll make more money in endorsements than I made last year on the field," said  Hershiser, who made $1.1 million in 1988 en route to winning the National  League's Cy Young Award.  </P> <P> But it was a relief, he said, to return to the field Monday, where he threw  lightly for 12 minutes, after enduring a winter of nonstop fawning over his  considerable achievements.  </P> <P> "It's really embarrassing, it really is," he said. "Not what you've  accomplished, but the way people treat you and what happens after you do it.  </P> <P> " . . . I really know, deep down, that I'm not as good as they say I am. They  talk about me as an American hero, the down-to-earth, All-American kid. I cut  myself down internally so I don't start believing it.  </P> <P> "It's kind of a false world. Everybody is complimentary and appreciative, but  when you go through a whole day with everybody complimenting you, it's fun, but  it's not real."  </P> <P> Neither, he said, are the numbers he signed for. "I'm really alienated from the  numbers as far as their worth," he said. "You get over that hump at about a  million.  </P> <P> "All I saw were numbers on a piece of paper, and what other players were  getting."  </P> <P> How to determine the value of a player?  </P> <P> "You're only worth," Hershiser said, "as much as they'll pay you."  </P> <P> And if anyone out there is concerned that his windfall will change him, rest  assured: Hershiser said he doesn't plan to alter his life style. He even claims  to change the diapers of his infant son, Jordan. Skeptical?  </P> <P> "If you wonder if they smell," Hershiser told reporters, "come on over and I'll  give you an exclusive."  </P> <P> Dodger Notes  </P> <P> Willie Randolph, the Dodgers' new second baseman, checked into camp Monday  after a harrowing automobile ride. Randolph, who was driving his wife and four  children here from New Jersey, had his car sideswiped in North Carolina  Saturday during a freak snowstorm there. No one was hurt, Randolph said,  although his car was dented and scratched. . . . The rest of the big-league  roster is scheduled to arrive today, but the club announced that Kirk Gibson  won't get in until late Wednesday night and begin workouts the next day.  Technically, players have until March 1 to report.  </P></p>

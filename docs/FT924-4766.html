			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / Prior-year changes 'rare' in accounts ONLY 5 per cent of British companies made adjustments in the past 12 months to the figures shown in accounts of previous years in spite of the large number of recent accounting changes, a survey by Company Reporting, the Edinburgh-based monitoring service, showed yesterday. The finding raises doubts about the ability of readers of accounts to draw comparisons either with other companies or over time. Prior-year adjustments are made by companies when their financial statements are adjusted as a result of changes to their accounting policies. The proportion doing so has remained roughly unchanged at 5 per cent for the past three years. All but 14 per cent of the adjustments were made as a result of changes in accounting policy. Most adjustments were made for goodwill - the difference between the purchase price of an acquisition and its net book value. Many of these reflected new guidelines from the Urgent Issues Task Force of the Accounting Standards Board. Other common adjustments were made for revenue recognition, interest capitalisation, post-retirement benefits, cost assessment and allocation and corrections to prior-year figures. Company Reporting. 68 Dundas St, Edinburgh EH3 6QZ. Pounds 315 a year.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Direct air links between Melbourne and Japan are  set to be restored. State political reporter Tony Allen says it  follows meetings between Victorian Premier Jeff Kennett and  Australia's international airline, Qantas.    [Begin recording] [Allen] Mr. Kennett declared a personal  black ban on Qantas and Ansett international services to  illustrate his concern at the airlines using Sydney as their  base. Now, after talks with Mr. Kennett, Qantas has announced a  plan for a weekly direct flight to Osaka's new Kansai Airport.    Mr. Kennett said it takes up an unused Ansett right that  expires in November.    [Kennett] And we will support Qantas to get that flight  awarded to Qantas. If that is the case, then we are able then  to establish ourselves and to (?prove) up the value of that  flight. [end recording]    As well, Qantas will add three new flights from Melbourne to  Los Angeles via Auckland from the end of October. Qantas says  it is more expensive to fly from Melbourne than from the Sydney  and Queensland tourist markets, but if the new flights prove a  success, there will be more.</p>

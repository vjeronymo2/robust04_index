			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Business and the Law: Trapped in a time warp - Problems in England's civil justice system Two years ago the English criminal justice system was in crisis following a series of high-profile miscarriages of justice. Now, say senior judges and lawyers, there is a crisis in our civil courts which threatens the future of civil justice. The system is dogged with the twin evils of expense and delay, and the situation is deteriorating. Widespread concern about the problem has already prompted action. Last year the Bar and the Law Society produced a joint report on the future of civil justice which found in England it was trapped in a Dickensian time warp. It found the use of new technology in the civil courts was virtually negligible. Court procedures were technical, inflexible, riddled with rules and often incomprehensible to litigants. The language of the law was littered with archaic and irrelevant jargon. Delay was widespread, leading to ever-increasing costs and frustrating the efficient conduct of commerce and industry. The report made a number of suggestions for radical change, including restructuring the High Court with the creation of more specialised courts such as the commercial court, widespread introduction of new technology, simplified procedures, and greater use of alternative dispute resolution. In addition, Lord Woolf, the law lord, has been asked by Lord Mackay, Lord Chancellor, to look again at the civil justice system and in particular at harmonising the rules governing procedures in the High Court and county courts. Lord Woolf has already floated a number of ideas, such as making a new breed of procedural judges responsible for case management and cost control. Alternatively, he has suggested cases could be handled by teams of judges working together. His final report is not expected for two years. Both the work of Lord Woolf and the ideas of the Bar/Law Society report hold the promise of a brighter future. But without a commitment from the government to modernise the civil justice system, that brighter future may never materialise. It is this uncertainty about the government's commitment that is causing such concern among senior judges and lawyers. At the Bar's annual conference in London last weekend, Mr Robert Seabrook QC, chairman of the Bar, welcomed the appointment of Lord Woolf but then questioned the status of his review. What commitment had the government given to it? What was his agenda? What resources had he been given? And what research was he doing? It seemed clear already, Mr Seabrook said, that no new resources would be made available by the government to implement any recommendations. This, he said, was a very short-sighted approach. Sir Thomas Bingham, Master of the Rolls, suggested that there were three things which needed to be done to tackle 'the serious ills of expense and delay'. The first was the introduction of a computerised case management system giving judges greater control over the various stages of litigation and a greater chance of controlling costs. The second was the introduction of strict time limits on oral argument in court and a corresponding increase in the issues dealt with by written submissions. It was almost 150 years since the US Supreme Court had of necessity first adopted time limits on oral argument, he said. In England the number of civil appeals showed a marked upward trend, and the backlog of appeals increased year by year. Sir Thomas said he was hopeful of an increase in the number of Appeal Court judges, but this on its own was unlikely to contain, let alone reduce, the waiting times for getting appeals heard. Time limits on oral argument could help. His third suggestion was for the greater use of alternative dispute resolution. At present there was little evidence of ADR being used in Britain despite its success elsewhere in cutting the time and expense of business disputes. This neglect of ADR was surprising since England had been a world leader in the analogous field of arbitration, he said. Sir Thomas was unsure of the resource implications of his proposals. If judges were going to spend more time reading documents and less time in court, there might be a need for more judges. But, he said, whatever the net cost to the government, he was sure the 'net result will be a great saving of cost and time to the litigant'. It was left to Sir Nicholas Lyell QC, the attorney general, to put the government position. The crisis faced by the civil courts was the result of a number of trends, he said. The volume of laws had increased dramatically. Thirty years ago there were only two ways of making laws - through Parliament or the courts. Today both the courts and parliament were deeply influenced by Europe and by both the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg and the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. In addition, Brussels had express law-making powers. Sir Nicholas said there had been a huge increase in the amount of disclosure of evidence and information in civil cases, resulting in longer trials. The legal profession had also increased in size. There were now 8,000 practising barristers in England and Wales, an increase of 25 per cent over the last five years. The solicitors' profession had also grown from 34,000 practising solicitors in 1980 to almost 60,000 in 1994. Cases were now taking longer and there were more of them. Taking just applications for judicial review as an example, he said their number had risen from 160 in 1974 to 1,500 in 1987 to 2,800 in 1993. Legal Aid had also grown dramatically. For the first 20 years of the legal aid scheme the total cost of legal aid never exceeded Pounds 10m a year. By 1980 the cost had risen to Pounds 100m, by 1990 to Pounds 1bn, and it was still rising. Five years ago 2.3m people were helped by legal aid. Last year that figure had risen to 3.5m people. At the same time the average cost of each individual action had also risen. Five years ago each action cost Pounds 204. Today the cost was Pounds 350. Sir Nicholas said he was in favour of judges taking a more active role in case management and he saw the benefits of time limits on oral argument. That system worked well at both the European Court of Justice and the Strasbourg Human Rights Court. But at the end of the day, he said, resources were finite and so they had to be put to the best use. He said he sometimes wondered whether, adapting Parkinson's law, the volume of litigation expanded to earn the money which was available for it. There might also be an element of truth in the view that simplifying procedures and making courts more accessible had only encouraged more litigation. The measure of the task facing Lord Woolf is now clearer. The government will support initiatives to cut expense and delay in the civil justice system provided they do not require extra resources. To the extent that proposals, such as computerised case management systems and court-annexed ADR, require extra resources, the money to fund them will have to be found through efficiency savings elsewhere. There are those who believe a modern civil justice system cannot be achieved without the commitment of further resources. If they are right, the crisis facing the civil justice system looks set to continue.</p>

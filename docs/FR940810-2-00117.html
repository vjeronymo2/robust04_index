			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Currently, floor trader contra-side participation currently defaults to the account of the specialist if no step is taken to manually add the participation of a ROT. ROTs are eligible for participation when they have established priority or parity at the execution price. <FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>  Consequently, before contra-side information can be added, the trading crowd has to resolve among itself which floor trader(s) had priority or parity at the execution price. Quite often, several floor traders are on parity, thus requiring keypunch entries for each such trader. The more contra-side participants which must be added to a trade, the more of a delay there is in processing the participant information to the trade and the more the process becomes prone to keypunch errors and additional manual paperwork.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Currently, if one or more ROTs have priority or parity, the order will be split as evenly as possible between all such ROTs and the specialist. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Wheel will automatically include eligible ROTs in AUTO&hyph;X executions and specify how such trades will be split among the specialist and ROTs. The specialist and any signed on ROTs will be listed on the Wheel, and contra-side participation of AUTO&hyph;X orders will then be assigned to them in circular rotation with each ten lot or order (whichever is smaller) constituting an assignment. The specialist receives the first trade of the day in each respective option. Thereafter, the Wheel turns to assign trades to ROTs in an order standardized for that day on a random basis. <FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The first ROT is selected randomly from all ROTs that sign on prior to 9:30 a.m. All other ROTs are prioritized for receipt of orders based on the badge numbers following sequentially the first ROT's badge number. If other ROTs sign on for the 12:30 p.m. session, the priority list is rerandomized for that session. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For example, if specialist S and ROTs R, O, and T are on the Wheel in XYZ option, the first order for 9 contracts is assigned automatically to S. The next order, which is for 25 contracts, is assigned ten each to R and O, and five to T. The third order, for 20 contracts, is assigned ten contracts to S and ten to R. If there are five or more ROTs signed onto the Wheel, the specialist participates in the first trade of the day and thereafter receives every fifth execution. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Exchange believe that the proposed AUTO&hyph;X Wheel and corresponding Advice are intended to facilitate orderly transactions in AUTO&hyph;X, with full trading crowd participation. The sign on/sign off requirements, including the assigned option and Wheel assignment area requirements, are intended to ensure that the ROT is present and actively awaiting AUTO&hyph;X orders in those options in which AUTO&hyph;X executions are to be manually received. <FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Currently, the specialist will only add an ROT as a contra-side participant if the ROT is present and has bid at the execution price. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Phlx believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6 of the Act in general, and in particular, with Section 6(b)(5), <FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>  in that it is designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, as well as to protect investors and the public interest by promoting ROT participation as contra-parties to AUTO&hyph;X trades and reducing opportunities for keypunching errors through increased automation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. &sect;78f(b)(5) (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B.

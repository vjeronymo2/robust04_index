			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Gold price sinks to six-year low GOLD'S TARNISHED image suffered further this week as its priced sagged to the lowest level for six years. A major blow came on Monday when the London bullion market price fell below Dollars 342 a troy ounce, which many traders had seen as the last line of defence. 'It is very worrying,' said Mr Michael Spriggs, analysts at the SG Warburg Securities financial services group. 'Chartists say there is no real support for the price below Dollars 342. The price could go all the way down to Dollars 325 and I can't see what would push it back over Dollars 350 in the near term.' Persistent selling, some of it suspected to be on behalf of an eastern European central bank, pushed the price below Dollars 336 an ounce later in the week, before it was lifted yesterday to Dollars 339.05 an ounce, down Dollars 7.95 on the week, in what one New York dealer described as 'an anaemic rally'. One excuse for the market's weakness was the absence of most Middle Eastern operators during Ramadan, the Islamic fasting month. 'The were no buyers when people began bailing out,' said Mr Wiktor Bielski, analyst at Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken, part of the Banque Indosuez group. 'The price could just keep going down.' The possibility of a 'No' vote in the South African reform referendum acted as a steadying influence on the market in the early part of the week. But the announcement on Wednesday of a big majority in favour of reform was followed by a modest rally in the gold price. For platinum, however, the referendum result was unequivocally bearish. South African mines last year accounted for three-quarters of world platinum supply outside the former eastern bloc countries, and there had been fears that disruption would follow if the vote had gone against further reform. At the London bullion market the platinum price, which had already lost ground, responded with an immediate fall of nearly Dollars 7 to Dollars 349 an ounce and later in the week slipped to Dollars 346.25 an ounce. A substantial rally was staged yesterday, however, and the price was fixed in the afternoon at Dollars 352.35 an ounce, down Dollars 6.65 on balance. Dealers said signs of recovery in the US motor industry were steadying platinum, the main use for which is in exhaust-cleaning catalytic converters. Base metals markets had a quiet week at the London Metal Exchange, the main bright spots being gains for aluminium and lead. Traders attributed cash aluminium's Dollars 15 rise on the week to Dollars 1,297.50 a tonne to US speculative buying. It came despite a continued build-up in LME warehouse stocks of the metal and news from Moscow that the Russian authorities had given way to producers' demands for the scrapping of export duties on aluminium and requirements that part of hard currency export receipts be sold to the Russian central bank. That was 'an indication that the flood gates are about to open again', said Mr Angus MacMillan, research manager at Billiton-Enthoven Metals, part of the Royal Dutch/Shell group. Exports from the former Soviet Union, which were largely responsible for the unprecedented rise in LME aluminium stocks last year, had slowed considerably following the imposition of the duties and the foreign exchange requirements. Lead prices were buoyed by news of a planned 25-day maintenance shut-down at Nuova Samim's smelter at Port Vesme, Sardinia, and continuing production problems at the Treca smelter in Yugoslavia. The cash price ended the week Pounds 9.25 higher at Pounds 307 a tonne. In the nickel market the bullish implications of a strike at Western Mining Corporation's Kambalda mine in Australia were outweighed by concern at talk of fresh Russian deliveries further swelling LME warehouse stocks. The cash price closed yesterday at Dollars 7,375 a tonne, down Dollars 70 on the week. The London Futures and Options Exchange's robusta coffee market made further ground this week in response to improving hopes that Brazil would take a positive role in attempts to revive the International Coffee Organisation's export quota system. It emerged on Wednesday night that the Brazilian coffee industry's private sector - including growers, processors and exporters - had passed to the government proposals for a new international coffee pact with economic clauses. This helped to encourage a rise that left the May futures price Dollars 33 up on the week at Dollars 878 a tonne.  --------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Thursday's close)  --------------------------------- tonnes Aluminium  +10,025 to 1,153,975 Copper        +200 to   303,300 Lead          -850 to   133,475 Nickel        +540 to    25,068 Zinc        +1,025 to   215,300 Tin           -120 to    12,015  ---------------------------------</p>

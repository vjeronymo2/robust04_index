			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / International Company News: Brazil state ore producer advances to Dollars 299.4m profit COMPANHIA Vale do Rio Doce (CVRD), the state-controlled Brazilian mining company and a leading exporter of iron ore, unveiled profits of Dollars 299.4m for 1992, against a 1991 earnings figure of Dollars 251.9m. Net sales were off slightly, to Dollars 2.28bn from Dollars 2.34bn in 1991. This was due to a 4.9 per cent drop in mineral prices, and a 7 per cent decline in sales volume, said Mr Vitor Hallack, director of market relations. He added that positive factors included a reduction in the company's debt, to Dollars 1.18bn from Dollars 1.54bn in 1991, and cuts in personnel expenditures of about Dollars 77m, owing to increased subcontracting of services. Freios Varga, a leading Brazilian auto parts company, posted losses of Dollars 4.4m last year, about half of the Dollars 9.6m it lost in 1991. The company blamed Brazil's economic and political instability, particularly high inflation and high interest rates. Varga, which makes brakes and exports 35 per cent of its production, is completing the reorganisation of an Argentinian subsidiary, Frenos Varga.</p>

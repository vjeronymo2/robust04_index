But studies have established that the percentage of  immune populace in a region is better reflected by the activity  of natural foci than by morbidity indices. Also important is the  immune structure of the population, which indicates the degree  of risk of infection among individual groups, the data for which  cannot be obtained in morbidity analysis, because not all  infected individuals have clinically expressed symptoms. Owing  to that, the researchers here set out to study immune structure  in order to screen individuals at elevated risk in the most  active natural foci. RIA was used to study a total of 9,176  serum samples from individuals over the age of 15. The data  obtained was analyzed for sex, age, and occupation. The  percentage of individuals immune to hemorrhagic fever with renal  syndrome was greater among men than among women, but the  difference was smaller than the difference between men and women  diagnosed with the illness. Among the children, they found,  there were virtually no individuals with immunity. Up to 40  years of age, the percentage of immune individuals grows slowly,  to 11.8 percent from 9.6. Only after 40 does it rise  appreciably, to 16.2 percent. Individuals at higher risk are  foresters, tractor operators, oil workers and prospectors,  livestock breeders, drivers, and builders.

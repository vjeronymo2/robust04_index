			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Greek Alternate Foreign Minister Theodhoros  Pangalos said that the expansion of the European Union [EU] was  a mistake, and warned that it could threaten the EU's ability to  make decisions on its future. Pangalos also warned that the  possible election of an extreme right coalition in Italy, which  would be neofascistic, could cause a big political problem for  Europe. Despite the fact that Pangalos chaired the successful  negotiations for the accession of four new members to the  European Union, he stressed: Now that this is over, now that I  have done my duty, I honestly want to say that this decision was  a mistake.    [Begin recording] [Pangalos] I want to say that the  decision on the expansion of the European Union was wrong and  premature. The European Union should not have proceeded to  assume new responsibilities before the EU's structure was  deepened, before we made substantial institutional and economic  changes, and before we finished implementing the Maastricht  Treaty.

			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / International Company News: Boldly seeking aerospace opportunities - Paul Betts finds McDonnell Douglas cash-rich and back on the acquisition trail McDonnell Douglas is back on the acquisition trail to strengthen its core defence aerospace activities. The US company is also seeking partners in Europe and Asia for its commercial aircraft operations. 'Our improved financial strengths means we can be a buyer again. That was not the case two or three years ago,' Mr John McDonnell, the US group's chairman, said yesterday at the Singapore air show. The group's net profit rose to USDollars 396m last year, from Dollars 79m in 1992, before exceptional items related to a new accounting standard for pension benefits. It expects to continue showing 'strong earnings and positive cashflow' in 1994, said Mr McDonnell. This would enable the largest US defence contractor to seek acquisitions offered by the growing consolidation of the US defence industry. 'We are not planning any diversification, but we are going to explore possible acquisitions to strengthen our aerospace business. If it doesn't fly we are not interested,' Mr McDonnell said. The group would focus on opportunities in the US market because Mr McDonnell believes the time is not yet right to form transnational defence companies. Last week's announcement by President Bill Clinton of a Dollars 6bn order by Saudi Arabia for McDonnell Douglas and Boeing commercial aircraft had also boosted prospects for the company's Douglas commercial aircraft business. The deal would enable Douglas to rebuild its backlog when it has seen its commercial aircraft sales and production nose-dive during the past three years. Douglas produced only 40 commercial aircraft last year. Twin-engine aircraft production alone has slumped from 138 aircraft in 1991 to 20 last year. Despite the sharp drop, the commercial aircraft operations have made money in the past three years, following extensive cost-cutting and restructuring. They showed an operating profit of Dollars 40m last year, down from Dollars 102m in 1992. Mr McDonnell said they would again be cash-positive this year, even though sales were continuing to decline. However, he conceded the company needed to win more orders for 1996. 'If we don't, we will have to cut production rates even further,' he warned. Mr McDonnell said there were two alternative strategies for the commercial aircraft business. The first was to strengthen the company in its existing market segments by developing new derivatives of its 156-seat twin-engine MD80 and MD90 airliners and its 300-seat MD11 three-engine long-range aircraft. 'At present we are pursuing this strategy,' he said. The alternative was an international alliance with partners from Europe and Asia to enable Douglas to develop a broader family of aircraft to compete across the board with Boeing and Airbus. He said the company was in talks with 'a number of potential alliance partners around the world', but declined to name them. The company failed two years ago to forge a partnership with Taiwan Aerospace after much-publicised negotiations involving the possible USDollars 2bn acquisition by Taiwan of a 49 per cent stake in Douglas. 'We learnt our lesson. We are only going to say something this time when we have something to announce,' he said. One potential partner is Alenia, the Italian aerospace company controlled by the Finmeccanica state engineering group. The Italian group confirmed this week it was holding talks with McDonnell Douglas. Reports have indicated it was interested in taking between a 10 and 20 per cent stake in Douglas. As part of its strategy to develop new derivatives of existing commercial aircraft products, Douglas announced yesterday it was introducing an extended-range version of its MD11. This will increase the MD11's current range by 480 nautical miles, to 7,210 nautical miles. The company is also marketing a smaller 100-seat version of the MD90 twin-engine aircraft called the MD95. Mr McDonnell said the group would keep its helicopter activities, which it had considered selling or putting into a joint venture. The helicopter operations were no longer a separate subsidiary but had been successfully integrated into the company's overall structure, Mr McDonnell said. After shedding about 17,000 jobs last year, Mr McDonnell said the big job restructuring was probably over, as long as the company's defence and civil aerospace markets did not continue to decline significantly.</p>

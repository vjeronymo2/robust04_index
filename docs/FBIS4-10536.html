			<p>BFN     [Text] San Jose, 12 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- Costa Rican Foreign  Minister Bernd Niehaus highlighted today the process of  strengthening political, commercial, and cultural relations with  Chile.    Niehaus made this acknowledgment while awarding the Juan  Mora  Fernandez Order, the highest award given by Costa Rica to a  foreign representative, to Chilean Ambassador Benjamin Maluenda,  who is ending his diplomatic term in Costa Rica. Niehaus  underscored "Chile's will to further its close and constant  cooperation with Costa Rica and, especially, the sense of honor  with which it has conducted its foreign policy regarding our  country."    The foreign minister reviewed the deep roots of friendship  that unite both nations "since the dawn of our independence in  1821." He recalled Costa Rica's debt to Chile in the fields of  health, culture, and education. Many Costa Rican nationals have  gone to Chile to study, and, "today, they serve our country with  the knowledge they acquired in that great nation." Niehaus  acknowledged the benefits obtained by Costa Rica "when thousands  of Chilean exiles came to give us their knowledge in  universities, the theater, and other fields of culture. We also  render homage to the Chile that has been returned to its sons,  the Chile that has always been democratic and independent, the  Chile of the quiet heroes who held their heads upright when they  faced despotism, the Chile that gives its word and keeps it, the  Chile that shakes your hand and keeps it firm," the foreign  minister stated.    The Chilean ambassador expressed gratitude for the  distinction and said it marked the wonderful relations between  both countries, which "continually grow stronger to our mutual  benefit." Chile and Costa Rica march on different roads, but  toward a similar destiny of prosperity, democracy, solidarity,  understanding, and firm friendship, the South American diplomat  stated.</p>

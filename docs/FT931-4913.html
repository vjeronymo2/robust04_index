			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / Personal View: The case for conservative economics Norman Lamont will take his ritual stroll next Tuesday through St James's Park and hold his battered Gladstone box aloft on the steps of Number 11. Then, after telling the House of Commons that 'the increases in duty I have just announced will take effect from 6pm today', the chancellor will have enacted a uniquely British ritual for the very last time. For there will never again be a spring Budget. The political theatre of this year's Budget day - to be displaced by a combined Budget and Autumn Statement next November - offers a perfect opportunity for the British government to re-establish its credibility and authority in the financial sphere, by responding to a nation and to markets positively yearning for a clear sense of direction. The last six months have been deeply unhappy ones for the cause of conservative economics in Britain. The country's ignominious retreat from the European exchange rate mechanism on September 16 marked yet another failure to establish a long-term framework of economic discipline, and laid Britain open to acute dangers of short-term pragmatism and wishful thinking so reminiscent of the pre-Thatcher past. Since then, substantial monetary loosening caused by an unplanned devaluation of 20 per cent has been accompanied both by rapid interest rate cuts and by the ballooning of the budget deficit. The one-off opportunity to curb expenditure in the wake of an election victory has almost gone. Optimistic claims about British public-sector finances being hyper-cyclical have been thought to justify the emergence of a Reaganomics-style budget deficit - which the UK's exposed and trade-dependent economy is far less able to sustain than even the US. People forget that Black Wednesday was not a liberation, but a warning of recurrent weaknesses and of the hazards which still face countries unable to establish monetary discipline as the basis of non-inflationary growth. Black Wednesday proved that our original Thatcher agenda of sound money, fiscal rectitude and supply-side reform had not bitten deep enough to consolidate the reversal of Britain's long-term decline. The tragedy is that this had not been secured by earlier entry into the ERM. Black Wednesday was a signal not for 'rejoicing' but for renewing our attack on the underlying problems - still rising real earnings, public spending, persistent regulatory obstacles to growth - in a way that will produce enduring improvement. Consider the figures. The four 'wise men' (of the chancellor's chosen seven) who commit themselves to medium-term projections predicate growth at an average of 2.5 per cent over the next four years. Only in the third year do they see the jobless total falling below 3m (no surprise there; but it is a warning against false prophets). They see inflation breaking through the government's 1 to 4 per cent ceiling in 1995, then rising higher still. They expect the PSBR to remain as high as 4.5 per cent of gross domestic product in 1996-97, even after assuming tax increases of Pounds 4bn to Pounds 8bn over the next two years. By 1995, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, government debt will have returned to its 1979 level of 45 per cent of GDP, compared with only 29 per cent in 1990. Inescapably, we should find ourselves in the immediate run-up to the next election entering another stop-go cycle, with the government forced to slam on the brakes to contain both inflation and borrowing as a matter of urgency. Since we at least have renewed success against inflation, we must consolidate that gain. Only sustained low inflation will offer a credible basis for growth, and only continuous attention to sound public finances, backed by a formal monetary framework, will allow that low inflation to be made permanent. In response to these imperatives, the chancellor does need to raise taxes in the forthcoming Budget. First, because we have to start curbing the fiscal deficit now. Second, because market confidence is so low that only action can give credibility to any commitment to put public finances on a firmer footing. Third, because the prime minister could actually be right in claiming that Britain may lead the Community growth league in the year ahead. Even that expectation could be put at risk if the government was to delay the fiscal action that is already needed to avoid a fatal U-turn three years from now. There is no insuperable difficulty in finding ways to reduce the gap. Start with the radical curbs on public spending or tax subsidies that have so far seemed too difficult: phasing-out of mortgage interest relief or of the lower retirement age for women, for example; or making a reality of the promise to mobilise private finance for infrastructure projects. Then, look for ways of reforming the tax system so as to generate substantial new revenues: broadening the VAT base - at a lower rate; higher green taxes; employees' national insurance contributions - a higher rate or higher up the income scale or both. Spread sensibly, such actions can be rendered acceptable and presented positively. They could, and should, be coupled with measures directed mainly at the labour market, and designed to make as quick and as credible an impact on the dole queue as possible; one can suggest revived, refurbished or extended versions of the Community Programme, the Enterprise Allowance or the Business Expansion Scheme. President Clinton has courageously blazed the trail of deficit reduction, to unexpected popular acclaim. A similarly hard-headed attempt by the British government to explain and address the real problems of our economy is more likely to reap political reward than playing to the gallery and hoping for the best. Displaying the courage of one's convictions worked before. It can work again. The Maastricht miasma which Euro-phobes have imposed upon the Conservative party is sapping the will to face problems, to provide the leadership so urgently necessary. The greatest service the chancellor can perform for his country is to do what is right, not what is popular. So far from 'snuffing out' the incipient recovery, a Budget-based programme of the kind that I have suggested should complement the substantial monetary easing that has already occurred. Just as my 1981 Budget was able to do, it would offer the best prospect of sustained recovery over the longer term. The coming Budget should be used to restore the centrality of conservative economics to the economic policy of the Conservative government. For so long as we are absent from the ERM, we have to summon up our own determined commitment to virtue. Lord Howe of Aberavon was chancellor from 1979-83 and foreign secretary from 1983-89</p>

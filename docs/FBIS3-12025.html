He knows the procedures of  protocol and the details regarding a meeting with ambassadors.    If there is one thing of which Fernando Naranjo, the  incoming  foreign minister, is sure, it is that the world has changed and  the country needs a foreign minister with qualities of  leadership in all areas of foreign policy. "That is my  mission," he said flatly.    The former executive president of the Costa Rican Social  Security Fund (CCSS) and treasury minister has spoken with LA  REPUBLICA in his office at the State University for  Nontraditional Studies (UNED) in Sabanilla de Montes de Oca.    With a characteristic of calm, he began our conversation. He  first explained the main reason why the president selected an  economist as foreign minister.    During the Cold War, he said, diplomacy and politics were  the  main part of foreign policy, adding "today's world is very  different than the past. The future brings us very significant  challenges."    "In addition to maintaining a firm position in defense of  democracy, civil coexistence, and human rights, there is a new  trend to follow," he said. "The mission of foreign policy now  must better respond to the needs of national development."    He announced the Foreign Ministry will become a support  agency, coordinating the work in foreign trade and with  international financial institutions.    According to Naranjo, the exciting thing about his work lies  in the fact he will be a part of the new type of international  diplomacy. "Organizations and agencies are becoming more  flexible. The 1980's were a decade of structural adjustments,  with a highly economized perspective. The 1990's leave these  structures behind to explore with more global ties," he said.    The job will not only be to aid the process of  transformation  in the financial world but also the changes that will arise from  the creation of economic blocs and commercial opening.    To restore the diplomatic corps' role of prominence, Naranjo  said a team of specialists, whose names he did not disclose, was  examining closely the applicants who have been presented so far.    A second group of experts is examining the names of  businessmen, people involved in cultural activities, education,  labor unions, and professional associations who want to occupy  the various foreign mission posts abroad. The sole purpose of  this assignment is to "send only the best."    These efforts are not limited to the area of personnel  selection alone. "I am worried our diplomatic installations  abroad are poorly equipped," he said. "Many do not have a  facsimile machine or a computer, and communications systems are  outdated." The second grand mission will be to procure the  elements the corps will need to do the job properly.    The initial expense for these purchases and the salary  improvements that must be made will come from the cuts to be  made in the payroll. Each mission will have no more than four  members.    The ministry will create the post of "shuttle ambassador"  for  Central Europe and Africa who will visit each country three  times a year.    Regarding payroll distribution, Naranjo said he will make  every effort to ensure if the ambassador is a politician, the  second in command will be a specialist in the economic and trade  fields.  <H5>  For the Leadership </H5>   To reach the goals he has set, Naranjo announced the  creation  of several new institutions. First he will establish the Human  Development Agency. This agency, he explains, will coordinate  more efficiently the international cooperation Costa Rica  receives and will introduce the country as a model to promote  regional democracy and human rights.    The need for the agency emerged because the cooperation  currently received "is very fragmented, as many countries help  us in a variety of sectors. We are going to ask them for more  cooperation but will attempt to concentrate our efforts to  specific geographical areas and to channel the cooperation to  the most depressed places," Naranjo said.    Furthermore, it will help open a front of cooperation with  the remainder of the Central American and Caribbean countries in  areas where the country has advantages, such as in the fields of  education, health, environmental protection regulations, and  telecommunications. "And, of course, in fields where Costa  Rica, due to its tradition, can help other nations, such as any  situation related to the democratic system," Naranjo said.    Concurrently, a documentary center will be established in  San  Jose to gather updated information on Costa Rica's actions in  the international sphere. The Figueres Olsen administration  will also establish a diplomatic department to evaluate the work  done and to help diplomatic missions carry out their assigned  tasks.  <H5>  Without Protocol </H5>   The foreign minister-designate is not ashamed to say he will  be a "sui generis" foreign minister. "Look at the shirt and  pants I am wearing now. They are not very elegant," he said and  smiled when he protested, because he had not been informed a  photographer would be present at the interview. "Surely, [former  congressional president] Rodrigo Madrigal Nieto would disown me  in these clothes," he said.    This Pennsylvania University Ph.D. in economics tells us  unabashedly he will not be a formal foreign minister, rather, a  functional one who will relate foreign policy to the country's  internal needs.    He admits, however, this is a new activity for him, because  he has never been in the diplomatic world before. "This is not  the first time I accept the challenge of working in a field  different to my speciality. In 1976 President Daniel Oduber  appointed me executive president of the CCSS [Costa Rican Social  Security Institute], the country's biggest and most complicated  institution, because it renders health services," he said.    Naranjo was graduated with honors from the University of  Costa Rica and has taught there for 30 years. He said he has  traveled extensively and one thing that particularly caught his  attention was the fact that countries poorer than Costa Rica  have a more professional, better-equipped diplomatic service,  and their foreign policy is more defined. His observations  caused him to think much could be done to further this sector.</p>

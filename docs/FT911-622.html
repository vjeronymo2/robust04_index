			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Observer: Under cover What lesson might be drawn from linking a Pounds 750,000 gift to Cambridge University by Mitsui Marine and Fire Insurance yesterday, with Japanese banks' worldwide expansion in the early 1980s? The answer is that the international financial markets may soon be undergoing the same sort of onslaught from hitherto domestically centred Japanese insurance giants. Mitsui's gift is a complete set of microfilmed publications of the 1868-1912 Meiji period, giving the university the biggest collection of Meiji papers in Europe. But why Mitsui's generosity? Takeru Ishikawa, its chairman, concedes that, while the gift marks his company's change of name from Taisho Marine and Fire, that fact alone conceals the intention behind the name-change. It's a marketing move to heighten the company's identity, not least abroad where it is seeking to broaden its business beyond its existing base in overseas-operating Japanese companies. Will more of its domestic counterparts follow Mitsui into the world arena? Surely, says Ishikawa, although it doesn't necessarily mean renewed downward pressure on already depressed international insurance premium rates. That will depend, for instance, on whether a continued withdrawal of US insurers helps to stabilise premiums. Even so, considering what the Japanese banks did to banking margins when they set out building market share, it's hard to be optimistic.</p>

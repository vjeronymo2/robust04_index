			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Under the patronage of President Hafiz al-Asad,  the Artists Association this evening held a central festival on  the occasion of the First Artists Day in the 8 March Theater in  Damascus.    Sulayman Qaddah, assistant regional secretary of the Arab  Socialist Ba'th Party, deputized for the president. [passage  omitted]    Comrade Sulayman Qaddah delivered a speech on the occasion  in  which he conveyed President Hafiz al-Asad's greetings and  appreciation to the Syrian artists. [passage omitted]    Comrade Qaddah then spoke about Syria's steadfastness and  adherence to pan-Arab rights and firm principles to establish  peace. He explained that Syria fought in honor and is  negotiating in honor, and seeks the just and comprehensive peace  based on the principles of the international legitimacy, the UN  resolutions, and the land-for-peace formula. He said: Within  this context, Syria believes Israel's withdrawal from the Golan  Heights and return to the pre-5 June 1967 borders is a principal  demand and a basic thing that cannot be avoided if peace is to  be established and if security and stability are to prevail in  the region.    He said: Under the historic leadership of its faithful  leader Hafiz al-Asad, Syria rose with the glorious Corrective  Movement to build itself, resist aggression, and struggle  against occupation. It sticks to the pan-Arab facts and the firm  principles. It depends in its steadfastness on the wisdom and  courage of its leader and on its sons' efforts, unity, and  interaction with their country's concerns, as well as their  enthusiasm to develop and bolster their country's prosperity and  stability so that Syria will always enjoy the steadfast pan-Arab  position and the pioneering national role.</p>

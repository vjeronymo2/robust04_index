			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / Survey of the Electricity Industry (6): Energy policy divided - Japan is torn between nuclear commitment and green issues CAUGHT BETWEEN surging demand for electricity and the government's commitment to environmental protection, Japan's electric power producers and the ministry that rules them can see only one panacea: nuclear power. Japan lacks energy resources, so nuclear power generation is vital because otherwise the nation depends on foreign sources and is vulnerable to unpredictable fuel costs. In late February, in Niigata prefecture, the No 2 reactor of Tokyo's regional electric power supplier was shut for six days and restarted at the end of the month after an accident attributed to human failure. Earlier that month, a nasty contretemps at the Mihama Nuclear Power Plant occurred when the day after a minor accident at the plant, local residents received leaflets from the power company declaring the facility accident-proof. While neither incident seems to have caused injuries or contamination outside the plant itself, they may help to revive the agendas of anti-nuclear groups. It has been nearly five years since the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti) began reducing power companies' rates, to pass to consumers the benefits of soaring profits ushered in by the strong yen and cheap oil prices. But then the price of oil went up. In the year ending March 31 1990, pre-tax profits at Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco) fell to Y185bn (Pounds 770.83m) from the previous year's Y275bn-plus, a far cry from 1987, when the company raked in more than Y444bn. Pre-tax profits for the year ending March 31 are estimated at a dismal Y95bn. Add to that the likelihood that the government will slap a tax on petroleum products to cover around 10 per cent of the Dollars 9bn to be provided in support of the allied forces campaign in the Gulf, and things could get even worse. An industry report from Jardine Fleming Securities in late January said: 'Doubling the tax rate could plunge EP (electric power) companies into the red and necessitate a rate hike.' Rate negotiations between the government and the companies occur annually. An increase could be approved this spring, depending on the direction of interest rates and oil prices, the report added. According to Tepco, the company can still make 'reasonable profits' without a rate increase, thanks to Japan's continuing economic expansion and enormous demand from the Tokyo region. Underscoring its long-term resilience are the triple-A ratings assigned to the company's outstanding foreign and domestic bonds (total: around Dollars 11bn), and the high rating of its Y300bn in commercial paper. The Jardine Fleming report noted Tepco's high 71.5 per cent ratio of interest-bearing debt to capitalisation, but added that 'interest rate movements cannot justify all the changes over time in EP company profitability'. Tepco says it will 'overcome' and 'survive' the risks ahead. The company is reducing dependence on oil, while capital outlays for nuclear power plant construction since the 1970s are claimed to have made it less vulnerable to fossil fuel price vagaries. The biggest private sector electric power concern in the world, Tepco is one of nine Japanese regional publicly-held electric power companies which together produced almost 75 per cent of the country's 798,756m kWh of total electric power output in 1989-90. All the regional power companies are dealing with intensifying competition by diversification into such fields as heat supply services, telecommunications and urban development. Tepco used nuclear fuel sources for nearly 30 per cent of its total generation (205bn kWh) in 1989. The company relied on LNG-based generation for 36 per cent of output, while oil dependence was 28 per cent. In the electric power industry as a whole, nuclear powered electricity output accounted for around 23 per cent of total electricity generated in Japan in 1989. The government's fixation on nuclear power generation is not new. The country revved up its first commercially operated nuclear power station in July 1966. The 1970s oil shocks were something of an apocalypse: construction started on no fewer than 22 nuclear plants during the 1980s. At present the country has 38 nuclear power plants with another 13 under construction and several more on the drawing board. Already three other regional electric power companies - Kansai, Kyushu and Hokuriku - generate more than 40 per cent of their total outputs from nuclear sources, while Shikoku Electric Power generates 38 per cent from nuclear. The heavy reliance by the regionals on nuclear-sourced power has made them prime targets for anti-nuclear protesters, who have successfully stalled construction of several new reactors. By 2010, Miti, which regulates and sets strategy for the power companies, intends to double the number of reactors to 78 and boost nuclear power supply to 43 per cent of total electric power generation. While Miti officials claim the anti-nuclear movement has lost momentum since the Chernobyl disaster, the ministry is not taking the opposition threat lightly. It plans a nationwide three-year PR project later this year directed at specific groups, including housewives, teenagers and company employees. The ministry's strategy is to target the moderates, instead of reacting directly to the anti-nuclear movement. The project includes a personal computer-style network that provides information and news on nuclear power in public places and at nuclear plant sites. PC-owners can dial a phone number to access the network and the ministry will monitor public opinion through questionnaires and by telephone. As part of its effort, the ministry is also distributing free about half a million copies of a glossy, 100-page brochure crammed with pictures, diagrams and flow charts. In spite of having to close a reactor at its plant in Fukushima, north of Tokyo, for nearly two years after a breakdown in January 1989, Tepco's current nuclear construction schedule has 'no symptom of delay,' the company says. A shift in Japanese political balance appears to brighten the future of nuclear power generation. The Social Democratic Party of Japan (formerly the Socialist Party), a strong foe of all things nuclear, seems to have squandered the opportunity it gained in elections last year. Amid its disarray, the SDPJ looks incapable of mounting public support to counter the government's nuclear power commitment. But short-term difficulties persist. If this summer is as hot as the last, the industry could blow a fuse. Last July, Tepco met a record surge in power demand by reportedly getting a big kilowatt injection from other regionals and by urging consumption restraints to ward off power cuts. Miti says it is boosting needed transfers of AC from one generating plant to another when shortages occur. In a further effort to take the heat off electric power companies, Miti says it is expanding its policy of offering discounts to big industrial consumers, such as steel, car and chemicals producers, that agree to cut power use during peak demand times. A recent Credit Suisse industry report said 65.7 per cent of the country's total electric power demand (including supplies from independent generators) in 1989 was for commercial and industrial use. The ministry is also trying to curb residential demand that has rocketed owing to the rapid proliferation of home air conditioners.</p>

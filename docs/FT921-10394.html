			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equities slip lower in nervous trading THE UNCERTAINTIES currently overhanging the London stock market increased yesterday and UK equities refused to respond to the strong rise on Wall Street overnight. An erratic session saw the FT-SE Index move through a range of more than 20 points to lose the 2,550 mark in late trading. Once again, trading volume was extremely thin and the trend in the Footsie often reflected sharp movements in a handful of leading stocks. The session opened nervously after rumours of impending political developments were followed by a personal statement from Mr Paddy Ashdown, leader of the UK Liberal Democrats. An early gain of 12.3 on the Footsie quickly evaporated as the March futures contract made a poor start and by mid-session the Index was testing the 2,550 level. The market then rallied but turned back again when Wall Street made an uncertain start to the new trading session, although it showed a further gain of 10 Dow points when London ceased trading. The FT-SE Index closed at 2,547.1 for a net loss on the day of 9.7 points. London now shows a historically high differential of more than 700 points against Wall Street, raising the question of whether the UK market can decouple itself from New York. London remained very cautious towards Wall Street yesterday, turning down smartly when the Dow moved briefly into negative territory in early trading. But the outstanding feature of the market was the low level of business in equities. The Seaq system recorded volume of 491.8m shares compared with 468.8m on Tuesday. Customer, or retail, volume remained weak on Tuesday at Pounds 811.2m, extending the run of poor retail business of the past week. With sterling testing the lower end of its ERM range during the day, the blue chip stocks lacked an overall trend and it was left to specific factors to provide the direction of share prices. Weakness in the US dollar discouraged the overseas earning stocks which often record the bulk of sales in the US currency. At the same time, the persistent worry over inflationary pressures in Germany unsettled the London market. Oil shares were generally easier, led by British Petroleum which reacted to reports in the UK press of boardroom tensions regarding dividend policy, although the company, which announces profits next Thursday, rejected the reports yesterday. ICI, Britain's premier chemical company, improved very modestly after announcing the disposal of its salt interests in the UK. Pharmaceutical stocks held steady, with the exception of Wellcome which fell sharply. 'There are so many uncertainties around now that most fund managers have decided not to bother for the time being,' said the strategist at a leading international house yesterday. The statement from Mr Ashdown was seen as introducing a fresh element ahead of the UK general election which is expected in early-April. While another half point reduction in domestic base rates is widely expected ahead of the election, stock market traders are now resigned to having to wait for this move until Mr Major makes his formal announcement of the date for the general election.</p>

			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / Bid for Channel 5 may be revived TIME WARNER, the world's largest media company, is believed still to be interested in taking a stake in the proposed national Channel 5 channel. The company, with Atlanta-based media group Cox, is waiting for publication of a report on the future of Channel 5 by the Independent Broadcasting Authority next month. Time Warner was a member of Channel 5 Holdings, the only consortium to bid for the franchise last time. The bid was rejected by the ITC in December, partly because Time Warner was only able to confirm part of its investment. Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, had also expressed an interest. But because of cross-media ownership rules it would have been able to take only a 5 per cent stake. The ITC will set out three main options for Channel 5 in next month's report: Similar rules to those advertised last time, a channel capable of reaching about 74 per cent of the UK population. A narrower option based on separate city television stations. The development of digital television.</p>

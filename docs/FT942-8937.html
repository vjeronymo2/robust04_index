			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Hanson's cash flows The return to dividend increases at Hanson has come faster than expected. The conglomerate froze its dividend only last December as gearing levels mounted. On the face of it, the group's financial position has improved since then, but not that dramatically. Gearing at end'March was 69 per cent compared with 86 per cent last September. But disposals brought in Pounds 898m, while share issues - mainly through the exercise of warrants - knocked another Pounds 116m off debt. Operating activities produced a post-tax cash outflow of Pounds 246m. Hanson argues that the underlying position is better. Once one-off cash outflows associated with the Quantum acquisition, the Peabody coal strike and the change in the group's interest payments are taken into account, operating cash inflow was actually Pounds 100m. Moreover, Hanson's highly cyclical businesses have started to pick up and are expected to improve further in the second half. Volumes are going up and price rises can increasingly be made to stick. Hanson says it is prepared to return to the acquisition trail if the right acquisition comes along at the right price. But a sizeable acquisition now would be premature. Investors will probably want first to see operating cash flow covering the increased dividend and gearing below 50 per cent. Still, such a prospect is not far away. The continuing economic recovery should see to cash flow. Meanwhile, the exercise of another tranche of warrants later this year should reduce debt by Pounds 200m with disposals next financial year bringing in perhaps a few hundred million pounds more. By this time next year, Hanson could be ready to leap.</p>

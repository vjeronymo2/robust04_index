			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Text" of interview with President Husni Mubarak by </F> unidentified correspondents from ASHAI SHIMBUM and Ashai  television; place and date not given--first three paragraphs are  MENA introduction]    [Text] Cairo, 18 Apr (MENA) -- President Husni Mubarak has  expressed the belief that an agreement will be reached between  the Palestinians and the Israelis on the implementation of the  Declaration of Principles by the end of April or the first week  of May at the latest, noting that the Israeli withdrawal will  begin immediately after that.    In an interview with the Japanese newspaper ASAHI SHIMBUN  and  Asahi television, President Mubarak said that Palestinian leader  Yasir 'Arafat is still the leader who enjoys the respect of the  Palestinians, and that his leadership has not been shaken. Most  of the Palestinian people respect the leadership of 'Arafat, who  has sacrificed a great deal for the sake of his homeland.    The text of President Mubarak's interview follows:    [ASAHI] Mr. President, the target date for Israel's  withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho on 13 April has passed. What  were the obstacles that have caused this delay, and which party  is to blame for it? Can Your Excellency tell us of any specific  date for the signing of the final agreement?    [Mubarak] The 13th of April has indeed passed, and this is  due to some obstacles in regard to security measures affecting  the Palestinians and the Israelis, particularly on the border  between Gaza and Egypt and between the West Bank and Jordan.  There are some other problems regarding land and how to deal  with crimes that could occur in any of these areas. There were  many problems, but the situation is now improving, and the two  parties are about to solve many of them. I hope that they will  reach agreement by the end of this month or the first week of  May at the latest, and immediately after that the withdrawal  will begin.    Regarding the negotiations, you cannot say that the Israelis  or the Palestinians are responsible for the delay. Both sides  are responsible. Let us be frank. The Israelis have the land  but the Palestinians have nothing. Therefore, concessions must  be made. Problems and obstacles are expected in the  negotiations, but they must continue because they are the only  way to establish peace and to solve the problems. I think that  the two parties are about to reach a settlement on these  problems.    [ASAHI] Mr. President, it appears that Yasir 'Arafat's  leadership of the Palestinians is shaky because of the delay in  implementing the Declaration of Principles. What is your  assessment of his leadership?    [Mubarak] We cannot say that 'Arafat's leadership is shaky.  I can tell you that the assessments of the foreign agencies and  those who do not live in the area are not totally correct.  Sometimes these assessments are wrong because of false  information given the media by some factions that do not want  peace to prevail or for problems to be solved. 'Arafat is still  the leader of the PLO and enjoys the respect of the  Palestinians. You will hear voices here and there. No one can  expect all the Palestinians to agree on 'Arafat's leadership.  There is Hamas and other factions. But the majority of the  people want peace, and respect the leadership of 'Arafat, who  has sacrificed a great deal for the sake of his homeland.    'Arafat is the one who makes the decisions. There is a  council that assists him. He discusses all points with the  council, but he makes the decisions on the basis of the  discussions with the council, the PLO Executive Committee.  Therefore, the man is strong. Had there been another man now, I  do not think it would have been possible to reach a settlement.    [ASAHI] You met recently with Syrian President Hafiz  al-Asad. What is your assessment of President al-Asad's real  intentions regarding the peace process with Israel, what are the  major obstacles hindering peace between Syria and Israel, and  how optimistic are you about making progress in the  Syrian-Israeli peace talks?    [Mubarak] Although the major problem hindering the  Syrian-Israeli negotiations is represented by the lack of  confidence between the two sides, I can frankly say that  President al-Asad wants to reach a peaceful settlement, recover  the Golan Heights, and find a very fair agreement. There is no  way other than negotiations to achieve peace.    Every leader is eager to see peace prevail in his country so  that he can dedicate all his efforts to his people's prosperity  and provide job opportunities for all so the people can have a  chance to live and work in peace. The same thing goes for  Israel. But the lack of confidence I mentioned before raises  some doubts among the Israelis. Through my contacts with both  sides, I can see that both want to reach a peaceful settlement  through negotiations.    Let us be realistic. The Golan Heights must be returned  fully to Syria, otherwise there will be a major obstacle to  peace, not only with Syria, but with all the other parties as  well.    This issue is important, very important. The Syrians will  never agree to sign a peace accord unless they regain their  occupied territories. We did the same thing; we did not  relinquish an inch of our territories. It is not the leaders  who say that; the public urge the leaders not to make any  concessions, not even an inch of land.    [ASAHI] Egypt has played an important role in the Middle  East  peace process. At present, you play a central role in the peace  negotiations. What kind of role is Egypt likely to play to  reach a comprehensive, peaceful settlement in the Middle East?    [Mubarak] We are helping on all fronts. Egypt is a major  state in this region; it is the biggest regional state. It  regained its occupied lands through negotiations, war, more  negotiations, and then the International Court of Justice. We  have much experience in that field and we know how to negotiate.  Negotiations involving land are very difficult and complicated.  We are trying to narrow the differences between the Israelis  and Palestinians, and even between the Israelis and the Syrians  and between the Israelis and the other parties.    As far as the Palestinian problem is concerned, we are  helping the Palestinians, we support the peace process, and we  are trying hard to bring the views of the PLO and the Israeli  Government closer. I believe that what we did brought the  parties together in Oslo and then in Cairo. The parties are  holding negotiations in Cairo at present. I hope these  negotiations will produce an agreement soon.    [ASAHI] The problem of the settlements in the occupied  territories seems to be very hard to solve. How can this  problem be solved in your view?    [Mubarak] This is a very hard and complex question. When the  second framework of the Camp David accord on the Palestinian  problem and settlements was signed, the number of settlements  was 48, all of which were small. There are 180 big settlements  at present. This will be the major obstacle in the coming phase  of negotiations for a comprehensive peace settlement. I hope a  good solution will be found for this problem through  negotiations.    [ASAHI] What kind of solution?    [Mubarak] I cannot speak on behalf of either the  Palestinians  or the Israelis. We will do our utmost to examine the various  options and ideas on both sides with the help of the United  States and others. We will try to narrow the gap between the  two sides to find a solution to this very complex problem.    Had the problem been addressed in 1978 it would have been  much easier. With 48 small settlements, many could have been  removed and settlers could have found some other job. But what  are they going to do now when there are 180 settlements? It is  a major problem, both for the Palestinians and the Israelis.    [ASAHI] What is the Egyptian strategy to expand the peace  process?    [Mubarak] Negotiations are proceeding with the Palestinians  right now over the first phase. Then there will be a timetable  for negotiations on the final status of the occupied  territories. In the meantime, the Israelis are negotiating with  the Syrians on returning the occupied Golan Heights. There are  some small problems with Jordan. I believe that all these  negotiations will eventually reach a final settlement.    [ASAHI] Through Egypt's mediation?    [Mubarak] I told you from the beginning that Egypt is  playing  the role of mediator and that some of Egypt's efforts have not  been publicized. We do not disclose them to the media. Some  parties release certain information that we do not want to  reveal to the media because they might ruin or complicate  negotiations. We are doing our utmost.    [ASAHI] When do you think a comprehensive peace agreement  will be concluded?    [Mubarak] We hope this will happen in 1994. There must be an  agreement with the Syrians, the Palestinians, and all the  parties concerned. I hope so. I am very optimistic.    [ASAHI] What is your assessment of the situation concerning  terrorism?    [Mubarak] Terrorism exists in Egypt just like it does all  over the world. It is everywhere right now.    As far as Egypt is concerned, we ruled out a dialogue with  these criminals--I cannot describe them as Muslims. They have  been criminals since 1981, and in 1992 they started to use force  to kill civilians. The Egyptian police are not accustomed to  killing anyone, except in self-defense. When these criminals  started to attack the police and civilians on the streets here  and there, the police had to be more effective. The police are  responsible to public opinion; they have to safeguard domestic  peace. Therefore, the situation must be under their control.  We have no concerns in this connection. The problem is that  these people are being financed by foreign quarters, probably  Egyptians or persons from other states who used to fight in  Afghanistan. Many of them are in Yemen at present.    [ASAHI] Can you specify the names of these states?    [Mubarak] I have told you that I generally do not reveal all  the information available to me. But everybody knows this all  over the world. Ask the Jordanians and all the states that have  terrorism. Terrorism exists in Turkey, in your country, Japan,  in the United States, Germany, France, Asia, everywhere.    [ASAHI] What is the reason for the sudden postponement of  your visit to Japan?    [Mubarak] It was not sudden. The prime minister resigned and  the government is busy selecting a new prime minister. It is  not proper to visit Japan at such a time; they have not  appointed a prime minister. He might be appointed today; and  the visit was supposed to begin today. I could not have gone  there while the government was experiencing a change. Your  parliament will still have to approve the appointment, probably  on Wednesday. Therefore, I believe that it is difficult. The  public would ask me why I visited Japan when there was no  government there. But relations between Egypt and Japan are  good. The sudden postponement was due to the sudden resignation  of the prime minister.    [ASAHI] Will you visit Japan in the near future?    [Mubarak] Certainly. Once the new government takes over we  will fix another date to visit Japan.    [ASAHI] Do you believe that Japan should play a bigger role  in this region?    [Mubarak] I believe that it has a quite significant role in  this connection. It can at least contribute to the region's  development. I am talking about the occupied territories in our  region, including Syria and all the equally-important states.    That is how we look to Japan. This kind of contribution is  very effective in developing the states that will constitute the  foundation of the modern age after peace has been established.  I believe that Japan is capable of playing a very significant  role in developing this part of the world.    [ASAHI] The Palestinians and Chairman 'Arafat are frustrated  by the delay in implementing the agreement, while the Israelis  are indifferent to that delay. What are your observations on  this difference in positions?    [Mubarak] It is a political game.</p>

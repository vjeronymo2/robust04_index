			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / UK Company News: BT to increase pay-out by 8.3% despite dip in profits BT, Britain's dominant telecommunications group, yesterday announced an 8.3 per cent increase in dividends despite suffering its first drop in profits since privatisation eight years ago. The company also announced that it planned to reduce staff numbers by up to 24,000, or 12 per cent of its workforce, in the current financial year as part of a drive to improve efficiency. Staff numbers were cut by 16,400 last financial year and by 18,900 in the year before that, giving an expected reduction of 60,000 over three years. Pre-tax profits for the year to end-March were Pounds 3.073bn, a marginal decline on the Pounds 3.075bn in the previous financial year. A combination of the recession, growing competition from Mercury Communications and tighter regulation by Oftel, the industry regulator, brought to an end a period of strong and unbroken profits growth. Turnover increased by 1.4 per cent to Pounds 13.3bn. Mr Iain Vallance, chairman, said that 'firm management control of operating costs' had prevented the fall in profits being greater. Mr Michael Hepher, group managing director, said that early responses to the company's new redundancy scheme indicated there would be sufficient volunteers. He also reiterated that the current job cuts were not 'the end of the road'. The company expects the cost of this year's redundancies to be Pounds 400m, of which about Pounds 120m will come from an existing provision for restructuring the organisation. The rest will be charged to the profit and loss account. There will also be an increase of about Pounds 550m in BT's pension liability, although it will not be clear whether this will lead to an end in the company's three-year pension holiday until a revaluation of pension funds is completed in the autumn. BT said its share of the basic telecommunications services market was about 93 per cent and its share of the international calls had fallen to less than 80 per cent. Inland call volumes grew by only 1 per cent while international volumes increased by 4 per cent. Capital expenditure fell to Pounds 2.45bn from Pounds 2.76bn. Cash flow, after capital expenditure and dividends, doubled to Pounds 1.04bn from Pounds 521m. Earnings per share fell 2.2 per cent to 33.2p. The full year dividend is being increased 8.3 per cent to 14.4p.</p>

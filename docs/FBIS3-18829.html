			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Andrew Griffiths: "Shrinking Royal Ordnance </F> Search for Ally"]    [Text] The Royal Ordnance guns, ammunition and armoured  vehicles business which appears set to enter a joint venture  agreement with French state-owned arms makers, Giat, has shrunk  by half in seven years while under the control of British  Aerospace [BAe].    Analysts said yesterday that they are not surprised that BAe  has accelerated its search for alliances. The pressure to  reduce costs brought on by declining defence spending has become  more urgent following the ending last year of an agreement  guaranteeing 80 percent of Ministry of Defence orders for  explosives and propellants.    Against the background of sweeping cuts throughout the  British Army, Royal Ordnance has found it difficult to offset  reduced home demand with export orders, although about 40  percent of the estimated 550m [million] pounds annual sales are  sent abroad.    Last year Royal Ordnance received what is likely to be its  last major order from the Ministry of Defence -- a 200m pound  contract over five years to supply small-arms ammmunition,  cannon and naval gun shells and tank training rounds.    Despite cuts which have reduced the workforce from 12,000 in  1987 to 6,700, including 1,000 in Germany, the company remains  the largest ammunition maker in Europe with estimated operating  profits around 50m pounds.    It also claims to make the greatest range of ammunition in  addition to small arms, artillery systems warheads and rocket  motors.    Redundancies have been a constant feature and trade unions  arguing for diversification into civil markets are certain that  even without European collaboration more of the remaining 11  sites ranging from Bridgwater to Glasgow face closure.    When BAe paid 190m pounds for the business there was intense  speculation that the price did not reflect the true valuations  of what BAe concedes still amounts to "thousands of acres" of  land.    But the vacant Enfield and Waltham Abbey sites in the London  region, which were expected to become development goldmines  remain undeveloped although three-quarters of a 44-acre  Blackburn fuse factory site was sold to Barratt for housing  development.    Analysts say land which has been used for weapons  manufacturing usually requires costly decontamination treatment  before development if it is not to carry the risk of containing  unexploded shells.</p>

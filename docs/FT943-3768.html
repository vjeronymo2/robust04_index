			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / Economic Watch: French inflation stays low French consumer prices were stable for the third month in succession in August, giving an annualised inflation rate of 1.7 per cent, according to Insee, the national statistics office. The figures underline the weakness of inflationary pressures despite a revival in the economy. The French economics ministry has revised its forecast of this year's growth in gross domestic product from 1.4 per cent to 2 per cent. Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, governor of the Bank of France, said last week that the current growth rate does not pose inflationary risks, but he said strict budget deficit reduction policies must be adhered to. The inflation statistics revealed a decline of 0.6 per cent in the index for food prices and a rise of 0.2 per cent in private sector manufactured goods. Slovakia's GDP grew by 5.3 per cent in the second quarter of 1994, the largest quarterly increase since the end of communism five years ago, the Slovak Statistics Bureau said yesterday. The increase compares to a fall of 5.1 per cent in the same period last year and growth of 3.6 per cent in the first quarter this year. Analysts said the pace of growth in the second half is expected to slow.</p>

			<p><P> September 28, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DINGELL SEEKS GENERIC EPILEPSY DRUG TESTS  </P> <P> The congressman who is heading a far-reaching investigation of the Food and  Drug Administration said Wednesday that he has "no confidence" the agency can  ensure the safety of generic drugs used to treat epilepsy and other conditions  requiring precise dosages.  </P> <P> Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Mich.), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce  Committee as well as its oversight and investigations subcommittee, asked the  FDA to increase its scrutiny of the nation's leading generic drugs to include  all epilepsy products and other narrow therapeutic range medications.  </P> <P> Subcommittee investigators said that Dingell's comments signify a major "break  of faith" with the FDA, which has been cooperating with a federal inquiry into  bribery and fraud in the generics industry.  </P> <P> "The compliance people -- the people doing the work in the field -- are fine,"  one subcommittee investigator said. "The real problems," he added, involve the  FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, which handles approval and  regulation of brand-name and generic drugs.  </P> <P> FDA officials refused to comment on Dingell's charges.  </P> <P> But subcommittee investigators, after meeting Wednesday afternoon with FDA  Commissioner Frank E. Young, said that Young "had indicated a favorable  response" to Dingell's request to include the additional generic products among  the drugs it is testing.  </P> <P> "We know that Young has been concerned about these epilepsy drugs for a long  time," the subcommittee staff member said. "He's given many speeches and said  publicly many times that he was concerned about them."  </P> <P> The federal inquiry, which also involves the U.S. attorney in Baltimore, began  with disclosures that chemists in the FDA's generics division had accepted  bribes from industry executives in return for speeding the approval of certain  generic drugs.  </P> <P> So far, federal officials have found no evidence that the generics scandal has  resulted in unsafe products reaching consumers.  </P> <P> But Dingell said that he is especially worried about reports that a generic  company -- Pharmaceutical Basics Inc., of Chicago -- substituted a cheaper raw  material for a more expensive one in carbamazepine, an epilepsy drug.  </P> <P> After the substitution, "breakthrough" seizures were reported by a number of  patients who may not have absorbed enough of the medication. Breakthrough  seizures occur when a patient is on medication designed to prevent them.  </P> <P> At least two patients taking the firm's carbamazepine product died, although no  direct evidence links their deaths to the drug. But a report written by the  FDA's Denver district office and released by the subcommittee said that a  toxicology test of one of the patients showed the level of the drug to be  "subtherapeutic." The drug has since been recalled.  </P> <P> "I regret the additional resource drain this imposes on FDA laboratory  facilities," Dingell wrote in a letter to Young. "However, the demonstrated  failures in the generic drug approval process make essential a review of the  dissolution and potency of sensitive generic drugs currently being marketed."  </P> <P> For most conditions, exact dosages of drugs are not usually necessary. But some  afflictions -- epilepsy, asthma and certain cardiac conditions, for example --  require a precise amount of medication to ensure therapeutic effectiveness.  </P></p>

			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / Forging industry remains sluggish OUTPUT from the forging industry continues to languish in spite of evidence of improvement in the national economy. Executives at the annual meeting of the British Forging Industry Association yesterday reported that after a 9.3 per cent fall in deliveries last year the domestic market remains sluggish while exports will be affected by the downturn on the Continent. The performance of forging companies is a barometer of manufacturing fortunes. Nearly 55 per cent of forgings go to the car, commercial vehicle and tractor sectors. Mr Graham Mackenzie, chief executive of United Engineering Steels, which accounts for about 45 per cent of UK production and exports 40 per cent of its forgings, said the fall in European car sales was 'catastrophic'. He did not expect recovery until 'well into 1994'. He added that difficulties had been compounded in the truck sector by the problems at Leyland Daf, the last volume producer in the UK, although the receiver had resumed production at its Leyland plant. UES production this year is running at a lower level than in 1992, Mr Mackenzie said. Mr David Powis, director-general of the association, meeting in Droitwich, Hereford and Worcester, said export deliveries this year had been stable. Given the amount of orders from both foreign and domestic sources, he expects national output to rise in the middle of the year. The association said total deliveries last year were 158,794 tonnes - less than 59 per cent of 1990's figure. Exports accounted for 18.5 per cent of production. Although executives have been encouraged by the growth in domestic car production, the association said that 'a year of slow recovery, punctuated with occasional setbacks, is the best that can be hoped for in 1993'.</p>

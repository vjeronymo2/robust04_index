			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / Air strike threat cuts little ice in Bosnia A preliminary study of air strikes against Serb targets in the United Nations effort to feed besieged Moslem enclaves in Bosnia was ordered yesterday by Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general. Mr Yasushi Akashi, the new head of UN peacekeeping forces in former Yugoslavia, will today visit Belgrade as part of a mission to investigate prospects for opening the airport in Tuzla, the biggest government enclave, and facilitating the rotation of some 300 Canadian peacekeepers stranded in Srebrenica, a Moslem enclave in eastern Bosnia. At the close of a two-day Nato summit, the 16 member countries issued a joint declaration warning all three warring parties - but the Serbs in particular - that the use of air strikes remained an option. Those impeding UN operations in Srebrenica and Tuzla had to realise that 'force is available' to support relief efforts, said Mr John Major, UK prime minister. Addressing the House of Commons yesterday, he refused, however, to give a firm guarantee that Nato would use force to assist the relief effort in Bosnia. He stressed that UN commanders on the ground would have to give the go-ahead first. But in a familiar response, Bosnian Serb leaders scoffed at the renewed Nato threats, repeating their refusal to allow the opening of Tuzla airport. They indicated, however, they would allow the relief of the Canadians in Srebrenica.</p>

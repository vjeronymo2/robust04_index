			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [By wire dated Urumqi 19 January from Xinhua reporter Xu </F> Jinzhang (5171 6855 4545): "At Press Conference, Abulaidi  Amuderexiti (7093 0008 0171 2251 7093 0008 6757 3583 6007 2251)  and Pan Zhaomin (3382 0340 3046) stated: Joining Hands To Build  a Stable and Prosperous Border Region, the Unity of Xinjiang's  Military and People Have Brought Forth a Completely New Overall  Situation"]    [Text] At a recent press conference, Abulaidi Amuderexiti,  vice chairman of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and Pan  Zhaomin, political commissar of the Xinjiang Military Region,  were highly pleased to announce that the people and the military  of Xinjiang have made it their common mission to build up a  stable and prosperous border region. A new overall situation  will arise, one of mutual respect and support, of bravely  fighting shoulder to shoulder, and of unity between the military  and the political authorities, between the military and the  people, and between the various nationalities.    After reporting on the successes achieved in the economic  construction and other undertakings accomplished in Xinjiang,  Abulaidi Amuderexiti said that Xinjiang's development and  prosperity are the crystallization of the unity which has been  established between military and people and between the various  nationalities. The troops stationed in Xinjiang have made it  their major task to assist this region in the development of its  national economy, in the interest of ensuring social stability  and promoting unity and progress among its nationalities. In  recent years, officers and men of the army have participated in  over 210 major local construction projects, assisted in over 310  public welfare undertakings. On over 1,200 occasions they have  rendered emergency help in calamities, they have voluntarily  planted over 1 million trees, built over 150 schools, and helped  over 80,000 impoverished households in the encampment areas to  extricate themselves from their state of poverty. Officers and  men have dug 1,400 km of canals for people of various  nationality; this expanded and improved the irrigated areas of  land by over 1.4 million mu. The irrigation projects,  named "Military-People-Unity Canal" and "Love-of-People Canal,"  can be found along the northern and southern slopes of the  Tianshan mountain range. The troops also voluntarily dug over  110 wells for the people and laid over 40,000 meters of pipes  for running water supplies, thereby ending for over 120,000  herdsman households their long history of merely relying on snow  and dirty water for much of the time. The various nationalities  of Xinjiang will never forget the meritorious deeds of these  fraternal soldiers, deeds which have been performed in the  interest of Xinjiang's development.    Pan Zhaomin stated that the various nationalities of  Xinjiang  "regarded the troops as a `Great Wall' and looked on soldiers as  if belonging to their own families." Whenever soldiers had to  perform large-scale, arduous tasks, people living nearby would  send some of their own young, strong men as laborers to help  transporting goods and provisions. Governments of all ranks,  though financially hard pressed, would eagerly raise funds to  resolve difficulties that the military may have with regard to  drinking water and electricity, jobs for military dependents,  and schools or child-care centers for their children. Commercial  enterprises and supply and marketing coops of various types, as  well as booksellers, would regularly send mobile units to the  military camps. Border counties/cities and farming and  stockbreeding communities would institute a joint  military-citizenry joint defense system, energetically  cooperating with the troops in assiduously patrolling the area  and protecting the stability of the border region. The entire  autonomous region has over 3,100 family service centers, who  warmheartedly work to dispel anxieties and resolve difficulties  for officers and men on duty guarding the border and for family  members of fallen soldiers. Each kilometer of road, each  military camp, each power station, each water supply engineering  project, all these are the fruit of much painstaking labor of  the peoples of various nationalities.</p>

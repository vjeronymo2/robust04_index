			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / The Trabi splutters off into history THE TRABANT, the unprepossessing little car that west Germans took to their hearts when the opening of the border brought freedom to the east, rolled off the assembly line in Zwickau ((above) for the last time yesterday, writes Andrew Fisher in Frankfurt. The spluttering, polluting Trabi brought thousands of East Germans over the border after travel to the west suddenly became possible in November 1989. Some came to start new lives while others simply came to look. Looking like something a clever mechanic might have run up in his back-yard, the Trabi became an unlikely symbol not only of freedom and hope, but also of east Germany's industrial backwardness. The car lacks style and power. It looks incongruous on west Germany's high-speed autobahns pottering along in the slow lane among the lorries and the dawdlers. With its fibre-glass body and its two-stroke engine, the Trabi is no longer wanted. It was costing too much to make and nobody, especially not east Germans, wanted to buy it any more. But its memory will live on - not least as star of the film 'Go Trabi, Go', a comedy about an east German family who bravely, and successfully, take their Trabi on holiday from grimy Bitterfeld to sunny Naples.</p>

The fabrication of rare earths (15 chemical elements) from  monazite generates residues with low radioactivity. This waste  has been stored for the past twenty years at a specialized site  in the Manche, but it reached saturation capacity in 1991 and  Rhone-Poulenc had three years to find another solution.    The chemical group had considered storing the waste at the  site of a former uranium extracting plant at Ecarpiere (Vendee),  which raised strong local opposition. Lacking authorization for  this site, and with "no storage solution found at the national  level," Rhone-Poulenc is thinking about simply switching to  bastnaesite for its supply.    This substitution implies shutting down the ore  preprocessing  plant at La Rochelle (Charente-Maritime) in September 1994,  involving 65 jobs out of a plant total of 500. The decision  however is not expected to cause any job losses as the employees  will be reassigned at the site.    Rhone-Poulenc is the world's main producer of extracted rare  earths, with 20 percent of the world's volume (36 percent in  terms of value), ahead of the American Molycorp, the Japanese  Santoku, and Chinese manufacturers. The group notably holds 65  percent of the world market for rare earths used in catalytic  converters for automobiles. Rare earths are also used in  luminescent applications (notably television screens),  electronics, and magnetic applications (audio recording heads,  magnets, scanners), and optics.</p>

			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: An upbeat outlook for private investors - Philip Coggan finds that leading fund managers see declining interest rates and increasing economic growth as the keys for 1994 Will 1994 be a good year for private investors? The Weekend FT asked four leading fund managers for their views on prospects for the major stock markets - the UK, US, Japan and Europe. All were fairly optimistic, with the main themes being declining interest rates and an increased pace of economic growth. MICHAEL HART, of Foreign &amp; Colonial 'I am hopeful that the major markets can again make progress in 1994, even after the good rises of 1993. The big question for investors at present is to what extent declining interest rates in Germany will be offset by higher interest rates in the US. The depressed state of the German economy means that interest rates there have further to fall. 'Recently, the US economy has been recovering strongly. If this were to continue, higher rates would be inevitable - and markets are already discounting a 1 per cent increase. However, there are good reasons to believe that US economic growth could moderate soon. Higher taxes are in the pipeline and consumer savings are low, while debt is high. These factors, coupled with a low inflation outlook, may stop interest rates rising much further. 'It is possible that with a favourable interest rate background and improving profits, and dividend prospects based on rationalisation and lower financing costs, the FT-SE 100 index could climb further despite present high valuations. 'For Wall Street, I am concerned that the market has been rising without a 10 per cent setback for the longest period in its history. Inevitably, some bolt from the blue will upset the applecart, if only temporarily. But low interest rates, low inflation and rising profits could see the Dow 5 per cent above present levels at 3,900 by the end of 1994. 'Although share price valuations are high, falling interest rates, good prospects of profits' recovery and the greater enthusiasm of local investors for equities could take the major European markets higher - possibly 15 per cent above present levels. 'At present, confidence is completely lacking in Japan and the market is low  -it could be a good time to buy . . . Japan may be one of the better markets in 1994, with a possible gain of at least 20 per cent. 'In the emerging markets, Mexico and India are probably the best bets, with gains in excess of anything achieveable in the major markets.' TIM THOMAS, of Guinness Flight 'In 1992 and 1993, it was easy to advise what to do with spare cash. Take it out of the building society and put it into any financial asset - bonds or equities - in the UK or overseas. But does that advice still hold true as we enter 1994? 'In my opinion, as regards main-line markets, the answer is yes. But it is possible that markets will reach levels this year which would make them vulnerable to significant setbacks (more like the fall of October 1989 than the crash of 1987). Markets are high but interest rates are low; and with the exception of the US, where we expect rates to start to rise in the first quarter of 1994, are likely to go lower on a world-wide basis. This will keep equity and non-US bond markets rising as investors shift portfolios away from cash. 'Following the sharp rise since the Budget, the UK equity market should put in a steadier performance in 1994, possibly reaching 3,750 on the FT-SE 100, while interest rates fall to 5 per cent. Europe, where the economies have not yet started recovering, should rise 15-20 per cent over the year, with Italy possibly being the best performer. 'Japan should see some hopeful economic signs and this could lift the market substantially; but the currency should slip against the US dollar, although it will enjoy a small rise versus sterling. The Far Eastern markets are likely to continue to attract money as the 'hot' growth area of the world and price/earnings multiples may expand several points, providing 25 per cent-plus returns in local currency and more in sterling terms. 'The US market, with the economy strong and rates starting to rise, may be a relatively poor performer (offering returns of, say, 10 per cent) but should benefit from a resurgent dollar, which could reach Dollars 1.25/Pounds . So, 1994 should be another good year for investors; but, by 1995, the easy money will have been made.' DAVID ROSIER, of Mercury Asset Management 'In 1994, we believe that, for the fourth year in a row, there will be modest overall world economic growth. We expect inflation to remain low and, consequently, believe there is more scope for falls in interest rates. We, therefore, expect further progress in both equity and bond markets. Nevertheless, there will be periodic worries that either growth will abort or that inflationary pressures are emerging. Volatile stock markets are likely. 'There remains further up-side in the UK stock market. In the context of moderate but sustained economic growth and low inflation, the market is attractively valued relative to continental Europe. 'Clearly, the forecast of a lower than anticipated public sector borrowing requirement in the recent Budget benefited gilts. With gilt yields declining, the attraction of equities also increased. However, after its recent progress, it is likely that the UK market will consolidate in the short term until further evidence emerges of a recovery in corporate earnings. 'We would recommend an under-weighting in the United States, where the market will no longer be assisted by interest rate falls. Indeed, interest rates there may edge upwards as the Federal Reserve Board seeks to control the rate of US economic growth, so allowing the dollar to strengthen. 'In Japan, it is probable that corporate profits will show little recovery in 1994, even before major corporate restructuring. We believe the authorities there may not respond sufficiently quickly to avert a further deterioration in the economy. In this situation, yen bonds remain a preferred asset class and there could be some delay in the anticipated weakness of the yen. 'Continental European markets should benefit from further interest rate declines. However, valuations are high and there is scope for disappointment with both economic growth and corporate earnings. 'Finally, we believe that the outstanding growth prospects assisted over the medium term by the recent Gatt agreement will continue to justify investment in the Pacific basin and emerging markets areas. Evidence suggests that investors will want to increase their exposure to them, providing further support.' COLIN McLEAN, of Scottish Value Management 'I think 1994 will confound the pessimists, since growth in the global economy is accelerating and there is little sign of inflationary pressures. Most of the surprises should be favourable - with Japan eventually responding to a massive economic stimulus, and interest rates continuing to fall in continental Europe. The weak oil price gives a further boost to global growth prospects, while underlining the deflationary pressures. 'Lax US monetary policy is feeding dollars into financial assets rather than the real economy. This has been the right policy to pull the US out of recession, but it has also boosted other dollar-based markets, such as south east Asia. 'Even so, liquidity-driven stock markets are not yet a recipe for a repeat of 1987. Indeed, one of 1994's surprises could be that US growth will pick up further - but without the inflationary signals that would require the Fed to tighten. In this environment, US share valuations do not yet seem over-stretched. 'The search for growth should see investors continuing to pile into Far Eastern markets. Not only should the tiger economies perform well, but Japan also has the potential for a rebound. 'It took some time to kick-start the US economy, and so Japan's sluggishness is not surprising. Japan's restructuring will be a long haul, but the present level of the Nikkei under-values the economy's inherent strengths and the likely turnaround in the coming year. 'With unemployment still the major issue in Europe, further interest rate cuts are likely. This prospect should underpin most European markets, such as Germany and Italy. And US money will flow into Europe - attracted by privatisations and the region's potential as a late cycle investment. 'I also believe that UK shares will have a good year, although many more profits warnings will be needed to bridge the gap between the overall outlook of slow growth and optimistic company forecasts. 'The risks are in sectors that seem bargains - such as food retailing - where profits estimates are still too optimistic. 1994 could remind us what an earnings-driven market is like. After easy gains from widespread re-ratings, investment performance is now likely to be driven by earnings surprise.'</p>

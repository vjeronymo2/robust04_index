			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 668.16&blank;Standards of Administrative Capability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In response to public comment, the Secretary has modified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed administrative standards significantly. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary made some changes and clarified implementation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards where commenters pointed out that the Secretary could  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> achieve the same goal by requiring less detail or action by those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions that have demonstrated a history of compliance with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations governing the Title IV, HEA programs and by imposing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more requirements or restrictions on institutions that either  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have no track record or have a record of problems administering  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Title IV, HEA programs. The Secretary removed other sections  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the proposed standards because there was overlap with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsibilities of accrediting agencies or SPREs or duplication  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of other sections of the regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to public comment, &sect;668.16(a) clarifies that an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution must administer the Title IV, HEA programs in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accordance with all the statutory and regulatory provisions, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with any applicable special arrangement, agreement or limitation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entered into under the authority of statutes applicable to Title  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> IV of the HEA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to public comment, &sect;668.16(b)(1) is amended by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adding documented success in administering Title IV, HEA programs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the list of factors the Secretary may consider in determining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whether an individual is capable. The Secretary intends to use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the list of factors in &sect;668.16(b)(2) primarily to assess the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adequacy of staff levels at institutions that apply for initial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participation, change of ownership, or the addition of a location  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or branch campus; institutions that make other changes that have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an impact on the administrative capability of the institution,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such as ceasing to use a financial aid servicer; and institutions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with documented compliance violations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the preamble to the February 28, 1994 NPRM, the Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> solicited comment on the regulation of appropriate staffing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> levels at institutions. In response to public comment, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary does not plan to specifically regulate in this area at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this time. However, &sect;668.16 has been amended to clarify that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary will look at the number and distribution of financial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aid staff when determining if an institution uses an adequate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number of qualified persons to administer the Title IV, HEA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs. The Secretary believes this addition is inherent to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this provision and should be clearly stated. However, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary does not plan to closely scrutinize the number or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distribution of financial aid staff at an institution unless the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary finds other indications that the institution may not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administratively capable due to understaffing or a poor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distribution of staff at the institution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to public comment, use of third-party servicers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is added to the list of factors in &sect;668.16(b)(2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After consideration of public comment, the Secretary agrees  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the burden to an institution of having to prepare written  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures for or written information indicating the nature and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> frequency of communication of pertinent information among all the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> offices that have an impact on the administration of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Title IV, HEA programs outweighs the benefit that this provision  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would provide to the Secretary. Therefore, proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;668.16(b)(4)(i) has been removed from these final regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary also agrees that, unless compliance problems  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relevant to the listed responsibilities are identified,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions may satisfy the requirement in &sect;668.16(b)(4) that an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution have written procedures for or written information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicating the responsibilities of the various offices with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respect to the approval, disbursement, and delivery of Title IV,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HEA program assistance and the preparation and submission of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reports to the Secretary by a general written description of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsibilities of the various offices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to public comment, &sect;668.16(e)(3)(B) is amended  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to clarify that a maximum time frame in which a student must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complete his or her educational program must be no longer than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 150 percent of the published length of the educational program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for full-time students.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This section is also amended to clarify that the time frame  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must be divided into increments  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> of equal size. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretary is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> making this change, as well as the change from previous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations that requires increments to be the lesser of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> academic year or one-half of the length of the program, to make  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clear that no increment can coincide with the length of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maximum time frame.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some institutions have used the previous provision as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> means of avoiding determining satisfactory academic progress for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a student until the student completes his or her program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Increments of the maximum time frame are expected to coincide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with an institution's payment period, however. For example, in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program of one academic year that is structured on a quarter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> basis, the increments would be expected to be the quarters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to public comment, &sect;668.16(f)(3) has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modified to include documentation of a student's social security  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number in the information normally available to an institution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and for which the institution must have a system to identify and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resolve discrepancies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to public comment, &sect;668.16(g) has been amended  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to clarify that an institution must only refer to the Office of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Inspector General of the Department of Education  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> credible <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information indicating fraud and abuse.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

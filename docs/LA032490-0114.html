			<p><P> March 24, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KREMLIN TIGHTENS GRIP ON LITHUANIA;  </P> <P> SECESSION: DIPLOMATS MUST LEAVE. JOURNALISTS ARE BARRED. MOSCOW'S POLICE SPREAD  THROUGHOUT THE REPUBLIC.  </P> <P> Police and prosecutors loyal to Moscow spread throughout Lithuania on Friday  and the leader of the breakaway Baltic republic accused Soviet President  Mikhail S. Gorbachev of waging "psychological war" as the Kremlin bore down  hard to halt Lithuania's bid for independence.  </P> <P> As tensions mounted, the Soviet government ordered U.S. and other foreign  diplomats here to leave, giving two American diplomats now in the city 12 hours  to depart. The diplomats, based at the U.S. Consulate General in Leningrad,  said they would leave as soon as travel arrangements could be made.  </P> <P> Twelve days after Lithuania's legislature voted overwhelmingly for  independence, the Kremlin's grip tightened immensely, with the Soviet Interior  Ministry, which handles law enforcement, beefing up local units and the KGB  recalling reservists for its border guard and dispatching additional troops and  equipment to the frontier.  </P> <P> Before dawn today, a column of almost 100 military vehicles rolled through the  center of the Lithuanian capital, the Associated Press reported. The convoy  moved along the main highway through the heart of Vilnius in the early morning  darkness without stopping, the news service said.  </P> <P> The official news agency Tass spoke direly of the Lithuanian government  provoking "anarchy in all its forms" by its recent actions, and a KGB general  warned of possible North Atlantic Treaty Organization action to exploit the  disorder. Such official talk has frequently been employed by the Kremlin  leadership to prepare the nation for major actions or shifts in policy.  </P> <P> "We are under constant pressure from outside . . . (and) in Lithuania itself,  in the form of a foreign army," Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis  declared. "The size of that army keeps growing. It is openly demonstrating that  it is armed and very strong and ready for anything."  </P> <P> Soviet military helicopters hovered over this city of 579,000 people, dropping  Russian-language leaflets giving the text of a Wednesday directive from  Gorbachev condemning the secession as illegal and decreeing measures to  reassert Moscow's control.  </P> <P> Visa-free travel between Lithuania and neighboring Poland was suspended, and  the Soviet government ordered steps taken to bar entry to journalists and  people "inclined to unlawful actions," effectively increasing the isolation of  this Ireland-sized republic as it faces the might of the Soviet government.  </P> <P> The Interior Ministry, in a dispatch carried by Tass, indicated that units  loyal to Moscow are now deployed throughout Lithuania, from the Polish frontier  to the border with the republics of Byelorussia and Latvia.  </P> <P> "Steps have been taken to strengthen the protection of important federal  installations," the ministry said. "Patrols, stationary posts and mobile  transport inspection groups are operating on all motor-ways, including in  border areas."  </P> <P> The Moscow-based ministry said its officials are overseeing confiscation of  firearms in line with Gorbachev's directive, the first real use of his expanded  powers as Soviet president, a new government post he was elected to last week.  </P> <P> The Interior Ministry said it sent in "groups" of officials but did not reveal  their number or functions. As well as overseeing the nation's fight against  crime, prisons and other police matters, the ministry has its own armed force  of about 340,000 men.  </P> <P> Lt. Gen. Valentin K. Gaponenko of the KGB border guard told Tass that local  reserves have been mobilized to reinforce detachments patrolling the Lithuanian  stretch of the Soviet-Polish border. The Interfax News Agency said a special  squad of senior Soviet prosecutors arrived in Vilnius on Friday.  </P> <P> The sweep of these concerted actions showed Gorbachev's Kremlin moving  resolutely to take command of key sectors while allowing Landsbergis and his  allies, at least for a time, to remain in power, even if their orders will now  go unheeded by many officials.  </P> <P> The Lithuanian president, in his remarks to the republic's Supreme Council, or  Parliament, said the Soviet military was reinforcing local garrisons, as it  moved from economic measures against secession to a show of force.  </P> <P> "We are seeing maneuvers and new units being transferred here, and how they are  demonstrating their arms and their presence," Landsbergis said. "We see this as  part of a psychological war -- a certain kind of psychological warfare is being  waged against Lithuania."  </P> <P> Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene had complained Thursday of increased  activity by the 30,000 Soviet soldiers that she estimated are stationed in the  republic, and demanded an explanation from Gorbachev.  </P> <P> Asked to comment on Landsbergis' charge that new detachments were being sent,  an official in the Soviet Defense Ministry's external relations department in  Moscow said, "We have no such information."  </P> <P> Soviet authorities barred journalists from going to Lithuania on Friday because  "the situation is changing there," a Foreign Ministry official told  representatives of the British news agency Reuters in Moscow on Friday night.  Dozens of foreign correspondents were drawn to Vilnius to cover the republic's  dramatic March 11 independence proclamation and the escalating crisis with  Moscow.  </P> <P> Reporters already in Vilnius were apparently unaffected by the new ruling,  which springs from Gorbachev's directives on Wednesday ordering tighter  controls on who is allowed to enter Lithuania.  </P> <P> The Soviet president also gave Lithuanians seven days to surrender their  firearms, or have them confiscated. On Thursday, he instructed Landsbergis to  stop Lithuanians from signing up for volunteer groups designed to replace the  KGB border guard and Soviet police, and gave him until today to report on what  has been done.  </P> <P> Tass said Friday night that 5,500 firearms had been seized or handed in over  the last two days. However, the Soviet television news program Vremya estimated  that there is a total of about 30,000 firearms registered in the republic.  </P> <P> Scattered acts of defiance were reported Friday. In Kaunas, a reserve  lieutenant colonel who heads the local branch of a paramilitary organization  that prepares young men for the army refused to hand over his arsenal. Military  units intervened to seize 873 firearms and over a half-million cartridges, Tass  said.  </P> <P> In Yonova, 30 paratroopers commanded by a general surrounded a shooting range  and demanded that all weapons be surrendered. The Lithuanians refused, and  negotiations were still going on Friday night, said Edvard Tuskenis of the  government Information Bureau.  </P> <P> Moscow authorities acted in force to oppose decisions taken by the secession  government, with Tass reporting that Lithuania's negation of Soviet laws  "cannot but provoke anarchy in all its forms."  </P> <P> Acting Soviet Prosecutor General Alexei Vasiliev rejected as illegal the  appointment Thursday of a new top prosecutor, noting that the constitution  empowers only the prosecutor general in Moscow to make such an appointment.  Gostelradio, the Soviet broadcasting authority, said Lithuania had no right to  dissolve its local branch.  </P> <P> But the most worrisome comment for average Soviet citizens were those of  Gaponenko, the KGB border guard chief, who said he couldn't rule out the  possibility that "the adversary might use the unstable situation and attempt  some sort of action on the state border of the U.S.S.R."  </P> <P> "In recent days, warships of member countries of NATO have been observed" off  the Lithuanian shore, he told Tass.  </P> <P> The Lithuanian government Information Bureau said in a statement Friday that it  had become increasingly evident that the Soviet Union is preparing to use force  to crush the secession attempt.  </P> <P> "We turn with hope to the nations of the world, governments of nation-states  and all people of goodwill, to request that protests be made against the  possible use of any form of coercion and violence against a peaceful member  state of the world community, Lithuania, and its citizens," said the statement,  which repeated a plea made by Landsbergis.  </P> <P> In the afternoon, helicopters dropping leaflets flew close to the vast,  brightly lit hall where the Supreme Council now meets. Several deputies  chuckled grimly at the din, symbol of Moscow's continuing power over the  would-be independent state.  </P> <P> As control over much of Lithuanian life seemingly slipped through their  fingers, the lawmakers gathered in their gold-toned chamber to choose 18  ministers to take the reins of government. One would be a defense minister, but  without an army.  </P> <P> The legislature was to meet through the night to quiz candidates for the  ministerial jobs and make appointments. Landsbergis said the haste was  necessary so that Lithuania could present a united front and "speak to the  world also in the name of an already confirmed Council of Ministers."  </P> <P> The republican president met Friday night with three Soviet generals to fix the  status of at least 840 young Lithuanian men who have recently deserted from the  Soviet Army.  </P> <P> Schrader, a free-lance journalist, reported from Vilnius, and Times staff  writer Dahlburg reported from Moscow.  </P></p>

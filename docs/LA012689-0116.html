			<p><P> January 26, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIREBALL OVER NORTHWEST BELIEVED TO BE A METEOR  </P> <P> A huge fireball was spotted over northwestern Oregon and southern Washington  Wednesday afternoon, and one expert said it probably was an unusually large  meteor.  </P> <P> A motorcyclist traveling on a coastal highway reported the sighting to the U.S.  Coast Guard about 1:30 p.m. Later, dozens of witnesses called in reports to  radio stations from the coast to south-central Washington.  </P> <P> Bruce Spainhower of the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry said that,  judging from the various descriptions, the fireball was probably a bolide, a  brilliant meteor that appears to explode as it falls through the atmosphere.  Some bolides are large enough that unburned portions of them hit the ground as  meteorites.  </P> <P> Witnesses described the fireball as plainly visible on a bright, sunny  afternoon, and as moving from west to east. Many also reported hearing a sonic  boom after they saw it.  </P> <P> Spainhower said that if descriptions of the size and the trajectory were  accurate, the meteorite may have landed somewhere in eastern Washington.  </P> <P> He said that most meteors -- often called shooting stars -- range in size from  a pea to a walnut and burn up in the air.  </P> <P> Spainhower said that a bolide of such magnitude is very rare, and that anyone  who saw it should call in reports to help scientists determine if it landed,  and where.  </P> <P> Navy Cmdr. Doug Gillies, a spokesman for the U.S. Space Command in Colorado  Springs, Colo., said his agency did not know what the object was.  </P></p>

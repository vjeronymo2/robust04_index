			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Lower provisions help DY Davies cut losses Losses at DY Davies, the USM-quoted architect, were cut from Pounds 1.67m to Pounds 684,000 pre-tax for the 12 months ended April 30. The figures were helped by a reduction in exceptional provisions to Pounds 553,000 (Pounds 950,000) and lower interest costs of Pounds 259,000 (Pounds 287,000). Turnover improved to Pounds 7.36m (Pounds 7.29m) and at the operating level there was a swing from losses of Pounds 430,000 to profits of Pounds 128,000. Losses per share emerged at 11.5p (21.8p). Directors said the industry was still in the grip of recession, construction prices were down, fee bidding was competitive and demand was low.</p>

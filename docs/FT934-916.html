			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Arts: Today's Television In The LSO Sibelius Cycle Colin Davis conducts Rakastava, and then the 4th symphony followed by the 2nd: essence of pine trees and fiords for an hour and three quarters (7.30 Radio 3). If you also happen to admire Tina Turner (it is hard not to, given the way she reconstructed her life after the break from her violent husband, and turned herself into one of the world's most successful solo rock stars) then you can switch to Channel 4 at 9.00 for The Complete Story Of Tina Turner. Best things yet about Ben Elton's apocalyptic environmental thriller Stark are the hippy Vietnam vets Walter and Zimmerman, a couple of 20th century musketeers who seem equally expert on dope and ballistic missile technology. Today's final episode is going to have to be awfully good, though, if it is to save the entire venture (9.25 BBC2). Good to see that the 'Christmas Special' edition of Michael Aitkens' excellent comedy, Waiting For God, is only half an hour as usual: those stretched episodes are usually a disaster (9.30 BBC1).</p>

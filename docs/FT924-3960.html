			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Debts hit Royal Bank of Scotland RECORD bad debt charges of Pounds 401m led to a sharp fall in annual profits at Royal Bank of Scotland. Pre-tax profits at Scotland's biggest bank fell to Pounds 20.9m in the year to September 30, from Pounds 57.7m last year. This was in spite of a rise in profits before provisions to Pounds 469.4m (from Pounds 407.4m). Mr George Matheson, group chief executive, said the bank's attempt to sell Charterhouse, its merchant bank, was 'taking longer than I would have liked'. It has been trying to sell Charterhouse to a consortium of European banks. The results were dominated by a poor performance from the branch banking division, which made a loss of Pounds 10.9m after provisions of Pounds 278.8m. The bank's Scottish branches made a Pounds 49m profit, but branches in England incurred big losses. Direct Line Insurance, the bank's insurance sales subsidiary, and Citizens, its retail bank in New England, contributed to profits. Direct Line made a pre-tax profit before exceptional items of Pounds 15.1m and Citizens a pre-tax profit of Pounds 19.7m The earnings of Mr Peter Wood, Direct Line chief executive, who was paid Pounds 6m in bonuses and Pounds 285,000 basic salary in the year ending September 30, reduced the subsidiary's pre-tax profits from about Pounds 21m for the year. Lord Younger, chairman, said the year was 'dominated by the severity and length of the recession' which had required 'an exceptionally high level of provisions for bad debts'. He predicted another 'difficult' year in 1993, with the provision for bad debts remaining at a high level. The bank's total expenses rose 6 per cent, but its cost to income ratio, a measure of bank productivity, improved to 63.8 per cent (from 65.6 per cent). Staff numbers fell by 800 - or 4 per cent - in UK commercial banking. Lord Younger said the liquidators of Wallace Smith, a small banking group closed last year by the Bank of England, which had previously sued the Royal Bank for Pounds 418m had now disclosed that they would be claiming more than Pounds 108m. Royal Bank has denied any liability for Wallace Smith. An unchanged final dividend of 8.8p per share was paid, although earnings per share were only 1.4p. The bank's risk asset ratio, a measure of the strength of its balance sheet, fell to 10.7 per cent (from 11 per cent) after an issue of Dollars 400m (Pounds 255m) non-cumulative preference shares in the year. Shares rose 7 1/2 p to close at 189p. Lex, Page 22</p>

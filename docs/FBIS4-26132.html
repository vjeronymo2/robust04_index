			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 17 (XINHUA) -- Japanese Prime Minister  Tsutomu Hata said today that Japan has the capability to produce  nuclear weapons and it has not done so because of its  international treaty obligations, the Tokyo news service  reported.    "It's certainly the case that Japan has the capability to  possess nuclear weapons but has not made them," KYODO quoted  Hata as telling Japanese reporters inside the Diet (parliament)  building.    He said Japan has abstained from doing so in line with its  obligations as a non-nuclear state under the nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), KYODO said.    Hata made the comment in connection with an alleged remark  made in a House of Councillors Budget Committee meeting earlier  in the day.    The prime minister was quoted by parliamentarians as having  said he "agrees absolutely" with an interpellator's views that  Japan should confirm to other nations that it can indeed produce  nuclear weapons, though it is refraining from doing so for  political reasons.    The interpellator, opposition Liberal Democratic Party  member  Hiroshi Oki, cited the NPT and Japan's three non-nuclear  principles -- not possessing, manufacturing or introducing  nuclear weapons on its territory.    KYODO said Hata denied to the press at first that he made  the  alleged remark, though Oki insisted that the prime minister  "roundly affirmed" Japan's potential for producing nuclear  weapons.    It is believed to be the first time for the Japanese  Government to publicly acknowledge such potential in the Diet or  public, the news service said.</p>

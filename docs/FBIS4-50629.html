			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 19 May (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- As the  most-favored-nation [MFN] trading status is the foundation of  normal trade between China and the United States, Chinese  Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin said today, we hope that  the United States will make a sensible decision.    At the press conference held today, a reporter asked: U.S.  Secretary of Commerce Ronald Brown recently said that there is  full hope for extension of China's MFN. What is your comment on  this?    Wu Jianmin replied: We have taken note of the remarks made  by a number of American personages recently, calling for  unconditional renewal of China's MFN. This is a positive  development.    Another reporter asked: Will China make further concessions  so that President Clinton can extend China's MFN status?    Wu Jianmin said that the differences between China and the  United States can be discussed through dialogue on equal  footing. If an agreement cannot be reached for the time being,  we can seek common ground while reserving differences. The U.S.  can only do what is permitted by its laws. China can only do  what is permitted by China's laws.    A reporter asked: According to a report, a number of U.S.  House of Representatives members, including Smith, said on 18  May that China has not ceased exporting its prison goods to the  United States. Do you have any comments on this?    Wu replied that the report is a sheer fabrication. On the  question of prison goods export, China and the United States had  already signed the "Memorandum of Understanding on Prohibiting  the Exports and Trading of Prison Products." China strictly  follows the memorandum. Not long ago, the two countries again  signed a statement on cooperation in specific implementation.  Both sides hold that implementation of the two documents is  proceeding quite well. With ulterior motives, some people are  spreading rumors on the issue in an attempt to throw mud at  China.</p>

			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / International Company News: Comalco warns of bleak outlook Comalco, the Australian integrated aluminium producer in which CRA holds a majority interest, said yesterday that it broke even in the first quarter of 1994, with a January loss followed by profits in February and March, writes Nikki Tait. However, Comalco's chairman, Mr John Ralph, warned shareholders that the immediate outlook for the aluminium industry was bleak, with oversupply and high inventories continuing. Most of Comalco's business, he said, was 'still operating in difficult market conditions'. The medium to longer-term outlook was more positive, 'as fundamental demand remains strong with sound growth expected in end-uses such as automobiles and packaging, and increased per capita consumption in Asia'. Mr Ralph later added that the company was considering equity-raising possibilities, but that no decisions had been taken. 'We are looking at all funding alternatives and that includes the possibility of equity,' he said.</p>

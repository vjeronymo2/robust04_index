			<p>BFN     [Text] Nakhichevan, 31 May (TURAN)--On May 2 at 11 o'clock  the leadership of Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic headed by the  Chairman of Supreme Majlis, Namik Gasanov, and Premier,  Shamsaddin Khanbabayev, arrived in Ordubadskiy -- the region  centre of the republic.    The People's Deputy, Khidzhran Kerimli, told TURAN that  several "Ikarus" buses with armed policemen arrived in  Ordubadskiy too. The same source reports that President Aliyev  issued a decree concerning the removal of the head of Executive  Power of Ordubadskiy, Rovshan Shafiyev (supporter of Elchibey),  from his duties.    Having known about the authorities' intention, Ordubadskiy's  citizens began to picket the building of Executive Power and  they protested against President Aliyev's resolution. The talks  between Nakhichevan's leadership and local authorities lasted  for 8 hours but were failure. The population and Nakhichevan's  powers did not agree to fulfill President Aliyev's resolution.  After that the leadership of Autonomous Republic and policemen  left Ordubadskiy.    As is known, Ordubadskiy's region of Nakhchivan is the only  region in Azerbaijan where Abulfaz Elchibey's supporters hold  several offices. After June events last summer Elchibey  together with its supporters left Baku and arrived at the  village of Keleki of Ordubadskiy region where he lives until  now. Since that time Baku several times attempted to remove the  head of Executive power of Ordubadskiy from his duties but those  attempts failed.</p>

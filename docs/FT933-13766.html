			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Labour motions back union vote MR JOHN SMITH, the Labour leader, cannot necessarily count on the support of many constituency parties in his battle with the unions over their links with the party, judging by the motions tabled for Labour's annual conference. Almost 30 local parties have put down motions calling for the unions to retain a voice in the selection of parliamentary candidates and the election of the party leader. Only six have tabled motions giving clear support to the leadership's plans for one member, one vote in party elections. Although most constituency parties have decided not to put down motions on this question, the proportion against the leadership's proposals out of those which have tabled motions will be a warning to the party leadership. The support of the constituency parties is critically important to the leadership in promoting the changes, both for the votes they cast and also for the pressure on the unions that would be created by overwhelming support from party members for change. Earlier this week, the Labour group reviewing links with the unions backed Mr Smith's insistence that only full party members should vote in the selection of parliamentary candidates. Labour-supporting trade unionists would have to pay a reduced membership fee, in addition to the political levy, to become members. Private View, Weekend XX</p>

The  revenues and expenditures of the National Treasury will amount  to $88.8 billion. Planning Ministry Executive Secretary Raul  Jungman said that the measures will come into force only if  approved by Congress. "Lawmakers are also responsible for the  stabilization of the economy, and they will have to decide  whether we will have a balanced budget, without a deficit." The  total budget, including debt rescheduling, amounts to $280  billion.    The strict budget proposal establishes that in 1994  government spending will not surpass revenues, and that public  debt certificates will be issued only for rescheduling the  existing domestic and foreign debts. Economist Edmar Bacha, who  is a special adviser to Finance Minister Fernando Henrique  Cardoso, said that the budgetary balance is the cornerstone for  implementation of the second and third stages of the economic  stabilization program, which involves adoption of the URV [Real  Value Unit] and its transformation into a strong currency. "We  are getting rid of the need to balance the budget through  inflation and corruption. We are exchanging that for  negotiation, which is the only alternative we have, because the  other would be a dictatorship."    In the new budget bill the government provided for a real  interest rate of 15 percent for 1994, because no new debts will  be contracted. This will help reduce payment of interest, which  will drop from $8.7 billion in 1993 to $7.7 billion in 1994.</p>

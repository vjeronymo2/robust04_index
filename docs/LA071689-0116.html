			<p><P> July 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUNG'S WARNING TO WEIMAR  </P> <P> I was appalled at the innuendo and falsity in Russell Jacoby's characterization  of Jung and Jungians in the course of his review of Jerome Bernstein's "Power  and Politics" (Book Review, July 2). First, Jung read the Zurich newspaper  every day, and had frequent and lengthy commentaries about the state of  political realities throughout his writings. Second, the old canard linking  Jung to Nazi sympathies was cleverly put forth in Jacoby's review, but just as  mistaken and offensive.  </P> <P> Jung did not believe that the "Jewish psyche" was inferior. He did not focus  his psychology on "the creative Aryan unconscious" and in fact fought the  Nazification of the psychological society of which he was president until he  resigned. His numerous warnings about the collective psychosis that seized the  German people were made before many people saw clearly into the nature of the  madness that it was. His whole psychology could be said to be a way of becoming  more individual, and thus less susceptible to totalitarianism and mass  hysteria. Jung did not glimpse an ecstatic Wotan (a Germanic god) to be  celebrated when he looked at Nazism. He saw civilization as a thin veneer over  more primitive and destructive gods in the German psyche that were not brought  to consciousness and integrated in psychologically responsible ways.  </P> <P> If Jung were as Jacoby portrays him to have been, why were so many of his most  creative followers, including the late senior analyst in Los Angeles, James  Kirsch, Jewish? The problem with Jacoby's attack on Jung is that the false  connection, the exasperating lie, is left in the residue of memory after the  charges have been answered.  </P> <P> DAVID DeBUS  </P> <P> LA JOLLA  </P></p>

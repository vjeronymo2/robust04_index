According to Glukhikh, one hundred joint projects in the  field of basic and applied research, development, production and  marketing are already being implemented. Recently a memorandum  of mutual understanding was signed with the U.S. National  Aeronautics and Space Administration which promises to become  one of the major joint projects. It sets the parameters for  joint basic research in aeronautics which will be implemented  with the help of the potential, technical capacities and  intellectual resources of both Russia and the United States.    We developed and produced arms separately but are now  looking  for sensible and ecologically clean methods of eliminating them,  Glukhikh stressed.    Moreover, we have thrown open the doors of "closed"  factories  and research institutes to demonstrate our readiness to  cooperate in the technological fields in which Russia's priority  is beyond doubt. It is not accidental therefore that recognised  American industrial leaders such as the Boeing, Pratt and  Whitney, Hughes and Rockwell international corporations are  among our present partners.    We have already passed over to the American side packages of  proposals relating to conversion and involving enterprises in  practically all defence industries. We would like to hope that  the upcoming visit of President Bill Clinton to Russia will  further boost Russian-American contacts in the field of research  and industrial cooperation, Viktor Glukhikh said.</p>

			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / EU roadblock on Greek infrastructure plans: Brussels is holding back funding until Athens can convince it that the money will be spent wisely The six-lane highway that shrinks abruptly into a country lane is both a familiar feature of the Greek landscape and an unpleasant reminder of the financial and administrative muddle that hinders successive governments' attempts at infrastructure improvement. Things were supposed to change with the launch this year of the European Union's new structural package, intended to help poorer member states like Greece move towards the Maastricht targets for economic convergence. However, the European Commission has placed a temporary block on disbursement of Ecu4bn (Pounds 3.14bn) of Greece's share of the funding, which amounts to Ecu14bn by the year 2000. The block covers nine large programmes for motorways, ports and other transport projects. A Commission official said Greece's public works ministry had failed to convince Brussels that it had implemented reforms needed to ensure the money would be wisely spent. These include modernisation of costing procedures, improved efficiency and the establishment of special independent agencies to manage large and complex projects. The funding delay is worrying Greece's economic planners as the EU package is seen as crucial to stimulating economic recovery after three years in which growth in gross domestic product has stagnated at around 1 per cent. Among the projects due to get under way by the end of 1994 are an Ecu450m suspension bridge across the Corinth Gulf, a Dr120bn (Pounds 320m) underground railway for the northern city of Thessaloniki and a Dollars 1.6bn (Pounds 1bn) new airport for Athens. All had been stuck at the planning stage for more than a decade, mainly because of chronic constraints on the public investment budget. While the three projects contain an element of self-financing, they are also eligible for substantial EU grants as well as soft loans from the European Investment Bank. The EU structural funds will also cover up to 80 per cent of the cost of completing the 600km Egnatia highway from Greece's western coast to the border with Turkey, as well as that of upgrading the 580km north-south highway from Athens to the Macedonian border to international motorway standard. As a result of the Commission's block on the funding, only one contract of any size has been signed: an Ecu40.2m project for a British-Greek joint venture to build a seabed tunnel between the western Greek ports of Aktion and Preveza. The Commission has also warned the government that its efforts to change the terms of the Athens airport project risk violating EU rules on tendering procedures. The project was awarded last year to Hochtief of Germany but no contract was signed. Meanwhile, the government has resumed negotiations with Societe Auxiliaire d'Entreprises de France, the losing bidder. The Thessaloniki underground railway project is also in trouble. Macedonian Metro, a Greek-led consortium, challenged the public works ministry in court last month after its financing arrangements were rejected by a ministry committee as insecure. To back their legal protest, consortium officials made public copies of letters from the EIB, the German state-owned development bank Kreditanstalt fur Wideraufbau (KFW) and Citibank, offering loans equivalent to more than Dr120bn (Pounds 320m). The alarm had already been triggered in Brussels by a succession of bids from Greece's small and fiercely competitive construction companies for EU-financed highway and harbour contracts valued at more than Dr150bn. Some were offering discounts of up to 80 per cent of the tender price. 'Discounts are in order because of the ministry's old-fashioned costing procedures, which don't take account of the productivity of modern equipment,' said a Greek banker. 'But anything over 40 to 50 per cent suggests the company might not be able to fulfil the project specifications.' A public works ministry official said negotiations were under way with contractors to come up with 'more realistic' offers to avoid the delay that would be caused by cancelling the tenders and calling for new bids. The ministry said it had started to modernise costing procedures dating from the 1960s. It was also committed to improving efficiency by raising to Dr25bn the present Dr5bn limit on the value of a project that can be undertaken by a single Greek company. 'The ceiling has meant delays and poor quality construction, particularly in highway building, where small segments of a few kilometres each are parcelled out among different contractors,' said an Athens-based financial consultant. Yet Greece's problems with the Commission over the new funding package go deeper. Contractors and consultants agree the government's political commitment to reform is not in doubt, but note there is strong resistence among officials at the public works ministry to reducing their control over infrastructure projects. The need for radical change is underlined by the ministry's lack of adequate expertise to handle technical studies for big construction projects in areas such as geological and environmental impact surveys. Moreover, the Commission's determination to extract maximum value from the new funding package means there is increased pressure to improve controls on costs and ensure the quality of construction is effectively monitored. However, the ministry has not yet agreed to the establishment of special agencies, to be staffed mainly from the private sector and other government departments, to manage large and complex projects on an independent basis. Among other things, these would contribute much-needed expertise on financing arrangements for partly self-financed projects.</p>

It said its survey of 234 surgeons in all areas of the  country found widespread reductions in routine operations and  cuts in the number of out-patients being seen.    The same happened a year ago. "None of the contract-related  financial problems of last year appears to have been resolved,"  the college said.    The survey found that general surgery was worst affected,  with 30 percent of hospitals slowing down operations, followed  by orthopaedics (26 percent), urology (26) and ear, nose and  throat treatment (12).    As a result, the number of patients waiting for treatment  has  increased in more than half of all general surgical departments  and in four out of 10 orthopaedic departments. The survey  confirmed previous findings that hospitals are increasingly  giving preference to patients referred by fund-holding GP's, who  have the money to pay for their treatment.    Some had also been told to treat more "extra-contractual  referrals" -- patients sent by other health districts which had  agreed to pay the cost.    Prof. Norman Browse, professor of surgery at St Thomas'  Hospital and president of the Royal College of Surgeons, said  the college considered that patients should be treated according  to clinical priority, not financial criteria.    The Health Department said that health authorities had to  decide the priorities in allocating cash between primary care,  non-urgent surgery and community care.    "There is an extra &pound;1.6 billion available for health  care  next year and we would like to see doctors more involved in the  process of deciding those priorities."</p>

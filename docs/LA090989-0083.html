			<p><P> September 9, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHRIMPER BLOCKADE FAILS IN LOUISIANA  </P> <P> The newly reinstated rule requiring Gulf Coast shrimpers to put turtle-escape  doors on their nets drew scattered protests Friday, including an apparently  unsuccessful blockade in Louisiana waters.  </P> <P> Critics complain that too much of the catch escapes with the endangered turtles  because they must use so-called turtle excluder devices (TEDs).  </P> <P> Shrimpers in Louisiana set up a 30-boat blockade of a shipping channel Friday  morning, Coast Guard officials said, but ships were able to navigate around  them.  </P></p>

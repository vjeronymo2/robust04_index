			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Kaiser averts Ghana smelter shutdown Ghanaian power authorities and Kaiser Aluminium Company have averted a total shutdown of Kaiser's big Volta River valley smelter while negotiations over the company's access to cheap hydropower in the region continue. In an agreement announced yesterday, Kaiser will close one of the smelter's potlines, or about 40,000 tonnes of annual capacity, tomorrow. Depending on conditions, another 20,000 tonnes of capacity could be shut by year-end. This would reduce the Ghanaian smelter's annual production to about 80,000 tonnes. Kaiser, responding to low water levels, trimmed about 30 per cent of the smelter's output last spring. A prolonged drought in Ghana has lowered water levels in the Volta Lake region, and caused the Volta River Authority to notify Kaiser earlier this month that it would be forced to cut off power to the smelter on September 10. The smelter produces 200,000 tonnes of aluminium a year when operating at full capacity. Kaiser appealed against the decision, saying that the action was premature. The company maintained that lake levels had begun to rise, and that the country's rainy season had not ended. 'We have agreed to talk with officials at the Volta River Authority in late October to reassess the situation,' said Mr Scott Lamb, a Kaiser spokesman. 'At that time we will review the rainfall situation, discuss compensation due the company for the curtailment, and explore other matters related to the power contract.' In addition to the smelter, the Volta River Authority must meet the electricity needs of local residents and small industrial concerns.</p>

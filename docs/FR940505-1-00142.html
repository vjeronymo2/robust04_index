			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Individual airlines will determine their compliance with these basin-wide performance targets by calculating their annual pounds-per-PEU performance using the following formula: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 --> Performance result (lbs/PEU)=actual seasonal emissions (lbs)/actual seasonal activity (PEUs) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This performance will be compared against the basin-wide targets to determine compliance; non-compliant airlines will pay an emissions fee proportional to their excess emissions, as discussed in greater detail below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> PEUs will reflect both the actual number of passengers carried and the actual tonnage of cargo transported on commercial airlines. EPA will establish in the final FIP a conversion factor for combining passenger and freight movement into a single PEU total. The airlines have reported using as a ``rule of thumb'' 200 pounds of payload for each passenger, which includes the weight of the passenger and his or her luggage. EPA proposes to use this conversion factor of 200 lbs/passenger to convert cargo weight into PEUs. EPA requests comment on whether this is an appropriate and equitable value. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA will develop a forecast of control area airline PEU activity for the control period (2001&hyph;2005) to develop each year's environmental performance targets. EPA proposes today to use currently available activity projections for the South Coast from the South Coast Air Quality Management District for this purpose. Similar existing projections will be used for Ventura and Sacramento, as discussed in the Technical Support Document. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Certain discrepancies may arise, however, between current forecasts and actual activity some years in the future. If actual PEU activity is higher than EPA forecast, compliance with the annual pounds-per-PEU level could result in total emissions higher than the basin-wide targets. If actual activity is lower than EPA forecast, the promulgated pounds-per-PEU limit will be more restrictive than actually needed. For that reason EPA will periodically review the PEU forecast, given its importance in establishing the environmental performance targets. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This review will occur approximately every three to five years at a minimum. EPA will revise the area-wide PEU forecast in a subsequent rulemaking action if the periodic review indicates that the forecast is significantly inaccurate. EPA also will revise the seasonal environmental performance pounds-per-PEU targets in the same rulemaking action in the event that the PEU forecast is revised. EPA also requests comment on alternative methods for establishing activity factors (and the resulting environmental performance targets) that may be automatically updated based on prior-year operational data. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The two tables below present examples of the proposed seasonal environmental performance targets for VOC and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  in the South Coast area. As with the emission limits presented earlier in this section, these example targets are provided for illustrative purposes only and do not represent the final enforceable emission performance targets. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

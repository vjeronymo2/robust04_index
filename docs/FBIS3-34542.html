			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by Mohammad Sarafraz: "What Are the Turkish </F> Government's Objectives?"]    [Text] On Friday Turkish jets infiltrated 100 km into Iraqi  territory and extensively bombed parts of that country.  Apparently 50 Turkish jets participated in the operation, which  resulted in civilian casualties in Iraqi Kurdistan.    Turkey's Kurdish Workers' Part [PKK] has denied that even  one  of its members was killed. Meanwhile, the Turkish military did  not spare Iranian civilians and killed and wounded 28 people in  the two villages in Sardasht. The two villages of Tuzhaleh and  Nukan in (Qasemrash) area were hit by missiles.    This situation cannot be assessed without taking into  consideration Turkey's plans for the future of Iraqi Kurdistan.    In Europe, and specifically in Britain and France, steps  have  been taken to dismember Iraqi Kurdistan and to form a Kurdish  state.    The United States conditionally approves of this.    America's condition is that this process not benefit Iraq  and  Iran and benefit Turkey.    The Turkish Government is pursuing a vague stance of double  standards. On the one hand, by accepting the continued presence  of U.S., British, and French forces on its territory, it paves  the way for the formation of a Kurdish government while on the  other it knows that because it has the largest Kurdish  population in the area it will be the one mostly harmed by the  formation of this government.    Recently, Turkey signed a border security agreement with the  Islamic Republic of Iran with the intention of crushing the PKK.    If the concern felt by the Ankara Government over PKK  activities inside Turkey is removed, it will give in to the  objectives of the Western governments in this region more easily.    Therefore, the insistence by the officials in Ankara for  signing a border agreement with Iran has nothing to do with  their goodwill, and once the threat of the PKK against Turkey is  removed, the Kurdish counterrevolutionaries' pressures on Iran  is expected to increase.    At any rate, the Turkish air raid on Iranian territory  should  not be considered an ordinary act. The Turkish Government wants  to first send a committee to the bombed region to study the  situation and then to make a statement. Ankara cannot simply  close the issue by merely expressing its apologies. The  casualties that the Iranian border residents have suffered is  high. If this is the outcome of the two countries' border  cooperation, then the entire principle of the issue should be  doubted.    There should be security either for both governments or none  in the Iranian and Turkish Kurdish-inhabited areas.    Some time ago, Talabani's forces in coordination with the  European governments started to crush the Muslim Kurds in Iraq.  This was an attempt to form a secular government in Kurdistan.  One can see the role played by Turkey's security forces in this  incident. The Turkish Government should be made to understand  that any type of action by the European governments in its  territory, which will lead to the dismemberment of Iraqi  Kurdistan and the formation of a Kurdish government, will be to  the detriment of the entire region and should be halted as soon  as possible.</p>

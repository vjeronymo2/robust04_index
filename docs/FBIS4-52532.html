			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by TONG-A ILBO Executive Director Nam Si-uk: </F> "The Peace Treaty Offensive and the Position To Cope With It"]    [Text] There is something that we should take into  consideration when discussing the peace treaty issue raised by  North Korea. It is the Geneva peace talks held in April 1954.    The Geneva talks were held 40 years ago and have almost been  forgotten. It is strange that even experts have no particular  interest in the talks. It is necessary, however, to review the  talks to correctly understand and properly cope with the peace  treaty issue between North Korea and the United States.    The Geneva peace talks were held as a step following the  conclusion of the Korean Armistice Agreement signed in July  1953. The Armistice Agreement stipulates that representatives of  countries concerned should hold political talks within three  months after the effectuation of the agreement to discuss the  withdrawal of all foreign troops from the Korean peninsula and a  peaceful method to resolve the Korean issue and to conclude a  proper treaty that will replace the Armistice Agreement. Since  they discussed not only the Korean peninsula issue but also the  peace issue on the Indo-Chinese peninsula at that time, the  meeting was called the Geneva Far East Peace Talks.    Present at discussions on the Korean issue in Geneva were  North Korea, the former Soviet Union, China, and the 16  member-states of the United Nations, including Britain and  France, that participated in the Korean war. In the beginning  of the talks, Britain took the lead in discussions by presenting  five principles for Korean reunification under the supervision  of the United Nations. Corresponding to this, the ROK put  forward 14 principles in a proposal that the UN troops be  withdrawn from the Korean peninsula after the ROK has  satisfactory results from free elections under UN supervision.  The Soviet Union, however, presented a five-point resolution  urging all foreign troops to be withdrawn first. North Korea  put forward a six-point resolution demanding the establishment  of an all-Korean committee after the withdrawal of all foreign  troops. Because of such differences in opinion, the discussion  on the Korean issue was ruptured about two months after it  began. Eventually, they failed to reach agreements on the method  of reunification and the method of concluding a peace treaty.    This Geneva meeting shows the following three facts: First,  the Geneva meeting has verified the stark fact that the ROK is a  party concerned with the Korean war armistice system. Despite  this fact, North Korea has used tactics to exclude the ROK from  the Military Armistice Commission [MAC] under the pretext that  the ROK is not a signatory of the Armistice Agreement. It has  not attended MAC meetings since the UN chief delegate of the MAC  was recently replaced by an ROK Army officer. Now, it is even  trying to paralyze the function of the MAC by withdrawing its  delegates from the MAC.    North Korea's insistence that a certain country is a  signatory of the Armistice Agreement and another is not is  nothing but North Korea's propaganda because those who signed  the Armistice Agreement were not countries, but were instead UN  troops, North Korean troops, and the commander of the Chinese  People's Volunteers. (There are many Koreans who believe North  Korea's false insistence is correct.)    Second, the peace treaty issue should be discussed by all  countries concerned with the war, as was so in Geneva. North  Korea, however, has insisted on concluding a peace treaty only  with the United States. It took no regard of the ROK. The  South-North agreement was concluded in December 1991, but North  Korea has not observed it. Article 5 of the South-North  agreement stipulates that South and North Korea should make  joint efforts to replace the present cease-fire with a "peace  state" and should abide by the Armistice Agreement until it is  replaced with a peace treaty.    Third, although we can help facilitate the holding of North  Korea-U.S. talks and further the establishment of North  Korea-U.S. diplomatic ties to induce the opening of North Korea,  it is wrong for us to agree that North Korea and the United  States hold talks over the nuclear issue and discuss the peace  treaty issue. North Korea's insistence on discussing the nuclear  issue only with the United States is originally absurd. It  seems that North Korea will certainly propose the conclusion of  a peace treaty when the third round of North Korea-U.S. talks  are held. The U.S. Departments of Defense and State have  different positions on this.    U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry said that it is  impossible to conclude a peace treaty, but Assistant Secretary  of State Robert Gallucci said everything can be discussed in the  third round of talks with North Korea. We cannot figure out  what on earth the U.S. position is. The ROK position on this is  that the peace treaty issue should be discussed with the ROK  first since it is a party concerned, however, the nuclear issue  should be resolved first at the present stage.    As shown by the Geneva talks, a peace treaty is, in nature,  a  treaty that parties concerned with a war sign to put an end to  the war and restore peace. It is different from an ordinary  agreement between countries on friendship and cooperation  because it is a treaty for post-war arrangements. Accordingly,  the precedent of the Geneva peace talks should be respected in  handling the peace treaty issue for post-Korean War arrangements.    By the way, these days a peace treaty is not always required  for normalizing diplomatic relations between countries concerned  with a war. For example, Japan and the former Soviet Union  restored their diplomatic relations simply by issuing a joint  declaration on it, but have not yet concluded a peace treaty.  The United States and China signed a peace treaty four years  after the establishment of diplomatic ties, and Japan and China  did the same. Accordingly, the conclusion of a peace treaty is  not necessary for establishing diplomatic relations between  North Korea and the United States. North Korea's hidden purpose  is to raise the issue of withdrawing U.S. forces in Korea.    The government must invariably push ahead with the policy  that the peace treaty issue should be resolved by South and  North Korea in accordance with the South-North agreement, not by  North Korea and the United States, and must try to convince the  United States to agree to the policy. At the same time, the  government should make efforts to let the people know the nature  of the peace treaty issue. Some naive young people stand  inwardly on the North Korean side, wondering what is wrong with  the North Korean proposal for replacing the Armistice Agreement  with a peace treaty with the United States. The government has  the responsibility to help create a righteous public opinion in  the country, doesn't it?</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The Sanaa regime early this  morning began an attack on the battle lines, but is being  resisted with heroism and bravery. At the same time it has been  shelling residential areas in the quarters of al-Shaykh Uthman,  al-Mansurah and Dar Sa'd since this morning. Innocent citizens  are being killed and wounded. The Sanaa regime is also shelling  vital installations such as the desalination plant, the power  station, the fire station, and the refinery.    The Sanaa regime is wrong in believing that its killing of  citizens and destruction of homes and vital installations will  weaken the morale of the sons of our people and force them to  prostrate themselves before occupation and humiliation. The  sons of our people prefer to die bravely in defense of their  homeland and the protection of their women's honor than to  prostrate and humble themselves before a regime which does not  believe in ideals and does not respect people. It is a regime  which is not interested in law or legitimacy whether religious,  Arab, or international.    In the name of the Democratic Republic of Yemen we announce  to the fraternal Arab countries and the international community  that the Sanaa regime will not uphold any pledge or commitment  it makes to them. It aims to occupy, destroy, loot, pillage and  dishonor.    Diplomatic advice is achieving nothing except to give more  time to the Sanaa regime to continue with its attempts at  malicious destruction of our people and Aden, in particular.    For this reason we wish to stress what we said in our  previous appeal, and the need to take deterrent measures to  compel the Sanaa regime to heed the resolutions of the  international community and respect human rights. As for our  people, they will not submit, and will resist the aggressors  with all the strength available to them. God is with us and  those who do wrong should know what kind of end they will suffer.</p>

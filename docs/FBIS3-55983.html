			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Captain First Rank Valeriy Gromak: "Young </F> Journalists Become Ministers"]    [Text] The Estonian president has appointed Juri Luik, the  country's former defense minister, as foreign minister. His  post has been taken by Indrek Kannik, hitherto an adviser to the  foreign minister. Evidently Juri Luik will leave his post as  head of delegation at the talks with Russia, since, according to  the Estonian side, his new post will not allow him to conduct  talks with "a mere ambassador of the Russian Federation."    Luik and Kannik are recent graduates from the Tartu  University Journalism Faculty and members of the Estonian  student community; they are 27 years old, and have not yet  settled down to married life.</p>

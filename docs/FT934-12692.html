			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / Inside the prisons of the intifada: Life in the jails of the occupied territories WELCOME to the detention centre, says the sign in Hebrew outside Gaza's Ansar II prison, presumably for the benefit of Israeli soldiers unfortunate enough to be stationed there. Underneath, the same message in Arabic has greeted the thousands of intifada offenders who have passed through the gates since the Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation broke out in late 1987. Ansar II, in common with the other jails in Israel and the occupied territories where Palestinian prisoners are held, is a dump - a coastal sprawl of tents, concrete offices, barbed-wire fencing and olive-green watch towers. It is a dump, though, that is nearing the end of its life. Under an agreement reached by Israeli and negotiators for the Palestine Liberation Organisation last Thursday, Israel yesterday released 700 Palestinian detainees - the old, the young, the sick and the women. In the weeks and months ahead, almost all the 10,000 or so Palestinians now in jail are to be freed. Only a few hundred inmates 'with Israeli blood on their hands' may be kept in custody. Some of those identified with Yassir Arafat's mainstream Fatah faction of the PLO, such as Salim Zriri, released earlier this week after 23 years in Israeli captivity, may become leading supporters of the Israeli-PLO autonomy programme. Others, though, members of Hamas and the rest of the Palestinian rejectionist groups, will be the peace accord's most dangerous opponents. Inside Ansar II, as at the other jails, the Fatah and Hamas inmates are kept strictly apart. The bearded, sullen men of Hamas have the worst conditions, sleeping in crowded tents, crammed into a narrow compound that allows little space for exercise. Most of the Fatah detainees, by contrast, sleep in squat concrete buildings - also inside fenced-off compounds, but with more room to walk around, room, too, for table-tennis tables supplied by the Red Cross. Ansar II is a holding jail with space for just a few hundred, a first stop for alleged offenders, from killers to graffiti artists. Brought in for questioning, they can then be held, tried, transferred or freed. Life in the compounds is dull but not especially harsh. The Red Cross ensures that the food is good. The Israelis are non-intrusive beyond calling the prisoners together twice a day for roll-call: inmates squat on their haunches in lines, and bob up when their names are called. But in a nearby interrogation centre, run by the Shin Bet security service, there are no niceties. The first stage of a Shin Bet interrogation routinely involves a prisoner being blindfolded, handcuffed behind his back and left to stand outside for hours. Those who don't co-operate can be kept for days, alone or in pairs, in tiny, filthy cells, defecating into plastic buckets. The Israeli human rights group, B'Tselem, has documented several cases of alleged torture by the Shin Bet at Ansar II. Friday is visiting day. Long lines of anxious Palestinian mothers wait to spend a few minutes face-to-face - across a wire grill - with their sons. For most prisoners this is the only chance to leave the compounds; only the shawish - the Palestinian trusty in each compound through whom all communication with the Israelis is conducted - can move move freely around the jail. The Israelis are not proud of Ansar II or the other prisons like it. When Israel television was preparing a news report on prisoner releases this week, it had to resort to archive footage of the Ketziot jail in the Negev Desert; the military authorities would not allow a camera crew inside any of the jails to shoot fresh film. The Israelis are also acutely aware that the prisons have served only to re-inforce opposition to the occupation. Far from being a deterrent, a jail term is essential to the credibility of any self-respecting Palestinian activist. It is richly ironic that, with the dawn of Palestinian self-rule, many of those PLO loyalists now serving their final week inside Israeli jails may well soon be joining the Palestinian police force - working alongside the Israeli military authorities to ensure a smooth transfer of power from Israeli to Palestinian hands in the occupied territories. The Israeli authorities do not normally allow reporters into prisons for Palestinians. David Horovitz saw Ansar II from the inside while serving there as an Israeli army reservist last year.</p>

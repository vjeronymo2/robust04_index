			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 22 KYODO -- The main opposition Liberal  Democratic Party (LDP) formally decided Wednesday [22 June] to  submit a no-confidence motion against the coalition government  of Prime Minister Hata, party officials said.    The LDP approved submission of the motion at the party's  decision-making Executive Council.    The LDP is scheduled to submit the motion immediately after  the Diet passage of the long-overdue government-proposed budget  for fiscal 1994. The current Diet session ends June 29.    The LDP's decision came amid a series of strategic talks  held  separately between the Social Democratic Party, which quit the  ruling alliance in April, and coalition parties seeking to lure  the SDP back into the fold.</p>

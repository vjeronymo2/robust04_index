			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Riding the rollercoaster: Martin Wolf asks whether the EC's Edinburgh summit can help revive the performance of Europe's ailing economy From Eurosclerosis to Europhoria and back again; this has been the history of the European Community since the beginning of the 1980s. It has been an exciting rollercoaster ride. But will the Edinburgh summit bring the next rise any closer? Good economic performance is not optional. It is the EC's lifeblood. Periods of rapid growth, such as the 1950s, 1960s, early 1970s and late 1980s, have also been times of advance. Growth encourages governments to take risks with integration, and integration in turn promotes growth. It is probably no accident that 1984 was when the British budget rebate was settled, when thoughts turned to the Single European Act (SEA) and the programme to complete the single market, and also when the EC economy returned to reasonable economic growth once more. The EC economy as a whole expanded at 2 1/2 per cent a year or more in every year between 1984 and 1990 (see chart). During those years, the SEA was conceived and ratified. The single-market programme was put in place. The exchange rate mechanism became both more stable, with realignments virtually ceasing after January 1987, and more universal. In a last burst of Euro-enthusiasm, a treaty on economic and monetary union was conceived, negotiated and agreed at Maastricht. None of these achievements was particularly easy. Economic success made them possible. The good EC performance in the seven fat years between 1984 and 1990 was partly a reflection of the worldwide recovery, which began in the US. The weakness of the dollar from 1985 was also expansionary, since it induced monetary loosening in countries whose monetary authorities tried to support the American currency. Improved EC performance also reflected changes specific to the EC. Successful reduction in inflation in the first half of the 1980s (see chart) made possible renewed growth. Meanwhile, the single-market programme was part of a wider European process of liberalisation and structural reform. As for the programme itself, the most important fruit may have already been picked. The rapid expansion of EC business investment that occurred during the second half of the 1980s was partly in anticipation of the completion of the single market. Yet European economic performance was not an unalloyed success. Aggregate economic growth was reasonably satisfactory for a rich region with low population growth. But many worried about the failure of the EC to take a leading place on the technological frontier in industries like computer manufacture and consumer electronics. Whether they are right to worry, only time can tell. One problem did become more obvious. Eurosclerosis - the market rigidities thought to be inhibiting EC growth - may have been exaggerated, but the sclerosis of the EC labour market was not (see chart). The EC-wide unemployment rate last peaked at just under 11 per cent in 1986, only a little above the US peak. But US unemployment fell to 5.3 per cent in 1989 and total US employment grew by 18 per cent between 1979 and 1991. By contrast, EC unemployment only fell to 8.4 per cent in 1990 before rising to 9.8 per cent in October, while total EC employment grew only 7 per cent between 1979 and 19991. With this important exception, the EC economy still looked healthy a couple of years ago. This is no longer the case. The EC economy is struggling, not least Germany's, despite what should have been the great opportunity provided by German unification and despite the absence in most of continental Europe of the overhang of private-sector debt that has depressed the Anglo-Saxon economies, as well as Scandinavia and Japan. What has gone wrong? First of all, the EC's problems must not be exaggerated. Economic slowdowns are inevitable. This said, some explanations are required, especially when the recessions of 1973-76 and 1979-83 had the specific proximate causes of the oil price shocks. Fatalistic appeal to very long term, Kondratieff, cycles is not persuasive. In the second place, there was a significant deterioration in the international environment. Under George Bush, the US had its poorest performance since President Hoover, with identical results for the hapless incumbent. The debt deflation that weakened the US economy has also undermined the performance of other economies. Combined, they account for two-thirds of OECD economic output. Yet even the external environment is not a sufficient explanation for worsening EC performance. The EC's gross domestic product of Dollars 6.2 trillion (million million) in 1991 was even greater than that of the US, while its ratio of external merchandise exports to GDP was only 8.4 per cent. The EC ought to be able to grow under its own steam. It certainly should be able to do so as well as the open developing countries of east Asia, which are doing just that. Third and most important have been internal economic developments. The UK is the debt-deflating cuckoo in the EC nest. Meanwhile, in Italy, public-sector excess has made up for private sector prudence. It is no accident that these two countries, which account for a third of EC GDP, are in severe economic difficulties and have seen their currencies forced out of the ERM. Yet what has happened to the UK and Italy has not been the EC's most important internal development. That honour must be accorded to German unification, an event that is remaking both the country at the heart of Europe and Europe itself. Unfortunately, German unification has been met by a number of serious mistakes that share a common feature: the attempt to subordinate economic forces to political dictation. The first set of errors was made in Germany itself: the commitment to one-for-one monetary conversion and the acceptance of premature wage convergence. These mistakes were compounded by others: failure to understand the implications of east-west wage convergence for all-German real wages; and the decision to borrow to cover most of the initial costs of the transfers to east Germany, which are some 7 per cent of west German GDP. These decisions led to open conflict between the government, on the one hand, and a battered Bundesbank, on the other. The second set of errors occurred in the EC as a whole. A real appreciation of the D-Mark was required to facilitate absorption of resources within the German economy. A D-Mark realignment or, better still, temporary flotation of the D-Mark would have been a superior method of bringing about the needed adjustment than the deflation throughout the EC, via high real interest rates, that has actually occurred. European policymakers decided to harden the ERM, despite German unification, while doing nothing to make the system able to bear the strain. The results of this mistake have been seen this autumn. The pound and the lira have been forced out; the peseta and the escudo have had to realign; and the Irish punt, the Danish krone and the French franc have come under pressure. If these are the problems, what are the solutions? The urgency of the cyclical problem must not be exaggerated. The Bundesbank is almost certain to lower short-term interest rates over the next 12 months. It may even do so quite sharply. The US economy is recovering as well. By 1995 the EC economy is likely to look far healthier than it does now. These prospects should themselves ease market pressure, particularly via further weakening of the D-Mark, which is needed to improve long-term German competitiveness and improve its rapidly deteriorating cyclical position. Little can be expected of the EC's growth package. The Commission argues that symbolic action is needed to boost confidence. Greater confidence is, indeed, required. But economies are not in poor shape because confidence is poor. Confidence is poor because economies are in poor shape. Furthermore, the case for more EC infrastructure spending, sound enough in itself, should not be linked to the EC's cyclical problems, since cyclically motivated infrastructure spending is almost always mistimed. Something more substantial, such as the stimulus of 1 per cent of EC GDP proposed by the Commission, will not happen, not least because Germany, which bears deep scars from when it agreed to be a 'locomotive' in the late 1970s, is opposed. The budgetary difficulties of Italy, the UK, Germany and Spain (which together account for more than two-thirds of EC GDP) also suggest that a substantial co-ordinated fiscal stimulus would be unwise. It might even be counterproductive, though such a stimulus could perhaps make sense for France. This does not mean that the EC is doomed to sit and twiddle its thumbs. The first priority for the EC is monetary easing. Under present arrangements, a member state can enjoy that only by leaving the ERM altogether or by waiting for the Bundesbank to move. Belabouring the Bundesbank is counterproductive. Changing ERM arrangements is not. The ERM without exchange controls has proved itself half-baked, especially subjected to the stresses of German unification and the inability of the German government to make its policies more communautaire. If there is to be economic and monetary union, those who make the grade should start as soon as possible. Waiting around for years - at least four, according to the Maastricht treaty, and probably more - will ensure more accidents. Alternatively - or at the same time, but for different countries  -the ERM should be made more flexible. UK short-term interest rates are now below German ones because the pound is expected to appreciate. With temporarily wider margins, perhaps for just the next year or so, other countries could enjoy the same luxury. The second and more intractable policy issue is the EC labour market. It will be impossible to sustain a stable ERM, let alone Emu, if the performance of labour markets continues to deteriorate. The problem did not go away in the fat years. It has returned to haunt the lean ones. It must be a principal focus of policymakers' attention. These are not the questions that will keep the EC policymakers up over the weekend. But the implication of their limited agenda are also clear. Their deliberations may determine where the EC goes politically. They will contribute little, directly, to its prosperity.</p>

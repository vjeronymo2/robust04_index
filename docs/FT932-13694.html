			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Leading Article: ERM remains on trial WHEN MR EDOUARD Balladur, the new French prime minister, meets Chancellor Helmut Kohl in Bonn today, he will at least leave no foreign exchange crisis behind him. The French authorities have managed to cut short-term interest rates, while maintaining the franc firmly within its exchange rate mechanism bands. They will now wait for the Bundesbank to give them the lower interest rates they need. But even if the immediate crisis were to prove over, questions about the future of the ERM would remain. The Bundesbank is virtually certain to loosen monetary policy further, if more slowly than France would wish and not as far as it needs. This helps explain why Mr Balladur does not seem anxious to promote divisive Franco-German monetary initiatives. What he has done, instead, is position his country for future monetary discussions by promoting the independence of the Banque de France. Such discussions must be rather likely. The immediate crisis in the ERM may be fading, though this cannot be assured so long as the current slowdown lasts. But even a period of stability would not end the story. Transition to economic and monetary union (Emu) on the lines laid down in the Maastricht treaty looks unlikely this century. Yet the ERM's credibility has been seriously damaged by events. The European Community is in monetary policy limbo. The central bank governors do not see things so apocalyptically. They regard the agonies of the ERM as the result of a number of specific forces: inadequate inflation convergence between 1987 and 1992; cyclical divergences in 1991 and 1992; inflationary pressure in Germany following unification; inadequate fiscal consolidation in many countries; and wide fluctuations in exchange rates against the US dollar and the yen. These should have caused greater exchange rate pressure than occurred, they argue. That they did not is because of the expectation of steady progress toward Emu, an expectation that was overturned by the Danish referendum. On this view, the ERM can become fully workable once more, provided governments allow timely exchange rate adjustment or pursue policies more conducive to economic convergence. The view is arguable, but not convincing. It does not allow for the instability of adjustable peg exchange rate regimes, in the absence of exchange controls. If pre-emptive realignments are expected, markets will force them to happen. But if such realignments are not expected, the pressure for short-term interest rate convergence is likely to thwart convergence of inflation. The ERM may survive for a while without further crises, largely because the Bundesbank must now act in ways that would also stabilise the European economy. But the ERM is far from flawless. It has flaws, nay 'fault lines'. Unhappily for France, there exists no simple cure.</p>

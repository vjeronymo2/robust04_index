			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Asian oilmen's troublesome pipedreams - New routes are the key to exploiting the region's big reserves Failure to find politically acceptable export routes is impeding the flow of oil and natural gas from central Asia to western markets. Three deals depend wholly or largely on pipeline routes out of the Caspian for their viability. First, the US oil company Chevron's project at Tengiz in Kazakhstan - in which over Dollars 600m has been invested and around Dollars 20bn is scheduled to be put in during the project's 40-year life - still awaits agreement on financing a new export pipeline. Only 60,000 barrels a day are allowed through the existing pipelines. Secondly, the Dollars 8bn deal between a group of 10 foreign oil companies led by BP and the Azerbaijan government to exploit reserves off Baku was ratified by the Azerbaijani parliament last week - but no route out for the oil is agreed. Thirdly, a deal should be closed by November 30 to allow development of the massive Karachaganak gas field in Kazakhstan by British Gas and Agip of France - but it lacks transportation. In each case,the companies have sought or agreed Russian participation to satisfy Moscow's demands that it benefits from the deals. But so far the result has been deadlock: 'Russia does not seem so interested in making money as in keeping all of these countries under its thumb,' says one frustrated oil company executive in Alma Ata. The contrasting view is that the blockages are temporary and that the sheer energy wealth of the area will sooner rather than later produce agreements. Mr Steve Remp, chairman of the British oil services company Ramco, a member of the Azerbaijani consortium, says that 'what you will see in due course is that the issue will turn from being a liability to being a very positive generator of income for the area'. The key player in these increasingly grand geopolitical manoeuvres is Russia. Mr Yuri Shafranik, the Russian energy minister, made clear last week that Russia must have a major stake in all energy projects. This policy which has meant that the Lukoil oil company and the Gasprom gas corporation have substantial stakes in the Azerbaijani and Karachaganak fields, and that Russian pressure has been able to block any pipeline deal. A host of different schemes are now being discussed by the states and companies involved - all of which would require multi-billion dollar financing. Upgrading the existing pipeline which carries Russian and some Chevron oil to Novorossisk, Russia's main oil exporting port on the Black Sea. One plan being considered by the Baku consortium is to reverse the pipeline which used to carry crude from the Russian province of Tyumen to the Baku refinery, so that it carried Azerbaijani oil out to join an existing pipeline to Novorossisk. This line could also carry oil from Kazakhstan. The largest problem comes after Novorossisk. Turkey, pressing for a line through its territory, has said the Bosphorous straits through which ships from Novorossisk must pass, cannot take any more tankers: the Russians have responded by proposing that the oil is transhipped to Burgas, on the coast of Bulgaria, then piped to the Greek port of Alexandroupolis. A line through Iran or Georgia to meet an existing line which had carried Iraqi crude to the Turkish Mediterranean port of Ceyhan. The problem with this line is that it goes through Kurdish areas but avoids the Bosphorous. Further, Azerbaijan announced last week that the Iranian Oil Company had joined the consortium - prompting speculation that this route, or another through Iranian territory, could now be in prospect. A line through Georgia to the port of Batumi on the Black Sea - to be again transhipped to Burgas, piped to Alexandroupolis and out through the Mediterranean. Georgia would benefit from this - but the government is in no state to guarantee the security of the line. The most radical proposal, under study by Mitsubishi, is to construct a pipeline from Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan 1500km through western China where it could link up with an existing pipeline from China's Tarim Basin to the coast. Turkmenistan, the region's main gas producer, needs a new exit most since Russia controls its gas lines beyond its borders and has put a block on much of the expected Dollars 1bn annual proceeds from gas sales. Three weeks ago a Dollars 7bn gas pipeline project to take the gas to the Mediterranean was inaugurated - though no one believes the work will begin soon and many believe the project is more symbolic than real. The only sure thing is that the manoeuvres will continue.</p>

			<p><P> January 22, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> CATS' EARWAX CRAVING QUERIED  </P> <P> A scientist wants to know why his cats seem to want the whole ball of wax.  Earwax, that is. In a letter published in the British scientific journal  Nature, Thomas Arny, a physicist at the University of Massachusetts, seeks the  help of the research community in determining why his two Siamese cats "greatly  enjoyed the taste of human earwax."  </P> <P> The cats' craving for earwax is so great, Arny said, that one "leaps on the bed  in the morning hoping to be offered some."  </P> <P> When the Massachusetts scientist mentioned his pets' odd behavior to three  other people, he said they told him their cats also had a fondness for wax.  "I'd always thought that earwax tasted very bitter (as a deterrent to insects  getting into your ears), so I find the cats' reaction hard to understand," Arny  wrote.  </P> <P> "Does any of your readers have any explanation? I wonder if it might be a means  to induce cats to groom their kittens," he asked.  </P></p>

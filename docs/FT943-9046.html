			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / International Company News: Charter delays intentions on Esab until bid count completed Charter, the UK industrial group, said it would announce on Monday its next move in its bid for the Swedish welding group Esab after it failed to achieve a complete takeover by yesterday's deadline. The British company said it was awaiting the final outcome of its offer before making any public statement about its intentions. Although Charter's Swedish advisers were still counting the returns from small shareholders last night, it was already certain it had failed to achieve the 90 per cent acceptances set as a condition of the bid. Charter's options include increasing the Pounds 260m (Dollars 403m) bid, as many Swedish shareholders anticipate, holding with the majority stake it is already assured of or dropping the bid altogether. A full takeover at the original offered price of SKr345 per share was stymied earlier this week when five Swedish institutions with 20 per cent of Esab's voting capital rejected the bid. This was despite the fact it was recommended by Esab's board and accepted by Incentive, the Wallenberg family industrial group and Esab's controlling shareholder. Before yesterday Charter was assured only of 53 per cent acceptances, made up of 48 per cent held by Incentive and 5 per cent it had earlier purchased in the market. The institutional shareholders rejected the bid as underpriced following a sharp rise in Esab's share price since the offer was made in June and a big rise in Esab's profit forecast for this year.</p>

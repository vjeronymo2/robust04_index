			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From MAINICHI SHIMBUN 26 March Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] Speaking on the issue of the DPRK's suspected  development of nuclear weapons on 25 March, a top leader of the  Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] said: "When Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa visited China, the Chinese Government  indicated that it was desirable to settle the issue gradually  like the effects of taking Chinese herbal medicine. Our party's  position is almost the same as China's." In this way, the top  official indicated the party understands China's position which  places emphasis on settling the issue through continuous  dialogue. He then indicated a cautious attitude toward UN moves  toward sanctions, saying: "Even if the United Nations imposes  sanctions, they are not always effective in settling issues.  Nations cannot help having mixed feeling when urged to listen to  what other nations say."    The top official reiterated the party will come up with its  own measures to deal with the issue by the end of this month, in  preparation for an SDPJ delegation's visit to China on 1 April.  However, regarding the possibility of making direct contacts  with the Worker's Party of Korea, the top official noted:  "Since it is a matter of convenience, we cannot visit Pyongyang  without making advance arrangements." Furthermore, the party's  current standpoint as a member of the ruling parties is  different from its former position as an opposition party.</p>

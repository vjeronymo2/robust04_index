			<p><P> March 23, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> LORRY: BROODY BRITS THAT ARE HARD TO DISMISS  </P> <P> Red Lorry Yellow Lorry has no truck with levity.  </P> <P> Still, the British band's show on Wednesday at the Coach House in San Juan  Capistrano (they also play Helter Skelter in Hollywood tonight) was a cut above  much of what has come out of the sorrow-and-gloom school of post-punk Anglo  rock.  </P> <P> When broody Brit bands like the Mission U.K. come over and start acting like so  many baleful Young Werthers, the first reaction is to wish they'd quit the  posing, buy some Chuck Berry records and lighten up.  </P> <P> It was harder to dismiss the haggard-looking lead Lorry, Chris Reed. At his  best, Reed's deep, harsh voice fairly seethed with existential anger, set  against the quartet's rumbling march rhythms and a wash of guitar distortion  and feedback that occasionally recalled the Velvet Underground and the Jesus  and Mary Chain.  </P> <P> The Lorrys' 55-minute set did include a few numbers intended to introduce a  degree of optimism. "The Rise" had an assured rhythmic surge and lyrics in  praise of individualism and independence, and the slow and stately "Shine a  Light" offered a prayerful reach in its refrain. But Reed's voice always  remained low and clenched, precluding any convincing sense of uplift. Velocity,  rather than emotional tone, was the main source of variation in a monolithic,  but intense set. MIKE BOEHM  </P></p>

			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / International Company News: Westpac chairman acts to calm angry investors WESTPAC Banking Corporation had achieved 'encouraging' operating results for the 1991-92 first quarter, chairman, Sir Eric Neal, told a long and, at times, fiery annual meeting in Sydney yesterday. Facing a barrage of questions from shareholders dissatisfied with the bank's performance, Sir Eric said an uncertain economic outlook precluded more specific profit predictions. However, he expected the group's troubled finance arm, Australian Guarantee Corporation, to perform this year in line with the year ended September, 1991, when it made a loss of about ADollars 220m (USDollars 164m). 'Westpac has already taken the hard decisions affecting its operations,' Sir Eric said. 'This will allow the bank to focus on better business opportunities and to build upon its inherent market strengths.' 'Despite the continuing poor economic conditions, Westpac's operating results for the first quarter of 1991-92 are encouraging and, if sustained, offer tangible proof that the worst is behind us.' Sir Eric received some much-needed public support from Australia's biggest investor, the AMP Society, whose managing director, Mr Ian Salmon, told the meeting the society would immediately purchase 74m Westpac shares. Mr Salmon said the purchase would cost about ADollars 300m. It followed Thursday night's approval from Federal Treasurer (chancellor), Mr John Dawkins, of a long-standing request for the AMP to lift its Westpac stake from 10 to 15 per cent.</p>

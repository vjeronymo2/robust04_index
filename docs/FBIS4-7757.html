			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus: "A Few Words About </F> the Convertibility of the Czech Koruna"]    [Text] The convertibility of the Czech koruna has become  one of the most topical political issues in the past few weeks.  This topic has appeared rather unexpectedly, and, according to  our habits acquired in the post-November era, it has become a  political topic.    Its real content has evaporated, and a completely wrong and  misleading political viewpoint has been created instead:  Whoever is in favor of full convertibility is a liberal--that  is, a proreformist politician--and whoever is asking what is the  proper moment and manner of the introduction of full  convertibility and who warns against simplification is a  politician who has abandoned his liberal faith and has become  someone who is curbing the progress.    I would like to show that the convertibility problem is not  so simple. I am not going to present delicate textbook  definitions regarding the convertibility of currency. Neither  am I going to deal with the problem that is irrelevant to our  discussion today--that is, should the yearly limit on foreign  currency purchases by Czech citizens be increased or lifted  altogether? This is a completely different matter.    I believe that no one who has been engaged in this  discussion  is questioning the fact that it is economically advantageous to  have:    --an independent and autonomous monetary policy that  respects  economic objectives;    --a fixed currency exchange rate, which is a starting point  for making our economy strong and that is also a comprehensible  signal to all domestic and foreign economic entities as regards  our economic policy in the future;    --a liberal flow of international capital (that is, the  koruna's full convertibility), which would complete our  integration into the world economy, and which is a  transformation step to follow after the koruna's "internal  convertibility" was introduced and foreign trade flows  liberalized on 1 January 1991.    It is not a problem to achieve one of the three goals--or  two  at a time-- but the problem is to achieve all three  simultaneously. M. Goldstein and J.A. Frenkel said in their  influential article in 1988: "The best thing to do is to  achieve two of the three objectives. When there is a debate  about monetary reform, the issue always is which of the two  objectives should be opted for." I would be very happy if we  discussed this problem rationally in our country right now.    From my viewpoint, I would like to say the following on this  subject:    There are countries whose specific situation makes them  indifferent toward the loss of the autonomy of their monetary  policy. They are countries that are not undergoing any specific  moment in their economic development. They are sorting out only  "current and normal" problems, and, because of that, they can  take the same course of action as their neighbors or their main  economic partners. It is a paradox that not only countries of  this type are willing to accept the loss of independence of  their monetary policy, but also some politically unstable  countries that do not have the courage to push for a tough and  much-needed economic policy are willing to accept this loss.  They believe that it is all right if the rest of the world, or  an important neighboring country, gives discipline and toughness  to their policy. (Certain countries participating in the  European Monetary System could serve as an example.) I am fully  convinced that the Czech Republic does not need to give up the  autonomy of its monetary policy.    The unique economic transformation in our country is based  on  the koruna's fixed conversion rate and pinning all the  price-affecting factors to a fixed exchange rate (while the  prices are still oscillating toward final values). The  consequence of our economic transformation is a fundamental  restructuring of our entire economy and a significant movement  of prices toward more balanced levels (for 40 years, prices have  been kept at irrationally established and completely erroneous  levels). To give up the fixed exchange rate would be unwise and  unnecessary at the moment. The disadvantages would outweigh the  advantages.    I would like to add one more thing. In Western countries,  domestic prices are very rigid (that is, inflexible). There are  various reasons for that (the oligopoly structure, excessive  state interventionism, and faulty social policy). The  flexibility of the currency exchange rate is a mechanism  reducing the inflexibility of the domestic price structures. In  our country, we do not have to do anything like that because our  domestic prices are still in the adjustment phase and are still  flexible enough. On the contrary, because their movement is  dependent on many conditions, they need a fixed point, such as  the exchange rate.    Despite the fact that our objective is to continue  liberalizing external economic relations, proceed with the  deregulation of the financial flows, and attain a higher degree  of external convertibility (according to the definitions of the  International Monetary Fund Charter, we will be able to achieve  the lower degree of "full" convertibility--that is, full  convertibility of the current account of the balance of  payment), it seems advantageous for the time being to opt for  the first two of the three hardly compatible objectives and make  them a short-term (or medium-term) priority.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Sunday Supplemental NTV" newscast] </F>   [Text] A delegation headed by Foreign Minister Roberto  Robaina has departed for the Nonaligned Movement [NAM]  ministerial summit in Cairo. Robaina explained the goals of the  summit, Cuba's position, and his visit to Qatar before departing:    [Begin Robaina recording] The goals are not far from the  aspirations Cuba has always defended regarding the NAM. Since  Cuba became a member, it has always called for strengthening the  Movement and its authority in representing the poor of the Earth  and those who do not have enough resources to allow their  peoples to live the way they deserve and to attain a voice and  authority that can be heard in the international arena.    These main goals that unite us are to strengthen the NAM and  to turn the NAM into a strong force at the United Nations and  other international forums and discussions. I believe in  turning the NAM into a truly integrated force, not only in terms  of North-South cooperation but also in terms of South-North  cooperation. Why not South-South cooperation? All these things  are part of the very broad agenda which we will discuss in Cairo.    I will visit Qatar at the invitation of that country's  foreign minister, who, as you know, visited Cuba a few months  ago. The main goal of this trip is to open our diplomatic  mission in Qatar.

			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Parliament lifts Tapie immunity Mr Bernard Tapie, the businessman-turned-politician, is expected to face prosecution on financial irregularity charges after the French national assembly lifted his parliamentary immunity. The 432-72 vote came in response to a judge's request to investigate alleged misuse of corporate funds from Testut, a small near-bankrupt manufacturer of weighing scales controlled by Bernard Tapie Finance. The company has been used to extend loans to Olympique-Marseille, the football club which Mr Tapie also controls, to buy football stars. In a separate investigation, another judge has applied to parliament to lift Mr Tapie's immunity from facing charges of bribing another soccer team to lose to O-M last May. Appealing to fellow deputies, Mr Tapie said yesterday: 'This assembly is asked to cast the first stone at me. And this will allow others to cast bigger, heavier stones perhaps at me, but perhaps they will also hit some of you.' Several, mostly Socialist deputies, have been implicated in alleged illegal funding of political parties by businessmen seeking public contracts.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Today Russia and Ukraine resolved the conflict which  has arisen because of Ukraine's gas debts and the delivery of  Russian gas to Ukraine. Our team has only just returned from  filming.    [Correspondent Zrelin] Throughout the whole of today  difficult talks were held in Moscow in the Gazprom building.  Even journalists invited to a news conference in the afternoon  had to wait 90 more minutes. While cameras were being set up in  the hall, the two sides were still defining their positions in  the final document.    So, Russia and Ukraine have agreed on the joint utilization  of the gas piplelines passing through Ukrainian territory and  also the storage tanks for the natural fuel, with the subsequent  sale of shares in them. It has been decided to introduce order  into the debts issue within a month, that is by 10 April, and  also to agree on the percentage of ownership of the gas  pipelines and the storage tanks.    [Ukraine Vice Premier V.I. Landik] This year we will pay for  gas only in money -- either rubles or hard currency -- but as  for the 1993 debts here it will be 50-50; that is we will supply  equipment and materials to Gazprom to cover 50 percent, and 50  percent will be paid in money, either rubles or hard currency.    [Zrelin] Moscow and Kiev have also decided to toughen up the  procedure for supplying fuel to consumers. This means that  enterprises in Ukraine will receive gas only if they pay in  advance. If there is no prepayment then there will be no gas.    [R.I. Vryakhirev, chairman of the board of Gazprom] If we do  not introduce order together, I mean by 10 April, then gas  supplies to Ukrainian consumers will be completely halted.    [Zrelin] It was also decided to in no way reduce export  supplies since European consumers have already demanded large  forfeits from Russia for non-fulfillment of contracts. Ukraine  has also promised to no longer take gas from export pipes.    Aleksandr Zrelin, Nikolay Grigorin, NTV, Moscow.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article in five installments by reporters Shuzo Mochida, </F> Midori Matsushima, Ko Hirai, Seiichi Nakamura, Yomei Tsuji:  "Undercurrent of Political Realignment"]  <H5>  [28 Feb 94 p 1] </H5>   [Text] On the late afternoon of 2 February Mr. Gaishi  Hiraiwa (adviser at Tokyo Electric Power), chairman of Keidanren  [Japan Federation of Economic Organizations], and Mr. Shoichiro  Toyoda (chairman at Toyota Motor), who has been selected as the  next chairman of Keidanren, grabbed Mr. Ichiro Ozawa, secretary  general of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] on the corridor of  the National Diet. They went into a small room.    "I want you to repeal the special corporate tax that you  introduced during the Gulf war when you were secretary general  of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]" (Mr. Hiraiwa). "I want  you to reduce the extra consumption tax on automobiles from 4.5  percent to 3 percent as promised" (Mr. Toyoda).    "I don't know, [if I can...]" replied Mr. Ozawa curtly to  the  current and the next leader of the economic circle. The meeting  lasted only three minutes.    Repeal of both the special corporate tax and the extra tax  on  automobiles was incorporated in the "public welfare tax" plan,  which was announced by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa in the  early morning of the following day, 3 February [1994].  Therefore, the government policy on these issues had already  been set quite a while ago.  <H5>  Condemn the LDP on Its Attitude Toward Political Reform </H5>   Six months or so have passed since the birth of the  coalition  government. There has been a big change in direction of the  economic circle's influence peddling -- away from the LDP toward  the governing coalition parties. Such was the case also in  behind-the-scene activities to pass the Political Reform Law.    On the morning of 26 January, five days after the rejection  of a political reform bill by the House of Councilors, Mr. Eiji  Suzuki (adviser at Mitsubishi Chemical Industries), former  chairman of Nikkeiren [Japan Federation of Employers'  Associations], contacted the leaders of four associations in the  economic circle and said, "We must speak up to promote political  reform." He also telephoned the prime minister.    [Mr. Suzuki] You should have a top-level meeting with Mr.  Yohei Kono, president of the LDP, and reach some kind of an  agreement.    [Prime Minister] Would you in the economic circle also try  to  stir up public opinion?    In the afternoon of the same day Mr. Ken Nagano (chairman at  Mitsubishi Materials) of the Nikkeiren sent a fax to the LDP's  headquarters, expressing his contempt for the party: "It seems  odd that people who oppose the reform bill are the majority."    On the evening of the same day Mr. Hiraiwa telephoned the  prime minister and told him: "Unless the political reform bill  is passed, we won't be able to advance our economic measures or  Japan-U.S. talks. We must avoid a political vacuum." Also, Mr.  Kosaku Inaba (president of Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries)  of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry said to the prime  minister over the telephone, "We want you to yield when  necessary."    Clearly the objective of the economic circle was to  compromise with the LDP and to avoid dissolution [of the Diet]  and general election. The prime minister asked Mr. Inaba,  "Please convey your message to the LDP, also."  <H5>  Hiraiwa Refused To Be Interviewed </H5>   The LDP interpreted the offensive from the economic circle  as  "pressure" (per a person close to Mr. Kono). Especially offended  were the people in the LDP's "anti-corruption" group. Between 25  and 26 January Mr. Taro Nakayama, former minister of the  Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MOFA] and a leading advocate of the  group, tried to communicate with Mr. Hiraiwa and others to  express their thought: "Even if political reform is postponed,  we will not attack the Hosokawa administration. We will go  forward with economic measures and the budget."    However, Mr. Hiraiwa and others didn't even offer to be  interviewed. Mr. Nakayama was angered by this and said, "The  economic circle refuses to listen." The LDP's promoters of  reform, however, also contributed to the behind-the-scene  maneuver of the economic circle.    The reason Mr. Suzuki telephoned the prime minister was that  he was prompted to do so by a telephone call in that morning  from former Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, who said, "We must set  up a top-level meeting." Former Deputy Prime Minister Masaharu  Gotoda asked Mr. Hiraiwa, "Please tell Mr. Hosokawa that if the  bill doesn't get passed, he will have to assume political  responsibility as prime minister."  <H5>  "They Are the Permanent Governing Party" </H5>   The relationship between the LDP's executive branch and the  economic circle had cooled even before then. On 30 November 1993  the leaders of four associations visited the LDP headquarters  with a document calling for quick implementation of political  reform. Mr. Kono snubbed this and said, "I don't understand why  you don't ask for economic measures by suspending your call for  political reform? We are much more knowledgeable on the issue of  political reform than you are."    Secretary General Yoshiro Mori was more adamant and said,  "If  you were told to do this by the Prime Minister's Office, it's  disgraceful." To Mr. Nagano and others who began to rebut, he  proclaimed, pounding on his desk, "The Nikkeiren should focus  its attention only on wages and labor issues." A person who was  at the meeting remembers that Mr. Hirawa's hands were trembling.  The meeting generated a ripple effect: "I don't want to see the  LDP executives any more" (per a vice chairman of Keidanren).    There was no contact between the leaders of the economic  circle and Mr. Kono even during the last stage of political  reform.    "People in the economic circle do what they are told to do  by  the Prime Minister's Office. After all, they are the permanent  governing party," says a person who used to hold one of the  LDP's three top executive positions. The close relationship of  the past no longer exists between the LDP and the economic  circle.    We will follow the "current relationship between the  political and economic circles" that began to oscillate after  the birth of the Hosokawa coalition government.  <H5>  [1 Mar 94 p 1] </H5>   [Text] Last summer the LDP borrowed 10 billion yen from  nine city banks for its election campaigns. Repayment schedules  have not been worked out yet, as an executive of a big steel  company says, "Probably, they won't be able to repay the loan.  They will probably have to arrange for repayment in installments  over 10 years or so."    An executive of a big city bank says, "If collection on the  loan becomes doubtful, Sumitomo Bank, which is going to be the  next presiding bank (of the Federation of Bankers Association of  Japan), will have to negotiate for mortgage."  <H5>  Keidanren Issues a Document to City Banks </H5>   Four individuals made a decision to request the city banks  to  lend 10 billion yen to the LDP, which played havoc with party  breakups, and to have Keidanren support its repayments. They  were Chairman Gaishi Hiraiwa (adviser at Tokyo Electric Power)  and four vice chairmen, who used to work for the automobile,  steel, electric, and banking industries, respectively.    But, the city banks strongly demanded a "guarantee" of  repayment from Keidanren.    This was due partly to the fact that the LDP had not repaid  4.5 billion yen of the total 15 billion yen it borrowed for its  campaigns for the 1990 general election. Also, there were rumors  that the LDP might slip from power after the election and be at  risk of further breakups.    "If the party breaks up again, we will be wondering which  splintered party will be the LDP (to repay the loan)" (per a  person in charge of the loan at a city bank).    According to several people involved in lending at these  city  banks, it was finally agreed that Keidanren would deliver to  each bank a "letter of de facto guaranty of repayment of the  loan" signed by Managing Director Natsuaki Fusano, who had been  in charge of [political] contributions. It was the first time  that Keidanren had been asked for such a guarantee ever since it  started to play the role of middleman for campaign contributions  to the LDP.    This is why the Keidanren declared that it would "continue  to  play the role of a middleman for repayment of this 10 billion  yen loan" at the same time when it decided last September to  discontinue its arrangement for annual contributions of about 12  billion yen to the LDP.    Keidanren's discontinuance of its role as a middleman,  however, had more than a little impact.    Keidanren used to convene executives of its member companies  in charge of funds in January each year. Following greetings  from the LDP secretary general and others, the chairman of the  Keidanren used to request cooperation from each of its member  companies.  <H5>  Continuing, Stopping, or Reducing Contributions </H5>   Keidanren gave its "official go-ahead" for subsequent  "collection of money" from its member companies by the LDP's  Treasury Bureau and persons on duty from the Kokumin Seiji  Kyokai [National Political Association]. Because of the  discontinuance of such arrangement, this kind of meeting will no  longer be held.    "With this recession, and as the LDP has become an  opposition  party, we can't give them money as we used to" (per Hajime  Murata, chairman of Japan Petrochemical Industry Association).    "There is no longer such a justification like defending the  free market economy. It will be awful if somebody brings about a  class action lawsuit of stockholders [against us], the filing  fee of which is now only 8,200 yen" (per Ryuzaburo Kaku,  chairman of Canon).    There were some industries that made contributions according  the LDP's request late last year. But all steel companies  curtailed contributions; the banking industry including city  banks and Japan Petroleum Industry Association cut their  contributions by 20 percent; and the Japan Camera Industry  Association discontinued contribution all together.    It became known in October that the electric power and gas  industries, which were supposed to have discontinued political  contributions as public utilities corporations, continued to  make de facto contributions to the LDP as advertisement expenses.    The electric power industry is called one of "five regent  families" along with the banking, automobile, electric  appliances, steel industries. It had been playing a leading role  in making contributions billed as "advertisements." Along with  the gas industry, however, it was pressured to "discontinue  advertisements," and the estimated advertisement cost of 1.1  billion yen for the LDP was cut in half last year.  <H5>  The Pipeline Is on the Brink of Collapse </H5>   Repayment of the 10 billion yen lent to the LDP means that  each industry must increase its political contribution  accordingly. Last fall's talks at Keidanren over the method of  repayment didn't produce any results because of the diversity of  proposals, ranging from "five-year installments" rather than  "three-year installments" to a suggestion saying, "Instead of  increasing the amount of contribution, we must handle this  within the normal amount of contributions." Since that time,  there has not been any discussion on this issue.    Now, Mr. Hiroshi Saito (chairman at Nippon Steel), vice  chairman of Keidanren, who objected to Mr. Hiraiwa's decision  to back the 10 billion yen loan, says coolly, "Before asking  others to pay, the electric power industry should pay for it  first."    On the evening of 10 December [1993] Mr. Hiraiwa and other  Keidanren officials were planning to have a meeting at a  restaurant in Tokyo with the LDP executives, including President  Yohei Kono. However, the LDP cancelled the meeting on the very  morning, saying, "The atmosphere [of the meeting] is likely to  become uncomfortable" (per Mr. Kono).    The largest pipeline for funds -- the "Keidanren route" --  is  on the brink of collapse.  <H5>  [2 Mar 94 p 1] </H5>   [Text] A caption next to a child holding a teddy bear says,  "Give me dreams." A girl running with a balloon in her hand is  accompanied by a caption saying, "Give me a season." These are  part of a full-page advertisement placed by Japan Federation of  Construction Contractors, Inc. in the LDP bulletin JIYU SHIMPO.  Report on a thermal power plant in Hokkaido was paid by the  Federation of Electric Power Companies [FEPCO]. The Federation  of Bankers Associations of Japan paid for an interview between  its chairman and the chairman of the LDP Policy Affairs Research  Council.    Leading industries, such as automobiles, electricity, and  banking have made a substantial increase in their advertisement  expenses for the LDP since 1990 so as to help the party repay  its 15 billion yen loan from the banks for the general election  of 1990.    The Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association, for example,  placed full-page ads, such as an advertisement calling for the  use of seat belts, in 32 of the total 48 issues published in  1991.  <H5>  Warning for Increased Unit Cost </H5>   "After all, how many ways are there to gather funds? We make  contributions to the party, its factions, and individual Diet  members. Are we going to pay for advertisements, also?"    "Jiyu Kikaku-sha," an advertising agency for the LDP, began  to handle advertisements in earnest for the bulletin in the late  1970's. The above prediction conveyed by a businessman to a  salesman from the agency became the reality in two to three  years.    In 1980 the agency received a request for advertisements  valued at more than 300 million yen from FEPCO, which had  supposedly discontinued political contributions.    A former executive at Jiyu Kikaku-sha confides: "It was  unusual, because up until then an ad at the bottom of a page on  JIYU SHIMPO had sold for 300,000 yen to 500,000 yen. The amount  of the fee had been determined first, so we were told by the LDP  to make things appear reasonable for that amount of money."    From the autumn of that year on, a report on nuclear power  generation appeared in the bulletin almost every week. A person  who was in charge of such advertisements at the LDP remembers  the warning by the tax office: "If you increase the unit cost of  an advertisement further, we will have to consider it as a  political contribution."    Jiyu Shimpo-sha's annual sales revenue stood at around 1.7  billion yen to 1.8 billion yen until 1989. Then, it jumped to  about 48 billion yen in 1990 and 69 billion yen in 1991. "It has  become inexplicable" even by the sponsors themselves (per a  businessman in charge of general affairs).    Adviser Jinpachiro Hanamura, who established the Keidanren  route, points out that repayment of the loans for campaign  financing prior to 1990 were made from funds obtained through  the National Political Association. He adds, "If the LDP doesn't  pinch and scrape, there is no other way to repay the loans than  through advertising expenses."  <H5>  To Dietmen Through the Party </H5>   Among contributions made through the National Political  Association, it was reported recently that Mr. Hideo Watanabe,  former minister at the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications  [MPT], had received "contributions with strings attached" in the  amount of 40 million yen from a large general contractor over  four years from 1988. A former chief of the LDP Treasury Bureau  says, "Such contributions became widespread for zoku-Dietmen  linked to particular industries. During my days, the party  charged a 20-percent commission."    Contributions through advertisements have also some  "strings"  attached to them. In 1984 a large mail-order company paid about  10 million yen to Jiyu Kikaku-sha for an ad in the LDP's monthly  journal, RIBURU. Most of this advertisement fee was distributed  to local Dietmen as organizational activity expenses and so on  through the LDP's Treasury Bureau. This was done according to a  prior agreement reached between the company and the Dietmen with  an LDP official as a go-between.    The "Keidanren route," which had been regarded as a pipeline  for "clean money" that has no linkage of vested interests  between politicians and particular corporations, also generated  various forms of "exterior" and "interior" worlds.    How much money in total is flowing from where to where? Many  people involved in this within the LDP and the economic circle  say that only Mr. Natsuaki Fusano, managing director of  Keidanren, and Mr. Jin Motojuku, chief of the LDP Treasury  Bureau, know the entire spectrum.    Mr. Motojuku has been specialized in the accounting field  throughout his work life and is also an executive of Jiyu  Kikaku-sha. He is quite "influential," as one staff member of  the LDP says, "Neither the general secretary nor the chief of  the Treasury Bureau knows the total picture, and they both just  rubber-stamp according to what the chief of the Accounting  Department says."    On the other hand, Mr. Fusano, a successor to Mr. Hanamura,  handles the entire aspect of contributions at Keidanren. Right  after Chairman Gaishi Hiraiwa decided to discontinue the role of  a middleman for contributions in August 1993, Mr. Fusano  gathered people in charge of political funds from leading  industries and told them that "I'm different from the chairman,"  suggesting that he would continue to play the role of middleman,  albeit unofficially.  <H5>  Unsatisfied Over the Prospect of No Rewards </H5>   Upon discontinuance of the Keidanren's role as a middleman,  criticism from the business sector erupted over contributions  through the Keidanren route: "They are like rent fees for a  gambling house. No rewards" (per an executive from the  securities industry). This is because a practical calculation  that rewards to corporations are uncertain and also because of  mounting dissatisfaction over putting money into a "black box"  (per an official at Keidanren).  <H5>  [3 Mar 94 p 1] </H5>   [Text] "I visited the vice chairman of Keidanren, but I  couldn't accomplish anything."    On 15 February [1994] Mr. Asahiko Mihara, chief of the  Treasury Bureau of Sakigake [Harbinger], visited Keidanren to  see Secretary General Masaya Miyoshi and Managing Director  Natsuaki Fusano. Ever since Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi  Takemura, chief representative of party, paid a visit to  Chairman Gaishi Hiraiwa last year, the party officials have  continued to request contributions from major industries. But  these visits have not generated any results yet.    Mr. Miyoshi and others advised Mr. Mihara: "You must be  patient and should make frequent visits to the presiding company  of each industry association."  <H5>  Looking at the Maximum Limit on Contribution </H5>   About 10 days before Mr. Mihara's visit, Mr. Muneaki  Samejima, chairman of the Finance Committee of the Japan New  Party, had a meeting with Mr. Shoji Okuda (president of Daiichi  Kangyo Bank), chairman of the Federation of Bankers Associations  of Japan. "If city banks make a decision, other industries will  follow. I sincerely beg your cooperation." Mr. Samejima believes  that February is the best time to request companies whose  acconting year ends in March to appropriate money for  contributions to his party for the 1994 fiscal year.    It was February last year when Mr. Morihiro Hosokawa, chief  representative of Japan New Party [JNP] before becoming prime  minister, visited Keidanren to see Mr. Fusano and bowed to him,  saying, "I beg your support." After launching his party, he  sought advice from his close friends in the economic circle on  how to raise funds. "He seems to have been thinking of some ways  to gather money in small amounts and on a general basis from the  citizens. But his ideas were all impractical" (per a young  financier). Eventually Mr. Hosokawa gave up on his idea of  gathering money "in small amounts and on a general basis," and  visited Keidanren.    One reason new parties are hurrying to gather contributions  is that on 1 March [1994] the House of Representatives passed a  bill on contributions to political parties, which would set the  "upper limit at two-thirds of the prior year's revenues" for  contributions for the next year. The amount of contributions to  Sakigake is estimated to be about 600 million yen. But, if it  doesn't approach 1 billion within this year, it will be cut  down. JNP has also set its target of contributions at 3 billion  yen.    On 25 June, two days after launching Shinseito, Mr. Tsutomu  Hata, head of the party, requested support from Mr. Hiraiwa and  other leading businessmen: "Several of us have borrowed money,  but there is a limit. I beg your consideration and support for  our new candidates."  <H5>  Steadily "Organizing Their System" </H5>   However, Shinseito, which "tided over the general election  with funds provided by its executives, largely by Mr. Ozawa  (Ichiro, head of the party)" (per an executive), has not made  any requests publicly so far for contributions from leading  industries. People in the economic circle are quite apprehensive  about "how the party is going to raise funds."    Having learned well the know-how of gathering contributions  during their days in the LDP, however, members of Shinseito have  been steadily "organizing their system."    On the morning of 3 March [1994] a meeting is going to be  held at Shinseito headquarters for the "yutakana jidosha-shakai  o suishinsuru giin renmei" [coalition of Dietmen to promote an  affluent automobile society]. It is to hear from representatives  from three industries -- taxi, trucking, and automobile repair  services -- on their "political wishes." The coalition is  composed of 68 members of reform-minded Shinseito Dietmen from  the upper and lower houses. Its chairman is Mr. Keiwa Okuda,  former minister of the Ministry of Transport [MOT], and its  secretary general is Mr. Shinya Izumi, a member of the upper  house and former MOT official.    People in the automobile industry predicts: "First, they are  trying to cement their relationship with the MOT-related  industries. Next will be us, in relation to the Ministry of  International Trade and Industry [MITI]." As this industry is  closely related to the LDP's Obuchi faction, the LDP can't  conceal its apprehension: "Shinseito is trying to squeeze in"  (per an executive of the LDP).    Between November and December last year, Shinseito had 10 or  so breakfast meetings at a city hotel, gathering each time the  chairman and other officials of each of various industry  associations. Various opinions and wishes on budget and tax  policies were communicated to Deputy General Secretary Kozo  Watanabe, former minister of MITI, and Mr. Moriyoshi Sato,  former chief of the National Land Agency, who is in charge of  finance and tax policies.    People in the economic circle still remember 1990 vividly  when Mr. Ozawa was the LDP general secretary and made strong  requests for support on general election campaigns to leading  industries, including the automobile industry, by-passing  Keidanren. One of Keidanren's vice chairmen says, "If he starts  doing that on an individual company basis, it will be  horrifying."  <H5>  Corporations Want To Avoid Sticking Out </H5>   The "umbrella of Keidanren as a middleman" (per Mr. Hiroshi  Goto, managing director of Japan Petrochemical Industry  Association) is gone. As the LDP requests the same amount of  contributions as before and three new parties enter the scene,  industries and corporations are unable to decide on "how much  money should be contributed to which party."    "Keidanren is not making a decision, so our association  can't  make a decision on allocation. We decided to let each company  decide" (per Mr. Higashi Tsuboi, chairman of the Fudosan Kyokai  [Real Estate Industry Association]).  "We are waiting for the next restructuring [of parties]. Even  if we make some contribution now, we don't know what will happen  in the future" (per Mr. Haruo Ito, managing director of Japan  Federation of Construction Contractors, Inc.).    Businesses want to avoid sticking out and are conscious of  the lateral unity. "They will feel more comfortable if Keidanren  makes decisions" (per one of the vice chairmen). The atmosphere  seems conducive to generating voices for reviving the  Keidanren's role as a middleman.  <H5>  [4 Mar 94 p 1] </H5>   [Text] On his flight on 11 February [1994] to Washington,  D.C., to attend a Japan-U.S. businessmen's conference, Mr. Ken  Nagano (chairman of Mitsubishi Materials) of Nikkeiren sat next  to Mr. Kosaku Inaba (president of Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy  Industries), chairman of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and  Industry.  <H5>  Renew a Meeting With the Prime Minister </H5>   Mr. Nagano: "How about having a monthly meeting between the  prime minister and the leaders of four economic associations?  The information the prime minister gets tends to be from  government offices only."    Mr. Inaba: "That seems like a good idea. Let's do it."    A meeting will begin after May when Mr. Shoichiro Toyoda,  chairman of Toyota Motor, becomes the chairman of Keidanren.    When the LDP was in power, the leaders of the four  associations used to have a breakfast meeting every month with  the party's four executives, including the secretary general, to  convey their wishes. After the change of administration, such  meetings were discontinued. There has been no regular meeting  with the executives of the coalition government.    "We don't have time to visit each of the coalition parties  individually. Although we are not quite sure how much power the  prime minister has in making policy decisions, we must rely on  him" (per a top business executive). Holding a regular meeting  with the prime minister is one way for the economic circle to  rebuild its relationship with the government.  <H5>  Mr. Ozawa Criticizes Top Executives </H5>   However, there is no unified way the parties in the  coalition  government look at the economic circle. When Mr. Ichiro Ozawa,  chief representative of Shinseito, had a study meeting with  executives from the financial sector on 17 February [1994], he  made a reference to the Japan-U.S. economic summit, which had  ended without any agreement on new economic framework talks, and  criticized strongly the attitude of leaders in the economic  circle toward Japan's current account surplus.    "(Reduction of the surplus) can be achieved by either using  numerical targets or strengthening the value of the yen. But  they don't like either of these approaches. If we don't start  working on restructuring the economic system, we will keep  having the same problems. Nothing will be solved. Current  leaders don't understand this at all." The executives gave him a  big nod.    Themes that the economic circle focuses on have gradually  shifted from "benefits for the entire economic circle" to  "reduction of corporate taxes" and "economic buoyancy."  Depending on industries, there seems to be much more conflict of  interests.    Among management in the steel, chemical, and textile  industries, some began to call for establishment of an  organization other than Keidanren to represent the interest of  the materials industry.    At a meeting of managing directors of four economic  associations on 6 February, Mr. Masaji Shinagawa (adviser at  Nippon Fire and Marine Insurance Company) of the Japanese  Association of Corporate Executives [Keizai Doyukai] said, "If  the people in the economic circle want deregulation, they should  be saying, `We will give up on special tax treatment if  corporate tax rates are reduced accordingly.'" Other attendants  were shocked, saying, "Not to that extent."    Under the LDP's reign, the economic circle contributed funds  to zoku-Dietmen through Keidanren as a pipeline, and obtained  such rewards as reduction of corporate tax and restriction on  tightening the Antimonopoly Law and environmental protection  regulations. At the core was "special tax treatment," and  contributions were like "entry fees" to participate in this  system (per a member of Keidanren).  <H5>  Uneasy About Independent Allocations </H5>   A person in charge of political funding at a large  manufacturing company seems worried. He says, "The reason why we  continued to make contributions is that we had absolution -- the  Keidanren was a middleman. Now that this absolution is gone, it  seems too much for a salaried man to use his judgment in  allocating funds to each party and to accept responsibility for  the consequences."    The uneasiness of corporations is also multiplied by a  possible class-action lawsuit by stockholders that can be  brought forth with only 8,200 yen and by the strengthening of  investigation by the National Tax Agency on unspecified expense  accounts.    Contributions through the Keidanren route were also  "membership dues" in the corporate society called "Japan, Inc."  that was structured like a pyramid.    The essential feature of the managed contribution was the  balance among the industries -- half of the total was  contributed by the five leading industries, such as electric  power and steel, and the remainder by other industries.  Maintenance of the order in such a corporate society was the  reason that the electric power industry, which received  criticism from the consumers and declared "discontinuance of  political contributions," began to pay contributions as  advertising expenses.    According to a top executive in the electric power industry,  Mr. Gaishi Hiraiwa was the chairman at the time when FEPCO began  "advertising contributions" around 1980. As chairman of the  Keidanren last year, he decided to stop playing the role of a  middleman for campaign contributions. It seems that he had to  close the curtain for the old system by himself, as corporate  managers saw the era of rapid economic growth ending, and had to  review the market share-oriented approach of their lateral  thinking.    The political circle is heading for restructuring at a rapid  pace. Unreversable crustal movements have also begun to be felt  by the economic circle</p>

			<p>Recent      Japanese press reporting has suggested that the Japanese  Government is attempting to enlist the support of the European  Union (EU) against U.S. efforts to force open Japanese markets,  particularly Washington's recent revival of the Super 301  provision of the 1988 Omnibus Trade Bill.  Minister of  International Trade and Industry Hiroshi Kumagai, for example,  appears to have used French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe's 31  March-3 April visit to Tokyo to coordinate Japanese and French  strategy toward any possible U.S. use of Super 301, which permits  Washington to identify countries that discriminate against U.S.  exports and impose sanctions if those countries fail to remove  barriers to U.S. products.  According to a 1 April Kyodo report,  Japanese officials reported that during a 1 April meeting,  Kumagai and Juppe agreed that Tokyo and Paris would "oppose  unilateral U.S. trade retaliation" such as that mandated by Super  301.  In comments suggesting that the two countries might attempt  to lobby against Super 301 during the upcoming 12-15 April  ministerial conference of the General Agreement on Tariffs and  Trade (GATT) in Marrakech, Morocco, Juppe reportedly told Kumagai  that he hoped retaliatory measures, such as Super 301, would be  abolished after GATT members sign the final accord of the Uruguay  Round of multilateral trade talks in Marrakech (Kyodo, 1 April).      Japanese media reporting about Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata's  plans for the Marrakech meeting also suggests that Tokyo has been  lining up European support against Super 301.  According to a 6  April Kyodo report, an undentified Japanese Government source  stated that, during meetings with U.S. Trade Representative  Mickey Kantor, Hata will urge Washington not to invoke Super 301  against Japan by citing European and Asian criticism of the  provision.  Hata may have solicited support from EU Commissioner  Sir Leon Brittan for this effort when, according to the 29 March  Mainichi Shimbun, Hata called Brittan on 29 March to explain the  Japanese market opening package announced that day.

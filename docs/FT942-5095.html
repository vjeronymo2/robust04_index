			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / Austrian tensions grow on EU The campaign leading up to next Sunday's referendum in Austria on European Union membership has reached fever pitch, as the latest opinion polls indicate the vote could go other either way. A poll taken in recent days indicated that 31 per cent of voters favoured joining, with a similar number opposed and 38 per cent undecided. The socialist-conservative coalition government has been betraying increasing signs of anxiety. The ATX index of 19 leading shares on the Vienna bourse has lost 5 per cent of its value in the past week, with investors jittery about the referendum outcome. In Norway, also a candidate for entry, resistance has reached new heights, just five months ahead of a national referendum, according to a poll published yesterday. Opposition to joining rose by one percentage point to 56 per cent, at the expense of support for membership which fell to 32 per cent from 33 per cent in May, the lowest level this year. Norway rejected membership in 1972 in a bitterly devisive referendum, but is to hold a new vote on November 28, after Austria and the other two applicants, Finland and Sweden.</p>

According to information obtained  by a Turkish Radio and Television correspondent from Kirikkale  Governor Sahabettin Harput, three shots were fired from the  passing car at Pehlivanli who was driving from Keskin to  Kirikkale. Pehlivanli was seriously injured in the head and he  died on the way to the hospital. Three other persons who were  in the car with him did not sustain any injuries in the attack.  It is reported that the car from which the shots were fired had  a fake license plate and that there were four persons in it.  Operations are continuing to capture the assailants. [passage  omitted on Pehlivanli's curriculum vitae]    ANAP leader Mesut Yilmaz went to Kirikkale following the  incident. He went to the hospital where Pehlivanli was taken  and was briefed on the incident by Harput and other officials.  In a statement at the hospital, Yilmaz said that there is a  high possibility that it is a political murder and that the  authorities concerned are continuing the investigation. Yilmaz  said: The incident is very distressing for us. We are  heartbroken. I extend my condolences to the people of Kirikkale  and ANAP circles.</p>

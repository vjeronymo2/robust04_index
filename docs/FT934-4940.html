			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Canadian fishermen face big cuts Cod fishing off Canada's east coast will come to a virtual halt next year if the government accepts a call by a conservation agency for drastic quota cuts to protect depleted stocks of cod and other species. The Fisheries Resource Conservation Council has urged an extension of a two-year moratorium on northern cod fishing off the coast of Newfoundland, as well as deep cuts in other areas. At the same time, it has questioned the ability of the North Atlantic Fishery Organisation to control over-fishing by foreign vessels in international waters. The FRCC recommends a total allowable catch for all species in 1994 about 60 per cent lower than last year. The cod and haddock quota would be less than 5 per cent of levels set in 1988. Mr Herbert Clarke, the council's chairman, warned that east coast groundfish stocks were at the lowest levels ever recorded. He said that the northern cod fishery, once one of the world's richest fishing grounds, was unlikely to reopen for at least 6-7 years. The precise causes of the fishery's decline are disputed, but are believed to include heavy over-fishing by Canadian and foreign vessels, as well as changes in water temperature and fish habitats. The decline in the fishery has already put at least 20,000 people out of work in Newfoundland and other Atlantic provinces. The proposed cutbacks are likely to cost several thousand more jobs. The government is expected to accept the bulk of the council's recommendations. Mr Brian Tobin, fisheries minister, said official policy would 'err on the side of caution'.</p>

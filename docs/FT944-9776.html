			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / International Company News: Inco to proceed with Indonesian expansion Inco, the world's biggest nickel producer, is going ahead with a USDollars 500m expansion at PT Inco, its 58 per cent-owned subsidiary in Indonesia. The project, which will boost PT Inco's annual production by half over the next six years to about 150m lbs of nickel, is part of the Canadian parent's plan to lift its production by 20 per cent by the end of the decade. Inco's output totalled 370m lbs in 1993, about one quarter of worldwide supplies. The expansion follows the go-ahead for several other projects at Inco's mines in the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Manitoba. The viability of these projects has been improved by a recent surge in nickel prices. The London Metal Exchange price has climbed from a low of Dollars 1.80 a lb in Sept 1993 to about Dollars 3.35 at the end of last week. The expansion at PT Inco, located in Sulawesi, will include the construction of a fourth smelting line at Soroako and additional hydro-electric generating capacity on the Larona River. Japan's Sumitomo Metal Mining owns 20 per cent of PT Inco, with the balance held by public shareholders and five other Japanese companies. PT Inco is one of the world's lowest-cost nickel producers, with about 25 years of reserves at planned production rates.</p>

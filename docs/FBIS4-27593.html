			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 30 (YONHAP) -- South Korea ranked third  behind Malaysia and Botswana among 114 countries that showed the  most progress in human development between 1986 and 1992,  according to an annual report by the United Nations Development  Program (UNDP) obtained here by YONHAP Monday.    East Asian countries, including Korea, also recorded the  fastest economic growth, with the report observing that "this  shows that the fast pace of economic growth in East Asia was  built on a solid foundation of human development."    The five-year human development report, published and  distributed in eight languages throughout the world, aims to  advance a new concept of human security and offers several  concrete proposals for the world summit for social development  in March 1995 in Copenhagen.    Canada ranked first in human development overall, while  Barbados was No. 1 among developing countries. South Korea  placed 32nd in the overall rankings and North Korea was 101st.    The other nations making up the top 10 in the global human  development index [HDI], which ranks 173 countries according to  life expectancy, educational attainment and basic purchasing  power, are Switzerland, Japan, Sweden, Norway, France,  Australia, the United States, the Netherlands, the United  Kingdom and Germany, in descending order.    The new index shows that Korea, following Malaysia and  Botswana, has made the most progress in human development since  1960.    "They started from very low levels, but managed as a group  to  increase their HDI values by around 80 percent," says the report.    The other countries among the top 10 performers in human  development since 1960 include Tunisia, Thailand, Syria, Turkey,  China, Portugal and Iran.    The report notes that foreign aid to developing countries  totaled 60 billion U.S. dollars in 1992, while 102 billion  dollars in private capital flowed into the "South" that year  compared to only 5 billion in 1970.    But nearly three-quarters of the capital went to just 10  countries -- China, Mexico, Malaysia, Argentina, Thailand,  Indonesia, Brazil, Nigeria, Venezuela and Korea -- while just 6  percent went to Sub-Saharan Africa and 2 percent to the least  developed nations.    Developing countries paid 160 billion dollars in debt  service  charges in 1992, more than two and a half times the official aid  and 10 billion dollars more than private financial flows.    The report says that debt servicing is hampering developing  countries' ability to meet urgent human development needs, and  suggests cancelling the debts of the poorest nations in return  for a pledge that they earmark those same funds for social  development.    The 1994 report points out that widespread human insecurity  is a universal problem -- the poor nations are more concerned  about hunger and disease, while the rich states focus on drugs  and crime. Thus the concern for human insecurity is global.    Nevertheless, spending to protect borders outstrips outlays  to protect individuals within or across borders, the report  notes.    Observing that several poor nations are spending much more  on  arms than on education and health, it charges that those  encouraging the weapons trade in developing countries are  responsible for the world's security policy -- the five  permanent members of the U.N. Security Council.    Saying the acquisition of more arms only aggravates existing  human deprivations, the report lists China, India, Korea,  Malaysia, Nigeria and Pakistan as recent buyers and explains how  much it really costs them in terms of their unmet social agendas.    For example, Korea ordered 28 missiles from America,  spending  an amount that could have been used to immunize all of its  120,000 unimmunized children and provide safe water to 3.5  million people.</p>

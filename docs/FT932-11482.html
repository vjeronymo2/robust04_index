			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / Letter: Effective learning and accuracy in school tests In his article on 'Hidden flaws in school testing' (April 29), Lord Skidelsky argues that we should separate the two functions of assessment and testing. His vision is that externally set tests should be used to pass judgments on teachers' performance, while assessments designed to support learning should be left to schools. A national assessment system 'simplified' in this way promises to reduce the burden of testing on schools. There are several reasons why the Task Group on Assessment and Testing did not recommend such a system in its 1988 report. Short external tests are likely to give unreliable results, placing a substantial proportion of pupils in the wrong grades or levels. The School Examinations and Assessment Council does not have a research programme to determine the possible error in the current national tests. In view of research evidence about error in such tests, this is unacceptable - the public needs to have such evidence. National assessment results are not only used to judge teachers, they give important evidence about every individual pupil; errors mean both that injustice is done and that inaccurate guidance is given about learning needs. A further reason is that short and apparently simple tests cannot measure important outcomes of learning, yet they have a strong influence on teaching. Given that test results are to be used to judge them, teachers are bound to direct their teaching to maximise test scores. This usually reduces to drilling pupils to produce short answers to sets of questions, each of which tests small fragments of knowledge devoid of any purposeful context. The evidence about pupils' learning is that such an approach is harmful. A recent survey of science teachers on the effects of testing at age 14 in 1992 revealed that most believe that those tests have had the narrowing and negative effects on their teaching that could have been predicted. However, it should not be necessary to research the damage in our own schools to test the argument. Most of the state testing systems in the US have been using, for many years, the type of approach that Lord Skidelsky is recommending. Most of them are now abandoning this 'economical' testing and engaging in programmes to develop 'authentic' forms of assessment which will involve classroom assessments by teachers in close relationship to formative assessment. The reason for their considerable investment in such changes is quite simple. Their experience of the short external tests has been that they give poor policy information and inaccurate evidence about individual teachers and pupils, while at the same time they exert pressures which damage good learning practices.

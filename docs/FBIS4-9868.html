			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 25 Mar (PL) -- The first full session  between Cuban and Netherlands businessmen concluded today with  the recommendation to both governments to sign a document  protecting investments and increasing trade between both nations.    The result of previous contacts turned into a $50-million  credit granted to Cuba by the Bank of Curacao. This amount is  earmarked mainly for the Cuban nickel and sugar industries,  Willem C. Van't Wout [name as received], chief of the  Netherlands delegation, told PRENSA LATINA.    He also reported that he has signed a letter of intent  between the Cuban tourist institutions and the Netherlands hotel  group the Golden Tulip. The group has committed to building  five hotels with a $75-million investment.    Van't Wout and Ariel Maso, chief of the Cuban delegation,  signed a protocol of the meeting's minutes that will be followed  up next year in the Netherlands.    Both executives expressed their satisfaction with the  seriousness and cordiality that characterized the negotiations.    Maso, director of the Cubaniquel [Cuban nickel] Company,  labeled the Netherlands kingdom as one of Cuba's most important  access doors to the EU.    William C. Van't Wout, who has been negotiating with Cuba  for  26 years, said that three-quarters of the Netherlands mission on  this occasion was made up of businessmen who were visiting the  island for the first time.    The executive announced that specific results of the first  session are still abstract although they allow for future  businesses, particularly in the construction and dredging of  ports.    Among this missions' participants were representatives of  several large banks, as well as trade companies interested in  investing in production for the local market.    Van't Wout was questioned on his role in the presence of  Netherlands buses on Havana streets, to which he replied that  the operation was the result, in part, of a donation by  Rotterdam municipality, while other buses were sold at low  prices.    The Netherlands mission met during their stay with Isabel  Allende, deputy foreign minister; Ernesto Melendez, minister  president of the State Committee for Economic Cooperation;  Orlando Hernandez, vice minister of foreign trade; Abraham  Maciques, president of the Cubanacan Corporation; and Carlos  Martinez Salsamendi, Chamber of Commerce president.</p>

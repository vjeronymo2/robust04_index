I didn't have a lid for the bowl and I knew the beans would, no doubt,  spill in my car on the way.  </P> <P> Then I remembered how plastic wrap clings to the sides of any glass bowl when  heated in the microwave oven. I heated the beans on HIGH (100%) for a couple of  minutes and the plastic wrap created a tight seal so the beans didn't make a  mess.  </P> <P> Some of the lids on my casserole dishes aren't very tight, so this tip could  also be used to make sure food doesn't spill while being transported even when  it has a lid. Also, the plastic wrap seal keeps the food hot longer.  </P> <P>  -- KELLY, Chandler, Ariz.  </P> <P> DEAR KEITH: There is an easy solution to this. Just mix one cup of rubbing  alcohol to a quart of water and use this solution on the cloth when cleaning  the freezer. Since rubbing alcohol will not freeze, the cloth will not stick.  </P> <P>  -- HELOISE  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: My mother-in-law told me the best way to make poached eggs. First  of all, spray the pan lightly with a non-stick vegetable spray, fry the eggs  until the whites are barely set, then add about one tablespoon of water. Cover  tightly and turn the heat down very low.  </P> <P> The result is a semi-poached egg that is not greasy and there is no turning  needed.  </P> <P>  -- RUTH, Honeoye, N.Y.  </P> <P>  Send a time- or money-saving hint to Heloise, P.O. Box 795000, San Antonio,  Tex. 78279. Letters will not be answered personally, but the best hints  received will be used in the Hints From Heloise column.  </P> <P> </P></p>

This is an interesting question. First, it believes that  Frelimo is not interested in elections being held in October, as  scheduled.    The reasons for thinking so?    Afonso Dhlakama replied that the Frelimo Party "is making  time to try and change its Marxist image."    In his interview, the Renamo leader also reexamined the  stance he defended at one stage, that the electoral process  should be organized with the troops being confined.    He explains that his views were poorly understood at the  time. This is an interview in which Afonso Dhlakama tried to  make himself understood...    In your opinion, Mr. Afonso Dhlakama, why is the troop  confinement process lagging behind? Is it or is it not a  political problem?    [Dhlakama] I am going to make a serious accusation. I do not  think that Frelimo would like to participate in the October  elections. To them, that will be much too early.    [Santos] Do you think that Frelimo is not ready?    [Dhlakama] Yes, I think that they are not ready. They have  been caught by surprise. Frelimo needs more time to try and  improve its image.    [Santos] What image is that?    [Dhlakama] Its Marxist image. The party has to change from a  Marxist to a democratic party with new ideas. The problem is  that it has only a short time in which to do so.    Concerning the troop confinement process, they too are aware  that, in terms of what we have agreed, elections cannot be held  with two armies still in place. Both the Mozambican people and  the international community want only one unified army by the  time elections are held...    [Santos] But, Mr. Dhlakama, you once defended the view that  elections should be held with the troops being confined....    [Dhlakama] I did not insist on that point. What happened was  that I was misunderstood. What I said was: "given that Frelimo  is complicating things and that Renamo wants elections by  October, we could go to elections even with two armies."    [Santos] And how would that leave the troops, in terms of  command?    [Dhlakama] Renamo has had and has now the capacity to tell  its troops not to disturb the process. That was what I said  and, because I am aware of the dangers, I never insisted on  going to elections without the troops being confined.    However, now I want to accuse Frelimo of resorting to  tactics  aimed at delaying the electoral process. They want to gain time.    [Santos] Why would they want to do that?    [Dhlakama] They know that there will be no elections in  October unless the new army has been formed. And because there  will be no elections in October, we will have to postpone.  [sentence as published] Postpone to when? To November? The rains  begin in November, so they will have to be moved to 1995. And  when will they take place in 1995? In January? You still have  rains then. It also rains in February, March, and April.  Perhaps we will only have elections by May of next year.    [Santos] So, Mr. Afonso Dhlakama, your opinion is that  Frelimo only wants elections to be held next year?    [Dhlakama] You can be sure about that. That is the way many  Frelimo members want it, but that is extremely dangerous.  Speaking as a Mozambican rather than as Renamo leader, I feel  that that situation is extremely dangerous.    [Santos] Why do you perceive it to be dangerous?    [Dhlakama] We have already been warned by the international  community that it will withdraw its observers because they  cannot remain eternally involved in the UN Operations in  Mozambique. What happens is that the money will run out. They  have planned for everything to have been done by the end of  October. By delaying things, they would have maximum certainty  that the United Nations will pull out and there is bound to be  confusion once there are no observers. I am afraid of such a  situation and that is why I would like to call on my brethren in  government to accelerate the confinement process.    [Santos] And what about Renamo?    [Dhlakama] I am ready. For instance, our General Mateus  Ngonhamo will leave on Monday to inspect the assembly areas, to  select 2,500 men for the new army and to see when the training  of the 5,000 men will get under way.    [Santos] That means, then, that Renamo already has men ready  to join the Mozambique Defense Armed Forces, FADM?    [Dhlakama] It has and that is no political propaganda,  either. We are going to the assembly areas where more men have  been confined.    [Santos] Those men will be chosen to go to Nacala?    [Dhlakama] I do not know where they will undergo their  training. That is another problem. Frelimo is also delaying  the rehabilitation of the training camps. Nothing has been  done about that yet. Nothing, really nothing. That task has  been turned over to the Mozambican Government. Immediately when  we had signed the General Peace Accord, it became clear that the  Mozambican Government would be responsible for rehabilitating  the training centers. However, nothing has happened so far. We  are going to apply pressure, the people are going to apply  pressure, and the international community will also apply  pressure because we do not want this to fail.    For instance, we do not have the money to go to elections,  but we have to go to elections. They are worth being held.    [Santos] This trip (we were on the eve of his departure) you  are about to make to South Africa, will it be to gather funds  for the elections?    [Dhlakama] No, absolutely not. This trip is part of routine  visits to all neighboring countries. Last year, I went to  Botswana and to Zambia. I am preparing visits to Namibia,  Tanzania, and Swaziland. Now, this visit to South Africa is  very important because it occurs shortly before that country is  due to hold its first multiracial elections.    [Santos] In concrete terms, what are you going to do in  South  Africa?    [Dhlakama] I would like to hold talks with some opposition  parties, with the most important party in South Africa -- that  is the African National Congress, ANC -- so that the ANC gets to  know Renamo better. In addition to that, I intend meeting South  African businessmen. At this stage, there are many South  African businessmen here, but they are only investing in favor  of the government. As an opposition force, we do need to know  who is investing in the country. So, I am going to hold talks  with them to know what investments can be made in the future.  So far, only the South African Government and Frelimo have  participated in investment talks. This is why we want to come  into the game now and learn what their policy is with regard to  investments in our country.    [Santos] Is that for them to invest in areas controlled by  Renamo?    [Dhlakama] Nothing like that. You must keep it mind that  only a few months separate us from elections and that it would  be pointless for the Renamo leader to be urging people to invest  in Renamo-controlled areas now. The fact is that those areas  are disappearing!    [Santos] The advisers to the provincial governors have  already been appointed. Will their appointments facilitate the  administrative integration of Renamo-controlled areas?    [Dhlakama] The famous list of provincial governor advisers  has already been handed over, but they have not been sworn in  yet. I think that as soon as President Chissano returns (the  Mozambican head of state was in Switzerland, at the time), they  will be sworn in and they will be able to start working with the  governors, thereby making it easier for the provincial governors  to get acquainted with statistics and with probems in their  provinces.    So, Renamo is no longer interested in asking for investments  for its areas. Our interest is to talk with them, to learn how  they plan to invest in the future, in a country that is already  democratic.    [Santos] Mr. Afonso Dhlakama: going back to the issue of  elections, how much would your party have to participate in  elections?    [Dhlakama] I cannot say what the amount would be. I know  that journalists complicate things a great deal.... The fact is,  I cannot say how much, but it is not easy, nor is it good for  Renamo to create the impression that we are begging for money.    Renamo does not beg for money. In concrete terms, it asks  for the means for the party to create its own infrastructure.  By talking about money, we would be creating a poor image for  ourselves. For instance, when I talk about the party's  infrastructure, I mean I want houses, but if I have money, I can  buy the keys and get houses. That is why either houses or money  will do. Another example is that I would like the money to buy  vehicles, but I cannot go about always asking for money. If a  country makes available, for instance, 25 vehicles, 45 Land  Rover vehicles, I shall say thank you very much, because that  will be more than $1 million. What happens here is that we do  not say so many millions of dollars, because then we would be  confusing the international community and we would be creating a  negative image for Renamo, which would then seem to be  constantly begging for money.    [Santos] That means, then, that Renamo is not asking for  money?    [Dhlakama] Renamo is not asking for money. Renamo is  complaining about a lack of means to build infrastructure to  allow the party to function. Now, someone could indeed give us  money, somebody else could give us a typewriter, and somebody  else could give us vehicles.    [Santos] Could that be a reason for Renamo to delay the  process: the lack of human and material means? In fact, a  government official has said that Renamo is the one that is not  ready and that it is looking for cadres. Is this true?    [Dhlakama] How can Frelimo prove that, when I am stating  here  that I have more troops confined, even though my forces are  facing terrible conditions? My soldiers have had to go 200, 150  km in terrible conditions, barefoot, through Mozambique's  jungle, to reach their assembly areas. That fact is obvious  proof that they want elections held this year.    Who does not want the troops to be confined? It is the  government! The government is confining its forces in villages.  Its forces only have to move some 500 meters. It is near their  barracks. When the government says that it does not have the  means to take its troops to the assembly areas, any child  promptly realizes that that is not a valid argument. It is  nothing. If Frelimo wanted to do so, it could confine 30,000  men in their assembly areas in 24 hours.    [Santos] Was nothing planned concerning the movement of  Renamo troops to their assembly areas?    [Dhlakama] No, that had not been planned or discussed  before,  but it was generally said that Unomoz would make transportation  available -- but there you have it, our troops are going on  foot. Nevertheless, the most important thing is that they are  arriving at their assembly areas.    I would like to touch again on that issue of Renamo drafting  cadres. The fact is, there is nobody that is not looking for  cadres. Frelimo itself is drafting cadres! We are seeing new  faces in the Frelimo Party, they are being sworn in. Yet that  should not be an impediment to elections. We were already  drafting cadres when we were still in the bush. Frelimo itself  may have been in power for 18 years, but it is still changing  ministers and it grabbing people who complete their university  studies. It is not just Renamo that is doing so. Everybody is  doing it.    [Santos] Does Renamo have enough cadres to fill the seats  that it may eventually have in Parliament?    [Dhlakama] Renamo has enough cadres at this stage to be  candidates in the Assembly and, should Renamo win the upcoming  elections, it has already organized people to participate in  government.</p>

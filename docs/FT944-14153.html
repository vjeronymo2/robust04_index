			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / Indian temple plea rejected India's highest court yesterday rejected a presidential request for an opinion on whether an ancient temple had existed at the site of a mosque in Ayodhya demolished by militant Hindus in 1992, and upheld the central government's acquisition of 67 surrounding acres of land. The Supreme Court decision will force the government to resolve the issue of the Ayodhya site claimed by Hindus and Moslems. The government had been unable to decide whether a temple or a mosque will be built on the site and had hoped the court would solve the problem.

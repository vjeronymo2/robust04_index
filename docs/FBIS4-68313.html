			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Semen Ivanov and Veronika Romanenkova, ITAR-TASS </F> correspondents: "There Will Be a Cosmodrome in the Taiga"]    [Text] By the year 2000 Russia will have still another  cosmodrome in the Far East, designated by the interim name  "Vostochnyy," in the neighborhood of Svobodnyy. In contrast to  Plesetsk, from the new cosmodrome it will be possible to launch  boosters of the heavy Proton class, but they will be  ecologically clean variants. This was stated in an interview to  an ITAR-TASS correspondent by Colonel-General Vladimir Ivanov,  commander of the Russian military space forces.    The end of the "cold war" and the disarmament which is now  taking place has brought to the brink of extinction the once  most powerful type of armed forces, the Strategic Rocket Forces,  which this year marks its 35th anniversary. Under the conditions  of the agreement on the reduction of strategic offensive weapons  (START II) signed by the presidents of Russia and the United  States at Sochi on 3 January 1993, the two great powers are  continuing the disarmament process, thereby reducing the  confrontation to a lower level.    Under the agreement, before the year 2003 all surface  intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) in Russia will be  liquidated, including the heavy RS-20 (SS-18), in the United  States also called the Satan, which beyond the ocean had caused  the greatest anxiety. As a result of implementation of these  agreements among the seven types of ICBMs only one type will  remain in Russia -- the RS-12M (SS-25), both mobile and  stationary. The first missiles to be destroyed will be those  developed and constructed at an earlier time -- the RS-16  (SS-11), RS-12 (SS-13) and RS-16 (SS-17). In order not to leave  the impression that there is a unilateral disarmament of Russia,  it also must be noted that American ICBMs also will be destroyed  or reoutfitted.    By the beginning of 21st century some of the 20 Russian  regions of deployment of the offensive missile complexes of the  Strategic Rocket Forces now in existence will cease to be. These  will include first of all the Vershet (Perm Oblast), Drovyanaya  and Yasnaya (Chita Oblast), Kostroma, Krasnoyarsk and Svobodnyy  (Amur Oblast) regions.    Until recently Svobodnyy remained the most eastern region of  deployment. The armament there consisted of the RS-10 ICBM,  aimed at the United States. This single-warhead 17-m missile  with a launching weight of more than 50 tons carried a nuclear  charge of 1.1 megaton, which is 50 times greater than the power  of the bomb dropped at Hiroshima by the United States in 1945.    So it happened that a wise government decision to reoutfit a  defense facility at Plesetsk into a space facility was made  almost 30 years ago -- in 1964. Now, after all the years have  passed, a similar decision has been made with respect to  reductions of the rocket division at Svobodnyy, which was going  under the knife. As a result, the Svobodnyy facility will be  retained, but it will play a different role -- as the Main  Center for Testing and Use of Space Equipment (TsIPKS).    A little more than two weeks remain to the meeting of the  presidents of Russia and Kazakhstan, planned for the end of  March, which in many respects can and must be important. Because  the documents signed as a result of this meeting -- especially  with respect to the Baykonur cosmodrome (contract and  agreement), as well as with respect to military-technical  cooperation, should determine the future relations of the two  countries in these fields up to the beginning of the 21st  century.    The interests of the defense capability and safety of Russia  cannot and must not in any way be made dependent on the policy  of another state, even if it is a friendly state which is part  of the CIS. Precisely this has dictated the striving of Russia  to have its own cosmodrome; Svobodnyy was selected as the final  location (initially three possible variants were examined). A  well-built residential city of rocket forces, a hospital and  other infrastructure facilities costing several hundreds of  millions of rubles, which now, it seems, is to receive a "second  wind," are already here and the rocket forces, performing their  military duties, will launch boosters and spacecraft into space.    It is proposed that two launch facilities for heavy boosters  of the Proton type, but new, ecologically clean variants, will  be constructed in the neighborhood of Svobodnyy.    Unfortunately, the short-sighted position of the Russian  Space Agency (RSA), not fully taking the interests of Russia  into account, precluded the participation of Plesetsk in  implementing the project for constructing the Alpha  international orbital station. This position scarcely can be  justified by the "youth" of the RSA, recently marking its second  anniversary. After all, the governmental males standing at the  "space helm" have gone through the real "Momovskaya school"  (Ministry of General Machine Building [MOM]). Nevertheless, the  Alpha project approved by them is completely oriented on  Baykonur. But under the conditions of nonfinalization of the  negotiations with Kazakhstan with respect to Baykonur,  complicated by the on-again off-again approach of that  independent state, the international project will be  considerably more difficult to implement from the purely  political point of view.    Therefore, in order for Russia to carry out an independent  space policy and to ensure guaranteed access to space Russia has  been forced, using the existing infrastructure, to proceed to  the reoutfitting and construction of a new cosmodrome in the Far  East where more than three thousand rocket troops now serve.</p>

			<p><P> August 16, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ SMITH: TRUMP SAYS HE'S HUMBLE AND THAT THE PRESS LIES  </P> <P> "I THINK that I'm a rather -- and you will be surprised -- but I can be a  rather humble person, if I want to be, if I feel I'm in the right environment.  You're always guarded. I'm not going to let my guard down because you happen to  be asking me questions. You're somebody I know and have a great respect for,  but I'm not going to let my guard down because Barbara's here, asking me  questions."  </P> <P> This is Donald Trump speaking to Barbara Walters in the interview she will air  this Friday over ABC's "20/20."  </P> <P> I ASKED Barbara to describe the atmosphere of her meeting with the tycoon in  his offices in the Trump Tower. Once upon a time, Donald and Barbara seemed to  be friends, but it's no secret around New York that he has blasted her as  "being on Ivana's side." Still, Trump has a new book to promote -- "Surviving  At The Top" -- and I guess he felt he'd get a fair shake from Walters.  </P> <P> The feeling in his office may have changed somewhat, but not the decor. The  walls are lined with framed national and international magazines that made  Trump their cover boy in the past. But there isn't a single Trump cover since  the decline, though he has been on many magazines. Barbara notes that what  Donald has in real abundance is stunning secretaries and receptionists -- "each  one better looking than the one before."  </P> <P> And he is faithfully attended by his loyal assistant, Norma Ferderer, who just  happens to be one of the nicest, fairest-minded and most sensible persons ever  to sit in the eye of a storm.  </P> <P> TRUMP BLAMES the press, with whom he is simply furious, and he blames the  general economic turn-down for all his troubles. The most interesting thing he  says in the interview is that the U.S. is not in a recession, but IN A  DEPRESSION! So, he says he "has to roll with the punches." But Trump insists he  has made "great deals" with the banks and will ultimately be victorious.  </P> <P> On the matter of the press, Trump says: "I hope the general public understands  how inherently dishonest the press in this country is . . . what the press has  done is taken a situation where they see something and blown it to kingdom  come. . . . I have never seen press reporting as I have with regard to me."  </P> <P> DONALD SAYS that his wife, Ivana, is a good mother and he refuses "to disparage  her." But he doesn't respond, or deny, when Walters questions him about his  relationship with his 12-year-old son, Donnie. (Barbara notes he and the boy  have not talked since last May.) Donald defends the pre-nuptial agreement he  and Ivana signed and characterizes her actions like this: "Ivana decided to sue  me on it, brilliantly decided to sue me on it."  </P> <P> He adds, "She's not going to win the suit."  </P></p>

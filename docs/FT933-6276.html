			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: TSB/EuroDollar If Forte's sale of Gardner Merchant last December was a sign that the management buy-out was not dead, TSB's disposal of its EuroDollar car rental business shows that buy-outs continue to enjoy a quiet recovery. That is not surprising for this stage of the cycle. Managers who purchase a business now are buying into the recovery. Low interest rates make it easier to satisfy the rigorous cash-flow requirements imposed by banks. Lenders themselves are selective, but more are finding the high margins on buy-outs attractive given the squeeze on their net interest income. The EuroDollar deal had some special attractions. Since car rental is way outside TSB's banking and insurance focus, the bank was not particularly minded to quibble about the price. Assuming the new owners can sort out the foreign subsidiaries, they will be left with a lucrative business bought at only a small premium over its value in TSB's books. With leasing finance available for the rental fleet, the buy-out syndicate did not need to borrow on its own account. Yet more conventional deals also now enjoy a good chance. The main constraint is size, since lenders are reluctant to see gearing rise much above 50 per cent. Large, highly-geared deals like Isosceles and Magnet thus remain out of the question. Banks will need time - and probably a hefty dose of inflation as well - to forget the pain they caused.</p>

			<p>920109 FT  09 JAN 92 / World Trade News: UK signs Pounds 500m accord for Kuwait export credits BRITAIN yesterday signed an agreement making available Pounds 500m in export credits for Kuwait, writes Anthony McDermott. The medium-term credit, signed by Mr Tim Sainsbury, UK trade minister (left), and Mr Abdullah al-Gabandi, the managing-director of the Kuwait Investment Authority, is to be managed by the Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD), and should provide welcome backing for UK companies in winning contracts for the Dollars 20bn (Pounds 10.7bn) effort to rebuild Kuwait after Iraq's invasion in 1990. Since Kuwait's liberation last February, UK companies have won deals worth Pounds 491.6m, amounting to about 20 per cent of contracts on offer. This deal follows similar agreements that Kuwait has concluded with such countries as the US, which has won the cream of the contracts, Canada, Japan, and other countries in the EC. On returning from a visit to Kuwait last November, Mr Sainsbury said that while building contracts were not as substantial as first thought, many re-supplying orders were available in telecommunications, electronic equipment and vehicles. This re-stocking could take three to five years. Financing should not be a problem with Kuwaiti oil production reaching pre-invasion levels of 1.5m barrels a day by the end of this year.</p>

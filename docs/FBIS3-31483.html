The new provision requires that the chairmen of the Supreme  Court of Cassation and the Supreme Administrative Court, the  prosecutor-general and the director of the National  Investigative Service have 14-year service in the legal  profession, of which at least five years as judges, prosecutors  or investigators. According to jurists, the incumbent  prosecutor-general Ivan Tatarchev and Supreme Court Chairman  Ivan Grigorov, both of them lawyers, are ineligible for a second  term. Thus only people linked to the former Communist Party  will qualify for the top positions in the judiciary.    Asked by BTA what will become of the lawsuits against the  culprits for Bulgaria's economic catastrophe if he is dismissed,  Tatarchev said in his view they would sink into oblivion.    Supreme Court Chairman Ivan Grigorov said the full  recommunization of all areas yesterday hit the judiciary. "God  save the non-Communists in Bulgaria," Grigorov added.    The new provision was sponsored by Asen Michkovski MP of the  New Union for Democracy. Zlatka Ruseva, deputy floor leader of  the Union of Democratic Forces (SDS), described it as  discriminatory and aimed at recommunization. She said the SDS  would approach the Constitutional Court with a request to repeal  the law.    The bill is unlikely to be enacted in the near future,  according to MP's, because many points remain to be debated.</p>

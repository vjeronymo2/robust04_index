			<p>BFN     [Text] Independent and party members of the opposition to  the Oslo accord are experiencing a state of euphoria and a sense  of victory over the accord and its supporters and their  conviction that the Palestinians have lost all their weapons.    Informed sources believe the military escalation by Hamas  and  the Islamic Jihad has increased the popularity of Palestinian  opposition to the Oslo accord in general. The sources told  AL-HAYAH the increase in the popularity of any faction is not in  the interest of the Alliance of Palestinian Forces (the 10  factions) as an alliance. Rather, it is in the interest of some  factions, especially the factions that took practical steps and  did not confine their opposition to slogans and rhetoric.    The sources point out that the 'Afula, Ashdod, and Hadera  operations carried out by Hamas and the Islamic Jihad, which are  part of the alliance, have revitalized the two factions only and  not the entire alliance. The alliance as a whole has so far  failed to come up with any concrete plans. In fact, ideological  differences relating to views and objectives have been apparent  in practice and bolstered each faction's separate view of the  Palestine question and its endeavor to achieve its factional  objectives.    At any rate, the sources continue, the recent military  actions have somewhat enhanced the image of the opposition and  improved its situation, having reached a different stage in the  recent months when Palestinian negotiators were conducting  negotiations in Cairo about the stages of the administrative  self-rule and making steps in this direction, regardless of the  nature of these steps and agreement or disagreement with them.    The sources say the autonomy negotiations on the one hand  and  the opposition's inaction on the other have given rise to a  third current in the recent four months that followed the  signing of the Oslo accord. This third current rejects both  attitudes.    Dr. Fathi al-Shaqaqi, secretary general of the Islamic Jihad  Movement, told AL-HAYAH "those who were misled and thought we  could do nothing are mistaken. We can strike hard. This is our  practical choice in the current stage. When the movement  carried out the Ashdod operation, the people regained confidence  in us and in our ability to stage confrontation. We proved that  we are not helpless. Therefore, the battle with the occupation  will continue."    He added that after six months of the Oslo accord, the  Palestinian man in the street has become bored of rhetoric that  does not do anything. However, the situation is now different.</p>

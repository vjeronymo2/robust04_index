			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Seiha: "The Royal Government Must Review Its </F> Economic Policy"]    [Text] Cambodia's economy is deteriorating to an alarming  extent. Everyone knows that Cambodia needs a huge sum of money  for national rehabilitation and reconstruction, and that its  main income comes from customs duties and taxes. Declining  economic activity -- with a huge plunge in imports and exports  -- has caused the country's income to drop by about 50 percent.  This is the official figure announced by Economy and Finance  Minister Sam Rangsi. This decline will certainly upset the  Ministry of Economy and Finance's plan to seek 361 billion riels  in income for the current fiscal year.    In addition to the decline in export-import activity,  foreign  investment in general has not grown since it was permitted by  the Royal Government. Although there has been no official  announcement regarding foreign investment statistics, the facts  show various companies that previously invested in Cambodia have  withdrawn part of their funds and have turned to investment in  Vietnam. Meanwhile, other companies that planned to invest in  Cambodia have maintained a wait-and-see attitude.    In addition to the political situation in the country, Mr.  Sam Rangsi admitted that Vietnam's opening up to free import  marketing and Thailand's reduction of its import taxes have also  caused Cambodian exports to drop. Moreover, traders feel bad  about a number of new principles recently announced by the  Ministry of Economy and Finance. Thus, there is sufficient  reason to say that Vietnam's opening up has caused the decline  in investment in Cambodia.    Another heavy burden for the Royal Government is the recent  verbal attacks and conflicts along the Cambodian-Thai border,  which have caused the closure of the border at Poipet. This  closure has badly affected the Cambodian economy and added a  heavy burden to the daily livelihoods of the Cambodian people.    Moreover, although Sam Rangsi did not mention the fourth  cause of the decline in state income, everyone well knows about  it; that is, corruption among those who rule the state and  control the national economy.    How will the government solve the present situation? It is  true that the political situation has impacted on Cambodia's  economic situation. But some have criticized Cambodia for  having a serious crisis in state control over economic affairs.  This requires an urgent remedy. Efforts should also be made to  find a control mechanism that can stimulate economic activities.    The time has come for the Royal Government to take a look at  itself in a new mirror to see whether or not its economic policy  has caused the decline of the national economy.    It is believed that this economic crisis -- if not remedied  in time -- will be more dangerous than the downfall on the  Pailin battlefield.</p>

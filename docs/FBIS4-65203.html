			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by Martin S. Lambeck: "Success for Yeltsin"] </F>   [Text] Helmut Kohl has helped his Russian friend Boris  Yeltsin achieve a great and visible success during his state  visit. Moscow will certainly acknowledge the outcome of this  visit with satisfaction: The Germans are no longer insisting on  a ceremony in Weimar. The Russian troops will be seen off in  Berlin for the whole of 31 August -- with a celebration such as  the one staged to say farewell to the Western allies in Berlin  yesterday.    On an international level, the chancellor has committed  himself to helping Moscow. Germany wants to bring about Russian  membership in the European Council, although some criticism has  already been voiced by that organization. Furthermore, Germany  wants Russia to be included as a major economic nation. Whether  the other partners will agree to the G-7 being extended to G-8  remains to be seen.    Yeltsin made hardly any concessions: No decision has been  made on a German consulate in Kaliningrad; no success has been  achieved in the tiresome matter of returning German cultural  assets. The only field where positive signals came from  Yeltsin's side was NATO's Partnership for Peace program.    Kohl's success during this visit is of an atmospheric  nature.  The cordial embraces he shared with Yeltsin indicate the  closeness of relations between the key European powers, Germany  and Russia. This basis can be used for working on unsolved  problems.</p>

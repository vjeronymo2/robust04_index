			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by President Milan Kucan in the State Chamber in </F> Ljubljana-- live]    [Excerpts] Esteemed Mr. Chairman, honored ladies and  gentlemen deputies, honored house: Your conclusion to invite me  and thus allow me to explain my statements about possible  scenarios of political events in Slovenia, of which I have  allegedly spoken in public, demands a little explanation first.  Nowhere have I ever spoken of any scenarios of political events  in Slovenia and for this reason such an explanation is not  possible. In light of the debate at the 28 March extraordinary  session of the State Chamber, I presume that these were my  statements made at the deputies' evening in Nova Gorica, which  was on 23 February. Your conclusion, that is to say, demand  allows me to use my constitutional right and duty to tell this  high house, and through it the wider public, how I view the  situation in Slovenia, that is to say, how I viewed it in Nova  Gorica. I decided to appear in person because I feel firmly  bound by my constitutional responsibility and the moral  obligations that I have as a president of the state to draw  attention to the issues concerning the observation of  constitutionality and legality, the protection of human rights,  and internal political stability and security of the state. I  believe it is not sufficient for me to send my opinions,  warnings, initiatives, and proposals only to the incumbent  ministers, the government, and the State Chamber, but find it  necessary and warranted to address the public, too, and warn it  about the tendencies and the occurrences that are, in my  opinion, deeply harmful for the interests of the citizens of our  state, its stability and future, and its position and reputation  in the world. I have no direct authority to resolve these  issues. However, with a public word I wish to assist in a  creative release of social tensions attached to the fundamental  questions of the state and in the resolution of the existential  problems of the Slovene citizens, especially the problems of  their social and legal security. [passage omitted]    Even though I have explained the contents, the meaning, and  the aims of this appearance [in Nova Gorica] in the media on  several occasions I shall do this once again in front of the  State Chamber. However, I do not understand why my appearance in  Nova Gorica was not presented adequately in the media, if it  really gave rise to so many doubts, questions, and also  manipulations and misinterpretations. It is interesting to note  that even those who concerned themselves the most with this  message have failed to do so. Had this been the case, the  Slovene citizens would have learned, as is their right, what the  president of the republic actually said. They would form their  own judgment about what was said, without middlemen and  interpreters, especially those who can merely think in terms of  dark scenarios and major conspiracies. This is a matter of  conscience and responsibility of those people who are building  their political work on deliberate falsification and disrespect  for authenticity. If anyone recognizes his own pattern of  thinking and behavior in my critical warning that a highly  disturbing belief that objectives justify the means is gaining  prominence in our political practice, then this is a matter of  his conscience and also a matter of his responsibility for the  damage done to society. This is a responsibility for deliberate  falsification and violation of the authenticity of the spoken  word, or to say it directly, some people have obviously taken  lies for proofs.    My assessments and warnings put forward in Nova Gorica  referring to cases of unlawful behavior and social anomalies and  tendencies in political life were not the first of their kind.  I have spoken similarly on several occasions before. However,  because of the thoroughness and credibility of the information  which was published publicly there were no manipulations,  fabrications, and speculations with my words then. My speeches  in the papers are accessible to anyone. In none of these  speeches or writings is there any basis for the claims that I  was announcing any sort of scenarios of events and liquidations  and favored the use of all means to defeat a political opponent.  Such interpretation of my words means perversion and deliberate  imputation of what I have explicitly rejected. Quite the  opposite is the truth. I demand that the politicians act as a  cohesive factor, seek consensus of as many as possible segments  of the society, and create the conditions for a peaceful and  creative life of the people. I am opposed to politicians  currently deepening the existing divisions or causing new  divisions among the people. I am convinced that this is  disastrous for the survival and the future of the Slovene nation.    Esteemed deputies! I have handed you an exact transcript  of what I said in Nova Gorica. From it you will easily conclude  that the message of my speech consisted of three essential  parts. In the first part I, as the president of the state,  again explained my political project. I strive for parallel  coexistence of various beliefs, pluralism, and reconciliation.  I understand reconciliation as an inevitable coexistence of  various convictions about the truth, as a resistance against the  repression of only one truth in the name of which it would be  allowed to attack all other truths and liquidate their  champions. Here I am also referring to the tragic experiences  from World War II and the period directly after it.    In the second part I expressed my regret because the Slovene  political scene has became so pronouncedly divided while  confrontation and uncooperativeness have become the basic  principles of the life on it. Unfortunately, in my opinion, the  principle that he who is not with us is against us is winning a  right of domicile on this scene. This logic transforms an  opponent into an enemy and permits all means to defeat the  enemy, even those that are absolutely contrary to the  fundamental principles of democracy, therefore,  disqualifications and liquidations, if necessary even physical.  This is the merciless logic of this principle and it should be  borne in mind. I, therefore, spoke of a political method that  is striving to assert itself in Slovenia. I opposed it, and I  warned where this method could lead. [passage omitted]    I would like to stress particularly that for almost a year I  have been warning about the damaging processes that have cut  deeply into the working environments, communities, and even  families and have already had their fateful effect on the nation  as a whole, dividing it. I believe that you can see this for  yourselves. This is no longer about identification with one  political leader and rejection of other political leaders, this  is about undermining of credibility and trust in the legitimate  institutions of the system, including the parliament, the  government, and the legislation. Therefore, I did not announce  any individual events but merely warned about the political  circumstances that could lead toward incidents and political  instability.    The State Chamber does not ask me directly about my alleged  involvement in the Smolnikar affair. However, this question has  been raised in public constantly by forces who would, in my  opinion, like to shed their responsibility for it. With full  responsibility I assure you that I am not connected with this  affair nor are the people from my cabinet. This also applies to  all other unlawful actions. For this reason I am furthermore  interested in an expert and quick investigation. It would be  most unusual if the fact that this constituted the biggest  violation of human rights would finally become completely  irrelevant.    In the third part I advocated that the standards of  expertise  and excellence should apply to professional performance of  duties connected with the running of the state. In place of  efforts to give prominence to a positive, that is to say, expert  selection of cadres in the life of our state, we are constantly  witnessing the attempts of self-praise and self-justification  with the references to the so-called old structures,  conspiracies, powerful secret organizations, icebergs, and so  forth. It is primarily those who are incapable of forming a  positive program of social changes themselves that talk about  this, even though such positive changes are badly needed and the  citizens demand them with full justification. [passage omitted]    Esteemed deputies! From the media and the events in Slovene  society you and I could both learn about and ponder over the  events of which I spoke in Nova Gorica, which testify of the  violation of the principles of a law-governed and a democratic  state. I spoke of a group calling itself the Civilian  Initiative and its anonymous circulars, of constant threats with  dossiers, of old and new mafias, and of illegal groups that  function as para-intelligence services, illegally gathering  information and tailing state and political officials,  journalists, and public persons. Let me remind you that I  warned last summer that our state was not sufficiently protected  in the area of counterintelligence and that it would be sensible  to form the National Security Council within the government,  which would steer, coordinate, and supervise the work of our  intelligence services in the parliament. The prime minister's  political collegium also partially concluded so when it decided  in March that as a matter of rule the prime minister will  establish the necessary coordination between the departments,  that is to say, services through the political collegium. I  remain firmly convinced that we must immediately set up all  legal and institutional bases and frameworks that would  facilitate effective functioning of the supervisory mechanisms  over the repressive apparatus of the state as a whole. It must  be shielded from the temptation to accomplish goals and tasks  with prohibited means. We must prevent that individuals or  groups would misuse it for political purposes or even to morally  disqualify political adversaries and different-minded people in  general. [passage omitted]    I expect that the sensitivity of the public and the state  offices toward any sort of arbitrary violation of human rights  will increase. Namely, if we do not resist immediately any  cases of unlawful bugging and surveillance of the post today,  this will happen to somebody else tomorrow, and to all of us the  day after. You know what Murphy's law says: If you are a  paranoiac it does not necessary mean that you are not being  followed. There will always be plenty of the so-called higher  interests with which to justify such behavior. For this reason  I believe that the prime minister's resoluteness in not  tolerating any unlawful activities regardless of their  perpetrators deserves the full support of the parliament and the  public. I expect that everybody will act in this way.    Esteemed deputies! The State Chamber holds a report by the  Slovene Government about the problems in cooperation between the  Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Defense Ministry, and the  conclusions of the March political collegium with the prime  minister. I did not have this information until the end of last  week when I again explicitly requested it. I have based my  assessments on official verbal explanations of the incumbent  officials of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and their findings  in the investigation about the Civilian Initiative, which I had  proposed myself. I also based my assessments on other publicly  recorded events and also numerous opinions and warnings put  forward in the parliamentary debates. It would be irresponsible  of me to be unconcerned by these occurrences and to remain  indifferent. I expected an appropriate reaction from the  incumbent state offices and the State Chamber commissions here.  At the same time this was also a reason to invite the prime  minister and the State Chamber chairman to discuss the political  and security situation in the country and my public assessments  of these circumstances. I believe that the cases of unlawful  activity should be pointed out immediately, before they become  daily practice. It is much easier to form an assessment about  the security situation in the country on the basis of the  government report, especially regarding the observation of  constitutionality, legality, and protection of human rights.    I expect that the government will inform you of all the  findings that it has uncovered or will uncover in the  investigation of all events that have justifiably caused concern  among the public for quite some time. This also applies to the  arms with which Slovenia, also in the interest of its own  security, helped Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, as well as the  arms intended for the Slovene Army. The State Chamber and the  public must get a thorough report about all this to clear all  rumors about irregularities or even personal acquisitions and  possible war profiteering. If this has happened, then the  culprits must answer for it before a court of law.    I stick to my constitutional authorities. I do not interfere  with the official procedures and actions of the state services,  ministries, government, or the parliament except in the cases  and in the spheres explicitly determined by the Constitution and  the law. A duty to protect the constitutional order has  compelled me to send numerous written warnings and proposals to  the Slovene government. To illustrate, let me quote some of the  issues to which the warnings referred and which, in my judgment,  constituted a breach of the law and arbitrariness on the part of  the state offices and their officials. In my opinion on the  proposal of the Defense Law, which I sent to you at the request  of the State Chamber on 3 December 1993, I pointed out the  controversial nature both of the government decree on ranks and  promotion in the Defense Ministry, as of the government's  agreeing to the proposal for the dismissal of the commander of  the Republican Headquarters of the Territorial Defense and the  appointment of a new commander, the questionable awarding of  honors and medals in the Defense Ministry, the intolerable  interference of military personnel in the political sphere,  failure to inform the president of the republic as the supreme  commander about the actual situation in the defense forces and  their combat-readiness, at the need to form a National Security  Council of the government to steer, coordinate, and supervise  the work of the entire security-intelligence and  counterintelligence activity of the state and to safeguard the  State Chamber's supervision over this activity and the entire  defense sphere. I warned of the unlawful and arbitrary  deployment of the guard of honor of the Territorial Defense and  the unlawful usurping of the authority to discharge soldiers,  where the minister even quoted consultations with the  Constitutional Court. The essence of my warnings was that until  the new laws are passed we must observe the prevailing ones and  at the same time hurry up with the preparation and adoption of  an overall, new Defense Law that will be harmonized with the  Constitution. [passage omitted]    One should not overlook the fact that the government is  responsible for the implementation of laws, for the management  and direction of the state administration through ministers, and  for the supervision of their work.    Regarding the anonymous writing of the so-called Civilian  Initiative and its links with the foreign intelligence services,  as it professes itself, regarding the supposed bugging in the  Bank of Slovenia, and regarding the discovery of the arms on  Maribor airport, I have urged, in writing and in personal  contacts with the prime minister, the interior minister, and the  chief of the Slovene Intelligence Security Agency, that matters  be investigated thoroughly, that the interests of the state be  protected, the safety of citizens safeguarded, and the domestic  and international public informed about the conclusions. Let me  here state also my opinion about the way in which the president  of the republic is being informed -- not Milan Kucan, but the  institution of the president of this country. Because of his  constitutional duties, obligations in country's political life,  and appearances on the international scene, it is definitely in  the interest of all citizens and all institutions that shape and  implement country's internal and external policy that the  president of the state be promptly and thoroughly informed about  all affairs that are important for the effective functioning of  the state. My everyday experiences convince me that the present  manner in which the president is informed does not perform up to  this standard. I believe that in finalizing our legislation and  its harmonization with the Constitution, it would pay to  consider a suitable legal solution for these relations. The  lack of a defined means of informing the president of the  republic, who is elected directly, is a poor testimony for this  country, the government, and the State Chamber. It is odd, to  say the least, to wonder where the president of the state gets  his information from, and not why the president of the state is  not informed. Countries with parliamentary tradition have these  relations defined by law. [passage omitted]    Esteemed deputies! Despite all the unquestioned and  encouraging achievements and successes of the last two and a  half, that is, almost three years of Slovenia's independent  life, I still believe that the basic premises and goals of the  plebiscite are as topical as they were at the time of their  adoption. I believe and hope that this project will remain a  common concern of the parliamentary and all other parties, all  state offices and the institutions of the civic society, just as  its demanding the first step -- the gaining of Slovenia's  independence -- was a common concern. [passage omitted]    As in all countries, especially those that have broken off  with their real socialist past, there are social anomalies here,  too, that hurt the citizens in a material, political, and moral  way and for which there is often no excuse. Here I refer to the  state's being too expensive, the slow pace of property  transformation and the accompanying abuses as well as the abuses  pointed out in the debate about public debt that affect the  workers who, having invested their efforts and labor in the  companies for decades, are many of them now unemployed and  concerned for their job, salaries, and survival. Also, I refer  to the cases of corruption, inexplicable foot-dragging over  denationalization, and the uncompensated injustices against  those hurt by the old political regime, even perfectly simple  ones, such as compensation for the time spent in prison, for  suffering, the right to have a grave and be remembered, and so  forth, which is all a matter of legislation and thus also a  matter of this parliament.    I am also convinced that the regulation of relations between  the state and the church is also not running as one would wish  and as well as possible. The criticisms of the slow systematic  replacement of old laws and their harmonization with the legal  standards of the European Union and the Council of Europe, and  the ability of the social institutions, especially the judiciary  and the prosecutors' offices, to prevent breaches of the law  more efficiently and promptly than so far, are justified. I  have warned about this in my public appearances. It is my  judgment that I must do so on this occasion in the State  Chamber, which is a legislative organ. I again stress the need  to resolve these questions faster because their remaining  unresolved only exacerbates the often justified protests of  dissatisfied citizens who will eventually try to achieve justice  by themselves. I am convinced of this also by a great number of  letters that I receive daily. The people's potential for  protest and justified grief and hard feelings should not be an  object of political misuse. A timely detection of the potential  protest demands quick, timely, and convincing responses. For  this reason I again urge the observation of the principles of a  law-governed state, legality, and constitutionality, which are  the bases of democracy, the safety of citizens, the basis of  respect for their dignity and the protection of their rights. I  also urge effective action against social anomalies and moral  injury. [passage omitted]</p>

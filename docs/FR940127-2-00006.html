			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Petitioner's FMV consisted of the sum of materials, labor, energy, utilities, overhead, general expenses, profit, and packing. In accordance with the hierarchy preferred for valuing factors (set forth in the notice of Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Certain Carbon Steel Butt-Weld Pipe Fittings From the People's Republic of China, 57 FR 21058 (May 18, 1992) (Comment 4)), petitioner relied where possible on publicly available information. Where such information was unavailable, petitioner relied on its own cost or experience.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to section 773(c)(1) of the Act, petitioner added to the labor and material costs the statutory minima of 10 percent for general expenses and eight percent for profit, as well as an amount for packing based on import statistics from India.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Fair Value Comparisons  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based on the data provided by the petitioner, there is reason to believe that the merchandise is being, or is likely to be, sold at less than fair value. Based on our analysis of information submitted in the petition amendment, we found it necessary to conduct further research regarding the pricing of certain factors of production upon which FMV was based. Subsequent to that research, petitioners submitted amendments to the petition including additional price information. The comparison of USP and FMV in the petition, as amended, indicates margins of 33.59% to 444.37%. If it becomes necessary at a later date to consider the petition as a source of best information available (BIA), we may review all of the bases for USP and FMV in determining BIA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Initiation of Investigation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We have examined the petition on coumarin and have found that it meets the requirements of section 732(b) of the Act. Therefore, we are initiating an antidumping duty investigation to determine whether imports of coumarin from the PRC are being, or are likely to be, sold in the United States at less than fair value.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> ITC Notification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 732(d) of the Act requires us to notify the International Trade Commission (ITC) of this action, and we have done so.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Preliminary Determination by the ITC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The ITC will determine by February 14, 1994, whether there is a reasonable indication that imports of coumarin from the PRC are materially injuring, or threaten material injury to, a U.S. industry. Any ITC determination which is negative will result in this investigation being terminated; otherwise, this investigation will proceed according to statutory and regulatory time limits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This notice is published pursuant to section 732(c)(2) of the Act and 19 CFR 353.13(b).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: January 19, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Joseph A.

			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / Pensions body calls for more time on shortfalls The National Association of Pension Funds has urged the government to allow employers more time to make up shortfalls in pension schemes when tougher funding rules take effect. The government proposed in a white paper a minimum solvency standard which would require pension schemes to hold enough assets to pay the 'cash equivalent' value of each member's benefits if the scheme were wound up immediately. It proposed that schemes with assets of 90 per cent or more of the standard should have up to three years to make up the shortfall but those below that should make up the shortfall within three months. The association wants the government to allow the schemes meeting 90 per cent or more of the standard to have up to 10 years, and those below 90 per cent up to three years. The association said it 'believes that such cash injections would be extremely disruptive and unnecessary for financially sound employers'. The purpose of the new standard is to ensure that members of pension schemes receive all promised benefits if the scheme is wound up. In many cases an employer is insolvent following wind-up and scheme members cannot receive their entitlements. Critics who oppose giving employers more time to make up a deficit point out that too frequently it is employers in financial difficulty that do not have the resources to fill the shortfall. By the time the longer grace period is over, the shortfall may be even larger and the employer may have already gone into receivership, they warn. The association is urging the government to try to improve pension security by setting a long-term funding standard. This is a reversal of the association's initial position which had urged the Goode committee, advising the government on occupational pension reform, to seek a minimum solvency standard.</p>

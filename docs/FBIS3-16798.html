The subject of the reorganization of the city's executive  branch was one of the main subjects in a conversation between  the mayor and journalists. Sobchak reported the upcoming  considerable reduction in the army of city hall officials which,  according to him, was dictated by the low work efficiency of a  number of committees, the duplication of their functions, and  excessive red tape in solving what are sometimes the most  elementary questions. The financial and economic committees will  merge, the size of the committee for the administration of city  property will be considerably reduced, and the total number of  officials threatened with dismissal will reach 340.    The mayor believes that existing privatization legislation  facilitates corruption and the transfer of considerable material  assets into the hands of mafia-type operators. This is why,  Sobchak said, he will make every effort to delay the process of  floating enterprises in Petersburg until parliament adopts  civilized laws.    Forecasting the composition of the future city assembly, the  mayor stressed that he is alarmed by the nomination for deputy  of people guilty of sharp practice, forgery, bribery, and other  criminal activity and who are now under investigation.  Petersburgers, he said, must show their characteristic common  sense and vigilance when they put their voting papers into the  ballot box.    Answering a question about the possibility that Arkadiy  Kramarev, chief of the Petersburg and Oblast Internal Affairs  Main Administration, will be removed from his post, Sobchak  confirmed that these rumors are groundless. Although it is not  for him but the Ministry of Internal Affairs to assess the  general's activity, the mayor holds the Internal Affairs Main  Administration leadership directly responsible for the extremely  unfavorable crime situation in the city.    The journalists were among the first to learn first-hand  from  the mayor that the European Bank for Reconstruction and  Development has agreed to invest in the construction of a new  airport on the banks of the Neva whose cost is estimated at $75  million. This bank intends to make a considerable investment in  the reconstruction of St. Petersburg's historic center.    One of the main events in Petersburg's life in the near  future will be an international banking congress, which will be  unprecedented in the country's entire history in terms of the  composition and number of participants. It will bring together  around 4,000 bankers and dozens of the biggest Russian and world  banks on the banks of the Neva and will last 10 days.    But the main event of the coming summer will undoubtedly be  the Goodwill Games. The reconstruction of sports facilities,  the mayor assured, is being carried out according to schedule  and will be completed on time. As of today 2,000 of the world's  leading sportsmen have sent in their applications to participate  in the Goodwill Games-94.</p>

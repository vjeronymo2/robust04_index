When the two journalists, who were on assignment to cover  the  demolition exercise in Mushin on the outskirts of Lagos, were  shown on the television, they could hardly walk. One of them  was almost naked as his clothes were torn following the beating.    The security agents were members of a environmental  sanitation special task force set up by the Lagos state  government to demolish about 300 shops and buildings in Mushin  which had made it impossible to construct a government hospital.    The demolition exercise started Tuesday following the expiry  of a one-week ultimatum given to the owners of the buildings by  state military administrator Colonel Olagunsoye Oyinlola to  vacate the area or face demolition of the structures.    THE GUARDIAN newspaper protested against the maltreatment of  the journalists amd the government sent officials to apologise,  the newspaper reported Wednesday here.</p>

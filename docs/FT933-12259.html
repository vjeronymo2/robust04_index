			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Arts: Kirov's tarnished treasure THE GREATEST treasure in the Kirov Ballet's repertory is The Sleeping Beauty. This ultimate exposition of the grandeur and noble aspirations of academic dancing was made at the Mariinsky Theatre for the troupe whose direct descendants we see today. Across war and revolution and social change, through siege and the dissolution of a political system, the miracles of Tchaikovsky's score and Petipa's choreography have been preserved in a dance style as serene in proportion, as civilised in humanity, as the great city which gave them birth. To sit in the Mariinsky Theatre and watch Beauty, is to sense something of the moral implications ('Dance is a moral question,' said Balanchine, product of this theatre's - and of Beauty's - traditions) as well as the physical harmonies the ballet celebrates. The Kirov has toured Beauty since its first venture to the West with the Covent Garden season of 1961. Then Beauty looked sublime, in ensemble as in the performances of such glorious artists as Kolpakova, Sizova, Zubkovskaya, Sokolov, Solovyov. Whatever the vicissitudes of the company's history thereafter, I have felt that Beauty was the touchstone of its qualities, the vital point of reference for the troupe's well-being. Touring imposes constraints upon effects and, maybe, casting. But in Thursday's performance that brought the piece into the Coliseum repertory, I noted erosions of manner, accommodations of effect, which minimised the piece, and the company's golden reputation. The staging looked cramped - which it did not at Covent Garden - and somewhat cursory. Was it necessary to reduce the Hunting scene - whose autumnal grace the Kirov alone knows how to show - into a bad joke about arrows thrown at a target, with the loss of the court dances and the charming Farandole for the peasants? (The inclusion of the second act entr'acte was justified because we had the Mariinsky orchestra playing magnificently, with a fine but unnamed violinist - worthy heir to Leopold Auer for whom this music was first written.). The general run of mime performance, and the supernumeraries who dress the stage, seemed numb with tedium. The Virsaladze designs - more truncated than heretofore - are still beautiful, even if the last act shows us a distant prospect of the casino at Beaulieu rather than Versailles. But the costuming needs attention: wigs are increasingly improbable except as examples of what a bright girl can do with cotton wool; some of the court outfits, still worn with flair, are risible. The production, in sum, is an unworthy frame for the company's classic style - exquisite in poise and lightness; the shape of movement ideal in balance and generosity. The work of the corps de ballet exemplifies these virtues quite as much as the dancing of the soloists. We watch, and marvel. Academism becomes highest art. In Thursday's performance by Larissa Lezhnina as Aurora, the dance was true and lovely. Hers is an interpretation which combines easiest grace with something gentle. Never badgering her audience with technique, Lezhnina dances with a dulcet mastery that is irresistible. Line is pure; the character is youthful; there is something happily engaging in every moment; here, indeed, is a young princess, with all that implies of aristocratic means and femininity. There are moments when Lezhnina shows she can command formidable resources of skill, but everything is dedicated to Petipa's steps in their purest form. It is an exemplary reading. Her Prince was Farukh Ruzimatov. The Kirov has taught us how this role may be grandly danced. Interpretations by Semenyov, by Sokolov (a marvel of elegance and technical distinction: on his first London appearance he had to repeat the coda of his variation), and by the angelic Solovyov, were as near-perfect as makes no difference. Ruzimatov took to the stage in what looked a sulky impersonation of Nureyev (another great Kirov Prince). Given his tangled Medusa-locks and his sniffy expression, Aurora might be forgiven for thinking she had been awakened by Carabosse. Nor did Ruzimatov's dancing make much of a case for his princely status. I thought it an unlikely reading. The dancing of the Fairy soloists and of the corps de ballet was - in spite of a sense of cramped conditions - distinguished. I record, for fellow-admirers of Good King Herod, that there was an outburst of smirking tots in the first act waltz, all of whom should have been in bed hours before. In fairness, though, I note that on home territory the Kirov's child cohorts are quite clearly human, and beautifully trained. The Kirov Ballet is at the Coliseum, London, until July 31. Programming varies.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] On the same day that the DIARIO OFICIAL carried  authorization for a 12-member Brazilian delegation to travel to  Lisbon, the meeting of the chiefs of state and government of  Portuguese-speaking countries, which should have taken place in  Lisbon tomorrow, was canceled.    Portuguese President Mario Soares yesterday telephoned  President Itamar Franco to inform him that the presidents of  Cape Verde and Angola would also not attend the meeting, and  would send representatives instead. In view of this Mario  Soares decided to cancel the meeting and postpone it to another  date. The chief of the Brazilian delegation would have been  former President Jose Sarney, and four ministers were to travel  with him.    Brazilian Ambassador to Portugal Jose Aparecido de Oliveira  did not like this cancellation, as he was one of the greatest  enthusiasts of the meeting and of the principal point on its  agenda: the unification of the Portuguese language.    Up until the very last moment Jose Aparecido tried to make  President Itamar Franco change his mind and attend the meeting.  When he did not convince him, Jose Aparecido became furious.</p>

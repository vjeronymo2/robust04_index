			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / Finance and the Family: For income, growth and tax planning, too - Debbie Harrison examines insurance bonds Those seeking the best way to invest a lump sum to provide capital growth, a regular income or a combination of both may - in addition to a host of unit trusts - come across a confusing range of insurance bonds which claim to meet these requirements and, at the same time, offer chances for tax planning. Insurance bonds, sold by life offices, are one-off or 'single premium' investments. In most cases, they have no fixed maturity date. The range of funds is similar to unit trusts although there are special low-risk insurance bond options that appeal to the ultra-cautious investor. But the tax treatment of insurance bonds and unit trusts is different. The element of life cover offered by insurance bonds, although nominal, allows them to qualify for standard life assurance tax treatment. This means that the fund, not the individual, pays tax that is equivalent broadly to the basic rate on both income and capital gains. With unit trusts, the dividends distributed are deemed net of lower-rate income tax but the fund rolls up free of capital gains tax (CGT), which is paid by the investor when units are cashed in. This gives unit trusts two advantages over insurance bonds. First, the investor can use his annual CGT allowance to offset this tax. Second, non-taxpayers can reclaim all or most of the income tax (depending on the fund) which is deducted from the dividends. The same is true for investment trusts. Under an insurance bond, these taxes cannot be offset or reclaimed, which means that non-taxpayers generally should not invest in bonds. Taxpayers should consider the CGT implications very carefully before opting for a bond rather than a unit or investment trust. The main distinguishing feature of bonds is that the investor can withdraw 5 per cent of the original capital for 20 years without having to include this 'income' in the tax return. This is because the Inland Revenue regards these withdrawals as a return of the original capital investment. The 5 per cent annual withdrawal can be carried over fully or partially to future years. For lower-rate taxpayers, there is no further liability, but higher-rate taxpayers will be liable to tax when the bond is cashed in. But they can claim 'top-slicing' relief on any profit they have made. This works by averaging the profit over the number of years the bond has been in place and adding the result to the investor's income, so arriving at any higher-rate tax due. You can make withdrawals larger than 5 per cent. These are treated as net of basic-rate income tax, so there is no further charge for basic-rate taxpayers. But those paying higher-rate tax will incur a 15 per cent liability (the difference between the basic and higher rates). This flexibility over the amount of income withdrawn is considered one of the most important features of insurance bonds. Advisers usually recommend that the policy is written on a joint life basis so that, if the policyholder dies, the bond can continue in the spouse's name. You can also write the policy in a simple family trust so that, on death, the fund passes on in a tax-efficient way to the next generation. Charges on unit-linked bonds are similar to unit trusts with a 5 per cent initial charge (the bid/offer spread) and an annual management charge of between 0.75 per cent and 1.25 per cent depending on the fund. Fee-based advisers will be able to reduce or eliminate the initial charge. If you are interested in a bond, your adviser should consider the tax consequences and your attitude to risk before selecting the most appropriate product (see 'choice' below). With a large number of funds available for most types of bond, independent advice is essential. Good, consistent performance is paramount, but the adviser should also check the provider's charges and financial strength. This is particularly important in the case of with-profits funds, which must have substantial reserves.</p>

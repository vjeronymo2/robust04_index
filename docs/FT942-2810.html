			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / Observer: Brazilian bingo The normally friendly rivalry between Brazil's two largest cities - Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro - took an ugly turn at the weekend. Sao Paulo snobbishly looks down on its poorer, but better-known cousin, Rio de Janeiro, and Sao Paulo's media especially revels in Rio's reputation for terrifying violence. But at the weekend 42 people were murdered in separate incidents in Sao Paulo; 21 were killed in execution-style assassinations believed to be linked to drug-dealing. By Wednesday morning, however, Rio had recovered its reputation as the country's most violent city - in a 24-hour period, 22 people were shot.</p>

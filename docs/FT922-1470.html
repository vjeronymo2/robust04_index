			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Survey on A-Z of Computing (15): Users look for reliable connections - Networks Judith Massey NETWORKS ARE the logical extensions to computers. As soon as users begin to build up digital information on their own systems, they need to look for a way to share it with colleagues - as well as a way to gather more information from other sources. Today the use of networks is being driven faster than ever before. Now the low cost of hardware makes the idea of a personal computer on every desk a reality, organisations need a data communications infrastructure to speed the flow of information around their company. New applications based on the distributed client/server model are also fuelling demand, because they rely heavily on the use of fast, resilient networks that link desktop to server. Demand for networks is measured by research companies in different ways. Surveys of the market measure the number of network connection cards being installed, or how many network servers are being bought. Researchers also count the number of organisations installing network operating systems. The operating system is used to manage and direct the flow of data and files around the network, which runs over a basic cabling infrastructure. PCs are connected to the network via network connection cards, and network servers are used to store applications and data. Whichever way you look at it, the use of networks is growing fast. International Data Corporation (IDC) reports that of 60m to 70m PCs worldwide, 25m are already connected to a network. Market Intelligence Research (MIRC) says that European sales of PC local area network (Lan) operating systems will double in 1992. In 1991, this market was worth Dollars 1.1bn, in 1992 it will be worth Dollars 2.2bn, says MIRC. Turning to large European organisations, recent research from Dataquest finds that over 50 per cent of PCs are now connected to Lans. These companies often install Lans to replace other computing hardware platforms. More often than not, companies install Lans to replace stand-alone PC systems. Lans are also installed to replace traditional PC to mainframe links, or proprietary multi-user hardware. The main reason to install Lans instead of proprietary mid-range hardware is related to price and performance. The cost and proliferation of PC hardware and of UNIX-based network servers has fallen fast during the past five years. The Lan platform can embrace existing PCs, and it can be expanded easily when new users join the network. The choice between mid-range and Lan platform is not the only one. Large organisations also need to decide which network operating system and which cabling type to use. But many of the choices have now disappeared because network vendors have the ultimate goal of connecting every desktop computer to every back office server computer - it is no longer in their interests to lock users into one particular way of communicating. The two main vendors of network operating systems in the 1990s are Novell and Microsoft, with Banyan, IBM, Digital Equipment (Dec), Hewlett-Packard and others following behind. For the moment Novell is the industry leader, with a 60-70 per cent share of the world Lan market. Microsoft recently lost several exclusive deals with key vendors such as 3Com, H-P and IBM, but is marketing Lan Manager more vigorously today than it did in the 1980s. It is likely that Lan Manager will also be a key component of Microsoft's imminent new operating system, Windows NT. In spite of the popularity of Lans, observers still believe that more widespread use of Lans for corporate systems is held back by the lack of real network applications. Only a handful of applications, such as Lotus Notes and Oracle Server, exploit the speed and flexibility of Lans as vehicles for client/server applications. During the 1980s, Lans spread through organisations almost unchecked. This has created a crisis of complexity for some companies, who find it difficult to manage network traffic, demand for extra capacity, network security and software distribution. These problems arise because PCs and Lans often grow outside the aegis of a central information systems department. It is not surprising that many organisations are looking for better management tools from network vendors, or that server manufacturers, network operating system developers and network bridge suppliers will all announce better, more resilient and more secure network components in the early 1990s. As global markets emerge, there is a growing need for more reliable wide area networks (Wans). It is likely that user demand will drive the development of more cost-effective Wan links outside the traditional public telephone and leased line options. These will include wireless and satellite links, as well as a smarter use of existing telephone networks.</p>

			<p><P> February 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEAT LOAF;  </P> <P> MEAT LOAVES HAVE GONE MODERN WITH REDUCED FAT AND CALORIES WHILE RETAINING  OLD-FASHIONED FLAVOR.  </P> <P> Whoever would have thought that meat loaf, that ubiquitous budget-watcher's  catch-all for leftovers, would make a list of trendy foods at any time? Yet,  that's the way it is.  </P> <P> When 72 Market Street, one of L.A.'s better-known restaurants, first put their  meat loaf (definitely not a home for leftovers) on the menu several years ago,  they really started something. Oddly enough, although one might expect such a  simple, homey food to go out of style after a brief fling as a star in the  fad-filled world of Los Angeles' restaurants, meat loaf has retained a solid  hold on its place in both restaurant and home menus.  </P> <P> Exactly why is certainly a good question. Maybe having trendy restaurants give  approbation to such a plebeian dish has given a lot of closet meat-loaf lovers  the assurance they needed to admit that they like it. Or perhaps it's because  meat loaf is a familiar food in this country of meat-and-potato eaters. Or it  could be simply that it's easy to make a good meat loaf.  </P> <P> Meat loaves today only partially resemble the old-fashioned loaf that grandma  used to make. She used inexpensive, high-fat ground beef, onions, whole eggs  and bread crumbs as the base for her meat loaf, adding bits and pieces of  leftover vegetables for flavor.  </P> <P> Modern cooks, intent on lowering the fats and cholesterol (to say nothing of  calories) in their diets, as a rule make these meat mixtures of ground turkey  or very lean ground beef or pork. Egg whites frequently are substituted for  whole eggs and, often, oats are substituted for the bread crumbs to increase  fiber content. All of these simple but effective culinary tricks -- designed to  reduce the fat content of meat loaf yet leave the flavor intact -- can be  adapted to almost any meat loaf recipe.  </P> <P> One of the nicest things about making a meat loaf is that it's difficult to  ruin one, provided you use good ingredients to begin with. As with any food  that is based on a combination of ingredients blended together, it is advisable  to do the mixing with a light hand. And to my mind, meat loaf is truly a "hands  on" mixture. Using a fork or spoon to combine the amount of ground meat needed  with all of the other ingredients with is a frustrating experience. I, for one,  much prefer to plunge into the mixing bowl with my impeccably clean hands and  lightly, but thoroughly, blend the raw ingredients together with my fingers  before gently patting them into loaf form. It may not be a neat procedure, but  it is remarkably soul-satisfying -- and it works.  </P> <P> Some of the meat loaf recipes that appear here are designed for entertaining.  The pinwheel meat loaf mixture filled with mixed vegetables, for instance,  makes a wonderful buffet offering for a crowd. And the Italian Meat Loaves,  which resemble country terrines, can be served as appetizers for a small dinner  party. Or they can simply be a hot main dish for a cozy twosome.  </P> <P> Serious cholesterol watchers will find the turkey meat loaf a tasty, worthwhile  dish, while those addicted to Mexican flavorings will like the Mexican meat  loaf.  </P> <P> Most of today's recipes will serve six to eight hungry souls. That's because  meat loaf is not something that works really well when prepared in a small  quantity. If you have a small family or are single, to obtain optimum flavor  it's better to blend a relatively large amount of meat and other ingredients  together, and then divide the mixture into meal-size portions before cooking.  Cook and freeze the extra portions for future meals and relax in the knowledge  that you have several good meals stashed in the freezer for those nights when  there's no time to cook or you simply aren't in the mood.  </P> <P> </P> <P> STUFFED TURKEY LOAVES  </P> <P> 2 1/2 pounds ground turkey  </P> <P> 1 large onion, finely chopped  </P> <P> 1 medium green pepper, finely chopped  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon Chinese 5-spice powder  </P> <P> 3 slices bread  </P> <P> 4 egg whites  </P> <P> 1/4 cup dry Sherry  </P> <P> Salt, pepper  </P> <P> 1 (11-ounce) jar cranberry-orange-relish  </P> <P> Combine turkey, onion, green pepper and 5-spice powder in large mixing bowl.

Season to taste with salt and pepper.  </P> <P> Divide mixture into 8 portions and pat 1 portion each into bottom of 4 (2-cup)  lightly greased baking dishes. Top each with 1/4 of cranberry-orange relish.  Top relish with remaining turkey portions and press to seal around edges.  </P> <P> Place baking dishes in pan filled with enough water to come half way up sides  of cups.

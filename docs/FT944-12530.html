			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Rise and fall of a colourful empire Mr Gerald Ronson built up the Heron empire from the 1960s, first through a move into petrol retailing and then into the UK property market in the 1970s. A colourful character, he was renowned for his charitable causes. He moved into the US property and financial services businesses a decade later and it was the decline in that market in the late 1980s which started Heron's problems, writes Christopher Price. Heron moved into the booming American thrift business - the equivalent of British building societies - by buying Pima in the early 1980s. By 1984 Pima was claimed to be the fastest-growing financial institution in its home state of Arizona. But from being potentially one of the group's biggest earners, Pima became a huge drag on its finances. By 1989 the thrift industry had over-extended and collapsed as ambitious borrowers got into difficulties. Pima began to cost Heron some Pounds 40m a year: it was the business to which Guinness paid much of the Pounds 5.8m for Heron's support in the Distillers bid. Heron returned the money. As debts mounted, Mr Ronson was forced to sell assets, a protracted affair given the size and variety of his empire. The disposals included petrol stations, video distribution, leisure interests and car distribution. This culminated with the sale of the Heron Motor Group for Pounds 16m, leaving just the property company.</p>

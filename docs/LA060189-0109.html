			<p><P> June 1, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Local Swedish politicians in the Stockholm suburb of Kista, apparently reacting  to public uproar, dropped plans to send a group of eight teen-age offenders on  a six-month rehabilitation cruise to the Caribbean at taxpayer expense. The  teen-agers, convicted of crimes such as assault, theft and burglary, were  candidates for the $80,000 cruise. At least three social workers would have  accompanied them. None of the eight are serving prison sentences, although they  must report regularly to the authorities. Their behavior was deemed so bad that  no halfway house would accept them.  </P></p>

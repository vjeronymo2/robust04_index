			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, March 17 (AFP) -- The Bosnian Government  and Bosnian Serbs on Thursday signed an agreement to open roads  and partially lift the siege of the Bosnian capital Sarajevo, a  UN special envoy announced.    Under the UN-sponsored agreement, Sarajevo will be linked by  road to central Bosnia-Herzegovina via the Moslem majority town  of Visoko (25 kilometres, or 15 miles) to the west, UN special  envoy Sergio Vieria de Mello stated.    Other road corridors will be opened to link Sarajevo's  Serb-held suburbs of Ilidza and Lukavica, on the one hand, and  the Moslem suburbs of Butmir and Dobrinja on the other.    A bridge between the Serb-held Grbavica district in downtown  Sarajevo and the rest of the capital will also be opened under  the accord signed at Sarajevo airport.    The agreement, whose signing was twice postponed will take  effect from Tuesday and concerns the resumption of civilian  traffic for humanitarian and business purposes.    The text was signed in Vieira de Mello's presence by Hasan  Muratovic, the Bosnian minister responsible for relations with  the United Nations, and the main Bosnian Serb negotiator Momcilo  Krajisnik.    When it takes effect, Sarajevo will be connected with the  outside world, though only partially, for the first time in  almost two years of siege by the Bosnian Serbs.    The UN Protection Forces (UNPROFOR) is responsible for  organising and monitoring implementation of the accord.    Civilians wishing to use the reopened roads will be able to  do so, by bus, to the extent of one return trip per day, after  notifying UNPROFOR personnel 24 hours in advance.    The UN force would then notify competent authorities  representing the warring parties of the lists of passengers.</p>

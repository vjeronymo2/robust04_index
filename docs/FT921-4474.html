			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / MoD promises more backing for contractors THE MINISTRY of Defence is promising to release more information to contractors about its purchasing plans and to provide more backing for the early phases of new-technology projects. The initiative by Mr Alan Clark, defence procurement minister, is an effort to head off complaints from the industry about the lack of support and guidance. It coincides with a campaign launched by the Society of British Aerospace Companies for more government support in the face of defence cuts and declining civil business. Manufacturers gave the initiative a cautious welcome, but said they would need to see how it worked in practice. Mr Clark, who is to stand down at the general election, called last September for the views of leading defence companies. That was followed by consultations with individual industrialists, the society and the Defence Manufacturers' Association. The association plans to brief its members on the initiative tomorrow. Leading contractors are to be invited to a private conference with ministers and MoD officials in July. Chaired by Mr Malcolm McIntosh, the ministry's chief of defence procurement, it will be the first such meeting to bring together suppliers of air, sea and land equipment, and is to be repeated annually. Mr Clark said MoD procurement staff had been asked to be 'as forthcoming as possible' about plans. He also announced an extra Pounds 40m this year for 'technology demonstrator programmes' in areas such as electronics, armour, radar and computer software. 'These can offer practical evidence of the feasibility of a technology, reduce risk in subsequent development programmes, and focus resources on those areas of technology likely to offer the best return on investment,' he said. At the same time the MoD is to study the feasibility of developing new systems without immediately proceeding to production. A second study is to be carried out into the implications for defence procurement of integrating design, manufacturing and support engineering in a single process.</p>

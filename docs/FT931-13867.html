			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / A long way to go, but little time: The German government's savings package is a tough response to budget pressures It must be honestly admitted, even in the most loyal circles surrounding Chancellor Helmut Kohl, that his ambitious savings plan to finance the soaring costs of German unification has gone down like a lead balloon. The 50-page 'federal consolidation programme', painfully negotiated by Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister, with his coalition partners and published on Tuesday, spares no one in its distribution of the cuts. It is one of the most comprehensive attempts to reduce both social spending and industrial subsidies to have been made by a post-war German government. The programme, which involves cuts of DM20bn (Pounds 8.20bn) a year by 1995, is intended as the federal government's main contribution to a 'solidarity pact' with the opposition, the 16 lander (state) governments, trade unions and employers, to pay for unification and revive the collapsed east German economy. Yet it has pleased no one, not even the parliamentary parties backing the ruling coalition. A clear majority of west German electors say they are not prepared to give up any of their income to pay for the costs of unification; that is what they are being asked to do. Equally, it is clear that east German leaders do not think that the modest amounts of extra cash being liberated will seriously dent the problems ahead of them. As for the budget disciplinarians, including the German Bundesbank, who have been demanding radical action by the state to reduce its bloated deficits, the package simply does not go far enough. The shock of Tuesday was that, far from keeping the federal government's net borrowing requirement under control in the current year, the plan would actually push it up another DM10bn (Pounds 4.10bn) to DM53bn. The cause is a drop in tax revenues and an increase in unemployment costs resulting from the downturn in the German economy. Coming on the same day as a long-heralded and lacklustre Cabinet reshuffle, the package would appear to demonstrate the widely held view in German political circles that the Kohl administration is adrift without ideas. The reality is inevitably rather more complicated. For a start, perhaps the most positive response to the whole solidarity pact package came yesterday from the least likely source - the mighty IG-Metall engineering workers' union. Mr Franz Steinkuhler, the union leader, has been negotiating quietly with Chancellor Kohl for months. All the indications yesterday were that he was still very much on board to do a deal on the solidarity pact. Officially, the union went out of its way to welcome several of the principal aspects which emerged from the government's proposals, all of which were answers to trade union demands made in the talks. They include the public acceptance that east German enterprises which cannot be sold by the Treuhand privatisation agency, and yet which offer some hope of becoming profitable in the long run, can be preserved as 'federal industrial properties'. That amounts, according to Mr Jorg Barczynski, the union spokesman, to a '180-degree turn in Treuhand policy'. This concession is complemented by an increase in the investment subsidy payable to small-scale east German businesses from the current 8 per cent of planned investment to 20 per cent. The government has also accepted an increase in the oil tax, from January 1 1994, to help finance the debt burden of the German railway system. And finally it has agreed - not explicitly in the document, but according to an assurance by Chancellor Kohl - that the government will not attempt to enforce, through legislation, a renegotiation of wage contracts in east Germany. These contracts offer eastern German workers wage parity with their counterparts in the west by 1994. A significant slowing of that process is demanded by the employers, but Mr Kohl has said that it must be negotiated with the unions and not imposed by the government. As for the other government spending cuts, they are still being weighed up in the union's Frankfurt headquarters. What the package put forward by Mr Kohl and Mr Waigel does demonstrate, nonetheless, is the ever-shrinking room for manoeuvre of the German government between the Scylla and Charybdis of east German structural collapse, and west German economic recession. On the political front that is compounded by the creaking processes of life in a coalition, where every government shake-up has to be dictated by the party balance, and acceptable to all. As the reshuffle demonstrated, it means that the least possible change is the most acceptable solution. Given that reality, the consolidation package looks rather more impressive, and rather more comprehensive in its ambitions than it has yet been given credit for. With a combination of spending cuts and backdoor tax rises, through abolishing a variety of special tax breaks and allowances, Mr Waigel has managed to find savings by 1995 - the first year they all become effective - of some DM20bn. That is the crunch year for the financing of unification. All the accumulated debts, totalling at least DM400bn, including those of the Treuhand and the German unity fund, in which the whole panoply of old East German debt has been collected, will then be transferred to the cost of the central exchequer. Against a financing gap in 1995 currently estimated at DM110bn - DM45bn for the debt servicing, and DM65bn for subsidising the impoverished eastern lander - savings of DM20bn may appear decidedly modest. Mr Waigel has announced his intention to reintroduce the 'solidarity surcharge' on income tax to help bridge the gap. He has also started to slim some sacred cows. He plans to introduce means tests for both children's allowances and the generous subsidy given for new babies; he plans to cut back unemployment benefits, in a bid to keep them below minimum wages; and he is proposing, to the horror of the property-owning classes, a 50 per cent cut in tax relief on mortgages on old houses. He is also launching a new attack on the direct subsidies paid to agriculture, coal-mining and ship-building, all defended by formidable political lobbies. The package thus appears to be a significant step in the direction of one of the principal demands of Mr Tyll Necker, president of the federation of Germany industry, the BDI - that it should create a 'psychology of saving' not just in the public sector, but in the population at large. The savings programme has, however, more precise and immediate aims which may prove more elusive. Most pressing is the intention, spelt out precisely by Mr Waigel in his plan, of persuading the German Bundesbank that it now has the necessary 'room for manoeuvre for interest rate reductions'. Given the immediate DM10bn rise in this year's net borrowing requirement, that is questionable. The central bank was not giving the slightest hint yesterday of its reaction. In Frankfurt banking circles, however, there was a clear feeling that the package so far has not helped the bank to budge. The truth is that the Bundesbank is insisting on seeing clear downwards movement in the underlying trends of both inflation and money supply, before it will relax its principal interest rates. It believes that movement is coming, but it is still not quite visible yet. The combination of a 1 percentage point increase in value-added tax on January 1, and administered price rises in eastern Germany, mean that both January and February are likely to see headline inflation figures of about 4 per cent again - an upwards blip - before the downward trend to 3 per cent resumes. Yet the domestic and international pressure for interest rate cuts is becoming hard to resist. German government and industry fear that the current downturn could persist long after mid-year - the hoped-for turning point - if interest rates stay too high too long. And failure to move German rates down before the French elections in March could cause renewed pressure on the French franc. If a solidarity pact can be agreed before then, it would give the Bundesbank just the credibility fig-leaf it needs to move. That is the immediate gamble Mr Kohl and Mr Waigel have undertaken. In the long term, the figures for paying off the 'burden of the past' in east Germany still look grim. But if they cannot get the German economy moving again before 1994 - election year - then the pain of paying for unification will be stretched well past the end of the century.  -------------------------------------------------------------- Budget deficits (forecasts)  -------------------------------------------------------------- DM bn                             1982   93   94   95   96  -------------------------------------------------------------- Federal government                  40   53   46   56   48 Western Lander                      16   18   15   27   17 Local authorities (west)             7    8    5    8    3 Eastern Lander                      19   23   22    9    9 Local authorities (east)             5    8    9    5    5 Total                               87  110   97  105   82  -------------------------------------------------------------- Source: DIW Institute  --------------------------------------------------------------</p>

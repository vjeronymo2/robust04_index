In any case, this is what he himself claims. In the words  of Zavidiya, he only cooperated with the LDPR (within the scope  of his own political projects) and Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, with  whom the president of the Galand concern had "friendly  relations" for a long time. However, the cooperation between the  concern and the LDPR ended after a dispute that took place  during the election campaign, and Andrey Zavidiya now intends to  engage in political activity independently.    In his words, his acquaintance with Mr. Zhirinovskiy took  place in November 1990. The president of the Galand concern was  attracted by the program of the LDPSS [Liberal-Democratic  Program of the Soviet Union], "which had nothing in common with  his (Zhirinovskiy's) current views." Later, Zavidiya appeared  together with Zhirinovskiy in the presidential elections in 1971.    He insists that in 1993 he did not finance Zhirinovskiy's  party, but his own campaign. In Zavidiya's words, he was  officially placed on the party election rolls, presented to the  Central Electoral Commission, and as a candidate was given an  officially stamped certificate. However, a little later Zavidiya  was crossed off the rolls in violation of all procedural norms.  However, according to Zavidiya's claim, during all of the time  of cooperation "not a single kopek, in the sense of transmitting  money or giving it to someone from the LDPR, was transferred.    Galand concern enterprises paid the telephone bills and  covered expenditures for travel and press products. All told,  according to preliminary estimates, about 3 billion rubles [R]  were spent. Andrey Zavidiya emphasized that all this was done  within the framework of his own election campaign: Galand  structures agitated for the LDPR only because the name of the  president of the concern was on the political roll of the party.  About 50 percent of the party members are my supporters."  However, after the dispute it was impossible to stop the Galand  working machine, and the concern's enterprises continued to  agitate for Zhirinovskiy's party, thinking, probably, that they  were doing this for the good of their own president.    Now Andrey Zavidiya intends to achieve the restoration of  his  rights and really obtain a Duma seat. Moreover, there are plans  for the creation of a large party on the basis of 1,500  enterprises of the Galand concern system, expanded and  reinforced by 3,500 organizational committees. The proposed  party will have to be centrist and "cooperate and be on friendly  terms with both the left and the right."    At present, two examples of Andrey Zavidiya's participation  in party life after the break with the LDPR are known. The  president of the Galand concern is closely associated with the  organizational committee of the Leftist Russia party, which  stands on firm communist positions. In addition, he joined the  organizational committee of the Majority Party (see SEGODNYA No.  100), which, according to the assurances of its leaders, is  closer to the reformers in its positions.</p>

			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / Survey of Iran (8): Competition encouraged - Banking SINCE he became President, Mr Hashemi Rafsanjani's decision to promote a more open economic system and to encourage greater private sector participation in the economy has been extended to the banking system. Iran's banks were nationalised after the 1979 revolution when restructuring took place with a number of bank mergers. Bank Mellat (the Nation's Bank), for example, was the result of a merger of 10 banks. However, it took many years before a system of Islamic banking was implemented. The 1983 Usury-Free Banking Act allowed for two types of deposit: interest-free savings and current accounts and short- and long-term investment accounts. It took another three years before the system was in operation. The result, according to one Iranian banker is that Iran's domestic banks have become 'glorified post offices.' The aim of the legislation was for customers to use the banks to make transactions rather than money. However, the Act also allowed banks to give prizes and bonuses on the interest-free accounts and to pay profits on the investment accounts. The banks pay interest out of their profits and charge a fee for loans. The rate paid is determined by the Supreme Council of Banks, a body whose members include Mr Mohsen Nurbakhsh, the minister for economics and finance, Mr Mohammad Adeli, the governor of the central bank, and managing directors of the banks. Iran's overseas banking operations have not been included in the Islamic system and they have continued to operate interest-paying banking. The banking system is dominated by the role of the Bank Markazi which allocates foreign exchange to the domestic banks. The liberalisation measures involve loosening Bank Markazi's control over the domestic banks and encouraging competition between them. Before the reforms, Bank Markazi set annual limits on lending based on the previous year's figure plus 10 per cent. The domestic banks can now attract deposits and are obliged only to lodge a proportion of these with Bank Markazi. In order to attract more deposits, the rate offered on private sector deposits was increased in 1990 for the first time since the 1983 Usury-Free Act. The banks' fees on loans were also increased from a range of 4-12 per cent to 6-19 per cent. Last year the interest offered on deposits was again raised, this time by one percentage point. The rates were set at 14 per cent interest on five-year deposits in the year ended March 1992, 10 per cent on one-year deposits and 6.5 per cent on three-month deposits. Private deposits with the commercial and specialised banks rose from IR8,080bn in 1986-87 to IR18,850bn in 1990-91, the first year of the reforms. Of this amount, term investment deposits increased their proportion slightly from 60.8 per cent to 62.5 per cent. The Supreme Council of Banks, which usually sets the same rate of return for all banks, will now allow banks to set different rates in order to promote competition. The banks face competition not only between themselves but also with the bazaar where money-lenders charge interest at rates anywhere between 30 and 50 per cent. Bank Markazi has also called for the operation of private non-banking financial institutions, which the domestic banks are keen to establish, in order to take advantage of a relatively buoyant stock market. Banks, including Bank Melli, Iran's largest domestic bank, have set up joint stock investment companies to trade on the stock exchange. There is no suggestion at this stage, however, that the banks taken under state control after the revolution would be denationalised. One reform has caused much controversy outside Iran. Bank Markazi's decision in 1991 to draw back from providing guarantees for credits from abroad and to hand over the job to the state commercial banks is thought to be the main reason for the prolonged delay in Iran's ability to meet its payments for maturing letters of credit. Difficulties first arose last summer and despite expectations that this was to be a short-lived development, delays continue. According to one Iranian banker, the main reason for the delays is that previously foreign exchange requirements for letters of credit were allocated and cleared before the letter of credit was opened. This is no longer the case. The amount of foreign exchange income which the country would be earning was also over-estimated, leading to a shortfall of resources. However, Mr Adeli has been keen to stress that the delays are the result of bad management due to lack of expertise on the part of the commercial banks rather than a shortage of foreign exchange. Estimates of the amount of Iran's outstanding debt vary widely. The Basel-based Bank for International Settlements found that Iran's liabilities to commercial banks abroad reached a record high of Dollars 8.3bn in the second quarter of 1992 with assets dropping to Dollars 5.8bn. BIS figures show that Iran increased its liabilities by Dollars 4bn from September 1991 to June 1992 and the bank estimated total external indebtedness at about Dollars 15.5bn in June 1992. That figure is thought to have increased since then and current estimates are in the order of at least Dollars 20bn. Last autumn, western credit agencies ignored Bank Markazi's argument that because the banks are all state-owned, their guarantee is as good as one from Bank Markazi itself. They have called upon Iran's Ministry of Economy and Finance to guarantee payment for projects worth more than Dollars 50m. Other problems include a lack of trained managers and a weak management structure. Capital inadequacy and deficient technological resources also need to be tackled. Mr Adeli has said that local banks need to be brought to international capital adequacy standards which he indicated should be achieved by the end of 1993. Bank Melli, for example, the country's largest bank after Bank Markazi, is ranked within the top 100 banks in the world because of the size of its assets - Dollars 125.8bn at the end of March 1991, according to The Banker - but is ranked by The Banker 383 in the world due to its capital assets ratio of 0.43 per cent. Despite the drawbacks, Iran's banking system maintains many of its positive features. It is long-established and well-developed compared to many countries in the Middle East - a system with a wide branch network throughout the world reflecting the importance of trade to the country. Despite all the economic problems and political turmoil, the banking system has proved itself resilient and resourceful.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                      IRAN'S TOP FIVE BANKS (Dollars m)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                              Tier One   Capital/assets  Pre-tax                               capital      ratio (%)    profits   Assets  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1 Bank Saderat Iran            1,511         2.48         n/a    61,028 2 Bank of Industry and Mine    1,232        11.77         n/a    10,463 3 Bank Melli Iran                538         0.43          28   125,790 4 Bank Mellat                    473         1.19          73    39,722 5 Bank Tejarat                   469         1.47          19    31,844  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: The Banker, July 1992  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

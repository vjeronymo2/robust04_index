			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In order to facilitate daily pricing and margin evaluations, PTC intends to acquire Trepp's CMO pricing model. Currently, PTC receives a price tape from Trepp daily no later than 5 p.m. and meets regularly with representatives from Trepp regarding its pricing service. Nevertheless, as the volume of CMOs deposited at PTC increases, the on-site availability of the Trepp model should provide PTC with additional safeguards. <FOOTCITE>24</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 24 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Letter from Michael D. Frieband, dated March 4, 1994,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  note 5. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> PTC's proposed methodology requires its model to predict accurately the market price of CMOs. Thus far, PTC's experience has been limited to comparing the predicted versus actual transation price of VA REMICs. <FOOTCITE>25</FOOTCITE>  The data indicate that PTC's model has been reasonably accurate in predicting actual prices. <FOOTCITE>26</FOOTCITE>  However, VA REMICs represent the most stable of CMOs given that VA mortgages are assumable, and therefore less subject to prepayment risk. Moreover, the structures of the VA REMICs so far issued and on deposit at PTC have not been particularly complicated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 25 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> VA REMICs are the only CMOs currently depository eligible at PTC. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 26 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See letter from Michael D. Frieband, dated August 17, 1993,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  note 5. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Another concern raised by the proposed methodology relates to the prepayment projections on which it relies. The prepayment projections volunteered by twelve firms are averaged, but whether such quotes are executable is not considered. This may affect the accuracy of the prepayment speeds used to arrive at a market price for CMOs. Without accurate prepayment data, the predicted price might lag behind the market's true price by up to 30&hyph;45 days, when each agency issuing mortgage pass-through securities releases the actual prepayment factors  <FOOTCITE>27</FOOTCITE>  and settlement occurs. The interest rate volatilities of the underlying Treasuries from which the CMOs are priced can change 50&hyph;75 basis points over the course of 30&hyph;45 days. In part to address this concern, PTC has determined to use fifty basis points for purposes of running the stress test to establish margin. <FOOTCITE>28</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 27 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> A factor represents the fractional share of the original principal that remains in a given pool of mortgages comprising a mortgage pass-through security ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> e.g., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  a factor of .7 indicates that 70% of a pool's principal remains). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 28 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See letter from Leopold S.

In addition, the temporary approval period will allow PTC to take steps to address any concerns which exist with respect to its methodology. <FOOTCITE>29</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 29 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> PTC has represented that it will provide the following information to the Commission prior to the expiration of the temporary approval period: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) PTC will explain what criteria it uses in identifying certain CMO tranches as more volatile and/or risky than other tranches. PTC will recalculate margin for any tranche whenever the Treasury yield curve has changed by 100 basis points from the time of original issue or last recalculation; however, until it establishes clear standards, PTC will reevaluate margins for all tranches at least twice a year, in addition to reevaluating selected tranches quarterly; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) PTC will consider using a model other than its present modelling vendor to conduct the stress test (or serve as the present vendor's back up), as opposed to relying on a single vendor both for the stress test and as a source of daily pricing; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) PTC will address the treatment of non-par issuances, which tend to be more sensitive to changes in interest rates than other CMOs; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) PTC will explain the method by which its present modelling source aligns a CMO with a referenced Treasury maturity; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) PTC has stated its intention to modify its systems software to make automated price comparisons possible, and PTC will expedite the automation of its comparison of predicted versus actual CMO transation price data. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> See letter from Leopold S.

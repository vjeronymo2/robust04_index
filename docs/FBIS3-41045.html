Defense Minister Warns About Possible Catastrophe"]    [Text] Yesterday the Ukrainian Supreme Council tasked the  Council of Ministers with "stepping up efforts" to sign specific  treaties on compensation for the nuclear weapons to be removed  from Ukraine. As for Ukraine's accession to the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty, it was decided to consider the question  at a separate Supreme Council meeting. Foreign Minister  Anatoliy Zlenko said that "Ukraine has considerably tarnished  its image as an international partner by reneging on its  promises." Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskiy sweetened the  pill by saying that Ukraine is a powerful space state that will  in time be capable of manufacturing delivery vehicles and  weapons on its own. But later he said that the storage time of  the combat nuclear blocs, where uncontrollable physical  processes may begin, is drawing to an end and that "the  Chernobyl catastrophe would pale beside what might happen."    Mr. Kravchuk, on his part, said that he received a telegram  from U.S. President Clinton on 3 February saying that the United  States plans to double its aid for dismantling nuclear weapons  in Ukraine.</p>

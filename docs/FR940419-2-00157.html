An HA that intends to use funds under this paragraph must identify in its CIAP Application, the estimated number of units proposed for Other Modernization and subsequent sale. In addition, an HA must certify that: the proposed modernization under this paragraph would result in bringing the identified units into full compliance with the homeownership objectives under the Turnkey III Program; and the HA has homebuyers who both are eligible for homeownership, in accordance with the regulatory requirements, and have demonstrated their intent to be placed into each of the Turnkey III units proposed for Other Modernization. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Before an HA may be approved for Other Modernization of a unit under this paragraph, it must first deplete any Earned Home Payments Account (EHPA) or Non-Routine Maintenance Reserve (NRMR) pertaining to the unit, and request the maximum operating subsidy. Any increase in the value of a unit caused by its Other Modernization under this paragraph shall be reflected solely by its subsequent appraised value, and not by an automatic increase in its purchase price. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (b) Mutual Help Developments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Mutual Help developments are eligible for the same physical and management improvement costs as are rental developments.

However, if the HA is not successful in obtaining CIAP funds for in-place management measures, the HA may request a budget revision of previously approved, but unobligated CIAP funds to accomplish such measures. Where the HA had a CIAP budget revision approved for this purpose in FY 1993, the HA may request FY 1994 CIAP funds to complete the items which were eliminated as a result of the budget revision. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

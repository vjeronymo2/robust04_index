			<p><P> November 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> ON VIEW: THE 'FUTURE PART II' ARRIVES -- WITH A BONUS  </P> <P> Futuristic. Fabulous. Foxy. Fun. Funny. Friendly. The world premiere of "Back  to the Future Part II" last week, drawing 1,500 guests to the Cineplex Odeon  Universal City Cinemas (four theaters), was all that. The bonus was that it  benefited TRIPOD to help families with hearing-impaired children.  </P> <P> Chairman Mary Ellen Trainor Zemeckis said: "We've got $400,000 tonight. Net.  TRIPOD's a great organization. It's about the future of children, and this is  about the future."  </P> <P> The crowd couldn't get close enough to star Michael J. Fox and wife Tracy  Pollan (in slinky black) and to Robert Zemeckis, the director. With three party  tents connected by black time tunnels, Fox was hard to find.  </P> <P> But there he was, in the roped '50s area, surrounded by Universal president Tom  Pollock, Bob Gale, Steve Starkey, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson, Thomas  Wilson. Close by were James Woods, Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell, Arnold  Schwarzenegger and Maria Shriver, Michael Douglas, Michael Valenti, Chevy  Chase, Woody Harrelson, Mark Cowan and Mary Shea, Peter and Robin Barker, and  Michael Shamberg and his wife, Megan Williams, who helped start TRIPOD seven  years ago.  </P> <P> Most parties have one tent. Ambrosia Caterers vice president David Corwin  created three. The "past" became a pleasure palace with gaming tables; the '50s  tent sported a mermaid and band with dancers bopping through balloons and  tinsel to "Hit the Road, Jack." The futuristic setting took the form of steel  grids and a bar in an atmosphere too dark to see stars, but providing anonymity  for pigging out.  </P> <P> Beamed MCA president Sid Sheinberg: "This movie's like a Swiss watch." So was  the party.  </P> <P> PAST PERFECT: The business tycoons ventured into archeology the other evening  when John and Marion Anderson opened their Bel-Air home to the Board of  Visitors of the John E. Anderson Graduate School of Management at UCLA (which  the Andersons endowed with $15 million).  </P> <P> The prominent group became the first to see Christopher B. Donnan's newest  slides of the royal tombs from the Moche civilization discovered recently in  Peru. Donnan, professor of anthropology and director of the UCLA Museum of  Cultural History, said the tombs have yielded some of the greatest pieces of  jewelry ever found in the Americas.  </P> <P> Oohing over the gold warrior priest and intricate spiders were J. Clayburn La  Force, dean of the Graduate School of Management, and wife Barbara, Jim and  Carol Collins, Dick and Susan Roll, Jim and Inge Miscoll and political  economist James Q. Wilson.  </P> <P> DONORS: Celebrating the continued building of a significant permanent  collection for Los Angeles and the Museum of Contemporary Art, MOCA, headed by  Richard Koshalek, recently dedicated the Collection Donor Galleries at Bunker  Hill and opened two exhibitions including "Selections from the Beatrice and  Philip Gersh Collection."  </P> <P> About 300 friends of the Gershes including Jeff Kastenberg, Steve Martin,  Marcia Weisman and Ed Ruscha were there; 50 moved on to late-night dining at  Rex restaurant.  </P> <P> ELEGANCE: Mary Smith (Mrs. William French Smith) and Bullocks Wilshire cast  floral elegance on the luncheon to meet London's floral decorator Kenneth  Turner, in town to open his new boutique at Bullocks Wilshire and to tout the  Southern California Committee for Shakespeare's Globe Theatre.  </P> <P> Guests included Michael York (quoting Shakespeare), I. Magnin CEO Rose Marie  Bravo, Constance Gavin (just returned from Las Cruces), Iona Brown, Joan  Hotchkis, Jennifer Diener, Flora Thornton and Marion Jorgensen.  </P> <P> TO HONOR: Mayor of Cannes Michel Mouillot was in the spotlight last week.  Chardee and Thomas Trainer feted him in their Beverly Hills home, inviting  former President Ronald and Nancy Reagan. French Consul Gen. Gerard and Naomi  Coste hosted another reception Wednesday at their home.  </P> <P> Chardee Trainer is a trustee of Pine Manor College, which is co-sponsoring a  program of French studies at the International College of Cannes, where the  mayor is chairman.  </P> <P> BACCHUS: The ancient Greek and Roman god of wine and revelry was revered the  other evening at the California Wine Patrons at the Regent Beverly Wilshire.  </P> <P> Before dinner, hotelier Alain M. Longatte saluted 13th annual Bacchus Banquet  awardees: restaurateur Michael McCarty, Domaine Chandon CEO John Wright and Los  Angeles Times wine writer Dan Berger.  </P> <P> News of the night was the opening of the California Wine Exhibit at the Museum  of Science and Industry to pay tribute to Hernando Courtright, late owner of  the Beverly Wilshire. Among those in the spotlight were Fiorenza Courtright,  Jack P. Hennessy, chairman of the California Wine Patrons, Raoul Balcaen,  Patrons president, and Bob and Margie Petersen.  </P> <P> PLAUDITS: To Frank and Barbara McNamara, celebrating a 40th anniversary with  dinner and friends at Annandale Golf Club. . . .  </P> <P> To Pitzer College President Frank Ellsworth and supporters, raising funds at  the Universal benefit screening of "Dad." . . .  </P> <P> To the Bob Hope Cultural Center Muses and their "Best of Paris" fashion  extravaganza in Palm Desert co-chaired by Marilyn Tennity and Robin Ceriale. .  . .  </P> <P> To Janet and Bob Christy and members of Applause, fund-raising for the Norris  Theatre for the Performing Arts (Palos Verdes Peninsula) with a tour of  corporate jets. . . .  </P> <P> To Alli Solum, chairing Trojan League benefit for USC Law Center.  </P></p>

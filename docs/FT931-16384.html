			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / Boat industry takes hopeful soundings: Richard Gourlay reports that traditional Earls Court optimism has a ring of truth this year IN THE past four weeks, Marine Projects of Plymouth has sold three 65-ft motor yachts at Pounds 650,000 each to Dutch, German and French clients. At the other end of the scale, Hunter Boats of Essex reports that sales of yachts at about Pounds 40,000 have picked up in the past three months. After two battering years, exhibitors descending on Earls Court for this week's London Boat Show will cling to such anecdotes. For the first time since the market peaked in 1990, though, the optimism that is a fixture of the show carries a ring of truth. 'There is reason to believe that we have hit bottom in the UK,' says Mr David King, managing director of Marine Projects. 'We do now have a market in the UK, whereas going back three months there was no market at all.' Such signs of recovery remain faint and are not evident across the industry. Many chandlers are facing great difficulties and have not even enjoyed the benefit of owners re-equipping rather than trading in their boats. Marina operators, who have lost some of boating's 1980s newcomers - or were too late attracting them - are continuing to suffer as much as any company in the property sector. But builders with export markets have received a boost from the devaluation of sterling in September. The greatest beneficiaries are likely to be the large motor boat builders - Sunseekers, Marine Projects and Fairline Boats. Smaller operators, in what has always been a highly fragmented industry, are less likely to be able to bear the cost of exporting and will have to wait for UK demand to pick up. Devaluation will also reduce import penetration from continental Europe, in particular from Scandinavia and Belgium, and from US companies, which some UK builders say took advantage of an overvalued pound. Nevertheless, there are storm clouds gathering over the industry in the very countries that have helped keep the builders afloat. Exports already accounted for Pounds 139m of total leisure boat sales of Pounds 238m in 1991. Now the vitality of some of those foreign markets is threatened. Japan's economic troubles have drastically cut demand that was beginning to take off after a switch in fashion away from golf. The downturn in the German economy is threatening UK builders' largest single export market, although so far they have not seen any fall in demand. The last two years of recession has brought one clear benefit from UK boat builders' point of view. In the 1980s, French boat builders, led by Beneteau and Jeaneau, made great inroads into the traditional UK builders' market share. They appeared to provide what the new rich wanted from their sailing. That new mass market has now disappeared and British industry watchers believe that French market share has fallen with it. As one UK builder disparagingly says: 'The newcomers were attracted by the kind of boats that sold well at boat shows' - where the French flourished. If the rot in the UK industry has indeed been stopped, it would not be before time. Many builders, such as Fairline and Marine Projects, have trimmed their work-forces. Some have lost 40 per cent of production over the past two years. Many more have either gone out of business entirely or, like Westerly of Portsmouth, have returned via the liquidators in much slimmed-down form. Fairline, the only quoted boatbuilder in the UK, made a Pounds 500,000 loss in the year to September and halved its dividend, although it booked a record number of orders in November. Sales by the industry as a whole, including leisure and commercial boatbuilders, marina operators, sailmakers and suppliers of electronic equipment, has shrunk by more than 25 per cent in two years. In 1991 sales fell 19 per cent to Pounds 1.122bn with motor and sailing yachts falling 16 per cent, according to the British Marine Industries Federation. Mr Tony Beechey, the federation's executive chairman, believes the fall continued last year but at a slower pace, while 1993 will see overall sales on a similar level. Equipment sales, however, have remained buoyant with sales in 1991 of Pounds 284m, much of it exported. As the boating industry gathered in London yesterday, there was even a degree of optimism surrounding the European Commission's closure last month of the much-used loophole that allowed buyers of boats to avoid paying value added tax. 'The worst part of the VAT issue has been the lack of decisions from Brussels,' says Mr Beechey. No one is quite sure how sales will be affected. Some of the more bullish salesmen are using VAT as part of the sales pitch. In a classic demonstration of clutching at straws, one builder says the chancellor could solve his funding problems by raising VAT rates in the spring. To avoid the increase, yachtsmen should buy now. Weathering the storm, Page 12</p>

			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / Unease in UK over Bosnia troops decision THERE WAS foreboding rather than celebration in Whitehall yesterday over Mr John Major's decision to send up to 1,800 troops to Bosnia. Nor was there much optimism that next week's London conference would ease the pressures which forced the UK prime minister to reverse his long-standing opposition to the commitment of British ground forces. Despite the sharp lines drawn around the commitment - the lightly-armed troops will operate under United Nations auspices, will escort only those convoys granted right of passage by the warring factions and may be withdrawn at any point - no one is sure that it does not mark the beginning of a much more perilous military entanglement. Mr Major's sombre demeanour after a six-hour meeting on Tuesday with his senior ministers and military advisers signalled that he is as concerned as ever that British soldiers may be dragged into a bloody war which outside forces could not win. He does not believe that the conflict can be solved by western military intervention. Talk of 'surgical' air strikes to force an end to Serbian sieges of Bosnia's Moslem communities is rejected as 'sheer fantasy'. Many more innocent civilians than Serbian fighters would be killed, he believes. British generals estimate that the other large-scale military option canvassed in an impatient media - that of criss-crossing the disputed territory with heavily-defended and permanent aid corridors - would involve up to 300,000 western troops. 'That is a war and no-one should fool themselves otherwise,' Mr Major told his colleagues before resuming his Spanish holiday. As Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, emphasised yesterday, Britain's view that 'in the end this is going to be settled, if it is going to be settled, by pressure and talks, talks and pressure'. But that will take time. The best that is hoped of next week's London peace conference is that it will increase the pressure by tightening the sanctions net on Serbia; and will set the framework for more talks by publicly committing the international community to the principles which must guide future negotiations. Mr Major was acutely aware that such an outcome would not satisfy public opinion. The vivid television images of the suffering in Bosnia had begun to tarnish his political image at home and to threaten the authority of Britain's EC presidency. At Tuesday's meeting he was presented with estimates from his advisers suggesting that up to two million civilians in the former Yugoslavia faced acute food and medical shortages this winter. As one senior minister put it: 'Inaction was no longer an option'. So after a painstaking review of all the options the decision was taken that ground troops were needed to accelerate the humanitarian aid effort. It was not a decision taken easily. Senior officials denied that the length of the meeting - which agreed also to send Tornado fighters to secure an air exclusion zone in southern Iraq - reflected a split. But they agreed that the prime minister had agonised over every detail. Although the government insists that the troops, in blue berets, will travel only with convoys on routes negotiated by UN agencies, it acknowledges that they will return fire if attacked. If that happens the choice might be to commit still more troops or withdraw. For the moment the opposition parties are backing the action. Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, offered his backing after a telephone call from the prime minister. Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, has repeatedly called for more determined action. But Mr Major is astute enough to know that the public and political moods could change. In the appropriately brutal language of one senior Whitehall official yesterday: 'What will opinion demand when the bodies start coming back?'</p>

He said that he had agreed on this with his  Hungarian counterpart, Peter Boross, at their meeting on  Wednesday [12 January] in Prague.    Slovakia and Hungary should not impair each other in the  present situation, Meciar said. Slovakia is willing to conclude  a "major (interstate) treaty," to negotiate the creation of a  customs union and the opening of several new border crossings,  Meciar stated, stressing that essential decisions could be  expected only after the forthcoming Hungarian parliamentary  elections.    In accepting the Partnership for Peace project, the  countries  involved have also committed themselves to maintain democracy,  observe human and minority rights, and honor current state  borders, Meciar said.    Under documents it has adopted, Slovakia will guarantee its  Hungarian minority the international standard of human rights,  but will not tolerate any more pressure, Meciar emphasized. It  is necessary to stop efforts to create autonomous bodies, change  the political situation in some regions' administration, push  for autonomy aimed at the spheres of finances and security, and  "to prevent developments from escalating further," Meciar stated.</p>

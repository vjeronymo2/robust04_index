			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / Survey of Swindon (10): High on the mailing list - Swindon has a large share of the UK's distribution business THE Post Office's bulk handling centre in Swindon deals with between 3m and 6.5m items each week or an average of more than 230m items a year, one of the highest throughputs of any bulk mail office in Europe. This is the measure of Swindon's big share in the growing business of direct mail order marketing and distribution. Well-known local companies which are heavy users of the bulk distribution service include Reader's Digest, W H Smith - the headquarters of the company's retail operations are located in the town - and a number of book clubs. But the company responsible perhaps more than any other for the development of Swindon as a bulk distribution centre is the Ralton Group, one of the UK's top five companies specialising in direct mail marketing. Soon after Ralton's relocation to Swindon from London in the late 1970s, the Post Office decided it had no option but to establish a bulk handling depot nearby to handle the volume of business. Every year, the overwhelming majority of the UK's 23m households are sent a TV licence demand and many of them also have to be sent a reminder. Some 2.3m shareholders in British Gas must be sent copies of the annual report and accounts to arrive on a date which complies with stock exchange rules. These are just two routine items of business for Ralton. With a core staff of 150, and another 100 casuals who can be called upon if required, Ralton has built up its business to the point where it inserts more than 150m items into paper or polythene envelopes every year and has the biggest polythene wrap mail operation in the country. Ralton's operation is multi-faceted. It is geared to handle everything from the simple insertion of a brochure into a Sunday newspaper colour magazine, to a complicated mail out, and running a complete direct marketing campaign. Individual clients pick and mix to the precise service they require, though, in practice, the minimum mail-out tends to be 50,000 envelopes. Below that figure Ralton's service ceases to be cost effective. The privatisation boom of the 1980s has been particularly beneficial to the company's growth, enabling Ralton to make the most of its long experience of handling the distribution of company reports and accounts. Mr James Arrowsmith, sales and marketing director of Ralton, reckons the group handles around 25 per cent of the report and account mailings of PLCs which have more than 50,000 shareholders. Stemming from its direct mailing experience, the group also knows a considerable amount about list management and list broking for business-to-business and consumer direct mailings. Targeting potential customers using direct mail techniques is becoming a very sophisticated business, though, Mr Arrowsmith stresses, there is still plenty of scope for development, bearing in mind US experience. The average US household receives 205 direct mail shots annually. The comparable figure for Europe is 46 direct mailings a year, an average which Ralton is hoping to increase greatly by a collaborative link-up which it recently organised with comparable direct mail companies on the Continent. Euro Net, as it is called, links up independent direct marketing companies in the main European Community member countries plus Norway, Sweden and Switzerland and offers companies or organisations the opportunity to run pan-European campaigns, yet deal with a single organisation. However, Ralton sees as the most important area of growth in the 1990s, the development of the group's telemarketing and product fulfilment services. An ever-increasing number of companies are turning to direct response advertising in newspapers and on television as the most cost-effective way of reaching their potential customers. Ralton is geared to handle all aspects of this business, from dealing with the telephone responses stemming from TV, radio and press campaigns, market research, the generation of sales leads, the building and refining of mailing lists, and sales promotion services. On the fulfilment side, it is not only geared to accepting and collating orders for that holiday brochure or special coffee jug offer, but to dispatching the orders as well. Because of its confidence in the growth in this side of its business, Ralton has installed a new telephone system in its telemarketing department which allows each telephone number to receive 30 incoming calls at a time. Mr Arrowsmith explains why. 'More and more companies are starting to use direct response advertising. In five years time I am confident our Telemarketing Division will be employing a staff of 100 which compares with 20 staff at present.' The Post Office, too, is gearing up for increased business. The bulk handling centre in Swindon has been put under the control of Royal Mail Streamline, a new subsidiary of the Royal Mail with 16 offices around the UK and its own independent distribution network to compete against the likes of Federal Express and TNT and avoid the normal Royal Mail network becoming overloaded. Bulk service users have the option of either delivering their mail already sorted and stamped or using what the Post Office describes as its deferred service, available at a discount. Mr John Bridgeman, the service liaison manager, explains: 'The customer delivers his mail early and gives us a target delivery date. We then prepare the mail for dispatch during quiet periods. By using our staff in this way, we are able to even out the peaks and troughs in delivery.'</p>

A certified Board Resolution, acknowledging responsibilities of sponsorship, long-term support of the project(s), willingness of Sponsor to assist the Owner to develop, own, manage and provide appropriate services in connection with the proposed project, and that it reflects the will of its membership.

However, in localities where HUD determines the time constraints of the funding round will not permit all of the required official actions ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , approval of Community Planning Boards) which are necessary to convey publicly-owned sites, a letter in the application from the Mayor or Director of the appropriate local agency indicating approval of conveyance of the site contingent upon the necessary approval action is acceptable and may be approved by the Field Office if it has satisfactory experience with timely conveyance of sites from that public body. In such cases, documentation shall also include a copy of the public body's evidence of ownership and identification of any restrictive covenants, including reverter clauses. For properties to be acquired from the RTC, include a copy of the RTC prepared Transaction Screen Checklist or Phase I Environmental Site Assessment, and applicable documentation, per the RTC Environmental Guidelines. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> [ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Note: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  A proposed project site may not be acquired or optioned from a general contractor (or its affiliate) which will construct the section 202 project or from any other development team member.] <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (b) Evidence that the project as proposed is permissible under applicable zoning ordinances or regulations, or a statement of the proposed action required to make the proposed project permissible and the basis for belief that the proposed action will be completed successfully before the submission of the commitment application ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , a summary of the results of any recent requests for rezoning on land in similar zoning classifications and the time required for such rezoning, preliminary indications of acceptability from zoning bodies,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> etc <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 18.

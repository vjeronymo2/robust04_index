			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / People: Thatcherite Pascall turns up at MAI David Pascall, the BP executive who chaired the National Curriculum Council until April, has turned up in the City as finance director of a division of MAI, the finance, media and information services group. It is no surprise that 44-year-old Pascall, a chemical engineer and 25-year veteran of BP, has left the oil giant. He had masterminded the controversial Project 90 reorganisation for Bob Horton, BP's ousted chief. It is understood to be Horton, a friend since St Andrews University days with the then minister for education John MacGregor, who raised Pascall's name as a suitable industrialist to become a member of the NCC in 1990. Pascall took on the chair a year later in what was seen at the time as a firmly political appointment by Kenneth Clarke, the next secretary for state. Branded a Thatcherite for his stint at No:10's policy unit in the mid-1980's, Pascall made no secret of his bitter disappointment when the job of chairman of the new School Curriculum and Assessment Authority  - which, he said, he had been given strong indications he would be offered  - was given to the apolitical Sir Ron Dearing. 'Everyone thinks that all of education is a mess,' he adds about his time at NCC, 'but we have done significant work on the curriculum; Sir Ron now needs to do the same on testing'. Meanwhile,Pascall says Lord Hollick, MAI chief executive, made him 'a very interesting offer'. He joins in the newly created capacity of finance director of the money and securities broking division, but does not go on the main board. The division has six regional finance directors, who will report into Pascall. Pascall's varied career included four years in BP's finance department, at the time of the government share sale and then during the MMC inquiry into the Kuwaiti Investment Office's shareholding. He had earlier done an MBA specialising in finance at Inseat under BP sponsorship.</p>

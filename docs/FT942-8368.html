			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / International Company News: Cost-cutting aids Esselte advance Esselte, the Swedish office products group, lifted first quarter pre-tax profits by 11 per cent as higher margins and cost-cutting helped to compensate for lower sales. Profit for the period totalled SKr121m (Dollars 15.7m), up from SKr109m in the same 1993 period. Sales amounted to SKr3bn, down 2 per cent from 1993 after adjusting for exchange rates. Mr Bo Lundquist, chief executive, said the full-year result was expected to be better than the SKr301m achieved in 1993. Esselte said its result had been hit by a SKr9m charge after a dispute with a pension fund over a property deal.</p>

			<p><P> January 2, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POSTSCRIPT: LOTTO WINNER STILL HAS HER GOALS -- PLUS A BMW, YACHT AND FIANCE  </P> <P> When 20-year-old Christene E. Lentz of Capistrano Beach won $19.58 million in  California's Lotto game in August, the first question fired at her at a news  conference was: "So, you got a boyfriend?"  </P> <P> Lentz laughed and answered: "I probably have a lot of boyfriends right now!"  </P> <P> Today, she is engaged, drives a new car, owns a 43-foot yacht and has bought a  new home for her grandmother.  </P> <P> And that's not all.  </P> <P> "The biggest change is that now I can spend money when I go shopping instead of  just looking," she said with a laugh.  </P> <P> The day she struck it rich, Lentz said, she had been wondering how she would  make the next $200 payment on her silver 1984 Nissan Sentra with $11 left in  her checking account.  </P> <P> "I had made three monthly payments before it happened," said Lentz, a  Saddleback College sophomore majoring in theater arts. "The next payment I paid  it off." Now, Lentz glides around in a white BMW 325i with a black convertible  top.  </P> <P> It was on Aug. 25 that Lentz and a Riverside truck driver split a $39-million  Lotto jackpot. She will receive a $783,200 check every year for 20 years.  </P> <P> "I was always happy," Lentz said last week. "Now, I'm ecstatic."  </P> <P> Still living with her parents and working for her mother's company, National  Aerospace Supply in Anaheim, Lentz has received six marriage proposals --  several in jest -- since hitting the numbers.  </P> <P> But the one that counts came from her boyfriend, 19-year-old Charles Cooper of  Colton, just before the Lotto numbers popped out that night in August. "If you  win the lottery tonight, will you marry me?" Lentz recalls him asking.  </P> <P> They were engaged Oct. 2 and plan to be married July 15.  </P> <P> Cooper, a machinist who works for his father, has been dating Lentz off and on  for about 2 1/2 years, she said. They began dating while both were high school  students in Colton, where the Lentz family lived before moving to Capistrano  Beach last June.  </P> <P> "We had talked about marriage before," Lentz said. "But we didn't have the  money."  </P> <P> Said her mother, Joyce: "I love him. He's every mother's dream. I always yelled  at her when they broke up."  </P> <P> During the 3 weeks after she won the Lotto, Lentz received a flood of inquiries  from investors and a ton of missives seeking money.  </P> <P> "You just kind of have to put them aside," Lentz said. "But I read a lot of sad  things. Most people are too embarrassed to ask you for money to your face."  </P> <P> "Except me," her mother said.  </P> <P> Lentz said one of her biggest headaches has been handling paper work now that  she has a lawyer, a financial adviser and an accountant.  </P> <P> "I also had to prepare a will," she said.  </P> <P> Besides the BMW and the yacht -- which is still in Dallas at a former family  getaway spot -- Lentz's major acquisitions include a Gucci purse and wallet  (for $500) and lots of clothes. Her only exotic journey so far has been a trip  with Cooper to visit his relatives and go sightseeing in Washington and  Virginia.  </P> <P> "We were gone 4 days, and I missed home," Lentz said.  </P> <P> She also has donated money for scholarships at Fontana Christian School, where  she went to elementary school, and Colton High School. She set up a trust fund  for her sister and has made a number of investments, she said.  </P> <P> But Lentz said money hasn't changed her basic goals. "I still want to be a  theater arts teacher."  </P> <P> She and Cooper plan to finish college and have decided they want four children.  Lentz hopes to earn her teaching certificate, and Cooper wants to pursue an  engineering degree.  </P> <P> As for Lentz's family, they are trying to take the windfall in stride.  </P> <P> "I don't expect her to support me for the rest of my life," said her mother,  who started her own company 3 years ago.  </P> <P> "I hope not," Lentz said.  </P> <P> Her sister, Collene, said she finds all the attention embarrassing. But she  doesn't mind the money. "I still like shopping too," she said.  </P> <P> And what about the Lotto? Does lightning ever strike twice?  </P> <P> Said Lentz: "I played last night."  </P></p>

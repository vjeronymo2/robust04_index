			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Letter of Minister of Internal Affairs V. Yerin to First </F> Deputy Minister of Economics of the Russian Federation A.G.  Shapovalyants reported by the NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA  investigative service: "Now It Is Becoming Clear Why Ilyumzhinov  Relinquished the Post of President of Kalmykia"]    [Text] To First Deputy Minister of Economics of the Russian  Federation A.G. Shapovalyants Concerning Disclosures of  Violations in the Use of Credit Resources of the Steppe  Association.    Dear Andrey Georgiyevich!    The Ministry of Internal Affairs [MVD] of Russia is  conducting a check on the fact of illegal use of state credit  resources by a number of managers of state and commercial  structures.    It has been preliminarily established that in  September-November 1992 the Central Bank of the Russian  Federation, on a petition of Rostekstil, the Russian state  concern for the production of textile commodities, in the person  of B.M. Fomin, president, issued a favorable special credit for  the total sum of 14 billion rubles [R] to the Steppe Commercial  Bank (Republic of Kalmykia). The indicated sum was intended for  extending credit to enterprises of the Rostekstil concern for  the purchase and processing of wool.    The redistribution of the credit resources of the commercial  bank Steppe led to the fact that a basic sum of credit to the  extent of R10.4 billion was received by the Steppe Association  (Republic of Kalmykia), which is not part of the Rostekstil  structure, and, in accordance with the contract, it fulfills the  functions of a dealer organization of the concern.    In its turn, under the pretense of the purchase of wool, the  Steppe Association concluded a number of contracts with  commercial enterprises in the cities of Moscow, St. Petersburg,  and Nizhniy Tagil, stipulating a large interest fine for  nonfulfillment of contractual conditions. Actually, fine  penalties were a hidden form of payment of interest for credit  received from the Steppe Association.    The return of credit resources to the Steppe Commercial Bank  was scheduled for 26 April 1993. In connection with the fact  that, owing to the squandering of credit monetary resources, the  Steppe Association and, consequently, the Steppe Commercial Bank  as well, were unable to pay off the existing indebtedness by the  indicated date, the date for the return of credits was postponed  on Fomin's petition, without adequate grounds, until the end of  1993.    The measures that were conducted exposed the selfish  interests of a number of senior officials of organs of authority  and administration in the receipt and use of favorable credit  resources.    In February of 1993, during registration of the San  Corporation, a privately held joint-stock company with the  rights of a trading house, the Rostekstil concern, its founder,  acted as a juridical person and its president, B.M. Fomin--a  holder of 15 shares of stock (7.5 percent) of the capital fund  of the corporation--acted as one of its physical persons.    K.N. Ilyumzhinov (president of the Republic of Kalmykia at  the present time) was elected president of the San Corporation.    For the purpose of extracting profits from the illegal use  of  credit resources, Ilyumzhinov opened the Steppe Commercial Bank  in Elista, whose founder became the heads of commercial  enterprises: the San Corporation, TOO [limited partnership]  Kiminek, and the Sar firm, and B.M. Fomin became a member of the  board of the bank.    It should be noted that the capital fund of the Steppe  Commercial Bank totaled R150 million, of which R100 million was  money stolen earlier through false credit advice notes by S. B.  Terloyev and L. Yuferev, managers of the commercial enterprises  APKO [not further identified] Cosmos and AO [joint-stock  company] Continent, which embezzled a grand total of more than  R20 billion.    Simultaneously with the opening of the Steppe Commercial  Bank, Ilyumzhinov, also with Fomin's assistance, organized the  Steppe Association, whose activity amounted to the accumulation  and resale of substantial monetary resources at the expense of  allocated state credit resources.    At the present time, without conducting documentary  inspections, it is impossible to determine the total damage  caused the state by the illegal use of credits, and also the  profit received by the Steppe Association. However, it is  already known now that Ilyumzhinov and his circle, under the  guise of purchasing wool, conducted a concealed conversion of  monetary resources for a total sum of more than $7 billion with  the subsequent placement of hard currency in the accounts of  foreign firms, including R2.5 million to the personal account of  a private person in the Republic of Poland. To the present time,  the foreign partners have not fulfilled their obligations to  deliver wool and food products, and they are continuing to use  the currency for their personal purposes.    It should be noted that the Aquarius System Interface  joint-stock company (city of Moscow) whose manager, T.I.  Gasanov, was the minister of industry in Ilyumzhinov's  government, was involved in the conversion and transfer of hard  currency to Poland.    At the present time, a check is being made on the fact of  delivery of industrial commodities to the Steppe Association  from the Gender firm for the sum of $250,000 under the guise of  humanitarian assistance.    Citizen V. Dzhambinov, who is the deputy to the permanent  representative of the president of Kalmykia under the president  of Russia, participated in the receipt and sale of the goods in  question.    There are reasons to believe that the Gender firm purchased  the "humanitarian" assistance in question for hard currency  received earlier from Ilyumzhinov.    Dzhambinov transferred the R95 million from the sale of the  received commodities to the Steppe bank (to the current account  of the Ilyumzhinov fund), and R40 million through false  documents to the city of Moscow for the Tau firm.    Preliminary analysis of available materials of  financial-economic activity of the commercial enterprises under  the control of Ilyumzhinov makes it possible to reach a  conclusion concerning the lack of any kind of substantial  monetary resources at his disposal to pay off the indebtedness  for credit in the full amount, and, what is more, using them for  the development of the republic's economy.    [Signed] Minister V. Yerin    From the editorial office: NOVAYA  YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA and KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA have written more  than once about K. Ilyumzhinov's "shady" funds and affairs.  However, the president of Kalmykia, in dissolving the soviets,  was useful to B.N. Yeltsin in the spring and summer of 1993.  Now, after his demonstrative friendship with A. Rutskoy, and in  view of the new strategy of the Kremlin ("Give back the  sovereignty that you at one time gulped down"), Ilyumzhinov is  being worked over. In the beginning, the criminal funds did not  intimidate the president of the Russian Federation, and now,  with their exposure, Ilyumzhinov can be "broken," which has been  done. The editorial office has in its possession a number of  documents with the very highest endorsements. We will acquaint  the readers of NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA with them in the next  few issues.    [Signed] Yakhya Akiyev</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ibrahim Rugova, president of the republic of </F> Kosova, by reporter Bujar Muharremi in the Albanian Television  studio -- live]    [Text] [Muharremi] Dear viewers; I greet you from the  studio of the satellite program and invite you to view a  conversation with president of the republic of Kosova Dr.  Ibrahim Rugova, who is our guest tonight.    Mr. Chairman, it has been several months since our last  conversation and I think there have been many problems that have  given rise to this conversation, considering also the fact that  you are continuing contacts at the highest level in Europe  regarding the Kosova issue.    I would like to greet our television viewers wherever they  may be, in Albania, Kosova, Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav  Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], Germany, Sweden, Denmark,  Norway, and in all other countries where they are temporarily  working and living.    I would like to inform you, dear viewers, that in our  conversation with Chairman Rugova, you will have the possibility  to call us directly on numbers 426-08 and 425-01.    Mr. Chairman, I greet you and thank you for taking part in  our satellite program.    [Rugova] Allow me to thank you for this invitation to talk  again. As you noted, there have been many problems and there  still are. However, we should maintain our work consistently,  consider the situation first in Kosova and then in Albanian  areas and, of course, establish contacts with the world, our  friends, and foster contacts and sympathy. This is our  every-day job and we should do it.    [Muharremi] Mr. Chairman, I believe we can start our  conversation today with your recent visit, your last diplomatic  tour to several European countries. As we reported on our  satellite program, you recently paid an official visit to  Denmark, then stopped over in Norway, and then went again to  Germany. Your last stop was in France. Of course, Mr.  President, it is observed that your contacts reach top official  spheres. For example, in Denmark you met Prime Minister  Rasmussen and Foreign Minister Petersen. Are these meetings a  sign of the seriousness of the Kosova issue and the increasing  interest of European diplomacy?    [Rugova] I can say that it was really a cycle of visits or a  small tour in several European countries starting, as you  stressed, from Denmark. What was most important was the visit  to the North Atlantic Assembly, to which we were invited. The  talks we held there and our presentations were very successful  and important. I can say that the entire visit in general was  very successful and very productive. At the same time, I do  agree with you, because this illustrates the seriousness of the  issue and raises the Kosova issue to the level of the official  and state diplomatic circles of the European countries. I can  say that we received not only understanding, but also support  from these countries. These countries are very important not  only in the European Union, but also in the Atlantic Pact.    After these official contacts, I can say that, fortunately,  we have made many friends who, during these years, have visited  and helped Kosova -- friends who have been to Albania and have  helped Albania. I want to say that we have maintained contact  with them, as a popular saying goes: It is easy to make friends,  but it is difficult to keep them. We should keep these friends  and establish regular contacts in the future.    [Muharremi] Mr. President, could you describe some of the  main issues you raised during your last European tour?    [Rugova] We discussed the situation in Kosova, which is  always dangerous and tense. It is a situation of repression,  violence, and discrimination, or apartheid, as is said in Europe  nowadays. Secondly, we discussed the question of our political  plans -- the plan for Kosova, for the political solution of the  Kosova question. As you know, our political plan is for an  independent and neutral Kosova, open to Serbia and Albania. As  a preventive measure, we have requested a larger international  presence and protection for Kosova, as well as a protectorate or  civil administration as a transitional or temporary stage for  Kosova, in which life would be normalized and institutions would  function. We could then talk about the status and future of  Kosova. I hope that one day the Serbs will change their  viewpoints.    [Muharremi] Mr. Chairman, in an interview for Deutsche  Welle during your stay in Germany, you stressed that you favor  the option of the independence of Kosova. You also stressed that  an international civil protectorate would be a transitional  stage. How were these alternatives you presented received by  your main interlocutors?    [Rugova] I can say that there is understanding for the plan  and the viewpoint on the independence of Kosova, because this is  a result of the referendum we held in 1991, just like the other  peoples in the former Yugoslavia, Croats, Slovenes, Macedonians,  Bosniaks, and so forth. The other question, i.e. of an  administration or civil protectorate, is being carefully  considered. Of course, contacts and work are needed for this,  as well as pressure on the Serbian side to accept such a thing.    I can also say that there are different views on the  solution  of the situation in Kosova. However, these two topics are very  serious and should be carefully examined.    [Muharremi] Mr. President, you mentioned at the beginning of  the conversation that you visited Germany. On this occasion, you  had contacts with State Minister Helmut Schaefer, Bundestag  Foreign Policy Chairman Mr. Stercken, as well as other  high-level representatives of the German Government. To what  extent is the question of Kosova known and supported in Germany?    [Rugova] I can say that Germany is one of the first  countries to have shown interest in the Kosova situation and it  has done so for many years. Traditionally, it knows the Kosova  issue quite well and has so far supported it. We hope that  Germany will be more active, particularly now that it will be  taking over the European Union [EU] Presidency from 1 July. Then  after six months, France will assume it. During this stage, the  German side promises to be more committed to resolving the  Kosova issue.    [Muharremi] Mr. President, I think that another question  that would be of interest is this: In all these meetings and  political and diplomatic contacts you have had, how much is the  role and weight of the Albanian democratic state, and the figure  of President Berisha, felt in resolving the Kosova issue and the  national question?    [Rugova] I can say that after 50 years, it is our good  fortune to have started to have contacts and to cooperate. I  can say that the role of the democratic power in Albania,  President Berisha, and the government is very great. Today, this  role is important as Albania is entering international  institutions and organizations and represents and puts forward  our demands as well. Albania's support is invaluable and should  continue in this direction.    [Muharremi] Do you think that we have reached this stage,  i.e. a pan-Albanian global policy?    [Rugova] I think so. We have taken the first steps and now,  we are consolidating this policy. It is good that we have  managed to start a common policy, an Albanian global policy  regarding all topics and problems.    [Muharremi] Mr. President, it is clear that European policy  in general, from the lowest levels up to the highest circles,  manifests an evident concern and predisposition to resolve the  Kosova issue. Of course, in this framework Belgrade's and  Athens' positions seem to be out of tune. I would like to  stress here the Greek Government's position regarding your  participation in the North Atlantic Assembly proceedings. The  Greek Government considered it an act that runs counter to the  Atlantic Pact goals and impairs stability in the Balkans.  Please, Mr. President, what did you say in the meeting in Oslo?    [Rugova] Unfortunately, there was some reaction from Greece,  and perhaps Serbia. I would also like to say that a German lady  chairing the Committee of Civil Affairs said that even the Greek  delegation had agreed on my presence there. Regarding the  remarks and accusations that are circulating, they have no basis  and justification, as I presented the situation in Kosova, our  political plans, and the question of a political solution for  Kosova. These met with great understanding both in the Civil  and Political Affairs Committees. The success is important. Of  course, there will always be rumors and charges.    [Muharremi] What about the position of the Serbian  Government, considering the kind of official reaction it  maintained toward the German Government? Of course, the German  Government gave its answer -- Rugova is the highest  representative elected by free elections in a region inhabited  mainly by the Albanians of Kosova. How do you assess the German  Government's reaction in this case?    [Rugova] I consider it remarkably positive. I am used to  these reactions by the Serbian Government, with various attacks  and threats. That is why this is a sign of the nervousness of  that regime, which wants to isolate the Albanians more. That is  why the German Government accepts the legitimacy of the Albanian  representatives elected by free votes in the elections of two  years ago.    [Muharremi] Mr. President, do you think that these stances  maintained by the Greek and Serbian Governments in the context  of the events occurring in the region and the Balkans, and  particularly in the south, toward which Greece is presenting a  pretentious policy, are casual combinations or a fruit of old  relations in the Belgrade-Athens axis?    [Rugova] Unfortunately, some of our neighbors have always  worked in this way. We can consider this as either cooperation  or coincidence. However, we request from the Greek Government  that it be more tolerant, examine questions calmly, and  cultivate good neighborliness with Albania and Albanians in  general, as we are one factor in the Balkans.    Regarding the Serbian side, it is known that today it rules  Kosova by force. We are making efforts to find a political  solution to the Kosova issue.    [Muharremi] Mr. President, the ministerial meeting of  nonaligned countries was recently held in Cairo. You sent a  letter, a kind of message, to the leaders at the meeting. Of  course, foreign policy analysts noted the fact that Serbia had  not been invited to this nonaligned meeting, while it is well  known that for decades the former Yugoslavia was, as it were, a  country that relied on the nonaligned countries. Do you think  that this is a strong position, a reaction of the nonaligned  toward the current Serbian policy of violence and repression?    [Rugova] As you know, the nonaligned movement flourished in  the sixties and seventies. By the eighties it had begun to  weaken. The former Yugoslavia was a major country in the  movement and one of its founders. Of course, nowadays when new  states have emerged and are emerging from the former Yugoslavia,  they cannot accept Serbia, which is employing violence and  declaring war on other people and former regions. That is why it  was a good move that the Kosova issue was included as one of the  topics even in this conference. It was a good gesture for the  Kosova issue and that of Albanians in general.    [Muharremi] Mr. President, a new element of the Kosova  situation is, of course, the demand now being put forward by  both political and state figures and the media for a dialogue  between Serbia and the legitimate leadership of the Albanian  people of Kosova. Do you think that Serbia is ready for a  constructive dialogue with Kosovar personalities?    [Rugova] To tell the truth, there is a great effort being  made by the international community, many European countries,  and the United States to find possibilities for any dialogue in  various negotiations. From the start, we have been for dialogue  and for holding talks. So far the Serbian side has not shown  any sign that it is ready to talk. We request that these talks  be held under some supervision or in the presence of a third  party. That is why there is the readiness at the international  level to start something. As you know, two years ago we held  talks in the framework of the Geneva Conference on several  specific issues, but they yielded no results. Nevertheless, it  is necessary to hold talks.    [Muharremi] Mr. President, there are rumors that Serbia has  started a dialogue with separate individuals. Is this true, and  do these individuals enjoy the mandate of the Albanian people of  Kosova?    [Rugova] As you know, there have been contacts with several  parties of the Serbian opposition by some of our small parties.  Then, there have been contacts between Albanian and Serbian  intellectual groups. Meanwhile, it is known that individuals  can contact each other, no one can prevent them from doing so.  However, it is also known who has the mandate -- the elected  organs of Kosova. The various contacts that may have been  established are matters that are up to the individuals  themselves.    [Muharremi] Mr. President, I have another question for you.  Some time ago you spoke about -- and it is precisely the topic  we are discussing right now -- the need for dialogue with  Serbia. This is, of course, much spoken about and President  Berisha stressed it during his last visit to Romania, about the  need for a dialogue with the legitimate leaders of the Albanian  people of Kosova in the presence of a third party. Please, who  is or could this third party be?    [Rugova] To tell the truth, for the moment, the definition  of the third party is still.... As a side, we can say it should  be oneof the international or European institutions. As you  observe, the European Union, the United States, and Russia have  committed themselves to the questions in former Yugoslavia. I  think that in this connection a third party will be found for us  to supervise the talks under the auspices of the United Nations.    [Muharremi] Mr. President, another issue that I think is  of interest and worth addressing in this conversation is the  fact that much is spoken today, both in the international and  Albanian media, about peaceful resistance having always been  your political credo. This is and has always been highly valued  in the world. Here I would like to remind you that U.S. Vice  President Al Gore, who has praised your peaceful policy, German  Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel in his last interview with the  ZERI newspaper, and Mr. Peter Albright, the U.S. ambassador in  Zagreb, considered you the Albanian Mahatma Gandhi or Martin  Luther King. Are you convinced that this is the way to avoid  conflict and bloodshed in Kosova?    [Rugova] By all means. This is the way to avoid it. So far  we have managed, fortunately with the understanding of the  entire people, to escape a conflict, because as you know we have  no protection in Kosova. Since 1991, we have been left with no  protection in Kosova. Then, considerations about our movement  and the resistance of the Kosovar people are in fact  qualifications that allow the international and the Albanian  question to be regarded as a stabilizing and peaceful factor in  the Balkans and Europe. We have managed this through this  movement, which is both a need and our choice. It is a need  because we did not and do not want to move toward a catastrophe  and a tragedy. It is our choice because, in this way, we have  affirmed ourselves as a nation, as good-tempered people with  high human qualities and with a resistance that will unfailingly  yield its own results.    [Muharremi] Mr. President, during your visit to the  countries we mentioned, you stopped over in France, where you  had contacts with several French political figures. You met  Michel Rocard, chairman of the French Socialist Party, and Alain  Lamassoure, French minister for European Affairs. Can you  please tell us what were the problems you discussed with them  and what was their position on the Kosova issue?    [Rugova] Regarding these contacts, we have maintained  several contacts with other French parties, and now with the  Socialist Party at the highest level. As you know, the French  Socialist Party has supported our issue many times. We  discussed with Mr. Lamassoure the situation in Kosova and  possibilities for a dialogue to resolve the Kosova issue. I can  say that these are, more or less, regular contacts that we have  established with France, the French Government, and French  institutions.    [Muharremi] Mr. President, in this case, of course, it would  be permissible to mention here in this live conversation your  latest book, presented on the occasion of your visit to France,  titled: The Kosovo Issue -- Ibrahim Rugova -- The Kosovo Issue  [as heard].    Mr. President, of course, the book embodies a part of your  political opinions, a part of your attitudes, and your political  and diplomatic activity so far. Can you please tell us how was  the presentation of this book, which has political importance  for the Kosova issue, assessed by the French intellectuals and  the entire public?    [Rugova] To tell the truth, it was a special pleasure to  present this book in the framework of my visit there. The book  was prepared on the initiative of the Paris-based Committee for  Kosova by Mrs. (Marie Francoise Allain and Xavier Galmichte),  who compiled this book and worked a lot on it. They insisted  that we should work together because, as you know, given the  difficulty of movement, it is very difficult to enter and leave  Kosova. They really managed to write a very good book, a book  with interviews and long conversations, which present the  question of Kosova and other historical and judicial problems in  Kosova, i.e. what happened with the Albanians in a retrospective  way. The book has an introduction by our well-known writer  Ismail Kadare. It is important that in Paris, where we are not  very well represented with literature, a well-known publisher  like Fayard is publishing such a book at this time. It is a  readable book, more a story with a historical, scientific, and  political content than a discourse. I think that for the general  public, considering the assessments given in Paris, the book  would be very acceptable and popular for the Kosova issue and  the Albanian cause in general, as I do not have time now to  write books.    [Muharremi] Of course. Meanwhile, while we have been  talking, we have received many phone calls from our brothers of  the diaspora. First, a group of citizens from Switzerland wants  to greet you personally on your productive work in the interest  of the Albanian people and Kosova.    [Rugova] Thank you and we greet them together from your  studio.    [Muharremi] Eva Konini, a citizen from Tirana, asks: What  prospects lie in store for Kosova?    [Rugova] Everyone is aware of the situation there and you  know that it is grave. However, I think that Kosova has very  good prospects, as it possesses economic potential, rich natural  resources, as well as, like all Albanian areas, a human  potential, a new, active, and cultured population, 90 percent of  which is educated. We also have an economy, though it is  presently not functioning -- Kosova's economy was destroyed by  the Serbian regime -- and this is a good basis for future  development.    [Muharremi] Mr. President....    [Rugova] And of course, an open and not a closed Kosova. I  always say this.    [Muharremi] Mr. President, here is another question: What  is your opinion on the chances of parallel power in Kosova?    [Rugova] Ours is a legal power and the only power, but we  are presently occupied. There is an installed Serb power, which  is rudimentary. Our power there functions, as you know, in the  school system, a system of solidarity to survive and organize  our life, and this has surprised the world. That is why people  are supporting us in this organized and very rational resistance.    [Muharremi] Another question, Mr. President, comes from  Switzerland this time. Will the government be completed?    [Rugova] I have warned for a completion of the government  and it will be done, but carefully and it will take time. As  you know, a part of the government we had and we still have is  in Kosova and a part abroad, for reasons that are known, as the  government was not able to act several years ago. The  government has performed and is performing many important tasks  and, of course, through the strong cooperation we have with each  other, with all Kosovar institutions, the government, and  outside organizations.    [Muharremi] Another question comes from a viewer from  Switzerland, who poses this question. Of course, he has in mind  problems that have to do with Kosovar youths who are refugees in  Switzerland and the efforts to prolong the stay of the youths  there. This viewer asks: How do you foresee the solution to the  question of the youths after their return from Sweden?    [Rugova] This depends whether he is talking about the people  living there or not. Sweden has made efforts to return all our  citizens there, but it has run into obstacles on the part of  Serbia. We have asked that these youths be granted temporary  residence. Many European countries have agreed to grant this  status to these youths. In this situation, we can provide the  youths with some vacancies, find some positions in our present  system, such as in the university, the small private economy  that the Albanians have. And of course, under these grave  circumstances, we will leave no one to die of hunger.    [Muharremi] Another question....    [Rugova] Of course, if we think of tomorrow, that's another  question.    [Muharremi] Mr. President, another question for you is this:  What is your comment on the visit of an Albanian Socialist Party  leader to Greece?    [Rugova] It is true that parties and groups have the right  to establish contacts. However, it should of course be known,  direct information is needed, or a report by the state where the  political parties or various associations are acting, because we  often talk about the national question, but the national  question is very concrete. We have a consensus, an Albanian  global policy. That is why it would be better if all parties  and groups were to remain loyal to this consensus, not to put it  in stronger words, to be loyal to an official policy. However,  contacts with good intentions, without inferiority, are  important and should be developed.    [Muharremi] Mr. President, another question comes from  Tirana: What are your relations as president with the  intellectual Rexhep Qosja?    [Rugova] They are very good. As you know, Rexhep Qosja is  one of our renowned intellectuals. He has not entered any  political organizations or parties. He is the leader of the  Forum of Albanian Intellectuals. He has contributed with his  writings and presentations and there are no misunderstandings or  disagreement. He performs his job, and of course; I, as  president, carry out my job, too.    [Muharremi] Mr. President, another question seems to be  related to Belgrade preparations to appoint a new ambassador in  Tirana. It looks as if it is going to be Zivorad Igic. The  question is: What is president Rugova's opinion about the  appointment of this Belgrade ambassador in Tirana?    [Rugova] I heard recently that he will be appointed here as  ambassador. As you know, for years he has been the chief of the  Socialist Party for Kosova, as there is not one of Kosova, but  for Kosova. Unfortunately, he has largely contributed to the  repressive situation prevailing in Kosova now. I think that  this option should be reconsidered, whether Belgrade has decided  to send him or not. Of course, Kosova has its own representation  in Tirana and other countries. However, such people do not  deserve to represent anyone.    [Muharremi] Our pan-Albanian public has continuously shown  interest in the contribution and role of Kosovar intellectuals  in the present processes in Kosova. Precisely that is the  content of another question addressed to you.    [Rugova] To tell the truth, Kosovar intellectuals have shown  great commitment and, with the foundation of our parallel  institutions and political parties, many of them have become  members of political parties, elected deputies of the Kosova  Assembly, members of various associations and the university.  Their role is very great, of course including here the youngest  intellectuals, as they keep the university and various  institutions going. Under this grave and difficult situation,  they, nevertheless, contribute a lot.    [Muharremi] Mr. President, the next question comes from  Germany. Islam Kamberi puts this question to you: When is the  Kosova parliament expected to convene?    [Rugova] We have so far postponed the meeting of the  parliament, so as not to provoke any conflict. We can hold this  meeting, I am not giving any time here, but we should be  careful. It is important that parliamentarians are in Kosova,  elections have been held, and several parliamentary groups are  working. Some commissions of the parliament have started to  work on the basis of the present situation. As you know, under  such conditions, a parliament finds it difficult to conduct  normal activity. Anyway, we will see our way to performing this  job. However, a part of the parliament is working and  functioning.    [Muharremi] A question from Zurich, Mr. President. Now,  this question has to do with the present situation of the  political parties and the Albanians in Macedonia. How do you see  this situation developing?    [Rugova] You know what happened with the Party for  Democratic Prosperity [PDP] there. I think that there is now a  kind of lull and we should make efforts so that all parties can  consolidate, be they large or small. However, a means of  cooperation, a council, or something should be found for the  PDP, as they should definitely be more individual. In the case  of the present census, all the Albanian forces there should be  organized. Elections in Macedonia will be held in the future,  too. That is why we should make common efforts to consolidate  the political organization of the Albanians there.    [Muharremi] Mr. President, recently as well as before,  Serbia has concocted several trumped-up political trials in  various main cities in Kosova. With these trials, Serbia  attempts to accuse the Albanians of Kosova that they are being  prepared for terrorism, to bear arms, up to the point of  charging them with being trained in special camps in Albania,  and so forth. Are these activities of the present Serbian policy  an aggravation and an escalation of the violence and terror  against the Albanians in Kosova, as well as an attempt to  attribute to the personalities and the political leadership of  the Albanians in Kosova the role of a destructive force, and not  of a force that aspires for dialogue and agrees to discuss at  the table of bilateral negotiations?    [Rugova] To tell the truth, this is an old song being sung  to us. Thus, always with charges against Albanians, they have  created that myth on the armed Albanians, and so forth. For a  year now, as you know, there has been widespread imprisonment of  various groups and the majority have been convicted from one to  15 years of jail. These are simply trumped-up political trials  to discredit our present policy, weaken the political position  of the Kosova leadership, and of course, increase the degree of  violence and repression. This is their main aim. As you know,  no weapons or anything else have been found on those people who  were imprisoned. They have taken people from their homes.  Anyway, these are all fabrications so as to intensify the  violence and repression and politically discredit the Albanian  policy and leadership in general.    [Muharremi] Mr. President, we mentioned before....    [Rugova] When Germany wanted to repatriate refugees, the  Serbs said that they were trained there and they continued  training. These are fabrications aimed at discrediting the  Albanian policy.    [Muharremi] Mr. President, I would like to pick out a part  of the interview that German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel gave  to the ZERI newspaper. Mr. Kinkel stresses that the Serbs  cannot refuse to the Albanians of Kosova what they request  themselves for the Serbian communities in Bosnia, Herzegovina,  and Croatia. How do you assess this statement from the chief of  the German diplomacy?    [Rugova] This is an interesting opinion. However, as you  know the Serbs and their regime have always acted with double  standards. In Bosnia and Croatia they have requested their  ethnic rights, as they have people there. Then they brought  this about through violence and force. Meanwhile, the Serb  regime refuses the Albanians the right to self-determination,  the right of independence. Regarding Kosova, they always call  upon a certain historic right, which no longer holds water in  the modern, contemporary world. Of course, much would depend on  the solutions in Bosnia.    [Muharremi] Mr. President, the next question comes from  Germany from Nazif Bilalli. He addresses this question to you:  Do you assess as positive the last visit of the delegation of  the Republic of Montenegro in Tirana?    [Rugova] These are normal contacts that Albania maintains  and will maintain with neighboring countries. As you know, last  year the president of Montenegro paid a visit, then the foreign  minister, and now the prime minister. These are positive steps  of contacts, recognition, and cooperation. Thus, nothing bad  comes out of these contacts. It is known that Albania has its  own positions and policy and should cooperate with the others.    [Muharremi] Mr. President, in continuation of our  conversation, regarding your visit to Denmark, the Danish  newspaper DETFRI ACTUELLE cites you stating that "President  Rugova declared: We have asked that the question of Kosova be  treated in the framework of the global examination of problems  in former Yugoslavia." What is the stance of the European  diplomatic circles regarding this fair demand of yours?    [Rugova] Besides what I said and we discussed at the  beginning, we have always requested that the question of Kosova  be put forward in the global solution to former Yugoslavia, so  that Kosova would be a direct representative in any possible  conference that will be held. Then comes the question of  sanctions, and I can say that there is understanding and  promises that Kosova will anyway be included as a partner in  possible talks on the global solutions for former Yugoslavia. I  can affirm that there exist such a disposition not only in the  countries we visited, but in other countries as well.    [Muharremi] Mr. President, in a conversation such as this,  it is routine to ask you about the activity carried out by the  government of Kosova. Of course, it is known that the Kosova  government is regularly active in educational and health  matters, in economic organization, as well as in slowly creating  state structures. How do you assess this activity bearing in  mind that it has to work under all these extremely difficult  conditions?    [Rugova] They pertain to our entire organization and the  government, that is, the part that is abroad and that at home,  and to political parties, as we are in a situation in which our  organs are functioning in Kosova under difficult conditions.  For example, I can mention here the Democratic Alliance, which  has a very good organization, various associations, other  parties, institutions or local governments that we have, which  are being strengthened every day. We can also point out the  creation of several economic institutions, such as the Chamber  of Commerce set up some time ago, then the organization of the  economic and everyday life in Kosova.    [Muharremi] Mr. President, there is a question from Sweden  from Haxhi Osmanaj. In this framework, he would like to ask you  for a certain assessment of the mass media. He says: How does  president Rugova assess the work of the RILINDJA newspaper?    [Rugova] RILINDJA is for the moment published in Tirana and  Switzerland. There is a RILINDJA in Kosova, as well as BUJKU.  We assess this very positively and RILINDJA has contributed a  lot in informing the public at home and abroad. It is a serious  newspaper and has contributed a lot. Its publication in  Switzerland was an important step in keeping RILINDJA alive and  preventing it from being extinguished. At the same time, it  informed our public and people abroad that stability in  information and in the information culture is being created in  the West.    [Muharremi] Mr. President, Kadri Berisha from Switzerland  asks you: What contacts does president Rugova have with Mr.  Adem Demaci?    [Rugova] We have good contacts. As you know, Mr. Demaci is  chairman of the Human Rights Council in Kosova, a very important  association that is performing a great job. Then, the authority  of Mr. Demaci helps us all, particularly his work during the  recent years in Kosova. I can say he is not only a symbol of  resistance, but he works and is in the framework of our  resistance.    [Muharremi] Let us come to a question I addressed to you  before through a viewer regarding the movements of young  Kosovars from Kosova. This viewer from Germany asks: Is this  movement, this departure of the youth from Kosova, proper?    [Rugova] It is not that we are trying to find arguments, but  we should understand this on the basis of the entire situation  in the former Yugoslavia. You know what happened with the  refugees from the war front in Bosnia and Croatia. Then from  the front of violence present in Kosova, which started first in  1981, and particularly in 1989-90, young people have left,  particularly for refusing to join the Serbian military service,  deserters starting from Slovenia up to Bosnia. Regarding this  exodus, the situation is such that we have requested their  temporary asylum and have been trying to help them as much as we  can. Meanwhile, I can say that recently there has been less  movement, because many European countries have established their  system of visas and various actions. However, on the basis of  the present situation, this is important as people are alive and  they will move and come back.    [Muharremi] Mr. President, another question comes from  Ejup Gashi in Norway. He asks you: How does president Rugova  assess the Norwegian foreign policy on the option of a peaceful  solution in Kosova?    [Rugova] Very positively. We have had contacts with Norway  before. Like all other Scandinavian countries, this has always  been the case in Kosova. We have had contacts with various  delegations, associations, and the government. Even this time,  we reached a very good understanding on the question of Kosova  and its solution. We also consider the assistance that Norway  is granting us through various aid and with the temporary  shelter of our refugees, who were settled in many places there  and have began to be integrated, in the positive sense, until  possibilities are created in Kosovo.    [Muharremi] Mr. President, another question for you: A  television viewer from Korce asks: Do you see the fight of the  Albanian people in Kosova as a peaceful passive resistance or as  a peaceful active stand?    [Rugova] To be frank, this is not as completely passive as  is thought, because the people there are sacrificing their work  and their lives. As you know, all this violence and repression  goes as far as murder. That is why this is an active resistance  and a resistance praised by the world. If other demonstrations  may be called active resistance, we have also tried them several  times, as you know. However, there is great danger as the large  troop presence there presents a potential threat, because things  may take another direction, which we would not want.    [Muharremi] Mr. President, a student from Tirana wants to  know your opinion: Is it possible that the question of Kosova  can be won through diplomatic contacts alone?    [Rugova] This cannot be done through diplomatic contacts,  because as you know, there has been... Of course, we are a  state and we have a policy. There are criticisms, opinions, and  different viewpoints. The diplomatic contacts are necessary and  important. We are on the road to success through the  organization we have established in Kosova, through the  resistance of the people, because the people are not asleep  there, as sometimes may be thought in a simplistic way.  However, we, and Albania too, should strengthen contacts and  friendships. As I said before, the contacts that Albania,  President Berisha, and the government have established today, as  well as those of Kosova, are very important; as the saying of  our people goes: A house cannot be kept without friends. Then  there are international factors that have often supported us.  That is why we should be ready and cooperate with them.    [Muharremi] Mr. President, a viewer from Shkoder comes back  to the idea of dialogue. He asks: Do the conditions and  possibilities exist for the development and start of an  unconditioned dialogue between the two sides at the present  moment?    [Rugova] To tell the truth, we have not set many conditions,  because you know that such a dialogue would be unequal given the  violence and total insecurity in Kosova. However, we should  talk and, I repeat again, there have been no official  indications of talks so far, but, anyway, we should talk.    [Muharremi] Mr. President, a viewer from Switzerland has  posed this question: Which international factors, so to say,  are supporting and assisting the solution to the Kosova issue?    [Rugova] Now, how to consider what these international  factors are? There are special places and factors -- such as  the international community, the European Union, the United  States -- that have reached understanding and address and assist  the question of Kosova. This is the international factor and,  of course, depends... as well as certain countries that we have  mentioned during our talk that assist the question of Kosova.    [Muharremi] Mr. President, Hysni Sopaj from Split asks:  Does president Rugova foresee paying a working visit to Croatia  and Slovenia to discuss the position of Albanians in these two  countries?    [Rugova] I went to Slovenia some time ago. Now we will see  with Croatia, as we have better relations, more or less. As you  know, Albania has made contact with these two countries and has  established good relations. This helps, but we will do our  utmost in Kosova to organize a visit to Croatia soon. The  predisposition exists, but you know the difficulty of these  contacts, which were interrupted a year ago.    [Muharremi] A viewer from Switzerland wants to know your  opinion: How does president Rugova comment on the threats of  Arkan [Zeljko Raznjatovic, leader of the Serb Unity Party, SSJ;  head of the Serbian Volunteer Guards, SDG] and Seselj [Vojislav  Seselj, president of the Serbian Renewal Movement, SPO]  regarding the eviction of Albanians from their ancient  territories in Kosova?    [Rugova] These are continuous threats. We have become used  to them. However, their ill-omened dream of evicting Albanians,  suspending political parties, and exterminating Albanian leaders  will not come true. In short, their dreams and demands will not  be realized. As you know, this is a bad myth that has been  inherited over several years or decades.    [Muharremi] Mr. President, another television viewer, this  time from Tirana, wants to know whether all the political  factors in Kosova are in accord with president Rugova's stances  or not?    [Rugova] All the political factors are of the same opinion.  As you know, we have five parties in the parliament of Kosova,  as well as the Coordinating Council of the Albanian Political  Parties. We have reached consensus on the independence of Kosova  on the basis of a referendum, the people's will, and of course,  the demands put forward in our political project on the  situation and organization in Kosova. Of course, the president  consults these parties and is obliged, even by the Constitution,  to listen to the parties, groups, parliament, and so forth.    [Muharremi] Mr. President, Nazmi Ramadani from Berlin has  posed this question: Will our Berlin Wall be removed without  war, as was the original wall in Berlin?    [Rugova] I hope yes and, not to answer so shortly, I can say  we are working on it, the Albanian people in general are working.    [Muharremi] Ferit Ejupi from Switzerland asks: Why does a  part of the government of the republic of Kosova act in Kosova  while the other part acts outside Kosova?    [Rugova] In short, it is because of the current conditions.  In 1991, when we founded this provisional coalition government,  it was necessary for some government members to go abroad as  they may have been arrested and their activity suspended. As  you know, before this government, we had another government that  emerged from the other parliament. We have also accepted the  legitimacy of that government, while this is a coalition  government. There is nothing bad here if opinions are  expressed, whether it should be in Kosova, or wherever.  However, we should be prudent regarding this.    After the 1992 elections, the situation changed. The  president is in Kosova, as well as a part of the government. It  is important that they function where, and how, we can see it.    [Muharremi] Mr. President, we have another question from  Germany, which, I think, is seemingly related with the statement  of Douglas Hogg in Prishtina. The viewer has posed this  question: What is president Rugova's opinion on Bosnia's  division and the problem of Kosova, as part of the former  Yugoslav Federation?    [Rugova] Now, regarding the question of Bosnia, this has  been accepted as a state, but the situation in the field has  urged immediate efforts, such as the ethnic division, and so  forth. This situation will depend a lot on the efforts to create  a Muslim-Croat federation, headed by a confederation or  something else. The Serbian side is abstaining from this.    Regarding the question of Kosova, it is known that we are  committed to its independence and neutrality. We have also said  that all the Albanian political parties in Kosova have reached  consensus, and if there are changes to the internal borders of  the former Yugoslavia, they will naturally be valid for the  Albanians, too.    [Muharremi] Mr. President, another question comes from  Switzerland: Do you think that the discriminating policy  against the Albanians in Macedonia will change?    [Rugova] To tell the truth, the Albanians there have  contributed a lot to the stability of that republic by being  members of the parliament, participating in the government, and  having a political organization. The Macedonian Government and  the other institutions should be more active in fulfilling the  demands of the Albanians, incorporating their institutions,  schools, and faculties, and following a more active policy. I  hope that this policy will be more active in the future and, of  course, the Albanians will be better organized on the political,  administrative, and judicial levels in Macedonia, because there  is the potential, but we should be ready to find agreement and  understanding.    [Muharremi] Mr. President, it seems from the telephone calls  that there are many questions from the television viewers.  Anyway, because of the limited time, of course, I would like to  ask you two more questions before closing our live conversation  on our satellite program.    Several months ago, the television started satellite  broadcasting. Considering the contacts you have had and your  assessments of the pan-Albanian general opinion, is the value of  this satellite program appreciated properly -- not only in the  sense of moral support, but also regarding the material and  financial support to continue this program and particularly to  expand it, so that this program reaches new dimensions of  pan-national importance?    [Rugova] To tell the truth, several months ago, when we  talked together, it was the start of this program, which is  something very important and a great achievement. Of course, we  should now make all possible efforts, with a better organization  of the diaspora and with our people, be it with the government,  the Democratic Alliance -- which is very well organized abroad  -- with clubs, and with various associations, so that the launch  of this television is assisted, because without such a studio  today, our people, our nation would be more divided. We should  do our utmost to keep it. I am not making any appeal to our  citizens abroad, but we should work to realize this and keep  this studio. And God willing, tomorrow we will have more.  Anyway, we should be organized and carry out these obligations  and duties, because we need it, above all, as it is in Albanian.    [Muharremi] Mr. President, the last question, in closing  this conversation. As is known, we are on the eve of  celebrating the 70th anniversary of the June democratic  revolution. Do you see parallels today with this important event  in our national history?    [Rugova] I stayed here for these days in order to be present  at this great, important celebration of our renowned figure, Fan  Noli, who, throughout his life, worked in politics and fought  for the realization of the national rights of Albanians. I can  say that a parallel can be drawn regarding the democratic ideas  and the democratic progress. Albanians today are different from  the Albanians of the Twenties, fortunately, and it is easier to  accomplish the mechanism of democracy and the national  interests. Once again I want to show my great respect and great  thanks to our great Noli, as they say. At the same time, this  is a good opportunity for Albania to celebrate this important  moment.    [Muharremi] Mr. President....    [Rugova] And we should continue this.    [Muharremi] In closing, I want to thank you for this very  friendly conversation, hoping that through this talk we provided  the pan-national broad public with ample information on the main  problems that worry us today. I would also like to send thanks  to all the television viewers who watched our broadcast and  greetings from the staff of the Radio Television and the  Satellite Program, hoping that you will come to our studio  again. Thank you once again.    [Rugova] Thank you. Warm greetings to all. You are welcome  to come to Prishtina soon.</p>

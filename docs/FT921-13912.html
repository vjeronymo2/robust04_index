			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: Sunday shopping may lift Budgens - The Week Ahead ALL eyes this week will be on the results of Lonrho on Thursday. Shares in the conglomerate, which has wide ranging agricultural, manufacturing and leisure interests, have dropped from 230p in late November to 150p last night. Concern centres around the 'tycoon factor' - the future of Tiny Rowland, the company's driving force. (See story on Page II). Interim results from Budgens on Tuesday will be the first news on how things are progressing at the the food retailer, where institutional investors installed a new management team last April. Analysts are expecting pre-tax profits of about Pounds 1m, and will be interested to hear how Sunday trading is holding up, now that other food retailers have clambered aboard the bandwagon which Budgens was one of the first to get rolling. Newman Tonks, Europe's largest maker of architectural hardware, will report on Wednesday a steep drop in pre-tax profits for the year ended October. They are likely to fall to around Pounds 15m from Pounds 23.2m a year earlier. The decline is no surprise given the abysmal UK housing market. However, its strength abroad, coupled with tight management, will have helped minimise the blow. Analysts are pencilling in a slight pick up for the present year.</p>

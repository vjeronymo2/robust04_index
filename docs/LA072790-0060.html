			<p><P> July 27, 1990, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> RED CROSS VOWS CLOSER SCRUTINY ON BLOOD BANKS  </P> <P> The American Red Cross announced Thursday that it will take corrective steps in  response to a government report that found laxity in the tracking by blood  banks of transfusion-associated AIDS and other diseases.  </P> <P> In a 60-page letter sent to the Food and Drug Administration, the Red Cross  outlined how it would improve its methods for receiving, investigating and  following up on reports of errors and accidents that come in from its 54  blood-collecting regions.  </P> <P> Earlier this month, a preliminary report by an FDA inspector found that the  government had never been notified of 228 reports of transfusion-associated  AIDS reported to the Washington, D.C., region of the Red Cross.  </P> <P> "A preliminary review of these cases has determined that almost all of the  transfusions occurred before March, 1985, when the testing for the AIDS virus  began. From the preliminary review, it also appears that these cases did not  result from any erroneous release of blood products," the Red Cross said in a  statement.  </P> <P> The AIDS-causing human immuno-deficiency virus, or HIV, is spread by sexual or  blood-to-blood contact, such as receiving a blood transfusion from another  person.  </P></p>

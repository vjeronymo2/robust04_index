"It hit the ground, flipped and caught  fire."  </P> <P> The plane took off from Buchanan Field at 11:21 a.m. and crashed on Orion Road  near Burnett Avenue and Galaxy Way.  </P> <P> "All I saw was black smoke and flames," said Yvonne Wilbraham, who works in the  nearby Galaxy Building. "People in our office heard a loud noise, looked up and  saw a plane. It's scary. The airport's right in our back yard."  </P> <P> In December, 1985, a small plane coming in for a landing at Buchanan Field  crashed into the roof of nearby Sun Valley Mall, killing seven Christmas  shoppers.  </P></p>

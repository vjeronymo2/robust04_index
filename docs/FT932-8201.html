			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / World Trade News: Clinton's Dollars 7bn dilemma on China - Linking human rights to trade could backfire DEMOCRATS in the US Congress used to enjoy watching former President George Bush squirm during his annual veto of legislation which linked US tariff levels on Chinese imports with the country's human rights behaviour. Now it is President Bill Clinton's turn to feel the heat. As a candidate he indicated support for the Democrats in Congress. As president he must worry that even conditional China trade linkage, under which the administration is required to certify annually that China has improved its human rights and arms sales record, would jeopardise up to Dollars 7.5bn (Pounds 4.9bn) in US exports this year. This policy of non-discrimination in trade policy, the Most Favoured Nation treatment, provides to all trading partners the same customs and tariff arrangements. The president has until June 3 to notify Congress whether he will renew China's MFN status. He could at the same time unilaterally impose some conditions on next year's renewal to head off legislation in Congress to impose even steeper requirements. Mr Warren Christopher, secretary of state, said China's reportedly coercive family planning programme and its alleged missile sales to Pakistan could be cited as a necessary improvement. In the business community, the overwhelming sentiment is that morality is a luxury the US can rarely indulge in these days of persistently high unemployment - particularly when the price of linking US tariff rates with China's human rights record gets higher every year. The voluntary Levi Strauss withdrawal from China is not seen as the beginning of a trend. In fact, a new report by the International Business and Economic Research Corporation, which is funded by business, frets that removal of MFN or conditionality would provoke Chinese retaliation and risk up to 171,000 US jobs in 1993. Hardest hit immediately would be US exports of aircraft, fertiliser, wheat and telecommunications. In the report's worst case scenario Boeing, McDonnell Douglas and their suppliers would suffer the greatest harm. They have 76 per cent of China's aerospace market. Boeing could lose Dollars 5bn in sales. McDonnell Douglas has been selected for co-production of a 'trunk aircraft' which calls for firm orders for 40 aircraft, valued at about Dollars 1bn, and it is discussing assembly of 105-seater aircraft in Shanghai. China is the largest market for US fertiliser - exports last year were Dollars 629m - and it is usually the largest or second largest importer of US wheat. Billions of dollars will be at stake as China modernises its telecommunications market, where AT&amp;T is already a leading participant. Former senator Adlai Stevenson, an Illinois Democrat and son of the country's late United Nation's ambassador, is one of many in business hoping conditional MFN can be avoided. As head of a US-Chinese joint venture to design, build and operate commercial telecommunications systems in China, Mr Stevenson is all too aware of what is at risk. The joint venture - the China America Telecommunication Company - has a contract to build a Dollars 20m prototype. US sanctions ultimately could cost the group participation in China's Dollars 20bn telecommunications equipment market. Yet projects like these which link the Chinese people with the outside world are important to improvement of human rights, Mr Stevenson argues. 'Political liberalisation is happening already, although it is hard to quantify, and it will continue to happen as ideas and information cross borders.' US investment in China has been limited until recently to production ventures. But investment has expanded in services, with US accounting, computer software, consulting, financial insurance and marketing firms establishing a toehold from which the newcomers are expecting to leap into the China market. Since August 1992 the following investments are among the dozens which have been announced: American International Group, forming a wholly-owned insurance company in Shanghai; Connor Peripherals to manufacture hard disk drives; Coopers &amp; Lybrand, a joint venture to provide auditing, accounting, tax and consulting services; Gallup Group, a joint venture to conduct market research; General Electric, with Chinese partners and others to build a communications satellite; Singer, construction of a sewing machine company with annual production of 400,000 units; and Westinghouse Electronics and Digital Equipment, an agreement with Shanghai No 1 Iron and Steel Plant to develop automation techniques. MFN legislation, introduced by the Senate majority leader George Mitchell, would differentiate between products produced by private enterprises (now about half US imports from China) and those made in state ventures, which would be subject to the same high tariffs as Afghanistan, Cambodia, Cuba, Laos, Montenegro, North Korea, Serbia and Vietnam. Under the legislation, China would be required to step up releases of political prisoners and improve its record on religious persecutions, unfair trade practices, and exports of missiles and other arms exports to regimes that have not signed up to multilateral controls. The Dollars 17bn US trade deficit with China is less of an issue in the MFN debate this year. Congressman Lee Hamilton, chairman of the House foreign affairs committee, recently acknowledged that 'fair minded people recognise that increased imports from China reflect the relocation of production from other Asian exporters, including Taiwan and Hong Kong'. Furthermore, China's imports are likely to mushroom to supply a growing demand for raw materials, capital equipment and technology. Mr Winston Lord, the assistant US secretary of state, last week apparently made little headway in urging China to make new commitments on human rights and weapons proliferation. The administration is expected to wait as long as possible before the June 3 deadline, in the hope that the pressure will produce Chinese concessions.</p>

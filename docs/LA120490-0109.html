			<p><P> December 4, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FLOAT BRINGS CALL FOR AUDIT OF RIDE-SHARING PROGRAM  </P> <P> Following disclosures that $100,000 is being invested in a parade float to  promote ride-sharing, transportation officials ordered an internal audit Monday  of the entire ride-sharing program to see if there were any more questionable  expenditures.  </P> <P> Jim Drago, a spokesman for the California Department of Transportation,  confirmed that the audit of the $8.4-million program was requested by J. F.  Maloney, the agency's chief deputy director, to determine "if all the money is  being spent properly."  </P> <P> "Any time the merits of any program are questioned, as a matter of routine we  would go back and look at it," he said. "We want to know if the money is being  spent as intended to promote ride-sharing."  </P> <P> Caltrans has been criticized by several legislators, including the chairmen of  both the Senate and Assembly transportation committees, for a decision to spend  $100,000 on a float for the Tournament of Roses Parade. The float, depicting  magical characters, encourages motorists to do their part to help unclog  highways by sharing rides.  </P> <P> Drago said the state would continue with the float project.  </P> <P> Caltrans' $100,000 investment covers half the cost of the float. The rest is  being met by other government agencies and private companies.  </P> <P> Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) called the $100,000 expenditure "ill-timed"  because he said it gave the impression that Caltrans did not know how to spend  additional gas tax money approved by the voters in June. By approving  Proposition 111, voters endorsed a phased-in, 9-cents per gallon gasoline tax  increase.  </P> <P> "On Dec. 1, fuel taxes (increased) another 5 cents per gallon nationally, and  on Jan. 1, 1991, the state fuel tax rate will increase another penny a gallon,"  Katz wrote to Caltrans. "The first and most visible use of those new revenues  will be a parade float. That's not what the voters expected when they approved  Proposition 111."  </P></p>

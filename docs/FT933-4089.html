			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / Test for Bank and examiners: The appeal against closure of Mount Banking THE BANK of England faces one of the first real external tests of its credibility as a regulator this week as a panel of three sits to assess whether it was right almost a year ago to recommend closure of Mount Banking. The workings of the banking appeals tribunal - the panel before which the Bank is appearing - are also being tested for the first time. No other tribunal has been constituted in the six years since the legal provisions for them were introduced. The Bank of England faces an appeal brought by Mr Navinchandra Bhagwanji Shah and Mr Suresh Bhagwanji Shah, the shareholders in Mount Banking, a small bank based in the UK. Most of Mount's depositors were Asians. Accountants at KPMG Peat Marwick who are the administrators to the bank are also involved in the appeal. The Shahs object to the petition brought by the Bank in early October last year to place Mount in provisional liquidation. This was granted, and Mount entered administration two weeks later. Creditors last month approved a voluntary arrangement which leaves open several options for Mount's future. The procedure for a banking appeals tribunal was established in the 1987 Banking Act, with the details laid out in a statutory instrument which became effective in that year. Although seven cases have gone as far as a preliminary hearing, none has yet reached the stage of a full appeal. 'It is an ad hoc body,' an official familiar with the tribunal said yesterday. 'It is so long since the previous one (appeal) that we are almost re-inventing the wheel.' Control for administering appeals has been shifted since 1987 from the Treasury to the Lord Chancellor's Department, where it is co-ordinated by the secretariat responsible for value added tax and inland revenue appeals. The same staff would also handle appeal procedures laid down in legislation for building societies and friendly societies, though no such action has ever been launched in either case. When any banking appeal is received, the lord chancellor nominates a chairman and the chancellor of the exchequer puts forward two 'wing' members  -so called because they sit on either side of the chairman. The chairman holds a preliminary hearing and if there is a case to answer and those involved wish to continue, a tribunal is held. Lawyers may represent all those called and the verdicts and identities have normally been kept secret. In 1989-90 there were three initial appeals which were either withdrawn or settled without recourse to the full tribunal. One of the cases is believed to have concerned Harrods Bank. In the past year there have been a further three appeals. One was settled by agreement, one was withdrawn and a decision about whether to proceed to a full appeal on the third is still pending. In addition, there is the Mount case, for which the chairman is Mr Jonathan Mance QC. The wing members are Mr Christopher Swinson, an accountant, and Mr Nicholas Clegg, a banker. The hearings started on Monday and may run into next week. The Bank of England rejects suggestions that the tribunal reflects a greater willingness to have its authority as a supervisor tested - an approach recommended in the Bingham report following the collapse of Bank of Credit and Commerce International. Others suggest that the fact a tribunal is taking place is more a function of the tenaciousness of the Shahs and their insistence in pursuing the formal procedures as far as possible.</p>

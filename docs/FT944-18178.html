			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / Senate confirms nominee for FDIC President Bill Clinton won a small victory yesterday, after weeks of deadlock with Congress on different issues, when the Senate finally voted to confirm his nominee to head the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, writes George Graham in Washington. The FDIC has been without a chairman since the death of Mr William Taylor two years ago. The nomination of Ms Ricki Tigert, a Washington lawyer and former Federal Reserve official, had been held up for 11 months by the objections of Senator Lauch Faircloth of North Carolina. Seven Republicans joined 56 Democrats in the Senate to give the 60 vote majority needed to override Senator Faircloth's filibuster attempt. In a second vote on the nomination, the Senate confirmed Ms Tigert by 90 to 7. Mr Faircloth and Senator Alphonse d'Amato had criticised Ms Tigert for being too closely tied to Mr and Mrs Clinton, and had already compelled her to promise to step aside from any FDIC involvement in the Whitewater investigation. This involves the Clintons' investment in an Arkansas property venture and its links to a federally insured savings institution. Democratic supporters of Ms Tigert said she was merely a Clinton acquaintance.</p>

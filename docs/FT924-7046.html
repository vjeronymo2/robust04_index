			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / International Company News: Santos drops its bid for Sagasco SANTOS, the Australian energy group, yesterday dropped a ADollars 560m (USDollars 386m) hostile bid for Sagasco Holdings after legal action against the bid by the Trades Practices Commission (TPC), the federal competition watchdog. But Santos said it would try to acquire 19.9 per cent of Sagasco, on the market since the South Australian state government decided earlier this year to sell its 57 per cent holding. Santos said its decision to drop the bid was prompted by uncertainty over the outcome of the TPC action, which is expected to be heard in the Federal Court in March. The group also said it was concerned about uncertainty surrounding a rival ADollars 122m bid by Sagasco for Magellan Petroleum Australia, launched shortly after the announcement of the Santos offer for Sagasco. The Queensland Court of Appeal has prevented the mailing of takeover documents from Sagasco to Magellan shareholders pending a trial of objections filed by Magellan. Santos said it would oppose an application by the TPC for a permanent injunction against the offer, suggesting that it remains a potential bidder for control of Sagasco in the long term. 'Santos has senior counsel's advice that it has a strong case and that the TPC is unlikely to succeed at trial,' the company said. The TPC claims the takeover would give Santos control over gas supplies on the Australian mainland. Santos shares closed two cents higher on the Australian Stock Exchange at ADollars 2.37.</p>

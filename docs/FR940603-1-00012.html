The amendment deletes reference to the Kentucky Advisory Committee for Abandoned land Reclamation and establishes informal procedures for coordination of activities with the Rural Abandoned Mine Program (RAMP) administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service (SCS). The amendment is intended to improve operational efficiency. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Written comments must be received on or before 4 p.m., E.D.T., on July 5, 1994.

Background on the Kentucky Plan <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Title IV of SMCRA established an AMLR program for the purposes of reclaiming and restoring lands and water resources adversely affected by past mining. This program is funded by a reclamation fee imposed upon the production of coal. As enacted in 1977, lands and waters eligible for reclamation were those that were mined or affected by mining and abandoned or left in an inadequate reclamation status prior to August 3, 1977, and for which there was no continuing reclamation responsibility under State or Federal law. The Abandoned Mine Land (AML) Reclamation Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;508, Title VI, Subtitle A, Nov. 5, 1990, effective October 1, 1991) amended SMCRA, 30 U.S.C. 1231  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ., to provide changes in the eligibility of project sites for AML expenditures. Title IV of SMCRA now provides for reclamation of certain mine sites where the mining occurred after August 3, 1977. These include interim program sites where bond forfeiture proceeds were insufficient for adequate reclamation and sites affected any time between August 4, 1977, and November 5, 1990, for which there were insufficient funds for adequate reclamation due to the insolvency of the bond surety. Title IV provides that a State with an approved AMLR program has the responsibility and primary authority to implement the program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On May 18, 1982, the Secretary of the Interior approved the Kentucky plan. Background information on the plan including the Secretary's findings, the disposition of comments and a detailed explanation of approval can be found in the May 18, 1982,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (47 FR 21435). Subsequent actions concerning the conditions of approval and amendments to the plan can be found at 30 CFR 917.21. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary adopted regulations at 30 CFR part 884 that specify the content requirements of a State reclamation plan and the criteria for plan approval. The regulations provide that a state may submit to the Director proposed amendments or revisions to the approved reclamation plan. If the amendments or revisions change the scope of major policies followed by the State in the conduct of its reclamation program, the Director must follow the procedures in 30 CFR 884.14 when approving or disapproving an amendment or revision. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Discussion of Proposed Amendment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> By letter dated May 5, 1994 (Administrative Record No. K&hyph;64), Kentucky submitted a proposed amendment to revise procedures for coordinating with the RAMP, Indian, and other reclamation programs contained in Chapter 5 of the Kentucky Plan. This amendment was initiated in part due to a finding by the Kentucky Auditor of Public Accounts in the Statewide Audit for the period ended June 30, 1992, that the Division of Abandoned lands (DAL) was not operating in compliance with the Kentucky Plan. Chapter 5 of the plan establishes a ``Kentucky Advisory Committee for Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation'' to facilitate coordination of program activities with the RAMP program administered by the SCS. The Auditor determined that the processes established for the Advisory Committee to coordinate with RAMP were not being followed. The Advisory Committee had proven difficult to assemble, was cumbersome in operation, and had been disbanded. The proposed AMLR program amendment describes new, more informal coordination procedures. The annual meeting of the Kentucky Advisory Committee is to be replaced with an informal annual meeting between DAL and SCS staffs. During the annual meeting, SCS will present overall RAMP plans and goals, including scheduled reclamation sites, and results of past reclamation with emphasis on experience with various reclamation techniques. DAL will provide the SCS with its project proposals through the Kentucky State Clearinghouse process. SCS will provide DAL with copies of RAMP documentation provided to OSM. Contacts between DAL and RAMP staff management will be initiated by either party on an as needed basis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Minister signals survival of education authorities A CLEAR signal that the government does not intend to announce the demise of elected local education authorities (LEAs) in next week's education white paper was given yesterday by Baroness Blatch, the schools minister. Instead, it seems that councils are to be allowed to survive as education authorities so long as they are responsive to local demands. However, the government still hopes to increase the number of schools opting out of local authority control, resulting in many authorities losing their direct managerial function. The abolition of LEAs is known to have been one of the options considered by the government, and councils will greet the news with relief. 'If they are to remain players, local authorities will need increasingly to recognise the position of schools and parents as consumers,' Baroness Blatch said at the Council of Local Education Authorities' conference in Blackpool. She singled out the new regime for inspecting schools as one in which local education authorities could play a constructive role. 'LEAs will be able to play a part if they are willing to meet the necessary standards of inspection,' she said. 'I expect many will do so. There is clear evidence that at least some authorities are recognising the imperatives of greater competition and are implementing changes to the way they deliver services.' She also highlighted the monitoring of assessment standards in primary schools. 'If LEAs are to retain this role, they will need to demonstrated that they are committed and competent.' Mr Jack Straw, the outgoing shadow education secretary, told the conference: 'If local education authorities did not exist, they would have to be reinvented, even if the model used was a far less accountable one.' Baroness Blatch implicitly rejected plans put forward by the teachers' pay review body last week for performance pay based on bonuses for staff in high-achieving schools. She said: 'Incentives should be there not only for the successful teacher, but also for the teacher who is striving to maintain standards in a school which overall is just ticking over or even failing.'</p>

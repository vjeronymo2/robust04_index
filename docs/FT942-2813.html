			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / Observer: Family business Has Sears group chairman Geoffrey Maitland Smith found a new hobby - furniture-making? Bargain hunters at his group's Selfridges store on Oxford Street have spotted a new line of tables and chairs carrying the Maitland Smith moniker. It is not Geoffrey who is the cabinet-maker, but brother Paul. He founded a Philippines-based company in the 1970s making copies of classic British furniture - aimed mainly at the American market - and sold it five years ago to US conglomerate Masco. It opened a concession in Selfridges in February, and, says Sears, is trading well - and not just to Americans.</p>

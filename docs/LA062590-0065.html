			<p><P> June 25, 1990, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> OLD-TIME FAIR TO RETURN TO HANSEN DAM AREA JULY 18  </P> <P> The San Fernando Valley Fair, complete with a midway and live entertainment,  will return for a second year to Hansen Dam Recreation Area, which fair  officials hope will someday become the event's permanent home.  </P> <P> The fair will run July 18-22 and will be "a celebration of old-time Americana,"  said Ted Naumann, a spokesman for the 51st District Agricultural Assn., the  state agency that runs the fair.  </P> <P> It will include arts and crafts booths, homemaking exhibits, children's rides,  a horse show, a hog-calling contest and a petting zoo. There will be 2,000  exhibits, including animals raised by local 4-H Clubs and Future Farmers of  America chapters. No alcoholic beverages will be sold.  </P> <P> A smaller, three-day version of the fair, without the popular carnival  attractions, was held at Hansen Dam's sports complex and outdoor theater area  last year after the event was ousted from its former home, Devonshire Downs in  Northridge.  </P> <P> The hastily organized event was moved to the site in the northeast San Fernando  Valley after a plan to hold the fair at Pierce College in Woodland Hills fell  through at the last minute because of homeowner protests. The smaller fair drew  about 30,000 visitors, down from 70,000 in 1988.  </P> <P> Although skeptical before the event, homeowners in the Hansen Dam area said  they had no complaints about the smaller fair and are now willing to support  fair expansion. As a result, fair officials now hope to make the site the  event's permanent home.  </P> <P> But delays by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which owns the dam property and  leases part of it to the Los Angeles Recreation and Parks Department, in  planning for development of the 1,540-acre flood-control basin as a recreation  area have kept any formal proposal to build permanent fair facilities there on  hold.  </P> <P> "Everyone recognizes that the eastern rim represents the last bastion of rural  lifestyle in the Valley," Naumann said. "The fair fits in there."  </P> <P> The idea is supported by homeowner groups. "Last year, we asked them not to  have a midway or live concerts and to make the fair smaller," said Phyllis  Hines, land use chairwoman of the Lake View Terrace Improvement Assn., which  represents some neighboring homeowners. "There were few problems then, so all  we asked this year is that they have no liquor, and they agreed.  </P> <P> "They've been very, very cooperative with us," she said. "We really hope it's  successful."  </P> <P> Hines and Lewis Snow, president of the Lake View Terrace Home Owners Assn.,  said the fair would be a good addition to the neighborhood.  </P> <P> Many northeast San Fernando Valley residents also want to see a lake restored  at the dam. The former 130-acre boating and swimming lake was closed in 1982  after two decades of heavy rains brought millions of tons of debris into the  basin.  </P> <P> Snow and Hines expressed impatience with the Corps of Engineers' delays in  issuing preliminary plans for the site. The plans are necessary before the  lake, or any other facilities such as fairgrounds, can be planned there.  </P> <P> "I have never been more frustrated in my career as an activist as I have been  with Hansen Dam," Snow said.  </P> <P> A corps spokeswoman said a draft plan for the recreation area -- primarily  viewed by the corps as a flood-control basin -- was scheduled to be issued in  May but has been delayed several months, mainly because of personnel changes.  </P> <P> When the plan is complete, the corps will conduct hearings on the plan at which  fair officials and the public will have a chance to argue for building the  fairgrounds.  </P> <P> "We can't even begin to design a proposed fairgrounds until we know where the  Army Corps will allow 'high-intensity' uses," Naumann told members of Snow's  homeowner group in May. Fair directors are "just as frustrated as you are," he  said.  </P> <P> Naumann said in an interview that the city parks department, which operates  recreational programs at the dam, favors locating the fairgrounds there. He  also said the agricultural district now has about $15 million -- to be matched  by the state -- which it can use to acquire or develop a permanent home.  </P> <P> The fair was evicted in 1988 after 14 years at Devonshire Downs to make room  for an expansion planned by Cal State Northridge, which owns the property.  </P> <P> What resulted in the move to Hansen Dam was a scaled-down, old-fashioned fair,  which pleased Hansen Dam's neighbors and many fair-goers.  </P> <P> "The surroundings made you feel you were in the country. You weren't looking at  condominiums and asphalt," said Steve Pietrolongo, an agriculture teacher at  Canoga Park High School who has several students entering animals in this  year's fair.  </P> <P> In the fair's 1990 exhibit entry guide, Sal Buccieri, president of the fair's  board of directors, promised that this year's event will protect "the wholesome  family experience."  </P> <P> Mel Simas, program coordinator for the fair, has scheduled covered wagon rides,  an exhibit by the Model A Clubs of America, a National Horseshoe Pitching Assn.  tournament, coloring contests for children, whistling contests and musical  washboard and saw-playing competitions. Also on the bill is a show of rats and  mice, featuring about 200 short-haired and curly-haired rodents that have been  bred as pets.  </P> <P> Community members have been invited to work at the fair's carnival games of  skill to raise money for their nonprofit organizations. And the Lake View  Terrace Improvement Assn., under Hines' direction, is planning a pavilion that  will showcase recycling and environmental concerns.  </P> <P> Entertainment will include the Parachute Express, a children's variety show; a  sock hop reunion featuring Tiny Tim, Bobby Day and other musicians of the past;  and concerts by country singer Johnny Rodriguez and a band called Michael Wolf  and the Posse.  </P> <P> Hours will be from noon to 10:30 p.m. July 18-20 and from 10 a.m. to 10:30 p.m.  July 21 and 22. Admission is $5 for ages 11 and older. Children 10 and younger  will be admitted free. Parking is $2 a car.  </P> <P> The fair is attempting "to re-establish a very carefully themed fair," Naumann  said. "We've learned not to try to be all things to all people.  </P> <P> Hines said that if fair officials continue to cooperate with the community, she  believes they will succeed.  </P> <P> "Last year, I took my 83-year-old father on opening day," she said. "But there  were no benches, and I had to take him home in a couple of hours. I called Ted  Naumann about the benches. The next day, there were benches all over the place.  That's the kind of cooperation we're getting."  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 6. Pursuant to the Rehab Plan, an interim benefit payment (the Interim Payment) was received by the Plans in the combined amount of $288,528 in September, 1993. In January, 1994, the Plans were provided an option to elect to participate in the Rehab Plan or to opt out. Notice was given that the contract values and terms of the original GIC had been adjusted down as required by the Rehab Plan. The Plans were advised that there was no participating state guaranty association, and thus no such source of makeup funds. The Plans' Committees elected to opt out of the Rehab Plan, and the GIC was surrendered (see rep. 8, below).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Under the Rehab Plan, a new insurance company, Aurora, was created to receive the ELIC assets. ELIC contractholders, however, were not forced to invest in the new company and could opt out. Upon opting out, however, the ELIC contractholders were to receive only a portion of their Accumulated Book Value, or a reduction of 31.5%. After that reduction, further amounts were to be held back to cover potential liabilities from ELIC indemnities in the sale of the assets and ongoing litigation concerning allocation of the ELIC assets, leaving the balance for the first opt out payment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to the first opt out payment, the Rehab Plan provides for future potential payments as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) distributions from enhancement trusts; and (b) release of holdbacks. These are described below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Three enhancement trusts were created at the ELIC sale to protect certain ELIC assets that were not part of the sale, one for real estate, one for below grade stocks and bonds, and one for ELIC rights not transferred. All of these assets are to be liquidated by the enhancement trusts over time and the proceeds distributed to the ELIC contractholders. As required by the Rehab Plan, a specified amount was held back to cover the indemnity and allocation contingencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The holdback amounts, if any remain, will be released to the participants in the future if not used to cover the indemnities and allocation litigation result. The Rehab Plan provided no assurance that there would be distributions from enhancement trusts or releases of holdbacks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. The opt out provision of the Rehab Plan was equivalent to a repurchase of the GIC in return for the opt out payment. Having elected to opt out, the Plans on March 27, 1994, received the first opt out payment in the amount of $730,912. When added to the Interim Payment (see rep. 6, above) of $288,528, the Plans have received a total of $1,019,440 from ELIC. In addition, approximately $200,000 was held back by ELIC (see rep. 7, above). When the opt out payment was received, the Plans surrendered the GIC to Aurora.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. Following the receipt of the first opt out payment and assuming no future payments from the enhancement trusts or from the holdback, each affected participant in the Plans will have lost approximately 42% of his/her account balance invested in the GIC as of the Conservation Date of April 11, 1991. The applicant represents that the realization of these losses and uncertainties surrounding the ELIC situation have caused substantial concern and anxiety among the Plans' participants. In order to relieve the affected participants' concerns, to protect the participants' accounts invested in the GIC, and to restore to the Plans the ability to fulfill obligations with respect to Withdrawal Events involving amounts invested in the GIC, Raytech desires to make up the losses the participants have suffered as a result of the investment in the GIC by way of the Makeup Payments. The Makeup Payments have been calculated as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <TABLE>  <!-- PJG tableformat 4,L2,tp0,i1,s150,11,11,11 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 --> &blank; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1&blank; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Hourly <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Salaried <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Total  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0152 intable -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=1 --> Accumulated Book Value on Conservation Date <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> $85,189 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> $1,689,590 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> $1,774,779  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Interest Values Lost (April 11, 1991 to March 27, 1994)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 23,332 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 463,167 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 486,499  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0162 intable --> n,s <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Totals <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 108,521 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 2,152,757 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 2,261,278  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0162 intable --> n,s <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=1 --> Payments Made By ELIC <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 49,598 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 969,842 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 1,019,440  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Makeup <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 58,923 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 1,182,915 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 1,241,838 <!-- PJG 007 0162 intable --> n,s  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Totals <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 108,521 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 2,152,757 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 2,261,278  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </TABLE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The totals that should have been earned match the payments made by ELIC (Interim Payment plus first opt out payment) plus the Makeup Payment. (The totals will increase to account for interest at 6.19% up to the actual Makeup Payment date.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Makeup Payments, which are shown in the above chart, have been calculated in order to restore to the Plans the full Accumulated Book Value of the GIC as of March 27, 1994 (the date of the first opt out payment), which is $2,261,278. In addition, the applicant represents that it will pay interest to the Plans up to the actual Makeup Payment date at a rate of 6.19%, since funds invested in the GIC would have been rolled over by the Trustee into the Hartford Insurance Company GIC, having a guaranteed interest rate of 6.19% and expiring December 31, 1997.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. Raytech is prepared and able to contribute the above-calculated Makeup Payments plus interest to the Plans to eliminate the participants' losses and future payment contingencies. The first opt out payments (including the Interim Payment) and the Raytech Makeup Payments will fully restore the participants' accounts. Immediately following the granting of the exemption proposed herein and the execution of a closing agreement with the Internal Revenue Service pursuant to Rev. Proc. 92&hyph;16, the Makeup Payment will be contributed directly to the Trustee, who is obligated under the terms of the Plans to invest the contribution directly into the Guaranteed Interest Fund. As future payments from the enhancement trusts or return of holdbacks are received, the Trustee is to pay such amounts over to Raytech to reimburse it for that portion of the Makeup Payments. The transaction can be characterized as a non-interest bearing loan by Raytech to the Plans requiring no security or collateralization.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11. The applicant represents that the losses suffered by the affected participants are known numbers since the Rehab Plan has been implemented and the payment has been made except for enhancement trusts and holdbacks. In the absence of the Makeup Payments, such participants stand to lose 42% of their account balances as of the Conservation Date of April 11, 1991 and interest since such date totaling approximately $1,242,000. To summarize, Raytech is proposing to make up the lost amounts and to cover the amounts not paid due to the enhancement trusts and the holdbacks under the Rehab Plan. Raytech is looking to recoup such amounts only to the extent that they are subsequently paid under the Rehab Plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

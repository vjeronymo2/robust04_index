			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / International Company News: NordLB buys into Berlin bank Norddeutsche Landesbank-Giro-zentrale will pay DM1bn (Dollars 645m) for a 10 per cent stake in Bankgesellschaft Berlin in one of the largest German banking deals in recent years. BGB yesterday confirmed that the state of Berlin will sell a 10 per cent holding - part of its 67.7 per cent controlling stake - to Hanover-based NordLB. The links arising from the deal will also allow BGB to expand its presence in northern and north eastern Germany. 'This is a strategic decision in which BGB will gain access to more retail banking in the north of Germany, while NordLB will gain important access to the German capital, particularly as this part of Germany begins to expand, and to our international markets,' BGB said. NordLB is one of Germany's largest public sector regional banks. Last year its operating profits, after risk provisions, totalled DM400.4m, a sharp rise over 1992, when operating profits totalled DM145.9m. The deal, which could be approved as early as September 22 when NordLB's supervisory board meets, coincides with a period of structural change in Berlin's banking establishment. BGB was created as a holding and investment banking company in January following the merger of three banking institutions - Berliner Bank, Landesbank Berlin, which owns the saving banks, and Berliner Hypotheken-und Pfandbriefbank, or Berlin Hyp, a property financing institution. The merger brought together for the first time in German banking the private and public sectors. Apart from Berlin's 67.7 per cent stake, 10 per cent is held by Gothaer Insurance Group and the remaining 22.3 per cent by minority shareholders. BGB's total equity capital is DM7.8bn and its assets total DM220bn. In its first interim results, it reported consolidated operating profits of DM734m. After taking into account risk provisions totalling DM326m, operating profits came out at DM408m. Bank officials said the state had no plans to relinquish its majority status. BGB may retain the right to buy back half of NordLB's 10 per cent stake.</p>

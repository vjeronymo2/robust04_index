			<p><P> November 19, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUTLER'S KICK MAKES UP FOR BEAR OF A MISS;  </P> <P> INTERCONFERENCE: AFTER BLOWING A FIELD-GOAL ATTEMPT AT THE END OF REGULATION,  HIS 44-YARDER IN OVERTIME BEATS BRONCOS.  </P> <P> To err is human. To forgive is possible for Chicago Bear Coach Mike Ditka, only  if you redeem yourself.  </P> <P> Ditka, who had a tantrum on the sideline when Kevin Butler's field-goal attempt  at the end of regulation bounced off the left upright, embraced his kicker  after Sunday's 16-13 overtime victory over the Denver Broncos.  </P> <P> Butler drilled a 44-yard field goal with 1:46 left in overtime to lift the  Bears (9-1) to their sixth consecutive victory.  </P> <P> "The first one (from 41 yards) missed by inches," Ditka said. "He's entitled."  </P> <P> The clincher was a low line-drive that managed to sail over the crossbar.  </P> <P> "It's a terrible feeling to miss a kick like that, but fortunately it hasn't  happened much to me in my career," Butler said. "It felt like I hit it good,  but it just started to hook at the end. Actually, the one in overtime felt  worse."  </P> <P> Butler's winning kick was made possible by poor field position endured by  Denver (3-7) on three possessions in overtime. Denver started drives at its 12,  eight and four-yard lines.  </P> <P> When the Broncos couldn't move out of the hole on their last series, Johnny  Bailey returned the punt 20 yards to the Denver 34, and Butler converted four  plays later.  </P> <P> "Maury Buford did an outstanding job of punting," Ditka said. "We kept them  pinned in there, and he gave us field position. As it turned out, the only  difference in the game was field position."  </P> <P> Denver Coach Dan Reeves agreed with Ditka.  </P> <P> "It seemed like we were in a hole going into overtime," he said. "We were  backed up constantly, and we couldn't make a play to get out of it.  </P> <P> "Another big difference in the game was the two turnovers. Chicago never turned  the ball over, they never made a mistake. That's the kind of team they are.  They're forcing you to beat them, and they're not helping you. This is the  thing that has plagued us, the mistakes, but I was proud of the way we played."  </P> <P> Denver got even, 13-13, with 1:14 left in regulation on John Elway's nine-yard  run.  </P> <P> A pair of field goals by David Treadwell gave Denver a 6-3 lead at the half.  But the Bears converted two turnovers into 10 third-quarter points to take a  13-6 advantage. It marked the ninth time in 10 games the Broncos have blown  halftime leads this season.  </P> <P> After Bobby Humphrey fumbled at the end of a 14-yard run on a vicious, head-on  hit by Chicago safety Mark Carrier, Mike Singletary recovered at the Denver  35-yard line. Butler's 32-yard field goal made it 6-6.  </P> <P> Two plays later, Jim Morrissey made a diving interception of Elway's pass at  the Denver 40. Seven plays later, Brad Muster ran 10 yards for a touchdown with  14 seconds left in the quarter.  </P></p>

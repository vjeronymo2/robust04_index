			<p><P> December 12, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CONTRACT BRIGHTENS CLOUDY NASSCO FUTURE;  </P> <P> SHIPBUILDING: LOOMING DEFENSE CUTS CONTINUE TO PLAGUE THE ONLY REMAINING  SHIPYARD ON THE WEST COAST.  </P> <P> A contract to build the third in a series of combat supply ships for the Navy  promises to pull San Diego-based National Steel &amp; Shipbuilding Co. out of  the red for the first time in two years, but impending defense cuts have put  the future of the recently restructured company in jeopardy, executives said  Monday.  </P> <P> Although the Navy so far has agreed to buy three of the high-speed fuel and  munitions supply ships, there are no guarantees that it will go forward with an  option to buy a fourth,said Fred Hallett, Nassco's chief financial officer.  </P> <P> "Without the (supply ships), we would not have a yard here in San Diego,"  Hallett said. "We have until 1993, (when the last of the three ships is  expected to be delivered to the Navy), but that obviously doesn't put us out of  the woods yet."  </P> <P> A management-led buyout in April saved the financially troubled company -- the  only remaining shipbuilding company on the West Coast -- from the fate of 44  other American shipyards forced to close during the past eight years. Putting  their personal assets up as collateral, a four-member management group found  funding to buy the shipyard from its former owner, Morrison-Knudsen of Boise,  Ida., which had planned to sink the shipyard after taking a record $30-million  loss in 1988.  </P> <P> The contract for the supply ships -- vessels that are designed to keep pace  with groups of combat ships at a 25-knot clip while carrying a maximum load of  150,000 barrels of fuel and 1,800 tons of munitions -- will keep the company  afloat by providing a steady source of revenue and jobs for about 3,100 people,  Hallett said.  </P> <P> Pieced together out of 100-ton steel blocks, each 754-foot-long ship takes  about three years to build. Each will be manned by a crew of 667.  </P> <P> The first of the three ships, known as AOE-6 (military shorthand for auxiliary  oiler explosives), awaits its maiden voyage from an inclined ways, or  framework, where it still must be outfitted with a hull, deck and house. Next  in line, AOE-7, lies in unassembled blocks on the shipyard, while work on AOE-8  has yet to begin.  </P> <P> With each supply ship bringing in about $197 million, Nassco executives expect  to show a profit in 1989 for the first time in three years, Hallett said. If  the Navy exercises its option to buy a fourth and final supply ship next year,  Nassco can expect to earn $1 billion in revenue in 1989 dollars, Hallett said.  </P> <P> Still, the company has a long way to go before it equals its former production  peak, achieved in 1981, when it delivered four ships in a single year. Under  the current Navy contract, Nassco isn't scheduled to deliver a single ship  until the fall of 1991, when the first of the Navy supply ships is expected to  be launched. The remaining two are expected to be delivered in 1992 and 1993.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, ship repairs are the only other work keeping Nassco employees busy.  Work on the shipyard's most famous repair job, the damaged Exxon Valdez  supertanker, which caused the largest oil spill in U.S. history when it ran  aground in Alaska earlier this year, is expected to be completed by summer.  </P> <P> Unlike scores of other American shipyards, Nassco has managed to stay in  business despite financial troubles and a worsening shipbuilding climate.  </P> <P> Industry experts tend to blame foreign shipyards, operating with the help of  government subsidies, for the downturn in American shipbuilding, as well as the  Reagan Administration, which eliminated a domestic subsidy program that allowed  U.S. companies to compete with foreign ones.  </P> <P> In the past eight years, the American shipbuilding industry has lost about  34,000 jobs. And none of the 800 or so commercial shipbuilding contracts  awarded worldwide last year went to American shipyards, said Patrick Morris,  vice president and general counsel for the Shipbuilders Council of America in  Washington.  </P> <P> Shipbuilding experts estimate that military contracts now make up about 95% of  the U. S. shipbuilding industry, whereas, in 1976, only about half the ships  built in the United States were for the military.  </P> <P> With the Soviet Union posing less of a threat and military defense spending  cuts sure to follow, those figures are a source of worry to American shipyard  executives, who have become ever more hungry for a share of the world's  commercial shipbuilding contracts.  </P> <P> "If the military budget is going to go down, you're going to have to replace  those orders with something else," Morris said. "We're trying to create a more  hospitable environment in the commercial arena."  </P> <P> To that end, the Shipbuilding Council filed a petition in June under the 1974  Omnibus Trade Act alleging that Japan, West Germany, Norway and South Korea are  all engaged in unfair trading practices. Commerce Department officials, if they  agree with the petition's allegations, may seek sanctions, such as boycotts,  against a country found to be in violation of fair trade practices.  </P> <P> "We, in our judgment, conclusively document that they are engaged in subsidy  practices, varying from financial scheme to direct subsidies," Morris said.  </P> <P> A month after filing the petition, however, the council withdrew its request  after each country agreed to send trade representatives to the Organization of  Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris for negotiations.  </P> <P> If no agreement is reached by March 31, U.S. shipbuilding interests intend to  file another petition, Morris said.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, American shipbuilding companies are on the offensive, lobbying for  the same public support that won economic sanctions against foreign steel and  auto companies believed to be competing unfairly against U.S.-based companies.  </P> <P> A Nassco position paper issued last month stated: "The sight of bulldozers  ripping holes in the Berlin Wall is a powerful reminder that America will need  to make the transition from a Cold War economy to a more commercially oriented,  non-defense economy during the 1990s. For Nassco and the U.S. shipbuilding  industry, changes in military strategies and probable cuts in defense budges  now and in the future likely will reduce the country's spending on new U. S.  Navy ships.  </P> <P> "Fortunately, there is another worldwide market that is available to Nassco, if  we can only open it to fair competition."  </P> <P> That market is, of course, the commercial market. And its importance to the  future of the shipbuilding industry is clear to anyone who wields a blow torch  on the dry docks -- especially anyone with a stake in a company's future  profits.  </P> <P> Robert Godinez, business manager for the Ironworkers Local 627, representing  about 1,100 iron workers at Nassco, said the manager-employee buyout has made  the workers more interested in decisions that have an impact on the company.  Workers who last year staged a strike to protest scheduled wage cuts are now  aligned with managers in the push for a fair and competitive world shipbuilding  market.  </P> <P> "We have to look at new construction to stay in business in order to keep food  on the table and to keep the guys working," Godinez said. "We feel we're not on  an even keel (with foreign shipyards.) There's no way we can win any  shipbuilding contracts when we're up against the foreign countries who  subsidize their shipyards."  </P></p>

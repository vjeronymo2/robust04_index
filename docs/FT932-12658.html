			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / International Company News: Polish bank sale oversubscribed WIELKOPOLSKI Bank Kredytowy, Poland's first state-owned 'high street' bank to be sold off, has been heavily oversubscribed, according to the finance ministry. Mr Slawomir Sikora, the head of the ministry's banking department, said 710bn zlotys (Dollars 42m) had been offered for the 460,000 shares with total a issue price 52.9bn zlotys. All foreign and local private sector buyers have been issued shares but only 9.2 per cent of the amount they had applied for. This issue represents 10 per cent of the existing capital. However, the bank's capital will be expanded when the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development invest Dollars 12.7m to acquire a 28.5 per cent stake. State-sector company applications for 1m shares in the tranchee were not considered. No investor has been permitted to buy more than 1 per cent of the bank's entire equity. Almost one-fifth of the tranchee was sold to foreign investors, who include several banks. The sale has coincided with an unprecedented rally on the Warsaw stock exchange, which has seen turnover in daily trading in its 16 quoted stocks more than treble since the beginning of last month to yesterday's 203bn zlotys. Today sees the opening of the public sale of a further 1,280,000 shares priced at 115,000 zlotys each in the 'small' investor tranchee.</p>

			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / Technology: Squeaky wheels get the grease - Worth Watching WHEN a train goes round a curve the wheel flanges, which help hold the train on the track, get worn and typically need refurbishing every eight to 12 months. Denco, the British lubrication specialist, has devised a technique which extends the lives of rail-wheel flanges by a factor of three or four. The electronically controlled system, developed in conjunction with British Rail, is fitted to the train and automatically sprays a measured amount of weather-resistant lubricant on to precise points on the flanges of both front and rear bogies. For environmental reasons the amount of lubricant sprayed each time is very small, limiting the spread of oil from the wheel flange to wheel tread. With a typical distance of 200m between spray operations a train can run for 200,000 kilometres before the 6.5-litre oil reservoir need replenishing. British Rail, which hopes to save thousands of pounds a year using the system, has placed an initial order for 30 customised sets. A bonus is that the intrusive squeal from dry wheels running on tight curves should be eliminated, and track wear should be reduced. Denco: UK, 0432 277277.</p>

			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Clifford to stand trial Mr Clark Clifford, the former US defence secretary who is seeking to use health reasons to avoid standing trial on criminal charges stemming from the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) affair, was accused in court yesterday of trying to manipulate the US criminal justice system, writes Alan Friedman in New York. The accusation came from Mr Robert Morgenthau, the New York district attorney who filed a 50-page motion in court to oppose Mr Clifford's request that his BCCI-related case be dismissed because of his heart condition. Lawyers for the 85-year-old Mr Clifford have claimed he should not be tried as he might die as a result of the stress inherent in a court trial. Mr Morgenthau said that dismissing the Clifford case would be wrong since it would indicate that 'public figures can manipulate and avoid the US criminal justice system.'</p>

			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Rabin in call to EC over exports ISRAEL'S prime minister, Mr Yitzhak Rabin, launched a scathing attack on the EC yesterday, demanding better access for Israeli exports to European markets and more vigorous support for the peace process. 'The unjustified discrimination against Israel by the EC cannot be tolerated any longer,' he said. 'We do not need sympathy, we need deeds and acts to support those who have taken risks for peace.' Speaking to the Institute for European Studies at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, he contrasted EC attitudes with those of the US. While the US provided generous aid and its trade with Israel was roughly in balance, the EC was running a trade surplus of about Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.3bn). He did not expect the EC to match the US, but it should let Israel compete. The Israeli leader also wanted a more emphatic European stance against the continuing Arab boycott. The US said it had asked the International Trade Commission to investigate how the Arab boycott of Israel has affected US companies, Reuter reports from Washington.</p>

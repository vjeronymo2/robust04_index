			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cairo, 30 Dec (MENA)--A statement issued today by  the Interior Ministry explained that the security forces this  morning raided al-Badari Island in Asyut, which is controlled by  the al-Hamami family. The commander of the military wing of one  of the terrorist organizations is a member of this family. He  was killed in today's raid, and 57 other terrorists who were  active members of the organization surrendered.    The statement said some papers, possessions, and documents  about specific plans to target public figures and installations  were seized, in addition to large amounts of weapons.    The statement added that one citizen was injured in this  operation and a soldier from the Central Security Forces was  killed.    The statement affirmed that this confrontation was part of  the Interior Ministry's security policy to expand the efforts to  confront various terrorist elements.    The following is the text of the Interior Ministry's  statement about this operation:    As part of the security policy formulated by the Interior  Ministry to expand the scope of the confrontation against all  terrorist elements, which was initiated by the ministry to  strike at the hotbeds and centers of public activities for these  elements in the Governorates of Aswan, Qina, al-Fayyum, and  Asyut--the most recent of which was to strike against the  terrorist groups that were using the mosques of al-Rahmah and  Miftah al-Rahman in Asyut as dens to hide their weapons and  tracts, the State Security Investigations prepared themselves  for a large-scale campaign on al-Badari Island. The island is  controlled by the al-Hamami family, which has a strong grip on  this region. The commander of the military wing of the  terrorist organization in Upper Egypt is terrorist Salah  Muhammad 'Atiyah al-Hamami.    In view of the large area of the island--about 4,500  feddans--and its rough topography, in addition to it being  surrounded by the Nile, a full and comprehensive plan was  prepared after two months of monitoring and scouting the island  to determine all roads leading to and from it.    Forces of the highest level of combat training prepared for  the raid. They were joined by international antiterrorism  forces and armored and amphibious central security forces.  These groups planned to stormed the island and arrest all the  individuals hiding there and using it as a headquarters to  mastermind their operations.    The forces were aided by units from the Asyut Security  Department, the Criminal Investigations Department, and various  investigations groups because of the amount of information they  have about this island.    At 0330 Wednesday, the forces stormed the island in extreme  secrecy and conducted a thorough search. The forces entered the  island according to plan and tightened their control over all  the island's inlets and outlets.    The operation resulted in the death of the terrorist group's  leader and commander of its military wing, Salah Muhammad  'Atiyah al-Hamami, who was wanted in many terrorist cases,  including Case 542/1993 of Markaz Sidfa. This case involves the  assassination of Lieutenant Colonel Mahran 'Abd-al-Rahim, head  of the State Security branch in (?Dayrut), and his son Muhammad.    This terrorist was regarded as the leader of the  organization's military wing. He supervised the training,  planning, and financing of the group's recent terrorist  operations in Asyut, Qina, and Aswan Governorates.    An automatic rifle and a large quantity of ammunition were  found in his possession.    Afterward, 57 active members of the terrorist organization  surrendered to the raiding force. It turned out that some of  them had carried out these operations, some had been in charge  of training, and others were responsible for provisions,  financial support, and conveying orders. All of them (?were)  arrested.    The forces also seized papers, (?letters), and documents  referring to operations that were being planned, including  operations against some public figures and installations. The  forces also seized other documents containing addresses of some  of the organization's fugitive members in various governorates  and providing important clues that will help the authorities  arrest other fugitive terrorists.    Citizen Mustafa Kamil Ahmad 'Uthman was wounded in the  clashes. He was hospitalized, and his current condition is  positive. A Central Security Forces conscript, Rikabi Nur 'Ali,  was killed.    The Prosecution Office was asked to initiate an  investigation  and take legal measures (?against) the arrested suspects. The  forces are still combing the island. Their search is expected  to take some time because of the rough topography of this island.    Plans are also being made for similar campaigns in all  regions of the Republic's governorates that terrorists are  reportedly using as hideouts.    The Interior Ministry affirms that, in the next stage, it  will direct its blows forcefully and decisively against these  sites to eliminate this renegade faction.</p>

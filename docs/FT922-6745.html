			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / S African employment crisis looms UNEMPLOYMENT in South Africa could climb to 7.3m or 57 per cent of the workforce by 2005, according to The International Labour Organisation. Already there are over 5m unemployed, nearly two in five workers, the ILO estimates. While blacks bear the overwhelming burden of joblessness, the ILO says unemployment and poverty have surfaced among whites for the first time since the 1930s. South Africa's labour force is expected to rise from 13.4m in 1990 to 20.2m in 2025, with up to 500,000 workers entering the labour market each year. Only 31,000 new jobs a year were created in the 1980s and fewer since then, mostly in the public sector, the ILO notes. The report also says South Africa has one of the highest rates of child labour in the world.</p>

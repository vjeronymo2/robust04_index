			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / UK Company News: Telemetrix shares hit by US subsidiary's reduced outcome Shares in Telemetrix, the UK-based supplier of specialised electronic components, test equipment and services, fell by 23 per cent after GTI Corporation, its 58 per cent-owned US subsidiary, reported lower first quarter results. Telemetrix shares closed 23p down at 103p. Mr Tim Curtis, chief executive, warned last month, when the group unveiled a 64 per cent profits increase for 1993, that pricing pressures which began in the fourth quarter were affecting GTI's sales and margins on networking products in the US. Yesterday he expressed surprise at the reaction in the market. GTI, which is separately quoted on Nasdaq, reported net income down by 56 per cent to Dollars 1.3m (Pounds 890,000) in the first quarter to March 31, on sales which slipped by 2 per cent to Dollars 30m. Earnings per share dropped by 66 per cent to 13 cents. Mr Gary Luick, GTI's chief executive, said that first quarter unit volume of the company's standard networking product line - 10Base-T - was 30 per cent higher than a year earlier. It accounted for 54 per cent of sales at the networking subsidiary. However, he added: 'Competitive pricing pressures reduced net revenues by 3 per cent as we worked to protect our market share.' Overall networking revenues were flat at Dollars 21.2m (Dollars 21.6m) in the first quarter, but prices were 25 per cent lower than a year ago. Mr Luick added that the company was addressing the lower price levels by cutting costs and moving production to a new automated plant in the Philippines, while preparing for the introduction of new higher-margin products based on the latest networking technologies.</p>

			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / Italian media upset Berlusconi The chief of staff of Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister, yesterday accused the media of applying double standards when judging the Italian government and its predecessors. Mr Gianni Letta, former deputy chairman of Mr Berlusconi's Fininvest group, complained to journalists that the three-month-old government was getting a rough deal compared with the previous technocratic administration of Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi. Mr Berlusconi's government has made a series of political mistakes recently, and come under attack from the opposition and from members of the coalition itself, most notably the populist Northern League. The onset of the summer holidays does not seem to have reduced the pressure on Mr Berlusconi, or on Italian markets. The Italian lira weakened yesterday in slow trading to close at L1,001 against the D-Mark, amid worries about the coherence of the coalition. Mr Letta's press conference was called to clear the air following suspension of a pro-government TV advertising campaign. Certain commercials outlining the achievements of the Berlusconi government were pulled by state television on Monday, after Italy's media ombudsman reacted to claims that the government was abusing its right to screen commercials for public information only. The part of the campaign explaining changes in tax policy is still running, and Mr Letta said yesterday Mr Berlusconi - whose Fininvest group owns three Italian commercial TV stations - would not be deterred from launching such campaigns in future. He pointed out that the outgoing Ciampi government had issued extensive press releases outlining its achievements. '(The Ciampi government) .. received only praise, whereas the Berlusconi government has had only abuse,' he said. Meanwhile, Mr Umberto Bossi, the Northern League's leader, has indicated the League will put forward its own set of economic measures after the holiday on August 26. Meanwhile, Italian newspapers yesterday carried reports of the interrogation of Mr Berlusconi's younger brother Paolo by Milan magistrates, based on a transcript of the interview. According to this, Paolo admitted authorising payments of L330bn to Italian anti-fraud police to avoid tax investigations into Fininvest companies. TV farce, Page 14</p>

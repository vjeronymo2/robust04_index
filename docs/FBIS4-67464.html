			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Steen Voigt: "Denmark's Global Scrub Brush"] </F>   [Text] As part of the effort to follow up on the United  Nations' global environment and development summit in Rio de  Janeiro, the Folketing resolved on 18 December 1992 to increase  global environmental and catastrophe aid. The goal is to use  half a percent of gross national income (GNI) for the purpose in  2002 -- probably around 6 billion kroner. Half of this will go  directly to environmental efforts.    Denmark has allocated more than 600 million kroner for  global  environmental aid in 1994 to meet its international commitments.  The investment, which will be close to 3 billion kroner annually  in 2002, is expected to set an example for other donor nations.    Denmark's global scrub brush will pick up speed in the years  ahead.    And it will go to work in East and Central Europe, Southeast  Asia, southern Africa, the Arctic region, and many other places  around the world.    The government's recent approval of a long-term  environmental  strategy from the Environment Ministry and the Foreign Ministry  makes it possible to move fairly quickly to follow up the  statements from the environmental summit in Rio de Janeiro in  1992 and the meeting of European environment ministers in  Lucerne last year with massive economic action.    The money will be taken primarily from the environmental and  catastrophe aid fund that a Folketing majority decided to set up  on 18 December 1992 to strengthen our efforts with respect to  international environmental problems.    The environmental part of the fund involves 500 million  kroner this year and will increase by 200 million kroner a year  until 1998. The goal is to provide a total of 0.5 percent of  national income by the year 2002, around 6 billion kroner, half  of which will go to the environment.    In addition the Foreign Ministry will channel a nine-digit  sum annually, 145 million kroner this year, primarily to UN  organizations where the money, along with the contributions from  other countries, will be used for environmental projects.    For the first few years the Foreign Ministry will also  finance distinctly environmental projects in the poorest  selected countries in Southeast Asia, Vietnam, Cambodia, and  Laos, through its general development aid. But later on, in  1996, these countries will also come under the fund.  <H5>  Unique </H5>   This joint long-term strategy means that Denmark is the  first  donor nation in the world to put its international environmental  aid in a fixed framework.    "The environmental and catastrophe fund is unique on the  international level and I definitely think it will set an  example for like-minded donors in the UN circle, i.e., countries  like Norway, Sweden, the Netherlands, Canada, and the United  States, and perhaps Germany as well," said Leo Larsen, assistant  administrative director of the Environment Agency.    He is head of the department of the Environment Agency that  takes care of environmental aid, which is currently in the  process of being expanded. The department will have almost 30  employees.    The four individual parts of the environmental strategy  designate the countries and their environmental problems that  the Danes feel especially qualified to tackle. Also with  reference to the sale of Danish environmental technology and  know-how and thus more jobs and additional technological  advances in this country.  <H5>  From Europe to Asia </H5>   More than half the money will be used close to home: in the  three Baltic countries, Poland, and the heavily polluted and  polluting Russian areas around Kaliningrad and St. Petersburg.  In addition, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary also have  a high priority.    A somewhat smaller nine-digit sum will go to Thailand and  Malaysia in Southeast Asia where, as mentioned above, the  Foreign Ministry will initially support the neighboring  countries through development aid.    The special developing countries department is also  considering aid for countries in southern Africa, but so far no  recipients have been designated.    "This is mainly because we were working so hard to formulate  a program for Southeast Asia that there was no time for anything  else. And plans for Africa will not be relevant this year. At  most there will be some preliminary soundings," Larsen said.    The reason why the Environment Agency specifically chose the  five developing countries in Southeast Asia is that it was  seeking a single contiguous region and that emphasis was placed  on going into a growth area.    Thailand and Malaysia are experiencing rapid economic  development. It appears that Vietnam will follow suit within a  fairly short time and the countries' purchasing power in the  commercial environmental market obviously played a part in the  selection.    "It is clear that environmental considerations are the most  important for all this. But it is also obvious that we are  drawing on the vast Danish knowledge in this context. Therefore  the selection also reflected the fact that the Danish state and  its business sector are telling these countries: `This is what  we can offer. What do you need?' Where these two things  coincide, things happen. And I think this is quite legitimate,"  Larsen said.    He foresees that Danish businesses can participate in about  half of the fund's environmental aid in the form of supplying  environmental technology and knowledge. But an investment must  be made, among other things, through product development.    "There are big perspectives for the Danish environmental  industry in the countries of Southeast Asia. With all respect  for our funding, the countries' own investments in combating  pollution are enormous in relation to the small amount of aid  they receive. I would guess that they receive less than 10  percent from outside sources, the rest they pay themselves,"  said Larsen.    Apropos money and industry, the world market for  environmental technology is big and growing. In 1990 it amounted  to a good 1.2 trillion kroner and will rise to an estimated 2  trillion kroner by the year 2000.  <H5>  To the Poorest </H5>   The environmental strategy designates four investment areas  in Southeast Asia, namely cities, forests, coastal zones, and  the protection of biological diversity, i.e., animals, plants,  habitats, ecosystems, and genetic variation. At the same time an  effort will be made to provide the aid to the poorest areas of  the country and the poorest sections of the cities because there  is a clear connection between their pollution, health, and  poverty problems.    And just as in the eastern nations, conservation will be  given its "natural" place because Denmark has a lot of  experience with sustainable management and protection of nature  preserves.    Environmental aid for the Arctic region also comes under the  developing countries section, with the emphasis on Greenland.  Especially monitoring and conducting research into ocean and air  pollution, climatic changes, and the thinning of the ozone  layer. But part of the aid will probably be used to help Russia  monitor its long coastal stretches along the enormous ocean  areas.    "It is necessary to give the Russians some kind of  assistance  in providing environmental data from their region for otherwise  the picture we get of the total stress on the ocean will be  incomplete. At present we have no clear impression of how much  pollution, including radioactive pollution, they have there,"  Larsen said.  <H5>  Environmentally Correct </H5>   As mentioned above the Foreign Ministry is in charge of the  fourth part of the joint strategy, namely multilateral aid.    Environment Ambassador Erik Fiil, who heads the ministry's  environment secretariat, expects that the largest amount will be  given to the so-called global environmental facility (GEF). This  is controlled by the World Bank and the two UN organizations for  the environment and development, the UN Environment Program  (UNEP) and the UN Development Program (UNDP).    The ministry has just started a biogas project in Tanzania  in  cooperation with the GEF, which has been selected as the  financial mechanism for the Rio summit's four main areas:  climatic changes (with the climate convention that goes into  effect on 21 March), biological diversity, ocean pollution, and  the depletion of the ozone layer. Forest and desert projects may  also be considered.    In addition, multilateral Danish environmental aid will  continue to go directly to UNEP, UNDP, and a number of  international environmental organizations, including private  ones, for example the World Wildlife Fund and Nepenthes, the  rain forest group.    Incidentally, the Foreign Ministry's environment secretariat  was set up last September to follow up on the Rio summit's  principle that environmental protection should form an integral  part of development policy, among other things.    "Thus it is also our task to constantly remind our  colleagues  in DANIDA [Danish International Development Authority] that  their development projects must also be environmentally correct,  so that all our international aid will now hang together," said  Erik Fiil.  <H5>  [Box, p 7] </H5>    -  Air pollution: Combating local and multicountry air  pollution in the East European nations and in the cities of  Southeast Asia through support for increasing efficiency and  purifying heat and energy production, promoting alternative  energy sources, and improving mass transit.    -  Ocean pollution: Support for treating waste water from  industries and cities in East Europe, which will benefit the  Baltic Sea. In Southeast Asian cities it will benefit the  important ocean areas along the coast, which function among  other things as a development area for young fish. Agricultural  advice on fertilization to reduce the nutrient load in oceans,  for example the Baltic Sea.    -  Nuclear power plants: The goal is to continue to improve  safety, especially at the Ignalina nuclear power plant in  Lithuania and at Sosnovy Bor near St. Petersburg (both of the  Chernobyl type) through aid for improving control systems, fire  protection, and communications. The aim is to make the plants  superfluous through aiding other energy sources.    -  Ozone layer/greenhouse effect: Aid to Greenland under the  Arctic program for compliance with international conventions.  Aid for reducing CO[.sub]2[/] emissions and the use of  substances that destroy the ozone layer in East European  countries, for example, through improving energy efficiency,  making traffic more environmentally friendly and phasing out the  harmful substances.    -  Hazardous waste: Aid for limiting and eliminating hazardous  waste from industries in the East European countries and in  Southeast Asia, for improving local household waste systems, and  for the environmentally correct location and establishment of  incinerators and recycling plants.    -  Environmental technology: Environmental efforts include the  transfer of (Danish) environmental technology to recipient  countries -- which will also benefit employment and the further  development of environmental knowledge and technology in  Denmark. Danish firms, authorities, and institutes have a great  deal of knowledge in the key areas of handling waste, water  treatment plants, protecting ground water, cleaning smoke, and  combating ocean pollution.    -  Conservation: Aid for preserving the large untouched natural  areas that still exist in East Europe -- in spite of everything  -- along with their animal and plant life by expanding preserves  and restoring and including consideration for nature in  agricultural and forestry methods. In Southeast Asia aid for  regenerating forests and preserving biological diversity, among  other things. Aid to safeguard the delicate ecological balance  in the Arctic.    -  Environmental training: Support for developing environmental  and conservation regulations, the training and education of  personnel, and building up both central and local environmental  and nature authorities. Providing advice on regulation in the  environmental area via both rules and taxes. Support for  improved supervision of the environment and nature.

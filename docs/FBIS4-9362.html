			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Teodor Melescanu by Goran </F> Gotev; place and date not given: "Romania Is a Country of  Equilibrium, Dialogue, and Stability"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Gotev] The announcement that  Romania is the second Eastern European country, following  Poland, to halt the decline in production and show signs of a  rise in its GNP caused a sensation in Bulgaria. How do you  explain these results and what effect will they have on your  relations with other countries?    [Melescanu] Our country's leadership has been concerned with  halting the economic decline since 1990, but due to the existing  internal and external conditions, this goal was only achieved in  1993. It happened because of the continuous efforts to  restructure and technologically reequip our industrial  enterprises, to privatize whole sectors of our national economy,  such as trade, tourism, and construction, and to return the land  to the peasants. At the same time, we completed a restructuring  of the banking system, decentralized foreign trade, and  supported free enterprise in the small industry and services  sectors. This year we plan to carry out a major privatization  of industry.    These results can increase the confidence of business  circles  in the developed states in the opportunities for cooperation  with Romania, which for us will lead to an increase in foreign  investments and support from the international financial  organizations.    [Gotev] How do you view the prospects for the development of  Bulgarian-Romanian relations, which includes taking joint  foreign policy initiatives in the Balkans and the Black Sea zone?    [Melescanu] Romania ascribes particular importance to  comprehensively developing its relations with Bulgaria. No  disputed or unresolved problems remain between our countries.  Since 1990, Romanian-Bulgarian cooperation has been progressing  positively in all fields. Despite the fact that we have no  top-level official contacts for one year, I am sure that the  relations of cooperation and good-neighborliness between Romania  and Bulgaria will continue to advance further in the interest of  both countries, so as to provide a model of stability in the  Balkans. At the same time, I think that Romania and Bulgaria  should actively cooperate in formulating a coordinated foreign  policy line for cooperation in the Balkans and the Black Sea  zone. Our country will use every occasion to hold consultations  with Bulgaria with a view to adopting decisions to the benefit  of stability, trust, and prosperity in our region.    [Gotev] Where do Romania's preferences lie: toward the  European alternative, or toward affiliation to the Balkan  Orthodox region?    [Melescanu] The point of European and Euro-Atlantic  integration is precisely to develop a united, stable,  democratic, and prosperous Europe. As far as the Central and  Eastern European countries are concerned, this is the only way  to confirm and consolidate their national, political, economic,  and security interests. It is evident that regional and sub  regional cooperation has a very important part to play within  the all-European architectural framework. Projects such as the  Central European initiative, Black Sea economic cooperation, and  Balkan cooperation when the tragic Bosnian conflict ends are a  necessary complement to the our state's efforts toward European  integration. The tracing of new lines of demarcation in Europe,  whether based on ethnic, religious, economic, or security  criteria, may become a risk factor for our continent's  stability. Romania has constantly and firmly spoken out for  averting such artificial barriers, which can only become  substitutes for the ideological barriers with which we are so  familiar.    [Gotev] What priorities does Romanian diplomacy have for  1994?    [Melescanu] Our priorities may be defined as lying in three  complementary directions. First, we want to continue the  process of integration with the political, economic, and  security structures of Europe and the Euro-Atlantic alliance.  Ratifying and bringing into effect the association treaty with  the EU, concluding a treaty with NATO within the Partnership for  Peace Initiative, establishing long-term relations with the  Western European Union, and switching over to a "permanent route  forward" within the Council of Europe -- these are only some of  the goals we have set ourselves for the near future.    Second, we want to impart fresh dynamism to our relations  with neighboring states and other countries in the region. The  conclusion of basic political treaties with states like Hungary,  the Republic of Moldova, the Russian Federation, and Ukraine can  assist the ascending development of Romania's relations with  these states, and at the same time create a favorable political  climate.    Third, in our foreign policy efforts we want to expand and  diversify our relations with states or groups of states in other  geographical zones with which Romania maintains permanent and  fruitful relations.</p>

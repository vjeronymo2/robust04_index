			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Program buying and bond rally spur Dow Wall Street A BIG bond market rally, prompted by news of weaker than expected economic growth, and heavy program trading combined to spur US share prices ahead yesterday, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 13.97 at 3,567.42, less than a point short of its all-time high. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 climbed 3.05 to 450.24, while the Nasdaq composite gained 1.65 at 707.24. Trading volume on the New York SE came to 266.5m shares. Although the day's main economic news was not encouraging, the sharp fall in bond yields that followed was good for sentiment. The Commerce Department's announcement that GDP grew by 1.6 per cent in the second quarter surprised analysts, who had been expecting growth of more than 2 per cent. The unexpected weakness in economic growth sparked heavy buying of government securities, which pushed the yield on the 30-year bond down to 6.58 per cent. The drop in yields delighted equity investors, who have been worried lately by rising bond yields, and after a hesitant start it led to a rush of demand for stocks around mid-morning. The upward movement in prices was exacerbated by a spate of buy programs. The gains were achieved in spite of the bad economic news (which included a bigger than forecast 43,000 rise in weekly jobless claims), and the disappointing overnight news that the German central bank had decided not to lower its main interest rate. Motor shares were firmer. General Motors added Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 47 3/8 after the company announced second-quarter earnings of Dollars 889.1m, a big improvement on a year earlier, when following a big restructuring charge GM posted a loss of Dollars 703.2m. Ford Motor and Chrysler, which reported stronger profits earlier this week, were markedly higher, up Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 53 1/4 and Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 43 3/4 respectively. Insurance stocks advanced on good earnings news. American International Group ended Dollars 3 1/4 stronger at Dollars 137 7/8 , Transamerica firmed Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 56 1/8 and Lincoln National added Dollars 2 3/8 at Dollars 40 3/8 . ITT appreciated Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 88 3/4 after the diversified conglomerate revealed a 152 per cent increase in second-quarter profits to Dollars 267m. Drug issues, which rose sharply on Wednesday on news of several major alliances in the global pharmaceuticals business, fell back. Johnson &amp; Johnson lost Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 36 3/4 , Merck Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 30 1/2 , Schering-Plough Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 63 and Pfizer Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 61 3/4 . Canada TORONTO stocks extended their winning streak to four straight days, boosted by a surge in gold shares. The TSE 300 index jumped 34.4 to 3,957.5 and rises led declines by 448 to 269 after volume of 51.8m shares valued at CDollars 630m. The golds index advanced 5.4 per cent as the New York spot gold bullion price climbed USDollars 3.75 an ounce.</p>

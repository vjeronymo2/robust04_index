			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Nalgo signs deal with agency NALGO, the public service union, yesterday signed an agreement with Reed Care, a large employment agency, which will encourage union membership among temporary social workers. Under the one-year agreement Reed Care will urge its temporary workers to join Nalgo and the union will recommend the agency to local authorities. The deal appears to check the trend towards the greater use of non-union temporary workers. Reed Care has pledged not to supply temporary care staff as replacements for workers involved in a strike. It will also advise its temporary workers not to cross official picket lines.</p>

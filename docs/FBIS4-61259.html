			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksandr Mineyev] </F>   [Text] Brussels, 4 May -- Today Azerbaijan became the 15th  country to join the "Partnership for Peace" program proposed by  NATO countries and states of Eastern Europe and the former  Soviet Union. Geydar Aliyev, president of Azerbaijan, signed the  program's outline document at the NATO Brussels headquarters  today.    Speaking at the signing ceremony, Aliyev stressed that his  country adheres to the principles of democracy and free  enterprise. Its foreign policy proceeds from the principle of  interdependence of the present-day world and is based on the  principles of respect for national independence, sovereignty,  territorial integrity, and nonviolation of borders.    At the same time, Aliyev noted, Azerbaijan is experiencing a  grave economic crisis caused by a collapse of ties with the  former Soviet republics and the transition to a new economic  system. The crisis is being aggravated by the armed conflict  with Armenia. Aliyev stated there is no military solution to the  conflict and favors stepping up the efforts of international  organizations, first of all the UNO and the CSCE Minsk group,  aimed to attain a settlement at the negotiation table. The  conditions put forward by his country for these talks consist of  an immediate cease-fire and the withdrawal of Armenian troops  from Azerbaijan's occupied territories. The talks should ensure  Azerbaijan's territorial integrity. It is only after this that  Baku is prepared to examine the issue of a status of autonomy  for Nagornyy Karabakh.    In signing the document on partnership, Azerbaijan,  according  to Aliyev, visualizes for itself two main goals for the  development of cooperation with NATO: the country's integration  into Western democracy and its quest for additional ways to  stabilize the situation in the Caucasus and to end the war  between Azerbaijan and Armenia.    Sergio Balanzino, the NATO deputy secretary general who  chaired today's session of the NATO Council, noted that regional  conflicts today are a serious threat to stability and security  in the zone of Europe and the Atlantic. Within the framework of  the Council for North Atlantic Cooperation, which includes both  Azerbaijan and Armenia, the countries of the alliance are making  efforts to mediate with the purpose of a peaceful settlement to  the conflict. He welcomed the measures taken in this direction  by the Minsk CSCE group, stressing that only a solution of this  kind can bring peace back to the region. Participation in the  "Partnership for Peace" program will develop in accordance with  the the tempo and content Azerbaijan itself determines,  Balanzino noted, expressing the hope that this cooperation would  contribute to stability and security in Transcaucasia and  throughout the Euro-Atlantic zone.    Also today Geydar Aliyev met the Belgian Prime Minister  Jean-Luc Dehaene. He invited the head of the Belgian Government  to visit Azerbaijan and expressed confidence that a treaty of  friendship and cooperation between the two countries would be  signed during his visit to Baku.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 28 KYODO -- New Posts and  Telecommunications Minister Katsuyuki Hikasa is one of the main  policy experts in Buddhist-backed Komeito [Clean Government  Party], an influential party in the coalition government.    Hikasa, 48, Komeito's Policy Board chairman, has never  failed  to peruse the bulk of budget documents every year ever since the  party was in the opposition camp until last August. He played  an active role in the ruling parties to draft 1994 budget bills  and a tax reform plan.    Hikasa replaced Takenori Kanzaki, his comrade in Komeito.  Hikasa is said to be friendly and is well versed in ancient  arts and ceramics.    He has been elected a House of Representatives legislator  four times from the No. 1 constituency in Okayama Prefecture.</p>

			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / In search of that old Strauss magic: Bavaria's radical new premier plans tough action to restore the state's fortunes The headline in Munich's Suddeutsche Zeitung said it clearly enough: Bavaria is selling its family silver. Within a month of taking over as prime minister of Germany's prosperous and independent-minded 'free state' of Bavaria, Mr Edmund Stoiber, a former state interior minister and law-and-order crusader in the ruling Christian Social Union, appears to be hell-bent on privatising his government's most profitable shareholdings. Large strategic stakes in Bayernwerk, one of Germany's big three energy utilities, and Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa), the Daimler Benz aerospace subsidiary which contains what used to be Messerschmidt, are to be sold off. The state's one-third share in the Rhine-Main-Danube canal company is another candidate for disposal, along with a host of smaller holdings in areas such as energy and waste disposal. Mr Stoiber hopes to raise DM2bn-DM3bn from the process. While other Lander, and the federal government itself, are merely muttering about a new phase of privatisation, Bavaria looks set to start. The state premier also announced that all political privileges for government ministers and senior officials are to be abolished: everything ranging from free seats at the Bavarian state opera to salaries for lucrative seats on company supervisory boards, must in future be accounted for and, where necessary, repaid to state funds. It is the most radical step in Germany so far to counter the wave of public disquiet over endless petty scandals in ministerial offices. In recent months a string of leading politicians have been forced to resign. The most recent was Mr Stoiber's predecessor, Mr Max Streibl, who admitted taking holidays at a business friend's expense. Mr Stoiber's move also strikes at the heart of the cosy relationship enjoyed by business and the political establishment in Germany, and in Bavaria as much as anywhere. It is enough to make Mr Franz Josef Strauss, the father of Bavaria's postwar economic revival, promoter and close patron of its defence and aerospace industry, and prime minister until he died in office in 1988, turn in his grave. Or perhaps it is precisely what he would have done. For Mr Stoiber is the man who probably more than any other was Mr Strauss' closest confidant over his last decade in power. First as secretary-general of the CSU, then as head of the state chancery, and finally as minister of state in the prime minister's office, he was often the mouthpiece of his master in his negotiations with Bonn and the other federal states. Today he is attempting to bring a little bit of the Strauss magic back to Munich, where the sharp downturn in the German economy, the costs of unification and severe cuts in the federal government's defence budget are undermining Bavaria's own success story. Worse still, for a politician, Mr Stoiber's ruling CSU is in danger of losing its absolute majority in the state parliament in next year's elections. It faces an erosion of support both to the Social Democrats on the left, and to the far-rightwing Republicans. And it is facing up to the humiliating possibility that it might fail altogether to win any seats in the European Parliament, because its shrinking provincial base is not enough to guarantee it the minimum national vote of 5 per cent. Germany faces no fewer than 19 European, national, state and local authority elections next year, and three concern Bavaria directly. Mr Stoiber believes they will be decided by two issues: the economy and internal security, including the highly-sensitive issue of immigration. On both issues he faces a big challenge. Bavaria remains one of the wealthiest states in the federal republic, thanks to the range of modern industry which Mr Strauss successfully enticed, browbeat or simply bought with straight subsidies to come to his home state. The defence industry has been as badly hit as any by the recent budget cuts and the economic downturn. Dasa alone has said it will lay off some 8,000 workers. But Mr Stoiber knows that the economic challenge is more profound. 'What we have today is not a normal recession, but a structural recession which we would have had to overcome even if there had not been unification,' he says. 'You have the same problems in Britain, France or Sweden. But we have the low-wage countries on our very doorstep.' Mr Stoiber's answer is to relaunch the drive to promote an indigenous high-tech industry, focused on small and medium-sized enterprises - Germany's famed Mittelstand. And that is precisely where he plans to put the funds he can raise from privatisation. 'It is not just a question of our financial problems,' he says. 'It is a question of principle for me. We don't want state capitalism here. I am a great supporter of privatisation.' He recognises that the state's 58 per cent stake in Bayernwerk played an important role in Bavaria's economic success. For the Bavarian government ensured that electricity supplies were switched steadily from reliance on expensive coal from the northern Ruhr, to first oil and now nuclear power. With two-thirds of its power from that source, Bavaria now has the cheapest electricity in Germany. The change is that the European energy market is opening up, and other producers, such as France, are offering cheap supplies. 'It is no longer necessary to have a state energy policy operated through one's own energy company,' Mr Stoiber says. He may be a bit disingenuous. The plan is gradually to merge Bayernwerk with Viag, the Bonn-based conglomerate which is already a minority shareholder. In return, Mr Stoiber expects Viag to move to Munich. And for the time being, the state will retain its 25.1 per cent stake in Viag. Privatisation is only one radical answer to the problems of Bavaria and the CSU. The latest polls show the ruling party languishing on about 43 per cent of popular support - down almost 12 percentage points on the 1990 election - with the SPD, the real challengers, up to almost 33 per cent. Yet the Republicans, on the far right, are the real threat to the CSU's traditional conservative heartland. They are both anti-immigration and anti-EC. The former is one clear reason why the party opted for Mr Stoiber over the more middle-of-the-road Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister in Bonn and party leader. The Bavarian premier certainly does not mince his words on questions of immigration. 'We are not an immigration country,' he insists. 'That would result in a multi-cultural society. And a multi-cultural society would be a terrible thing.' And yet he is not a fanatical nationalist. Like Mr Strauss, he is a convinced European, although he believes the Maastricht agenda for a single currency is far too optimistic. 'Economic and monetary union will not come about this century,' he says. 'The convergence criteria are the main barrier, and they must not be changed. In the foreseeable future, no member state will be able to meet them.' In some ways, Mr Stoiber sounds almost like a sceptical UK conservative. He is a critic of excessive Brussels decision-making and believes the EC should go slow on institutional integration, and concentrate on enlargement. Mr Stoiber says the Republicans have lost much of their grounds for criticism with the tougher restrictions on asylum-seekers, which came into effect on July 1. He played a big part in drafting the measures in Bonn, as state Bavaria's interior minister. Yet perhaps the greatest threat he sees to all the traditional political parties is the growing public apathy and alienation from the political process. That is why he has seized the political initiative so swiftly, both on privatisation and privilege. Even if he is selling off the family silver, Mr Strauss would probably have approved of the motive.</p>

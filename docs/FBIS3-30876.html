			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bratislava, February 6 (CTK) -- In a few days' time  petitions should appear in the Slovak streets from the Movement  for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) which needs to collect 350,000  signatures in order to call a referendum on the filling of  mandates in parliament, Slovak Premier Vladimir Meciar announced  on the "Kroky" television programme today.    In the referendum people would decide whether those deputies  who have left the party on whose slate they were elected should  leave parliament.    "The preliminary work is near to completion. Let people  decide themselves who they want in parliament and who not,"  Meciar said, adding that "if a referendum does not provide a  way out, early elections will be needed."    Opposition leaders Peter Weiss, Jan Carnogursky and Bela  Bugar, however, see early elections as the first way out of the  current parliamentary crisis which came to a head at the end of  last week when some HZDS deputies walked out, thus preventing a  crucial decision on the privatization of state property worth  220 billion Slovakia korunas.    Before that, the HZDS' post-election majority had been  eroded  by the gradual departure of nine deputies from the party. A  coalition with the Slovak National Party (SNS) proved of little  help after six of the 14 SNS deputies broke away and have now  effectively joined the opposition.    Meciar said today that the results of the last elections had  to be respected. "Attempts to make Deputy Premier Roman Kovac  and Foreign Minister Jozef Moravcik out to be second Knazko  (Milan Knazko, one of the departed HZDS deputies) are the affair  of the media. There are no basic differences of opinion between  me and Kovac," Meciar said, assuring there would be no further  splits in the HZDS.    It has been speculated in the media that Kovac and Moravcik  are considering creating a faction with the support of several  HZDS deputies.    Chairman of Parliament Ivan Gasparovic said in a television  debate that the parliamentary session would continue on February  16. Meciar says however that the session will not take place  unless the opposition allows Gasparovic to regain his  constitutional authority in the direction of the session. Weiss  has promised that the Democratic Left Party (SDL) will put  forward a proposal for a solution to the crisis by February 16.    Most of today's television discussion was taken up by the  amendment to the law on large privatization which parliament had  been debating. The opposition calls for greater control over  what the government and premier do in this area. As there is at  present no privatization minister in Slovakia, the post is  filled by Meciar, who is also Chairman of the National Property  Fund (FNM).    Chairman of the Christian Democratic Party Jan Carnogursky  said today that this joining of posts and the loss of  parliamentary control over privatization would lead to "the  corruption of public life," to the lowering of the value of  state property, the slowing down of the privatization process  and the stagnation of the Slovak economy.    Meciar rejected this accusation, and accused opposition  politicians of having financial connections with 21 key  joint-stock companies in which the FNM had called extraordinary  plenary sessions with the aim of a change in statutes and a  changes in their supervisory councils.    He also argued that the privatization process in south  Slovakia was ruled by Hungarian capital. "There is at least 55  percent Hungarian capital in nationally mixed areas, as much as  68 percent," he said.    To this the chairman of the Hungarian Christian Democratic  movement MKDH, Bela Bugar, said when the government is in a  tight spot it pulls out the nationalist card.</p>

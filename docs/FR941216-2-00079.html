Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ``Act'' means the Clean Water Act (formerly referred to as the Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Water Pollution Control Act) Public Law 92&hyph;500, as amended by Public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Laws 95&hyph;217, 95&hyph;576, 96&hyph;483, 97&hyph;117, and Public Law 100&hyph;4, 33 U.S.C.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1251 et seq.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Concentration Measurements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> a. The ``average monthly concentration'', is the sum of the concentrations of all daily discharges sampled and/or measured during a calendar month on which daily discharges are sampled and measured, divided by the number of daily discharges sampled and/or measured during such month (arithmetic mean of the daily concentration values). The daily concentration value is equal to the concentration of a composite sample or in the case of grab samples is the arithmetic mean (weighted by flow value) of all the samples collected during the calendar day.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. The ``maximum daily concentration'', is the concentration of a pollutant discharge during a calendar day. It is identified as ``Daily Maximum'' under ``Other Limits'' in Part I of the permit and the highest such value recorded during the reporting period is reported under the ``Maximum'' column under ``Quality'' on the DMR.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Other Measurements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> a. The effluent flow expressed as MGD is the 24 hour average flow averaged monthly. It is the arithmetic mean of the total daily flows recorded during the calendar month. Where monitoring requirements for flow are specified in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Part I of the permit the flow rate values are reported in the ``Average'' column under ``Quantity'' on the DMR.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

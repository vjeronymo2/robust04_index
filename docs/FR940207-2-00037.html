The following summary also contains a list of submissions that were dismissed by the Office of Hearings and Appeals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=3 --> Whistleblower Proceeding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=3 --> Ronald Sorri, 12/16/93, LWA&hyph;0001 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Ronald Sorri (Sorri) filed a request for a hearing on June 9, 1993 under the Department of Energy's Contractor Employee Protection Program, 10 C.F.R. Part 708. This case involved a whistleblower complaint filed by Sorri under DOE's new Contractor Employee Protection Program, charging that reprisals were taken against him after he raised safety concerns with Sandia National Laboratories, DOE, and Congressman Leon Panetta. The alleged reprisals included removing him from his job as a maintenance technician in Sandia's Microelectronics Development Laboratory; giving him lowered performance ratings; reassigning him to a job as a technical writer; and finally, firing him. DOE's Office of Contractor Employee Protection (OCEP) investigated the complaint and found that the first three actions were reprisals for Sorri's disclosure of safety concerns. However, OCEP concluded the Sorri's termination did not constitute a reprisal. Sorri requested a hearing before a Hearing Officer with the Office of Hearings and Appeals, maintaining that his termination was also a reprisal for his safety disclosures. The Hearing Office concluded that Sorri proved by a preponderance of the evidence that he engaged in activities protected under Part 708 and that these activities were a contributing factor in the decision by Sandia and L&amp;M to terminate his employment. The Hearing Officer further concluded that Sandia and L&amp;M failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that they would have terminated Sorri's employment were it not for his whistleblowing activities. The Hearing Officer therefore determined that Sorri's termination violated the whistleblower regulations in 10 C.F.R. Part 708. Sorri was awarded $5,000 in back pay, plus attorney's fees and costs. Sandia and L&amp;M have the right to appeal the Decision to the Secretary or her designee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=3 --> Motion for Discovery  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=3 --> Oxy USA Inc., 12/17/93, LRD&hyph;0006, LRH&hyph;0002 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> OXY USA Inc. (OXY) filed Motions for Discovery and Evidentiary Hearing in connection with the firm's Statement of Objections to a February 1992 Revised Proposed Remedial Order (the Revised PRO) issued to the firm by the DOE's Economic Regulatory Administration (ERA). The Revised PRO concerns reciprocal crude oil transactions entered into by OXY's predecessor in interest, Cities Service Company (Cities). Those transactions generally involved the sale by Cities of price-controlled crude oil in exchange for its receipt of deeply discounted exempt crude oil. The ERA alleges that Cities' reporting of these transactions violated the entitlements reporting requirements set forth at 10 C.F.R. &sect;211.67(b), (h), and (j) and the anti-circumvention rule set forth at 10 C.F.R. &sect;205.202.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In considering the firm's discovery requests, the DOE found that, with the exception of privileged material, OXY had already been provided with information relevant to the charges in the Revised PRO. Accordingly, the discovery motion was denied. In considering the firm's evidentiary hearing motion, the DOE held that OXY should be granted an evidentiary hearing to support its contentions that (i) Cities' officials believed, and had a plausible basis for believing, that entitlements-exempt uses, rather than miscertification, explained the transactions and (ii) the transactions were not shams. The DOE denied OXY's request for an evidentiary hearing on the issues of the scope of Cities' court action concerning the transactions and the sufficiency of Cities' contemporaneous disclosure concerning the transactions, on the ground that those issues should be resolved on the basis of the record of the litigation and submissions by Cities to the DOE. Accordingly, the evidentiary hearing motion was granted in part.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

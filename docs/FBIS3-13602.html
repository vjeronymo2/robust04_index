			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] INA has learned that France wants to change Rolf  Ekeus, chairman of the UN Special Commission. High-level  diplomatic sources told INA that French Ambassador Jean-Bernard  Merimee met with the nonaligned states' ambassadors at the UN  Security Council yesterday afternoon and discussed with them the  UN Security Council's relations with Iraq. He told the  ambassadors: Yes, Ekeus is a gentle, diplomatic, and diligent  person, but, frankly speaking, I say to you that Ekeus must be  changed as the Special Commission chairman because his actions  depend on one viewpoint, which is the U.S. viewpoint, without  taking into consideration the viewpoints of the other states at  the UN Security Council.    The INA correspondent has verified the French Ambassador's  remarks from other diplomatic sources that took part in  yesterday's meeting.</p>

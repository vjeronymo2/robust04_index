			<p><P> September 28, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SUSPECT PLEADS INSANITY IN DEATH OF  WIFE, CHILD;  </P> <P> SANTA ANA  </P> <P> A Santa Ana man who had admitted to police that he killed his wife and their  infant daughter in January has entered an insanity plea in Orange County  Superior Court.  </P> <P> Joseph Peter Lynch, 43, in custody at the Orange County Jail, had been treated  for depression at the time of the killings. He will now be examined by  court-appointed psychiatrists, which could mean a delay in his Dec. 12 trial  date.  </P> <P> Santa Ana police found the body of 35-year-old Helen Lynch and their  13-month-old daughter, Natalie Alexandra, at the couple's condominium in the  700 block of West 1st Street on Jan. 17, 1989. Lynch's wife had been bludgeoned  to death, and the daughter died two days later.  </P> <P> Lynch at first blamed a neighbor for the crime, but soon admitted he was  responsible. The officers testified that Lynch told them he had beaten his wife  with an empty champagne bottle following an argument and that the child  inadvertently had received blows while in her mother's arms. Two other  daughters were asleep at the time.  </P> <P> Because Lynch, who is an electrical engineer, is accused of multiple murders,  he could receive the death penalty, or a minimum of life without parole, if  convicted. Even if jurors acquit Lynch on grounds that he was insane, he could  be committed to a state hospital for life.  </P></p>

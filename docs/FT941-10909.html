			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / Survey of Emerging Markets (17): Lenient but lopsided - Argentina Argentina now has one of the world's most open and least-regulated financial markets. This, plus a fast-growing economy and the pegging of the peso at par to the dollar, has drawn flight capital back to Argentina and attracted genuinely foreign money into the equity, debt and banking systems. The government has removed nearly all investment barriers, to encourage development of the capital markets and finance economic growth. The Argentine economy has grown by over a quarter since reform began in earnest in 1991, and is expected to expand at 5-6 per cent a year for the next six years. The Buenos Aires Stock Exchange's market capitalisation has doubled in less than a year to over Dollars 33bn, the result both of rising share prices and flotation of big privatised utilities. Most analysts expect prices to continue rising, though perhaps not at the same rate as last year's 36.5 per cent rise in the Merval market index. They forecast above-average growth for sectors like construction, food, energy, cars and banking. Entering, trading and leaving the market is straightforward. Argentina has no exchange controls. Investors need not register with the government. Brokers' commissions are not fixed, and vary between 0.5 and 1 per cent, plus a 0.12 per cent stock exchange levy. Capital gains and dividends are not taxed. There is no stamp duty. Companies are not subject to foreign ownership limits. No sectors are closed to foreigners. Settlement and custody is handled by the exchange's computerised Caja de Valores settlement system. Users say it is reliable and cheap. Although most investors obviously like light regulation, there is concern that the market's existing insider trading, disclosure and reporting rules are poorly enforced. The Comision Nacional de Valores, the capital markets watchdog, rejects the complaints and points to substantially increased fines for offences and more aggressive policing. The market may have grown strongly, but it is still heavily lopsided: five stocks account for three-quarters of market capitalisation. There are no marketmakers, so liquidity in all but the largest companies is limited. The bulk of trading in the largest stocks, such as the semi-privatised oil company YPF or the two privatised telephone operators, has moved to New York, where they are listed in ADR form. Although a dozen companies have listed since the market took off three years ago, just as many have delisted. Most of the departing companies were small and illiquid, with small floats. The listing of big privatisation stocks and a few private industrial companies, such as the carmaker Sevel (licensee of Peugeot and Fiat) and fast-growing Pepsi bottler Baesa, has made the market increasingly representative of the economy. Most companies are majority-owned by families, and still prefer raising debt to selling equity. Hyperinflation virtually eliminated debt, leaving companies room to borrow. This may change as gearing reaches international levels, forcing owners to choose between listing, merging or selling to larger competitors. The lure of equity may increase with the launch in July of private pension funds. At the moment, institutional investors are conspicuous by their absence. Foreign investment funds and institutional investors are increasingly important. Deregulation makes it hard to measure the foreign presence, but foreigners probably account for 20-30 per cent of the market float. Political risk is considered small. President Carlos Menem's decisive handling of rioting in December calmed investors' nerves. Devaluation before next year's presidential elections is ruled out by most analysts. Mr Menem - who wants to lift the constitution's ban on re-election and stand for a second term - appears too committed to reform to backtrack. Economy minister Domingo Cavallo, the architect of Argentina's reforms, is entrenched in power. However, commitment to reform still does not extend much beyond the economy ministry or the Casa Rosada presidential palace.</p>

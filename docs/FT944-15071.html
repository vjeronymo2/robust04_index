			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / CBI warns employers to cut unit labour costs Employers must rein back unit labour costs if the UK is to compete effectively with Germany and the US on global markets, the Confederation of British Industry said yesterday. Mr Howard Davies, the CBI's director-general, said that the UK's rivals were 'now moving ahead again' in achieving better unit labour costs. He pointed out that UK unit labour costs had fallen 1 per cent in the 12 months to the summer of this year, while Germany's had declined by 3 per cent and those of the US by 2 per cent. 'We are not out of the woods yet,' he added, in spite of low inflation and rising profits and investment levels. Output was only back to 1989 levels and the UK's investment rate was well behind those of most other countries, 'as is our productivity', Mr Davies said. The CBI's increasing concern about unit labour costs has been reinforced by the findings of its latest pay and performance review carried out for the CBI by Ernst &amp; Young, the consultants. This says there has been an 'upward creep in pay settlements' as total earnings have overtaken productivity since the middle of last year. This has contributed to 'higher levels of earnings increases' in the UK compared with the country's main competitors. The report adds that UK labour productivity is still low - 40 per cent below that of the US and between 10 per cent and 16 per cent less than in Germany and Japan. Mr Michael Kaltz, partner at Ernst &amp; Young, said: 'The pressures now facing employers are enormous.' The report warns British employees 'are increasingly conscious that the pendulum is beginning to swing in their direction' with the economic recovery while their take-home pay is being squeezed by tax increases. The survey urges employers to keep down their non-wage labour costs as well as the level of pay deals.</p>

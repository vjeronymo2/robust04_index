			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / International Company News: Investors welcome US brokers' performance MERRILL LYNCH and PaineWebber, two of the biggest securities houses in the US, reported strong third- quarter profits despite the slowdown in stock market activity over the summer. At both firms, big increases in earnings from capital market trading - some of it linked to the turmoil in European currency markets last month - and investment banking helped offset the impact of poorly-performing domestic stock markets. The figures delighted investors, with Merrill closing up Dollars 3 1/2 at Dollars 51 1/2 and PaineWebber Dollars 1 1/2 at Dollars 18 1/2 on the New York Stock Exchange. Merrill announced a 44 per cent improvement in third-quarter profits to Dollars 230.1m, or Dollars 2.05 a share. It was a record performance for the period, but still below the record Dollars 277.5m earned in the opening three months of the year. The biggest contribution to profits came from Merrill's trading for its own account, where gains from foreign exchange, swaps and other derivatives boosted revenues 26 per cent to a record Dollars 610m. Investment banking was also strong between July and September, with revenues rising 25 per cent to Dollars 365m. Asset management and custodial fees climbed 11 per cent to Dollars 212m, with assets under management at the firm also up 11 per cent, to Dollars 135bn. Commission revenues rose 8 per cent to Dollars 563m, while net interest income jumped sharply to Dollars 252m and expenses rose 14 per cent to Dollars 1.4bn. It was a similar picture at PaineWebber, where net income rose 35 per cent to Dollars 51.7m, or Dollars 1.06 a share, following healthy increases in revenues from investment banking, brokerage commissions, asset management and principal transactions. Charles Schwab, a discount broking firm, reported a 41 per cent decline in third-quarter profits to Dollars 7.8m due to a slowdown in investor activity.</p>

			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (Briefcase): Attorneys' powers MY WIFE and I are pensioners and we propose to execute Enduring Powers of Attorney reciprocally on the prescribed forms to provide general authorities to act if either of us becomes mentally incapable. We own the freehold of our home as joint tenants, subject to a mortgage. Is there any special authority required in the Powers to include our joint-ownership of our home? There is no special authority required to enable the donee of an enduring power of attorney to act as such for one of two (or more) joint tenants. The power must, of course, state that it is related to interests in land eg. by stating that it relates to all the property and affairs of the donor. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

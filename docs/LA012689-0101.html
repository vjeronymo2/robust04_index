			<p><P> January 26, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ILLNESS KEEPS BATEMAN, LEWIS OUT OF SUNKIST TRACK MEET  </P> <P> Morgan Bateman and Brent Lewis of Crescenta Valley High were forced to withdraw  from last Friday's Sunkist Invitational at the Sports Arena because of illness,  according to Falcon track Coach Keith Gilliland.  </P> <P> Bateman, the defending Southern Section 4-A Division champion in the 800  meters, contracted the flu 2 days before the meet and Lewis, who tied for  second in the pole vault in last spring's Southern Section finals, was  sidelined with mononucleosis.  </P> <P> "The doctor advised us to keep Brent out of the meet," Gilliland said. "He said  if he jumped, there was a chance of rupturing his spleen."  </P> <P> Lewis, who cleared 14 feet, 6 inches as a junior, is expected to be sidelined  for another 3 to 4 weeks. Bateman could resume training later this week.  </P> <P> Bateman, who has a personal best of 1:52.66 in the 800 and ran faster than 1:54  in 5 races last season, may concentrate on the 1,500 this season.  </P> <P> "In the past, Morgan always said he was strictly an 800 runner," Gilliland  said. "But this year, he's talking about possibly moving up to the 1,500.  That's the event that he's best suited for."  </P> <P> Bateman finished eighth in last year's state championships at 800 meters and is  the state's fourth-fastest returning runner in that event. He ran a best of  3:59.58 in the 1,500 as a junior.  </P></p>

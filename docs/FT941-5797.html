			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Micro Focus 4% down and shares fall further Micro Focus, the Berkshire-based software house which has seen its share price plummet from Pounds 30 to less than Pounds 10 in 12 months, reported a 4.4 per cent decline in pre-tax profits for the year to January 31 despite higher sales. The shares fell a further 30p to 970p. About 20 per cent of the company's stock is held as ADRs and it reports in both sterling and dollars. Pre-tax profits came to Pounds 21.8m (Pounds 22.8m), or Dollars 32.5m (Dollars 38.5m). Sales were Pounds 83.8m (Pounds 68.9m), a 21.6 per cent rise in sterling but only 5.8 per cent in dollars. Earnings, fully diluted, were 101.2p (106.5p). In keeping with US practice for high technology companies, Micro Focus does not pay a dividend, preferring to reinvest in the company. It spends about 19 per cent of revenues on research and development. Micro Focus develops and markets software tools which make it easier for programmers to write software. It has a special expertise in Cobol, the commonest computer language for business applications. Mr Paul O'Grady, chairman, said costs had been on budget while sales had lagged, resulting in an earnings shortfall. 'This was caused by less than planned sales of our products for development of MVS applications on IBM mainframes.' These products represented about 50 per cent of the company's business. The problem was that customers were confused over the future of mainframe computers. Mr O'Grady said that sales of the company's pc networking tools were growing at more than 340 per cent a year. COMMENT The share price has been traditionally heavily influenced by US shareholders who are both more knowledgeable and more volatile than UK investors, but there is no disguising the City's irritation with Micro Focus. Despite its proven ability to develop excellent software tools while keeping tight control of overheads, the company somehow fails to inspire confidence. Management is being strengthened, however, by the return of Mr Brian Reynolds, a founder, as joint chief executive with Mr O'Grady. The real question is: how much life remains in the mainframe applications market? Data processing is subject to fads and fashion but both mainframes and Cobol are probably safe for the foreseeable future. While customers make up their minds, however, Micro Focus may have problems returning to growth. Earnings are likely to be flat next year. The p/e is an undemanding 9.3, however, and there should be value in the interest shown in the company's pc networking tools.</p>

			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / As They Say in Europe: Why Britain needs Britosceptics According to those in Britain known as 'Eurosceptics' there is, all over the European Union, some kind of nationalistic undercurrent which needs only to be aroused from its present slumber to recognise the threat posed by Brussels imperialism. The trouble is that there is no single rallying call that could unite Eurosceptics of the world. In France an article by Maurice Allais, the French Nobel prize winner for economics, in Le Figaro a couple of weeks ago, made it clear where his country's anxieties lay. 'France should not have accepted a laisser faire Europe,' he wrote. There should be a Europe that could protect the Union's social achievements. The poorest in the land could not be deprived of work by a bunch of Asiatics. There was a shortage of evidence to back the argument. So here is some: France's imports from developing countries in Asia accounted for 7 per cent of its imports in 1992. The trade deficit with Asia was one third of 1 per cent of gross national product. Amazing how that can destroy whole sectors of French industry and wipe out 2m jobs. Allais' Euroscepticism is hard to reconcile with that of those on Britain's Conservative nationalistic right who see a commitment to anything beyond a free trade area as treason. (The paradox is odd: Conservative nationalism historically has not been associated with free trade. Nationalism itself is the antithesis of market liberalism which should include the free movement of labour.) Each country has its European agenda. And each has its anti-Europeans who disagree with anti-Europeans elsewhere. In Austria, which is about to join the Union, Der Standard asked the public what areas needed most protection. 'Sovereignty' was not mentioned. The only thing that mattered to more than half those polled was the need to keep freight off the road and put it on to rail. The British, and occasionally the French, define the European challenge in abstract terms such as 'sovereignty'. For the rest, European questions centre on practical arrangements for tariffs, lorries and workplace problems. The British would say that Brussels overrides national sovereignty in these areas, but for continental Europeans, the concept is meaningless. It melts in your hand the moment you grasp it. In theory Austria could exercise its sovereignty in the matter of transit freight, in practice that is scarcely credible. The British alone believe that separate choices can be made, that untrammelled independence is obtainable. So why, then, the fuss in Germany about its choice of president this week? If a national government has so little power, how can voting for a powerless president matter? The election of Roman Herzog as president of Germany generated even more soul-searching than is normal at this epicentre of world soul-searching. The Suddeutsche Zeitung ruminated at length. 'Is it really true that the united German people are content, after the uniform-and-murder fetishist A. H, to welcome a fresh, new bourgeois-democratic president every five years? Is there not a craving for a bit of Konig, Kaiser, Gloriavictoria?' The answer was revealing: 'Looking back we must sigh with relief: we were lucky. The German people, Hitler-less thanks to others, were never asked.' A constitution was imposed and so: 'Now our crowned heads can be stolen from us - we remain experienced and knowledgeable and on balance comfortable with our presidents.' Since the Germans have such a cosy concept of their state and its leaders, it is not surprising that they do not fear for its existence. It is much easier to undermine a palace than a suburban villa. The British possess so much 'Queen, Parliament, Gloriavictoria' that the power of Brussels is seen as subversive. One would think from some of this week's pronouncements that the freedom to install seat belts in busses was part of Magna Carta. The concept of Britishness is concentrated on the structure of the state. The nation's great traditions are not to be found in simple, popular matters such as food, drink, dress and useful manufactured goods. Even so-called common law is impenetrable to the common man. So it is that any infringement of the rights of political institutions seems to destroy the very heart of nationhood. Remove the Crown and the power of Westminster and out goes everything from the state opening of parliament to Royal Ascot. Remove its equivalents in Germany, France or Italy, little is lost and much might be gained. Britain needs some Britosceptics rather than Eurosceptics.

			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HARRY CAUDILL; INSPIRED WAR ON POVERTY  </P> <P> Author Harry M. Caudill, whose book "Night Comes to the Cumberlands" helped  inspire President Lyndon B. Johnson's war on poverty, shot himself to death  Thursday in view of the mountains he loved so fiercely. He was 68.  </P> <P> Caudill shot himself in the head, said Edison Banks Jr., the assistant  commonwealth's attorney of Letcher County.  </P> <P> Caudill was pronounced dead about 3 1/2 hours later at Whitesburg Appalachian  Regional Hospital.  </P> <P> "He did it in typical Harry style," said Banks, a former student of Caudill's.  "He was looking at the mountains and shot himself once in the temple area."  </P> <P> Pat Gish, a friend of Caudill's, said the writer had Parkinson's disease. "It  was the result of a long struggle with poor health," said Gish, who publishes  The Mountain Eagle newspaper in Whitesburg with her husband, Tom.  </P> <P> A retired lawyer and state legislator, Caudill taught Appalachian history for  eight years at the University of Kentucky until 1985.  </P> <P> Caudill is best known for his 1963 book, "Night Comes to the Cumberlands," an  expose of poverty in Appalachia.  </P> <P> The book so vividly described Appalachia's problems that it brought the region  into the national spotlight. President Johnson subsequently backed an array of  social programs designed to develop the region and improve living standards for  its people.  </P> <P> Caudill vividly described environmental problems caused by strip mining,  criticized absentee landowners and preached to improve the region's schools. He  was widely admired for taking courageous stands against injustice despite huge  obstacles and a hostile political climate.  </P> <P> By last spring, Caudill had written 10 books, 80 essays and editorials and  about 50 magazine articles protesting injustices faced by Appalachian  residents.  </P></p>

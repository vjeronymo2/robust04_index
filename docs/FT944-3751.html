			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / Directors with bonuses 'get more in basic pay' Managing directors who receive bonuses get more in basic pay than those with no bonuses, according to a salary survey published today. The report, by the Reward Group and the Institute of Directors, found that in parent companies managing directors receiving no bonus pay received Pounds 60,000 on average in annual basic pay. Managing directors in similar companies who received bonuses - of Pounds 15,000 a year on average - had a higher average basic pay of Pounds 72,000. The same phenomenon was apparent in single companies and in subsidiaries. The report said: 'The conventional wisdom prior to undertaking this research was that those who do not have any additional pay would generally have a higher basic salary. This is demonstrably not the case.' The IoD said it was unable to shed light on the apparent discrepancy other than to suggest that high performing directors, already on high salaries, might be in the best postion to demand profit-related bonuses. The survey of 5,000 directors across a broad range of company sizes said annual pay increases for directors averaged 3 per cent in the past 12 months. This is substantially less than the findings of other recent surveys, most of which were putting the pay rises of directors, managers and executives in the past year at about 6 per cent. More than half of the respondents to the latest survey had pay rises of 3 per cent or less with 17 per cent having no rise. Only 1 per cent had a pay cut. Most directors forecast pay rises of 3 per cent in the next 12 months although 10 per cent of them expected to get no increases. Mr Tim Melville-Ross, director-general of the IoD, said the survey put directors' pay rises into perspective. He said: 'It confirms that the high profile salaries and rises are not representative and give the wrong impression about directors' salaries and pay rises.' Directors' Rewards.

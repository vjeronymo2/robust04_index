			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Financial Planning): Helping the shopaholics  -Lucy Kellaway explains how What is a shopaholic? Shopaholics are people who buy things they do not need or even want, mainly for the thrill of it. They do it in a repeated, uncontrolled way that distinguishes them from everyday people who sometimes buy things on impulse to cheer themselves up. Why do they do it? Some are unhappy and have low self-esteem. Others do it to overcome bouts of depression. A few are motivated by boredom; others by the sheer fun of buying. Is it increasing? There are no precise figures available but Lancaster University's Richard Elliott believes all the major contributing factors are rising. These include availability of credit; disposable income; and advertising that makes you believe you will become a better, happier person from buying something. Does it have side-effects? Many shopaholics feel extreme guilt and anxiety. Most also have the stress of carrying a heavy secret, as few are prepared to discuss the problem. What help is there? There are two debt advice services to which they can turn: the National Debt Line in Birmingham, and the Consumer Credit Counselling Service in Leeds. Most shopaholics have their credit cards taken away before they are threatened with bankruptcy (although it ends that way for some). But, as Miranda (whose case was reported on page 1) found, an Individual Voluntary Arrangement can be a better option through being more discreet and, often, allowing repayment in a way the debtor can afford. An IVA involves getting 75 per cent of creditors to agree to a schedule of payments they believe is both reasonable and achievable. In Miranda's case, it meant paying off 25 per cent of the debt over three years. Are shopaholics a major problem for card companies? Recent research from the Policy Studies Institute shows that 18 per cent of those who defaulted on credit card repayments in 1992 had spent too much. Of these, about half were over-spent because of a drop in income; less than 8 per cent were in default through profligate spending. The report said three things would help reduce the level of bad debts: Card companies should: 1. Appraise the behaviour and creditworthiness of existing clients continually, rather than just at the start. 2. Be more selective about increasing credit ceilings. At the moment, increases are too automatic. 3. Have access to more information about clients at the outset. At present, credit rating agencies have details only of county court judgments - not how much the client owes other creditors.</p>

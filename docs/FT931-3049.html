			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Red Bood Details): Full fund changes outlined THE GOVERNMENT'S full fund policy helps to ensure that its borrowing is financed in a non-inflationary way and provides markets and investors with an indication of the scale of funding the authorities are likely to undertake year by year. Under the present definition the net total of maturing debt, the PSBR and any underlying increase in the foreign exchange reserves has been met by sales of debt to purchasers other than banks and building societies. Under the present definition, if banks and building societies seek to increase their own liquidity by buying gilts, the government has to sell more debt. This is not appropriate when demand for credit is weak and the growth of the private sector's liquidity is subdued. Moreover, this process drains cash from the money markets, increasing the need for the authorities to provide money market assistance and for the banks and building societies to part with the liquid assets that are acquired in those official operations. As a result, the ability of banks and building societies to increase their total liquidity is constrained; and the task of managing the provision of money market assistance is made more complicated. The government intends to continue the full fund policy but from now on to allow sales of debt to banks and building societies to count as funding, in the same way as sales of debt to other sectors. As before, sales of Treasury bills will not count as funding, and no change is envisaged in the practice whereby current coupon gilts below three years' maturity are not issued other than in exceptional circumstances, reflecting the policy's unchanged objectives. The policy will be operated in a symmetrical way. When banks and building societies are net buyers of government debt, total debt sales will be lower than under the present specification. But when banks and building societies are net sellers, total debt sales will be higher. Over a period of years this will not change the total amount of debt sales, except to the extent that there is a long-term trend in bank and building society holdings. This change will take effect from 1993-94.</p>

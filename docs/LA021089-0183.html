			<p><P> February 10, 1989, Friday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> PLACENTIA'S CHANG OUT OF TOURNEY  </P> <P> Michael Chang withdrew today from the $350,000 Volvo Chicago tennis tournament  after hurting his ankle the previous night in a match with Jimmy Connors.  Sixteen-year-old Chang, of Placentia, was to have faced Argentina's Horatio De  La Pena in one of four quarterfinal matches later today.  </P> <P> Chang beat Connors 6-3, 7-6, 7-2 in the second-round match Thursday night.  "I've played against (Ivan) Lendl, (John) McEnroe and (Henri) LeConte, but  playing a legend and beating him is not only a thrill, but an honor," he said  afterward.  </P></p>

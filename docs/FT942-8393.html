			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Capital Radio sharply up at Pounds 12m - Advance at the London music station is expected to herald a general upturn in the industry An increasing share of advertising revenue for radio and growing confidence in the industry were the reasons cited for a marked improvement in profits at Capital Radio, the flagship station of UK commercial radio. The London music station, reported pre-tax profits up from Pounds 4.65m to Pounds 12.5m on increased turnover of Pounds 23.6m (Pounds 14.1m) in the six months to end-March. This year's figure however, includes an exceptional gain of Pounds 4.1m made from the sale of a number of radio stations in the east Midlands. Earnings per share emerged at 13.9p (4.6p) - or 8.1p stripping out exceptionals - and the interim dividend is increased by 29 per cent to 2.25p (1.75p). Analysts believe that other large radio groups, such as GWR and Metro, are also likely to report rising profits. Mr Ian Irvine, the chairman of Capital, said yes-terday: 'the upturn in confidence in the radio advertising market which began in the second half of 1993 has been sustained'. Costs had been kept under tight control, Mr Irvine said, while there had been increased investment in sales and marketing to take advantage of the upturn. The main underlying factor behind the results was that after 12 years in which radio's share of total advertising scarcely moved, in 1993 it grew from 2.8 per cent of display advertising to 3.4 per cent for a total of Pounds 179m. It also benefited from Midlands stations acquired in April 1993. Mr Richard Eyre, managing director of Capital, said he was optimistic that the station, which has to reapply for its two eight-year London licences next month, would be unopposed. Four new London-wide licences were attracting all the interest. Mr Eyre promised yesterday that if a new national FM licence, now under consideration, is advertised next year Capital would bid for it. The company is within a couple of weeks of completing its agreed Pounds 32.6m takeover of Southern Radio and planned to launch a new station for Eastbourne and Hastings, an area which takes its main service from Brighton at present. 'Radio is quite a fashionable medium now,' said Mr Eyre, who used to work in advertising in the days when commercial radio got only the money left over from other campaigns. The shares closed at 407p, up 2p on the day. COMMENT The improvement at Capital represents a fundamental shift in how commercial radio is perceived as a medium and is likely to be replicated by other well-run groups. For the full year Capital is likely to have pre-tax profits of between Pounds 17m and Pounds 18m, although with four new London stations on the way the competition can only intensify. Large established stations such as Capital - its services are first and second in London - just benefit disproportionately if a rise in advertising share continues. For the first time a 5 per cent share of total advertising no longer looks like a pipe dream. However, the shares have already doubled in the past year and at 23 times this year's earnings they fully reflect the profits potential.</p>

			<p><P> September 17, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> BUSINESS INTERESTS 1ST  </P> <P> By casting the only vote against changing the historic name of Elm Avenue  (circa 1886) to hard-sell "Carlsbad Village Drive," Councilman John Mamaux  showed again what a shrewd politician he has become. I predict this street name  change will be among the most unpopular decisions this council has made.  </P> <P> Incredibly, the other council members all spoke in favor of spending $143,000  of city funds (property taxes from the redevelopment area) for the stated  purpose of attracting more traffic onto Elm -- "to help the downtown  merchants."  </P> <P> As anyone who still uses Elm knows, it already violates growth-management  traffic standards. And as the council should know, their own traffic studies  indicate it will continue to do so after the street-widening project is  complete.  </P> <P> If there was ever a doubt this council puts the commercial interests of the  business community ahead of the interests of Carlsbad residents, this tacky  sellout of honorable old Elm should settle it once and for all.  </P> <P> S.A. STATHAM  </P> <P> Carlsbad  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 26 (XINHUA) -- Russian Prime Minister  V.S. Chernomyrdin and his party arrived here by special plane  this morning.    Chernomyrdin is here for a four-day official visit to China  at the invitation of his Chinese counterpart Li Peng.    This is the first-ever visit to China by a Russian prime  minister.    He Guangyuan, chairman of the Chinese Government Reception  Committee and minister of the machine-building industry, and  Deputy Foreign Minister Dai Bingguo greeted the Russian guests  at the airport.    In a brief interview with Russia's ITAR-TASS and China's  XINHUA news agencies at the airport, Chernomyrdin said his visit  is a follow-up to President Yeltsin's 1992 trip to China.    A large number of Russian Government ministers, experts and  entrepreneurs are accompanying Chernomyrdin. A batch of  co-operation documents are expected to be signed by the two  governments, Chernomyrdin said.    "Russia and China are two traditionally friendly neighbors,"  he said. "The two countries should maintain and further enhance  their normal and friendly relations."    The Russian prime minister wished the friendship between the  two peoples further progress and the Chinese people a happy life.    Russian Deputy Prime Minister Shokhin, who arrived here  earlier, and Russian Ambassador to China Rogachev were among  those at the airport to greet Chernomyrdin and his party.    According to his schedule, Chernomyrdin will visit the  Forbidden City and the Great Wall today.    This afternoon Chinese Premier Li Peng will host a welcoming  ceremony in his honor.</p>

			<p><P> November 13, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLF ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> COODY ENDS 16-YEAR DROUGHT WITH PLAYOFF WIN  </P> <P> Charles Coody sank a six-foot birdie putt on the second hole of sudden death to  earn his first victory in three years on the Senior Tour, winning the Las Vegas  tournament Sunday at the Desert Inn Country Club.  </P> <P> It was also the first win of any kind in 16 years for Coody. His last victory  came on the PGA European Tour in 1973.  </P> <P> Coody, who entered the final round one stroke ahead of Al Geiberger and Tom  Shaw, beat out Bob Charles and Chi Chi Rodriguez after shooting an 11-under-par  205 in regulation.  </P> <P> He shot a bogey-free 69 and used a key save of par on the final hole of  regulation to forge his way into his first professional playoff.  </P> <P> All three players parred the first playoff hole before Rodriguez's 30-foot  birdie chip from the fringe at the next hole glanced off the pin and stopped  inches away. Charles then left a 20-foot birdie putt on the left lip.  </P> <P> Coody responded by sinking his six-footer from below the hole. He earned  $45,000 for the win.  </P> <P> Rodriguez might have won had he pulled the pin from the cup instead of leaving  it in on the second playoff hole. The ball, headed for the middle of the cup,  hit the pin lightly and bounced inches away.  </P> <P> Charles also had a chance at victory as he stood 12 feet from birdie on the  first playoff hole but left the shot for his sixth victory of the season inches  short. It was his bogey in regulation at the par-5 15th hole that first hurt  his chances, however.  </P> <P> Finishing third was Dave Hill at 207. Al Geiberger, who won at Las Vegas in  1987, was next at 209.  </P> <P> Charles and Rodriguez earned $24,625 each for placing second in the $300,000  tournament.  </P> <P> Peter Senior of Australia recovered from a double bogey at the 14th hole to  beat Jim Benepe and win the Australian PGA championship in Sydney, Australia.  </P> <P> Senior, who was tied with Benepe going into the final round, carded a  one-under-par 71 to win by one stroke after Benepe three-putted the final hole  to end up with a par-72.  </P> <P> Jose-Maria Olazabal of Spain shot a 67 for a 13-under-par 203 total and  three-stroke victory in a rain-shortened tournament in Japan.  </P> <P> Isao Aoki, who tied the course record with a 65, tied for second with Naomichi  Ozaki at 206. Barry Lane of Britain eagled the 18th hole for the second time in  the tournament to tie Ken Green and Nobuo Serizawa for fourth place at 207.  </P></p>

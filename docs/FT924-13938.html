			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / Leading Article: VAT headache WILL THE taxman spoil the celebrations when the single European market comes into being at midnight on December 31? It seems likely that complex new value added tax (VAT) rules for intra-European Community trade will leave thousands of businesses around Europe with a corporate headache. The problem arises because the abolition of customs checks at borders has brought about changes to the VAT rules and to procedures for collecting trade statistics. Companies will take over responsibility for administering VAT and gathering trade data. Not only are the details of the changes highly complex, they are also being rushed through in a very tight timescale. The implications may not have been fully thought through and businesses have very little time to adjust. The new rules are an uncomfortable compromise between the present 'destination' system, which taxes goods at the import stage, and a fully fledged 'origin' arrangement, which taxes goods when they leave the factory gate, to be introduced in 1997. The transitional system was needed because EC governments could not agree on a closer harmonisation of VAT rates (the UK, for example, might have had to drop zero-rating for children's clothes and many food items). There were also doubts about the ability of some governments to operate the clearing house for VAT payments which would have been needed. There is little that can be done at this late stage to modify the proposed transitional system, though business organisations must start now to plan for 1997. Companies should give a higher priority at board level to preparing for the new regime, and concentrate the efforts of their computer experts on the complex modifications required. The customs authorities have indicated that they will be understanding of genuine lapses by companies but in the UK, at least, Customs &amp; Excise has gained a reputation for hard dealing. Customs needs to be properly understanding of the real problems businesses will have to face. Business organisations, for their part, must do more to make their voices heard in Brussels. If they had taken early, effective action when the VAT rules were under discussion they might not need to be so vociferous now. Finally, ministers must take greater account of the needs of business when approving legislation. The European idea has fallen out of favour with many ordinary voters. The last thing the Community now needs is to alienate businesses as well.</p>

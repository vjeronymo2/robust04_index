			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Tax chiefs act over Tessa trap WHEN Deacon Hoare, the Bristol-based banking institution, was placed in liquidation on June 10, depositors with tax-exempt special savings accounts (Tessas) were left bewildered. Most of the 200 depositors with Deacon Hoare had opened Tessas there, attracted by the exceptionally high interest rates being quoted - 15.87 per cent on February 9 1991, for example. The next highest rate, out of more than 110 accounts on offer, was 15.5 per cent while the average at that time was below 14 per cent. Tessas are covered by the Bank of England's deposit protection scheme, which ensures that depositors get compensation of up to 75 per cent of Pounds 20,000. But what has been less clear is whether this 75 per cent should also cover interest that would have accrued. The problem is caused because interest on a Tessa is tax-free only if the capital is left untouched for the full five-year term. Deacon Hoare was liquidated before that period, so the question arises: should investors be compensated for the interest that would have been earned had the Tessa run its normal course? This question was asked by an FT reader who has been shuffled between the deposit protection board, Deacon Hoare, its liquidators, and another bank to which he hoped to transfer the Tessa. He had placed the maximum amounts allowable by depositing Pounds 3,000 in the first year of the Tessa and another Pounds 1,800 this year. By the end of March this year, he noticed that Deacon Hoare had dropped the interest rate on its Tessa by more than 1.5 per cent, which pushed it below that paid by most institutions. When he tried to transfer his Tessa to another bank, he was told by Deacon Hoare he would have to wait a calendar month before he could do so. By the time the cheque for Pounds 5,509.40 - including the accrued interest  -was received by the other bank, Deacon Hoare had gone into liquidation, leaving our reader in limbo. The Bank of England and the Inland Revenue have now reached agreement on what should be done about Tessa compensation. Victims of a collapsed institution with a Tessa will have a choice. One option is for them to take compensation of 75 per cent of their Tessa. This amount would comprise the capital and accrued interest up to the date the institution went into liquidation. This is despite rules under which gross interest normally cannot be paid before five years. But a Revenue spokesman explained: 'These people will have lost more than they earned in interest, so we are writing off tax on that interest.' Alternatively, investors who want to continue holding a Tessa can do so by opening an account at another bank. This would be regarded as a transfer for tax purposes. The 75 per cent compensation for the original investment and accrued interest would be paid into this account, and the Tessa would expire five years after it was first opened with the collapsed institution. So far, so good. The bad news is that the investor will not be allowed to top up the Tessa to the full amount for that year. In other words, if our reader - whose Tessa balance stood at Pounds 5,509.40 on the day Deacon Hoare went into liquidation - wants to transfer it, compensation of 75 per cent of this amount (Pounds 4,132.05) will be paid into the new account. But the Revenue says he will not be allowed to top this up to Pounds 5,509.40 because he would have already paid in the maximum Pounds 1,800 deposit allowed in year two. What makes this situation particularly anomalous is that, in certain circumstances, the full amount could be transferred. If our reader held another account at Deacon Hoare with, say, Pounds 5,000 in it, he would receive a single cheque for Pounds 7,882.05, comprising 75 per cent of Pounds 5,000 and the Tessa compensation. He would be able to transfer Pounds 5,509.40 of this amount into the Tessa at the new bank or building society. The Revenue says this is because such a transfer would not involve any violation of the Tessa rules - an additional deposit to that allowed for the year is not being made. It also says that investors with more than one account in a collapsed bank will have lost proportionately more than those holding a single account. 'We are trying to bend over backwards to be helpful,' said the spokesman. 'However, we do not think we can go further than this in the Tessa tax rules.'</p>

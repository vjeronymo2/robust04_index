			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / International Bonds: Spain lifts yield on Eurodollar issue by 10 basis points THE TURMOIL in bond markets of the past fortnight yesterday claimed its latest victim as the Kingdom of Spain was forced to increase the yield on its first Eurodollar bond issue by a substantial 10 basis points. The decision to lift the yield, to 55 basis points over US treasuries against the 42 to 45 basis points mooted when the bonds were first put on sale a week ago, marks the latest climb down among issuers recently. The Kingdom of Spain considered withdrawing its issue as the European Investment Bank and Spintab had been forced to do, but decided instead to proceed at a higher yield. The change in price level raised again the question of the value of underwriting in the Eurobond market. Banks which had underwritten the issue a week before at 45 basis points over treasuries were excused the need to stand behind a price which all agreed would have been a disaster in the secondary market. A sharp rise in spreads in the secondary market on issues of supranational agencies such as the World Bank partly accounted for the need to change the terms. Traders said spreads on these issues had jumped by around 15 basis points, following a change in their tax treatment in Italy at the end of last week. The bonds ended the day at an unchanged spread of 55 basis points as the lead managers stood behind the issue, picking up paper from other syndicate banks. Meanwhile, yesterday saw a renewed wave of floating rate notes with minimum and maximum yield levels, as the Eurobond market came back to life after the past week of n upheaval. The activity included a well-received Dollars 250m issue from Austria, later raised by Dollars 150m, marking the first sovereign issue in this sector. The second tranche was priced at 100 1/4 after the first had been sold at par, with the bond bid later in day at 100 1/2.</p>

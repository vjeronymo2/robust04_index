			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / International Company News: Vard shares fall on strategy fear SHARES in Vard, the Norwegian ferry and cruise group, have tumbled by nearly 20 per cent on the Oslo bourse since Monday following reports that its board is divided over a strategy to break up the group, writes Karen Fossli in Oslo. Vard was also hit by a gloomy forecast from Alfred Berg, a Scandinavian analyst, which Vard executives rejected as unfounded. Vard shares closed down NKr2 to NKr29.50 (Dollars 4.33) in Oslo yesterday, having started the week at NKr37. The decline has also been spurred by the rejection of an offer of more than NKr1bn by a group of investors, led by a Vard board member, to acquire the ferry business. Talks are said to be still under way. Analysts said Vard's board was split over selling the ferry business, which generates earnings, before disposing of the cruise business. Vard's cruise business accounts for the greatest portion of overall group debt. The company has repeatedly denied that it has financial problems, but has said that it was working on its companies' financing in order to secure a debt maturity profile more in accordance with the life expectancy of their cruise and ferry fleets.</p>

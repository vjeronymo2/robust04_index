			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / G7 faces hard time to keep the lid on the Dollars: FT reporters look at the likelihood of upsets this week in world currency markets The Group of Seven leading industrial nations has 11 days to stop the dollar drama turning into a crisis. As G7 leaders approach their annual summit in Naples at the end of next week, they want to avoid any perception in financial markets they are unable to arrest the fall against the D-Mark and Japanese yen of the world's leading trading currency. But on the evidence of last week the G7 - US, Japan, Germany, France, Italy, Britain and Canada - will have its work cut out. Heavy intervention on Friday by most of the G7 central banks, backed by central banks in other European countries, failed to lift the dollar from its lacklustre position against other main currencies. On Friday night in New York the dollar closed at Y100.525 against the yen and DM1.584 against the D-Mark, below the levels at which the central banks first intervened earlier that day. Since the first week of June, the dollar has slipped about 5 yen - last week briefly passing under Y100 - and 8 pfennigs. Many investors believe Friday's efforts to buy dollars led by the US Federal Reserve will have to be repeated early this week, perhaps today, in a further show of strength to prop the ailing currency. But in both the US and Europe, currency analysts said negative sentiment toward the dollar had taken root. 'I don't think anyone wants to hold a buck right now,' said a dealer at a Japanese bank in New York. Mr Stephen Lewis, research director at London Bond Broking, a securities dealer, said: 'The dominant mood in the market is that the dollar has further to fall.' Behind these thoughts is that the Fed is judged unwilling to consider a rise in short-term interest rates to defend the dollar. Such a move could jeopardise the US recovery, the main drive behind signs of stronger economic conditions throughout the industrialised world. Meanwhile, the perception has grown that the Bundesbank is unlikely to continue cutting short-term borrowing rates, because of signs of economic pick-up in Germany. As a result, many think the gap between short-term interest rates in Germany and the US is about to widen, after months of general narrowing. At present three-month interbank rates in Germany are about 4.9 per cent and in the US about 4.6 per cent - the further they move apart the more incentive investors have to hold D-Marks. Also holding back the dollar against the yen is the large Japanese current account surplus with the US and lack of progress in trade talks between the two countries. Mr John Lipsky, chief economist at Salomon Brothers, the US investment bank, said last Friday's intervention had at least succeeded in dispelling doubts about the intention of US authorities and G7 partners to quell currency instability. 'It's hardly the last word: there is likely more action to come,' Mr Lipsky said. But the chances of success of further rounds of intervention are open to question. One European monetary official said much Friday's support for the dollar was 'pretty much token', coming after years of general lack of concern in the US about dollar weakness. 'Unless the Americans back up intervention with a policy action (an increase in interest rates) the moves won't have much impact,' he said. A further question mark can be raised over the willingness of the Bundesbank to join large-scale operations to boost the dollar. Any action by the German central bank to buy dollars for D-Marks risks an increase in the German money supply, playing havoc with the M3 money-supply calculations the bank uses to judge economic conditions. For this reason there is 'general scepticism about the Bundesbank's willingness' to intervene, according to Mr Gerry Holtham, chief European economist at Lehman Brothers. Nervousness over the dollar is expected to continue to spill over to world bond and equity markets, which were fragile last week on fears about how an increase in US interest rates could endanger signs of global economic recovery. Mr Roger Bootle, chief economist at Midland Global Markets, said even if US borrowing rates went up, the same would not necessarily have to happen in Europe. But he added: 'In 13 years I have never seen a situation where the bond markets were more lacking in confidence than they are now.' He said pressure on the dollar was exaggerated by many investors' over-enthusiasm for the US currency last year. They had built up large stocks of dollars and were now keen to sell. And he believed that although Japanese institutional investors had cash to invest, many had seen the value of their overseas holdings whittled away by currency shifts and were no longer prepared to buy foreign exchange assets. 'The Japanese are the buyers of last resort and if they don't come in (to support currencies) this can cause problems,' Mr Bootle said.</p>

This action is necessary to ensure that the origin health certificate contains all of the information required by the foreign country of destination. We are also amending the requirements concerning scrapie for sheep and goats intended for export. This action clarifies the regulations and makes the terminology used in the export regulations consistent with that used in our domestic scrapie regulations. We are also revising one definition in the domestic scrapie regulations to make the definitions in those regulations consistent with each other. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  October 26, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Dr. Najam Faizi, Senior Staff Veterinarian, Import-Export Animals Staff, National Center for Import-Export, Veterinary Services, APHIS, USDA, room 762, Federal Building, 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, MD 20782, (301) 436&hyph;8383.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The regulations in 9 CFR part 91, ``Inspection and Handling of Livestock for Exportation'' (referred to below as the regulations), prescribe conditions for exporting animals from the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On May 13, 1994, we published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (59 FR 24979&hyph;24982, Docket No. 93&hyph;070&hyph;1) a proposal to amend the regulations by providing that United States origin health certificates include all test results, certifications, or other statements required by the foreign country of destination. We also proposed to amend the requirements concerning scrapie for sheep and goats intended for export, in order to clarify the regulations and make the terminology used in the export regulations consistent with that used in the domestic scrapie regulations. Additionally, we proposed to revise a definition in the domestic scrapie regulations to make the definitions in those regulations consistent with each other.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We solicited comments concerning the proposed rule for a 60-day comment period ending July 12, 1994. The one comment we received by that date supported the proposal as written.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, based on the rationale set forth in the proposed rule, we are adopting the provisions of the proposal as a final rule without change.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. The rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866, and, therefore, has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 604, we have performed a Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis regarding the impact of this rule on small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rule requires that the origin health certificate required for animals exported from the United States include any test results, certifications, or other statements required by the foreign country of destination. It also revises the export regulations in 9 CFR part 91 to make them consistent with the regulations in 9 CFR parts 54 and 79 regarding the Voluntary Scrapie Flock Certification Program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No issues were raised by public comments in response to the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis we published in our proposal, and we identified no significant alternatives to this rule. We anticipate that the changes involving certification will have little or no impact on domestic exporters. In order for exporters to sell their animals abroad, the animals must meet the import requirements of the country of destination. Therefore, it is in the exporter's interest to ensure that those requirements are met. This rule change requires only that the origin health certificate include all test results, certifications, or other statements required by the country of destination. However, estimates of the number of animals and the number of small entities that will be affected, and the potential costs to exporters, are not available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The changes to the regulations concerning sheep and goats with regard to scrapie will affect some producers. Under the regulations, sheep and goats from ``source flock'' premises may not be exported. Under the regulations prior to the effective date of this rule, source flock premises are considered those from which an animal affected with scrapie was moved within 18 months or less prior to showing signs of scrapie. Under this rule, the export of sheep and goats from source flocks continues to be prohibited, but the meaning of source flock is revised to mean a flock in which at least two animals were diagnosed as scrapie-positive animals at an age of 54 months or less, provided the second diagnosis was made within 60 months of the first, and provided the requirements of a flock plan have not been completed. This change makes the regulations more restrictive, and may increase the number of animals prohibited exportation because they originated in a source flock. However, as of July 1993, there were only five source flocks in the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12372  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This program/activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under No. 10.025 and is subject to Executive Order 12372, which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials.

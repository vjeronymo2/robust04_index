			<p>BFN     [Text] At 1400 today, the Ministry of Communications  reports, the transmitter relaying Russia's radio on 261 kH on  the longwave will be switched off. This has been caused by an  unpaid electricity bill. It is not for the first time that the  problem of payments has emerged. It is not the company's debt  which is at issue; the funds have not been provided from the  state budget. The Government is intending to consider, in the  nearest future, the problem of state radio and television --  specifically volumes of broadcasting and necessary funding.    We do regret, on our part, that our listeners will be unable  to listen to Russia's Radio on its usual frequency, due to the  fact that these problems are as yet unresolved.</p>

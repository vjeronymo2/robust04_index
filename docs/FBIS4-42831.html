			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Call for High Voter Turnout"] </F>   [Text] Five days before the referendum on Austria's  accession to the European Union [EU], a number of leading Social  Democratic Party of Austria [SPOe] and Austrian People's Party  [OeVP] officials issued appeals. Among others, Federal  Chancellor Franz Vranitzky, Vienna Mayor Helmut Zilk, and  Economics Federation President Leopold Maderthaner, and Johann  Hoechtl, chairman of the OeVP's Workers' and Employees'  Association [OeAAB], appealed to all Austrians to participate in  the referendum this coming Sunday [12 June] and to vote with yes.    Vranitzky asked the EU supporters, in particular, to  exercise  their right to vote. Of course, all citizens should make use of  their democratic right to vote. Asked about the result of the  referendum, Vranitzky said that he did not expect an  overwhelming decision. The result will be clear and  unambiguous, albeit not overwhelming, the chancellor said.    Economics Federation President Leopold Maderthaner and OeAAB  Chairman Josef Hoechtl said that a clear majority was in favor  of EU entry. Yet, the question was whether all these people  would cast their vote on 12 June. For Maderthaner the question  is whether, as of 1995, Austria would belong to West Europe or,  together with Switzerland, to the group of states of the former  East bloc and the former Yugoslavia.    Both officials strongly warned against the threatening loss  of jobs as a result of a negative referendum result. A total of  100,000 jobs were at stake, Hoechtl said: 43,000 new ones by the  end of the century in the case of a positive outcome, or the  loss of 60,000 in the case of a no. As a result of the  rejection of the European Economic Area [EEA] 18 months ago,  150,000 jobs were lost in Switzerland.    Only EU membership can safeguard Austria as a financial  center, Maderthaner emphasized. In the case of a no, a dramatic  slump in investment would have to be feared similarly to  Switzerland, where investment has fallen to a minimum since the  no to the EEA. Maderthaner emphasized that a no in the EU  referendum would also threaten Austria's function as a bridge  to--and center for--the states of the former East bloc.    On the occasion of the 45th-anniversary celebration of the  Lawyers' Association, Justice Minister Nikolaus Michalek  welcomed the fact that the legal aid associations had taken a  clear public position and, after a critical examination, said  "yes" to EU entry.    A study on "European integration under ecological and social  criteria" was presented by the Greens on Tuesday. The study,  which was sponsored by the Greens' think tank and carried out by  the Advisory Council for Economic, Social and Environmental  Alternatives, describes the alternative to the Maastricht Treaty  in terms of economic and monetary policy. The authors  emphasized that the study does not present a clear stand for or  against Austrian EU entry. Madeleine Petrovic, chairwoman of  the Greens caucus in the Austrian Parliament, emphasized that  the question of yes or no on 12 June was beyond the scope of  the study but that one could conclude the necessity for change.  Johannes Voggenhuber, Greens spokesman for European affairs,  emphasized that the Greens doesn't intend to teach the  government a lesson on the day of the referendum, only wants to  "teach the EU a lesson."    Economist Wolfgang Polt said that economic and monetary  union  as envisioned under the Maastricht Treaty, would have positive  effects on growth and cost and eliminate speculation in foreign  currency. However, in his view, the treaty's convergence  criteria are unattainable for most countries within the next  15-40 years. These criteria could be achieved only at the price  of "stabilization crises." The creation of a single currency by  1999 is most unlikely. On Tuesday, the Freedom Party of Austria  [FPOe] strongly criticized the Corrao Pirzio-Biroli, the EU  ambassador to Austria, who said that if Austria were to vote  with no on 12 June, membership would not be renegotiated. FPOe  Chairman Joerg Haider spoke of a Federal Government "EU  blackmailing campaign" along with "foreign helpers and  panicmongers."    The Association of Austrian Doctors has advocated Austrian  EU  entry on conditions that Finance Minister Ferdinand Lacina keeps  his promise that the additional financial burden resulting from  EU entry would be compensated as promised.    On Tuesday, the Council of Catholic Laymen pointed to  solidarity as a basic value of Catholic social teaching. As an  integral part of the EU, Austria could do a lot for the poorer  countries in the world, while as a poorer, isolated country,  Austria could do nothing.    A majority of the provincial government of Lower Austria  decided on Tuesday to recommend a vote in favor of EU entry to  the citizens of the province.</p>

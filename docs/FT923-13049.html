			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / International Company News: Healthy sales help lift Motorola 23% MOTOROLA, the electronics and semiconductor manufacturer, yesterday reported a 23 per cent rise in second-quarter net income, powered by strong sales increases in most of its product areas. The company reported net income of Dollars 146m, or Dollars 1.09 a share, compared with Dollars 119m, or 90 cents, in the same period of last year. Sales rose from Dollars 2.8bn to Dollars 3.14bn. For the six months, the company reported net income of Dollars 273m, or Dollars 2.05 a share, compared with Dollars 235m, or Dollars 1.78, on sales which rose from Dollars 5.56bn to Dollars 6.20bn. Motorola's semiconductor products sales rose 21 per cent to Dollars 1.08bn and operating profits from the section increased. The company said all sales regions experienced strong order growth, apart from Japan. Orders rose most rapidly in the communications, distribution, personal computer/workstation and consumer markets. In communications businesses, sales grew 11 per cent to Dollars 972m and operating profits rose. General systems sales rose 11 per cent to Dollars 821m, but operating profits were flat. Information systems saw sales up to Dollars 160m and made a profit, against a loss a year ago. The automotive and industrial electronics group saw sales 8 per cent higher but operating profits were lower. Motorola said it would be adopting during the fourth quarter a new accounting standard for post retiree health benefits and this was expected to entail an obligation of Dollars 190m to Dollars 300m, which would be recognised immediately.</p>

			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Fiscal Properties seeks Pounds 25m Fiscal Properties is hoping to raise Pounds 25m through a flotation next month. The group invests in commercial properties that are mainly let to the government. The portfolio has grown from a value of Pounds 12.3m at the end of December 1991 to Pounds 52.9m at the end of January this year. A combination of new ordinary shares and convertible unsecured loan stock will be issued. The size of the issues will be announced, along with the pricing, on impact day on Wednesday week. Last year the group reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 247,000 on rental income of Pounds 3.2m. The company was founded by Mr Terry Goddard, chairman and finance director, and Mr Gordon Bloor, chief executive and managing director, in 1985. All its investment properties are outside central London and do not command high rents, a factor which the directors believe leaves it less exposed to downturns. Half the income stream is guaranteed to the year 2006, and all contracts feature upward only rent reviews. After the flotation the group's venture capitalists - Montagu Private Equity, 3i and SO. PA. F of Italy - will hold around 35 per cent of the company. The three are not selling any shares. The two founders will hold 15 to 20 per cent. Mr Goddard will be selling some shares for personal reasons. Sponsor and broker to the issue is Paribas. Dealings are expected to commence on April 15.</p>

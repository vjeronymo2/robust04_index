			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / Observer: Coquettish One outfit certainly not renowned for its readiness to hitch up its skirts at the drop of a share-dealer's hat is the German steel and engineering group, Thyssen. So what are we to make of the company's advertisement in yesterday's Financial Times, inviting 'her shareholders' to next month's annual meeting? One possible explanation lies in Anglo-German (mis)understanding. Perhaps Thyssen's copywriters, with or without the aid of the FT's ad department, simply translated into English the feminine characteristics of the German word 'Aktiengesellschaft'? Then again, of course, the Iron Lady of the Ruhr could have something really sexy in mind for March 19 in Dusseldorf.</p>

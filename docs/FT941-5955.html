			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / PM holds out hope of more troops for Bosnia: United Nations calls for near doubling of ground forces to protect fragile ceasefires Britain yesterday held out the possibility that it might send more troops to Bosnia after the United Nations called on the international community to almost double its forces in the former Yugoslav province. But amid signs of a cabinet split and fears of a backlash on the Conservative backbenches, it rejected a request from General Sir Michael Rose, the UN commander in Bosnia, for immediate reinforcement of Britain's 2,500 troops. Responding to the latest UN plea for an extra 10,650 soldiers to join the 13,000 already in Bosnia, Mr John Major, the prime minister, said British help would be proportionate to and contingent on increased participation in the peace effort. Mr Yasushi Akashi, the UN special envoy for the former Yugoslavia, warned that without the extra troops fragile ceasefires could collapse. Gen Rose said his troops were operating 'on a wing and a prayer'. The US is also coming under pressure to send ground troops to Bosnia. General Jean Cot, head of the UN's peacekeeping forces in the former Yugoslavia, said it was a 'strange and not very courageous idea' that the US would consider sending troops only after a peace settlement was secured. After discussion at the weekly cabinet meeting, Mr Major told British MPs: 'If a request is made to the UK, we would of course consider providing more forces proportionately as part of a wider international effort.' His comment reflected a view among some leading ministers that if the situation in Bosnia continues to improve Britain would find it hard to resist pressure for additional forces. Ministers said the new position in Sarajevo has opened up the prospect of a new phase in the civil war in which the UN would be required to police a number of regional settlements. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, is also under pressure from the army chiefs of staff to meet Gen Rose's request for more troops. It is understood that in spite of recent cuts in army numbers, a battalion of about 900 soldiers could be sent to Bosnia at short notice. But the latest request also opened up the prospect of a cabinet struggle with those ministers who remain opposed to further British commitments to Bosnia. Gen Rose has told Mr Rifkind that he needs more British troops with experience of Northern Ireland. But some senior ministers - said to include Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Michael Heseltine, trade secretary  -have opposed greater British involvement on the ground. During yesterday's discussions Mr Rifkind held back from a formal suggestion of British reinforcement. Mr Major fears that a swathe of rightwing Tory MPs might rebel if Britain increases its commitment. Mr Nicholas Budgen, a Tory back bench opponent of further involvement, claimed growing support for his view that the government risked a 'British Vietnam' in Bosnia. The UN plea for more troops came amid talks between Bosnian Croats and Moslems and Croat officials. They are due to meet in Vienna today for talks on a federation for one part of Bosnia that will have an arrangement with Croatia. In an attempt to persuade Bosnia's Serbs to support these negotiations, Mr Haris Silajdzic, the Bosnian prime minister, met Russian foreign ministry officials.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with South African Ambassador to Lesotho Gerhard </F> Visser by Andre Jordan in Maseru on 15 April; from the  "Newsbrief" program -- first paragraph is announcer's  introduction]    [Text] A day after the events in Lesotho which resulted in  the death of the deputy prime minister, many questions remain  unanswered. Andre Jordan spoke to South Africa's [RSA]  ambassador Maseru, Gerhard Visser, and asked him whether it  would be correct to describe yesterday's events as a coup  attempt.    [Begin recording] [Visser] It is difficult for me to say so,  I have also heard that the prime minister said that it could  have been a coup. It phased out last night with the release of  the four ministers, but the fact that the deputy prime minister  was killed, it's difficult to place it in the category of a  coup, because there was no follow-through. But as I've already  mentioned, and also that it is the policy of the South African  Government, as well as the TEC [Transitional Executive Council]  that South Africa will not recognize any other government in  Lesotho, but the BCP [Basotholand Congress Party] which was  democratically elected in April 1993.    [Jordan] Do you think a statement from our Department of  Foreign Affairs yesterday reiterating that position could have  had any effect in dampening what might have been a developing  coup?    [Visser] This is not the first time that we've made this  statement, Foreign Minister Botha visited Lesotho on the 15th of  January this year, where he made it very clear on television, on  radio, and in public that South Africa will not support any  military coup in Lesotho, or for that matter, any group or  persons who try to overthrow the BCP government by violent  means. It will not be recognized by South Africa, and will  receive no support whatsoever from the outside world.    [Jordan] Is there any indication of just what faction or who  in the army might have been behind yesterday's events?    [Visser] No, all I can tell you is that it is the RLDF, the  Royal Lesotho Defense Force, the soldiers were from the  Makoanyane Barracks, as far as I could gather, and that the four  ministers who were detained were also detained at the Makoanyane  Barracks.    [Jordan] The soldiers at the other barracks on the opposite  side of town, are they likely to take any action. Are they  loyal to the government. Do we see an army split into two  factions, pro and anti-government?    [Visser] That's also a tough question for me to ask as a  diplomat. Yes, I would think the army was split into two  factions in the February and March problems, but it seems to me,  as far as I could gather, and news is difficult to come by in  Maseru, that this time it was the Makoanyane Barracks, and not  the headquarters people that apprehended and detained the  ministers. But I would not say there are two factions in the  RLDF at the moment.    [Jordan] But you say we're not looking at the likelihood of  clashes as happened earlier in the year?    [Visser] It's very difficult to say. I hope not, let me put  it like that, I hope not. I think it's time for the soldiers now  to accept the present government, to discuss their problems with  the present government, and to look at the future of Lesotho per  se. You know these actions by soldiers or individuals or groups  cause tremendous harm to the economy of Lesotho and also to  tourism, etcetera, etcetera. The fact that Foreign Minister  Botha has already told South Africans not to travel to Lesotho  will have an adverse effect on the economy and tourism.    [Jordan] And yet the situation today looks quite normal?    [Visser] It's always been, it's always been very difficult  to  describe to people who have never been to Maseru how it looks  here. I mean even at the heights of the shooting of the 23d of  January this year, well, the soldiers were shooting at each  other on the surrounding hills, the man in the street just went,  more or less, on with his daily life.

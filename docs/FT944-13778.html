			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / There's no such thing as a free risk model Other people's disasters make excellent reading, and the financial press has scented plenty of interesting copy in the derivatives markets. Troubles have afflicted both the financial institutions which originate derivatives - most notably Kidder Peabody - and a range of hapless clients ranging from Procter &amp; Gamble to Glaxo Holdings and from Metallgesellschaft to Gibson Greetings. Writing off the odd Dollars 100m to experience can be painful, but the more important question is whether there is a serious risk to the stability of the financial system as a whole. The subject was explored in depth at a conference on financial fragility which I attended in Maastricht, the Netherlands, last month. The general conclusion of the conference, which was organised by the Limburg Institute of Financial Economics (part of the University of Limburg) in collaboration with Ernst &amp; Young, was inevitably open-ended: no, but . . . A positive view, for instance, was expressed by Jerry Jordan, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland. Risks are fundamental to the financial system, and derivatives are used to redistribute them. If the overall effect is to reallocate risks to those market participants best placed to handle them, the result should be a more robust system. Significantly, newspapers which headline spectacular losers never inquire about the corresponding winners - of which there must be some, given that the derivatives business is a zero sum game. Often, of course, the gains will be thinly spread across many direct and indirect counterparties. But the point is that such profits serve to strengthen the rest of the system. Such arguments are damaged if too many corporate treasurers blunder into half-understood contracts, under heavy selling pressure. There is an expensive learning curve here. We have seen evidence, too, of over-concentration of risk, among hedge funds, so that market risk may be transformed into credit risk. *something in here (HP) * The banks have responded to the growth of derivatives by developing highly complex risk models, designed to minimise the levels of prudential capital, while satisfying the regulators about their security. Curiously, JP Morgan, an industry leader, decided two weeks ago to issue a version of its proprietary risk management model Risk-Metrics free of charge. At the Maastricht conference Andrew Crockett, general manager of the Bank for International Settlements in Basle, was especially cautious about the impact of shocks. He pointed out Frank Knight's 1921 distinction between risk and uncertainty. Risk relates to events which, although not individually forecastable, follow a probability distribution and can therefore be modelled and provided for. However, uncertainty is unpredictable and undiversifiable. Although Crockett did not say so, this might be a reason for worrying about the robustness of the banks' risk models, which depend upon historical correlations and volatilities. That doomster, Henry Kaufman, dwelt on this very theme in a speech in Florida on Monday, warning that such models were untested in any number of difficult scenarios, 'most importantly a period of extreme monetary policy stringency'. Crockett says past examples of financial fragility have often related to mispriced risk, producing bandwagon effects in Third World debt or real estate lending. At least it is possible to learn from such mistakes. It is more tricky to assess the necessary safeguards against truly uncertain events such as political upheavals or natural disasters. This year's global bond market crash has been the worst for many years. The turbulence has not strictly speaking been the result of uncertainty, since the US Federal Reserve's decision to raise short-term interest rates last February was scarcely unpredictable. But the implication is that market participants have been able to take ever-larger bets on future trends. The vulnerability to external shocks may have been increased by the wider use of derivatives. Andrew Crockett did not wish to cry wolf. But he was reluctant to assume that the next crisis would be just one more 1987-style near miss.</p>

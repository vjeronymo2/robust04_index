			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / Jobs: Where bosses are best off - Smaller companies' executive-pay league ALTHOUGH the table to the right is one of the Jobs column's hardy annuals, this year it might seed After 14 years in opposition, its leaders must be looking enviously on the fourth term recently won by Felipe Gonzalez's Spanish socialists. And oddly enough, on the table's evidence, one result of their policies has been to keep Spain's top bosses well off. Before saying more on same, however, I'd better explain the table which, as before, appears here by courtesy of the European Remuneration Network, a consortium of 10 consultancies and institutes carrying out pay surveys. Their latest combined exercise covers more than 38,000 executives employed by 3,486 assorted organisations in the United Kingdom and 11 continental countries. Anyone wanting the full report - which contains far more data than I have room for, and is priced at Pounds 525 - should contact Michael Smith of the network's UK representative, P-E International at Park House, Wick Rd, Egham, Surrey TW20 OHW; tel (0)784 434411, fax (0)784 471404. My extracts are confined to seven of the countries, and to companies in only two particular size-bands as measured by total numbers of employees. The first are those with up to 250 people on the payroll, the second group having between 250 and 1,000. The reason why Germany is not among the countries, by the way, is that the report did not enable me to break down the data into those two size brackets. While the separate surveys included in the exercise were made at different times of the year, the findings have all been updated in line with higher-pay movements to the end of last month. The continental currencies have been converted into sterling at the London closing exchange rates of June 10. For each country and size-band, the table begins with managing directors. Then come four of their immediate subordinates whose order in the ranking varies from place to place: the heads of sales and marketing, production, finance, and personnel. But in the UK there were too few personnel heads in the smallest outfits to furnish worthwhile data; and not enough in the Netherlands to provide a full range. In every case the table shows both basic salary and total pay received in money, including bonuses and the like. The lower quartile figures in light type relate to the executive who would be a quarter way up from the bottom of a ranking of all in the same country and type of job. The upper quartiles, again in light type, refer to the one ranked a quarter way down from the top. The median figures in bold type refer to the executive midway in the ranking, and give not only the salary and total cash pay, but also a rough indication of buying power. It is calculated by taking the total pay, deducting the country's standard tax and so on for someone married with two dependent children, then adjusting the result in line with P-E's index of differences in living costs at the exchange rates of June 10. Alas, such indices cannot be more than a loose guide because technical difficulties prevent them from taking account of housing costs. But they are the best available gauge of purchasing power - which is, after all, what counts. As may be seen, despite Spain's devaluation five weeks ago, its median managing directors in both size-bands top the buying-power list, although their subordinate departmental heads generally do worse than their counterparts in Switzerland and France. How's that for socialism?</p>

			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Bradford &amp; Bingley leaps ahead 51% to Pounds 58.8m BRADFORD &amp; Bingley, the seventh largest building society, yesterday disclosed a 51 per cent rise in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 58.8m, compared with Pounds 38.9m. The figures confirmed the society's recovery from a difficult 1992. Interim results have shown societies achieving higher profits by increasing the spread between interest charged on mortgages and paid on retail savings products despite increases in provisions for bad and doubtful debts. B&amp;B's figures provided further evidence that societies are facing strong competition from banks and other centralised mortgage lenders, and have found it difficult to attract retail savings amid falling interest rates. B&amp;B raised provisions for bad and doubtful debts to Pounds 28.3m (Pounds 25.7m). However, it said that both cases of mortgage arrears and re-possession of houses from borrowers were down, and full year provisions would be 'well below' 1992. Operating profits before bad debt provisions rose by 35 per cent to Pounds 87.1m (Pounds 64.6m). There was a 4.8 per cent rise in mortgage assets to Pounds 10.6bn (Pounds 10.2bn) and total assets rose by 1.6 per cent to Pounds 13.3bn (Pounds 13.1bn). Mr Geoffrey Lister, chief executive, said it was 'reassuring' to see profits being maintained at similar levels to the second half of 1992. The profit improvement had been achieved despite difficult trading conditions. The society's tier 1 ratio of core capital to assets rose slightly to 10.5 per cent. Its gross capital rose to 6.6 per cent of assets (5.8 per cent). Newcastle Building Society announced a rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 5.98m to Pounds 6.4m in the half year to June 30. Leeds &amp; Holbeck Building Society showed an increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 2.88m (Pounds 2.79m). The society, which is the 17th largest with assets of Pounds 2.45bn (Pounds 2.29bn), raised provisions to Pounds 9.9m (Pounds 7.4m).</p>

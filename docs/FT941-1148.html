			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Capital Industries disappoints Shares in Capital Industries fell 15p to 154p yesterday after the specialist packaging and financial services group announced a smaller than expected increase in profits from Pounds 2.45m to Pounds 4.5m pre-tax in 1993. Mr Peter Underhill, chief executive, blamed the share price fall on the group's failure to meet profit forecasts of Pounds 5.4m. 'We made a profit but nothing like what we expected,' he said yesterday. Profits were held back by manufacturing problems at Samuel Jones, the group's laminated packaging business where anticipated production improvements did not materialise despite a Pounds 500,000 investment in new machinery. Mr Underhill admitted second-half profits had been hit but said the subsidiary, acquired in late 1992, had increased group turnover to Pounds 74.8m (Pounds 24.3m). Output had improved in recent months, he added. A full year's contribution from Samuel Jones also lifted the industrial division's operating profits to Pounds 3.84m (Pounds 2.2m) Group operating profits of Pounds 5.3m (Pounds 3m) were further boosted by Pounds 1.44m (Pounds 1m) from the financial services division - dominated by its Capital Ventures subsidiary. Profits generated by the company - which manages Pounds 320m for enterprise zones - is expected to offset funds lost by the end of the Business Expansion Scheme, a main source of profits in the past. Earnings rose to 12.9p (9.8p) and the final dividend is held at 2.4p for a total of 4.4p (4p).</p>

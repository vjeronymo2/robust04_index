			<p><P> February 5, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> DUVALL SAYS ACTING IS BEING REAL  </P> <P> Actor Robert Duvall has prepared himself for roles by hanging out with bums on  the Bowery, riding horses with the Texas Rangers and tramping through a  Louisiana swamp with an alligator hunter.  </P> <P> He's not sure if it was all worth it.  </P> <P> "You could do all the research in the world -- sometimes it pays off, sometimes  it doesn't," Duvall says in the March issue of Smart magazine. "Sometimes you  don't have time. You got to be a human being up there. That's the most  important thing."  </P> <P> Duvall, who won an Oscar for "Tender Mercies" and starred in "The Godfather"  and "The Great Santini," says he's a stickler for detail in his characters and  in films in general.  </P> <P> "When actors start acting bigger than life, bigger than the people they play,  then they're in trouble," Duvall said. "For example, I can't even talk about  'Gone With the Wind.' You don't see people in the South like that. It's a  joke."  </P></p>

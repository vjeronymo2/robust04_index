			<p><P> November 7, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAILORS HANG UP MITTS AFTER NAVY CRIES FOUL  </P> <P> A ban on sailors using a San Diego park threatens to disrupt an organized adult  softball league that raises money for underprivileged and disabled youths.  </P> <P> Blaming gang- and drug-related violence, Navy officials declared Southeast  Athletic Field off-limits last week. But the area, as well as being an urban  battleground, also serves 500 ballplayers of Sports America, a nonprofit group  raising money to build a sports complex.  </P> <P> Sailors have hung up their mitts because of the off-limits ban, and three games  have been canceled so far, said Gary (Ike) Isakson, president of Sports  America.  </P> <P> "Unless there's some resolution, and quickly, this will force Sports America to  close," said Isakson, a former center fielder with a Chicago White Sox  minor-league team. The group has been unable to obtain permits to play in other  parks, frequently crowded with Little League and other youth groups, he said.  </P> <P> In its first year, Sports America raised $17,500. Of that money, $12,000 has  paid for equipment and renting ball fields through next year, and $1,250 was  donated to Southeast Recreation Council of San Diego to help organize sports  for poor children, Isakson said.  </P> <P> But Navy officials say the trouble-ridden park warrants a ban. After six months  of investigation, officials concluded that the park, at 45th Street and Logan  Avenue, and another one at South Mission Beach, known as the South Jetty, are  too dangerous to permit sailors to use. On July 29, six sailors from a frigate  were shot at by a gang in the Southeast Athletic Field. The sailors dived into  a car and drove a block away, where the driver got out to inspect his car for  damage -- not realizing that the gang was in hot pursuit. The sailor was shot  in the shoulder.  </P> <P> The commanding officer of the frigate complained that his crew had survived  deployment in the Philippines and the Western Pacific, only to be attacked in  San Diego.  </P> <P> "Normally we put bans on places for selling drug paraphernalia -- this place  sells rock cocaine every few feet," said Lt. Steve Rogers, a Navy attorney.  </P> <P> "This is not your basic place to throw Frisbees and walk your dog," said Cmdr.  Doug Schamp, a Navy spokesman. "I'd rather explain to a guy why he can't play  ball there than explain to the guy's mother why her son got shot."  </P> <P> The Navy has asked Isakson to send them a letter about the softball league,  Schamp said. Officials could exempt sailors from the ban for the specific  purpose of playing in the league, he said.  </P> <P> Sailors say that, until the final call, they won't play ball.  </P> <P> Chris Neiffer, a petty officer 1st class, said he doesn't believe the park is  dangerous. In fact, when he plays, he usually takes his wife and children, ages  19 months to 9 years.  </P> <P> "The ban shocked me. It's sad -- I have no place to play now, and that was  basically the only way I stay in shape," said Neiffer, who has lived in San  Diego seven years. "We've got to honor the ban. I'm not going to jeopardize my  career just to play softball."  </P></p>

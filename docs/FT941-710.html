			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / People: Departures Australian Peter Thomas, 61, an executive director of Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company, has finally decided to retire back to Australia and says that he will not be making any comebacks. Thomas, P&amp;O's head of corporate affairs, is one of the few senior P&amp;O executives who joined Britain's biggest shipping company long before it was transformed by Lord Sterling's arrival in 1982. A former editor of the Birmingham Sketch, Thomas first joined P&amp;O in 1960, went back to Australia in 1967 with Overseas Containers Australia, before returning to P&amp;O. He then spent several years with Smiths Industries before returning to P&amp;O for a third time in 1980. After seven years on the P&amp;O board, he retires in April but will retain his links with the group by joining P&amp;O Australia in Sydney.</p>

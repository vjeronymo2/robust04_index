			<p><P> December 30, 1990, Sunday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> 3 CHURCHES TO JOIN IN WORLD PEACE PRAYER  </P> <P> Three Ventura County churches plan a local gathering in connection with a  worldwide prayer for peace early Monday at Camarillo Community Center.  </P> <P> The World Peace Prayer was started five years ago by John Randolph Price of the  Quartus Foundation, a nondenominational research group in Austin, Texas.  </P> <P> The Camarillo Church of Religious Science, the Center Church of Religious  Science, and the Ventura County Church of Religious Science have joined the  event since its beginning in 1986. The Rev. William Curtiss of the Camarillo  Church said about 2 billion people worldwide are expected to participate in  this year's prayer at noon, Greenwich Mean Time, which is 4 a.m. in California.  </P> <P> Curtiss said that because of the Persian Gulf situation, he expects a bigger  crowd this year than the 200 to 300 people who showed up in 1989.  </P> <P> Curtiss said the prayer supplies an spiritual element that had been missing in  world politics before its inception.  </P> <P> "It's what brought the Berlin Wall down," Curtiss said. "I think that's a  direct result of that."  </P> <P> Curtiss said people will gather at 3:30 a.m. for the event, which also will  feature a music program and refreshments. Curtiss said the prayer is  nondenominational and the public is invited. JAMES E. FOWLER  </P></p>

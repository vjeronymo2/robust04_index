			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under Customs proposed position, the only type of glass article classifiable as part of the class or kind ``preserving jars of glass'', would be regular and wide-mouth ``Mason-type'', threaded, home-canning jars with self-sealing lids. Glass articles with wire bails and glass or porcelain caps or lids would not be classifiable as ``preserving jars of glass'' as their physical characteristics do not allow them to be recommended for home canning use.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Glassware of a Kind Used for Table or Kitchen Purposes Glass Storage Articles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based on the plain language of the heading, Customs is of the opinion that subheading 7013.39, HTSUS, provides for the class ``glassware of a kind used for table or kitchen purposes''.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Customs position is based on exemplars from EN 70.13, which we believe demonstrate that the class ``glassware of a kind used for table or kitchen purposes'' provides for certain glass articles principally used for household storage. EN 70.13, pg. 936&hyph;937, states, in pertinent part, that: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> [T]his heading covers the following types of articles, most of which are obtained by pressing or blowing in moulds:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) [T]able or kitchen glassware, e.g., drinking glasses, goblets, tankards, decanters, infants' feeding bottles, pitchers, jugs, plates, salad bowls, sugar-bowls, sauce-boats, fruit-stands, cake-stands, hors-d'oeuvres dishes, bowls, basins, egg-cups, butter dishes, oil or vinegar cruets, dishes (for serving, cooking, etc.) stew-pans, casseroles, trays, salt cellars, sugar sifters, knife-rests, mixers, table hand bells, coffee-pots and coffee-filters, sweetmeat boxes, graduated kitchenware, plate warmers, table mats, certain parts of domestic churns, cups for coffee-mills, cheese dishes, lemon squeezers, ice-buckets *&blank;*&blank;* <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Customs understands that the exemplars listed are articles principally used to hold or store other articles in the home. We believe that among these articles, certain glass storage jars may also be principally used in this fashion. Therefore, glass articles which are principally used to store articles in the home are classifiable under subheading 7013.39, HTSUS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After reviewing the ENs, relevant HRL's, and applying the principal use factors, which are indicative but not conclusive, for determining whether merchandise falls within a particular class or kind, Customs has identified the following characteristics which we believe are indicative, but not conclusive of glassware of a kind used for table or kitchen purposes; glass household storage articles. They are glass articles: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Made of ordinary glass, lead crystal glass, glass having a low coefficient of expansion (e.g., borosilicate glass) or of glass ceramics (the latter two in particular, for kitchen glassware). They may also be colourless, coloured or of flashed glass, and may be cut, frosted, etched or engraved;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Having a decorative motif consistent with a kitchen decor (e.g., geese, ``country theme'', etc.);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Which the consumer purchases primarily to use for storage in the home;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Sold from the importer to a wholesaler/distributor who then sells them to a retailer;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Sold in an environment of sale that emphasizes the article's use or reuse as a storage article;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Sold to the ultimate purchaser empty;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Which are recognized in the trade as primarily having a household storage use; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. Which are imported with their caps or lids. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

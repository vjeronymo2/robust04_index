Yakutsk Mayor Aleksey Tomtosov told  ITAR-TASS by telephone on Monday morning that the terrorist was  a certain Abdulayev, who had been earlier convicted three times.    On February 4 he demanded that the republic's government  deliver 500,000 U.S. dollars and 500 million roubles or else he  would set off several explosions and commit several other acts  of terror in Yakutsk.    It was soon found out that Abdulayev had planted no bombs.  It was also established that no group Vozmezdie (Retribution)  existed: It was an invention of the hardened criminal who  wanted money to pay off major debts and "enjoy some good  living", as he put it himself. Aleksey Tomtosov said criminal  proceedings had been instituted. Specialists of the Federal  Ministry of Internal Affairs and Counter-Intelligence Service  supposed from the very beginning that the criminal was bluffing,  but a large-scale operation was launched to make sure that no  danger threatens the city and its residents.</p>

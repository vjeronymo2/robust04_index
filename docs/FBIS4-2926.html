			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentator's article: "It Is Also Necessary To Sound a </F> Constant Warning Alarm in the Press Circles"]    [Text] A prominent characteristic of the illegal  fundraising activities of Shen Taifu, president of the former  Changcheng Mechanical and Electrical Science and Technology  Corporation, was that a small number of journalists were bought  over by Shen with bribes to whitewash the illicit business, to  give counsel and publicity to such deals, and to add fuel to the  flames. Otherwise, how could so many people be taken in and  such a huge amount of money accumulated by illicit means within  such a short period of time? Today, this newspaper publishes a  report about Sun Shuxing, who was found guilty of giving and  receiving bribes, and Cai Yuanjiang, who was found guilty of  taking bribes, revealing another aspect of Changcheng's illegal  fundraising activities. A lesson should be drawn from such  cases and journalists in particular, should give deep thought to  such cases and thus raise their vigilance.    In the course of developing the socialist market economy, it  is natural that economic entities of all types are certain to  pay attention to using the news media and enlisting their help.  Journalists should also actively orient their work toward the  economy, the market, and toward the enterprises, and should  serve the purpose of more quickly establishing the socialist  market economy. However, they must observe the ethical norms of  journalism, strictly separate news reporting from advertising,  and never engage in "paid news reporting." They must not do  such things as lavishing praise on somebody who pays them money  or exaggerating the achievements of such bribe-givers, thus  misleading the public. Otherwise, they may: Go against the  principle that news reporting must be objective, authentic, and  fair; sully the reputation of the journalistic undertakings led  by the party; and they may also disrupt the economic order and  social stability. It is a regrettable fact that in recent  years, a small number of journalists have failed to withstand  the corrosive influence of money fetishism, gave up their  principles while being lured by pecuniary benefit, and even  became accomplices of some economic criminals and became bogged  down in the mire of evil.    Last year, the CPC Central Propaganda Department and the  State Press and Publications Administration jointly issued the  "Circular on Strengthening the Trade Ethics of the Journalists  and Banning `Paid News Reporting.'" After that, anticorruption  was taken seriously in journalistic circles. Various  journalistic institutions banned "paid news reporting" and took  this as an important point in their efforts to consolidate trade  ethics among their personnel. They formulated a series of  concrete measures according to their specific conditions and  intensified education, management, and inspection. The vast  numbers of journalists also strictly practiced self-discipline.  Through such efforts over the past year, marked results have  been achieved. However, anticorruption is a long-term task and  opposing "paid news reporting" is also a long-term task. We  should not overestimate the results achieved in the previous  stage and should not underestimate the arduousness of the  struggle in the future. We must never relax our efforts by even  the slightest bit. Vigilance must always be maintained, the  fundamental purpose of serving the people and the socialist  cause must always be borne in mind, and the fine style of  working hard and remaining uncontaminated amidst temptations  must always be kept up.    In Shen Taifu's illegal fundraising activities, a very small  number of reporters did things which were incompatible with  their trade ethics and in violation of the law. This is a  painful lesson to learn. The editorial committee of this  newspaper has laid down anticorruption regulations and has set  strict demands on our colleagues. We have also established a  complaint hotline and we welcome strict supervision from people  in all walks of life. We are willing to join comrades in other  journalistic institutions in improving the ideological  consciousness, moral integrity, and work style of the  journalists and are making efforts for this purpose.    Comrade reporters, let us learn a profound lesson from the  negative experience of Sun Shuxing and Cai Yuanjiang. Always  bear in mind the great trust placed in us by the party and the  people, always bear in mind our glorious and sacred mission, and  always apply the pens, microphones, and cameras in our hands  properly!</p>

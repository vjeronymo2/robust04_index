			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Survey of Morocco (10): Hub of undeclared activity - The importance of the informal sector ALTHOUGH it has been suggested that production of goods and services in Morocco's traditionally flourishing informal sector may amount to 70 per cent of official gross domestic product, academics and businessmen believe that 30 per cent is a more realistic figure. No one, however, is in any doubt that this sector plays a key role, providing hundreds of thousands of jobs. The fact that it thrives helps to explain why, despite two years of drought and declining GDP, the kingdom has so far not witnessed any serious social disturbances. Morocco's national accounts revalue the statistics they receive by a coefficient to take account of the informal sector: the value of manufacturing is thus raised by 14 per cent and that of the building sector by 15-20 per cent. This figure is reached by matching the number of permits to build with the consumption of cement. In some sectors, the percentage of activity accounted for by the informal sector is more precisely measured - it accounts for 36 per cent of all clothes manufacturing, 30 per cent of all food processing and tobacco, 16 per cent of manufacturing of upholstery, 28 per cent of transport of goods, 25 per cent of hotel business and 19 per cent of all activities grouped until the broad name of 'repairs'. These estimates date from 1988 but the Direction de la Statistique in Rabat feels they hold true today. Under the name 'informal sector' may be found a multitude of sins. First and foremost is the USDollars 2bn estimate of hashish exported every year to western Europe from the north-west Rif mountains around Tangiers and Tetuan. Not all that money is reinvested in the local economy, but the price of real estate and the impossibility of finding builders in Tangiers, Nador and the Spanish enclave of Ceuta are enough to convince any observer that a lot of money is washing around. Money from this source must be added to that made from illegal imports through Ceuta and the other Spanish Mediterranean enclave of Melilla, which it partly finances. Alcohol around these ports fetches one-third of the price it does in Casablanca. Moroccan buyers have access to all the latest hi-fi, computers and white goods they can afford on the free market in Casablanca - these goods are much cheaper in the north. In recent years a thriving market in cars stolen in Europe has developed, often brought in by Moroccan emigres in France or Belgium who have been made redundant. The Fnideq market near Ceuta handles an estimated 40,000 such vehicles a year. Another source of informal money is the selling of fish caught by Moroccan vessels to foreign fishermen on the high seas, in exchange for foreign currency. Precise figures are impossible to obtain, but observers believe that a few hundred million dollars would not overstate the volume of that particular trade. Customs officials are unable to prevent the smuggling nor do their modest salaries - Dh1,600 a month with only a further Dh0.35 per extra hour of work  -suggest they have the incentive to try. The figure of tonnage unloaded in several Moroccan ports is thus believed to underestimate the true weight and value of cargo. An estimated 450,000 informal jobs exist in manufacturing, worth at least Dh30bn. Moroccan industrialists readily admit that a third of what they manufacture is not declared, pointing to the fact that tax inspectors are so harsh in their treatment that they encourage people to cheat. As in Tunisia, tax inspectors seem to consider private entrepreneurs a bunch of thieves. Another reason why industrialists and those in the service sector conceal their activities is the stringent nature of the labour laws, which make it difficult and expensive to fire employees. The reaction of local manufacturers to illegal imports varies. General Tire, for instance, is not best pleased to see Goodyear tyres smuggled in from the Canary Islands. Others are less worried because their own brand products manufactured in Spain are brought in. One important factor in all this is that Moroccans often prefer imported products to locally manufactured ones, even if they have to pay more because they reckon they are getting better value for money. They are not always wrong. As for paying added value tax, wholesalers may have to, but the many small shops do not. In a country where two-thirds of the population is unable to read or write, imposing VAT across the board would not be practicable. It is important to bear in mind that local family networks dominate much of Morocco's activity, even in large towns such as Casablanca. Many laws enacted by the French or the new state were quite inapplicable from the start. Today few Moroccan industrialists who are in dispute will go to court because the legal system is erratic, slow and often corrupt. Rather, they will resort to one of their peers who is respected both for his sense of fair play and knowledge of the matter which is in dispute. The consequence of the past two years of drought are interesting in this respect. As farmers were forced to sell their cattle to make ends meet, the price of red meat was pushed down. But official slaughterhouses did not change their prices, thus forcing farmers into illegal slaughtering and selling. Butchers thus bought directly, bypassing the slaughterhouses. Such transactions are often agreed to by the powerful Mouktassib, the corporation which traditionally checks the honesty of transactions, the quality of goods, notably food, and their conformity with religious edicts. Appointed directly by provincial governors, the Mouktassib, whose powers were reinforced by royal decree 10 years ago, appear to many Moroccans to be more attuned to the real needs of Moroccan society than many of the bureaucrats. The informal sector is in many respects a safety valve for Moroccan society. It supplies flexible jobs at a fraction of the cost of the formal sector. Yet, one of the tests of the progress Morocco makes as it modernises its economy will be the authorities' capacity to ensure a more open and accountable system. That does not simply mean bringing the private sector to heel; it also means that the authorities will behave in a fairer and more open manner with all Moroccan citizens and companies.</p>

			<p><P> July 19, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRADE DATA DEPRESSES STOCKS; DOW DIPS 8.73  </P> <P> A worse-than-expected trade deficit undermined the stock market Tuesday,  driving the Dow Jones industrial index to a second decline after a nine-day  rally.  </P> <P> The Dow index fell 8.73 points to 2,544.76.  </P> <P> Before the market opened, the Commerce Department announced that the nation's  merchandise trade deficit rose to $10.24 billion in May, well above  expectations of a $9-billion gap.  </P> <P> Some analysts said the stock market, which opened lower and never recovered,  showed underlying strength by holding up as well as it did.  </P> <P> "It gives ground grudgingly. There's still lots of cash on the sidelines," said  Alan Ackerman, a Gruntal &amp; Co. analyst in New York.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Decliners Outpace Advancers  </P> <P> Still, two down sessions in a row have put a chill on the July rally, which saw  the Dow rise 114.76 from the end of June through last Friday's close.  </P> <P> Tuesday's market decline, although modest, was more pronounced than Monday's,  when the Dow slipped just 1.33 and advancing stocks narrowly outnumbered  declining ones.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, decliners outnumbered advancers by about 11 to 8 in nationwide  trading of New York Stock Exchange.  </P> <P> Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 152.35 million shares, up from  131.96 million in the previous session.  </P> <P> Marion Laboratories led the list of most actively traded NYSE issues, rising 1  to 34 1/2, after the announcement Tuesday that Dow Chemical had signed a  definitive agreement to acquire 67% of its stock over the next two or three  years.  </P> <P> More than 13 million Marion shares changed hands in composite dealings, adding  significantly to overall trading volume. Dow Chemical, meanwhile, fell 1 5/8 at  86 3/4.  </P> <P> International Business Machines, a blue chip bellwether, fell 1 1/4 to 114 3/4  despite an earnings report that met expectations. The 39% quarterly gain was  largely the result of special factors. The stock had risen by an identical  amount Monday.  </P> <P> Apple Computer fell 1 1/2 to 39 1/4 in heavy over-the-counter trading after  reporting a 5.3% earnings gain, below market expectations.  </P> <P> Warner Communications rose 1/4 to 65 5/8, Paramount Communications rose 3/4 to  57 and Time fell 3 to 138. The companies are embroiled in a three-way takeover  battle.  </P> <P> In Tokyo, stocks eased as anxiety ahead of Japan's upper house elections on  Sunday continued to paralyze the stock market. The Nikkei 225-share index  retreated 112.49 points to close at 33,343.73.  </P> <P> Share prices ended slightly lower on the London Stock Exchange, as the market  absorbed news of the widened U.S. trade deficit. Trading closed at an hour  earlier than usual, owing to a 24-hour strike by British public transport  workers. The 100-share Financial Times index ended down 1.8 points at 2,273.1.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Credit  </P> <P> Bond prices slumped after the government released its report on U.S. trade  deficit figures, but analysts said some of the decline was a technical  correction following the credit market's recent gains.  </P> <P> The Treasury's key 30-year bond, which lost 1/2 point or $5 per $1,000 face  amount Monday, fell another 13/16, or about $8.13 per $1,000 face amount Its  yield, which moves inversely to price, jumped to 8.19% from 8.12% late Monday.  </P> <P> The credit markets were particularly shaken by a surge in imports, which  investors believed could portend increased consumer demand and a reinvigorated  economy, said Ward McCarthy, a managing director of Stone &amp; McCarthy  Research Associates Inc.  </P> <P> Traders fear that if the economy surges, the Federal Reserve Board is likely to  tighten credit, driving interest rates higher and bond prices lower.  </P> <P> McCarthy, calling Tuesday's losses a correction, said they were partly because  the market has "gone too far too long without some kind of a setback."  </P> <P> In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term governments  fell about 3/16 point, intermediate maturities fell 5/16 point to 3/8 point and  long-term issues fell 11/16 point, Telerate Inc., a financial information  service, reported.  </P> <P> The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the price of a bond  with a $1,000 face value.  </P> <P> The Shearson Lehman Hutton daily Treasury bond index, which measures price  movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or  longer, fell 3.94 to 1,182.38.  </P> <P> Industrial and utility corporate bonds also weakened. Moody's investment grade  corporate bond index, which measures return on a portfolio of 80 corporate  bonds with maturities of five years or longer, fell 1.01 to 328.98.  </P> <P> The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, traded  at 9.188%, down from 9.25% late Monday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Currency  </P> <P> The dollar lost value against most major currencies in U.S. dealings that were  hectic at times as traders reacted to the unexpectedly poor trade report.  </P> <P> Earlier, on foreign exchange markets abroad, the dollar finished mixed.  </P> <P> Gold prices moved modestly higher at home after a mixed showing overseas.  </P> <P> On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current delivery rose  $1.60 to $372.60 an ounce. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a bid of  $371.90 for an ounce of bullion at 4 p.m. EDT, up $1.60 from Monday's late bid.  </P> <P> Simon Fischer, a vice president at Bear, Stearns &amp; Co., said currency  trading was brisk immediately after the Commerce Department issued its trade  report.  </P> <P> News in the report that imports grew 4.3% to a record $40.71 billion in May  implied that the U.S. economy remains strong because it is drawing in vast  quantities of foreign goods.  </P> <P> This point fed bullish sentiment toward the dollar because it suggested that  the Federal Reserve Board might be less inclined to drive down interest rates.  </P></p>

			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Emap in 'aggressive mode' for acquisitions Emap, the media and exhibitions groups, is planning to continue its twin policies of launching new magazine titles and expanding through acquisition. Mr Robin Miller, chief executive, warned yesterday: 'We are in an aggressive mode. We think this is a good time to acquire both at home and abroad.' He added that by next June he expected Emap to be a somewhat larger company than it is today. Mr Miller was speaking as the group announced a pre-tax profit rise of 8 per cent to Pounds 45.7m for the year to April 2 - a result that appeared to compare badly with last year's 56 per cent increase to Pounds 42.4m. This year's profit figure came after Pounds 9.7m in launch investment - the company launched 22 magazines during the year - and Pounds 2.5m in rationalisation costs. The underlying pre-tax figure represented an increase of 20 per cent. Ms Lorna Tilbian, media analyst at SG Warburg, stockbrokers, gave Emap 'full marks' with printing operations the only disappointment. She is sticking with a Pounds 58m forecast for the present year. Mr Derek Terrington, publishing analyst at Kleinwort Benson raised his forecast from Pounds 56m to Pounds 59m. The share price closed 18p higher at 397p yesterday. Less is expected to be spent on launches this year between Pounds 6m and Pounds 7m. Turnover rose 14 per cent to Pounds 362m (Pounds 318.3m). Earnings per share were 16.8p (17p) and the total dividend is being raised to 8.86p (7.9p) with a recommended final payment of 6.4p. Sir John Hoskyns, the new chairman, said Emap saw a gradual, but long-term improvement in advertising, which accounted for 50 per cent of the company's business. 'This coupled with rationalisation and launch activity in the last year will have a very positive impact,' he said. Consumer magazines maintained operating profits of Pounds 24m, but underlying growth was 19 per cent. Operating profits of business communications, the combined magazine and exhibitions interests, rose by 33 per cent to Pounds 14.6m. Newspapers were up 8 per cent to Pounds 8.1m and the radio division grew 25 per cent to Pounds 1m. These figures exclude rationalisation costs. COMMENT A superficial glance at the pre-tax profit level would suggest that Emap was starting to go off the boil. The group said yesterday that they were simply getting on with successfully launching new magazines. And although newspaper margins are at the low end by the group's standards, executives can point to the fact that their Northampton Chronicle won an award as the fastest growing daily last year. If Emap can contain launch costs, boost advertising revenues as the economy improves and consumate takeovers, it should return to brisk growth with pre-tax profits this year of about Pounds 58m for an undemanding prospective p/e of 18.</p>

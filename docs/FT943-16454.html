			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / Treuhand sues bank: Agency seeks to recover communist cash The Treuhand privatisation agency for eastern Germany has launched a civil court action in Zurich against the Swiss subsidiary of Bank Austria to recover Sch1.76bn (Pounds 101m) plus interest. It claims the money was deposited there by agents of the former East German Communist party in the spring of 1991 as the German Democratic Republic (GDR) collapsed. The 359-page suit also accuses Bank Austria of co-operating fully with the east Germans, particularly in destroying the trail the funds followed. A Bank Austria spokesman said that a series of transactions managed by a prominent Austrian communist party official was examined by the Austrian authorities nearly two years ago when the Treuhand first made its accusations and found nothing illegal. The bank contends that it had - and still has - no knowledge that the funds came from two Berlin companies, Novum Handelsgesellschaft and Transcarbon Handelsgesellschaft. The Treuhand claims both were known for their close dealings with the GDR government. For their part, lawyers for Novum and Transcarbon say their companies belonged to the Austrian Communist party, and that the money does not belong to Germany. What is known is that in May 1991 Ms Rudolfine Steindling, an Austrian Communist party leader, opened two accounts with Bank Austria (Schweiz), then called BFZ Bankfinanz. Ms Steindling was a key go-between in deals between Austria and the former East bloc countries. She is believed to exercise control over most of the businesses owned by the Austrian party. In the months after May 1991 some Sch1.76bn was transferred into the accounts, a sum that was larger than the bank's balance sheet. The money was then drawn out gradually between June 1991 and February 1992 in amounts varying from Sch20m to Sch60m in cash. The Treuhand suspects that most of it was used to buy Austrian savings bonds and then deposited in several anonymous numbered accounts in Austrian banks. All documentary evidence of these fund movements appears to have disappeared. Mr Dieter Jann-Corrodi, the Zurich prosecutor, said that when he made initial investigations in 1992, he was told by BFZ that the funds were dispersed among various accounts 'for tax reasons'. The Treuhand's use of civil proceedings is unusual. Money laundering is a criminal offence in Switzerland and many other countries. Mr Jann-Corrodi said that if the case were to succeed, the bank itself would be responsible, not just one or more of its officers.</p>

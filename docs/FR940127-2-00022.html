All participant cost sharing must come from non-Federal funding sources. Currently, it is anticipated that total DOE funding in the amount of $10 million will be available for all awards under the solicitation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The solicitation will be issued on or about March 1, 1994, and will contain detailed information on funding, cost sharing requirements, eligibility, application preparation, and evaluation. Responses to the solicitation will be due 45 days after solicitation release. However, applications are encouraged to be submitted prior to the closing date. All responsible sources are encouraged to submit an application and all applications will be considered. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Project Summary <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> While not a requirement, DOE strongly encourages all parties interested in applying for financial assistance under the Commercialization Ventures Program to respond to this notice by providing DOE with a short summary of the prospective project. The primary use of these summaries by DOE will be to ensure that the overall Program adequately addresses industry needs. In addition, DOE will review individual summaries in order to advise potential applicants on whether their proposed project appears to fit within the overall objectives of the Commercialization Venture Program. DOE will not evaluate individual project summaries on whether they meet any criteria for eventual award. All potential applicants who submit a project summary will be advised in writing of whether the summary would seem to fit within the Program or whether the summary seems to present a project that is unsuitable for the Program. If the latter, the potential applicant will be advised of the reasons the potential project may be unsuitable. Project summaries submitted in response to this notice should be received no later than 30 calendar days after the appearance of this notification in order to be considered by DOE in formulating the solicitation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Failure to respond or furnish the information requested will not disqualify anyone from competing when the competitive solicitation is issued. However, the distribution list for the solicitation will be generated as a result of responses to this notice; therefore, all interested parties should respond in some manner, if only by furnishing their name, address and telephone number. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Project summaries are not expected to include detailed plans. Information contained in the responses will not be released to the public; however, if proprietary information is included, this should be marked on the applicable pages. Summaries should be limited to eight (8) pages and include the following information: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Name, address, telephone and fax numbers of the primary contact person. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The potential participants, proposed roles, key personnel and qualifications. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. A concise description of the project including discussion of the following: (a.) product concept; (b.) development status; (c.) where the technology has been demonstrated; (d.) how the technology works; (e.) technical viability, reliability, and manufacturability, including the identity of a potential manufacturing partner, if known and; (f.) the estimated cost per kWh or MMBTU the project will produce and the estimated cost once the technology is fully commercialized. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. A discussion of the potential market for the product or project. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. A discussion of the potential benefits of the product or project, such as environmental, energy savings and/or energy supply contributions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. The total estimated cost of the project, the percentage of cost sharing and the potential source(s) of cost sharing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Length of time to fully construct or implement the project. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Questions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Respondents are encouraged to submit any questions about the Program discussed in this announcement as part of their response. Questions should be submitted as an attachment to the summary, if a project summary is furnished, and will not be counted against the eight (8) page limit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Submit four (4) copies of your project summary or other response to John Meeker at the above address within 30 days of the date of this notice. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Issued in Chicago, Illinois, on January 7, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Alan E.

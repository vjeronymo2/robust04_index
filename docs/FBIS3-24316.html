			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Larisa Sayenko: "The World: To Each Republic Its </F> Own Zhirinovsky"; first paragraph is introductory paragraph]    [Text] Alexander Lukashenko is one of the three real  candidates to the presidency in the Republic of Belarus.    His star rose on the political firmament all of a sudden  Having received a right to form a provisional commission in  charge of studying the activities of the commercial structures  attached to the power structures, the 39-year-old state farm  director essentially created a political scandal. It led to the  resignation of Stanislav Shushkevich, Chairman of the Supreme  Soviet. The "trunks" of compromising material he collected on  top officials in the government and local Soviets earned him the  nationwide recognition as a daredevil fighter against the mafia.    Probably both Stanislav Shushkevich and Vyacheslav Kebich  wanted to use deputy Lukashenko, unaware of the rules of the  game at the top. The "narrow-minded" Lukashenko played his part  brilliantly, having eliminated Shushkevich and frightened  Kebich. Having won the hearts of thousands of electors,  Lukashenko made those "higher-ups" discard their previous  skepticism and recognize in him a real and dangerous rival.    "But can you imagine someone changing at once from the  position of state farm director to that of the president?"  complained in the corridor one of the aides to the prime  minister. "After all, I spoke to him, persuaded him, offered him  a fairly prestigious position. But no, he wants to be the  president. It's absurd."    From the standpoint of the nomenklatura's hierarchy this is  truly unrealistic. A small economic manager from the Shklov  District in the Mogilev Region is trying to oppose the prime  minister, seen by the apparat as the only worthy candidate to  the presidency. Nevertheless Lukashenko has experience in  competing with Vyacheslav Kebich, both of them once passed to  the second round of elections to the Supreme Soviet. Despite the  fact that Kebich had for many years headed the State Economic  Planning Committee and had the backing of a powerful  party-bureaucratic machine, the absolutely unknown politician  "from the plough" ceded a mere 1 percent of the votes.    Lukashenko came to the Supreme Soviet as a reformer. He  always had a dislike for the party nomenklatura and had  frictions with the district authorities, earning the reputation  of being "excessively independent." However, he kept the Gorodok  state farm afloat, which evidently has given him confidence that  he will also be able to run the state. In the framework of his  state farm enough room was found for both private peasant farms  and cooperatives. Although from time to time some in parliament  love to recall how the state farm director used to maintain  order -- with his fists.    At that time he was active in building the Communists for  Democracy faction in opposition to the ruling party  nomenklatura. Today Lukashenko dissociates himself from any  party or faction whatsoever. He preaches the renunciation of  "political mongering", calculatingly targeting the apolitical  and most dispossessed sections of the population -- the rural  provinces.    Alexander Lukashenko speaks on behalf of ordinary,  down-trodden and dispossessed people. He is the leader of  repulsion and destruction, capable of electrifying the mob.    There is hardly a question in the Supreme Soviet on which  deputy Lukashenko has not voiced his opinion. As his opponent  aptly remarked in parliament, Lukashenko has proved his mettle  as an expert on all problems without exception, "from abortion  to missiles." Taking a superactive part in debates, Lukashenko  has not been noticed for any "passion" for lawmaking. He has  neither a political nor an economic program, apart from the  nostalgic theory -- "back to the USSR." Lukashenko used to be  the most furious opponent of privatization and private property.  He is convinced that "state ownership has not exhausted itself  today. In the past it created a sufficiently high level for  people's life which we have destroyed by throwing these people  into a pit."    Long before the scandalous struggle against corruption and  on  the eve of the October events in Moscow, at a joint  Russian-Byelorussian meeting of the Officers' Union, one of the  Byelorussian colonels sadly stated: "Of course, we have no  Rutskois and Terekhovs of our own..." "But we have Lukashenko,"  a voice was heard from the hall. "Lukashenko, Lukashenko,"  rolled approvingly over the rows.    He is even more successful at meetings with electors in the  provinces. He doesn't philosophize, but repeats whatever is  being said in overcrowded buses and rural shops where people  stand in queues waiting for cheap bread.    He plays his own game. Having systematized and classified  hundreds of facts, mostly gathered from the materials of the  KGB, the Ministry of Interior, the Procurator's Office and the  Control Board, Alexander Lukashenko earned a personal political  capital already by the fact that he grew indignant together with  the people. He has already promised that in the immediate future  he will present yet another group or corrupted persons to the  people. The government's inaction in this situation has fuelled  Lukashenko's activities. The struggle for moral integrity seems  to be growing over into a mania. With touching sincerity  Alexander Lukashenko announced, speaking live on TV, that there  were but a few honest persons in the deputy corps.    Already lining up behind the lone Lukashenko's powerful  shoulders in parliament are grey cardinals -- young talented  pragmatist who have no chances of battling their way through the  tightly closed ranks of those presently in power. Moreover, they  believe that it is certainly they, not the "uncouth president,"  that will rule.    But Alexander Lukashenko is already declaring: "It is time  at  last to give them (the minority, the opposition -- L.S.) to  understand who is the boss here." Apparat politicians shrug  their shoulders. It's absurd if "this" boss comes to power.    But don't we have the most fertile ground for absurdity? Or  is whatever is permitted for Russia forbidden for Belarus?    MN File: Alexander Lukashenko is 45 years  old. Upon graduation from the Byelorussian Agricultural  Institute he worked as an agronomist at the Shklov District of  the Mogilev Region. His wife is the head of a kindergarten. They  have two sons. The younger goes to school, and the older is in  his first year at the University, studying at the International  Department and hoping to become a diplomat.    The people's hero is an ascete. His favorite meal is  potatoes, milk and hard-boiled eggs. His favourite books are  "Ivan the Terrible" and "Stepan Razin."</p>

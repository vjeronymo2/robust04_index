			<p><P> February 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE ENGLISH-ONLY MOVEMENT LEGITIMIZES ATTACKS ON BROTHERHOOD AND TOLERANCE  </P> <P> Brotherhood and good will can be protected only by being alert to challenges to  them. Some of the challenges -- like ethnic slurs, hate-filled graffiti and  racist violence -- are crude and obvious. Others are subtle but no less  dangerous. In particular, an ugly strain of prejudice against immigrants and  other "foreigners" has emerged in California, slickly packaged and with an  innocent-sounding name: the official-English movement.  </P> <P> This movement, more accurately called the English-only movement, wants to pass  local and federal laws making English our "official" language nationwide, as  Proposition 63 did for California in 1986. The movement's representatives argue  that English is in danger of being displaced by other languages, especially  Spanish. The movement likes to paint itself as a moderate, common-sense effort  striving only to promote national unity by preserving America's  English-language heritage.  </P> <P> The English-under-siege argument is simply wrong. According to the 1980 census,  98% of American residents over 4 years old speak English "well" or "very well."  A 1985 RAND Corp. study found that among first-generation Americans whose  mother tongue is Spanish, 90% are proficient in English and 50% of their  children can't speak Spanish.  </P> <P> The claim that the English-only movement was moderate and promoted national  unity could have appeared plausible until the passage of English-only laws at  the state and local levels. But, in the aftermath of Proposition 63 and similar  measures elsewhere, it is clear that English-only policies only encourage  hostility toward immigrants and increase intolerance toward citizens,  especially Asians and Latinos, whose first language is not English.  </P> <P> A continuing legal battle in Monterey Park is a case in point. In 1987 a slate  of candidates was elected to the Monterey Park City Council pledging to put  teeth into Proposition 63 at the local level. After taking office, some of the  council members expressed concern over the number of non-English (mainly  Chinese-language) books on the Monterey Park public library's shelves, despite  the fact that the books made up less than 10% of the library's stock. In  October that year, the council dissolved the library's independent board of  commissioners and took control of library management. Although the council used  "financial account-ability" as a justification, its subsequent actions made  clear that its real motivation was contempt for the rights of language  minorities.  </P> <P> The council slashed the library's 1988-89 budget for foreign-language materials  from more than $11,000 to about $3,000. Mayor Barry L. Hatch was surprisingly  frank about his view that the public library's services should be extended only  to citizens able to read English. "I don't think we need to cater too much to  foreign languages," Hatch said. "I think if people want a foreign language they  can go purchase books on their own."  </P> <P> This intolerant rights-for-some-but-not-for-others attitude outraged other  members of the Monterey Park community and led to a lawsuit filed by Monterey  Park citizens and civil-liberties groups in Superior Court. The suit seeks to  reinstate the library board as a way to ensure that the public library serves  all of Monterey Park's citizens.  </P> <P> Similar incidents have occurred in other cities, too. In Huntington Park,  municipal-court employees were forbidden to speak to each other in Spanish, but  the U.S. 9th Circuit Court ruled the ban illegal. English-only supporter S. I.  Hayakawa has said that Proposition 63 prohibits government workers even from  discussing their lunch plans in Spanish. At a hospitalin Los Angeles, the head  nurse forbade workers to speak any language but English and urged employees to  report anyone who violated the ban. The manager of an insurance company ordered  employees not to converse in Chinese unless they were dealing with a  Chinese-speaking customer.  </P> <P> English-only laws were adopted last November in Colorado, Arizona and Florida,  and are already being used to harass Latinos. In Miami a supermarket clerk was  suspended after he spoke Spanish to another worker. When a woman called a  department store to place an order and began speaking in Spanish, the clerk  cited the English-only law and hung up. In Grand Junction, Colo., a school-bus  driver told a student that speaking Spanish was no longer allowed on board.  </P> <P> The idea that laws like Proposition 63 are merely symbolic, or just common  sense, or only promote national unity, is a fantasy. The record of English-only  legislation demonstrates that it legitimizes attacks on brotherhood and  tolerance, encouraging an ugly strain of bigotry that has no place in American  society.  </P></p>

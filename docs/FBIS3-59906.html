			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By KAZTAG correspondent Konstantin Borodinov for TASS] </F>   [Text] Almaty, December 2 TASS -- A group of U.S.  congressmen and experts numbering 35 visited Baykonur cosmodrome  on Thursday to study the possibilities of international  cooperation under Alpha project. The project envisages the  creation of a large international orbital complex which will be  launched and serviced from Baykonur cosmodrome.    "The visit by a large delegation like this may signify a  decisive turn in Baykonur's destiny," said Galym Abilsiitov,  Kazakhstan's deputy premier and minister of science and new  technologies. "If the guests get convinced that the cosmodrome  can operate effectively, new partners can be found, and it can  become possible to operate the cosmodrome on a commercial basis."    Plans for an international space corporation on a basis of  Baykonur cosmodrome were set out at a news conference by Yuriy  Koptev, director-general of the Russian Space Agency, and  Tokhtar Aubakirov, director-general of the Kazakhstan Aerospace  Agency. The corporation is planned to be formed with the  participation of Russia, Kazakhstan, Ukraine and, possibly,  other countries.    Baykonur is living though difficult times. Representatives  of Russia and Kazakhstan are to discuss pressing problems and  bring closer the stances of the two countries on the ways of  practical implementation of intergovernment arrangements.    The heads of the space agencies of the two countries  unanimously believe that after the breakup of a great power,  Russia and Kazakhstan do not have enough funds to ensure the  operation of the huge complex. A number of international  projects are considered. The participation of four partners --  the United States, Canada, Japan and the European Space Agency  uniting 12 countries -- is proposed in one of them. There are  also plans to lease the cosmodrome. Baykonur is still unmatched  in the world.</p>

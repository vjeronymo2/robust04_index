			<p>BFN     [Text] The week began with a new initiative by the  political parties to unblock the crisis situation, notably an  ultimatum that is scheduled to expire at the beginning of this  week.    Last week, Front for Haitian Advancement and Progress;  Hubert  de Ronceray's Mobilization For National Development; the  National Conference; and the Congress of Haitian People for  National Rescue submitted a joint resolution demanding a  solution to the political crisis. The leaders of these political  parties suggested the definitive closing of the file on  negotiating the return of President Aristide, the restoration of  state authority, the priority of a national constitutional  solution, the formation of an ad hoc government capable of  managing the embargo and executing a precise political agenda,  and finally, the organization of general elections.    The promoters of this resolution assert they have received a  very large consensus on this proposal, a copy of which was sent  to the Army General Staff, the Chamber of Deputies, as well as  organizations and institutions from civilian society. In this  resolution, an ultimatum was given to parliament. Parliament  should come to a decision on the situation no later than this  week.</p>

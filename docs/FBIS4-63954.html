Having informed deputies about the  results of the negotiations between the Crimean and Ukrainian  legislative delegations in Kiev, Supreme Soviet Chairman Serhiy  Tsekov suggested electing a working group to continue  negotiations and to search for coordinated (?decisions). Five  lawmakers were elected and will reinforce the group according to  their own discretion.    The session then resumed a discussion of issues included on  the agenda adopted earlier.

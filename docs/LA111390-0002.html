			<p><P> November 13, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAPLE LEAFS END LOSING STREAK, BEAT JETS  </P> <P> The Toronto Maple Leafs ended a six-game losing streak with a 5-2 victory over  the Winnipeg Jets Monday night and ruined Ed Olczyk's return to Maple Leaf  Gardens.  </P> <P> The Maple Leafs traded Olczyk and Mark Osborne to the Jets Saturday for  defenseman Dave Ellett and forward Paul Fenton.  </P> <P> Olczyk's first shift in the second minute of the first period was greeted with  polite applause from the announced crowd of 15,612.  </P> <P> The crowd gave Olczyk a mixed review when he snapped Osborne's pass over Jeff  Reese's glove at 5:27 of the second period to slice Toronto's lead to 2-1.  </P> <P> Toronto's Doug Shedden, who has spent most of the last four seasons in the  minors, scored his first NHL goal since 1986 at 7:54 of the first period.  Shedden scored again at 10:50 to make it 2-0, and Vincent Damphousse and  linemate Dan Marois combined to make it 3-1 at 17:46 of the second period.  </P> <P> The Leafs, turning in their best defensive effort of the season, outshot  Winnipeg, 33-23.  </P></p>

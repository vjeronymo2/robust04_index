Preliminary-proposals shall be considered as meeting the deadline if they are either: (1) received on or before the deadline date or, (2) postmarked on or before the deadline date. Preliminary-proposals which do not meet the deadline will be considered late applications and may not be considered. The preliminarily-accepted Showcase Demonstrations are projected to be announced by approximately April, 1995 and will be asked by DOE to provide final-proposals. The final proposals scheduled due date is approximately May, 1995. DOE is expected to finalize Showcase Demonstration project selection by approximately June, 1995. The initial Showcase Demonstration Workshop is scheduled to take place in June, 1995. It is envisioned that selected projects will have a duration of no more than 18 months, and therefore, projects are expected to be completed (the project's costs and benefits defined and validated) by November, 1996. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> <!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=94 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=69 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=50 g=1 f=1 -->   <USDEPT>DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY</USDEPT>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=18 g=1 f=1 -->  <USBUREAU>Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy</USBUREAU> <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=55 g=1 f=1 --> Motor Challenge Showcase Demonstration Projects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <AGENCY> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> AGENCY: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Department of Energy. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </AGENCY> <ACTION> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ACTION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Notice of extension for submitting Showcase Demonstration project proposals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=59 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </ACTION> <SUMMARY> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUMMARY: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  On Friday, October 7, 1994, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) published a notice inviting participation in Motor Challenge Showcase Demonstration Projects (59 FR 51186). DOE is interested in obtaining proposals from industrial electric motor system end users for projects that are intended to demonstrate and ``showcase'' electric motor system energy efficiency, productivity, and environmental improvement in varied industrial or municipal facilities and settings. Projects selected by DOE will become ``Showcase Demonstrations'' and are part of a larger, Federally-sponsored (DOE) program that is an industry-driven collaborative effort called MOTOR CHALLENGE. The experiences and successful results to be gained from the Showcase Demonstrations will be used to encourage other U.S. industrial companies with similar applications to adopt efficient electric motor systems, and therefore, to increase the market penetration of efficient electric motor systems on a widespread basis within the U.S. Todays notice announces an extension for the submission of Motor Challenge Showcase Demonstration Project proposals. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  The extended dates to guarantee consideration are: preliminary proposals must be received by March 1, 1995.

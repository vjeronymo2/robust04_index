			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Gilts pay the price It is a measure of the heightened sensitivity of bond markets that yesterday's mixed bag of UK economic statistics sent gilts into a spin. An unexpected rise in average earnings was the culprit. But since there is no sign of upward drift in pay settlements it would be premature to diagnose the return of the British disease. Year-end bonuses and overtime may be the less threatening explanation, in which case yesterday's rise in gilt yields was overdone. There was certainly nothing in the labour market data to suggest that workers have employers over a barrel. Employment in manufacturing, where average earnings growth was strongest, actually fell in the final quarter of last year. Productivity improvements continue to flow through in an encouraging manner. While the fall in headline unemployment must be a relief to the government after January's disappointment, there are still lingering doubts about how many full-time jobs are being created. Together with weak retail sales in February, that doubt might incline the chancellor more strongly towards another cut in interest rates before tax increases take effect next month. Good news on retail prices next week could provide the peg. The danger must be that another rate cut will fray nerves about inflation in the gilts market and bring forward the moment when rates will have to rise. Since the yield on 10-year gilts is already 115 basis points above German bunds, UK bonds already look good value. Unless investors come round to this point of view, funding next year's borrowing requirement could prove tricky.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Pei Jianfeng: "Technology Exports Rise 13 Percent"] </F>   [Text] China's exports of machinery and electronics jumped  by 13 percent to $22.5 billion last year, according to  statistics from the General Administration of Customs.    Machinery and electronics are now China's second largest  source of hard currency, after textiles.    Machinery and electronics products accounted for 24.5  percent  of all exports last year, compared with 6.1 percent in 1986.    Although the 13 percent growth rate is impressive, Chinese  officials are still not satisfied: From 1986 to 1992, machinery  and electronics exports grew by an average of 42 percent each  year.    A senior official with the State Economic and Trade  Commission attributed last year's slower growth to the brisk  domestic market, which dampened producers' enthusiasm for  exports.    The rising costs of raw materials and energy also reduced  exporters' competitive edge against other countries.    Promoting exports of machinery and electronics is a priority  of the government.    The government hopes to increase such exports to $30 billion  by 1995, the official said. The figure is expected to reach $60  billion by the turn of the century, making machinery and  electronics the country's No. 1 source of hard currency.    In 15 years, planners hope exports will amount to $150  billion.    To reach this ambitious goal, the official said, the  machinery and electronics industries should develop some  mainstay export products, such as factory machinery, ships and  automobiles.    Besides traditional export markets, Chinese manufacturers  should also explore new markets in Latin America, the Middle  East and Africa.    The official with the State Economic and Trade Commission  said the government will use financial incentives to help  stimulate future exports of machinery and electronics.    Banks and financial institutions will provide more long-term  loans under preferential terms to support the export of factory  machinery, aircraft and ships.    Establishment of a national import and export bank may also  improve the competitiveness of Chinese exports.    The country's Chamber of Imports and Exports of Machinery  and  Electronics Products intends to play a bigger role in  maintaining export orders.    Domestic exporters, meanwhile, are encouraged to use foreign  manufacturers' technology, designs, brands and marketing  networks.</p>

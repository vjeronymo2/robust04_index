			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / West Australian politician charged MR RAY O'Connor, a former West Australian state premier, was charged yesterday with stealing and criminal defamation as part of a state corruption investigation, Reuter reports from Perth. Mr O'Connor, premier in late 1982 and early 1983, was charged with one count of stealing and two counts of criminal defamation. He was released on his own recognisance and will appear in court on Friday when formal charges will be read. Police allege he stole a cheque for ADollars 25,000 (Pounds 11,300) from the Western Australian Liberal Party in April 1984 and criminally defamed Mr George Cash, now the Western Australian mines minister, between March and April 1987. If found guilty, he could face a maximum jail term of seven years. Mr O'Connor succeeded Sir Charles Court as premier in late 1982, but his Liberal party government was ejected from office in February 1983 by the Labor party under Mr Brian Burke. Mr Burke also faces criminal charges in a separate case and will stand trial in June on four counts related to ADollars 17,000 in overseas travel expenses. Prosecutors allege that Mr Burke, who was later Australian ambassador to Ireland, claimed the expenses even though the travel was paid for by the state. They say that he used the money to repay an overdraft.</p>

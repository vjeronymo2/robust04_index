			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / Wounds run deep: America's racial tensions are at snapping point I recently visited Monticello, Thomas Jefferson's mountainside home in Charlottesville, Virginia. The graceful villa commands fine views over rolling countryside and seems the perfect shrine for a statesman steeped in the liberal values of the 18th century Enlightenment. Reading the glossy brochure for visitors, however, I came across the curious word 'dependencies'. Every plantation, it said, needed 'dependencies to provide the many services required for the operation of the house and farm'. The word, of course, is a euphemism for slaves: even today Americans recoil from the thought that Jefferson, the man who declared all men equal, lived in such glorious style only because he owned scores of slaves. The US has come a long way since Jefferson's day. But the hypocrisy of America's founding fathers has many echoes in modern society. The nation's laws proclaim the equality of the races, but every economic and social indicator points to continuing inequality. For America's black community, the acquittal by an all-white jury of the white policemen in the Rodney King trial is just the latest proof that the 'system' is rigged. Nobody believes that a jury would have reached the same verdict had Mr King been white. In trying to understand continuing racial tension, it is crucial to recall that serious attempts to address black grievances are extremely recent. The Civil War of 1861-65 ended official slavery, but blacks remained effectively subjugated in the south for another century. It is astonishing to think that as recently as the early 1960s, during the presidency of John F Kennedy, blacks in the south faced South African-style apartheid. Many of the parents of the Los Angeles rioters will vividly remember the days when southern blacks were prevented from voting, obliged to eat at segregated lunch counters and forced to sit at the back of buses. In parts of the US, therefore, this is the first generation of blacks to enjoy the basic civil rights long taken for granted elsewhere in the civilised world. Blacks have made economic and social progress since riots shook US cities in the late 1960s. The most encouraging sign is the emergence of a black middle class. The War on Poverty launched by President Lyndon Johnson helped enormously - not because Great Society social programmes worked particularly well but because they involved a huge expansion of federal and state government payrolls. Blacks gained many of the new white-collar positions, thus entering the middle class. In the private sector, blacks have made less progress. They represent 12 per cent of the population but account for only 3 per cent of physicians and lawyers. Nearly a quarter of buses, however, are driven by blacks. The relative success of a minority of blacks, moreover, masks daunting problems for the majority. The median household income of blacks is still only about 60 per cent that of whites - almost exactly the same ratio as in 1967. The proportion below the official poverty line has fallen from about 42 per cent to 32 per cent, but this is still nearly three times the white poverty rate. Economic deprivation on its own might be manageable. But despondency about the condition of black America reflects a growing awareness that blacks form the core of nearly every social problem. Take the issue of family breakdown. Some 56 per cent of black families are headed by single women, three times the ratio for whites. The figures on crime are no less gloomy. Blacks account for 45 per cent of the total prison population - four times the ratio suggested by their relative share of the population. They account for 43 per cent of arrests for rape, 55 per cent of solved murders and 69 per cent of reported robberies. More young blacks are in jail, or on parole or probation than in college. These crime figures perhaps help explain why the white suburban jury in the Rodney King case decided that any level of violence by the police is justified. Middle-class whites long ago fled the cities for the suburbs. But obsessional concern for personal security continues to rule the lives of many affluent whites, who appear oblivious to the fact that the bulk of crime is black on black. The perplexing problem is how to move forward. In a recent Washington Post poll, 85 per cent of blacks and 79 per cent of whites rejected the view that discrimination against blacks was no longer a problem. Liberals respond by demanding that greater efforts be made to 'atone' for the original sin of slavery. They support affirmative action programmes which encourage colleges and companies to take blacks even when better qualified whites have applied. Some middle-class blacks, however, have begun to challenge the wisdom of such policies. An eloquent exposition of the new conservatism is given in The Character of Our Race, a recent collection of essays by Mr Shelby Steele, a black literature professor. Mr Steele's life history parallels that of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. Like Mr Justice Thomas, he overcame extreme deprivation, achieved academic and professional success and then found himself estranged from his own race. His argument is that the civil rights movement of the 1960s was essential in its day: without confrontation, blacks might never have achieved full civil liberties. However, aggressive 'we are not treated properly' attitudes are no longer appropriate, because they solidify blacks in their historical role as victim. In the view of Mr Steele and other black conservatives, most formal obstacles to black advancement have been removed. The main problem now is blacks' own lack of faith in themselves. They must thus accept more personal responsibility for their own advancement and stop relying on collective action by pressure groups. There is some truth in his message, harsh though it will sound to most ears. One of the striking findings of sociologists is that most blacks do not believe the 'American dream' applies to them. In schools black children who study hard are jeered at by their peers for 'acting white'. Perversely, it seems that you can prove yourself in many poor black neighbourhoods only by failing. The public sector could be less passive. It would make sense to pursue policies that favour not a particular race but compensate for big and growing differences in income and wealth. The most effective policy for influencing life chances is education. In a nation that purports to provide equal educational opportunities for all, it is indefensible that the funding of schools should be so heavily dependent on the wealth of particular neighbourhoods. Violence in response to what appears a travesty of justice cannot be justified. But the fires in Los Angeles must be seen, at least in part, as a reproach to mainstream America. President George Bush talks of a kinder, gentler America, but the truth is that the nation has yet to heal wounds that date from the earliest days of the republic.</p>

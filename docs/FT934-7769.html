			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / International Company News: Aoki holds talks on hotels sell-off AOKI, a medium-sized Japanese construction company which owns the Westin Hotels chain, said that it was in discussion with a number of parties with the aim of selling its Westin interests in North America. The companies being put up for sale include the operating company of the Westin Hotels chain in North America and the North American hotels. Sale of those businesses would in effect end Aoki's hotel business in the US, which makes up about two-thirds of the company's hotel interests. Aoki plans to use the funds it raises through the sale of most of its stock in the Westin Hotels chains and the North American operating company based in Seattle to reduce its debt burden, which totalled over Y300bn (Dollars 2.8bn) at the end of March this year. It hopes to be able to conclude a deal as early as before the end of the year. The construction company also plans to sell its holding in Westin International Europe, the operating company based in Hamburg, Germany, which runs some of its North American hotels and hotels in Europe, if conditions are suitable. Aoki acquired the Westin Hotels and Resorts chains jointly with a US company in 1988 for Dollars 1.35bn of which the Japanese group paid Y1.1bn. The company is not revealing what kind of price it is looking for the hotels. Aoki has extensive operations outside of Japan and operates hotels in Brazil, Panama, Taiwan and Shanghai as well as the US and Germany. With the business downturn in the west, however, the company is looking to concentrate its energies on the growing Asian market.</p>

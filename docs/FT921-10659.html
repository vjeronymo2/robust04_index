			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: PT Inco Indonesia slides PT INTERNATIONAL Nickel Indonesia (PT Inco), which was floated on the Jakarta stock market in April 1990, has posted net earnings for 1991 down 16.6 per cent at USDollars 57m, or 23 cents a share, compared with Dollars 68.4m, or 28 cents, in 1990. PT Inco, 58 per cent owned by Inco of Canada, said the downturn was mainly caused by lower realised nickel prices - Dollars 2.91 a pound compared with Dollars 3.12 - and a higher provision for deferred taxes at Dollars 16.55m, against Dollars 2.36m a year earlier. This was only partly offset by increased nickel deliveries, up to 75.7m lb from 60.2m lb. The company's production of nickel in matte, an intermediate product, reached a record 75.9m lb, against 59.6m lb in 1990 and 64m lbs in 1989. PT Inco's stocks of nickel in matte at the end of the year were 1.3m lb, compared with 1.2m at the end of 1990.</p>

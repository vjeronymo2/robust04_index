			<p><P> August 3, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> F-14 TOMCAT FIGHTER CRASHES INTO OCEAN; 2 CREWMEN RESCUED  </P> <P> An F-14 Tomcat fighter based at Miramar Naval Air Station plunged into the sea  off Point Loma on Wednesday, but both crewmen ejected safely and were rescued,  authorities said.  </P> <P> It was the fourth crash of a Miramar-based F-14 since December, and the 102nd  since the fighter was introduced into service in 1972. Just last week, a  Miramar-based F-14 crashed near San Clemente Island. Both crewmen ejected  safely.  </P> <P> Navy spokesman Cmdr. Doug Schamp said it did not appear that there was any  connection between the two crashes, both of which are under investigation.  </P> <P> Wednesday's crash occurred about 6 p.m., Schamp said, after the aircraft  developed problems while on a routine exercise from the carrier Carl Vinson.  The pilot was attempting an emergency landing at North Island Naval Air  Station, Schamp said, when the decision was made to eject.  </P></p>

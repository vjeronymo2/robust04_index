			<p><P> September 12, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> TALE OF 2 BUREAUCRACIES: 1 BOTTLENECK, COMING UP  </P> <P> Commuters who travel the Olsen-Madera Road corridor, which connects California  118 and 23, may have been wondering lately why there is a bottleneck on the  border of Thousand Oaks and Simi Valley, where a road-widening project appears  to have stopped prematurely. The answer lies in municipal bureaucracies.  </P> <P> Thousand Oaks recently completed a road-widening project that took 18 months to  finish and cost $2.7 million, according to that city's traffic engineer, Jano  Bagdanian. Thus, in Thousand Oaks, Olsen Road is a four-lane divided highway  that smoothly flows to and from California 23.  </P> <P> In Simi Valley, however, where Olsen becomes Madera Road, an estimated 600-foot  stretch of Madera annoyingly narrows on the westbound side from two lanes to  one near the Thousand Oaks border -- causing a rush-hour bottleneck. Traffic  Engineer Bill Golubics says that's because the developers of Wood Ranch, a  large residential project on the south side of Madera Road, are responsible for  the improvement but aren't scheduled to begin work until next year. Plans call  for the road to eventually be four lanes, two in each direction, as in Thousand  Oaks.  </P> <P> "We're working with them to expedite the process," Golubics said of the private  developers. "It would've been nice to get four lanes in place at the same time"  as Thousand Oaks' recently completed project, "but it just didn't work out that  way."  </P></p>

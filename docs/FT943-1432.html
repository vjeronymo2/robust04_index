			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Yeltsin expected to press for Caspian gas rights Russian President Boris Yeltsin is expected to argue strongly that Russia has a strong and legitimate national interest in the exploitation of oil and gas in the Caspian sea region, during weekend talks with Mr John Major, the British prime minister, at Chequers, the premier's country retreat, writes Anthony Robinson. BP and British Gas are among large British companies negotiating deals in Azerbaijan and elsewhere in oil- and gas-rich former Soviet central Asia. Mr Yeltsin is also expected to outline the contents of a policy speech setting out Russia's attitude towards arms control and security issues, which he will deliver at the United Nations in New York next week. Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, will hold separate talks on Bosnia and other international issues with Mr Andrei Kozyrev, his Russian counterpart. Russia's new ambassador to London, Mr Anatoly Adamishin, a former deputy foreign minister and veteran career diplomat, will take part in the talks. See Page 10 and Weekend FT Page XXII</p>

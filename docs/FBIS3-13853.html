			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cairo, 21 Mar (MENA)--Arab League Secretary General  Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid has stated that the sudden developments  in the Arab-Israeli conflict, particularly after the al-Ibrahimi  Mosque massacre, require more work than ever to achieve Arab  reconciliation and unify the Arab fold to unite the Arab  political will to enable the Arabs to deal with all the  challenges and dangers, primarily Israel's continuing occupation  of the Arab territories, including holy Jerusalem.    In a statement today marking the Arab League's 49th  anniversary, which the League will celebrate tomorrow, Tuesday,  'Abd-al-Majid said the challenges require our nation to rise  above its wounds and pain and restore Arab solidarity on firm  foundations based on frankness and openness with the eagerness  to stick to the goals and principles of the Arab League Charter.    He asked the Security Council and the two countries  sponsoring the peace conference to quickly implement Security  Council Resolution 904 denouncing the al-Ibrahimi Mosque  massacre. He also called for providing the necessary  international protection for the Palestinian people in the  occupied territories, applying the Fourth Geneva Conventions to  them, disarming the Jewish settlers, and removing the Israeli  settlements, which form a new impediment to the peace talks.    He appealed to the Security Council not to use two  yardsticks  and to quickly implement the UN Charter's provisions so that  peace, development, and fruitful cooperation in the Middle East  will materialize. He reiterated the Arab identity of Jerusalem  and the commitment to implement international legitimacy  Resolutions 242, 252, 338, 425, and 465 on the Arab-Israeli  conflict.    He said last year's events have shown that seeking the  arbitration of the UN and Arab League Charters is the ideal way  to resolve numerous conflicts that face our Arab nation. He  also stressed his confidence that the restoration of Arab  solidarity and joint action forms a firm basis to enhance Arab  capability to face up to the current challenges and ambitions.    'Abd-al-Majid called for unifying the will of Arabs toward  enhancing and strengthening the Arab League structure by setting  up an Arab court of justice as an effective tool to peacefully  resolve conflicts involving Arab countries. He noted that had  such a court existed before 2 August 1990, the Arab nation would  have avoided the serious ramifications of the Gulf crisis the  effects of which we are still suffering.    He said he hoped the Arab League Council could, at its next  session on Saturday, achieve this mechanism--an Arab court of  justice--so that the Arab nation might handle the dangers and  challenges it is facing and that affect the structure of  pan-Arab security.    The Arab League secretary general said: The anniversary of  the Arab League, which was founded in 1945, the oldest regional  organization set up after World War II, represents an important  stage in Arab history. This requires us to consider being frank  and open so that we may learn a lesson that will help us to  sense the steps to take at a time when the Arab nation faces  developments of a strategic nature in the international arena,  primarily reorganizing economics on new bases.</p>

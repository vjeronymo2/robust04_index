			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Technical recovery helps share prices THE MEREST whiff of base rate optimism from the London money markets was enough to fuel a technical rally in UK share prices yesterday. The FT-SE Index briefly regained the 2,500 mark, closing 21 points up and only just below this benchmark number in the absence of distraction from Wall Street which was closed for the July 4 holiday. Equities opened lower following weakness in the Dow Industrial Average overnight and the continuing worries over the UK economy and the faltering record of new share issues in the London stock market. But a dip of 8.6 in the Footsie was quickly reversed upwards when the Bank of England's actions in the money markets gave some stimulus to hopes of another early cut in UK base rates. With the enthusiasm taken up in the stock index futures market, the equity market advanced by 24 points to touch 2,500.1. Prices for short-dated government bonds turned higher, also reflecting base rate speculation. Long dated bonds also gained ground while, for good measure, Index-linked stocks joined in the general upturn. However, many strategists took a cautious view, and interest rate optimism soon cooled down. The stock market held on to its gains, encouraged by firmness in other European centres, and by bear closing operations as traders bought stock to meet selling commitments entered into earlier this week. The final reading showed the FT-SE Index at 2,497.1 (plus 21 points). This indicates a loss of 37 points or about 1.5 per cent on the Footsie over the week. Selling has not been heavy - Seaq turnover totalled 429.5m shares yesterday - but investors have been distressed by persistent economic gloom reflected in downgradings of corporate profit estimates by brokers and by difficulties with successive share flotations. The withdrawal of the GPA flotation, failure of The Telegraph issue and the reduced pricing of the MFI Furniture sale have all cast clouds over the stock market. However, many market strategists have argued that the stock market has become oversold and that share prices represent good value at these levels in terms of the yield relative against the UK bond market. These optimisms were heartened by the rapidity with which the Footsie regained the 2,500 mark yesterday. But a question mark now hangs over the outlook on Wall Street. Retail business in UK equities has begun to recover after falling sharply as economic and corporate gloom discouraged investors.</p>

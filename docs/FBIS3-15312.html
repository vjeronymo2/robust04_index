Next, a discussion on the  new draft constitution was resumed. In particular, the  discussion focused on the status of the official language in the  Republic of Belarus. The deputies adopted an article of the  draft constitution, which provides Belarusian with the status of  the official language, while Russian is confirmed as the  language of interethnic intercourse [mizhnatsyyanalnyya znosiny].    Following the discussion, the deputies adopted Article 40 of  the draft constitution, which provides the citizens of the  Republic of Belarus with a guarantee of the right to work -- the  most dignified way of man's self-realization -- that is, the  right to choose a profession, job, and employment in accordance  with personal ability, education, and vocational training as  well as with due regard to social needs; it also includes the  right to healthy and secure working conditions.    The deputies also adopted Article 66 of the draft  constitution, which stipulates the election procedure in our  state, as well as Article 73 concerning a referendum in the  Republic. A referendum, reads this article, shall be organized  by the Supreme Soviet of the Republic of Belarus following a  request by the Republic's president or by a body of no less than  450,000 citizens eligible to vote. Today's session proceedings  positively resolved the question of changes and amendments to  the basic law of our state.    One more deputy chairman of the Supreme Soviet was also  elected today. This honor was extended to People's Deputy  Uladzimir Vasilyevich Rusakevich, deputy head of the executive  committee of the Brest council of people's deputies.

			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / NatWest agrees return of shares NATIONAL WESTMINSTER Bank yesterday agreed to return voluntarily to the Maxwell pension funds Pounds 25m of shares in Teva, an Israeli pharmaceutical group, which were pledged as security for a Dollars 27.3m loan. The bank has also agreed to pay legal costs - believed to be about Pounds 100,000 - incurred in its tussle over ownership with Robson Rhodes, liquidator to Bishopsgate Investment Management, manager and trustee of the Maxwell pension funds. Mr Neil Cooper, head of insolvency at Robson Rhodes, said legal action to recover other shares from three foreign banks was likely to take many months. Agreement for the return of the Teva shares was delayed by NatWest's requirement for Robson Rhodes to substantiate its claim of ownership. It was also stalled by a counter-claim from Arthur Andersen, administrator to the private Maxwell companies. Andersen believed it might own the Teva shares because they were transferred through the Robert Maxwell Group, part of the private empire, but the firm agreed last week to drop this claim. NatWest said the shares were taken in good faith after written assurances from the directors of the private Maxwell companies that the shares were beneficially owned by Robert Maxwell Group. Efforts to recover other parts of the estimated Pounds 448m in assets taken from the Maxwell pension funds is likely to be considerably slower. Up to half of these assets have been pledged as security against loans to Robert Maxwell's private interests from three banks - Banque Nationale de Paris, Credit Suisse and Lehman Brothers.</p>

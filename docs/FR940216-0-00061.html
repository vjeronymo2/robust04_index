			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Sixth, the contribution of each remaining term to the model's explanatory power was estimated, and those terms whose contribution summed to less than one percent were deleted (i.e., the retained terms accounted for 99 percent of the explanatory power of the model) to simplify the form of the model without materially reducing its ability to predict the emissions impact of fuel modifications. This step was not taken during development of the NPRM model.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, the resulting models for each technology group within the set of normal emitting vehicles were consolidated into a single equation using a random balance approximation. The details of that approximation are given in Section IV.A of the RIA. This step was not taken during development of the NPRM model.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The results of EPA's modeling efforts confirms the importance of technology group and emitter class distinctions, as can be seen by examining the differences in the exhaust emission equations for specific normal emitter technology groups or for normal and higher emitter class categories (as discussed in greater detail in the RIA). Efforts to reduce the number of technology group categories for normal emitters were not successful. Efforts to subdivide higher emitters by their emission characteristics such as exhaust hydrocarbon to NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  ratio did not improve the quality of EPA's higher emitter model. However, as discussed above, EPA found it unnecessary to separate higher emitters by technology group. This modification reflects EPA's belief, supported by preliminary field information, that one or more emission control components on higher emitters tend to be malfunctioning, which renders a classification scheme based on vehicle equipment questionable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Exhaust Model  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As was discussed in the April 1992 and February 1993 proposals, the weight assigned to each technology group or emitter class for modeling purposes was set equal to its contribution to in-use emissions for each pollutant. The weight assigned to each emitter class was set equal to its projected contribution to in-use emissions. The weighting factor assigned to normal emitters was then broken down further by technology group, again according to their projected contribution to in-use emissions. These estimates and projections are essentially unchanged from the February 1993 proposal, although minor changes have been made to reflect more complete information about the fraction of 1990 sales accounted for by each technology group. The rationale for, derivation of, and renormalization of the weighting factors themselves are discussed in more detail in the RIA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Various commenters indicated that they considered EPA's previously proposed models were too complex. In response, the Agency has modified its analysis method in several ways. The resulting method, described in Section IV.B.2, results in exhaust emission models containing two equations for each pollutant instead of as many as sixteen separate equations, as was the case for the model proposed in February 1993. Each equation also has far fewer terms than the February 1993 equations. However, EPA does not believe that today's less complicated complex model is less accurate than the complex models presented at public workshops or in the February proposal. This belief is based on the models' comparable explanatory power (as reflected in their similar R2) and the superior accuracy of today's model in accounting for the emission effects seen in the vehicle testing programs that comprise the complex model database. Today's VOC and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  models are based on the most accurate of the three sets of models included in EPA's July 14, 1993 docket submittal, while also taking into account relevant comments regarding specific aspects of the models. Today's toxics models are a further simplification of the models included in the July 1993 docket submittal in response to comments received by EPA on its docket submittal. These points are discussed more fully in Section IV.A of the RIA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The specific equations that comprise the complex model can be found in section 80.45 of the regulations for this rule. Their derivation is discussed in detail in Section IV.A of the RIA. The range of parameter values for which these equations are valid is discussed in Section D and in Section IV.D of the RIA. As discussed in Section V, refiners are required to submit data to augment the model if they wish to certify fuels with properties that fall outside this range as reformulated gasolines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

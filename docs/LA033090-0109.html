			<p><P> March 30, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAKES RACE GIVES RON MCANALLY CHANCE TO VISIT OLD KENTUCKY HOME  </P> <P> The last time Ron McAnally did any running in these parts, he was trying to  escape from the orphanage where he had been dropped off when he was 5.  </P> <P> Twice, the young McAnally attempted to run away from the Covington Protestant  Children's Home. Once, he changed his mind and went back. The other time, he  was picked up in downtown Covington and returned to the orphanage.  </P> <P> "It wasn't easy getting out, either," McAnally remembered Thursday. "I had to  cross a slate roof, and there was a two-story drop to the ground."  </P> <P> McAnally, 57, will do some more "running" in Northern Kentucky Saturday. Tight  Spot, one of his candidates for this year's Kentucky Derby, is the 5-1 third  choice, behind favorites Summer Squall and Bright Again, in the $500,000 Jim  Beam Stakes at Turfway Park.  </P> <P> McAnally was born in Covington, not far from the old Latonia Race Course and  only a 10-minute drive from Turfway. His mother died of tuberculosis when he  was 5. His father, who had four other young children, worked as a dispatcher  for a cab company in Cincinnati and couldn't handle the family. The five  children were sent to the orphanage.  </P> <P> McAnally spent 12 years there. His memories of the place are generally good,  but one of his early jobs was enough to send him over the wall twice.  </P> <P> "I was the dishwasher," he said. "It was just me and one other guy. We had to  wash the dishes for everybody -- 200 kids -- three times a day."  </P> <P> McAnally smiled and said: "You know, I'm still washing them."  </P> <P> His wife, Debbie, is in Europe, visiting one of their daughters who is studying  on a college exchange program. Debbie is a 50% owner of Silver Ending, another  Derby hopeful who may run in the Blue Grass Stakes on April 14 at Keeneland in  Lexington, Ky., 75 miles south of here.  </P> <P> McAnally didn't have to wash dishes Thursday night. He and his two sisters, who  are married to business executives in this area, went out to dinner. McAnally's  brothers live in Southern California, one working for the Horsemen's Benevolent  and Protective Assn. and the other running a restaurant near Del Mar.  </P> <P> "It was not the perfect way to grow up," McAnally said of the orphanage. "But  at least we had the advantage of being family and all being in there together.  You hear about families where the kids are fighting all the time, even when  they grow up. We're so close that I can't imagine any of us ever having a  fight."  </P> <P> McAnally's father was in his 40s when he died of a heart attack. Joe, one of  Ron's brothers, was the only child who lived with the father after leaving the  orphanage.  </P> <P> McAnally has become a successful California trainer and is eligible for  election to horse racing's Hall of Fame in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., this year,  but he is mindful of his roots. He wrote a check just the other day for the  orphanage where he grew up. And today, while visiting Keeneland, he'll look in  on John Henry, who at 15 is a leading attraction at the Kentucky Horse Park.  With McAnally as trainer, John Henry won horse-of-the-year titles in 1981 and  '84, and the grass-loving gelding was instrumental in McAnally being voted  trainer of the year in 1981. John Henry is also on the Hall of Fame ballot this  year.  </P> <P> McAnally has a picture at home in Pasadena of him and his grandfather, who  introduced him to racing at Gulfstream Park in Florida when he was about 6.  </P> <P> After an Air Force hitch, McAnally tried studying engineering at the University  of Cincinnati, but admits that he wasn't much of a student. He wound up living  in the San Fernando Valley with an uncle, trainer Reggie Cornell. McAnally  started as a chauffeur for Cornell, who quit driving after his brother was  seriously injured in an auto accident in Canada. But McAnally wound up breaking  Silky Sullivan, the charismatic, Cornell-trained Santa Anita Derby winner who  bombed out, at 2-1, in the 1958 Kentucky Derby.  </P> <P> McAnally has started four horses in the Kentucky Derby, finishing fourth with  Super Moment in 1980, fourth with Water Bank and 13th with Cassaleria in 1982  and fifth with Hawkster last year.  </P> <P> The best young horse McAnally has ever trained, however, was Donut King. He  bought him for $16,000 at a Del Mar yearling sale for Verne Winchell, the  doughnut man. As a 2-year-old, Donut King won the Champagne Stakes at Aqueduct,  beating the intrepid Jaipur and Crimson Satan, who was voted the division  champion.  </P> <P> The following year, Donut King probably should have won the Wood Memorial, his  final prep for the Derby. McAnally told his jockey, Manny Ycaza, that Sunrise  County, the Wood favorite, had a terrible habit of lugging out in the stretch.  Ycaza waited as long as he could before trying to pass Sunrise County, but  Donut King still got caught in the drift and finished third, beaten by less  than a length. Sunrise County was disqualified from first to third, and the  victory went to Admiral's Voyage, who had finished second.  </P> <P> Full of confidence, McAnally sent Donut King to Churchill Downs. The Monday  before the Derby, after working the race distance of 1 1/4 miles, Donut King  came back lame and his career was over.  </P> <P> Now McAnally is at Turfway Park for the first time, chasing another Derby with  another Verne Winchell horse, Tight Spot. When the trainer got here, memories  of that Northern Kentucky orphanage and Donut King's Derby miss were almost  bound to cross at that intersection of the mind.  </P> <P> Horse Racing Notes  </P> <P> Summer Squall, the 8-5 favorite in the 1 1/8-mile Jim Beam Stakes, drew the No.  1 post position, which is no longer considered a disadvantage at Turfway Park.  . . . Pat Day, who has won with all three of his previous Jim Beam mounts, will  ride Summer Squall. Outside them, in order, will be Sluki, Bright Again,  Yonder, Seven Spades, Power Lunch, Top Snob, Fighting Fantasy, Private School  and Tight Spot. . . . Corey Black will ride Tight Spot, and Alex Solis is in  from Santa Anita to ride Power Lunch, the Wayne Lukas trainee who broke his  maiden on March 8 at Oaklawn Park. . . . With rain forecast for today and  Saturday, there's a chance of an off track.  </P> <P> Three 3-year-olds who ran earlier in California -- Tarascon, Individualist I  and Hawaiian Pass -- are entered in Saturday's Rebel, a 1 1/16-mile race at  Oaklawn Park. Tarascon is the 2-1 favorite in an 11-horse field. . . . Smelly,  a prominent 3-year-old, will face nine opponents Saturday at Garden State Park  in the Cherry Hill Mile. . . . Brown Bess heads the five-horse field Saturday  at Santa Anita in the $200,000 Santa Barbara Handicap, a 1 1/4-mile grass race  for fillies and mares. Also running are Royal Touch, Estrella Fuega, Double  Wedge and Isabella Ra.  </P></p>

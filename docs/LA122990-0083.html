			<p><P> December 29, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COURT RULING ASKED ON LEGALITY OF LUNGREN APPOINTMENT OF STIRLING AS CHIEF  DEPUTY  </P> <P> Atty. Gen.-elect Dan Lungren asked the state Court of Appeal on Friday to  decide whether the man he wants to be his chief deputy can legally serve in  that office. Earlier this week, John K. Van de Kamp, the current state attorney  general, argued that Lungren's choice for his top aide -- Sacramento Superior  Court Judge David Stirling -- could not take the job because the state  Constitution prevents judges from leaving the bench during their terms to take  another public office.  </P> <P> Contending that Van de Kamp has misinterpreted the Constitution, Lungren and  Stirling asked the court to settle the matter so that Stirling can assume his  new post on Jan. 7 when Lungren takes office. The suit asks the court to direct  state Controller Gray Davis to ignore the Van de Kamp opinion and begin paying  Stirling's salary as chief deputy.  </P></p>

			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Paying into a pension I AM BEING made redundant and am taking early retirement after 26 years' pensionable service. I might then work as a part-time consultant. As a higher-rate taxpayer, can I start another pension plan? If so, what percentage of my earnings can I place in it? The contributions that you can pay to a personal pension policy in respect of your present and future non-pensionable earnings (eg. consultancy work) are not affected by your past pension rights but only your age at the beginning of the year of assessment. If you are 51 or over, you can pay 30 per cent, 56 or over (35 per cent), and 61 or over (40 per cent). No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

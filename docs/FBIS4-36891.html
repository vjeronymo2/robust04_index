			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Fatah Central Committee Member 'Abbas </F> Zaki Tells AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT: My Contacts With Opposition  Factions Aimed at Averting Internal Sedition for Which Israelis  Are Planning"]    [Excerpts] Tunis, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Fatah Central  Committee member 'Abbas Zaki, who has just returned from a  mission to Amman and Damascus assigned to him by Palestinian  President Yasir 'Arafat, has denied reports that he recently  played a mediation role between 'Arafat and the factions opposed  to the Palestinian-Israeli peace agreement with a view to  persuading them to participate in the [Palestinian] National  Authority. He said that "these reports are absolutely baseless."    He added that "the contacts and talks he held with Hamas  [Islamic Resistance Movement] in Damascus and with the  Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, the Popular  Front for the Liberation of Palestine [PFLP], the PFLP-General  Command, and other independent figures were aimed at finding a  formula for coexistence among the Palestinian forces so as to  spare the Palestinian people the internal sedition and massacre  the Israelis are seeking to detonate in Gaza so that it becomes  like southern Lebanon."    In a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, Zaki said that he was  seeking during his contacts in Amman and Damascus to agree with  the Palestinian parties on "a document of honor with which  everyone would comply in the stage ahead." [passage omitted]    Asked about the nature of the future relationship between  Hamas and the Palestinian Authority, Zaki stressed that "Hamas'  refusal to participate in the authority does not mean that it  will not be in the self-rule institutions. The Palestinian  police has welcomed it, and it too has agreed to participate in  the rebuilding process."    He added that the relationship with Hamas is continuing in a  manner that allows agreement on specific issues such as the form  and nature of the next struggle and the ability to spare the  self-rule areas an internal conflict. He pointed out that,  "despite Hamas' refusal to join the authority's formation, the  door of dialogue is still open to it." [passage omitted]    He pointed out that there is information about Israeli  preparations to generate internal sedition in Gaza so that it  becomes like southern Lebanon. They have been planning for that  for some time." [passage omitted]    Zaki said that the factions with which he met in Damascus  "are convinced of the need to work to avoid Palestinian-izing  the conflict." He pointed out that these factions still insist  on the need to torpedo the agreement and its results. And that  the talks with the factions in Damascus "focused on not harming  the internal front and on continuing the democratic dialogue."  [passage omitted]    Concluding his statement, Zaki warned "of an approaching  massacre for which the Israelis are planning." He wondered:  "Should our hands remain tied?" He went on: "We have not  obtained anything in order for us to change our alliances. We  have obtained only 4 percent of the Yigal Allon plan. So we  should not -- on the pretext that powers have been transferred  to us -- play any tyrannical role. We should not fight one  another. The authority should not claim that it has begun to  replace its conflict with Israel with a conflict with the  opposition, which, in turn, should not escape from the Israeli  monster in order to fight the authority."</p>

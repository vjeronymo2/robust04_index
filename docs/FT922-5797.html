			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / Government Bonds: Treasuries buoyed by rise in durable goods orders US Treasury securities rose across the board yesterday, recovering some of the ground lost on Tuesday in the wake of higher oil prices. In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  7/32 at 101 1/8 , yielding 7.895 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was also firmer, up  3/16 at 99 3/4 , yielding 5.242 per cent. The market was buoyed early on by news of a 1.4 per cent increase in durable goods orders during April. Although the headline figure showed a bigger rise than analysts had expected, new orders would have been slightly lower for the month without a big rise in the volatile transportation orders component. Overall, analysts said the figures confirmed that the economic recovery remained sluggish, and they briefly revived hopes that the Federal Reserve may cut interest rates again. The Danish bond market made strong gains yesterday after an opinion poll showed a swing in favour of the Maastricht Treaty on European Union. Hopes that Denmark would ratify the terms of the Maastricht Treaty, thereby paving the way for the convergence of Danish yields, prompted international investors to buy Danish paper. Long-dated government bonds jumped a quarter of a percentage point, with the 9 per cent bond due 2000 rising from 101.00 to 101.25 to yield 8.76 per cent. Denmark holds its referendum on the Maastricht Treaty on Tuesday June 2 and recent opinion polls suggested that Danes would vote against the Treaty. However, a Gallup poll released on Tuesday showed a swing in favour of Maastricht for the first time, with 41 per cent in favour and 39 per cent against the Treaty. 'The market shouldn't get carried away by the opinion polls, especially given that the polls can get it quite wrong,' warned one trader, adding that 'the reaction (to the polls) could be overdone'. Traders said 10-year yield spreads over German government bonds have narrowed slightly since the beginning of April - when negative polls pushed the yield spread to about 95 basis points - to about 87 basis points recently. Elsewhere in Europe, the government bond markets were generally lacklustre ahead of the Ascension Day holiday. German government bonds opened weaker, following the fall in US Treasury bonds overnight, and traded in a narrow range with the Liffe bund futures contract moving between 87.65 and 87.76. The contract closed at 87.70, slightly lower on the day. Traders said the release of cost-of-living data for Bavaria had little impact on the bund market. The month-on-month rise was 0.3 per cent, with a 5 per cent rise year-on-year. Inflation for Germany as a whole is expected to be around 4.5 per cent for May. The UK government bond market ended the day slightly higher, but continued to make rather heavy weather of the latest gilt tranche issued by the Bank of England. Dealers reported little interest in the Pounds 800m tranche of 9 per cent Conversion stock due 2000. 'The market is suffering from indigestion just now, following the large amount of issuance since the election,' warned one trader. The Liffe futures contract traded in a range of 99.14-99.24, and ended the day at 99.19. Japanese government bonds fell yesterday prompted by a drop in the Tokyo stock market, the overnight fall in US Treasury bond prices, higher crude oil prices and the supply of new 10-year bonds at yesterday's auction. The yield on the benchmark No 129 opened at 5.565 per cent, and ended the day at 5.585 per cent after trading in a range of 5.56-5.59 per cent. The finance ministry held its auction of 10-year bonds as expected, and announced a coupon of 5.6 per cent - which is lower than the 5.7 per cent coupon seen on the May issue. The ministry sold Y472.74bn (or 60 per cent of the total Y800bn issue) at an average price of 99.53 to yield 5.673 per cent. The lowest accepted bid at the auction was 99.40, yielding 5.694 per cent. The rest of the issue was placed with the members of the underwriting syndicate. Traders said the fall in the stock market contributed to the generally bearish sentiment, as the Nikkei average index ended down 382.08 points at 17,822.56 yesterday.</p>

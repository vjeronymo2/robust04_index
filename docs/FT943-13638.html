			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Squeeze put on eligibility for council housing The government yesterday unveiled plans to tighten the rules by which the homeless can apply for local authority housing, triggering a furious protest from opposition parties and independent pressure groups. The plans, announced in the Commons by Sir George Young, the housing minister, will mean that certain social groups - including single mothers - will no longer be given priority treatment for accommodation. Some of Sir George's proposals, which could be followed by legislation next year, represent a substantial climbdown from ideas that were floated in a consultation paper produced by the Department of the Environment six months ago. Labour said the plans were 'mean-spirited'. Shelter, the housing charity, said they 'did nothing to increase the supply of affordable rented housing'. Specific groups, including pregnant women and young people, will lose their automatic right to permanent council accommodation. Ministers have regarded the right as unfair to those with 'underlying needs' who are not made a priority. They want most applications to be filtered through a single waiting list. The government also wants local authorities to ensure that applicants for accommodation are 'unintentionally' homeless. Ministers say that a flaw of the present system is that young people deliberately leave home and single women deliberately become pregnant so that they can be eligible for accommodation. Sir George told MPs that vulnerable people would not be 'left to live on the streets or in unsatisfactory accommodation'. But Mr John Battle, his opposition counterpart, said that his statement represented 'an attack on the basic rights to housing provision that not even Mrs Thatcher . . . was prepared to contemplate'. Mrs Sheila McKechnie, the director of Shelter, also criticised the proposals. She said: 'We urge the government not to change the law. This can only mean misery for the thousands of people in this country who are currently homeless or living in poor conditions.' Nevertheless, the government has softened some proposals from those in its consultation paper: Local authorities will still have discretion over how they allocate housing  -providing accommodation for a single year to applicants who are judged to be 'in priority need'. The length of time that local authorities should provide accommodation is longer than had been envisaged. Environment department officials stressed that ministers had wanted to avoid the 'revolving door' syndrome, whereby the homeless are constantly being shunted from one home to another. Councils will have an obligation to extend accommodation to single mothers living in women's hostels, against the recommendations of the consultation paper.</p>

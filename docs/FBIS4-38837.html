			<p>BFN     [Text] The Bank of China branch in Moscow intends to  implement indirect investments into the Russian economy by  granting a 10 Mn dollar credit to several commercial banks this  June, the bank's President Du Wanyu reported to the Financial  Information Agency in Moscow.    He indicated that Russian bankers easily establish contacts  because the interest rate on credits is relatively low.  However, he did not mention its amount.    Since 1994 the Bank of China in Moscow has granted credits  to  its Russian partners amounting to one million dollars.    According to Du Wan You, China's financial circles  attentively follow the political situation in Russia and he sees  his major task in expansion of trade relations between two  countries. Du Wan You's assessment of the prospects of the  liberalization of the access of the foreign banks to Russia was  rather restrained. He believes that it is necessary to first  examine all the nuances of Russian banking legislation.    Viktor Gerashchenko, Chairman of the Central Bank of Russia,  reported early this week that Russian President Boris Yeltsin is  expected to sign a decree on the activity of foreign banks on  the territory of the Russian Federation before June 8, 1994.    Bank of China in Moscow is a joint stock commercial bank  with  an authorized capital totalling 10 million dollars, it was  founded as China's foreign branch bank. The Bank has received a  general licence of the Central Bank of Russia on April 4, 1993.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Moscow, January 14 (XINHUA) -- Russia agreed today  to sell 12 billion U.S. dollars worth of highly enriched uranium  over the next 20 years to the United States, and a senior  Russian official hailed the deal as "a real move towards genuine  nuclear disarmament."    Under the agreement, signed here during the summit meeting  between Russian President Boris Yeltsin and U.S. President Bill  Clinton, the U.S. will buy 500 tons of highly enriched uranium  from dismantled nuclear warheads.    As many as 20,000 nuclear warheads would have to be  dismantled in Russia and Ukraine to provide the agreed amount of  enriched uranium to the United States, which plans to distribute  it for use among its 15 nuclear reactors.    Russia will receive foreign currency from the transaction,  and Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan will share in the  profits.    "The agreement means a real move toward genuine nuclear  disarmament," Russian Atomic Energy Minister Viktor Mikhailov  said, while the U.S. pointed out that this will be the first  time in history that disarmament brings profit to some countries.    Announcement of the uranium sale followed the nuclear  disarmament agreement between the United States, Russia, and  Ukraine signed by Clinton, Yeltsin and Ukrainian President  Leonid Kravchuk earlier today.</p>

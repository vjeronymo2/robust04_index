			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / US has key role to play in peace, says Adams The US could play an instrumental role in helping achieve peace in Northern Ireland, Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, said in Belfast yesterday. Mr Adams told a St Patrick's Day rally that the US Administration was displaying readiness to take a fresh approach to the conflict in spite of sustained British pressure. Mr Adams was speaking before yesterday's meeting in the US between Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, and Mr Bill Clinton, the US president. The Sinn Fein leader said republicans wanted to live in peace and without coercion among their unionist neighbours. He said Sinn Fein neither condoned nor encouraged armed actions and stressed that all parties had to be involved in the current peace process. Mr Adams's stance received a guarded welcome in Washington, with Mr Clinton saying he was 'quite encouraged' that the IRA remained interested in the peace process. Mr Adams's words came 'at a good time', and Mr Clinton added: 'I hope it has a good effect.' Standing with Mr Reynolds at a White House ceremony to mark St Patrick's Day, Mr Clinton said it was 'premature' to discuss the question of issuing another US visa to the Sinn Fein leader. He had no regrets about letting Mr Adams into the US last month - 'because we all have to take a chance for peace' - but indicated that much would depend on what Mr Adams's party did next. 'The issue now is what is going to be the role of Sinn Fein in the ongoing peace effort,' he explained. 'Will they join? I hope they will.' Speaking later at a St Patrick's Day dinner hosted by the president, Mr Reynolds said that US support for the Northern Ireland peace process would have 'an important influence' on its outcome.' He said that the Downing Street declaration had created a 'historic opportunity' to resolve the Northern Ireland conflict and had 'removed any possible justification for violence'. He had earlier briefed Mr Clinton on the latest developments in the peace process and he was in turn briefed by Mr Clinton on the recent visit to the US by Mr John Major, the prime minister. In London, Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, was urged strongly by Tory backbenchers to increase pressure on the Irish government to improve security co-operation. Many Conservative backbenchers are anxious for security co-operation to be improved in areas such as intelligence gathering and the cross-border pursuit of terrorist suspects. These matters are understood to have been raised by officers of the Tory backbench Northern Ireland committee in a short meeting with the Northern Ireland secretary after question-time in the House of Commons. Earlier, Sir Patrick told MPs that the recent IRA mortar attacks at Heathrow Airport would not wreck the peace process. He said: 'If Sinn Fein or the Provisional IRA consider that they are going by violence to secure a departure from the declaration or any concession from the British government, they would be better employed taking a running jump at themselves.'</p>

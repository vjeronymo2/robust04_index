According to the deputy health minister, the first instance  of AIDS observed in Iran was in 1366 [year beginning 21 March  1987] in a one-year-old child. This resulted from imported  blood products, he said. He announced that all blood received  from donors by the Blood Transfusion Organization is being  examined meticulously and no blood is being imported. Imported  blood products are also being carefully tested, so there is no  likelihood in Iran of AIDS being transmitted through blood. The  number of AIDS victims that has been identified in Iran so far  is 270, and of those, 62 have died.</p>

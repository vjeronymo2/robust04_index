			<p>BFN     [Text] Quito, 9 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Joint police and Army  operations to locate two U.S. oil technicians who were abducted  in Ecuador's Amazon region have yielded no results yet, it was  reported here. Intense land and air searches were conducted over  a broad area of eastern Sucumbios Province, along the border  with Colombia.    U.S. Ambassador Peter Romero confirmed on Tuesday the  disappearance of his countrymen Eldon Lee Horton and Clyde Nolan  Killgore. The U.S. citizens, employees of the Intairdrill  drilling company, had been missing since last weekend when they  were seen in the oil town of Shushufindi.    Press reports in Quito indicated that as a result of the  investigations conducted in Sucumbios in the past few hours the  police had arrested several suspects, apparently Colombians and  Ecuadoreans.    According to sources close to the police, the oil  technicians  were presumably taken by their captors to the Colombian side of  the border, which would further hamper the rescue. Commander  Ruben Barahona told newsmen that different organized crime  groups operate in this conflict-ridden area of Ecuador's Amazon  region. Barahona added that in that area drug traffickers, among  their other activities, are responsible for the transfer of  precursor chemicals that are used in Colombia to process the  drug. "Criminal and drug activities have made the place very  dangerous," the official indicated.    Despite intense operations by the Armed Forces and the  police, whose collaboration was requested by the diplomatic  mission, authorities conceded today that they do not have any  concrete leads to find the missing persons.    At least five U.S. citizens, including two technicians of  U.S. oil companies in Sucumbios, were kidnapped in past years.  In most cases, the kidnappees were rescued, but no specifics  exist on the conditions or the ransom agreed upon for their  release.    Administration Secretary General Carlos Larreategui denied  that the recent wave of kidnappings registered in various  locations of the country is related to a subversive group.  Larreategui blamed the kidnappings on common crime and stressed  that the only armed group known in Ecuador, referring to the  "Red Sun," announced its demobilization and turned its weapons  in to military authorities.    However, presumed "Red Sun" militants who broke away from  those who negotiated the peace have told the media from hiding  that they will continue their activities and the armed struggle.</p>

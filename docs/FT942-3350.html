			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Arts: Olaf Bar - Recital Economic prosperity has always been an important precondition if the arts are to flourish. By the turn of the 18th century the middle classes in Dresden were sufficiently well-off to enjoy widespread domestic music-making and a large amount of their chamber music and songs has come down to us. The baritone Olaf Bar was born and lives in Dresden, so he is well placed to delve into the city's musical history. Naumann and Weber, Reissiger and Marschner were among the composers most active there, usually involved with the court opera. Bar included songs by each of them in his Wigmore Hall recital on Monday and gave a good idea of the sturdy Teutonic musical diet a Dresden family might have favoured after dinner around 1825. By and large there are good reasons why we do not hear many of these songs today. One poet after another sets out for the hills, roams across green meadows, listens to the hunting-horns and generally finds his words set to an unremarkable melody supported by four-square harmony. In short, these are generic pieces and Bar treated them in a generic way. His singing is admirable for its effortless balance of words and line, but a sharper imagination might have helped one or two come individually to life. The opening stanza of Reissiger's 'Das Schlachtfeld' talks of the moon shining with serenity, but no moon-lit shadows were cast by the performance, and helpful phrases later, like the fields 'in bloody dress' looking on in horror, were not used to add much colour. Much more interesting was the combination of songs by Robert and Clara Schumann, husband and wife, also Dresden-based, after the interval. Clara's music is getting more attention these days (some record labels specialise in women composers) and on the evidence of songs like 'Liebst du um Schonheit', as tender as Mahler's setting, she could rise to equal the best. Her music is not tied down by the bar-lines, like the lesser examples heard earlier. Bar found more to engage him in these and the Robert Schumann songs. Though the voice is short on expressive colours when he is singing quietly, he puts across outgoing songs, like 'Die beiden Grenadiere' (not just Robert Schumann, but also a Reissiger setting) with more communicative energy than he used to. Perhaps the ever-supportive Geoffrey Parsons as accompanist might challenge Bar to give more. Second recital, with half the same programme, today</p>

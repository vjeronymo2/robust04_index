			<p>SUMMARY                                 In an apparent effort to limit the amount of rice imported into  Japan and keep rice prices high, Japan's Ministry of Agriculture,  Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) seems to be taking steps to  restrict competition in the country's rice trade, including  limiting the number of companies that can trade in imported rice  and cracking down on growing imports of rice through the  international mail.  MAFF may try to use similar tactics to limit  rice imports after Japan formally opens its rice market in 1995.                            END SUMMARY     Recent Japanese press reports suggest that MAFF is attempting to  restrict both competition in the rice trade and the quantity of  rice that will be imported into Japan after the country opens its  rice market by allowing only a limited number of companies to  handle imported rice.  According to the 25 April Asahi Shimbun  and the 26 April editions of Nihon Keizai Shimbun and Yomiuri  Shimbun, MAFF's Food Agency rejected the applications of all of  the more than ten new companies that applied to handle imported  rice in Japanese fiscal year 1994.  This decision leaves the  importation of rice in the hands of 20 companies that have been  registered to handle emergency imports or restricted imports for  special purposes in the past, Asahi Shimbun and Nihon Keizai  Shimbun reported.     Judging from press reporting, MAFF may have deliberately excluded  the new companies by setting vague or arbitrary requirements for  handling rice imports that they could not meet.  The 26 April  Nihon Keizai Shimbun quoted Kyuzo Saito, the chief of the Food  Agency's Import Division, as saying that none of the firms met  the standards for "experience and credibility" set by the agency  for importers.  Among these standards, according to Nihon Keizai  Shimbun, are requirements that a company be capitalized at over  100 million yen and have an unspecified amount of "experience" in  the rice trade.  In addition,  Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported that  some firms claimed not even to have known that the Food Agency  was accepting applications for additional government-approved  rice importers.     MAFF may also try to limit rice imports and maintain high rice  prices by cracking down on the reportedly booming imports of rice  through the international postal service.  According to the 26  April Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japanese consumers have been  increasingly taking advantage of a loophole in Japan's food  control regulations that allows individuals to import up to 100  kilograms of rice a year through the mail.  The major attraction  of this arrangement, judging from various press reports, is that  rice purchased through such channels is significantly cheaper  than rice available on the domestic market.  According to the 26  April Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Chinese rice imported by mail through  one consumer cooperative cost 3,500 yen per 10 kilograms,  including postage and taxes.  By contrast, according to a 27  April Kyodo report, the average price of top-quality domestic  rice was 6,365 yen per 10 kilograms in February, while Chinese  and California rice imported through regular channels cost  between 4,100 and 4,300 yen per 10 kilograms in March.     Suggesting that MAFF may crack down on such ventures, the 26  April Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported that the ministry's Food  Agency has  described the increasing import of rice through the  mail as "problematic."  The paper speculated that questions might  be raised about the lack of health inspections on rice imported  through the postal system and about the possibility that such  rice might be contaminated by excessive pesticides or mold-  -arguments that MAFF has used to bar imports of other items, such  as U.S. apples, in the past.     Outlook     MAFF's efforts to restrict competition in the rice trade may help  to keep the price of imported rice on the Japanese market  relatively high, thus limiting its appeal to Japanese consumers  and keeping high-cost Japanese rice growers in business.  MAFF  may attempt to use similar tactics to limit imports starting in  1995, when Japan is scheduled to partially open its rice market  as part of an agreement reached in the recently-concluded Uruguay  Round of international trade talks.

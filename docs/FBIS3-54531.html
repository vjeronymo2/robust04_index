			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Chief Editor Hasan Sabra: "Al-Asad's Summit"] </F>   [Excerpts] [passage omitted] President al-Asad arrived in  Geneva backed by a cohesive domestic front, a comfortable  economy, a huge modern Army, a unified vision, and a decisive  spirit. Can Washington, the West, and those who inform and  carry out analyses for President Clinton possibly forget that  pan-Arab Syria, with its secular system, is the only country  without an Islamic fundamentalism problem, indeed, the only Arab  country that uses fundamentalist groups to strengthen its  position anywhere?    The West cannot forget that Syria has often come under  siege,  so critical in one case that the Syrian Treasury contained under  $50,000 in hard currency. Yet Syria never retreated; indeed, it  became more committed and more determined. [passage omitted]    What does al-Asad want and what did he achieve?    What does Clinton want and what did he achieve?    Al-Asad got an American presence in Geneva, a meeting with  an  Arab president, when the Americans are used to summoning Third  World leaders, including some Arabs.    Al-Asad had a chance for full, comprehensive, and methodic  talks with Clinton. He forced the President of the world's  biggest power to listen to him for five and a half hours.  Al-Asad did most of the talking. Usually, the Americans summon  presidents to convey brief messages within minutes. They then  look at their watches and allow photographers in to take  pictures--perhaps the most important outcome of meetings with  U.S. Presidents.    President al-Asad entrenched the Madrid formula for a  solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict based on the exchange of  land for peace and the implementation of Security Council  Resolutions 242 and 338. President al-Asad added Security  Council Resolution 425 concerning Lebanon and the American  President agreed. This resolution was not discussed in the past  so as to reassure Syria that Israel would not take advantage and  tempt some Lebanese into thinking that a separate deal with  Lebanon could be concluded on the basis of the resolution.    Al-Asad established that dialogue to achieve settlement is  not held directly with the Zionist enemy, but directly with  Washington as a sponsor (together with Russia) of the peace  conference. The conference was originally held on this basis.  It continues to be held on the same basis although Israel  affected the unified Arab position through the separate deal  with Yasir 'Arafat and its Gaza-Jericho offshoot.    Al-Asad returned the just and comprehensive peace to the  peace process headlines. The American President stated his  agreement publicly at the news conference after having stated it  in the meeting.    President al-Asad's success in reviving the idea of a  comprehensive peace seems the equivalent of the fall of the  Gaza-Jericho deal. This means al-Asad is again holding the  Palestinian card. What the Palestinians lost through  'Arafat--the dream of a state--can be achieved through al-Asad  within the framework of the comprehensive peace as an  alternative to 'Arafat's separate deal.    Al-Asad succeeded in turning the meeting with President  Bill Clinton into a chance to normalize relations with the  United States. This nullifies Israel's pronouncement--which  succeeded in the cases of al-Sadat and 'Arafat--that  normalization with Israel is the key to normalization with the  United States. Al-Asad appeared very successful in making  normalization with the United States the key to an Arab-Zionist  settlement and then to the establishment of successful relations  with the United States.    Successful bilateral relations with Washington allow Syria  to  play a major regional role affecting Lebanon, Jordan, Palestine,  and perhaps others, especially since Damascus has special  relations with Tehran and good ties with Egypt, Libya, Yemen,  and most Arab Gulf states. With this, the Golan is restored,  and Syria's forthcoming role grows bigger.    Israel sought normalization with Syria so that it could  infiltrate the Arab east, as it succeeded through the  Gaza-Jericho agreement with 'Arafat.    But by normalizing its relations with Washington, Damascus  can retain a full pan-Arab role that will certainly not be in  Israel's favor.    Al-Asad--and this is very important--succeeded in convincing  the U.S. Administration that Israel is the party that must say  whether it wants peace or not. Even more, he succeeded in  persuading Clinton to rearrange the settlement priorities to be  as follows: first, withdrawal; second, security; third, normal  relations.    Withdrawal is needed from Israel.    Security is needed from Israel and Syria.    Normal relations are needed from Syria.    Moreover, al-Asad managed to tell the Americans, and Clinton  agreed, that if peace is not achieved now, Israel will be held  responsible; Syria will bear no consequences, and no one can  then threaten it or accuse it of terrorism.    Al-Asad also managed to differentiate between Hizballah,  which the United States accuses of terrorism, and the resistance  to liberate the south from the Zionist occupation, although  Hizballah is the main tool of resistance there.    Concerning withdrawal, Clinton accepted al-Asad's condition.  Al-Asad threw the ball into the Zionist court and sowed the  seeds of a U.S.-Israeli dispute.    It must be said that al-Asad did not make the Golan issue  the  driving force behind his movement and demands so that he could  not be easily besieged and forced into concessions. Although he  said the Golan is in the heart of Syria, he never forgot that  Syria's role is much larger than a piece of land, no matter how  valuable.    Concerning security, President al-Asad returned the ball to  the American court. He said Damascus is threatened because it  is only a few kilometers away from the occupied land while the  Palestinian (Israeli) cities are hundreds of kilometers away  from the front. This presents America with an invitation to come  to the region at Syria's request, not against Syria's will.  This would ensure security for Syria and stop resistance  operations against occupation, which is supposed to end;  occupation is removed and resistance then stops.    As regards normal relations, peace is established through  the  desire of the Arab people at a time when such peace appears to  be the least of all evils, made at the hands of a leadership  that achieved the maximum level of hopes and dreams at this  stage, and at a time when the world appeared stunned at the  capabilities of this leader, who, in the darkest of times,  manages to get the best terms and those closest to Arab hopes in  an age of retreats.    No one should forget that what President al-Asad achieved at  this stage is the same thing offered to us when Arab solidarity  was at its peak, when Egypt was the leader of the Arab world,  when Arab oil and money were available and undepleted, when the  Soviet Union existed with its military, economic, and political  support and international influence, when Iraq was healthy  before two destructive wars, when Israel did not have nuclear  weapons, when Zionist superiority was clear but not decisive,  when Lebanon was not destroyed, and when Palestinian resistance  was active.

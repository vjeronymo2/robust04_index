			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / FT Exporter (8): The pace of investment quickens - Britain in China / For all the voices of doom about the effects of the Hong Kong row, China's huge infrastructure demands are likely to create big opportunities for UK companies. There are already 600 British-invested joint ventures in China Sir Michael Palliser, president of the China-Britain Trade Group, is optimistic about prospects for British trade and investment in China in spite of lingering problems over Hong Kong. Senior Chinese officials had indicated, he said, a wish to separate politics from business in this testing phase leading up to China's resumption of sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997. Judging by the latest figures which reveal buoyant two-way trade and strong British investment growth, the vexed Hong Kong issue has not as yet made a big impact on Sino-British business, but UK companies remain wary about possible fallout. Sir Michael, who led a high-level British trade delegation to China in mid-September, said Chinese officials including vice premier Li Lanqing, had gone out of their way to stress the importance of the business relationship, and this augured well for Sino-British trade. 'Whatever the political difficulties it is important to continue to do business with China which is developing at a formidable rate. Of course, it would be desirable if political relations between the two countries were easier but in terms of doing business we don't see great problems,' Sir Michael told reporters in Beijing. In the first six months of this year, Britain's exports to China grew by 17.3 per cent to Pounds 420.2m compared with the corresponding period last year, while imports rose by 37.9 per cent to Pounds 781.9m (Dollars 1,211m), (see the table of statistics on this page). Among European Community countries Britain ranks fourth in exports to China behind Germany, France and Italy. But in investment, UK companies lead the pack, according to figures supplied by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation (Moftec). These show that, cumulatively, British-pledged (as opposed to actual utilised) investment in China between 1979-1993 reached Dollars 3bn, more than double that of Germany, its nearest competitor. In utilised investment, however, it ranked just behind France. Britain's actual investment in China had reached Dollars 578m by the end of 1993 compared with Dollars 602m for France. Britain's pledged investment of Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.9bn) placed it in sixth place on the table of top ten investors in China behind Hong Kong, Taiwan, the US, Japan and Singapore. British trade officials in Beijing say the official figures almost certainly under-state Britain's involvement since a portion of Hong Kong's investment on the mainland is of UK origin. At this sensitive moment in Sino-UK relations, many British companies wish to remain in the background. But there is no doubt that as far as investment is concerned, the pace is quickening. Figures show that last year alone, Dollars 1.99bn of UK investment was pledged, more than twice the figure for the previous decade. This squares with anecdotal impressions indicating that the scale of British investment is increasing with greater emphasis these days on larger projects as companies such as Pilkington and ICI become more confident about the Chinese business environment. China's huge infrastructure demands will almost certainly create big opportunities for British companies such as GEC which is negotiating equity involvement in a power plant in Zhejiang province south of Shanghai, under a build-operate-transfer (BOT) scheme. For all the voices of doom about the effects of the Hong Kong row, Britain's business presence on the ground is fairly impressive. Among 600 British-invested joint ventures are some of the UK's most prominent companies, including BP and Shell, Rolls Royce, Glaxo and SmithKline Beecham, Zeneca, Coats Viyella, Allied Lyons, Cadbury Schweppes and BTR, to name just a few. Service organisations such as banks, securities houses, insurance companies, advertising agencies, legal and accountants firms are also proving to be extremely active. Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation and Standard Chartered are extending their reach; National Westminster recently established a presence in Shanghai; Jardine Fleming and Barings are among the more prominent foreign brokers; Saatchi and Saatchi has several offices in China; Sedgwicks was recently granted a broking licence; and Coopers &amp; Lybrand has ambitious plans for a network of partnerships with local accounting firms. Indeed, it is the services sector that may well provide the greatest scope for increased British involvement. With China's huge appetite for capital, it would be surprising if the Chinese did not turn increasingly to the London Stock Exchange and City of London institutions for financial assistance and advice. But industry is also laying what appears to be a solid foundation for expansion. BP, for example, concluded an agreement in May this year for a 51 per cent stake in a UDollars 100m acetic acid plant in Chongqing, Sichuan province; Coats Viyella has invested some UDollars 100m in a web of mills, mostly concentrated near Tianjin, east of Beijing; Unilever, through its Walls ice-cream group has outlayed UDollars 50m to establish a factory and distribution network in Beijing; BTR is investing about UDollars 90 in a bottling plant near Guangzhou in southern China; Pilkington which was involved in the establishment of a float glass project in Shanghai in 1983, is engaged in three other projects. Companies such as Rolls Royce, which have been exporting to China for many years, are also doing well. The UK company recently won a big order to supply 42 of its RB211-535 jet engines for Boeing 757's bought by Chinese airlines. Rolls Royce says it is confident of winning further orders. But as the China market continues to open, so does competition become more intense, with the Americans staking a claim for a bigger share. The recent high profile visit to Beijing of Mr Ron Brown, the US Commerce Secretary, at the head of a delegation of 24 chief executive officers of leading American companies is just one indication of an intensifying US focus on China. As Sir Michael Palliser of the CBTG says: 'Our main worry is not competition from other Europeans, but from the thundering herd of Americans coming in.' On a general economic front, China is redoubling its efforts to contain inflation with a new campaign to curb rises in the prices of grain, cotton and chemical fertiliser. New figures from China's State Statistical Bureau show that consumer prices in 35 main cities rose 27.1 per cent during the year to August, compared with 24.2 during the year to July. The July-to-August inflationary surge prompted an announcement by a worried leadership that fighting inflation would be the government's main priority for the rest of this year.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                   CHINESE AND ASIAN TRADE WITH EUROPE  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                            Values in Pounds m  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                             1992    1993     1994     1993   % change  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- UK-CHINA TRADE Exports                      430     739    420.2    358.1     +17.3 Imports                      954   1,327    781.9    566.8     +37.9  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- UK-TAIWAN TRADE Exports                      545     668    364.1      322     +13.1 Imports                    1,394   1,617    817.6    753.4      +8.5  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- UK-HONG KONG TRADE Exports                    1,613   2,170   1047.1    958.5      +9.2 Imports                    2,397   2,998  1,393.6  1,319.6      +5.6  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- UK-KOREA TRADE Exports                      654     796    472.2    405.9     +16.3 Imports                      934   1,078    515.0    498.6      +3.3  -----------------------------------------------------------------------   COMPARATIVE PERFORMANCE: PERCENTAGE SHARE OF OECD EXPORTS TO CHINA  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Country                     1989    1990     1991     1992      1993 Germany                     10.1    11.3      9.5     11.1      12.8 France                       6.9     6.6      5.3      4.3       3.6 Italy                        5.4     4.0      5.1      4.5       5.8 UK                           2.8     3.9      2.2      2.3       2.5  -----------------------------------------------------------------------       COMPARATIVE PERFORMANCE: SHARE OF OECD EXPORTS TO HONG KONG  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Country                     1989    1990     1991     1992      1993  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Germany                      6.1     6.0      5.6      5.9       5.8 France                       3.7     3.6      3.3      3.4       3.8 Italy                        4.6     4.9      4.3      4.5       4.7 UK                           6.2     6.8      6.5      6.1       6.2  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                    EXPORTS IN 1993: VALUES IN USDollars m  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                     CHINA    TAIWAN    HONG KONG     KOREA  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- OECD               45,102      na      51,680     49,900 Germany             5.795     3,515       3,010      3,448 France              1,599     1,105       1,986      1,202 Italy               2,824     1,205       3,433      1,763 UK                  1,111     1,002       3,196      1,195  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- In the first six months of this year, Britain's exports to China grew by 17.3 per cent to Pounds 420.2m compared with the corresponding period last year, while imports rose by 37.9 per cent to Pounds 781.9m.

			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / John Major's Year: Red tape makes it harder to scratch a living - Small-businessman John Millington says the other JM should pay more attention to domestic problems IF IT has been a tough year for Mr John Major, it has hardly been one long party for Mr John Millington. He has been working up to 14 hours a day, seven days a week, to keep his one-man business alive, and seems, possibly like the prime minister, a little surprised to have survived. Mr Millington, an engraver by profession and Liverpudlian by birth, owns Adams Engraving in Woking. He bought it 18 months ago as the economy slid deeper into recession. He had applied for the job of manager but put his house on the line to buy the business: 'Everyone thought I was crazy,' he recalls. The company, which specialises in engraving everything from golf club trophies to aero-engine components, had a small base of regular customers and turnover of Pounds 35,000 a year. Now, in spite of weak demand, a long period of high interest rates and rising raw material prices, Mr Millington has pushed turnover to about Pounds 68,000. It should reach Pounds 80,000 this year and the plan is start recruiting by Christmas. But Mr Major has not made life any easier for the small enterprises they claim to champion, says Mr Millington. Britain's departure from the exchange rate mechanism meant a sharp rise in the cost of German-made brass and he has been unable to pass on the increase to customers. He also paints a familiar picture of bureaucratic interference and commercial ignorance among officials. 'They constantly claim they are banishing red tape but I have yet to see any evidence. People are urged to take up their redundancy pay and have a go for themselves, but the environment for small businesses is still hostile. The VAT people can be vicious and now we are awaiting our first visit from the Inland Revenue. Now I have to implement a quality standard which is going to cost me thousands and take two years. Where is the understanding?' He says Mr Major's greatest strength is his negotiating ability, as demonstrated in Europe, but he wants him to pay more attention to the nation's domestic problems. 'We need stronger leadership. People need encouragement and the confidence to go out and set up the small engineering shops which will help restore the manufacturing skills we have been losing. The priority must be for big capital projects which will work through to the benefit of everyone down the chain.' This holiday weekend, Mr Millington and his wife, Barbara, who keeps the books, will take a well-earned break from the daily struggle. He regularly asks himself if it is worth the effort: 'I suppose being your own boss still means the answer is yes.'</p>

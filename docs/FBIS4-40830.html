			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Mikhail Lantsman report in the "Lobby" column: "Duma </F> Deputies Rise to the Defense of the Golan Heights. Near East Is  Warned About U.S. Aggression"]    [Text] A group of State Duma deputies has warned of a  dangerous course of events in the Near East threatening Russia's  national interests. In a message to lower chamber speaker Ivan  Rybkin and Russian Federation Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev  the deputies analyzed the "true reasons" which prompted U.S.  President Clinton's administration to force Israel to retreat  from the Golan Heights captured in 1967.    The conclusions the deputies came to are worrying to Russia,  Syria, and Israel. The strategic goal of a peaceful settlement  according to the U.S. prescription, Duma deputies believe, is to  turn the Golan Heights into a military base for the deployment  of rapid reaction forces. As a result of this Israel will  become totally dependent on the United States; Syria and other  Arab countries, such as Egypt, will be included in the sphere of  American policy while Russia, together with its great-power  status, will lose lucrative arm markets. In order to avert the  treacherous U.S. plans, the deputies asked the Russian Foreign  Ministry to step up its influence on the process of peace  settlement. The deputies believe that U.S. and Russian armed  forces should be excluded from a possible UN peacekeeping  contingent in the Golan Heights in the event that Israeli-Syrian  accords are reached.    The group of defenders of the Golan Heights against U.S.  expansion includes 33 deputies who signed the message. The  signatories include Sergey Baburin, Viktor Ilyukhin, Yuriy  Vlasov, Vasiliy Lipitskiy, and members of the communist faction  and Zhirinovskiy's Liberal Democrats. The drive is spearheaded  by National Republican Party leader Nikolay Lysenko.    On 17 June the State Duma rejected Lysenko's proposal to  include the Golan Heights issue on the agenda. Nonetheless the  results of the voting (more than 80 in favor) showed that the  number of Russian defenders of the Golan Heights has grown.</p>

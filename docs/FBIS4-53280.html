			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 17 KYODO -- Tokyo will seek to find  common ground with the United States, especially on the overall  goal of the trade "framework" talks, during subcabinet-level  negotiations to be held in Washington from Thursday, a senior  Japanese Trade Ministry official said Tuesday.    Clarification of Japan's stance on the issue is one of three  conditions presented by the U.S. in April for getting the  stalled talks moving again. The other two are a pledge on  macroeconomic policy measures and "objective criteria."    Washington has requested that Japan promise an increase in  American access to Japan's markets on a sectoral basis, said the  official at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry  (MITI), who declined to be named.    The original framework accord signed after the July 1993  summit between then Japanese Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and  U.S. President Bill Clinton stated that the two countries would  strive to enhance Japan's imports from the U.S. on an "overall  basis."    Japan will carry an answer to the U.S. request for a  statement on the overall goals of the framework talks during the  coming Washington meeting, the MITI official said.</p>

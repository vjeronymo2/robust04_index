Deputy Home Minister Megat Junid Megat Ayob said the  directive was issued by Prime Minister Dr Mahathir Mohamed, who  is also Home Minister, at a meeting with officials of the  ministry, immigration department and police Thursday.    The freeze is also to enable the government to assess the  total levy that can be collected from foreign workers, he said  to reporters after closing a national seminar on education for  parent-teacher associations here.    However, he said, the employment of professionals could  still  be considered as there was a shortage in the country.    He said there were now an estimated 200,000 illegal  immigrants either working without work permits or roaming in the  country without valid travel documents.    In addition, there were foreigners being held at temporary  immigration detention centres for working without valid permits.    He said the police and immigration department would soon  step  up operations to detect illegal immigrants in estates,  construction sites and factories.    Those caught without any travel documents will be deported  as  soon as possible, he said.</p>

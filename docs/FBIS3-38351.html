The job of running the "club" of 24 industrialised nations  falls vacant in September when Mr Jean-Claude Paye, the present  secretary-general, completes his second five-year term of  office. Mr Paye, a former French diplomat, is again a candidate  for the job, as is Mr Donald Johnston, a Canadian Liberal  politician.    British Government officials said yesterday that Lord Lawson  was ideally qualified, pointing out that he was a strong  supporter of international economic co-operation when  chancellor.

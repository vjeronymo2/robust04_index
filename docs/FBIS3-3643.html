			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tianjin, March 17 (XINHUA) -- Northern China's  Tianjin city will develop its subterranean heat resources to  meet the increasing demand for energy.    This was announced by an official from the Tianjin municipal  government at a recent conference.    The city, rich in geothermal energy sources, has reserves of  underground hot water estimated at 7.876 billion cubic meters.    Baodi County, north of Tianjin city, has the biggest  reserves  of the city's subterranean hot water, which cover a total area  of 8,700 sq km. Ten of these heat fields, extending to 3,074  square kilometers, are especially rich in underground heat  resources.    The underground hot water, with temperatures between 25 and  150 degrees centigrade, is widely used in the city's timber  manufacturing, home heating, domestic hot water supplies,  greenhouses, warm water swimming pools, and scientific  experiments.    The Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources has so far  invested tens of millions of yuan in exploration of the city's  underground heat resources. The United Nations Development  Program has also invested five million U.S. dollars in the  exploration.    The city has by now tapped more than 250 underground hot  water reservoirs. The deepest involved drilling to a depth of  3,654 meters and the hottest is 98 degrees centigrade.    The city uses about 38 million cubic meters of underground  hot water annually, with thermal energy equal to that produced  by 2.5 million tons of coal.    Tianjin is one of the biggest underground heat energy  centres  in China. More than 140 overseas experts have visited the city  to exchange views on the exploration of underground heat  resources.    Business people from the United States, Iceland, France,  Italy, New Zealand and Japan have expressed interest in  investing in the development of the city's subterranean heat  resources.    A Tianjin-Hong Kong venture was set up earlier this year to  exploit this resource.    So far more than 80 countries and regions have explored and  made use of their own underground heat energy resources.</p>

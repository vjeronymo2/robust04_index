			<p>910422 FT  22 APR 91 / London still in grip of recession, says chamber ECONOMIC activity in London continues to suffer from the recession, according to a survey published today by the London Chamber of Commerce. The survey suggests that companies are still shelving investment plans and shedding jobs at an accelerating rate, with output in manufacturing and service sectors continuing to fall. The gap in performance between the two sectors has narrowed, according to the chamber. Tough trading conditions have left once-buoyant service companies as vulnerable as those in manufacturing. The survey covers the first three months of 1991 and involves 268 businesses employing 250,000 people. It shows that the proportion of companies working at full capacity has halved in the past year, with fewer than 20 per cent saying they were operating at full strength. Exports by service-sector companies continued to decline in the first quarter. Nearly half of respondents reported reduced overseas business. The same proportion said they were cutting employment levels, and the chamber says it expects redundancies to continue, although at a reduced rate as the economic downturn levels off. The squeeze on profits means that businesses are still making sharp cuts in investment plans. Some 44 per cent of those involved in the survey said revised plans meant they would not invest in new plant and machinery over the next year. Only 13 per cent said they intended to raise investment during the same period. The chamber says that, although it does not expect any further deterioration in short-term domestic conditions, business confidence in the longer term remains subdued. Further cuts in interest rates are needed, it stresses, to boost demand and help alleviate cash-flow problems.</p>

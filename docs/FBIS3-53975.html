			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Tawfiq 'Abid] </F>   [Text] In activation of the economic agreement they signed  on 7 January, the Jordanian and Palestinian sides have signed  another agreement to reinforce and bolster ties of cooperation  and coordination in the fields of security, territories, and  borders.    This accord, which was signed at the Jordanian Foreign  Ministry two days ago, acquires great importance, especially  since it touches on one of the most sensitive issues within the  framework of relations between countries; that is, the issue of  security.    The Jordanian and Palestinian sides focused their concern on  bolstering cooperation and coordination to serve the  distinguished relations between the Jordanians and Palestinians  at this historical stage in order to achieve the utmost level of  security and stability for the two peoples.    AL-DUSTUR publishes the six points contained in the  Jordanian-Palestinian agreement on cooperation and  coordination--which the committee on security, territories, and  borders that stems from the Higher Jordanian-Palestinian Joint  Committee reached after two days of continuous meetings. These  points form the basis for joint coordination between the two  sides. They are:    1. The two sides will exchange information and coordinate on  the peace negotiations in order to reinforce and unify their  negotiating stands on the bilateral and multilateral tracks.    2. The Jordanians will continue to assist the Palestinians  to prepare and train cadres and members of the security forces  in various specializations.    3. The two sides will cooperate and exchange information in  all fields related to the work of the committee in order to  serve their interests for the higher national interest.    4. The two sides will form two subcommittees: one for  security and borders and the other for territories. They will  also form any other committee necessary for coordination.    5. The two sides will define the appropriate mechanism for  coordination between them in all fields and provide suitable  means to achieve this at every stage.    6. The two sides will continue efforts to reinforce  bilateral bonds of trust, brotherhood, and distinctive ties to  serve their joint interests.</p>

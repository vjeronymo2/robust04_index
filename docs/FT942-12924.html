			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / International Company News: Northern Telecom posts Dollars 88m Northern Telecom, the Canadian telecommunications equipment supplier, expects to see year-on-year profit gains in 1994 and a return to more traditional profit levels in 1995, said Mr Jean Monty, president and chief executive, Reuter reports from Toronto. The group, 52 per cent-owned by BCE of Canada, posted a net profit of USDollars 88m, or 35 cents a share, in the first quarter, after a Dollars 72m, or 29 cents a share, gain on the sale of its Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, fibre-optic plant. This compares with Dollars 76m, or 30 cents a share, in the first quarter of 1993. Mr Monty had previously warned that Northern would suffer an operating loss in the first quarter, but the company produced an operating profit of Dollars 52m against operating earnings of Dollars 165m in the year-ago period. 'We are pleased with first-quarter operating performance, as we had previously anticipated an operating loss. 'Higher revenue growth towards the end of the quarter in certain product and geographical markets combined with higher-than-anticipated margins contributed to the positive results,' Mr Monty said. 'We are also encouraged with our progress on the restructuring activities To date, we have accomplished or announced reductions in line with our targeted cost improvement programme.' He said more than USDollars 1bn in cash proceeds from asset sales would improve Northern's financial flexibility, but added that there was still a lot of work to do. Recent international contracts, particularly in Colombia and China, provided a positive reinforcement for Northern's long-term prospects.</p>

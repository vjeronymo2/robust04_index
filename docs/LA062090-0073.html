			<p><P> June 20, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PASSAGE OF NEA BILL IS RATED 'LESS THAN 50-50';  </P> <P> ARTS: MEANWHILE, ANOTHER ORGANIZATION, THE OREGON SHAKESPEARE FESTIVAL, REJECTS  A $49,500 NEA GRANT.  </P> <P> A divided House committee, underscoring deep, unresolved disagreements in  Congress over the National Endowment for the Arts, voted Tuesday to send a bill  -- renewing the agency without restrictions for another five years -- to the  full House for a mid-July confrontation over public financing of the arts.  </P> <P> Under the terms of an unusual bipartisan agreement, the bill was voted out of  the House Education and Labor Committee without amendment and with practically  no debate. The action indicates that the controversy over the endowment's  future remains so intense that no attempt at bipartisan consensus was possible.  Indeed, at the Tuesday session chaired by Rep. Augustus Hawkins (D-Los  Angeles), both Republicans and Democrats deserted the positions of their  respective subcommittee leaders.  </P> <P> In a dour post-mortem on the committee vote, the chairman of the subcommittee  that had initial responsibility for the NEA bill told reporters that chances  are "less than 50-50" the arts endowment can emerge from the political crisis  without restrictions being clamped on the kinds and specific subject matter of  artwork it can support.  </P> <P> "The NEA will never be the same, regardless of what happens with this bill,"  said Rep. Pat Williams (D-Mont.). "To be perfectly frank, we need to develop  the best possible strategy for the floor if the NEA is to survive."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, a prominent theater organization in NEA Chairman John Frohnmayer's  home state of Oregon has become the latest group to refuse an NEA grant in  protest of a 1990 endowment requirement that grant recipients pledge not to  produce obscene work.  </P> <P> The Oregon Shakespeare Festival, the oldest regional theater organization in  the country, said Tuesday it had rejected a $49,500 NEA grant. The festival,  which has a total budget of about $10 million, said its decision was influenced  by the move to reject $72,000 in NEA funding announced last week by Los Angeles  choreographer Bella Lewitzky. More than a half dozen artists or arts groups  have now turned down NEA support in the obscenity dispute.  </P> <P> A spokesman for the festival in Ashland, Ore., said its board voted unanimously  to reject the money even though the decision might worsen the political dilemma  of Frohnmayer, a former Oregon lawyer. "We certainly see it as a beleaguered  organization," said a festival spokeswoman, "but loyalty to John could not take  precedence over what is really a moral issue."  </P> <P> The House action here followed a morning meeting between House Speaker Thomas  S. Foley (D-Mass.) and the two leaders of the House NEA bill, Williams and Rep.  Tom Coleman (R-Mo.). At the meeting, Foley -- who had previously given signals  that he wanted at least some of the major disputes over the NEA resolved at the  committee level -- agreed to allow the bill to come to the floor essentially  unchanged from the version originally proposed by President Bush earlier this  year. Under the agreement, the House will take up the NEA's fate during either  the week of July 15 or July 22.  </P> <P> The Senate Education and Labor Committee has set next Wednesday for its  consideration of the NEA bill.  </P> <P> The agreement on the House strategy was described by Rep. Fred Grandy (R-Iowa),  a former actor, as "the last cease-fire on this issue" before what is expected  to be a bruising, highly charged floor debate in the House and, slightly later,  in the Senate. "You cannot have art without risk," Grandy declared. "If you  can, it's not worth it."  </P> <P> The bill sent to the floor was first drafted as the Bush Administration's  proposal for NEA extension, although the Administration has since signaled that  it would accept some restrictions on the content of NEA-funded art and would  settle for a one- or three-year extension of the NEA's life, instead of the  five years originally proposed.  </P> <P> The bill faces at least two major attempts at complete substitute language --  including one led by Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Lomita), who has vowed to alter  the legislation so it abolishes the NEA entirely, and another by Coleman and  Rep. Steve Gunderson (R-Wis.), who propose to carve up the arts endowment so  the amount of money it funnels directly to state arts councils is tripled, to  60%. The Coleman-Gunderson plan would also write into the NEA law the same  obscenity-restriction language incorporated in a 1974 Supreme Court ruling that  stands as the operative case law on the subject across the country.  </P> <P> Both Coleman and Williams acknowledged that they are negotiating over the final  language of the bill. The situation appeared to indicate that the most  permissive legislation arts supporters can hope to see emerge from Congress  would increase NEA money channeled directly to the states and include some form  of specific regulatory language governing art content.  </P> <P> "We recognize that, because of the circumstances, this agency is at political  risk," said Coleman of the 14-month controversy over the NEA that began last  year with a dispute over NEA support of an exhibit that included a photograph  of a crucifix immersed in urine. Asked how serious the political tremor set off  by the NEA has become, Williams said, "on a scale of 1-to-10, it's a 7."  </P> <P> MUSEUM MOTIONS DENIED  </P> <P> A judge has denied motions to dismiss obscenity charges against the Cincinnati  Contemporary Arts Center.

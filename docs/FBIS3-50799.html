During a news conference following a visit to Mexico, President  Cristiani said: "Of course we discussed the Chiapas problems.  President Salinas said it is a very delicate matter and that he  is trying to solve it as quickly as possible without inflicting  any suffering on the population."    Salinas met with Cristiani and Honduran President Rafael  Callejas in Mexico City and told them about the ongoing events  in southern Mexico that began with an uprising led by the  Zapatista National Liberation Army (EZLN). Regarding reports by  Mexican officials about the alleged presence of Salvadoran  guerrillas fighting alongside the EZLN, Cristiani said the issue  was not discussed during his meeting with Salinas.    Cristiani did say that the consequences of the North  American  Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) for Central America was among the  main issues discussed during the meeting. The agreement signed  by Mexico, the United States, and Canada went into effect on 1  January. According to Cristiani, "Mexico is willing to continue  negotiations for a free trade agreement with Central America.  It would be a disadvantage for our products not to have access  to the Mexican market."</p>

			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WILLIAM LYON IS STILL BULLISH ON HOME BUILDING  </P> <P> Home buyers are scarce as desert rain clouds, builders' financing sources are  going the way of the passenger pigeon, and William Lyon Co. is planning for the  future as zestfully as if it were entering the booming 1960s.  </P> <P> Crazy?  </P> <P> Well, a hallmark of Lyon's nearly 40 years in the residential construction  business is that he's mostly been right.  </P> <P> And Newport Beach-based Lyon, the nation's leading home builder last year in  sales volume, seems to think this is a great time for a builder who is willing  to stretch. Lyon is stretching into new fields -- financing and land  development.  </P> <P> Company officials maintain that there is no significant change going on, but  industry consultants and fellow developers say Lyon is paving a path that large  residential firms must follow to survive in an increasingly cash-starved  market.  </P> <P> For Lyon, whose formula for success includes "constantly adjusting business  plans to fit changing conditions," the current climate calls for a reduction in  his own residential construction while quietly shifting focus to finance other  builders and become increasingly active as a land developer and master planner.  </P> <P> "They are very intelligently capitalizing on their abilities," said real estate  consultant Alfred Gobar. "They have huge amounts of capital and an excellent  management, and when you have that, the best risk-reward ratio in residential  development isn't in building homes, it is in assembling raw land, getting the  entitlements and selling lots to other builders."  </P> <P> That is true even in a recession -- some would say especially in a recession.  And while he won't use the "R" word, Lyon acknowledges that his industry is in  the dumps right now.  </P> <P> "There is no question but that there is a slow-up in housing sales," Lyon said  in a recent interview. "Some of that is public resistance to prices."  </P> <P> The other cause, he said, is that people who have a home they must sell in  order to move up don't want to lower their own asking price.  </P> <P> The building industry also has been hit hard by the collapse of the savings and  loan industry, new government regulations on banks' real estate lending and the  withdrawal of large Japanese banking and development firms from the U.S. real  estate market. Lyon estimates that "75% of the home building capital in this  country has gone away, and it won't come back for a long period of time."  </P> <P> But to Lyon that grim landscape is littered with opportunity, not land mines.  Lyon's company is big enough and wealthy enough to weather the industry cycles  that regularly break smaller development firms.  </P> <P> So in the midst of a severe housing recession, Lyon is involved in nearly two  dozen developments on 10,000 acres of land, nearly half of it in Southern  California.  </P> <P> Lyon has been among the industry's leaders for decades. He was one of the first  home builders, for instance, to recognize that Orange County would be a major  growth area. From the beginning, he stuck with entry-level homes and apartments  and made money.  </P> <P> Lots of money. Forbes magazine estimates Lyon's wealth at $350 million. Lyon's  businesses are privately owned -- top executives collectively own a small  share, and Lyon and members of his immediate family own the rest. A retired Air  Force major general, who prefers to be called Gen. Lyon, he lives in a  22,000-square-foot mansion on 130 acres in Coto de Caza.  </P> <P> Lyon, a fighter pilot in World War II and the Korean War, became a home builder  in 1954 when he formed Luxury Homes in Fullerton with his brother, Leon. In  1968, Lyon sold the company to American Standard, the giant plumbing fixtures  firm, in a deal that enabled him to remain in control of a subsidiary called  Wm. Lyon Development. In 1972, upset with the direction American Standard was  taking, he resigned and started William Lyon Co.  </P> <P> A lot of his early financing came from ill-fated Continental Illinois Bank, but  in 1979 -- as the bank was beginning to show signs of faltering -- he wrenched  its Florida-based real estate development arm from it in an unfriendly tender  offer. That acquisition gave Lyon several thousand acres of prime land in  Southern Florida.  </P> <P> Lyon's next expansion move, in 1985, was to acquire 50% interest in Senior  Corp., a Florida-based real estate investment and development firm formed in  1980 by creditors of Continental Mortgage Investors, a bankrupt real estate  investment trust.  </P> <P> Lyon bought out his partner in the $141-million Senior Corp. purchase last year  and currently is completing the last two Senior Corp. projects -- a 900-acre  commercial and residential project in Atlanta and a 3,000-acre residential  community near Denver.  </P> <P> The developer, always looking for deals that would give him land to build on,  next acquired Pacific Lighting Corp.'s far-flung real estate enterprises in a  $325-million cash deal in 1987.  </P> <P> The Lyon corporate culture is a lean one in which executives and managers are  paid well but required to be out in the field, not holed up in the office. It  is a reflection of Lyon's credo: "If you want high pay," he has said, "you have  to be where the risk is, on the playing field, not in the stands keeping  score."  </P> <P> Lyon has not stuck to one field. Beside home building, he has been involved in  the aviation industry. From 1981 through 1986, he was co-owner with fellow  Orange County developer George Argyros of AirCal. They turned the troubled  airline around and sold it to American Airlines -- each pocketing a $15-million  profit. He recently formed Air/Lyon, a holding company for aviation service  operations.  </P> <P> An intensely private man, Lyon comes across as uncomfortable with people he  doesn't know well. He also is powerful enough to stop most others from talking  about him for the record. In interview after interview, people asked not to be  quoted lest they anger Lyon.  </P> <P> One Lyon employee said meetings with him can be painful, with awkward silences  and stilted conversation. But when Lyon talks about building, a lot of people  listen.  </P> <P> He says that his companies will continue building homes, and that they will  continue building the kind of homes they always have -- homes that don't come  equipped with all the bells and whistles some of his competitors provide, but  that usually have price tags among the lowest in a given market.  </P> <P> "The market is with people at the lower end of the price range," Lyon said.  </P> <P> Lyon's new developments are being done by a new entity, Lyon Communities. And  while that company was formed as part of the 67-year-old builder's estate  planning strategy, its name also is a signal of the direction in which Lyon is  heading.  </P> <P> Rather than simply buying into large land developers' projects and building and  selling tracts of homes, as a conventional merchant builder does, Lyon  Communities is a large land developer.  </P> <P> Its projects include Mountain Gate, a 1,000-acre master-planned community near  Corona; a proposed 550-acre community in Walnut, the 1,000-home Gordon Ranch  planned community near San Bernardino and four major communities in south  Florida.  </P> <P> In most of its projects, Lyon Communities will build some of the homes but will  sell many of the lots to other developers.  </P> <P> The company also will be a major land developer and a financial investor in  other builders' projects -- and the new development work no longer will be done  by the William Lyon Co.  </P> <P> That firm has become the holding company for assets that include Lyon-built  apartments and the commercial and industrial properties Lyon is jointly  developing with partners like Hughes Investment Co. and Koll Co.  </P> <P> Through its investment division, which manages a $1.5-billion portfolio, the  William Lyon Co. also has become a big player in residential development  financing, providing the cash for projects in Orange, Ventura and San Diego  counties by builders like Warmington Homes, Aikens Development Co. and Lusk Co.  </P> <P> As for Lyon, he is convinced that the California housing market is going to  rebound. "We'll continue building a tremendous amount of homes, but now we are  selling property to other builders too."  </P> <P> He predicts another run-up in prices because the supply of housing is  artificially constricted by government policies at the same time that  population growth continues in the state.  </P> <P> "In business, as in religion, you have to believe in something," he said in a  recent speech to developers. "If you are a California builder, you must believe  that people will continue to come to California, or you will not get to  heaven."  </P></p>

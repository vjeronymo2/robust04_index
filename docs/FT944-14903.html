			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt modifies its sector strategy The dollar, the main depressant for bourses this week, traded below DM1.50 again, early in New York. The mood on the Continent was not improved by ambiguities perceived in the US August trade figures, and their effect on bond markets, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT rotated its sector strategy by half a notch, and engineers took more punishment as the Dax index, 33.60 lower at 2,051.16 on the session, ended 11.45 down at an Ibis-indicated 2,058.13 after steadying in the post-bourse. MAN, which builds trucks as part of its range, dropped DM9 to DM405; Mannesmann, which brings in steel and mobile telephone prospects, fell another DM11 to DM378; and Linde, a leader in lift trucks, shed DM20 to DM858. All three, reflecting the switch to cyclicals, had been above-average performers as blue chips fell by 11.2 per cent in the first nine months of this year. But brokers said that the lower dollar would affect export margins, and that there was a large sell order in Mannesmann. Turnover rose from DM6.3bn to DM6.6bn. Among second-liners the window frame manufacturer Weru plummeted by DM225 or nearly 20 per cent to DM905: Bank Julius Bar and Barclays de Zoete Wedd cut their earnings forecasts after Weru scaled down its sales growth expectations and said that 1994 profits would not match those of the previous year. PARIS fell back during the afternoon under pressure from futures, and the CAC-40 index, having seen a high of 1,901, ended off 22.29 or 1.2 per cent at 1,876.31. There was plenty of corporate news to interest investors. Bouygues, the construction group, lost a further 3 per cent to FFr532 following a 4 per cent fall on Tuesday, after making a forecast of virtually unchanged 1994 sales figures and announcing an 18 per cent rise in first-half net profits. The company also suffered from selling after it said that it would not sign a pledge by members of the country's building industry against using illegal payments to win contracts or orders. A spokesperson for Bouygues said that it had not signed the ethics declaration since there were already laws governing business practice. Elf Aquitaine dipped FFr9 to FFr367 amid reports that it would make a loss on the sale of its US fertilisers division. Thomson-CSF shed FFr4.40 to FFr144.00 after detailing a fall in first-half net profits to FFr31m, from FFr455m last year. Analysts said the figures were in line with expectations. ZURICH was depressed by the weak dollar and losses in UBS and Roche certificates, the SMI index declining 12.7 to 2,529.8 in what was also seen as a continuing consolidation after last week's rally. Roche certificates fell SFr30 to SFr5,650, extending the week's losses, which followed downgraded earnings forecasts from a number of analysts after Monday's nine-month sales figures. However, James Capel, which did not alter its forecasts, commented that while sales growth was slowing, Roche had plenty of scope to reduce costs, most notably in pharma research and development, and this was increasingly being emphasised as a component of profits growth. UBS bearers declined SFr19 to SFr1,256 and the registered shares were SFr2 lower at SFr306. Comments by the board chairman that UBS would not abandon its plan to create a single bearer class, even if the motion were defeated at the November 22 egm, prompted concerns about a long legal battle ahead with BK Vision, which retreated SFr30 to SFr1,405. Among dollar earners, Nestle fell to a low of SFr1,167 before erasing some of the loss to finish SFr5 easier at SFr1,179. MILAN continued lower, with investors still waiting for the political situation to become clearer, and for confirmation that the 1995 budget would be passed, largely intact. The Comit index shed 5.06 to 621.60, a level last seen in late January, and 23.9 per cent below April's peak during the euphoria which followed Mr Silvio Berlusconi's general election success. Blue chips were broadly lower, Fiat dipping L149 to L6,051, Olivetti L45 to L1,813 and Telecom Italia L87 to L3,985. Pirelli contained its loss to L6 at L2,210 after its sharp falls of the previous two sessions: Seaq International in London said yesterday that Monday's exceptionally large volume of 57m shares was the result of technical trading involving repurchase transactions. Against the trend, Gaic continued to rise, adding L30 at L801 following Monday's comments by Ferruzzi's chairman about the future treatment of its Gaic stake. Ferruzzi gave up L33 at L1,270. AMSTERDAM was broadly neutral ahead of tomorrow's options expiry, and the AEX index finished 1.49 off at 404.01. Weakness in bonds followed through into the financial sector during the afternoon, with ING, for example, down Fl 1.00 at Fl 78.00. MADRID produced an intraday bounce of about 1 1/2 per cent from its day's lows, the general index closing only 0.16 down at 296.53 after early falls on debt market weakness. ISTANBUL, beset by inflation and a severe underperformer in dollar terms this year, saw its domestic index drop 924.27 or 3.6 per cent to 24,894.23 as liquid funds stayed away from the equity market.

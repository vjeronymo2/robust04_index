			<p>BFN     [Text] The allegations that the stand concerning the ways  to resolve the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina taken by President  Boris Yeltsin seriously differs from that of Russia's Foreign  Ministry are contrary to reality. "They are nothing but  conjectures," a spokesman for the ministry, Mikhail Demurin,  said at Thursday's briefing in Moscow.    According to him, "when formulating Moscow's attitude to the  ways to resolve the crisis in Bosnia, the Russian president  takes into account the entire range of views prevailing among  the legislative and executive authorities, including  recommendations given by Russia's Foreign Ministry."    Moscow, Demurin noted, "will continue its work with the  Bosnian Serbs." "The statement made by the special envoy of the  Russian president, Vitaly Churkin, as to an end to all talks  with the Serbs, was interpreted incorrectly. Churkin meant only  the crisis in and around Gorazde. Additional contacts with  Bosnian Serbs in regard to that problem were not required. They  had been told everything," he said.    As Demurin said, "some positive shifts have emerged in  regard  to the possibility of defusing the situation in Bosnia."  "According to the information arriving from Bosnia, all U.N.  representatives have been freed, and the 18 anti-aircraft guns  seized by the Serbs previously have been returned. The U.N.  representatives have not yet arrived in the area of Gorazde for  purely technical reasons," he said.    "The special envoy of the U.N. secretary General, Yasushi  Akashi, is satisfied with his contacts with the leaders of  Bosnian Serbs, who promised to halt military actions in the  three-kilometer zone surrounding Gorazde," Demurin said.    With reference to the possibility of gradually lifting the  international sanctions imposed against Belgrade, the Foreign  Ministry spokesman stressed that "in the future this issue  should be present in the unified stand to be taken by the world  community." "Such stand is to be worked out yet. When lifting  sanctions imposed on the Serbs the world community must see  prospects for resolving the conflict," he said.    According to Demurin, "there are people with obviously  militarist thinking among the Bosnian Serbs and in Belgrade."  "The sober-minded Serbs in Bosnia and in the Republic of  Yugoslavia should distance themselves from them. We shall  support any efforts aimed at resolving the crisis in Bosnia  peacefully," he concluded.</p>

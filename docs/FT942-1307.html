			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / International Company News: Labatt lifted by strong brewing operations John Labatt, one of Canada's two largest brewers, said new products helped to push beer sales up 4 per cent to CDollars 389m (USDollars 278m) in the fourth quarter ended April 30, and up 6 per cent to CDollars 1.8bn for the full year. Operating profit rose 19 per cent for the year to CDollars 260m, with Canadian brewing operations leading the way. However, the US operations also did well, showing 18 per cent growth in volume and benefiting from removal of the tariff on Ontario beer exports to the US last August. In Europe, Birra Moretti's operating results improved and UK sales rose sharply with inclusion of pub revenues. Since the year end, Labatt has added 168 pubs, bringing the total to more than 500 in England and Wales. The broadcasting, sports and entertainment group posted a 15 per cent gain in sales for the year, but operating profit slipped because of losses in an entertainment unit. Overall, Labatt reported consolidated fourth-quarter net profit from continuing operations of CDollars 28m, or 26 cents a share, up from CDollars 9m, or 5 cents, a year earlier on total revenues of CDollars 516m, up 16 per cent. For the full year, net profit was CDollars 155m, or CDollars 1.53 a share, up 17 per cent from CDollars 133m, or CDollars 1.32, in 1993. Sales were CDollars 2.3bn, up 9 per cent. The year-earlier period excluded special charges taken mainly for the writedown of Labatt's US dairy business to net realisable value.</p>

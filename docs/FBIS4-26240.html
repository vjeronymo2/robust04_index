			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 18 (XINHUA) -- The Association for  Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) of the mainland  suggested in a letter to the Taiwan-based Straits Exchange  Foundation (SEF) Friday [17 June] to hold further talks between  the two organizations soon.    The letter said that ARATS hopes the negotiations will help  resolve disputes at an early date and help them to finalize  three other agreements, including one involving the repatriation  of people who entered the other side through illegal means.    The fourth business-like negotiations, which were held  earlier this year, did not reach expected results due to various  factors, said the letter.    Tang Shubei, executive vice-chairman of ARATS, said in a  separate letter to Chiao Jen Ho [Jiao Renhe], vice-chairman of  SEF, that he hopes both Jiao and he would make joint efforts to  help promote cooperation between the two organizations and  improve relations across the Taiwan Straits.    The letter said that in accordance with agreements reached  earlier, the time to hold the bi-annual meeting between  officials in charge of the two organizations and the quarterly  meeting between officials at the deputy secretary general level  will come soon.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf by </F> radio correspondent Jayda'; place and date not given; from the  "Today's Guest" program]    [Text] [Jayda'] We are pleased to meet with Iraqi Foreign  Minister Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf.    [Al-Sahhaf] I welcome you.    [Jayda'] [words indistinct] discussion of lifting the  embargo from Iraq. To what extent has Iraq responded to the UN  Security Council resolutions?    [Al-Sahhaf] Iraq has responded to the UN Security Council  resolutions, particularly Resolution 687. This is documented in  the UN Security Council records. That is why Iraq recently  asked the UN Security Council in a letter signed by Deputy Prime  Minister Tariq 'Aziz to fulfill its commitments and implement  Paragraph 22 of Resolution 687 which calls for lifting the  economic embargo from Iraq. Within the Arab League framework,  we are supported by the general secretariat and the secretary  general to maintain the atmopshere that calls for lifting the  embargo from Iraq and the Iraqi people. We did not submit a  draft resolution to the Arab League Council because we do not  want one, two, or three members to come out with harmful  political objectives, thus showing that the Arabs disagree on  Iraq's request. We remain satisfied with the general atmopshere  of support provided by the Arab League secretary general.    [Jayda'] Your Excellency, what is the truth behind what is  being reported on there being Kuwaiti prisoners in Iraq and what  is Iraq's stand on this issue?    [Al-Sahhaf] There are no prisoners in Iraq. We [words  indistinct] through the International Committee of the Red Cross  [ICRC]. Others became aware that the issue is one of missing  people. There are internationally acknowledged procedures and  rules for following up the issue of missing people, not to  mention that the ICRC also follows up such issues. In the  aggression against Iraq, and during the crisis, there were  missing people. One should search for them, and collect  information about them. This takes time, and this is not the  first time that this happens. In all crises, wars, and armed  conflicts, people are reported missing. The search for them  continues. As you know, the Americans are still following up  the issue of those missing in action in Vietnman. This issue is  similar to the other. They waged an all-out war against Iraq.  One can say that it was a third world war against Iraq. There  were victims in this war, and people were reported missing. The  question is one of missing people. We cooperate in accordance  with acknowledged procedures to collect any information we might  obtain during our invesigation, and search to determine the fate  of these missing people. There are also tens of thousands of  Iraqis who are reported missing. We will also ask that searches  be carried out, investigations conducted, and information  collected on them.    [Jayda'] Your Excellency Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf, what are  the dimensions of the Iraq-Gulf relationship in light of opening  channels with Qatar, Oman, and recently with Bahrain?    [Al-Sahhaf] These are the dimensions of an Arab relationship  between two Arab countries. These are normal dimensions. Iraqi  relations exist with our brothers in the Gulf, particularly with  Oman, Qatar, and Bahrain. We seek to promote these relations.  This is a joint effort and a common desire between us and our  brothers in these three Arab countries. God willing, these  normal relations with the brothers will witness broader scopes  of cooperation and joint action.    [Jayda'] Mr. Minister, how does the Kurdish problem affect  the domestic state of affairs in Iraq, and how true are the  reports about foreign assistance?    [Al-Sahhaf] As a result of the U.S.-led imperialist game in  northern Iraq, northern Iraq has become an arena for gangs,  killings, and plundering. They are even stealing electricity  poles and selling them in Iran. Therefore, great harm has been  inflicted since 1991 when the U.S. and allied forces interfered  in northern Iraq and supported gangs there. The harm done to  the sons of our Kurdish people in Iraq is very great. There are  epidemics there. Nothing is available there. People in northern  Iraq are suffering greatly. There is no security. Killings and  thefts are everywhere. This inflicts great harm on Iraq because  that part of Iraq, northern Iraq, is a beloved part. It goes  without saying that there are Arab parties -- we are not  leveling accusations lightly but on the bases of facts and  information -- which provide thse gangs with money and weapons.    [Jayda'] The question of Arab reconciliation was supposed  to top the agenda of the meeting of Arab foreign ministers.  What is Iraq's role in Arab reconciliation?    [Al-Sahhaf] You know that the Arab League secretary general  has put forward an initiative for pan-Arab reconciliation. The  initiative contains ideas and suggestions. The Arab League  secretary general asked Arab states to make observations and  comments on this initiative. As an Arab country that fully  embraces pan-Arab action and joint Arab action, the initiative  was given due attention. Thus, we studied it carefully and sent  our observations to the secretary general. We criticized some  paragraphs containing points which we thought were inaccurate  and did not give the question its proper scope and should be  developed to complete what was missing. On the other hand, we  supported other paragraphs because we thought they were  appropriate and correct. Therefore, we presented a mature,  studied paper as a contribution from Iraq to the secretary  general, upon his request, so that different views would lead to  a feasible program that brings about pan-Arab reconciliation.    [Jayda'] Mr. Minister, what are the latest developments in  the relations with the West, particularly Iraqi-French relations?    [Al-Sahhaf] You know that diplomatic relations with all  European states, except Britain and France, remained in place.  As for Britain and France, after agreeing with them, a section  to look after interests was opened in their capitals. In turn,  they have asked the embassies of some countries in Baghdad to  look after their interests. Thus, relations continued to exist  through this diplomatic channel. Relations in terms of trade,  mutual interests, and the economy do not exist because of the  Iraq embargo. However, I can characterize the relationship  between Iraq and European nations as follows: Iraq's  relationship with these countries, as reflected through  companies, is a good relationship. Hundreds of European  companies come to Baghdad. However, relations with governments  exist only through an ordinary diplomatic channel and that is  all.    [Jayda'] Are their any developments in French relations?    [Al-Sahhaf] Yes, regarding Iraqi-French relations, there has  been a positive change in relations between the two countries,  which was only natural because relations of cooperation and  mutual interests between Iraq and France are broad and large and  deserve careful consideration. The two countries have resumed  coordination and activation of the previous relationship. We  have covered a considerable distance in this regard, and the  relationship between Iraq and France is now proceeding in the  right direction. We hope it will continue along this road until  it returns to its previous status, if not better.    [Jayda'] Mr. Minister, is Iraq willing to normalize  relations with the United States?    [Al-Sahhaf] Even when the president of the United States was  George Bush himself, who led the brute aggression against Iraq,  we told the Americans we were willing to talk and to have an  equal, serious dialogue. This proves that Iraq believes -- and  we truly believe in this -- that dialogue is not to be held with  one party alone, excluding others. As long as there are  possible interests, we believe that the way to serve these  interests is dialogue. We have no problem with that. We  continue to call for dialogue, and if the same desire and  political will are available for the other party, then there  will be dialogue. This is a natural thing between all countries.    [Jayda'] To conclude this conversation, I would like to know  your assessment of the Arab foreign minister conference in Cairo  at the Arab League?    [Al-Sahhaf] This meeting did not address many substantive  issues. There were several important issues on the agenda.  However, these require further consideration and discussion to  become mature enough and ready to make appropriate decisions on  them. There were positive discussions that underline a mutual  desire to see work develop within the Arab League and within  other frameworks of joint Arab action. We think this approach  should be promoted and supported to enable it to develop  further. Regarding some hot issues, the Arab League, as you  know, has adopted positive positions on these issues, such as  the crime of the massacre at the holy Ibrahimi Mosque and  support for the Palestinian people. There is active follow-up  on economic issues. Credit here goes really to the activity of  the Arab League secretary general and the General Secretariat of  the Arab League.    [Jayda'] Thank you Mr. Minister.    [Al-Sahhaf] You are welcome.</p>

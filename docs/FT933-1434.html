			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Reforms on health face stern test PARTISAN battle lines were being drawn in the US yesterday after President Bill Clinton's address to Congress on Wednesday night in which he outlined his ambitious plans for health care reform. After weeks in which Republican leaders had been expressing their admiration for the work put in by Mr Clinton and his wife on the reforms, it took just minutes for the pretence of bipartisan compromise to evaporate. While some Republican right wingers such as Senator Phil Gramm of Texas and Congressman Newt Gingrich of Georgia have been critical all along of Mr Clinton's plan, most of the Republican leadership has seen much in common with their own approaches to reform. Congresswoman Nancy Johnson of Connecticut patronisingly and inaccurately called Mr Clinton a latecomer to the debate over health care, and said his plan would create a 'one size fits all' state run monopoly. Senator Connie Mack of Florida attacked the government's role in Mr Clinton's health care proposals. 'It's loaded with more spending and more bureaucracy. It will devastate jobs and our economy. It will lead us to a system of government controlled health care at a cost of Dollars 700bn,' he said. The White House yesterday issued a statement deploring the Republican response. 'This health care system of ours is badly broken and it is time to fix it,' Mr Clinton said in his speech. The Republican criticism focussed on some of the questions likely to be at the heart of debate in the next few months: would Mr Clinton's reform reduce the ability to choose your own doctor? Would it produce a new and cumbersome federal bureaucracy? Should employers have to pay for most of their workers' health care costs? Is there enough money to be saved to pay for expanded coverage? Opinion polls have for some time suggested the Republicans would have a hard time making their case. Instant polling after Mr Clinton's speech on Wednesday night by both USA Today/Gallup and the Washington Post/ABC showed that 55-56 per cent now favoured his reform plan ' a substantial leap in approval. Most expected no reduction in their own medical choices. Harsh medicine's tastegood factor, Page 19</p>

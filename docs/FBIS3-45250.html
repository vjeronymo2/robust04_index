			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Xu Rujun (1776 1172 0193) and </F> XINHUA reporter Huang Qiusheng (7806 4428 3932)]    [Excerpts] Nanjing, 14 Jan (XINHUA) -- Under the new  situation marked by reform, opening up, and development of a  socialist market economy, people in five provinces and one  municipality in eastern China, while launching reform and  opening up projects, have also been eagerly supporting the  military. [passage omitted] Recently, Nanjing Military Region  Commander Gu Hui and Political Commissar Fang Zuqi [2455 4371  1477] presented golden plaques -- engraved with characters:  "good logistics supporters of the military" -- to 13 units,  including the Fujian Provincial Government office in charge of  support-the-front affairs.    One common understanding shared by party and government  departments of Fujian, Jiangsu, Shanghai, Zhejiang, Anhui, and  Jiangsu in eastern China is that they must intensify their  support for the military at a time when efforts are being made  to speed up the pace of reform, opening up, and the development  of the socialist market economy. [passage omitted] Whenever a  major reform project was going to be launched, the local party  committees and governments always considered the military's  tolerance for a change first. In April 1993 after the state  decontrolled the grain market, the grain departments of these  provinces and Shanghai, in order to ensure the military's grain  supply, immediately set up 20 supply departments and hundreds of  supply depots in cities and regions where garrison troops were  concentrated and sold them quality grain at preferential prices  on a priority basis. Despite rising grain prices, the Shanghai  Municipal Government's office in charge of financial affairs and  trade did everything it could to sell 200,000 tonnes of grain to  the garrison troops at set prices.

			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Serco buoyed by organic growth Shares of Serco firmed 14p to 297p yesterday as the facilities and contract management group reported sharp organic growth within a 38 per cent interim profits advance. Turnover rose 46 per cent to Pounds 120m (Pounds 82.3m), with substantial new business gains helping existing operations expand sales by 21 per cent. The pre-tax outcome increased from Pounds 4.35m to Pounds 6m, although 17 per cent of the increase came from three companies acquired in the second half of 1993. Mr Richard White, chief executive, said: 'We see the trend we've set for organic growth being maintained.' Defence continues to account for close to 30 per cent of sales, and Mr White said there was substantial scope for new contracts, as the Ministry of Defence continues its efficiency drive by contracting out to the private sector. Serco recently won the MoD contract for air traffic control at Gibraltar airport, in addition to winning the civil contract for a range of services at Liverpool airport. Other new business included a new contract for maintenance of London's traffic signals, giving Serco maintenance responsibility for two thirds of the the capital's junctions. It also won a contract from Yorkshire Water for maintenance of its vehicles. When Serco was listed, 10 per cent of its staff worked overseas. The figure is now closer to 30 per cent, as it has expanded primarily in the US and Asia Pacific, and is currently targeting Scandinavia and Germany. Serco operates primarily under fixed rate contracts, of which about half are linked to an inflation index. It remains sensitive to increases in wages, however, which form its largest cost. Mr White said there were signs of increasing pressure on salaries, but he said that this was being factored into contract tenders. Serco is paying a 1.25p interim dividend, an increase of 18 per cent. Earnings per share rose 25 per cent to 5.6p (4.5p).</p>

			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / Economics: Markets seek inspiration from UK trade figures and new US activity IN A week shortened by public holidays in much of the industrialised world, markets will be seeking inspiration from the April UK trade figures today and later from new US activity and confidence data and preliminary cost of living figures for May from Germany and some of its western Lander. The Pounds 575m UK current account deficit in March was the best so far this year and markets will be waiting to see if this performance was maintained in April. Interest has mainly focused on the implications of the figures for the domestic UK economy. Imports performed better than exports in the first quarter and this trend, if continued, could reinforce signs of economic recovery in the UK. Given the uncertainties about the US recovery, today's Conference Board consumer confidence index and Friday's Chicago purchasing managers' index are likely to command more attention than the preliminary first quarter GDP figures, also due on Friday. The German preliminary cost of living figures are likely to show no fall in headline inflation and therefore offer no encouragement to hopes of lower German interest rates. Highlights of the week ahead, with the median of forecasts in brackets from MMS International, the financial information company, include: Today: UK, Current account balance of payments (Pounds 600m deficit) and trade figures for April (Pounds 900m deficit).

			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Survey of Italy (12):: Differences that still run deep - The North-South Divide MR Salvatore Ligresti, one of the richest men in Italy and a leading force in property, insurance and building, recalls his arrival as a young man in the northern city of Padua from his native Sicily one cold winter's morning in the early 1950s. Barely out of the railway station, he walked to a waiting taxi with his heavy bags to take him to his lodgings. 'Commandi' - at your command - said the driver, using a familiar local expression. Mr Ligresti was astounded. Here he was, a humble Sicilian student, in the heart of the rich north, about which he had heard so much, being asked for orders. Plucking up courage, he gave the address of his destination. Only later would he learn that 'commandi' was a commonplace local politeness towards customers. Late to nationhood, Italy after 1945 has been guided by the constant thread of ironing out regional differences and creating a unitary state. While billions of lire have been pumped into the Mezzogiorno to stimulate economic development and reduce the dependence on agriculture, the tendency in the north has been for differences to decline, partly because of the huge inflow of southerners like Mr Ligresti since the late 1950s. But in an economy going through its most difficult phase since the early 1980s, that philosophy is being increasingly called into doubt today. Reinforced by the biggest changes to the political system since 1945 and the recent focus on morality in politics after a string of urban corruption scandals, one of the most basic principles of Italian life is now under scrutiny. The political mould has cracked further with the rise in support for regional autonomist parties, chiefly the Milan-based Lombard League. Part of a north Italian political grouping, which goes under the collective title of the Lega Nord, the Lombard League has turned into a potent political force, capturing up to 25 per cent of the vote in some big Lombard cities. Overall, the Lega Nord performed spectacularly at the April 5 general election, beating the Christian Democrats into second place in Lombardy, Italy's richest region, and capturing 8.7 per cent of the vote nationwide. The League now has 55 deputies in the lower house of parliament. Greater autonomy for northern Italy - even outright separatism, according to some extremists - was a central plank of the league's election programme. Angered at northern taxes being 'squandered' on worthless subsidies to the south, the league has made much of its 'closer to Europe and further from Rome' slogan. Such developments have raised doubts as to whether the assumptions on which such decisions as phasing out regional dialects in schools are still valid. Is the entire post-war effort based on creating an increasingly uniform Italy now going into reverse? One prominent parliamentarian from the Lombard League last month threatened the organisation would be 'oiling the Kalashnikovs' should the new government not take steps to meet the league's demands for greater autonomy. The remark was deliberately inflammatory. However, it indicated the expectations which have now been raised, and gave a taste  - if exaggerated  -of the anger that could emerge if Mr Amato does not make at least some gesture towards greater regional rights. Yet for all the efforts of s u c c e s s i v e governments to narrow the north-south divide, regional differences remain vast. Take the yawning gap between the wealthy, German-speaking Alto Adige on the border with Austria, where adherents of the local Sudtiroler Volks Partei (SVP) assert their Teutonic roots, and life in the squalid apartment blocks on the fringes of Palermo. For many northerners, the s o u t h is terra incognita, ravaged by the Mafia in Sicily, and its sister organisations in Campania and Calabria. The recent revelations about organised political corruption in Milan and other big northern cities have done little to level many northerners' sense of moral superiority over their southern counterparts. Even within the south, differences are great. Away from the preened golf courses of the C o s t a S m e r a l d a, Sardinia remains a harsh island with a strong local culture and language, where kidnapping, as a recent example shows, remains a way of life for some. By contrast, a new economic boom has been under way on the agricultural plain of Apulia, where the Appenine mountains finally run out before reaching the sea. The upsurge has been based not just on farming, but also industrial activities. However, the companies that have started are not the state-funded 'cathedrals in the desert', established more for political than economic reasons, but small and medium-sized businesses, some of which will fail, but many of which are set to thrive. A plethora of data shows how divided Italy remains. Average unemployment in the south is running at 19.3 per cent, against 6.2 per cent in the centre and north of the country. Most of those looking for jobs in the Mezzogiorno are between the ages of 14 and 29, and many face the serious prospect of reaching middle age without ever having worked, noted Mr Antonio Fazio, the Bank of Italy's chief economist, in a speech last December. Economically, the south remains well behind the north, in spite of the immense amounts of cash dispensed. Per capita income in the Mezzogiorno is 58 per cent of that in the rest of Italy, while differences between the richest provinces of the north and the poorest of the south are even more acute. Many companies have opted for the south because of generous investment grants, rather than market forces. A substantial proportion of the investment in Fiat's new car and engine plants in southern Italy will be met from the public purse. Meanwhile, many state-owned groups have had their arms twisted to locate new factories in the south for political reasons. With tighter controls on public spending as a result of the ballooning deficit, less cash will be available to the south in future. Yet the Bank of Italy's Mr Fazio recognises that 'external diseconomies' such as lower educational standards, poor training and inadequate public services are prominent factors in explaining the south's lower productivity. Even in terms of transportation, the infrastructure of road and rail links is only around 80 per cent of the level of that in central and northern Italy, he argued. To some extent, Italy's north-south divide is inevitable. As a long, thin peninsula, it is not surprising that a northern city like Milan lies closer to some of Europe's main business centres than it does to Naples, let alone Catania. Italy's shape accentuates the differences between its two halves. The development of a motorway network in the 1960s helped to narrow the gap, but distances remain substantial. The rise of domestic air travel has also improved contacts between the two parts of the country, but high prices make frequent flying prohibitive for most Italians, especially from the south. Some experts have pinned their hopes on the development of a high-speed rail network to reduce journey times while keeping ticket costs affordable. But under the present scheme, Italy's high-speed network, shaped like a letter 'T' with Milan at its tip, will run no further south than Naples, leaving Calabria - let alone Sicily - marooned. Some economists doubt whether pushing the new line even as far south as Naples is justifiable. Even employees of the state railways admit that, while seats on the existing fast 'Pendolino' service between Milan and Rome are regularly full at peak commuting times, services south of the capital run largely empty and owe their existence more to political than economic considerations.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 20 KYODO -- Former Chief Cabinet  Secretary Masayoshi Takemura on Monday [20 June] expressed hope  that a reconfiguration of political parties will be achieved, as  quickly as possible, to put an end to the current political  disarray in Japan.    "I don't think it is good for the political community to  continue shaking," Takemura said in a lecture hosted by KYODO  NEWS SERVICE. "I want to find a specific course for political  realignment at an early date."    Takemura, who heads new party Sakigake [Harbinger], also  voiced his hope that the primary opposition Liberal Democratic  Party (LDP) will split, in response to its internal differences  over key policies and political beliefs, and merge with other  political parties.    Saying the once-dominant LDP's historical role is over,  Takemura predicted the anticipated political realignment will  engulf the LDP and the Social Democratic Party (SDP) [Social  Democratic Party of Japan (SDPJ]), the second largest opposition  force.    The leader of the 15-member new party Sakigake described the  rule by the current minority coalition government of Prime  Minister Tsutomu Hata as an "abnormal situation" and spoke of  the need to form a stable majority administration in one way or  another.    The SDP, the largest contingent of the government of former  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, quit the ruling coalition in  April, leaving Hata overseeing Japan's first minority government  since 1955.    New party Sakigake, an LDP breakaway and also a member of  the  previous administration, fled the governing alliance because of  differences with its coalition partners over political  strategies.</p>

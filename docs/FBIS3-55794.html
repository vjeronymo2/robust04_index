ITAR-TASS has learned from military sources in Dushanbe that  there were no casualties among Russian servicemen.    According to the same sources, the number of armed  provocations on some sectors of the Tajik-Afghan border has  increased sharply since early January. For instance, fire was  opened on the deployment area of the 13th post of the Moskovskiy  border guard detachment on Sunday. Tajik mujaheds fired eight  shells at the post from Afghan territory.    Borderguards of the Pyanj detachment have cut short three  attempts of small groups of Tajik opposition fighters to break  into Tajikistan from Afghan territory in the past five days.</p>

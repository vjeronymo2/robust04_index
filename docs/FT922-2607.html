			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / BIS Annual Report: Multinationals switch focus of investment MULTINATIONAL companies shifted emphasis in their investment strategies last year away from the industrial world and towards developing nations, the BIS annual report says. Latin America was one large beneficiary of the diversion in spending power, which was due partly to the fragility of the economies in many developed nations and to the increased interest by many large companies in building up operations in the non-industrialised world. Meanwhile, Japanese overseas investment, especially in the US, was sharply curtailed. The BIS says this reflects both the weak state of the US economy and the relatively poor returns by Japanese companies on their capital spending in North America. Eastern Europe also saw a large increase in foreign investment, although from a small base. Total foreign investment, which is mainly by western-based multinational companies, reached an estimated Dollars 177.3bn last year, about a fifth down on the Dollars 222.4bn in 1990. In terms of the direction of investment, spending in the industrial countries came to Dollars 115.2bn, 23 per cent down from Dollars 148.7bn in 1990. Investment in the developing nations came to Dollars 42.7bn, 38 per cent up on the Dollars 30.9bn recorded in the previous year. Of total foreign investment, the share which ended up in the industrial world went down to 73 per cent from 83 per cent in 1990, while the share in the developing countries increased to 27 per cent from 17 per cent. Spending in Latin America rose to Dollars 12bn from Dollars 7.8bn, largely due to liberalisation in trade policies, greater openness to foreign involvement and more stable macroeconomic policies. Investment in Asia also showed a steady increase to Dollars 25.7bn from Dollars 19.9bn. As well as reflecting the activities of western-based multinational companies, much of this spending came from funds supplied by companies in high-income Asian countries such as Taiwan and South Korea, which flowed into lower income nations including China, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand. Investment by overseas businesses in eastern Europe reached Dollars 2.3bn in 1991, after just Dollars 500m the year before.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- GLOBAL PATTERN OF DIRECT INVESTMENT (Dollars bn, annual averages)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         1975-79   1980-84   1985-89     1990     1991  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- OUTFLOWS Industrial countries       34.7      41.0     128.4    209.5    165.5   US                       15.9       9.6      22.8     33.4     29.5   Japan                     2.1       4.3      23.8     48.0     30.7   European Community       14.2      20.9      59.4     97.5     80.5 Developing countries        0.6       1.4       6.5     12.9     11.8   Asia                      0.3       0.8       5.6     11.2     10.3   Latin America             0.1       0.2       0.4      1.1      1.0 TOTAL                      35.3      42.4     134.9    222.4    177.3  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- INFLOWS Industrial countries       19.9      36.2      98.1    148.7    115.2   US                        6.1      18.6      48.2     37.2     22.2   Japan                     0.1       0.3       0.1      1.8      1.4   European Community       11.4      14.2      38.4     85.9     67.7 Developing countries        7.0      16.4      19.5     30.9     42.7   Asia                      1.9       4.7      10.8     19.9     25.7   Eastern Europe            0.0       0.1       0.1      0.5      2.3   Latin America             3.6       5.4       5.7      7.8     12.0 TOTAL                      26.9      52.6     117.6    179.6    157.9  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Discrepancy in total outflows and inflows is due to official reporting errors.

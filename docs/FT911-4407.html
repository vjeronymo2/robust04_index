			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / International Company News: Comalco to step up cutbacks at smelter STRUGGLING to maintain earnings in the face of falling aluminium prices, Australia's Comalco has increased sackings and cutbacks at its huge Boyne Island smelter on the central Queensland coast. Comalco also has deferred a ADollars 1bn (Dollars 780m) expansion of its plant following the stalling in negotiations with the state government over the purchase of the nearby Gladstone power station which supplies power to the smelter. A subsidiary of resource group CRA, Comalco's net profit fell 33 per cent to ADollars 181m for 1990 and the company expects a further deterioration in earnings this year. Comalco partly blames the recession in Australia for the downturn, but the international aluminium price fall over the last three years has taken the biggest toll on earnings.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] At the moment, more than 50 research nuclear  reactors are functioning in Moscow, but none of them is equipped  with safety accessories such as protection shields.  Nevertheless, only three reactors of the Kurchatov research  center have been closed down since 1992. To make matters worse,  they are likely to be brought on-line again in the near future,  the former head of the Moscow inspection unit of the State  Atomic Supervision Committee (SASC), Vladimir Kuznetsov, told  Interfax Wednesday.    Speaking at a news conference in Moscow, he said the  situation with safety precautions on the territories of research  centers in Moscow was "disastrous."    "The inspection revealed an awful lot of violations. For  example, a reactor in the Kurchatov institute has been exploited  at two times the capacity it was designed for. While halting  another reactor in the Theoretical and Experimental Physics  Institute, all its territory was contaminated, and radioactivity  is likely to proliferate beyond its limits," he said.    Kuznetsov disagreed with the wide-spread opinion that  research reactors are low-capacity, and that the contamination  will not be serious in case of an accident. As many research  centers, in particular, the Kurchatov Institute, were located  within the city limits, an accident will lead to the  contamination of homes, hospitals, kindergartens, etc.    Another participant of the news conference, employee of the  SASC Research and Scientific Center Vladimir Moskalenko pointed  to the "outrageous condition of technical equipment of the  reactors."    He said the obligatory check for ionizing emanation was  either neglected, or the equipment was so insensitive that the  probes could not be correct. He also said there was practically  no control of leakages of radioactive gases and aerosols to the  atmosphere.    The former employees of the SASC sent an open letter to the  State Duma and the Federation Council with a proposal to  consider the inexpediency of further use of nuclear  installations in Moscow due to a possible disaster.</p>

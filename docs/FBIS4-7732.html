			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Aleksander Malkiewicz: "CEFTA--Past and Future; </F> A Market Like the EC's?"]    [Text] "In the next two years, we shall be repaying our  roughly $87 million debt to the Czech Republic and Slovakia in  the form of construction services and coal and equipment  shipments," declared Maciej Lesny at a press conference. Lesny  is an under secretary of state at the Ministry of Foreign  Economic Cooperation and the head of the Polish negotiating  mission. He made this declaration following his return from the  Prague meeting of the Joint Committee of CEFTA (Central European  Free Trade Agreement signed on 21 December 1992 in Krakow by the  Czech Republic, the Polish Republic, the Slovak Republic, and  the Hungarian Republic). Under that agreement, a free trade zone  is to be established among these countries by 1998. "An  understanding to hasten the liberalization of trade among  Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary will be  reached by the end of April or the beginning of May of this  year," Minister Lesny emphasized.    The gradual abolition of tariffs among the member countries  of CEFTA, which represents a market of 65 million consumers, is  intended to increase mutual trade, whose volume at present does  not exceed $1 billion. Accordingly, the Prague meeting resolved  to reduce by one-third the duties on industrial goods as early  as on 1 July 1994. This is in the spirit of the provisions of  the CEFTA agreement.    Unlike the agreements with the EC and EFTA [European Free  Trade Association], the Central European agreement is based on  the principle of equivalence and reciprocal advantages, meaning  that all of the parties are to benefit equally from liberalized  trade terms.    The agreement between Poland and its southern neighbor  states  reflects a compromise reached in the course of long and often  dramatic negotiations. The main points of contention concerned  the tariff abolition timetables and the division of manufactured  goods into three groups among our countries, with separate  duty-slashing schedules for each of these groups. Relatively  speaking, the boldest attitude in this matter was represented,  as the deputy minister explained, by Czechoslovakia, which has  been levying customs duties of as little as several percent  since 1991. In its turn, the position of Hungary, which has also  been applying relatively low (though higher than the  Czechoslovak) duty rates, was dictated by the desire to match  these rates to those specified in its agreements with the EC and  EFTA, which provide for completing the Hungarian reductions of  duty rates by 1 January 2001. To Poland, which has during these  negotiations been levying the highest duty rates among CEFTA  members, an earlier date was acceptable because, as is known,  duties on manufactured goods deriving from the EC and EFTA will  be, with a few exceptions, abolished by 1 January 1999.    In effect, duties on the first group of merchandise, the  so-called List A, were to be immediately abolished on the  effective date of the agreement--that is, as of 1 May 1993. In  general, that group comprises relatively unprocessed goods  (among other things, raw materials and semifinished products).  As a result, and owing to the even earlier applicable zero duty  rates, approximately 50-60 percent of Polish exports to the  Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary are duty-exempt. As for  the second group of merchandise, the so-called List B, which  comprises goods of medium susceptibility [to foreign  competition], the related duties will be reduced in three equal  installments of one-third each during the period between 1  January 1995 and 1 January 1997. The so-called List C includes  goods most susceptible to foreign competition, such as textile,  metal, automotive, electronic, and similar products. The related  duties will be reduced to zero in seven installments during the  period from 1 January 1995 to 1 January 2001.    The CEFTA member countries also pledged themselves to  gradually abolish the existing nontariff restraints on trade  (such as concessions, import quotas, import and export  prohibitions) and to refrain from introducing any new such  restraints in mutual trade.    The problem of farm products received special treatment  under  CEFTA. No member country was prepared to fully open its  agricultural and food market, and, hence, liberalization in that  domain extended to only a few commodities, mostly in  quantitative terms. In the case of agricultural products, the  existing regulations remain binding, and new ones, protecting  against foreign competition, may be introduced.    The text of CEFTA also provides for a gradual attainment of  world standards (developed under GATT) by the parties thereto  upon employing economic instruments distorting [as published]  free competition in world trade.    This concerns, among other things, nondiscriminating  domestic  taxation, policy on state monopolies, rules of competition and  governmental economic aid to enterprises, manufacturing orders,  and antidumping measures.    Strictly speaking, CEFTA is not an integrative agreement to  create an organization similar to that of the European  Community, the European Union [EU], or EFTA. It does not provide  for permanent bodies such as the EU Commission or the EFTA  Secretariat.    This approach is dictated by the idea that an excessive  institutionalization of economic cooperation may engender a  mistaken belief in the political and economic self-sufficiency  of the countries of Central Europe.    The more than a year that has passed since the provisions of  CEFTA began to be implemented is, in the opinion of experts, too  short a period to assess in detail its effect on the structure  and volume of trade. But it can be stated that, even now, our  country is deriving measurable advantages: In 1993, its balance  of trade with the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary was  positive.    Although these countries, taken together, account for merely  7-8 percent of our foreign trade, they rank among the 10 biggest  Polish trade partners.    Even as CEFTA was being signed, the signatories provided for  the possibility of modifying its provisions. Their concurrently  signed joint political declaration of 21 December 1992 mentions  the desire to hasten and broaden the liberalization of trade  beyond the terms of the original agreement. Since last March,  the partners have been discussing revisions of reciprocal  concessions that will probably result, after 1 January 1998, in  abolishing a definite majority of duties on manufactured goods  as well as in marked reductions of duties on and increases in  quotas for farm products.    Moreover, during the negotiations in Prague, it was decided  to advance to 1 July 1994 from 1 January 1995 the commencement  of the abolition of duties. Merchandise on List A will become  nondutiable as early as at the beginning of next year. The duty  rates on merchandise on List B will be reduced in three stages:  on 1 July 1994, on 1 January 1996, and on 1 January 1997. Trade  in susceptible [to foreign competition] merchandise (metal  products, textiles, some chemicals) will be liberalized in four  stages.    The text of CEFTA allows its signatories to conclude  agreements on free trade with other countries, as well.  According to Minister Lesny, such agreements are to be concluded  [between Poland and] Turkey, Romania, and Israel.    Negotiations with the Baltic republics are also under way.  For the time being, a highly liberalized flow of goods and  capital is to be possible within the next year or so among the  Czech Republic, Poland, Slovakia, and Hungary. This should  contribute to a more rapid integration with the West European  economic system and accelerate our membership in the EC and the  EU.</p>

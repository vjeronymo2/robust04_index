			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Rafael Pardo Rueda by </F> Manuel Monsalve from the National Defense Ministry on 29 May --  recorded]    [Text] [Pardo] The preliminary assessment of the election  process is that at the beginning of the day, there were some  problems at some voting tables located in several  municipalities. There were problems in 86 voting tables, but  these were subsequently solved. The most common problem were  those related to delegates not arriving on time. The voting  process was halted while the delegate in charge was being  replaced. In other cases, problems were mostly related to cases  of vandalism -- very few cases -- mostly destruction of election  material. We were able to observe problems [words indistinct]  in the partial results we now have. These results will mostly  be modified later on in practically 47 tables. I would like to  state that there are more than 45,000 voting tables [words  indistinct], and we only have had problems with less than 47  tables.    [Monsalve] Which departments presented problems?    [Pardo] In Veredas [words indistinct] less than two tables,  in 31 different communities. This did not undermine municipal  elections, however, or those places where there were more than  two tables. We were able to solve these problems.    [Monsalve] Mr. Minister, can you tell those Colombians who  were able to vote in the departments where there were the most  problems?    [Pardo] I repeat, the departments with the most problems  were  Bolivar, Norte de Santander, Santander, and Casanare. I repeat,  however, these were mostly problems that appeared in those  places where there were only one or two voting tables. [Words  indistinct] places where the voter turnout is quite low. I  expect to compare the information we now have on the 47 tables  where there were problems, with those of the 47,000 tables  distributed throughout the country.    [Monsalve] With respect to the 13 March voting process,  would  you say that security increased [words indistinct]?    [Pardo] Security, in comparison to 13 March, has increased  greatly and is much tighter. In this case, there were fewer  places affected. There were fewer incidents of voters being  prevented from voting and fewer incidents of vandalism than on  13 March.</p>

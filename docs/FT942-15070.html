			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Fish for feasting - Cookery My knowledge of South African cooking is minimal. I have tucked greedily into steaming dishes of bobotie, described as South Africa's answer to shepherd's pie, and I have feasted on marvellously aromatic mangoes whipped up into mousses and ice creams or simply cut from the stone in crescent moon slices. And that was it until a reader wrote and introduced me to one of her family's favourites. She serves it as a light lunch dish or a first course for dinner, with good bread and butter on the side and a salad of green leaves laced with slivers of avocado. CAPE PICKLED FISH (serves 6-8) Shut the doors and open the kitchen windows wide before you embark on this recipe and do not close the windows for an hour or so afterwards. Otherwise, the smell of frying fish and vinegar fumes might overpower the cook. Ingredients: 2 1/4 lb thick fillets of hake or cod, cut into 8-12 pieces; 7 fl oz oil; 3 large onions, sliced wafer thin;  1/4 lb pale muscavado sugar; 3 tablespoons finely-chopped chillies; 1 tablespoon finely-chopped fresh ginger root; 3 tablespoons curry powder; 2 teaspoons sea salt; 1 teaspoon lightly-toasted and crushed coriander seeds; 4 bay leaves; 1pt wine vinegar. Method: Wash the fish, thoroughly pat it dry and remove any visible bones. Heat  1/4 pt of the oil in a large, heavy-based frying pan until a light haze appears. Then, fry the fish in batches for three to four minutes on each side until golden brown. Drain well on crumpled kitchen paper. Discard the oil remaining in the pan. Wipe out the pan and put the remaining 2 fl oz of fresh oil into it. Heat it and saute the onions gently for 10 minutes or so until soft and golden. Sprinkle the onions with the sugar, add the chillies and ginger, curry powder, coriander, bay and salt and cook over a low flame for two minutes, stirring continuously. Mix the vinegar with  1/2 pt cold water and pour it into the pan in a thin, steady stream, stirring the contents of the pan all the time. Bring to the boil and then simmer, uncovered, over minimal heat for 10 minutes to allow flavours to blend and volume to reduce a little. Lay the fish in a dish, overlapping the pieces slightly to make them fit if necessary, and pour on the contents of the pan to immerse the fish completely. Cover tightly with food film and foil and refrigerate for at least two days before eating so the marinade permeates the fish well.</p>

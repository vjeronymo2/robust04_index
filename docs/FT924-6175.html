			<p>921123 FT  23 NOV 92 / Letter: Exactitude in home improvement pay-back Sir, I must take David Lascelles to task for a serious arithmo-economic inexactitude (Energy Efficiency survey: 'Overheated and under-insulated', November 17). In assessing the pay-back time on his potential home improvements, he has completely ignored 'opportunity cost' - that is, the loss of interest on the capital expended. This is a basic economic factor, and while one might tolerate such a naive approach from a DIY magazine, not the FT please] In the examples given, if his total investment is Pounds 3,010 then the lost interest, even at only 7 per cent, amount to Pounds 210 a year. This means that the true saving is Pounds 306 at the moment, not Pounds 516, and the pay-back time is not less than six years, it is more than 10. If capital is borrowed, the return will probably be negative. Reasonable insulation improvements are indeed desirable and usually economical, the notable exception being double-glazing, for which the pay-back time - after opportunity cost - is never.

			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / Arts: Today's Television Are good teachers born or made? BBC2 tries to find out with two documentaries called The Lion's Den (7.45). The cameras observe how the children in Class 10G at Alperton High School in Wembley behave with three different teachers: Lindsey Bird, who has had seven years experience, Peggy Jordan who has had 22, and Matthew Longden, fresh from college, who has been taken on to teach business studies but finds that he is also to be 10G's form tutor. 40 Minutes re-tells the story of the Nazis' 'lebensborn' scheme for peopling the Third Reich with a super race of pure Aryan children. Renate X, the subject of this programme (9.50) knew she was born at Steinboring in 1941, but never knew who her father was. When she eventually establishes his identity it is all too clear why her mother kept it such a secret. Channel 4 opens a 'Cinema Canada' season with Jesus Of Montreal (10.00), a movie about the mounting of a modern passion play. Viewpoint 92 screens the first of another pair of documentaries, this time about the modern hatred of ageing and the lengths to which people will go to hide it.</p>

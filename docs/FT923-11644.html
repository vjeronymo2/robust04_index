			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / British Gas to separate top jobs MR ROBERT EVANS, chairman and chief executive of British Gas, announced yesterday he was separating the two roles and ceding the post of chief executive to Mr Cedric Brown, senior managing director, ending months of speculation that such a move was imminent. Mr Charles Donovan, co-senior managing director and a competitor for the chief executive's role, announced his resignation after recognising the 'direct impact' Mr Brown's appointment would have on his duties. Mr Brown, 57, who joined British Gas in 1966, said he was 'delighted at the opportunity' to take on the job at a crucial time for the company. He will be responsible for the day-to-day running of the business, and will also examine changes needed to ensure the company meets its financial targets. Mr Evans will retain overall control of strategy, but the pair would work together closely, Mr Brown said. Analysts said major changes were unlikely, but suggested Mr Brown might take a more publicly combative role with the industry regulator Ofgas, The first test for the new chief executive will be reaching an agreement with Ofgas on tariffs and terms for the company's transportation and storage business, due to be hived off into an arm's-length subsidiary by October. Mr Brown said he was anxious that agreement should be reached as soon as possible, although Ofgas is thought unlikely to accept British Gas's submission that it should receive a rate of return of 10.8 per cent on new investment and 6.7 per cent on existing pipeline assets. He said he did not rule out a possible referral to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission if no agreement could be reached. The new chief executive must also manage attempts by British Gas to expand its global gas and exploration and production businesses. The company is to lose 50 per cent of its industrial supply business by 1995, and may soon face competition in the household supply market. The news had little effect on the British Gas share price, although analysts said the City might be disappointed the company had not brought in an outsider with more experience overseas and in a competitive industry.</p>

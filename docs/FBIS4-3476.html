The 37 persons are so-called "three-no" people, namely  without legal certificate, a proper job and lawful residence,  being found in lent accommodation and an "underground guest  house" in the Luohu District of the city yesterday when the  police conducted a sudden raid in the area.    These 37 people had entered the city as tourists and had not  returned to their own countries when their tourist documents  expired. They were instead illegally living, working, doing  business and taking part in activities in the city, posing  troubles to social order and the management of foreign affairs  there.

			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / Lockhart to lead MasterCard MasterCard International, the second-largest US credit card association, yesterday appointed former top Midland Bank executive Mr Eugene Lockhart as its new chief executive, just seven days after his predecessor unexpectedly resigned. Mr Lockhart, who has worked at the US bank consulting group First Manhattan since he left Midland in 1992, will take over in March from Mr Alex Hart, who announced last week that he was joining the financial services company Advanta. Mr Lockhart has been a member of MasterCard's board since 1990, and has acted as an adviser to the company's US operations for the past year. His experience in the credit card industry includes overseeing Midland Bank's large credit card business while he was chief executive of its UK operations, and working more recently with bank clients of First Manhattan on their credit card strategy. Mr Norman Tice, chairman of MasterCard's board of directors, said yesterday: 'In Gene we saw someone who had an unusual combination of line retail banking experience as well as experience in international consumer payments and technology.' The rapid appointment of a new chief executive at MasterCard will help reassure Wall Street. Mr Hart served as the company's chief executive for five years, and was widely credited with helping turn MasterCard's fortunes around after the company had lost market share throughout most of the 1980s. Mr Lockhart said yesterday that his main role will be to ensure that MasterCard continues to win a greater share of the US credit card market. Thanks primarily to the success of 'co-branded' cards - launched with non-bank partners like General Motors and AT&amp;T and which offer users discounts on those company's products - MasterCard's share of the volume of general-purpose card charges in the US has grown from 26.3 per cent in 1991 to 27.6 per cent last year. Visa International is the industry leader with 44.9 per cent of the market. Mr Lockhart said that he also would concentrate on building MasterCard's share of the debit card business.</p>

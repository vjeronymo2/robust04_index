			<p>Language: <F P=105> Belarusian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Vladimir Hancharyk, chairman of the Council of the  Belarusian Trade Union Federation, held a press conference today  at the National Press Center. As is known, the Federation did  not support the general political strike set for 15 February.  Let us remind you that the question is open as the strike was  postponed to 22 February -- the day when the Belarusian Supreme  Soviet will resume its session. The official trade unions, too,  may join the strike movement. Explaining the position of  Belarusian unions and, so to say, dotting all the i's and  crossing all the t's, Vladimir Hancharyk, the Council chairman,  commented on the current situation.    [Begin recording] [Hancharyk] The political strike did fail.  That is a fact. But the fact also is that public discontent is  extremely high. The reason why the strike has not taken place  -- and we have repeatedly stressed this -- is that it was  premature and poorly prepared. The main emphasis was put on  spontaneous rallies rather than well organized ones. Generally  speaking, the issue of strikes should be handled based on a good  preparation, and not on reasoning. Let us hold up traffic, or  something to this effect. This is especially conspicuous when we  take a look at the strike participants. There were very few  workers. Most of the strikers included intellectuals, students,  and some of our activists. People avoid going to extremes.  They are afraid to lose their jobs. This is why people decided  to stay out of it.    [Announcer] To stabilize the social and economic situation  of  the Republic, the union Federation presented its demands.  First, the Belarusian Supreme Soviet should call early  legislative elections no later than this October. Second, the  Cabinet of Ministers should urgently revamp and reconstruct the  government during the ongoing session. Unless the above demands  are not met, Hancharyk said the reaction of trade unions will be  firm.    [Hancharyk] We have come to the conclusion that the  Federation's position should be pretty tough. The clock will  start ticking from 22 February, the session's first day of work  after a break. The Federation's Presidium is to convene on 23  February to determine our further actions. If the Supreme  Soviet does not examine the above issue, we will have to cast a  secret ballot, as provided by law, in our local organizations,  followed by massive rallies in early March. But this time,  these will be organized rallies. I am talking about a warning  strike. According to the law, we have three hours. As for the  laws, all of them have a distinct anti-union orientation. The  issue of political strikes is still not settled in our country.  So whether they want it or not, all protesters and strike  organizers will violate the law. I would like to emphasize that  what we did not like about the political strike is the very  principle of resolving this issue. It boils down to the  following [word indistinct]. The government should resign, while  the Supreme Soviet sets a date for early elections and dissolves  itself.    Following this plan, we would end up with a caretaker  government, which is not legitimate, as a matter of fact. Of  course, there are no guarantees that this process will unfold in  a civilized way.    [Announcer] So, it is clear that the official trade unions  are going to (?find a common language) with the government in  the beginning of [words indistinct]. Asked about the political  role of the Federation in Belarus, its chairman said the  following.    [Hancharyk] We do not want to play any political role. Our  Statute limits our political activities to participating in the  elections. At present, however, it is impossible to solve  economic problems in isolation with the political ones.  Willy-nilly, trade unions cannot stay away from politics today.  [end recording]</p>

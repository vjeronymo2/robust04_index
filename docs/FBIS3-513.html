They were speaking after holding  talks in Mmabatho this evening.    Mr. Cronje quashed rumors that the Bophuthatswana government  is on the verge of collapse. He claimed that the situation in  the country was not as serious as it was portrayed in the media.  Earlier today chaos erupted in the capital as the strike reached  crisis levels. Estelle Pienaar reports on events outside the  capital:    [Pienaar] With the tension reaching fever pitch in Mmabatho,  the South African Defense Force [SADF] is on standby in nearby  Lichtenburg. A shopkeeper in the town told us that a contingent  of SADF trooops had arrived in the town during the day. We went  to investigate and found several Puma helicopters and a Dakota  aircraft at the aerodrome. Curious town folk had gathered in  the mealie fields surrounding the aerodrome to witness the  event. With the Bophuthatswana police and miitary still  staunchly supporting the Mangope government, and doing  everything in their power to put down the riotous crowds, the  SADF presence in the area might be a stern warning of what could  lie ahead for Bophuthatswana if peace and stability are not  restored soon.</p>

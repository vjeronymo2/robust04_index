			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: BTR sells stake in Pilkington A FLURRY of excitement gripped the London market yesterday afternoon, as word went round that international conglomerate BTR had sold its 4.1 per cent stake in Pilkington, one of the world's biggest glassmakers, for which it unsuccessfully bid in November 1986. After the market closed it was confirmed that BZW had bought the 31.2m shares for Pounds 50m, or 161p apiece. There were suggestions in the market, however, that only about 16.2m shares of the total had been placed at 162 1/2 p, with unconfirmed reports that around 11.2m had been pre-sold. One leading marketmaker was seen to have been an aggressive bidder for Pilkington stock in the dying minutes of the session, offering up to 166p a share. BTR closed 2 firmer at 495p, while Pilkington eased a penny to 163p. Fisons slips Pharmaceuticals group Fisons declined 10 to 369p ahead of today's annual meeting as French stockbroker Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull lowered its profits forecast for the company. Strauss analyst Mr Peter Laing said he had serious doubts over the fate of two Fisons products banned in the US last year after a dispute on production standards and methods. He doubted whether Opticrom, an eye allergy treatment, would get back in the US market as its US patent ends next year. He added that anaemia treatment Imferon could be overshadowed by a direct competitor developed in the US. Mr Laing shaved his 1992 estimate to between Pounds 220m and Pounds 225m from Pounds 240m and cut his 1993 forecast to Pounds 260m from Pounds 310m. Northern rises A buoyant food manufacturing sector was headed by Northern Foods, which surged 19 to 618p on the back of recommendations from two brokers. Nomura analyst Mr Carl Short was positive on the stock at the house morning meeting yesterday, citing Northern's recent underperformance and the proposed reform of the Milk Marketing Board as his reasons. County NatWest issued a large research note on the sector in which Northern was highlighted as one of several stocks forecast to outperform the market. Other food manufacturers were strong, with UBS Phillips &amp; Drew said to be short of stock. Bid talk fingering Hanson and Nestle as possible predators further lifted sentiment. Booker, also recommended by County, gained 24 to 474p, Cadbury-Schweppes 8 to 495p, Dalgety 13 to 435p and Unigate 15 to 353p. Troubled chemicals company MTM jumped 10 to 63p ahead of tomorrow's figures. Selected property issues were strong on press talk of further interest rate cuts this year. One analyst also said that some companies were indicating a slight rise in site valuations. British Land rose 7 to 201p, Hammerson Ordinary 19 to 428p and Land Securities 10 to 455p. Press reports that the fifth terminal at London's Heathrow airport will not be as expensive as previously expected pushed BAA up 8 to 653p, with analysts saying the company was unlikely to need a rights issue to finance the project. Associated British Ports was lifted 10 to 440p by a favourable annual meeting. Speculation that Lucas Industries was considering a rival bid for Dowty Group left the former off 6 at 147p. Dowty ended unaltered at 187p. There was caution ahead of today's figures from Marks and Spencer, with analysts nervous over the level of their sales forecasts for the stores group. The shares slipped 2 to 330p. Chunky volume in Asda - a further 15m shares were traded yesterday following last week's heavy turnover - did little to rid the market of takeover speculation, although most analysts were dismissive of the day's rumours. The stock added 2 3/4 at 31 1/2 p. Vague bid talk also surrounded Kwik Save, which rose 19 1/2 to 640p xd. Concern that US investment house Goldman Sachs might be having some difficulty getting away the whole of Hanson's 20m-share stake in ICI overshadowed the chemicals group, which slipped 8 to 1395p. Goldman bought the shares at 1400p each and was said to be offering them at 1410p. Conglomerate Hanson, which made Pounds 28m profit from the stake and is reckoned to be readying itself for another big bid, rose 5 to 243 1/2 p. However, analysts believe it is set to announce a fall in half-year profits of around 15 per cent to between Pounds 490m and Pounds 505m when it reports on Thursday. A report that US investment house Smith Barney had softened its enthusiasm for Glaxo held back the pharmaceuticals group on both sides of the Atlantic. In London, Glaxo closed a penny off at 776p. Smith Barney removed Glaxo from its short-term recommendation list, replacing it with Pfizer, which has had several new product launches lately, but kept it on its principal buy list. Reuters was firm after a presentation to analysts in Geneva last week. The company was enthusiastic on its new automated foreign exchange system Dealing 2000-2, and Hoare Govett reiterated its buy stance on the stock. The shares were 20 stronger before easing with the market to close 6 up at 1242p. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992 NEW HIGHS (455).

			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Wimpey pays Pounds 5m for Czech quarries interest GEORGE WIMPEY, the construction group, is acquiring a controlling interest in Severokamen, the previously state-owned quarry company in northern Bohemia in the Czech Republic. Wimpey is due to pay Pounds 5m cash, most of it during the next two years, to acquire a minimum stake of 50 per cent. It will also provide technical and management expertise. The 19 quarries being acquired are situated close to the German and Polish borders, providing opportunities for export. The price of aggregates in eastern Germany is about three times that in the Czech Republic. Mr Joe Dwyer, chief executive, said: 'This stake, on which we will build, represents a long term strategic investment bringing us low cost high quality reserves, excellent development potential and access to the future growth markets of central Europe. Wimpey-Severokamen, as the company will be renamed, produces more than 3m tonnes of mostly hard basalt rock a year, of which about 400,000 tonnes is expected to be exported to the rapidly growing eastern German construction market. The quarries account for between 55 and 60 per cent of the local market in northern Bohemia. The company has mining rights to estimated reserves of 520m tonnes of which 220m tonnes are at sites already being excavated. Wimpey initially will take a 34 per cent stake with the right to increase this to at least 50 per cent. It said that earnings from Severokamen were expected to at least cover the cost of finance in the first year.</p>

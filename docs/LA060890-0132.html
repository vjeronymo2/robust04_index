			<p><P> June 8, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRESS VOWS RETURN TO BROADCASTING AFTER LOSS  </P> <P> Former KABC-TV commentator and KABC-AM radio talk-show host Bill Press says he  will wait until the end of July at the earliest before returning to  broadcasting.  </P> <P> "My first priority is to spend some time with my family, pay some bills, then  go back to earning a living," said Press, defeated in his bid for the  Democratic nomination for insurance commissioner in Tuesday's primary election.  "I don't know where or how. I was not born for the corporate world or  consulting work. I was born to talk about issues and hope to do that again in  some form."  </P> <P> Press, who finished second to State Sen. John Garamendi (D-Walnut Grove), said  that his campaign owes between $50,000 and $100,000.  </P> <P> Although Press declined to say he would specifically be returning to KABC-TV  and KABC radio, there is precedent. Fellow commentator Bruce Herschensohn  returned to both stations after his failed 1986 campaign for the Republican  U.S. Senate nomination. Press had left both stations in 1987 to seek the 1988  Democratic nomination for U.S. Senator, withdrew before the primary and  rejoined both in 1988.  </P> <P> The bid for insurance commissioner was the first time that Press' name had  appeared on a ballot.  </P> <P> "The one great shock was (that) not until I ran did I realize how dependent in  today's politics candidates are on raising money," Press said. "I just deplore  the fact that we have to spend so much time raising money. The system is sick.  I come away from this experience more dedicated than ever to cleaning up this  political system and getting some serious limits on campaign spending and  campaign expenditures."  </P> <P> He believes his experiences as a candidate will be helpful when he resumes his  broadcasting career.  </P> <P> "All of us in journalism tend to get a little detached, by hiding behind our  cameras and computers," Press said. "It's good to get out there in the real  world and real people. I think I will come back to communicating ideas with a  much greater depth of understanding about people and what their problems, needs  and hopes are."  </P> <P> Press is not ruling out another run for office, but added that another campaign  was not in his current plans either. Press pledged to "do whatever I can" to  aid Garamendi in his general election bid against Republican insurance agent  Wes Bannister of Huntington Beach.  </P> <P> Press was critical of media coverage, especially by television, of the  insurance commissioner's race. Only fund-raising or negative television  commercials attracted media interest, he charged.  </P> <P> "Any time Walter Zelman (the former Common Cause executive director who  finished fourth in the Democratic primary) or I tried to talk about substantive  issues, like earthquake insurance or fraud, no one would show up," Press said.  "It was impossible to get attention to this race. This campaign was not the  media's finest hour."  </P></p>

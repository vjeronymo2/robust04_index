			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / Minister announces curb on investment by pension funds EMPLOYER-RELATED investment by occupational pension schemes will be limited from March 9 to 5 per cent of funds, the Department of Social Security announced yesterday. New regulations will also mean that self-investment below that level will have to be disclosed. A ceiling on self-investment was called for in the Social Security Act 1990. But it did not take effect because the government could not agree on how to define self-investment or where to impose a ceiling. The National Association of Pension Funds, the industry body, had urged a complete ban on employer-related investment by pension funds. The rules do not apply to small self-administered schemes with fewer than 12 members, or to employer-related investments in bank or building society accounts. The issue is controversial because pension funds have often invested in shares in the companies which employ their members and in assets owned by the companies. Thus, if the employing company collapsed, workers might lose much of their pensions as well as their jobs. The rules announced yesterday will not force pension funds to sell property they own which is used by the employer. However, if such property already exceeds 5 per cent of all investments, they will not be able to buy more. The rules bar investment in the employing company an loans or securities issued to or by 'any person who is connected with, or an associate of, the employer.' However, Mr Tony Newton, social security secretary, rejected a request from the Occupational Pensions Board to define more clearly who is a connected or associated person or company. It is not clear whether some of the investments made by the late Robert Maxwell's pension funds in companies in which Maxwell was building a personal stake would have fallen foul of the new rules.

			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / GDP figure helps lift recession gloom WEST GERMANY'S gross domestic product for the second quarter of this year was unchanged compared with the first three months, fuelling hopes that the recession has finally bottomed out. Latest statistics from the federal Economics Ministry showed that the decline in GDP over the four previous quarters had been stemmed in the second quarter. During the first three months of this year it fell by 1.5 per cent from the previous quarter, or 3.2 per cent over the same period last year. However, the Berlin-based German Institute for Economic Forecasting (DIW) yesterday dampened expectations for growth in the third quarter. It predicted that the economy would stay flat largely because rising unemployment was curtailing private consumption. It predicted that GDP for 1993 would decline by 2 per cent. The two reports coincide with the release of official statistics on sales for the manufacturing and mining industry for the first half of the year. They show a fall of 8 per cent, to DM942.7bn (Pounds 377bn), compared to the same period a year ago, while exports, which totalled DM246.9bn, declined by 9 per cent. However, both the ministry and the DIW are cautiously optimistic about growth in eastern Germany. DIW expects GDP to grow by 5 per cent this year in the five eastern Lander. It rose 6.3 per cent in the second quarter, compared to 3.9 per cent in the previous three months. However, such growth is coming from a very low base. East German GDP contracted by 31.4 per cent in 1991, when the economy collapsed following monetary union, which exposed the region's lack of competitiveness, and the subsequent loss of industry's markets in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. GDP growth in 1992 was 6.8 per cent. Much of the growth in eastern Germany remains concentrated on the construction industry and services.</p>

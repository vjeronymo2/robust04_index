			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / Disciplinarian with a vision: Yasushi Mieno, Bank of Japan governor, talks to Richard Lambert and Charles Leadbeater The calm at the Bank of Japan's imposing headquarters in Tokyo, one of only a handful of buildings in the city which survived the 1923 earthquake, was unruffled on Friday afternoon by the tumultuous events unfolding in the Japanese parliament. As the Japanese government watched its authority slip away, Mr Yasushi Mieno, the bank's redoubtable governor, was unperturbed. Mr Mieno, who became governor in late 1989, is far more than a central banker. He is a fiercely, skilfully independent figure who inspires loyalty among his staff, commands respect from his peers and provokes anger among many politicians who believe he should be their servant. The Bank of Japan's formal independence from the finance ministry and its political masters is limited, but Mr Mieno has won more autonomy for the bank than any recent governor. Yet the 69-year-old governor is not a dry technocrat. His views on the role of monetary policy are spiced with reflections upon everyday life. Mr Mieno has a vision of Japan that stretches beyond economics into the nation's moral and social wellbeing. That clarity of purpose will be particularly important in the next few months as Japan enters a period of political instability and uncertainty, ushered in by the government's defeat on Friday in a no-confidence vote. The general election on July 18 is widely expected to leave the country with a weak and unstable government. Amid the uncertainty, Mr Mieno's authority will be vital to lend stability to economic policy. The political upheaval has come at a time when the economy is 'in a very delicate stage', Mr Mieno says, after a two-year downturn from the high growth of the late 1980s. The length and profound adjustment may be nearing its end, he indicated. 'Starting from the latter half of 1993 we can expect the economy will start recovering, although it will be mild,' he explained. The government's pump priming measures, worth about Y24,000bn since last August, combined with interest rates at a historic low of 2.5 per cent, should support the economy, Mr Mieno believes, while the 'foundations for private autonomous recovery in the latter half of fiscal year 1993 are steadily being prepared'. This autonomous recovery in personal consumption and capital investment should be underpinned by the improving health of the Japanese banking system. The main Japanese banks are heavily burdened by bad debts, the aftermath of the collapse of the speculative property market of the late 1980s. Mr Mieno believes the banks are sorting out their problems by cutting costs, aggressively writing off bad loans and rebuilding their weakened balance sheets. Yet he is careful not to overstate the banks' progress: 'It is steady and good, in the right direction, but I would not say it was very bold.' The main danger is the deflationary impact of the yen's rapid appreciation against the dollar. The yen rose from about Y125 to the dollar at the turn of the year to about Y105 early last week. The political crisis is expected to pull the yen back to at least Y110. Mr Mieno said he would 'keep a close watch on the deflationary impact of the strong yen'. Yet the yen's strength will be only one factor he will take into account in deciding whether to cut interest rates again, as many Tokyo financial analysts expect him to. The yen's rise has complicated the bank's main mission, which Mr Mieno said was to 'stabilise the value of the currency and stabilise the financial system'. He went on: 'Generally speaking, when there is a sharp fluctuation in the value of the currency by a sharp deflation or inflation, at the same time it is very difficult to keep a sound financial system.' Mr Mieno won his reputation as a disciplinarian by raising interest rates four times to 6 per cent in the 10 months after he become governor, to deflate the speculative bubble economy of the late 1980s. Yet he was closely involved in the bank's earlier decision to keep interest rates at 2.5 per cent for more than two years from February 1987, which help to inflate the bubble. This laxity is now the cause for contrition: 'I regret that we did not act much faster. We kept our interest rates low for a long period of time.' The mistakes which led to the bubble have left a deep scar upon Japan's elite of economic bureaucrats. Mr Mieno is no exception, believing that the bubble was not just an economic problem for Japan, but also a threat to its moral fibre. He explained: 'The bubble taught us the dreadfulness of the speculative economy.' The awfulness of economic excess was matched by a social danger: speculation threatened to undermine the work ethic and Japan's relatively egalitarian distribution of income. Mr Mieno said: 'The bubble hurt the soundness and stability of Japanese society. The efforts of labour which is to work with sweat on your forehead has been weakened. Morale was reduced and there was unfairness in the distribution of wealth.' With the bubble's painful lessons learnt, Mr Mieno is optimistic about the economy's long-term potential as long as Japan plays to its strengths. He said: 'In the postwar era three factors contributed to Japan's economic growth: high levels of saving, a hard working attitude and great entrepreneurship.' To foster the latter quality in particular Mr Mieno believes further deregulation is required, a theme that the governor believes should guide Japan's response to US demands for a cut in the Japanese trade surplus which is expected to reach Dollars 150bn this year. 'First, we should keep our economy on a non-inflationary stable path and second we should deregulate and reconsider our trading practices to open up our market further,' he said. As far as economic stimulus to boost demand for imports is concerned, Mr Mieno said: 'We have already done what we can on the economy.' He added that the trade imbalance with the US mainly resulted from Japan's high savings, which constrained consumption and demand for imports. Mr Mieno warned that Japan and its trading partners would pay a high price if Japan tried to cut the surplus rapidly through stimulating its economy: 'That will certainly create inflation and would not be good for the Japanese economy or for the stable growth of the world economy.' The alternative was further structural reform to 'heighten the transparency of our market and our economic system', he said. Mr Mieno does not underestimate the scale of the challenge facing the Japanese economy. 'The Japanese economy is facing a task which we have not experienced before, factors such as a sharp increase in the old-age population, changes in working habits and the after-effects of the bubble. All these could restrict the growth of the Japanese economy,' he noted. Yet Mr Mieno is undaunted: his sense of discipline is the source of his confidence. Mr Mieno's generation believes the austerity it underwent amid the poverty after the second world war was the foundation for the high growth that followed in the 1950s and 1960s. In Japan low inflation can be delivered without high unemployment and low growth, Mr Mineo believes. So the suggestion that the Japanese economy may grow more slowly in the future provokes a sweeping dismissal: it would be tantamount to failure. Mr Mieno concluded: 'I am rather optimistic for the longer term. The idea that we should learn to live under low economic growth is a pathetic notion.'</p>

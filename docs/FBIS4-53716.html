			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 20 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean  Government has changed a policy and now decided to allow the  imports of codfish heads as a food, Yi Ui-su, administrator of  the Fisheries Administration said on Friday. Yi told reporters  that there no longer is any ground to ban the imports of codfish  heads.    Noting that the United States has consistently been asking  for their imports, the administrator said, "We have decided to  permit codfish head imports especially because the United States  threatens to take a trade retaliation based on Super Article  301."    Yi said that early last March three food hygienic experts  were sent to the United States to inspect codfish head  processing. "We have determined there is no problem so far as  hygienic matters are concerned," he said.    Imports of codfish heads, he said, could be made beginning  some time in the first half of next year at the earliest because  of the time needed in fixing domestic regulations in both  countries to facilitate the exports and imports of the item.    Thirteen tons and 1,013 tons of American codfish heads were  imported in 1983 and 1984 before their introduction was halted  altogether in the face of public uproars that the imports of  discarded American codfish heads as a food were prone to hurt  people's health and national prestige.</p>

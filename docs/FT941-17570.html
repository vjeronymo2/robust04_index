			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / Bosnian premier to meet with Croatian foreign minister in Vienna Mr Haris Silajdzic, the Bosnian prime minister, is due to meet Mr Mate Granic, the Croatian foreign minister, in Vienna today in an effort to restart talks on the partition of Bosnia, writes Laura Silber. The two men will discuss territorial disputes and humanitarian issues. Their meeting follows threats by Croatian President Franjo Tudjman and other senior officials to intervene unless the mainly Moslem Bosnian army halts an offensive in central Bosnia. With peace talks stalled, the Bosnian army launched an offensive against Croat forces to gain control over most of the central part of the republic. All-party talks are set to resume in Geneva later this month after the unsuccessful attempt to broker a pre-Christmas agreement.</p>

			<p><P> November 14, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> FATHER HELD IN TWO FIRES AT DAUGHTER'S PRESCHOOL  </P> <P> The father of a Clairemont preschooler was arrested Tuesday on suspicion of  setting two pre-dawn fires at his child's school in the past week, fire  authorities said.  </P> <P> Authorities would not disclose the motive behind the alleged actions, but said  the man was arrested at Metro Arson Strike Team headquarters after being taken  there for questioning.  </P> <P> Kirt Raft, 27, was booked into County Jail on suspicion of two counts of arson,  Metro Arson Strike Team Capt. Jim Smidt said.  </P> <P> The Wee Care Preschool was scheduled to reopen Tuesday in its new location next  door to the original school at 3580 Mt. Acadia Blvd., Smidt said. An arson fire  Friday shut the school, and school officials spent the long holiday weekend  moving into the new classrooms, he said.  </P> <P> However, a second blaze Tuesday morning at 3578 Mt. Arcadia, squelched the  reopening plans. Firefighters were called to the school about 4:15 a.m. and  brought the blaze under control by 4:34 a.m., Smidt said.  </P> <P> The cause of Tuesday's fire was still under investigation, Smidt said. Smoke  and fire damage was estimated at $150,000, he said.  </P> <P> Flammable liquid was used to start Friday's fire, which caused about $40,000  damage to several classrooms in the two-story wood-and-stucco building, Smidt  said. It took 41 firefighters about half an hour to contain that blaze, which  broke out at 3:30 a.m., he said.  </P> <P> One firefighter suffered minor injuries battling last week's blaze, but did not  require hospitalization, Smidt said. Separate businesses situated on the second  floor of the building also sustained smoke damage.  </P> <P> About 60 children attend the preschool, which has been in business at the Mt.  Acadia address for eight years.  </P></p>

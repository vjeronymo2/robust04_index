			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / Tajikistan PM accuses Kabul TAJIKISTAN'S prime minister, Mr Abdulmalik Abdulajanov, yesterday accused the leadership of neighbouring Afghanistan of being behind last week's attack by opposition fighters on Russian border guards, Reuter reports from Moscow. 'Commanders of the 55th division of Afghanistan's regular army took part in the attack and one can hardly imagine that Kabul knew nothing about it,' Mr Abdulajanov said. Tajik rebels attacked a border post, guarded jointly by Russian and Tajik servicemen, from Afghan territory on July 13. In the 24-hour battle that followed 25 border guards and more than 100 civilians were killed. Kabul has since accused Russian troops of making a retaliatory artillery strike on the border areas of Afghanistan and killing more than 350 people.</p>

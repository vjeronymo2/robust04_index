			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Minister of Coordination and Planning Enzo </F> del Bufalo by Alfredo Carquez Saavedra; place and date not given]    [Text] The following are some of the most important  macroeconomic indices the administration of President Caldera  hopes to achieve between 1994 and 1995:    --Average interest rates of 45 percent in 1994, and 35  percent in 1995.    --Price increases of 35 percent, at a maximum, in the first  year, and 28 percent, at a maximum, in the second year.    --Economic growth of 1.5 and 2.5 percent, for the respective  years.    --Negative fiscal deficits of 2.9 and 1.5 percent, for the  respective years.    However, a large part of the hope of achieving these, or  even  better, goals depends on the series of sectorial agreements the  government has decided to promote.    Enzo del Bufalo, who heads the CORDIPLAN [Office of  Coordination and Planning], says that this is not a matter of a  disagreement. "It is, instead, a negotiation of an almost  mercantile sort between the government and some of the economic  actors. There is a chain in which macroeconomic problems and  microeconomic actions are intermingled, and they will be  discussed by those who have to deal with them. Because what the  one provides not only benefits both parties, but also gives rise  to positive effects for the other participants. For example, if  the executive branch eliminates the fiscal deficit, this will  allow the Central Bank of Venezuela to alter the monetary  policy."    [Saavedra] Would this mean elimination of the zero coupon  bonds?    [Del Bufalo] Among other things, there would be no reason to  issue more zero coupons. It will then be able to finance a plan  to improve the solvency of the financial system, instead of  using the resources as is being done now, because the present  monetary policy is a residual policy. In other words, this  institution simply finds itself faced with an economic policy  being pursued for its own sake.    But if the executive branch eliminates the deficit, the  pressure to effect a possible devaluation for fiscal reasons  will disappear. And this also sets aside one of the reasons for  the purchase of dollars. Nor would there be a need to impose  high interest rates.    [Saavedra] What contributions would the business sector have  to make?    [Del Bufalo] Two specific things will be asked of it in this  negotiation. The first is at least partial absorption of the  impact of inflation. This means refraining from passing on the  increase in costs to the final prices, so that inertial  inflation is eliminated. The other thing that will be required  is that the reactivation of production be initiated. All of this  would contribute to a change in what will be received as a  benefit--a very low real interest rate.    [Saavedra] And what will the workers be asked to do? To  moderate their wage demands?    [Del Bufalo] What can be required of the workers is  something  very concrete--that they be ready for a change in the social  welfare system to a different mode--one better adapted to the  enterprises, in exchange for receiving an increase in real wages.    [Saavedra] Is there some concrete proposal in this regard?    [Del Bufalo] There are various proposals. But the idea is  not  for the government to impose them, but for the workers to  negotiate them to their full satisfaction. The executive branch  will serve only as an intermediary. What we will contribute  directly in this connection, however, is a real offer to create  an entire overall social security system.    [Saavedra] What will happen to the accumulated social  allocations?    [Del Bufalo] They represent an acquired right. What could be  done is to pay off those who want to change the system they use.    [Saavedra] When will the negotiations begin?    [Del Bufalo] When the preliminary talks in which we are  engaged with the interested parties have been concluded. I  believe that this will actually occur within two or three weeks,  at the latest.    [Saavedra] What leads you to believe that progress will be  made with these agreements?    [Del Bufalo] These agreements have strictly economic goals.  It is neither a question of supporting nor of opposing the  government. What is intended is to stabilize five variable  economic factors.    [Saavedra] Is it your belief that this represents not only  the last chance, but also the only possible formula?    [Del Bufalo] This is the only way to proceed at a low social  cost. And if Venezuela wants to avoid more suffering, this is  the formula that will ensure less suffering. Because this  alternative has the advantage of requiring no sacrifice in  addition to those we have undergone, and it translates into  direct benefits for each of the participants within a very short  time.    Now, if the economic sectors in Venezuela are not able to  negotiate an agreement that makes it possible to stabilize the  economic variables while at the same time obtaining net profits,  we will have to have recourse to the traditional mechanisms.  These are the mechanisms of the classic type that lead to  foreign-exchange and price controls, resulting in a slowing of  the structural change in the economy, without any certainty that  it will proceed in the long run. Or, there are those of a  neoliberal sort that mean drastic devaluation with high interest  rates. This would also slow the growth of the economy and would  cause the population more pain.    [Saavedra] Is it true that the executive branch has  considered avoiding the use of foreign financing for 1994 and  1995?    [Del Bufalo] An effort will be made to avoid any increase in  the debt. But a maximum indebtedness level for 1994 has already  been approved in the national budget, and a comparable debt  ceiling for 1995 is being analyzed.    [Saavedra] What is the amount of each of these figures?    [Del Bufalo] That for this year comes to approximately  275.455 billion bolivares, and that for 1995 to about 140  billion bolivares. However, the figure for 1994 represents the  maximum for the fiscal deficit, which we hope will come to no  more than 2.9 percent of the gross domestic product.    [Saavedra] But is the government fearful of using foreign  financing, or is this regarded as just another tool?    [Del Bufalo] What we have is a policy of avoiding any  increase in the net indebtedness. However, payments on the  debts, as well as the contracting of others, will continue. The  strategy of reducing indebtedness involves trying to reduce, to  a minimum, the financing of expenditures through the use of this  tool.    [Saavedra] Is it true that the executive branch is going to  propose an amendment to the Privatization Law that would limit  the use of the funds obtained by this means exclusively to the  reduction of the foreign debt?    [Del Bufalo] A proposal that the privatization resources be  used only to pay off debts and to invest in new assets has been  put forth, and it seems a very sensible one to me. The problem  is that rather than slowing privatization pending the passage of  a new law, it would be better to continue working with the norms  we have now, because the privatization program must be carried  out with a certain speed.</p>

			<p><P> April 7, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SUSPECT WALKS AWAY FROM HOSPITAL  </P> <P> A prisoner being treated Friday at Mercy Hospital walked away from custody,  apparently after a private security guard unhooked the man's chains, sheriff's  officials said.  </P> <P> Richard Robledo, 34, of Cerritos, who was arrested on suspicion of felony  hit-and-run driving and evading arrest, walked out of the hospital about 2:30  p.m. and was still missing Friday night.  </P> <P> Sgt. Roy Stamper of the Sheriff's Department said Robledo was injured in a  traffic accident after a high-speed chase. He was taken to the hospital and  placed under the watch of a security guard for the Holmes Security Co.  </P> <P> Stamper said the private company contracts with the county to provide hospital  protection. The guard apparently unchained the prisoner against regulations,  and Robledo slipped away unnoticed through a door adjoining the shower,  officials said.  </P> <P> The escapee was described as white, 5-foot-9, 170 pounds, with blond hair and  hazel eyes. "He was wearing hospital garb when he left," Stamper said.  </P></p>

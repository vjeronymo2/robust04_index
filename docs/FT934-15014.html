			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / Polls show people losing faith in leading German political parties Germany's leading political parties have all lost substantial support in the opinion polls over the past two months, with a significant rise in the popularity of all the fringe protest groups, writes Quentin Peel. The Christian Democratic Union, and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union, would get only 30.9 per cent support if there were an election this week, according to the latest poll by the Allensbach Institute. At the last general election in December, 1990, the parties won 43.8 per cent. The Social Democrats are down to 35.4 per cent, compared with 38.2 per cent in the west and 34.8 per cent in the east. The principal beneficiaries have been the Greens, up to 12.1 per cent, and the far right Republicans, up to 5.6 per cent, enough to gain them seats in the Bundestag.</p>

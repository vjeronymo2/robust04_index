Israeli officials leaked information alleging that they had  disarmed just two settlers. But there are some 150,000 heavily  armed Jewish settlers, who do not even try to conceal their  determination to continue the murders, destruction, and  massacres. Thus we see the true extent of the Israeli officials'  deception and their disregard for the international community.    In fact, Israeli officials' eagerness to resume the  suspended  talks with the Palestinians is due to their fear for the Oslo  and Cairo agreements, which have practically given Israel a free  hand in the occupied Arab territories affairs and entrenched  total Zionist hegemony. While both agreements stipulate  security arrangements and an Israeli military deployment, they  do not, in return, include any arrangement for the protection of  the Palestinian people from attacks by the settlers and the  Israeli Army.    Israeli officials are also concerned over the growth of the  Palestinian intifadah throughout the occupied territories. This  threatens both agreements with collapse and sheds light on the  main problem represented by occupation, settlement, and Israel's  refusal to apply Security Council resolutions organizing the  peace process. By trying to revive the negotiations, the Israeli  officials want to deceive the international community and to  prevent the Security Council from passing a resolution stressing  the bases of a just and comprehensive peace in the region,  condemning the settlement policy, calling for the dismantling of  the settlements, and providing protection for the Palestinian  people.    Israel's calls for peace do not stand up to any test. It is  Israel that occupies the Arab territories, refuses to withdraw  from them, commits crimes, instigates the settlers to commit  massacres, arms and finances settlers, and prevents the  Washington talks from advancing a single step. Over two years  of talks, the Arab delegations have heard nothing other than  Israeli security pretexts and conditions, while Arabs in the  West Bank, Gaza Strip, and southern Lebanon fell victims. It is  the Arab side that certainly needs security guarantees. The  terrible Hebron massacre exposed Israel's hypocrisy and  allegations, which are aimed at preventing the application of  the Security Council's resolutions and the return of the  occupied territories to their rightful owners.    Israel's call on Syria to declare its commitment to  achieving  a just and comprehensive peace gives a clear idea of Israel's  hypocrisy. Syria has announced such a commitment hundreds of  times through President al-Asad, it has repeatedly saved the  Washington talks from collapse, and it has called for true peace  in the Middle East that can survive in the face of events and  variables. But Israel lent a deaf ear to these calls and  focused all its efforts on how to blackmail the Palestinian side  and to push it into a unilateral settlement that does not meet  the aspirations of the Palestinian people and the requirements  of the desired peace in the region. How quickly the snow melted  and Israel's peace concepts were exposed! Israel wants to kill  the Palestinian people by raking them with machine guns and  rockets, all under the pretext of security allegations.    The Security Council, which is continuing its consultations  on the Hebron massacre, must live up to the principles of the  United Nations and the credibility of the international  community in order to clarify matters, to condemn the settlement  process in terms of politics and application, and to clearly  call for Israel's total withdrawal as a basic conditions for a  stable peace in the Middle East.</p>

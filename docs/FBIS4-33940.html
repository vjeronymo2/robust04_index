			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Lucia Helena Gazzola] </F>   [Text] Sao Paulo, 9 Jun (AE) -- PT [Workers Party]  presidential candidate Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva today released  the first major project of his campaign: "More and better jobs  for Brazilians." The project, providing for the creation of  more than 8 million jobs over the 1995-98 period, assumes that  "the central axis of the policy for reactivating jobs will be  expanding the level of investment in the Brazilian economy,  which in 1993 was 16 percent of GDP, to approximately 25  percent." During an interview, Lula and project coordinator  Aloizio Mercadante admitted what the text of the project says in  its final part: The private sector will have to create "the  bulk" of the new jobs.    "The private sector will have to make the bulk of  investments, although I cannot specify the percentage of such  investments," Mercadante said, adding that this will be possible  only if the government creates the appropriate conditions. "If  the government promotes development and reactivates growth, if  it guarantees financial resources, and if it ends financial  speculation, private investment will grow and will go to the  productive sector," he said. Lula gave vague answers when asked  whether there will be money for the project. "If there is no  money, we will have to create it; we will make great efforts  with the private sector, and will negotiate with entrepreneurs  for a year to have them to join the National Solidarity Fund to  be created in 1996 to promote the project, reminding them that  the richest brackets are responsible for the recuperation of  Brazil," he said.    For the "urgent" creation of jobs, the project provides for  the implementation of a basic sanitation program (from 250,000  to 375,000 new jobs), the repair and construction of 25,000 km  of urban highways (70,000 jobs), the construction of storage  facilities with 6 million tons' capacity (70,000), a  "revolutionary" education program (300,000), the recovery of Sao  Paulo and Rio de Janeiro hospital beds (36,000), land reform  (1,100,000), credits for investment in small estates  (2,160,000), expansion of farm production (150,000), plus  500,000 jobs in urban areas caused by an annual 4 percent growth  of farm production, 500,000 to 1 million new jobs created by  increased production of small and mid-sized agricultural  industries in the interior, investment in tourism (120,000),  highway network maintenance (90,000), and a housing program  (411,000). The PT also will encourage the creation of  cooperatives, micro and small-sized enterprises, entrepreneurial  partnerships, "enterprise nurseries," and the reduction of the  work week to allow for the creation of new jobs.    "The task of creating jobs will be mostly a private sector  responsibility," the project text says, noting that the state  will implement a development policy that will encourage the  creation of new jobs. To this end the PT claims that it is  essential to expand the offer of credits for productive  investment. "This will call for a comprehensive reform of the  financial system, to end financial speculation." Among the  sources of funds, the project mentions the FTGS [Severance Pay  Fund] ($4 billion annually), the Fund for Protection of Workers  ($5 billion annually), constitutional funds ($1 billion), the  Social Development Fund, the National Education Development  Fund, the PIS/PASEP [Social Integration Program/Government  Employee Welfare Fund], and official development agencies and  banks.    The project provides for the creation of two other funds:  the  National Solidarity Fund (made up of budget funds and the taxes  on big fortunes), and the Productive Restructuring Fund. Lula  said he also counts on foreign investment.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by D.G.: "Parliament Wishes to Support European </F> Electronics"]    [Text] To avoid European dependence on others in the field  of electronics (the term "electronics" is used here to cover  electronics for the general public, components, measures,  manufacturers, telecommunications, information technology and  office technology, automation, and software), the European  Parliament has asked the Commission to improve its support for  this sector of European industry. In the report, a company is  considered to be European if it manufactures, undertakes  research and development in Europe, and makes decisions  concerning the above two activities in Europe.    Through its 18 January resolution, the European Parliament  gives its unconditional support to Europe's electronics  industry. The draft resolution is submitted by the European  Parliament to the Commission. It is a statement of intent,  which the Commission may use. However, the Parliament is only  consulted over electronics -- it is not party to decisionmaking.  It thus calls upon the Commission to use all the means at its  disposal to assist European electronics exports to Japan and the  United States. In particular, in view of the difficulties in  penetrating the U.S. and Japanese public markets, the European  Parliament suggests "systematically including a reciprocity rule  in Community legislation" so as to offset the lack of European  protectionism in public markets. In the same spirit, it asks  the Commission to negotiate fair competition with the European  Union's trading partners, including stabilization of currencies  and exchange rates, in addition to respect for the rules of the  International Labor Office, and for international regulations  over the environment.    The Parliament also invites the Commission to work with the  Council of the European Union to draft two notices before 1  January 1995. The first notice will apparently concern the  conclusion of "agreements similar to the U.S.-Japanese agreement  on semiconductors," or of "an `electronic' agreement similar to  the `automobile' agreement with Japan." The second notice seems  likely to concern the establishment of Community protection  measures.    Regarding components, so as to avoid dependence on a single  non-European manufacturer, the Parliament's "statement of cause"  (the "statement of cause" explains the reasons for the draft  resolution; the resolution is what has been adopted by the  European Parliament) suggests the establishment of a European  participation fund to finance a part of the research dedicated  to commercial purposes. This would enable "the strengthening of  the technological and financial base of the European electronics  industry."    In practical terms, through its draft resolution the  European  Parliament also demands aid for "cooperation over research and  development for precompetitive and competitive innovations." It  also asks the Commission to "strengthen and accelerate  technological research efforts undertaken under the European  research framework programs, and under the EUREKA initiative",  and to give legal and financial assistance for "reconstruction  and rationalization initiatives emanating from the private  sector and aiming to improve adaptation to the global market."  It gives its support to the possibility of creating European  trusts capable of competing with the American, Japanese, and  South Korean giants by insisting that the Commission should  authorize mergers and cooperation whenever necessary for the  survival of the European industry. In the same spirit, it calls  for harmonization of technical standards, taking the GSM  standard as an example.    Furthermore, it insists that the European Union should  maintain "expertise in the development and implementation of  pan-European networks for the exchange of data, so as to ensure  its interoperability."</p>

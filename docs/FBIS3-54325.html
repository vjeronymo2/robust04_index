A detailed plan presented by ECO's transportation ministers  in Almaty last November is becoming operational now.    As Azerbaijan republic and the Central Asian states joined  ECO in 1992 following their independence from Soviet rule, the  organization has taken big strides in an effort to cooperate  with other international organizations.    Afghan Foreign Minister Arsala proposed that ECO establish a  center for surface transport and transit between member states.    Foreign minister of the Republic of Azerbaijan Gasan Gasanov  said the joining of the seven new regional countries to the  organization makes it all the more capable. He said mutual  trust among members was necessary to promote the business ties  within the ECO.    Turkish Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin said his government  attaches special importance to relations with neighboring  countries, while the Foreign Minister of Kazakhstan, Tuleutai I.  Suleymenov, proposed the formation of a mercantile development  bank of member states this year.    The Kazakh foreign minister said his country is to embark on  its national development plans this year and looks forward to  closer cooperation with ECO.    The Kyrgyz official to the fourth ECO foreign ministerial  which opened this morning, said his country was keen on  supplying member states with electricity.    The total power generation in Kyrgyzstan totals 143 billion  kilowatts per hour, which he said, is a mere 10 per cent of the  vast potential of the country.    Tajikistan Foreign Minister Aliyev for his part favoured the  setting up of an ECO financial body and said his country will  study the suggestions made at the session.    Pakistani Foreign Ministry representative, Najmuddin Shaikh,  called for strengthening of infrastructural projects in member  states.    The session was also attended by Uzbekistan Foreign Minister  Asymov and Turkmenistan Deputy President Shikhmuradov.</p>

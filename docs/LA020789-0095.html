			<p><P> February 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHICAGO BOARD OF TRADE PLANS OWN ELECTRONIC TRADING SYSTEM  </P> <P> The Chicago Board of Trade is developing an electronic trading system, a move  that may have been nudged ahead by the government's two-year investigation into  fraud in futures trading, sources at the exchange said Monday.  </P> <P> The CBT, the world's largest futures exchange, is looking at a system which  would compete with Globex, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's after-hours  electronic trading system that won federal approval last week.  </P> <P> Called Computerized Trade Reconstruction, the new computer system may modify  the CBT's existing one -- which tracks and records all transactions in the  trading pits -- by allowing the exchange to reconstitute trades when disputes  arise.  </P> <P> The FBI probe may have catalyzed the CBT's decision to approve funding for the  electronic trading system, the unidentified sources said. The system will be  unveiled at the Futures Industry Assn. meeting in Boca Raton, Fla., next month.  </P> <P> The government probe, in which undercover agents from the Federal Bureau of  Investigation posed as traders and allegedly found widespread trading abuses at  the CBT and Mercantile Exchange, has focused attention on the way both  exchanges do business.  </P> <P> Futures trades are currently executed by the "open-outcry" system, in which  traders shout and flash hand signals in noisy, chaotic pits on the floor of the  exchanges. A future is a contract to buy or sell a commodity -- ranging from  soybeans to currency -- at a future date at an agreed-upon price.  </P> <P> The Mercantile Exchange, called the Merc, said Globex is not designed to  replace present trading methods, but will link the exchange to others around  the world when the Merc's trading day is over. The Merc, the world's second  largest futures exchange, developed Globex with Reuters Holdings PLC.  </P> <P> The CBT has publicly criticized computerized systems in the past, praising the  open-outcry system instead. The exchange's board of directors is scheduled to  meet today to recommend changes in trading procedures. The directors will  discuss 24-hour trading using after-hours trading systems, while proposals for  trading changes will be presented to exchange members next week, according to a  notice to members circulated on the trading floor.  </P> <P> Monday's memo at the exchange did not elaborate whether the meeting proposals  would involve computerized trading. An exchange spokesman declined comment.  </P> <P> Sources at the exchange said they expected CBT directors to pressure the  membership into approving some type of extended trading to compete with the  Merc. In the past, the CBT has relied on expanded trading hours at home, rather  than electronic trading, to tap overseas and particularly Far Eastern interest.  </P> <P> Two years ago, the CBT introduced an evening session that extended its day by 3  1/2 hours, leaving a gap of equal length between day and night trading. The  exchange has discussed other ways to lengthen the trading day, but it has moved  slowly toward implementing such measures until now.  </P> <P> According to the sources, the Board of Trade is working on computerized trading  with computer/electronics firms such as Tandy Corp. and Apple Computer Inc. The  Board of Trade has already developed a pilot electronic system to speed up the  delivery of brokerage house orders to the side of the trading pits.  </P> <P> The Justice Department has not confirmed the existence of the undercover  investigation at the two exchanges. But a source familiar with the probe told  Reuters that up to 150 indictments may be handed up in the case, perhaps later  this month.  </P></p>

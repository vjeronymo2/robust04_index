			<p><P> May 18, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A VEGAS GOODBY;  </P> <P> PRAISE FOR SAMMY DAVIS JR. IS EXTRAVAGANT IN THE CITY WHERE HE ADORNED MARQUEES  </P> <P> Claude Trenier could not contain himself. Even before the gold lame curtain  lifted over the stage of the Sinbad Lounge in the Aladdin Casino, the  70-year-old entertainer delivered the announcement that almost every act in  town would make before the long desert night ended.  </P> <P> "We'd like to dedicate this show," he barked, "to a great showman who will  surely be missed!"  </P> <P> It was the night that Sammy Davis Jr. died, and Las Vegas, an outsized place  where gambling halls are transformed into castles and praise swells into  adoration, was awash in an effervescence of tribute. In darkened lounges and  club rooms up and down the Strip, the luckless and the eternal optimists of  this gambling capital paid fealty to "Mr. Entertainment," each in his or her  own grandiose fashion.  </P> <P> Middle-aged gamblers who once envied Davis and his Rat Pack pals as the  embodiments of eternal finger-snapping nonchalance paused to mull their  generation's approaching mortality. Chorus-line dancers and hotel maids grew  teary-eyed, recalling Davis' words of encouragement -- and the cases of Dom  Perignon he sometimes sent to chase the words down. Even inside the drab office  corridors hidden away from the neon-lit caverns of slot machines, casino  officials turned away -- however briefly -- from their counting books to voice  their respects.  </P> <P> "Hey, man, it's worth it," explained Claude Trenier as he took the stage.  "We're talking about Sammy."  </P> <P> When the curtain lifted, Trenier was not quite the dynamo of four decades ago  on what he described as the chitlin circuit. In his prime, he and his four  brothers would turn hardwood stages into trampolines with their frenetic  song-and-dance act.  </P> <P> But as Trenier -- who said he knew Davis well -- negotiated his creaky  soft-shoe routine, he and his group honored the entertainer the way any  seasoned lounge act would honor a fallen star. They honored him often.  </P> <P> "We lost one of our great friends today!" he reminded his audience as the  Treniers worked their way through the "Sheik of Araby."  </P> <P> "We lost a dear friend today," he noted before performing "Hava Nagila."  </P> <P> And on it went as they sang and danced and paid homage through a collection of  the sort of standards that Davis did so well.  </P> <P> The part of this town that was Davis' struts its stuff at night, and during the  day of his death the tributes were somewhat muted. Casino marquees bore no  mention of his passing, frozen in their usual promotions of performing  chimpanzees and army-sized chorus lines.  </P> <P> As night approached, however, the casino chieftains collectively declared a  tribute that only Las Vegas could announce -- plans to darken all the marquees  for 10 minutes tonight, the first time that the massive neon billboards will  dim since the death of President John F. Kennedy.  </P> <P> At Bally's, orders went out to move a framed portrait of Davis from its honored  place in the hotel-casino's Celebrity Room -- where it hangs with photographs  of Rat Pack buddies Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin and other stars who have played  the showroom -- to a prominent place at the casino's front entrance.  </P> <P> "Remember to get some flowers with it," hotel publicist Tom Bruny told an  assistant.  </P> <P> Karen Nelson Bell, 46, a titian-haired piano player, did her part to make sure  casino visitors knew just whose day it was. Seated serenely at an ebony piano,  Bell played Davis' most popular hits, reproducing "Candyman" and "Mr.  Bojangles" in endless rippling glissandos.  </P> <P> After playing a medley requested by a Davis fan, Bell said she had "tried to  make it as exquisitely tender as I could. Each of us ought to thank that man  for the joy he brought to this city. We all knew he was ill, but I kept  thinking that somehow, he'd go on forever."  </P> <P> In the casino's penthouse, 26 floors up, hotel maid Maria Sudbury, 62,  repeatedly removed a crumpled slip of paper from her apron pocket, read it and  stuffed it away.  </P> <P> Sudbury, a Belgian native who has worked nearly 20 years as head maid in the  penthouse, asked a "lady on the switchboard" to help her write a short message  that she wanted to wire to Davis' widow, Altavoise.  </P> <P> "Mr. Davis, he was my baby," Sudbury said, shaking her frosted head of hair  sadly as she took a break in a newly cleaned suite. Next door in the  "Ziegfield," a penthouse suite that was always held open for Davis, hotel  parking attendants were being fitted for new uniforms.  </P> <P> Sudbury joined them, poking her way past racks of gray and scarlet uniforms to  point out where the entertainer's favorite furniture could no longer be found.  </P> <P> "He was so neat and so clean," she said. "A fine gentleman Mr. Davis was."  </P> <P> She examined the carefully printed note one more time. "Dear Mrs. Davis," it  said. "My deepest sympathy. I am so sorry that Mr. Davis passed away. I hope I  see you one day."  </P> <P> It was signed, "Maria on the 26th floor."  </P></p>

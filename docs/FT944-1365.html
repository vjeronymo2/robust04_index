			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / Balladur in fresh offensive on jobs Mr Edouard Balladur, French prime minister, yesterday proposed to cut sickness insurance charges for lower-paid workers, in another move to encourage hiring by French employers and to reduce the country's high unemployment. The proposal, made in Le Monde newspaper, comes amid other signs that the debate between Gaullist contenders for the presidency is lurching to the left, on to political terrain left vacant by Mr Jacques Delors' refusal to be the Socialist candidate. Mr Balladur has already shifted some of the burden of family allowance charges from companies to the state budget. But despite public pressure from the Bank of France to close the public deficit, he now proposes making the same switch for sickness insurance charges. Reducing such charges on lower-paid workers would cost the state FFr13bn (Dollars 2.53bn), and a total of FFr60bn if extended to all employees, Mr Balladur said. In his broad-ranging article, he said he would use France's presidency of the European Union which starts next month to propose to the EU's 15 members a convention on employment, social security protection and vocational training. The swing to the left is being led by Mr Jacques Chirac who launched his first big campaign rally in Lyons last week with an attack on the country's conservative rulers. In another sign of France's shifting political landscape, pro-Chirac deputies joined the socialist and communist opposition yesterday to pass a resolution urging the government not to agree to a new international code against direct subsidies to shipbuilders. However, the government appears committed to joining the rest of the EU in approving the code.</p>

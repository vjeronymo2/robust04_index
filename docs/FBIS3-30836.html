			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Mircea Cosea, minister of state and chairman </F> of the Council for Economic Coordination, Strategy, and Reform,  by Gilda Lazar; place and date not given: "I Hope that the  Coalition Government Will Also Include Representatives of the  Opposition"]    [Text] When the politically independent economist Mircea  Cosea agreed to become a member of the PDSR [Social Democracy  Party of Romania] government and took over the chairmanship of  the Council for Economic Coordination, Strategy, and Reform,  some people thought he was compromising, while others thought he  was sacrificing. One the one hand they said his move was not  fair play with respect to his colleague [former council  chairman] Misu Negritoiu, while on the other they said that  Cosea's gesture had been made out of his loyalty to reform. Was  it vanity and his wish to climb up the ladder, or rather taking  on a burden he could not avoid? The various opinions were  identical merely in two points, namely that Cosea's appointment  will be beneficial for the party [the PDSR], and that the  process initiated by Negritoiu will continue, as Cosea is the  sole trully reform-oriented member of the Vacaroiu government.  His predecessor's role as the father of the theory of reform  and as a "decorative object" to cultivate the West's delight  seemed to be concluded. Before accepting his appointment, Cosea  asked, and they promised, that they would grant him, full  decision-making power. Today, five months later, Cosea is only  allowed to decide upon who should be hired as cleaning personnel  in his ministry. In all other issues he solely "involves"  himself. Although he acted as a rebel during cabinet meetings,  he still managed to be on good terms with Prime Minister Nicolae  Vacaroiu and with the other members of the cabinet, without  being vehemently opposed, the way his predecessor, Negritoiu,  was. However, recently he still found himself in a similar  situation: They threatened to have him deposed. His position as  the second man in the government seems to be too important and  craved for by others.    Thus, Cosea was the first case to which the National  Romanian  Unity Party's [PUNR's] demands referred to: All ministers  should be party members. The first compromise step was followed  by a second [reference to the fact that Cosea recently joined  the PSDR]. What was it this time? Was it feebleness,  opportunism, or rather wisdom and readiness to assume the risks?  Of course, he must have agreed with a certain reluctance and  only after negotiations regarding, among other things, the  leadership of State Property Fund [FPS]. But one should always  watch out for the Trojan horse! One should always watch out for  the PDSR, even if promised something. Cosea thought that, being  inside that party, he could impose his point of view and forgot  about the other side of the coin, namely about the party  discipline that is valid for all party members, and which should  be obeyed particularly by the "greenhorns" and the "ordinary"  members who hold no party office. He is allowed to express his  opinions about economic issues while in Davos, Switzerland, but  forbidden to express political views in Bucharest, Romania. His  party boss, [PDSR Executive Chairman] Adrian Nastase, considers  that [PDSR Deputy Chairman Ioan] Manzatu, for instance, is a far  more authorized and experienced person to make such statements.  Anyway, in the future it may be interesting to see just how far  Cosea will go and how far the PDSR is prepared to go along with  him.  <H3>  "My Joining the Party Cannot Be Interpreted As an Adherence  Coming From My Heart and Soul" </H3>   [Lazar] You have repeatedly stated that you were and would  always be a politically independent person. However, recently  you enrolled in the ruling party, saying that otherwise you  could not put up with so much pressure. Do you think that you  will be more powerful acting from within that party?    [Cosea] Yes, I believe that I will be more powerful acting  from within the party, but I will not use it for personal  purposes, but rather for the implementation of the action in  which I have involved myself so much, namely the implementation  of the accord concluded with IMF [International Monetary Fund].  That accord would eliminate the lag between Romanian reform and  those in the neighboring countries, because that is the major  discrepancy, not the one between the development stages of our  economies. The balance of power in our parliament is very  fragile. This spirit of revenge and the continuous political  strife are quite tiresome for us, all those who are working on  our economy. It has become an obsession that our reform is  being blocked by either one of the opponent parties, and my  position as a politically independent person has been looked  upon with suspicion by the political groupings that do not seem  to comprehend that, in the current stage of Romania's  development, economy should be a unique issue for all political  parties. That is why I reached the conclusion that I need very  substantial political support, not merely to keep the reform  going on while it is still hot, but also for me to achieve more  strength for the struggle I wage in my relations with various  structures. My joining the party cannot be interpreted as an  adherence coming from my heart and soul. I am far too rational  a person and too tired of this transition period to believe in  enthusiasm and swaggering adhesion statements.    [Lazar] Did they request you to join the PDSR to keep your  ministerial office?    [Cosea] The PDSR had lured me to join the government without  naming any terms at that time, but rather by accepting the  program and the ideas I was circulating publicly, as well as my  whole activity, which did contest certain structures. Perhaps,  the surprise some people experienced when I joined that party  might have been attenuated had they considered the fact that the  latest measures, goals, economic forecasts, and even the  short-term programs advanced recently by the PDSR are  considerably different compared to those it proposed during the  [1992] electoral campaign. The recent ones are much closer to  what one could term "the spirit of reform," regardless of  whether one wishes to admit it or not.    [Lazar] Did your keeping the office of chairman of the  Reform Council weigh more in the balance than remaining a  politically independent economist?    [Cosea] As you have already noted, after my experience with  the Communist Party, I did assert that I would remain an  independent person, although, to tell you frankly, none of the  parties of today's Romania has a clear-cut ideology. On the  other hand, very many intellectuals fully engaged in the  implementation of reform feel the need to unite their efforts  under a certain guardianship. The attempts to unite us within  special professional groups, I am talking about the Romanian  Society of Economy, have not satisfied that need, because we  need political support in our struggle. Well, it seems that,  today, our parties will only grant such support to their  members. It is a pity that the main issue seems to be one's  party membership rather than the fact that one is a promoter of  reform.  <H3>  "If They Do Not Sign the Accord With the IMF, My Offer To  Resign Remains Valid" </H3>   [Lazar] A daily printed on yellow paper [reference to the  daily CRONICA ROMANA] recently claimed that you might fall  victim to the cabinet reshuffle because you threatened to resign  too often. After the political move you have made [by joining  the ruling party] the cabinet reshuffle will not affect you  personally. However, is your assertion still valid, namely that  you would resign if the accord concluded with the IMF is not  signed by Romania?    [Cosea] Of course it remains valid and it can even be  extended over other elements. You see, I am not just any  government member, I am the chairman of the Reform Council. My  whole concept related to the reform of Romania's economy is  based on two principles: foreign financing and internal  restructuring. This means that without foreign financing I  would be unable to implement the reform and therefore,  certainly, my offer to resign remains valid.    [Lazar] Our accord with the IMF could have become effective  as early as December last year, or January, had the interests of  our political parties not prevailed. Have you assessed the  costs of those delays for Romania's economy?    [Cosea] I hoped very much that the accord would become  effective rapidly. December might have been a utopia, but it  ought to have been January. The reform is currently blocked  owing to the lack of foreign assistance. Whether we like it or  not, whether we so wish or not, the IMF represents the sole  chance we have of making any changes this year. It is  impossible to evaluate the costs you mentioned, how much and so  on. However, the delays can be measured. These delays mean  great difficulty in the adjusting of our foreign currency  policy, of our foreign currency reserve, and especially -- this  is a very grave thing -- no funds are available from the World  Bank.    [Lazar] How much money did we miss from the World Bank?    [Cosea] This year, the World Bank was to finance extremely  important programs, such as the educational and agricultural  programs, those intended to revive our oil industry, and so on.  If one considers the losses caused by the blocking of the  modernization of particular branches, an evaluation can be done  and its results are certainly very serious. However, I would  like to avoid being too pessimistic and I do not want to  dishearten your readers either. Not all time has been wasted  yet. If we can resort to foreign financing by the middle of  March, at the latest, we will still have real chances of  implementing those programs. However, this presupposes that,  before that, all political interests and relations should be  cleared up among the parties and that parliament passes the  [IMF] memorandum. Under such circumstances, I think I have made  it quite obvious that the political involvement of the persons  who negotiated the document is extremely important.  <H5>  "The Memorandum Is the Basis of the Government Program" </H5>   [Lazar] Might the memorandum be considered as an equivalent  of the government program, at least in this year, when the  government is expected to explicitly assume responsibility for  it?    [Cosea] The memorandum is the basis of the government  program. However, those two documents cannot be identical,  because there is a great many details and particular elements  that ought to be taken into consideration. Aside from that, I  fully agree with you that the memorandum represents the basis,  the basic structure, the skeleton of the government program.    [Lazar] Why does the PDSR fear that the opposition will  vote against the memorandum, considering that many of the  principles of that document also occur in the programs of the  opposition parties?    [Cosea] As I stated when I returned from Washington, I am  personally convinced that the opposition, judging from  everything it has declared and done so far, will prove to be  open to the idea of foreign financing, and especially that it  will favor all methods intended to speed up reform. Their [the  PDSR's] fear comes from the specific nature of Romanian  parliamentary and political life, with its constant ambushes and  guerrilla warfare. They are afraid that the balance of  political forces might be altered in parliament, which is quite  possible if the memorandum is submitted to a vote. Although I do  not wish to be a Dutch uncle, I would still like to suggest that  the issue of the memorandum should be taken out of the category  of politically opportune issues, because it is far too important  for that and I do not think that any of our parties could afford  to sacrifice 23 million people for the sake of a few more seats  in parliament.    [Lazar] I think we should clear up certain things. Who  requested that the memorandum should be passed by parliament?  As far as I know, is was the wish of the Romanian Government,  rather than that of the IMF, as was being claimed today.    [Cosea] You can find the answer to that in something that  happened more recently. Previously, the memorandum was  presented to parliament by [former Prime Minister Theodor]  Stolojan. It was the premier's wish to be fully open about what  he was doing. He did that because they criticized the way in  which the previous memorandum had been concluded. Stolojan  presented the memorandum, but he did not have it submitted to a  vote. However, one can say that this tradition served as a  basis for the way things were conceived for this year. The IMF  suggested that the memorandum should be presented to parliament.  However, during our difficult and quite lengthy negotiations,  they repeatedly resorted to the argument that the Romanian party  lacks credibility.    [Lazar] What were the causes of that lack of credibility?    [Cosea] Above all it was the fact that the stipulations of  the previous accords had not been fully carried out. Second,  the continuous political fighting in parliament created the  impression abroad, and I am sure that this impression still  exists, that the government alone does not have the ability to  vouch for the implementation of the document. All this led to  the idea that the memorandum should be presented and submitted  to the vote of parliament. By this, the IMF tried to ensure  that the opposition knows the stipulations included in the  memorandum and consents to those terms.    [Lazar] Don't you think that this has made things even more  complicated?    [Cosea] Of course we made things more complicated for  ourselves, because we could have bypassed parliament. However,  I still think that its endorsement is very necessary and,  therefore, in my opinion, this tradition should be maintained  for future negotiations as well. As you said, the IMF accord  represents an important part of Romania's government program.  The IMF accord gives that government program precisely the  things it lacked initially: concreteness and a practical aspect.  <H3>  "What Romania Needs Now Is a Coalition Government Including  All Opposition Parties" </H3>   [Lazar] Besides the communist background of our current  rulers, social instability, labor actions, and ethnic problems,  foreign political analysts assess that the nationalist-extremist  political groupings also represent an element of risk for  Romania. What is the point in having the IMF memorandum passed  if, meanwhile, the ruling party sets up a coalition government  with the National Romanian Unity Party [PUNR] or the extreme  left-wing parties?    [Cosea] The [PDSR's] alliance with the PUNR, for instance,  is greatly disadvantageous. Abroad, they consider the PUNR an  extremist party. Thus it is quite obvious that great  difficulties will emerge again in Romania's international  relations. This is something that worries me very much, because  I lived through the period following the miners' incursion [in  1991 in Bucharest] and I know what it means to have to kneel,  trying to justify and explain things and make promises all the  time.    [Lazar] What would be, in your opinion, the ideal government  formula that could create a favorable image of Romania abroad?    [Cosea] What Romania needs now is a coalition government  including all opposition parties, that is, those that do not  represent the current majority in parliament. Of course, this  would also have a reverse side, namely that the parties of the  current majority in parliament would also have to be included,  and this practically means the setting up of a national union  government. However, considering the incompatibility existing  among certain parties, such a government is hardly achievable.    [Lazar] How could they reach a convenient formula?    [Cosea] I suppose that if they had held longer and more  flexible negotiations, they could have managed to set up a party  including all principal elements of the opposition. Such a  thing would have resulted in two major advantages: First,  Romania's image would have been different, and second -- this  would have been fantastic -- political aversion would have been  bypassed, as they would have set out from the idea that there  are reformers in all camps. Reform is not the prerogative of  the government party, or only that of the opposition. Another  advantage is that they would have found an easier way to  negotiate with the trade unions.   <H3>    "Oscillations Between the Limits Imposed by the  Memorandum and the Limits of the Administration" </H3>   [Lazar] The memorandum contains a number of stipulations  that are already outdated or will soon be outdated, and  therefore they will not be implemented (the draft budget has not  been forwarded to parliament yet; the Restructuring Agency is  not under the authority of the State Property Fund; the  financial unblocking of companies is being done selectively, and  so on). Do you not think that the government is using this  period until the document becomes effective to pay off old  scores instead of using it to promote the memorandum?    [Cosea] I do not think the government has any old scores to  pay off, and even if it did, it would not be able to do so. You  know very well that the government does not have any power [to  implement the reform]. It is like a horseman riding a rocking-  horse. The real power lies with the State Property Fund.  However, the problem you mentioned does exist, and it consists  of the fact that certain particular and yet important elements  display an oscillation between the various factors  characterizing the memorandum [sentence as published]. The  reason is quite simple: Whereas the memorandum is a document  with extremely clear-cut technical features, Romania's economy,  unfortunately, does not display a similarly clarity.    [Lazar] In other words, the memorandum cannot be  implemented?    [Cosea] Can we afford to implement it, for instance, by not  paying salaries in companies that are in financial blockage?  Can we afford to renounce certain elements ensuring the  survival of our economy in order to observe some technical  stipulations? The answer is not just yes, we can afford it, but  also that this is what we should do. If not, we will be taking  half measures and following the policy of fait accompli again,  and then we will be amazed again that so many things went wrong,  although I am sure that, on the following day, we would be  justifying our failure by various theories and nice-sounding  declarations.    [Lazar] Are such oscillations not dangerous?    [Cosea] If the foreign financing would have been available  at the end of December last year, the way I had hoped, very many  problems related to the limits imposed by the memorandum and the  limits of the administration would have been solved by now.    [Lazar] Still, under such circumstances, the figures  established by the memorandum seem to be unrealistic.    [Cosea] For the time being, I can still assert that  everything included in the memorandum is realistic. I would  like to emphasize again that the memorandum is a strictly  economic and very technical document, although its success  depends 90 percent on the political climate. No well-conceived  monetary measure and no fiscal or budgetary technical measure  can have positive effects if the relationship among owners and  users, between property and production is not regulated  adequately.  <H5>  "Privatization Presupposes Political Will" </H5>   [Lazar] But such regulations actually mean privatization.    [Cosea] That is right, this is the great problem of  privatization, which, by the way, I do not consider an issue  that should be regarded as a performance criteria. [It is  unimportant] whether in 1994 we privatize 2,000 or rather 4,000  companies. It is unimportant whether the [privatization]  project is ambitious or not. If we do not manage to turn this  capital of 2,000 companies into private property, we will fail  in solving the most important problem of Romania's economy: the  under-capitalization of our companies. All Romanian enterprises  have been conceived in such a way so as to be under-capitalized.  You know, formerly, loans used to be very cheap and they were a  means of keeping the economy under political control.    [Lazar] That may be the case today as well.    [Cosea] Current capitalization is immense. However this  merely refers to the fixed capital. The floating capital, that  is, the cash flow, are still at a very low level. No Romanian  company can avoid financial blockage because as long as its  owner is the state, it will never have sufficient floating  capital. This problem could be solved if the constant part of  the capital would be sold, transferred to the private circuit.    [Lazar] You have to admit that such a move presupposes  political will.    [Cosea] Yes, that is what it takes, political will. And the  State Property Fund should become what is actually should be,  namely a factor promoting privatization. In that respect,  things are not very clear yet and therefore not really favorable  for the implementation of the memorandum.    [Lazar] Relations between the Reform Council and the State  Property Fund have become increasingly tense. Is that not also  blocking privatization?    [Cosea] The relations between the Council and the State  Property Fund have obviously become increasingly complex,  because, after all, the word contradiction is one way of  interpreting that complexity. At the Council, we are Currently  preparing a government decision, which could also be turned into  a legislative initiative, that does not intend to alter the bill  on privatization, but rather to speed up that process. This  does not mean that it is enough if we speed up the selling of  shares, because, in Romania, privatization has stopped owing to  the inflation, lack of capital, too high taxes, customs  regulations that do not support production, and owing to the  impossibility for people to sell or buy land and other real  estate assets. Somehow the false idea was created that  privatization means that a large number of private companies  should emerge overnight, but we did not ponder enough what we  will do with them in the long run. The situation is similar to  the fairy tale of the mother eagle that has to eat up its chicks  as soon as they first see daylight in order to make place for  the next eggs in the nest.   <H5>    "I Have No Idea What Color the PDSR Is" </H5>   [Lazar] When you took over office you stated that you wish  to obtain decision-making power for the Council. The decision  that was recently taken by the government [establishing the  competence of the Reform Council] contains dozens of phrases  such as "it approves," "drafts," "elaborates," or "proposes,"  but -- except for the hiring its own personnel -- it does not  contain any "it decides." What things were you able to decide  upon before that government decision came, what decisions can  you take currently, and what decisions will you be able to take  in the future, considering that now you have a political color?    [Cosea] I am not very sure that I really look like an Easter  egg, being politically colored. That would not bring me any  advantages and I do not like to color myself either. I have no  idea what color the PDSR is. The discussions that preceded the  government decision referring to the competence of the Council  were very long and complicated. It was established that I  cannot take decisions affecting the activity of ministries.  However, owing to the fact that we are supposed to approve the  decisions taken by ministries, we can still block their activity  if it contradicts reform.    [Lazar] That is not very much, is it?    [Cosea] The fact that I can directly intervene in all  activities regarding the legislative and organizational aspects  gives me a large maneuvering space and great satisfaction. The  most important activities in which we are also involved are the  restructuring of whole branches according to the drafts  elaborated by ministries and the large-scale privatization  actions. The Council has the right to regulate the economic  restructuring actions. In this way, actually, the whole  activity of the ministries is under our control.    [Lazar] That resembles centralism very much.    [Cosea] That is a control over the strategy and the general  orientation [of the ministries], and does not refer to the  budgetary and personnel aspects or to day-by-day activities. We  involve ourselves directly in concrete actions designed to  privatize large companies, such as Tarom [national air company]  or the mineral water sector. We are even trying to elaborate a  methodology of the privatization of successful companies, that  is, those that foreign investors would obviously be glad to buy  and that therefore can be easily sold.    [Lazar] "Involvement" or "intervention" still does not mean  "decision."    [Cosea] Everybody expected that the Reform Council would  issue decisions appointing or firing people, or other such  decisions. Unfortunately, we are not empowered to take such  decisions.    [Lazar] You said that the coming six months will be  decisive. Do you think that the government, after a reshuffle,  will survive over the next half-year?    [Cosea] For the time being I cannot answer that question,  because I do not have all the information I would need for that.  I know, however, that, over the next months, Romania needs a  government much more than early elections. The country's  political stability has to be maintained, no matter what the  risks are or what compromise has to be reached. It is true,  holding general elections now could result in the clearing up of  the political situation, so one of the problems would be solved,  but on the other hand such elections could ruin other things.  Among those other things I would mention the one that, today,  is most the most important for the nation: the settlement and  the balancing of our economy. I think that achieving the same  things in our political life can still wait. Over the next six  months, the cabinet might be reshuffled quite often. I hope,  and this is a personal wish of mine, that over the coming six  months a coalition government will be set up with the  representatives of the opposition.</p>

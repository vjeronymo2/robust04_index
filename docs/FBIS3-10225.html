[Sanin] Good morning, Dario.    [Arizmendi] What is the government's position on the results  of President Cesar Gaviria's trip to Japan? The president is on  his way back to Colombia.    [Sanin] The trip was a complete success in every aspect. He  was successful when he appeared before businessmen to seek  investments and economic support, when he appeared at  universities and parliament, during his meeting with the emperor  and Japanese prime minister. He was successful in all the  meetings he held. He secured financial support for Cusiana,  (Diarari), and Calima III, for all the projects for which he  requested financial support. The trip produced wonderful  results.    [Arizmendi] The president has asked Japan to back Colombia's  bid to become an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation [APEC]  member. This membership is theoretically impossible until 1996.  How important is it for Colombia to form part of that  organization?    [Sanin] It would mean our full incorporation into the  Pacific  region. We already belong to (Pibec) [not further identified].  This is the product of a big effort by this government. This  has meant the arrival of the private sector into Pacific forums.  We will be received in Malaysia in March as a full-rights  associate member of (TOP), the Economic Council for the Pacific,  where the private sector, the government, and the academy [not  further identified] have working groups and form associations to  strengthen ties among Pacific countries.    Private businessmen will be able to establish links with  30,000 enterprises and will be able to trade, look for  investments, and exchange technological experiences. We [words  indistinct] but crowned our efforts with success. This has  been, perhaps, one of our foreign policy's best accomplishments.  The next step by APEC will be to link all the Pacific  countries, including the United States and Canada.    APEC aims to associate with the academic, political, and  private points of view, all the countries of America and the  Asian Pacific, the entire Pacific. We are working in that  direction. We are participating in the forums in which we must  participate. We are getting ready. I think the president's  visit to Japan was of definite importance for our entrance into  the grand Pacific project, because we were able to demonstrate  our interest on that.    I think we are embarking on a road toward the future,  because  progress in the financial and service sectors, in technology, in  all the most important sector, including the academic sector, is  taking place in the Pacific.    [Arizmendi] A former Venezuelan foreign minister has again  launched verbal attacks against Colombia in recent hours. Now  he has called for solidarity from certain neighboring countries  to demand that Colombia change its position. The Colombian  Foreign Ministry has maintained relative silence on the  declarations by Ochoa Antich. Will it maintain this silence, or  will it be necessary to respond more strongly to Ochoa?    [Sanin] Former Foreign Minister Ochoa Antich is a Venezuelan  [words indistinct] Colombia had very close relations with him.  When he was foreign minister we obviously had to respond to his  statements. We agreed at that time with many of his statements  and did not agree with certain others. When this happened, we  had to express our opinion, but Ochoa is now a politician, a  columnist. His opinions are not official; thus it would be  unwise for me to exchange opinions with him every time he, as a  politician, issues his own opinions, because then we would be  acting also as politicians, and we would then face very  difficult relations with a country, Venezuela, with which we  want to maintain the best relations possible.    [Arizmendi] Nonetheless, he charged that through you  Colombia has apparently offered to support and vote for Dr.  Burelli Rivas so he could aspire to the post of OAS secretary  general. What is the truth of this charge?    [Sanin] I believe, first, we should not have described that  as a charge. We have seen countries such as Argentina change  positions once President Gaviria's candidacy was presented.  Argentina now fully supports Colombia, and that is the Latin  American position. The idea is to have a leader, a great  spokesman at the OAS, the most important organization of the  hemisphere. In the case you mentioned, however, Colombia never  made a commitment.    We held a meeting on that day in which President Ramon J.  Velasquez presented Venezuela's hopes that we support the  current Venezuelan foreign minister. We praised his personality  and work; he had been a very good ambassador to Colombia.  Perhaps this was mistaken for support. I think this is a  problem of interpretation, and we cannot continue to dwell on  this or turn it into a diplomatic problem or conflict.  Actually, there was no commitment. We have not written any  letter supporting the Venezuelan candidacy. We respect it. He  is a highly qualified and experienced person, but we did not  commit ourselves. I think this is a problem of  misinterpretation.    [Arizmendi] A problem has come up recently at the OAS in  light of the various candidacies that are being discussed.  Costa Rican Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus Quesada, who is  another strong candidate to become the OAS secretary general,  has affirmed to the media he has at least 22 votes. Caracol has  asked questions among diplomatic sources, and it has been able  to determine that Colombia has from eight to nine votes and that  Niehaus has 15 written votes. At least 18 votes are needed for  election. What are the possibilities today of President Cesar  Gaviria's hopes for OAS secretary general?    [Sanin] When the president told Colombians and the  international public he accepted the nomination made by the  heads of state for the post of OAS secretary general, he said  according to consultations we had made, including via the  Colombian Foreign Ministry, he had solid support; that is the  impression I have. I think we have the necessary and sufficient  votes so that as of 7 August, the president of the Republic will  become the OAS secretary general.    [Arizmendi] As of the first round?    [Sanin] I think so; that is for what I am hoping, and I am  working on that. I think that will be the case. According to  what I have been told, that is the way it will be. Even though  Foreign Minister Niehaus has given those figures.... [pauses]  Not so long ago, he was giving other figures. First he  mentioned 22 votes, and it seems he will have less and less as  the days go by.    I do not want to talk about figures or numbers of votes. We  are hoping President Gaviria's nomination will be the candidacy  of unity and that it will express the spirit of Latin America.  Let's hope it will be the result of a consensus, although it is  very difficult, because candidate Niehaus, as you said, has been  working on this for two and a half years. He has some votes but  not the votes he claims to have. Are you sure of the number of  votes he claims to have at this time?    [Arizmendi] Yes.    [Sanin] The votes you claim President Gaviria has are very  far from reality.    [Arizmendi] What figures do you have?    [Sanin] The truth is the president has sufficient support  for  becoming OAS secretary general.    [Arizmendi] In this first round?    [Sanin] In this first round. Those are our hopes.    [Arizmendi] That means he has at least 18 to 19 guaranteed  votes?    [Sanin] [giggling] Yes sir.    [Arizmendi] We know Foreign Minister Niehaus has 15 written  votes; in other words, that would mean 34 votes. Is that  correct? [giggles]    [Sanin] I do not want to count votes; actually, we are  talking about hemispheric integration, a fluid dialogue, support  for democracy, and a defense of democracy via cooperation and a  permanent dialogue. Actually, we are not counting votes. We  are voicing a message of solidarity, of integration, and of  cooperation, which are what our hemisphere needs.    [Arizmendi] Inasmuch as you have mentioned integration,  cooperation [words indistinct], and the fact we want good  relations with Venezuela, things do not seem that easy, not only  due to this case of the OAS secretary general but also what  concerns Venezuela's internal economic policy. The private  sector is very much concerned over how this will affect  business, for example, if there is a devaluation of the bolivar.  There is also a concern over the future of the Group of Three,  [words indistinct] economic integration after what President  Caldera has done.    [Sanin] I want to tell you in these days I have stayed in  Colombia I have been speaking with Colombian entrepreneurs, with  exporters, with many politicians who are interested in this  subject. I have had a very fluid dialogue with the Venezuelan  foreign minister, as well as in Mexico when we attended an OAS  cooperation meeting. Yesterday, we had a very lengthy telephone  conversation. He told me the following, and this is something  the Venezuelan president had already told me: First of all,  there will not be a massive devaluation in Venezuela. He told  me we could rest assured in this regard. Second, he said there  will not be an exchange crisis. Third, they support  integration, are committed to this; they want to work for  integration and defend it, just as we do.    The Venezuelan president was one of the builders of the  Andean Pact, and he strongly believes in it. Thus, they  continue with the idea of defending integration at all costs.  They had to take certain very strong measures to defend the  financial sector. The foreign minister told me all banks will  open as of Friday. I believe one bank had been closed.  Measures were adopted so that this financial crisis would not  harm the depositors so much. They are adopting strong measures,  attacking a crisis with solutions. I feel integration is  irreversible. Obviously, the macroeconomic measures will have  to be consulted more, and sometimes there will be people who  favor the exports from one or another country, but I have the  impression we are not going to have any big problems for the  time being. This is what the foreign minister told me, and  these are the guarantees he gave me.    [Arizmendi] There is a scandal in the United States with  Maria del Rosario Casas, our former cultural attache at the  Colombian Embassy in Mexico. You requested from Gabriel Silva  Lujan, the Colombian ambassador to Washington, that he formally  request an explanation from the State Department regarding the  entire case. Have you received a reply?    [Sanin] Yes, because.... [pauses] I cannot understand how a  friendly nation such as the United States can hire a Colombian  diplomatic official for intelligence work. I find that  unacceptable under any point of view.    I spoke to our ambassador to the White House yesterday and  asked him what news he had on the issue. He explained to me the  case is before the courts, and while it is in the judiciary  stage we will not have an answer. I will keep the public  informed of the case, because, as I said before, I cannot  understand this affair.    [Arizmendi] Could we be on the verge of a formal protest  note  to the U.S. Government over the CIA hiring an attache--an  official from our embassy--as a spy at its service?    [Sanin] I prefer not to speak of that. The only thing I must  state strongly is that I fully disagree with any country using  the services of a diplomatic official who is obligated by ethics  and the law to defend the interests of his or her country in  functions that are totally different from serving the fatherland.    [Arizmendi] We thank you very much for making these  statements to "Caracol's 0600-0900" newscast.    To conclude, we have another question. You are constantly  being mentioned as a running mate for any of the two  presidential candidates--the conservative Andres Pastrana or the  liberal Ernesto Samper Pizano--for vice president of the  Republic. Are you restricted by the law or by a resolution of  the State Council?    [Sanin] I have not had time to see whether I am qualified;  nonetheless, you give me good news when you say I might be a  running mate for any of the two candidates, because all I want  is to serve Colombians, regardless of political parties....    [Arizmendi, interrupting] Which one would you prefer?    [Sanin] No, I am not going to get involved in political  affairs. I am very happy serving Colombia's interests,  representing Colombia. For the time being, I am not going to  get involved in politics.    [Arizmendi] Not for the time being, but how about in the  future? Would you like that someday?    [Sanin] One cannot commit oneself to the future, because  each day brings something new. I always uphold that. Forgive  me for repeating this. I am a person of faith, and I think God  points out the paths He wants us to follow. I do not put  conditions on my life. One thing I will tell you: My policy is  to serve Colombia, to interpret an international policy, that of  President Gaviria and of the country, of the new Constitution.  I feel very happy as foreign minister, and I am not thinking of  anything different for the time being.</p>

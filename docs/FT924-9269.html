			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / Battery maker reviews staffing EVER READY, the battery manufacturer, is to cut 175 jobs at its Newburn plant, Newcastle upon Tyne, as part of a review of its European operations by Ralston Purina, its US parent. The cuts follow a decision to end production of alkaline batteries at Newburn. A staff of 30 will remain to continue producing zinc-carbon batteries. The Newburn factory will operate as a satellite of the company's other plant at Tanfield Lea, County Durham. Ever Ready, which was acquired by the consumer-products conglomerate in July, said the single European market meant battery companies operating single, large-scale manufacturing plants would increasingly have a competitive cost advantage over those with small factories serving individual countries.</p>

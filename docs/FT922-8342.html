			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Money Markets: Paper held back MONDAY'S lingering hopes about an imminent base rate cut were extinguished yesterday, as traders in the sterling money markets hardened to the view that 10 per cent base rates are here for some time to come. In spite of yesterday's low rise in the April producer price index, the market is convinced that the UK authorities are unlikely to respond by bringing rates down now. 'For all the hype about low interest rates, the market's perception is that we are hard up against Germany,' said one trader. A few market participants may be hopeful. The unwillingness of discount houses in recent days to offer paper to the Bank of England has suggested that market players think a cut could come soon. On Monday, there was a shortfall of Pounds 270m in paper offered to meet the shortage, and that was repeated again yesterday to the tune of around Pounds 100m. 'Historically, when interest rates come down, people do not offer paper because they hope it might happen again,' said one trader yesterday. But other market players read little into this, believing that it is due to technical factors, such as a number of banks being long on money. In the interbank market, period rates continued to form a virtually flat curve: everything from 1-month to 5-month money registered a rate of 10 1/8 per cent yesterday. 6-month and 9-month money ended the day a fraction lower at 10 1/16 per cent. In the futures market, the June short sterling contract ended the day trading at 89.93, a figure which assumes that base rates in June will be 10.07 per cent. In the discount market, the Bank of England forecast a shortage in the morning of Pounds 750m. In early operations, the Bank purchased bills totalling Pounds 129m, of which Pounds 50m were Band-1 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent, Pounds 48m were Band-2 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent and Pounds 31m were for resale to the market on June 1 at an interest rate of 9 15/16 per cent. The forecast was then revised to a shortage of about Pounds 800m. In further operations, the Bank bought Pounds 99m of Band-1 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent and Pounds 117m for resale to the market on June 1 at an interest rate of 9 15/16 per cent. In the afternoon, the Bank purchased Pounds 327m of Band-1 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent. The Bank provided late assistance of around Pounds 170m.</p>

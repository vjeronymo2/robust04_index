			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / International Company News: Keppel Bank launches public share offering KEPPEL Bank of Singapore, owned by diversified marine conglomerate Keppel Corp, will today offer 100m new shares and 20m vendor shares for public subscription. The offer will come in three tranches at SDollars 2.40 a share or more, Reuter reports from Singapore. The offer, which closes on June 17, will enable the bank to be listed on the main board of the local bourse. Of 120m shares, 42m will be issued at a fixed price of SDollars 2.40 each, while another 42m shares will be sold though a tender with a minimum price of SDollars 2.50. The remaining 36m shares have been privately placed with three financial agencies, at SDollars 2.50 per share, it said. Twenty million shares have been taken up by the Investment Company of the People's Republic of China (Singapore); 10m by Malaysia's Southern Bank; and the remaining 6m by American International Assurance. 'For the fixed-price tranche, each applicant may apply for up to 10,000 shares,' Keppel Bank said. The proceeds will be used to support the bank's operations in Singapore and the rest of South East Asia. 'We have already applied for a branch licence in Vietnam and will be applying for a representative office in China,' Mr Benedict Kwek, Keppel Bank's president, said. The issue is lead-managed by Keppel Bank and co-managed by Schroder International Merchant Bankers. The issue is underwritten by a syndicate of 17 underwriters. The bank's existing SDollars 1 shares total 331m. As at December 31 1992, shareholders funds were SDollars 486m (USDollars 303.7m) and those of the group, SDollars 514m.

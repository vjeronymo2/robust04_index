			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / British Airways: Business code explains honesty 'is not just telling truth' This is the text of BA's code of business conduct: THE success of BA is dependent on the quality of the decisions and the behaviour of individuals at all levels throughout the organisation. The code has been developed to provide guidance and assistance to both managers and staff in their dealings with all those with whom we do business, with our customers and suppliers, and with each other. Adherence to the principles will help ensure that our reputation and success that has been built up over the years through the dedicated hard work of you and your colleagues will continue to grow. Judgment and discretion will need to be exercised in applying the principles where, at first sight, they appear to be at variance with local custom and practice or commercial common sense. It is not the intent of the code to anticipate and provide a framework of governing values and advice on how to proceed when making difficult decisions, namely to establish the norms of business behaviour throughout BA. General standards: Compliance: Comply with all the laws that regulate and apply to the company, its systems and the conduct of its business. Fairness: Treat all groups and individuals with whom we have a business relationship in a fair, open and respectful manner. Integrity: Show respect for the individual, treating each in a consistent way and honouring commitments made. Openness: Share and declare information on personal and corporate conflicts of interest (political, financial, relationship) including the offer or acceptance of gifts or hospitality of significant value. Seek guidance and where appropriate confirmation from a higher authority before acting. Honesty: This goes beyond simply telling the truth to ensuring that any misrepresentation is quickly corrected. Do not allow people to be misled. Where there are valid reasons for withholding information, be clear about the motives and if possible explain why are doing so. Fair competition: Ensure comparisons drawn with competitors and working partners are based on fact and avoid innuendo. Competition should be based on the quality value and integrity of British Airways' service and products. Determination: Demonstrate a sense of purpose and commitment to achieving the optimum outcome even in adversity. Responsiveness: Recognise changes in the business environment and use a creative flexible style to respond to them. Enablement: Provide sufficient guidance to enable individuals to act upon their own initiative to solve problems and grow in their role. Conformity: Promote corporate values and competitive edge through the established performance systems of performance and appraisal. Through employing these practices and behaviours, staff should: Use British Airways' stated goals and objectives as guidance, using your values and judgment to interpret against the principles of this code. Treat others as you would like to be treated. Be prepared to solicit views as to whether something would be appropriate before action, rather than after. Discuss difficult decisions with those whose values and judgment you respect. Use company process to earn respect. Ask whether you would feel comfortable explaining your decision or behaviour to your boss, your family or the media. Be prepared to challenge if you believe others are acting in an unethical way. Create the climate and opportunities for people to voice genuinely held concerns about behaviour or decisions that they perceive to be unprofessional or inappropriate. Do not tolerate any form of retribution against those who do speak up. Protect individuals' careers and anonymity if necessary. Encourage an environment of learning from mistakes and mutual trust in each others' motives and judgments. Treat the assets and property of British Airways and its customers and its suppliers with the same respect as you would your own. Apart from tangible assets this would include company information as well as the name, image and reputation of British Airways.</p>

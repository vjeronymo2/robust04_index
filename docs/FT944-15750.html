			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: US economy The overwhelming impression from last week's range of US statistics is of an economy still expanding fairly strongly despite the good headline news on inflation. Industrial production was flat in September, but that followed a sharp gain in August. Cap-acity use dipped slightly but from a figure that had been revised upwards. At 84.6 per cent it displays little sign of slack. Last but not least, retail sales still look strong, with Friday's Michigan consumer sentiment survey showing improved confidence. None of that offers grounds for a reprieve from a further interest rate rise. Indeed, the Federal Reserve may have to remain in tightening mode for some time, whatever happens over the next few weeks. Like the producer price data on Thursday, the retail price figures on Friday benefited from a sharp fall in energy prices. The difference was that the underlying rise, excluding food and energy, was slight-ly more muted than expected. But there is no guarantee that inflation will remain so easily contained, especially given the underlying upward pressure on producer prices for intermediate goods and raw materials. To that problem has suddenly been added dollar weakness. The immediate cause of Friday's sharp fall was demand for D-Marks ahead of yesterday's German election. But the slippage against the yen is also a reminder of how strongly underlying world capital flows work against the US currency. If dollar weakness spills over into Treasury bonds, the Fed may even have to contemplate a rate increase sooner rather than later.</p>

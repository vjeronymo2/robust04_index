			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / International Company News: Sumitomo plans to apply to set up securities arm SUMITOMO Trust &amp; Banking, the leading Japanese trust bank, plans to apply to set up a subsidiary to deal in securities in the year starting on April 1, Reuter reports from Tokyo. The bank said the subsidiary would be capitalised at about Y10bn (Dollars 84m) and have some 30 staff. Financial reforms allowing banks and brokerages to enter each other's business through subsidiaries take effect in April. The securities businesses that a bank's subsidiaries will be allowed to engage in do not initially include stockbroking. Two Japanese long-term credit banks - the Industrial Bank of Japan and Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan - have already announced that they would apply to the ministry of finance to set up securities subsidiaries soon after the reforms took effect. The Norinchukin Bank, the central body for agricultural financial institutions, has also said it is considering such a subsidiary. But Japan's big commercial banks are unlikely to apply in 1993-94, banking analysts say.</p>

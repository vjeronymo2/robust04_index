			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yevgeniy Bagayev under the heading "Regional </F> Privatization": "Kemerovo Seeks Ways of Nationalizing Industry"]    [Text] The regional authorities are unhappy with the  results of voucher-based privatization, which has shut not only  federal but also local bureaucrats out of direct regulation of  enterprises' operations. In contrast to Moscow mayor Yuriy  Luzhkov, who is openly opposed to "Chubays-style" privatization,  outlying administrations are attempting to get around the State  Committee for State Property Management quietly. But the goal is  the same: to use privatization to turn state property into  municipal property. Yesterday Aleksandr Lavrov, chairman of the  Kemerovo Oblast State Property Management Committee, confirmed  in an interview with a KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent the  intention of Kemerovo governor Mikhail Kislyuk to nationalize  the oblast's processing industry.    Mr. Lavrov acknowledged that the local government  "overlooked" privatization of enterprises in the processing  industry "in their haste." A portion of potential investors  (participants in all stages of the processing and sale of  agricultural produce), finding themselves outside the circle of  privileged closed subscription to shares in processing  enterprises, vented their rage on the oblast administration. For  that reason, at a recent oblast meeting of agricultural workers  Mr. Kislyuk told the offended parties that "the administration  is prepared to resort to nationalization of processing  enterprises, which will then make it possible to 're-privatize'  them for the benefit of agricultural producers." However, in Mr.  Lavrov's opinion the administration has no legal right to do so.    Therefore there are most likely two options for the further  development of events. The first is that producers will appeal  to a court of arbitration, asking it to overturn the local  government's decision to privatize processing enterprises.  However, in that case the administration will be blamed for what  happened and will lose its ability to improvise in the sectors  of the economy that are most promising from an investment  standpoint.    Therefore it is clear that the regional authorities will  insist on a different course of events. In the opinion of the  region's leaders, the federal authorities should not only  increase the regional quota for closed subscription on favorable  terms to shares in processing enterprises, but also approve  "from above" the region's initiative aimed at "preventing social  tension" through "re-privatization" of enterprises. In that  scenario, the local administration hopes not only to save face,  but also to gain additional opportunities to redistribute the  item that is in short supply, i.e. shares in enterprises that  are attractive to investors. Furthermore, this second option  gives the executive branch an exceptional opportunity to get  control of (and hang onto) a controlling block of stock in  highly profitable enterprises. It is also possible that in this  manner the administration has commenced the realization of its  plans to select the enterprises that will comprise the basis of  the region's financial-industrial groups, whose operations will  be controlled by the local authorities.</p>

			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Accounting tricks fool many City analysts, says study In spite of their telephone number salaries, many City analysts have proved incapable of understanding company accounts, according to an academic study released yesterday. Just a handful of analysts could see through the most elementary forms of creative accounting in a test of their scrutiny of financial statements.

Window-dressing schemes used were extraordinary items, deferred taxation, non-capitalisation of leased assets, creating profit via asset disposals, non-consolidated subsidiaries, non-subsidiary subsidiaries, pension contribution holidays, merger accounting and hidden interest charges. Prof Taffler said he believed the quality of accounting understanding may have improved since the study was conducted. Mr Chris Clark, head of research at Credit Lyonnais Laing, said: 'In the last two to three years, more people have realised their accounting knowledge is inadequate. I suspect everybody knows they need to raise their operating standards.'

'When I joined in 1989 the quality of accounting understanding was abysmal. I now look for analysts who are accountants.'</p>

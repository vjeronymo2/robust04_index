			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Filip Svarm: "The Return of the District Chief"] </F>   [Text] Mile Martic has finally become president of Krajina  on his second, makeup, attempt. Otherwise, they would have voted  again and a third, fourth, or fifth time, as many times as it  took. That is why there have been no objections to the conduct  and regularity of the elections. There have, however, been  congratulations: Dr. Radovan Karadzic and Nikola Sainovic, M.A.,  have congratulated Martic on his election victory.  Representatives of the pan-Serb interests of Slobodan Milosevic  who have been campaigning with so much fervor at village  meetings and over Radio-TV Serbia in favor of the Krajina police  minister can now go off for a well-deserved rest. That means  that Mihajlo Markovic, member of the academy, no longer has to  wander around Banija, Brana Crncevic and Minister Zoran Bingulac  do not have to freeze in Baranja, and Radmila Milentijevic does  not have to explain to Krsto Bijelic why Milan Babic must not  win. It probably was also a relief both to Dr. Franjo Tudjman  and to the doves in Krajina.  <H5>  A Miracle in Krajina </H5>   In the first round of the Krajina presidential elections,  held 12 December 1993, Mile Martic received 60,000 votes less  than Milan Babic. But all those--and there were many--who saw  that as Slobodan Milosevic's defeat in any election proved to be  very wrong. The Election Commission of the RSK [Serbian Republic  Krajina], after an objection from Martic's headquarters, first  nullified the elections in Knin and Benkovac Opcinas, and then  in six other electoral units. Then, when they were repeated on  26 December, it found about 4,000 invalid ballots, so that Babic  received precisely 49.27 percent of the vote and did not become  president.    Simultaneously with the official proclamation of the results  of the first round of the elections, the Election Commission  postponed the second round from 13 to 23 January 1994 without  providing any coherent explanation. It was felt, that is, that  it would take that long for the strategists in Belgrade to work  out a new strategy. That is, it had turned out that pushing  Martic beyond any limit of good taste and the failure to mention  his opponent even in a single word over Radio-TV Serbia had not  borne fruit. The interior minister had concerned himself with  idle Serbianizing and commonplaces, which had departed greatly  from everyday life in Krajina, and therefore did not interest  very many people. The decision was made, then, to sling mud at  Babic and to frighten the Krajina population into thinking that  they would be left to their fate and to the Croats should he be  victorious.    Martic himself began it. He accused his rival of intending  to  take power with a hullabaloo in the media and said that he was  not interested in anything else. He said all that could cause a  situation in Krajina similar to the one in Cazin Krajina, and  that he, disappointed with the methods used by Babic and his  people, would withdraw from the election race unless there were  changes in the makeup of election commissions and voter  committees. The message could not have been stated more  clearly--unless Martic's ultimatums are accepted, the elections  and the transfer of power become uncertain, and a coup d'etat  was certain. If Babic wanted to preserve anything of what he had  achieved in the first round, he had to accept that offer. The  impression that Serbia would give up on Krajina unless its  president was satisfied with the outcome of the elections there  was also intensified by some of the correspondents representing  the government media in Knin. They accused Babic's people of  crimes, separatism aimed against the Srpska republic (joining  Krajina and the Banjaluka region), of treason to the  nationality, of being close to the opposition in Serbia, and so  on. As to how much effect it had, there is a story going around  that Lazar Macura, who, it was thought, would become Babic's  prime minister, felt it on his own skin. On one occasion, he  declared over TV Knin that Dr. Karadzic was traveling around  Krajina and campaigning for Martic and that "as a foreign  national, he ought not to be allowed to do that." After that,  Macura allegedly got on a bus to go from Knin to Belgrade. The  police of the Srpska republic, when they were checking the  identity cards of the passengers, asked him for his passport.  When he said he did not have one, he was taken off the bus as a  "foreign national." He tried to hitchhike back to Knin, but Dr.  Karadzic's zealous police forbid drivers to let him in. He was  allowed to call for a car to come for him from Knin only after  he had waited around the whole night near the checkpoint.    Nevertheless, Krajina felt what media pressure means when at  the beginning of the year Martic's special police occupied all  the TV transmitters and thus prevented operation of TV Knin,  which was inclined toward Babic. At the same time, Serbian  Radio-TV of Krajina, a government institution, was opened in  Plitvice. Relying on tested personnel and equipment from TV Novi  Sad, this television station mainly concerned itself with  various Martic campaign rallies and press releases and passing  on everything that Martic's sponsors had to say about Babic in  Belgrade. The journalist Petko Koprivica (TV Novi Sad) won  particular fame with his statement that "Babic wants unification  of Serbian lands, but according to the lights of Vuk Draskovic,  Vesna Pesic, and Ivan Djuric." There is no need to spell out  that those who were attacked never had the occasion to respond  to that propaganda.    Martic's key statement was that he would like best to be  president of Krajina only five days and then turn over the  office to "Milosevic, president of all the Serbs." A sizable  portion of Krajina citizens interpreted it this way: Who knows  what might happen if Babic returns. The belief that a conflict  with Serbia must not be risked at any price seems to have  prevailed, and thus a miracle occurred in Krajina--Martic's  victory in the second round.  <H5>  The Day After </H5>   There are also explanations to the effect that Babic was  simply told that Belgrade would never accept him as president of  Krajina and that he must in the end reconcile himself to his  loser's fate. Nevertheless, on the day after the elections  Martic is not entirely in the saddle either. Babic's Serbian  Democratic Party [SDS] of Krajina has a majority (30 deputies)  in the RSK parliament. Together with the Radicals, who number  16, possibly reinforced by some of the eight independent  deputies, he is in a position to bring down any candidate for  prime minister Matic proposes. Accordingly, it is possible that  the post of RSK prime minister will be offered to the former  president of Knin Opcina. There are, of course, two conditions:  the first is that Babic "get on the right track," and second  that the Radicals support him. The first is not very likely, and  as matters stand the Krajina Radicals are threatened with a  split. That is, a large number of them never supported Dr.  Vojislav Seselj in his attacks on Slobodan Milosevic during the  Serbian parliamentary election.    The names of Djordje Begovic and Boro Mikelic have been  circulating as possible future prime ministers. The former has  not stood out particularly as prime minister up to now, nor has  anyone particularly reproached him in the showdowns between  Krajina leaders. He is well-known as a neutral figure far  readier to carry out orders than to shape policy. Boro Mikelic  is much more interesting in this case. He emerged in Petrinja  only when Abdic's Western Bosnia Autonomous Province, or rather  its supply corridor through Banija, began to function. Babo from  Velika Kladusa has worked out very elaborate trade with the  Serbs, so that there are grounds for the assumption that  Mikelic, who has been a businessman for many years, has found  business interests. He was also one of Martic's propagandists,  and the latter has often mentioned him as a patriot to be awed.  If things are looked at through the declared intentions of  Belgrade and Zagreb to normalize relations, one of the bridges  to moderating tensions with Krajina might in any case be Mikelic  after the pattern of Abdic. But Martic and Mikelic would be the  last to make decisions about that.  <H5>  The Future </H5>   The joint statement of the Republic of Croatia and the FRY  cast great doubt on Martic's election campaign promises of an  imminent union. Dr. Karadzic's statement that a unified Serbia  must first reach the Una and only afterward the Kupa was also a  cold shower. Although the interpretations of Belgrade and Pale  that this does not signify renunciation of the proclaimed  concept of all Serbs in one state, Krajina political life is  moving more and more toward apathy. It has become evident that  people are tired out by the elections, all the politicking, and  television. Martic's first statement as president after the  elections fitted well into the mindset that Krajina is the last  to make decisions about its destiny. He said over Radio-TV  Serbia that he would gather around him a team of intelligent and  able people from all the Serbian lands--that is, both from  Serbia and from the Srpska republic. When we recall that his  election promises included a strengthening of the police, it is  certain that a paramount objective of his authority will be to  guarantee that orders from Belgrade are carried out. This is  especially important, because power at the opcina level has  mainly been taken over by Babic's Serbian Democratic Party of  Krajina. Likewise, various emissaries from the Srpska republic  are traveling around Krajina and making offers to people who  might want to move into abandoned Muslim and Croatian houses  there on a turnkey basis. For example, Prijedor and Derventa  have been envisaged for people from Plaski.    Finally, what else is one to conclude but that the process  of  a big trade of Krajina has gone pretty far. Martic's job is only  to make that as painless as possible--regardless of whether he  personally is aware of the role intended for him.  <H5>  [Box, p 12] </H5> <H5>  Krajina Mathematics </H5>   First Round of the Presidential Elections in the RSK   Registered voters                      289,866   Voters voting                          236,300   Votes for Milan Babic                  116,014   Votes for Milan Martic                 50,000[.sup]1[/]   Other presidential candidates          70,000[.sup]1[/]   Second Round of the Presidential Elections in the RSK   Registered voters                      295,611   Voters voting                          207,550   Votes for Milan Babic                  97,377   Votes for Milan Martic                 104,234   [.sup]1[/]The figures from other sources fluctuate by approximately 1,000  votes.      The size of the turnout in the second round of the Krajina  presidential elections was 28,750 smaller than in the first  round. Because it is usual for people to abstain in a runoff, we  can assume that it did not affect the final score--especially  because Martic was about 60,000 votes short of Babic in the  first round. It is of interest, however, that the number of  registered voters increased. Their number was 5,745 greater in  the second round. The assumption that in the interval between  the two rounds that number of citizens of Krajina came of age  and that the mortality rate was minimal is not realistic. The  matter is still more interesting when we find that in the second  round Martic had 6,857 votes more than Babic. The inevitable  conclusion is that the Krajina interior minister was given the  necessary number of "dead souls" (inhabitants of Krajina who  have moved away) necessary for victory. When we realize that the  local election commissions and committees were changed to meet  Martic's wishes after his defeat in the first round of the  elections, this was no problem whatsoever.</p>

			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / International Company News: French market watchdog in Eurotunnel inquiry The Commission des Operations de Bourse, the French market watchdog, yesterday launched an official inquiry into whether Eurotunnel, the Channel tunnel operator, fairly presented its financial position in its rights issue prospectus published in May this year. In a letter sent to Mr Patrick Ponsolle, a Eurotunnel director, and released late last night, the COB said it was particularly concerned about the validity of the projections given in the document and the reasons why the company did not report sooner on the financial impact of its delays. The inquiry was triggered by remarks earlier this month by Mr Graham Corbett, Eurotunnel's chief financial officer, who was reported as saying the group had 'no hope' of meeting its profit forecasts made in May. The release of the letter looked set to trigger a row between the COB and Eurotunnel, which last night said it was 'surprised' by the inquiry and 'shocked' that the watchdog had made its contents public. It may also cause a further fall today in the price of Eurotunnel's shares, which dropped sharply after reports of Mr Corbett's comment and have been trading at historic lows in the past few weeks with the release of successive pieces of bad news. The COB also raised concerns about the way in which Mr Corbett communicated his doubts through the press rather than by an official statement, which it said was more serious given that Eurotunnel is quoted in both London and Paris. Eurotunnel said it would co-operate fully with the COB, but stressed that the projections given in the prospectus were always illustrative and subject to change.

			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / National Savings makes steep rate cuts NATIONAL Savings yesterday announced sharp cuts in the interest it offers on fixed-rate savings products. The cuts varied between 0.75 percentage points and a full point. The Building Societies Association said the reductions, which take effect over the next fortnight, would ease pressure further on mortgage rates. Meanwhile, Halifax Building Society, the largest mortgage lender, signalled it was looking for high-value low-risk customers in the housing market as it and Woolwich, the third largest, cut their basic mortgage interest rates to 9.99 per cent. Halifax's cuts mean many of its mortgages are now slightly more expensive than those of Abbey National, its main market rival, which last week cut its rate to 9.95 per cent. However, Halifax has structured its charges to ensure that it undercuts Abbey National for some very large loans. The Halifax and Woolwich cuts apply immediately to new customers and from November 1 for existing borrowers. National Savings' launch in July of its First Option Bond, which offers a fixed rate over one year with tax paid, brought protests from building societies, which said it was impossible to match. The initial rate of 10.34 per cent gross was soon cut to 9.67 per cent and it has now been reduced to 8.67 per cent. Similar cuts were made yesterday to National Savings' more traditional products, and the new 39th Issue Savings Certificates will be sold in units of Pounds 100 rather than units of Pounds 25.</p>

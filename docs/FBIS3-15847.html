			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Slavyanka" program of the Russian Defense </F> Ministry]    [Text] Russia's ground forces remain the basis of Russia's  Army. However, the outlook for their development is unclear.  That is how Colonel General Vladimir Semenov, commander in  chief of ground forces, has described the present position of  the units and subunits in his charge. According to him they do  not possess at present even the minimum means for further  development. The commander in chief is particularly concerned  about the residual principle of providing personnel for the  ground forces. In Vladimir Semenov's opinion the ground forces  must in the longer term become mobile, well managed, and able to  carry out any assignment.</p>

			<p><P> June 22, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WOMAN STABBED TO DEATH WITH KITCHEN KNIFE;  </P> <P> MAN CONVICTED IN WIFE'S MURDER  </P> <P> A Glendale man on trial in the stabbing death of his wife was convicted of  second-degree murder this week by a Pasadena Superior Court judge.  </P> <P> Haro Agakian, 40, was found guilty of stabbing his wife, Judy Agakian, 37, with  a kitchen knife in the master bedroom of their apartment in the 300 block of  North Isabel Street on March 16, 1988.  </P> <P> Judge Terry Smerling heard the case after Agakian waived his right to a jury  trial.  </P> <P> The prosecution and defense agreed that Agakian stabbed his wife after a bitter  argument. But at issue in the much-delayed, five-week trial was whether the  killing was premeditated. Deputy Dist. Atty. Donna L. Wills had asked the judge  for a first-degree murder conviction, arguing that the killing was planned.  Defense attorney Bradley W. Brunon had argued for a verdict of voluntary  manslaughter.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Defendant's Wounds  </P> <P> Wills sought to prove that Agakian brought two serrated kitchen knives to the  third-floor bedroom with the intention of killing his wife and then himself.  Agakian suffered six superficial stab wounds to his chest.  </P> <P> Wills argued at the trial that Agakian killed his wife in anger over their  pending divorce. Wills said Agakian had discovered in February that Judy  Agakian was having an affair. They filed for divorce but continued sharing the  apartment, sleeping in separate bedrooms. Wills said Agakian was distressed  that she was looking forward to the divorce.  </P> <P> Despite the defense stipulation that Agakian had stabbed his wife, Agakian  testified that he does not remember the events of that night and whether he did  so was "anybody's guess."  </P> <P> Brunon said that his client's chest wounds were inflicted by Judy Agakian and  that Agakian then "lost control and in a fit of anger stabbed his wife to  death."  </P> <P> In returning the second-degree murder verdict, Smerling said he was convinced  that the killing was murder rather than manslaughter but he remained  unconvinced that Agakian had planned his wife's death.  </P> <P> Agakian is being held in Los Angeles County Jail. A sentencing hearing is  scheduled July 28. He faces a maximum sentence of 16 years to life in prison.  </P></p>

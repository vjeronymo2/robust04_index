The undertaking was given by Baroness Thatcher, the then prime minister. In 1988 she personally negotiated the sale of Pounds 1bn worth of arms with Mr Mahatir Mohamad, the Malaysian prime minister, during a visit to Kuala Lumpur. The aid package was announced within weeks of the military deal and both were discussed in the talks between the two leaders. Labour has long argued that the price for the arms sales, which included 12 Tornado ground attack aircraft, was the promise of assistance for the Pergau project. Last night Mr Cunningham said: 'Mr Hurd appears to have clearly breached his fiduciary duty over a very large amount of taxpayers' money.

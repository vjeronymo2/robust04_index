			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Irina Zolotaryova and Natalia </F> Cherepanova]    [Text] St. Petersburg March 21 TASS -- St. Petersburg's  public prosecutor filed a protest against city mayor Anatoliy  Sobchak's decision to extend the voting in the city council  elections for another 24 hours.    The duration of the voting is determined by Article 33 of  the  regulations on elections to the legislative bodies of power in  regions, territories, cities with federal status, autonomous  regions and autonomous territories approved by a presidential  decree of October 27, 1993. The mayor has no right to change  the duration of voting, a statement issued by the public  prosecutor said.    Ten out of 16 registered electoral associations adopted a  joint declaration on Monday denouncing Sobchak's decision as a  "wrong move" and suggesting holding new elections on April 17  with the same list of candidates. A Russian central Electoral  Commission official said earlier today that Sobchak's decision  is a "case which requires juridical examination."    Yuriy Orlov, head of the legal department of the Central  Electoral Commission, said that there is no direct ban on such  extension in the standing legislation. But this is the first  such case and it "creates a precedent" which must be studied by  the Central Electoral Commission.    Under the Russian Constitution, St. Petersburg is a subject  of the federation that has the right to establish its own voting  procedures and rules which, however, should not run counter to  the regulations approved by the president, Orlov explained.    He said that his department is now working out a draft law  on  basic franchise guarantees in the Russian Federation. It will  include proposals made by regional electoral commissions,  political parties and associations aimed at improving the  electoral law. In it "we will try to provide for such cases and  other unexpected situations which may arise during the election  campaign," Orlov said.</p>

			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Slow growth curbs price rises in Spain SPAIN'S inflation rate fell marginally in 1992 to 5.4 per cent, from 5.5 per cent in 1991. This was a considerable improvement on government forecasts early last year of 6.4 per cent rise in the consumer price index by December. Underlying inflation, which excludes the volatile energy and non-processed food prices, rose by just 0.2 percentage points last month, the lowest monthly rise of 1992, to give a rate for the year of 6.9 per cent. The figures, published yesterday by the government's statistics institute, reflected the depressed state of the domestic economy. Independent economists estimate zero growth in the last quarter of last year and growth of about 1 per cent overall in 1992. Mr Jose Luis Feito, chief analyst of the Madrid securities firm of Asesosores Bursatlies, said the downward trend in prices would continue in coming months. There was unlikely to be any meaningful easing of interest rates soon. Lower inflation appears likely following a recommendation by the employers' federation to hold salary increases this year below 3 per cent. The government has already taken the lead on wage moderation by fixing the increase of the minimum wage at just 4 per cent, the lowest annual increase for a decade, and in effect freezing wage increases in the public sector. The government's employment agency meanwhile reported that the number of registered job seekers rose last month to 2.36m, up by 31,000 on December 1991.</p>

			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / UK News (Employment): BP Exploration staff to assess managers' work BP EXPLORATION, the oil and gas drilling company, has begun to assess managers according to the views of the staff working for them. Such 'upward appraisal' of managers will eventually become one of the factors in setting their pay. Staff have been asked to fill in detailed questionnaires on their managers' performance, rating them on a scale of one to five under several headings. The scheme is one of the first in Britain allowing staff to assess managers. The appraisals are in their first year of operation. They are not yet linked to the pay of BP Exploration's 2,000 managers and supervisors but the company believes they will be. The 'upward feedback' scheme is unusual because most appraisal systems operate downwards. Mr Doug Webb, the company's human resources manager, said he knew of only five or six organisations in the world operating such a system. In Britain, W. H. Smith Retail introduced a pilot upward assessment scheme last year. International Business Machines also asks employees about their managers as part of a wider staff attitudes survey, although the results do not feed formally into the appraisal system. Experimentation with appraisal at BP Exploration is part of sweeping changes in performance management in the BP group. Attempts are under way to introduce a set of 'essential behaviours' such as innovative thinking and team building throughout the group. The company's new scheme, to run from October each year, uses the external London-based consultancy Forum Europe. Staff are given questionnaires listing 23 different management 'practices' which they are asked to rank on a scale of one to five. Examples of practices are: 'accurately representing the views, opinions and feelings of staff up the line'; 'willingness to share power in the interest of common goals'; and 'maintaining high standards for the unit's work'. Staff are then asked to rate, on the same scale, how well their managers or supervisors have applied them. The same rating process is applied to BP's overall list of 'essential behaviours'. Individual responses are confidential and results are aggregated by the outside consultants, who then go through the findings with each manager. Meetings are set up between managers and staff to help the manager to develop an action plan for improvement. The action plan is then discussed with the manager's boss and can be incorporated into objectives for the coming year.</p>

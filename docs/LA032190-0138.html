			<p><P> March 21, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAXICARE SAYS ENROLLMENTS DOWN 50% IN YEAR;  </P> <P> INSURANCE: THE FIRM, WHICH SOUGHT BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION IN 1989, ALSO SAYS  REVISED FIGURES FOR '88 SHOW ITS LOSS WAS $611.8 MILLION.  </P> <P> Maxicare Health Plans has lost half of its enrollment since filing for Chapter  11 bankruptcy protection a year ago. Enrollment declined to about 320,000 from  about 650,000 enrolled last March, the company said Tuesday.  </P> <P> The company also revised its 1988 annual loss from the previously reported  $267.8 million to $611.8 million.  </P> <P> The figures compare membership in the health maintenance organizations that the  Los Angeles-based company decided it wanted to keep after emerging from Chapter  11 proceedings. Overall, Maxicare began last year with more than 1 million  members, but it sold or closed several plans as part of its efforts to  reorganize into a financially healthier company.  </P> <P> Maxicare spokesman Jim Lucas said the company lost about a third of its  enrollment in the first three months after the Chapter 11 filing. It lost  another 50,000 or so members during the open enrollment season between last  September and Jan. 31, he said.  </P> <P> Maxicare began an aggressive advertising campaign in November designed to  persuade members to stay with the plan and used the bankruptcy proceedings to  force companies that wanted to drop the plan to offer it again to members.  </P> <P> Despite the drop in membership, Maxicare Chairman and Chief Executive Peter J.  Ratican said in an interview that the company is still a relatively large one  in the industry. The drop in enrollment has not been a major problem and in  fact "may have improved our services," he said, adding, "The system is working  at maximum efficiency."  </P> <P> The revised loss figures for 1988 were contained in a disclosure statement the  company filed with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Santa Ana on the first  anniversary of the March 16, 1989, bankruptcy filing. They were audited  results, while the figures reported shortly after the bankruptcy filing last  year were unaudited, the company said.  </P> <P> In the first nine months of 1989, unaudited figures filed in the same  disclosure statement showed a net loss of $22.3 million on revenue of $412.3  million. Revenue in 1988 was $1.6 billion (audited), Maxicare said.  </P> <P> Ratican said the company is optimistic despite the financial losses and drop in  enrollment. "We believe that 1990 is a year when we'll show profitable  numbers," he said. "We are moving steadily toward our goal of emerging from  reorganization in 1990 as a financially strong competitor," he added.  </P> <P> Most of the 1988 losses were incurred by health maintenance organizations the  company either sold or closed, Maxicare said. Losses during 1989 were due  primarily to the expense of the Chapter 11 reorganization and to overhead cost  that the company was unable to cut as fast as the decline in revenue, Lucas  said. He said the company had to keep some staff members to take care of  service commitments it retained even after it closed or sold some plans.  </P> <P> The company in January finally reduced its corporate staff to about 640 people.  The positive effect of those cuts should be reflected in 1990 results, Ratican  said.  </P> <P> He said about $11 million of the 1989 loss was attributed to legal expenses  from the Chapter 11 proceedings, and the company had some writedowns. The  company, however, has a positive cash flow, Ratican said. "We have been cash  flow positive since March of 1989," he said.  </P> <P> The bankruptcy filing suspended Maxicare debts prior to that date, but Ratican  said Maxicare has since paid current bills on time. He said health-care  providers are being paid within 10 days of billing.  </P> <P> Maxicare in January announced a reorganization plan that would result in  health-care providers owning about 40% of the reorganized company. Under the  plan, formally filed with the court along with the disclosure statements,  creditors overall would own about 98% of the 10 million new shares the company  plans to issue when the reorganization plan is approved. Doctors, hospitals and  banks would also receive cash and 10 year, 13.5% notes. Bondholders would  receive cash and stock.  </P> <P> A hearing on the plan is scheduled for April 23. Maxicare said Tuesday that the  creditors committee that initially reacted favorably to the plan has now  decided to recommend its approval.  </P></p>

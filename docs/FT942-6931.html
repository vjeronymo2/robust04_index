			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Acatos up 9% despite squeeze on margins A rise of more than 50 per cent in the average price of edible oils over the last 18 months has put increasing pressure on margins at Acatos &amp; Hutcheson, the edible oils and fats manufacturing group. For the six months to April 3 the group achieved a 9 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 5.59m (Pounds 5.14m) on turnover ahead 17 per cent at Pounds 123.1m (Pounds 105m). The bulk of the group's business lies in supplying own brand oils and fats to UK supermarkets. Mr Ian Hutcheson, chairman, said the insistence of some of the group's customers that prices should be held 'in the face of unavoidable cost increases reached a level of unrealism we have not previously experienced'. Nevertheless, Acatos had managed to maintain its market share. Earnings per share rose to 11.4p (10.4p). The interim dividend is lifted to 3.5p (3p). Last November the group announced that it would be closing its edible oils refinery at Bootle, Merseyside. Yesterday the group said that the 250-strong workforce had been guaranteed employment to the end of December, and would work on dismantling and decommissioning the plant when it shuts later this year. Mr Hutcheson said that the full benefit of the closure would not be felt until the next financial year. Meanwhile, a planned reconstruction of the shareholding of Acatos Limited in the company has been put on hold. Acatos Limited is private and owns the shares previously held by Mr Hutcheson, his family and other parties, which comprise 37.1 per cent of the ordinary capital.</p>

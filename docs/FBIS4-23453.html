			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Stephen Smith: "The Mysteries of Goma, Zairian </F> Refuge of Rwandan Killers"]    [Excerpt] Goma -- The 3.2-km-long runway at Goma airport is  in great demand. First, it is a way out of the enclave of the  North Kivu province, Zaire's own veritable vegetable garden.  Then, because of the cargoes of manioc, yam, and beans, but  also because of its passenger traffic, it maintains the national  unity of a country-continent whose road and rail networks exists  only on a map. At the end of the runway, between two planes, the  youngsters have a soccer field which, despite the torrential  rain, manages to remain unflooded for three-quarters of the  year. Lastly, since the start of the Rwandan crisis, Goma  airport has been the rear base of the government of neighboring  Rwanda. It was from here that the leaders of the genocide were,  until 10 days ago, kept supplied, notably with weapons.    Since the defeat of the Rwandan Armed Forces in Kigali on  Sunday, 22 May, the "special flights" to Goma have stopped.  Previously, a Boeing 707 with the registration number carefully  wiped out would land at the airport five times daily, three  times by day and twice at night. Its cargo each time was 18  tonnes of weapons and munitions -- "from Serbia," some people  said, while others claimed the cargo was shipped in crates  stamped "Bulgaria." At least once witnesses claim to have seen  South African pilots. Despite the abundance of details and  sometimes contradictory versions, all the sources on the ground,  including well-placed French expatriates, say that they are  "certain" that these arms deliveries had been "paid for by  France." However, no one is able to provide any evidence to  back up this conviction.    When he recently received in Paris Faustin Twagiramungu, the  prime minister-designate of a future Rwandan "government of  national union," French Cooperation Minister Michel Roussin came  out against such accusations. He challenged his accuser to come  up with proof. The defense attache of a French Embassy in the  region also explained: "After having categorically turned down  a request for military aid in mid-April, I cannot see the  Balladur government sending weapons to Goma where, moreover,  everything ends up being common knowledge." He added:  "However, secret aid, by parallel circuits, is always possible.  You know, I could tell you about arms agencies in Paris..."    Official France? Parallel France? Whether or not there has  been French-Zairian collaboration in the Rwandan crisis, the  fact remains that, thanks to the murderous conflagration in the  neighboring country, Marshal-President Mobutu is remembered  fondly in Paris. A French official said: "If Mobutu had been  in the same plane as Juvenal Habyarimana," the Rwandan president  killed in the attack on his plane on 6 April, "the whole of  Africa would be ablaze and awash with blood." Apart from his  "stabilizing role in the region," Paris has rediscovered the  "French-speaking fidelity" of the Zairian leader, who  nevertheless is still denied a visa for France and who has  recently been threatened with the seizure of "all his ill-gotten  gains acquired" abroad. "There is no longer any question of  that," they say today. "We need Mobutu to keep Zaire steady and  to confront Yoweri Museveni," the Ugandan president. Museveni  is perceived as the Trojan Horse of "Anglo-Saxon interests in  the region." One measure of the reconciliation is Francois  Mitterrand's personal invitation to Mobutu to attend the next  French-African summit in November in Biarritz, which has already  been sent to the French Embassy in Kinshasa. "As soon as Mobutu  forms a government and agrees to a few concessions, such as  relinquishing control of the Bank of Zaire, it will be forwarded  to him as a demonstration of gratitude."

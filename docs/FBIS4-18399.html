			<p>BFN     [Text] Bavarian plans to deport militant Kurds to Turkey  are not supported by Federal Justice Minister  Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger. As long as there is even the  slightest danger that the affected people will be threatened by  torture and death, they must not be deported, she stated in  Bonn. The minister pointed out that many Kurds have been  recognized as asylum-seekers, and that, within the framework of  the negotiations on the asylum compromise, Turkey was regarded  by all parties as an unsafe country of origin.</p>

			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / Observer: Strike out The Clinton administration has carefully avoided getting sucked into the rancorous negotiations over the three week old strike that has shut down big league baseball in the US. But one administration official is really fretting: William B. Gould IV, chairman of the National Labor Relations Board. A certified Boston Red Sox fanatic, Gould has contributed almost as many paeans to the Sox on the sports pages as he has penned scholarly articles on labour law. Indeed, given his background he would would seem to be just the person to sort out the strike before it spills over into the 1995 season. However, the NLRB can only get involved in unfair labour practice complaints and in unionisation ballots. Still, Gould can take some comfort from the fact that when play stopped last month his beloved Red Sox attained second to bottom place in their division. Perhaps Gould would do well to write the season off.</p>

			<p>920203 FT  03 FEB 92 / Management: Efficiency gains are on the cards Every employee at Elida Gibbs, the Unilever subsidiary that produces bathroom brands such as Timotei, Pears and Signal, carries two cards. The first lists company goals for growth, customer service, employee training, and improvements in efficiency. The second card carries the Freephone number for a confidential helpline. Employees can ring and, if necessary, arrange counselling on drink, debt, legal or perhaps marital problems. There is a connection between the two cards, according to Jon Riches, Elida Gibbs' personnel director: improving efficiency means cutting down on waste and that means cutting down on absenteeism. The expectation is that the counselling service will help to reduce high absenteeism among the company's 700 blue-collar workers. Riches says a cut in the current 8 per cent rate to nearer the national average of around 5 per cent, would pay for the counselling service several times over. The Pounds 25 a head cost of the helpline is made up of a management fee to an external counselling company, plus a charge for every consultation. The use of independent counsellors - in this case the Hertfordshire-based group Focus - is seen by Riches as an essential feature of the scheme. Line managers have a coaching and counselling role but cannot be expected to have the specialist skills needed to deal with, say, a drug addiction problem, he says. In addition, some issues are private - and employees are bound to believe that revealing their worries to their manager, or even to someone from the personnel department, will affect job prospects. When the company rationalised its production sites and opened a purpose-built factory at Seacroft on the outskirts of Leeds, it drew much of its workforce from surrounding council estates. Three-quarters of the workforce is female, some of them single parents. This dual role may mean they have to decide priorities - dealing with a sick child or going to work, Riches says. One of the reasons the factory has attracted a high number of female workers is because of its 15-hour day, divided into three shifts. Women with domestic responsibilities find the five-hour shifts fit in better with childcare than the conventional seven-and-a-half-hour day. So do women have different reasons for using the helpline than a predominantly male or mixed workforce? Graham Pitts from Focus says not: apart from fewer problems related to alcohol, the range of calls is similar to that found in other client companies. Frequency of use is also likely to be similar with about 6 per cent of employees calling the helpline over the year. It is too early to say whether the scheme will translate into lower absenteeism or - less tangible - increases in employee 'empowerment', as the company calls it. For Riches is not only looking at the size of the pile of sick notes, he is also hoping the scheme will fit in with Total Quality developments and the gradual introduction of self-managing working groups. As Riches puts it: 'Susie has to have the courage to stop the line when she sees that something's not right. In the traditional way of working, that would be a disciplinary offence.' It is hoped that counselling, including advice on work-related matters, will speed these developments. Unilever's 20 other companies, covering 35,000 UK employees, are watching Elida Gibbs' progress closely and could introduce counselling programmes themselves. Overall, Pitts calculates that perhaps only 50 to 70 companies in the UK are using independent counsellors - or employee assistance programmes (EAPs). EAPs are barely more developed elsewhere in Europe but, if experience in the US is anything to go by, Elida Gibbs and a handful of other companies could be pioneering a trend. Focus points to the fact that more than 75 per cent of the US Fortune top 500 companies now have EAPs. Return on investment in the US is said to vary from Dollars 2 to Dollars 16 for every Dollars 1 spent.</p>

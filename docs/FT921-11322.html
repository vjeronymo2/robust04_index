			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Superpowers move the winning post: The arms race may have gone into reverse, but more nations think they need a nuclear deterrent The nuclear arms race, as we knew it, between the superpowers is no more. In fact, it has gone into reverse. This renders obsolete the process of arms control as we knew it, since that was concerned essentially with regulating the arms race. Arms control started from the assumption that there were two superpowers, mutually hostile and suspicious, whose only common interest lay in avoiding the destruction or irremediable pollution of the planet on which both were obliged, until further notice, to live. Only in 1987, with the Intermediate Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty, did arms control produce an agreement requiring the actual destruction of existing weapons: in fact, of an entire category of missiles. What made that possible was the discovery made by the Soviet Union, when it found the arms race running beyond what its economy could sustain, that security is not a zero-sum game. Mr Mikhail Gorbachev recognised that the Soviet Union's security problems were at least partly of its own making, since its military preparations had made Nato countries feel insecure and prompted them to respond in kind. This discovery reversed the assumption which drives all arms races, namely that whatever one side does to increase its own security makes it easier for it to contemplate an attack on the other. Followed to its logical conclusion, Mr Gorbachev's discovery makes arms control unnecessary: if each side realises that it can best enhance its own security by dismantling those weapons which most threaten the other, then it will do so without having to be constrained by detailed agreements. All it needs is a general conviction that the other side has got the message and is behaving similarly. In the end the very concept of 'sides' becomes irrelevant. That is precisely what is now happening. The upward spiral in nuclear weapons has been replaced by a downward one. It has not yet gone down to the point where smaller nuclear powers like the UK and France are obliged to join in. Their forces, as Russian President Boris Yeltsin admitted after a tutorial on the subject at 10 Downing Street on Thursday, are still 'not comparable' with those of the superpowers. But Mr Yeltsin was perhaps too generous in adding that 'therefore the matter is not really worth any discussion'. There is already discussion in Washington, no longer regarded as purely academic, about the floor level at which US nuclear weapons should ultimately be stabilised. In this discussion it is assumed that Russia is now willing to match any cuts that the US decides on. Therefore the size of other countries' forces become a relevant consideration. One school of thought holds that the US should not allow its arsenal to fall below 5,000 warheads, on the grounds that it must, in order to maintain its superpower status, have a larger number than Britain, France and China combined. Every nuclear power is obliged to rethink its position in this new strategic context. What does it have nuclear weapons for? How many does it need, and of what type? How many nuclear powers will there be, and what kind of threat will they pose? Probably no political or military leader, since General Douglas MacArthur in the Korean war, has wanted actually to fire nuclear weapons at an enemy. Their usefulness, if any, is as a deterrent. The 'war-fighting strategies' which caused so much alarm in the early 1980s were not expressions of desire or intent. They were contingency plans, designed to make nuclear deterrence more credible - the theory being that the adversary will not be deterred unless he believes the danger of nuclear retaliation is real; that he will not believe so unless the putative retaliator has a credible plan of retaliation; and that no such plan is credible unless it provides for the survival, in some shape or form, of the society on whose behalf it is made. Even Iraqi President Saddam Hussein is unlikely to have been developing nuclear weapons with a positive determination to use them. It is now known that, in the late 1970s, he took trouble to procure and study the writings of General Andre Gallois, theoretician of France's nuclear force de frappe. The essence of General Gallois's theory is that possession of nuclear weapons enables a state to make its national territory an invulnerable 'sanctuary', which no one will dare to attack. Mr Saddam probably hoped to achieve this for Iraq, thereby enabling him to wage conventional war against his neighbours at relatively low risk. It is fortunate for those neighbours that in the end he found himself unable to wait until his nuclear umbrella was in place before launching his attack on Kuwait. The example of Saddam Hussein is useful because it illustrates both the reasons why a state may wish to deploy nuclear weapons, even though it has no desire to use them. It may want to deter an attack on its own territory by superior conventional forces; or it may want to counteract the advantage gained by another state which has nuclear weapons. Whatever Mr Saddam's real intentions, his public justification for having a nuclear programme - a valid one in the eyes of the Arab public - is that Israel should not be allowed a nuclear monopoly in the Middle East. Again, this does not mean that Arabs generally believe Israel would use nuclear weapons against them for the fun of it, so to speak. No matter how callous one imagines the Israelis could be, it is clear that they could expect no positive benefit from nuclear war. But the fact that Israel is universally believed (despite its occasional pro forma denials) to have nuclear weapons does put it at an advantage vis-a-vis the Arabs in conventional war, and hence also in diplomacy. Israelis would see that as necessary to ensure their survival, given Arab numerical superiority. But Arabs see it as enabling Israel to humiliate them, notably by holding on to occupied territory, with impunity. No state likes to be at that kind of disadvantage in a dispute with its neighbour. Now consider the case of western Europe. The historic justification for having nuclear weapons there has been the need to deter an attack by superior conventional forces, specifically those of the Soviet Union. This applied to Nato, and also to France's independent strike force. Nato's 'flexible response' doctrine meant, in essence, that it sought always to maintain a credible option of nuclear retaliation if its conventional forces seemed about to be overfore Nato always firmly rejected suggestions that it should make any kind of pledge, even a reciprocal one, not to be the first to use nuclear weapons, replying simply that it would not be the aggressor. France disliked 'flexible response', not because it implied being the first to use nuclear weapons but, on the contrary, because it implied that a nuclear war might be survivable. While Nato strategy sought to make the nuclear deterrent more credible by limiting its initial impact, French strategy sought to make it more awesome by stressing its apocalyptic character. It was based on a simple syllogism: nuclear war is unthinkable; any war in Europe will be a nuclear one; ergo, war in Europe is unthinkable. Thus French literature on the subject tends almost to deify nuclear weapons as a phenomenon which has saved Europe from the demons of war which so ravaged it in the past. That was broadly also the view of Mrs Margaret Thatcher, although less dithyrambically expressed. The Americans were always more ambivalent on the subject, since for them the proposition that Armageddon was worth risking to avoid conventional defeat in Europe had less obvious attractions. A non-nuclear world was one they could more comfortably contemplate. Indeed, President Ronald Reagan proclaimed it as his objective when he launched his Strategic Defence Initiative (SDI), and came close to agreeing on it with Mr Gorbachev at Reykjavik in 1986. Now that the Soviet Union has disintegrated, and the fear of Russian conventional forces overrunning western Europe has vanished, it has become much harder for Nato to justify retaining an option to use nuclear weapons first. Nato's New Strategic Concept, published at last November's Rome summit, does still assert that nuclear weapons 'demonstrate that aggression of any kind is not a rational option', and that they are therefore 'essential to preserve peace'. But those words were included at French, and to a lesser extent British, insistence. UK politicians, unlike the French, have tended to explain their national deterrent as a necessary response to the existence of other nuclear powers, rather than as something good in itself. In the post-Cold War world, superior conventional force is no longer the main threat that west Europeans have to worry about. But it may still be the main threat for Israel; for some of the ex-Soviet republics, such as Armenia (which may fear invasion from Turkey), or Kazakhstan and Ukraine (whose fears are directed at Russia); and for any number of third world states. The temptation for these states to emulate France, hoping that nuclear weapons will make their national territory invulnerable, is likely to be strong whether or not they themselves harbour any aggressive intent towards their neighbours. For Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine - republics on whose territory parts of the Soviet strategic arsenal are located - this question is an immediate one. Belarus and Ukraine, traumatised by the Chernobyl disaster, seem for the moment eager to do without their own nuclear deterrent: they have committed themselves to signing the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) as non-nuclear weapons states. But that position could change if the fragile Commonwealth of Independent States, with its cumbersome arrangement for joint control of strategic forces, falls apart. Kazakhstan in any case is taking a more cautious line. Its leaders have talked of retaining strategic weapons on their territory until the year 2000. Meanwhile, thousands of ex-Soviet nuclear technicians are reputedly looking for jobs abroad, and it is almost inevitable that some of them will end up in the service of would-be nuclear powers in the third world. It is this process of nuclear proliferation, rather than any conventional threat, which is now most worrying for Nato countries. France implicitly recognised that when it agreed to sign the NPT last year, reversing a long- held national position. Doing so does not require France to renounce its own nuclear deterrent, since it is one of the five states which qualify as nuclear weapons states under the treaty, having exploded a nuclear device before January 1 1967. But there is an apparent contradiction between the logic of the NPT and the French, or indeed the Nato, doctrine, that nuclear weapons are essential to deter aggression and preserve peace. Why, the would-be proliferator can reasonably ask, do some states require their own national deterrent for these purposes, while others are expected either to seek a nuclear guarantee from their allies or (if that is not available, or comes at an unacceptable political price) simply to rely on some vague notion of collective security and 'new world order'. As they seek to maintain and strengthen the NPT (which comes up for renewal in 1995) and to persuade new states to adhere to it, the five recognised nuclear weapons states are likely to find that question more and more difficult to elude.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- THE NUCLEAR ARRAY  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       Number of warheads in arsenals of declared                       nuclear powers  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                               US     CIS     UK     France     China  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Intercontinental   ballistic missiles       2,450   6,600      -          -       40?  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Submarine-launched   ballistic missiles       5,200   3,600    100        400       30?  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Aircraft bombs and   missiles                 8,300   5,400+   200        120      200+  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Other land-based   missiles, shells         2,840   5,000+     -         90      100?  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Other sea-launched   missiles and torpedoes     350   1,500      -          -         -  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Surface-to-air missiles        -   3,300      -          -         -  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: SIPRI, IISS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

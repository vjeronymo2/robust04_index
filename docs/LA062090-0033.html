			<p><P> June 20, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> BOARD RECEIVES PLAN TO CUT TRAFFIC  </P> <P> A consultant's report recommending ways in which Ventura County can cut down on  the commuter traffic of 6,000 county employees was accepted by the Board of  Supervisors Tuesday.  </P> <P> But the board stopped short of implementing any of the 18 suggestions in the  car-pooling plan.  </P> <P> Instead, it ordered the heads of county agencies to report back next week on  how the plan could be implemented at work sites countywide.  </P> <P> The Applied Management and Planning Group of Los Angeles provided the  supervisors with a list of suggestions.  </P> <P> They include:  </P> <P> * Guaranteeing a ride home for car-poolers who work late and for personal  emergencies;  </P> <P> * Providing lockers and shower facilities to those who jog or bicycle to work;  </P> <P> * Allowing employees to work at home;  </P> <P> * Allocating preferential car-pool parking spaces.  </P> <P> County supervisors have until July 1 to prepare a report for the Air Pollution  Control District in which they outline a specific plan to reduce pollution by  lessening traffic.  </P> <P> According to the planning group, implementing all of the strategies would  reduce solo commuting by 24%, and the county estimates it would cost up to $1  million.  </P> <P> Dr. Peter Stopher, who headed the team that prepared the report, said shifting  to a workweek of four 10-hour days or condensing 80 hours of work into nine  days has met with very favorable reviews from county employees in a pilot  program.  </P> <P> "The employees like it because they only work a couple more hours per day and  then get a full-day vacation," he said. "It's good for the public because the  government offices would be open two extra hours per day and are therefore more  accessible. And just think, if everyone did this, traffic would be reduced by  20%." MAYA RADEVICH  </P></p>

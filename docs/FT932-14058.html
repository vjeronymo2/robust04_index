			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / Pakistan to review Sharif commitments PAKISTAN'S new government, which has taken power following the dismissal of the administration of Mr Nawaz Sharif, yesterday pledged to honour the country's international financial commitments. However, the new administration promised to examine Mr Sharif's extensive public spending plans with a view to reducing public borrowing. Diplomats took this to mean the government would honour existing contracts for road-building and other projects but that future schemes could be delayed, or in some cases scrapped. Mr Sharif's government was sacked on Sunday and the national assembly dissolved by President Ghulam Ishaq Khan after a protracted power struggle. Among the charges levelled by Mr Ishaq Khan were economic mismanagement, including corruption and overspending. Mr Farooq Leghari, the newly-appointed finance minister, said that 'all contractual obligations shall be met' in response to questions about infrastructure projects which were a central feature of Mr Sharif's government. But he added: 'We will go into a much greater degree of financial discipline.' The new government is faced with a budget deficit for the year to the end of June which private sector economists estimate will be 7-8 per cent of national output. The new administration will seek an increase in foreign development aid to Pakistan. Officials this week postponed a meeting with donor organisations in Paris this week, pleading for time to review the economy and public spending. Diplomats in Islamabad said yesterday the meeting was now unlikely to be held until after elections which Mr Ishaq Khan plans to hold in July. However, the election may be delayed by a suit, filed in Lahore High Court, contesting the legality of the president's dismissal of Mr Sharif's government and the national assembly. The new government promised not to reverse Mr Sharif's widely-praised economic liberalisation programme, which included privatisation, customs duty cuts, and foreign exchange deregulation. Mr Leghari said: 'Market-oriented concepts will continue to apply. We will continue to work towards further liberalisation of the economic system and we are going to work towards even greater deregulation.' The government is trying to form a multi-party cabinet to support its claim that it represents a wide range of national interests. Mr Balakh Sher Mazari, the new prime minister, comes from the Pakistan Moslem League, Mr Sharif's party, and Mr Leghari is a member of the opposition Pakistan People's party led by Ms Benazir Bhutto.</p>

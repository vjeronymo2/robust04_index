			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Ali Alatas says the decision to  repatriate Vietnamese refugees from Galang Island is not  Indonesia's wish but is based on international consensus.  Speaking at the end of a coordinated meeting for politics and  security affairs in Jakarta yesterday, Alatas said Indonesia is  only implementing several resolutions adopted at international  forums. He also cited a comprehensive plan by the International  Conference on Indochinese Refugees, ICIR, on the repatriation of  Vietnamese refugees to their country of origin.    Only about 8,000 Vietnamese refugees currently held at  Galang  Island want to seek political asylum in a third country, while  the majority who left for economic reasons must return to  Vietnam. Alatas also said that the ICIR places special emphasis  on screening Vietnamese refugees who really want to be resettled  in a third country.</p>

			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Albania offers onshore exploration blocks ALBANIA IS extending its oil and natural gas exploration programme to onshore areas, offering concessions in six blocks covering 700 square km along the country's Adriatic coastline. In a separate project, international oil companies are being invited to submit bids for a Dollars 70m recovery enhancement programme at existing oilfields in southern Albania. The offers mark a reversal of previous Albanian policy on oil exploration, which restricted foreign companies to offshore drilling. The government is now trying to attract large-scale investment from abroad to help modernise the country's crumbling industrial base. Following completion of seismic testing last year, five international oil companies are due to start offshore drilling in the Adriatic this summer. However, there have been considerable administrative delays caused by uncertainty over Albania's legal framework for investment. Mr Albert Isai of Albpetrol, the state oil company, said that the tender offer for onshore concessions was prepared in partnership with Western Geophysical, the US-based surveying company, which re-processed data provided by Albanian geologists. He said seven international companies had so far shown interest in onshore exploration. Bids are due by June 15. The onshore contracts, expected to have a 25-year duration, foresee a five-year research and exploration period, with on-site training to be provided for Albanian technical staff. Under a production-sharing agreement, capital expenditures would be recovered over five years. Up to 40 per cent of yearly crude oil production would be payable for cost recovery, while profit sharing would be negotiable, Mr Isai said. Natural gas discoveries would remain the property of the Albanian state. The government hopes that Albania will be linked with a planned gas pipeline from Skopje in Macedonia and another under construction in northern Greece. Both would supply Russian natural gas. The recovery enhancement project covers oilfields at Divjaka, Povelca and Ballaj where total production of crude has declined to around 800,000 tonnes a year from more than 2m tonnes a year in the late 1970s. Albpetrol invited bids in the form of joint ventures, production sharing or service contracts, specifying that local staff and services should be used wherever possible. The three-year project would probably involve new drilling 'for exploitation not exploration' and use of new technology, such as steam injection techniques, to increase oil yields, Mr Isai said. 'Production has been steadily declining. We are using antiquated Russian, Chinese and Romanian equipment, and there are no spare parts,' he said. The project also calls for spending Dollars 5m for environmental improvement, mainly on a clean-up of contaminated land and streams around the oilfields. Negotiations are under way with several international companies, including Mol of Hungary, and two US-based companies, Transmark and Anglo-Suisse, with contracts due to be signed this summer, Mr Isai said.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Bassam Abu-Sharif, adviser to PLO Chairman </F> Yasir 'Arafat; place not given; by unidentified studio  announcer, in Algiers -- live]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Announcer] We welcome Mr.  Bassam Abu-Sharif, adviser to Yasir 'Arafat . The first  question that comes to mind is perhaps how the Palestinian  Authority is going to deal with the parties that still oppose  the Gaza-Jericho agreement and endeavor to make it fail?    [Abu-Sharif] We consider opposition as a healthy  manifestation, and opposition has the right to express its  opinion as it likes, politically and through the media, but  violence is rejected in our political life. We will welcome  opinions no matter how different they may be, but we will  confront violence. We are convinced that all the opposition,  including the HAMAS [Islamic Resistance Movement] movement, will  be committed to our democratic traditions that prohibit the use  of violence as a means of resolving differences of views.    [Announcer] Some opposition sides consider that this  agreement is turning into a simple administration, or something  like a self-administration of the population.    [Abu-Sharif] The fact is that this is a first step. No one,  neither Chairman Yasir 'Arafat, nor the Palestinian leadership  have claimed that this is the solution. Not at all. This is  the first step on a long road towards our own independent state  with holy Jerusalem as capital.    [Announcer] As a first step you have agreed to the  withdrawal of the Israeli Army, but there remain the settlers  naturally, and we know that the al-Khalil [Hebron] massacre was  perpetrated by an Israeli settler.    [Abu-Sharif] It is natural that we should consider the  settlers as part of the occupation machine, and all land on  which an Israeli settler is residing is a Palestinian land  confiscated in contravention to the international laws, the UN  charter and the UN convention. For this reason, we will seek,  through negotiations, to secure an agenda for the evacuation of  the settlers from our Palestinian land, and no doubt the  settlers are the ones who know better about their situation now  following the withdrawal of the occupation forces. [passage  omitted].    [Announcer] Mr. Abu-Sharif, we know that there has always  been talk about the liberation of all Palestine. Now, can  Palestine be reduced to just Gaza and Jericho?    [Abu-Sharif] It can't be, naturally. As far as we are  concerned, our aim of setting up an independent Palestinian  state with Jerusalem as capital means setting up the state on  all the territories occupied by Israel in 1967. This is a  literal application of Resolution 242. Furthermore, I would  like to clarify beyond any doubt that the Palestinians will not  sign a peace treaty with the Israelis so long as is not  comprehensive, that is so long as it does not include Syria,  Jordan, and Lebanon after Israel's withdrawal from all the Arab  lands occupied in 1967, and south Lebanon which was occupied in  1978.    [Announcer] And what is the place of Jerusalem to a  Palestinian state?    [Abu-Sharif] Holy Jerusalem is a capital for an independent  Palestine, and we will accept nothing short of an Arab  Jerusalem, and there will be no peace without an Arab Jerusalem  over which an Arab flag will flutter.    [Announcer] Mr. Abu-Sharif, what do you expect from Algeria  in the struggle for the construction of Palestine now?    [Abu-Sharif] Algeria has always been a bastion protecting  Palestinians whether right or wrong, and we expect the Algerian  people that have always supported us in our military battles and  in the struggle to back the Palestinian people now to build its  own independent state.    [Announcer] Mr. Abu-Sharif, thank you for being present at  the 2000 bulletin.    [Abu-Sharif] Thanks to Algeria, and thank you.</p>

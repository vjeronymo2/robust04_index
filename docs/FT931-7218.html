			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Atreus to obtain official listing via reverse takeover ATREUS, a shower screen and mirror supplier, yesterday joined the growing trend of small companies using reverse takeovers to get an official listing, following proposals to close the Unlisted Securities Market. The group, which plans to merge with shell company URS International, is expected to have a market value of just Pounds 7.2m, following a placing and public offer of 27.5m shares at 20p each. The whole process is expected to cost the company Pounds 500,000 - roughly half its latest estimated annual profits. It is likely that this method of reversing into listed shells to come to the market will be increasingly pursued by smaller companies. 'The market is strong and institutions have an appetite for smaller company issues at the moment,' said one analyst. Mr Rodney Harnett, chairman, said Atreus aimed to grow through expanding its product ranges out of the bathroom, tackling new markets at home and abroad, such as hotels, and by acquisition. It had come to the market to help it finance that growth. However, Atreus will raise just Pounds 1m from the placing and offer, after issuing Pounds 4m in loan notes to the company's founders and executive directors, Mr Bruce Ledwith and Mr David Howarth, and paying expenses. Messers Ledwith and Howarth will retain between 20 and 25 per cent. It is likely that Atreus, which currently has cash balances of about Pounds 1m, will have to return to shareholders for cash after about 18 months. Mr Harnett said he aimed to show investors that the group was 'capable of sustaining growth and using our cash resources wisely' before making a further cash call. Atreus is forecasting a 36 per cent jump in pre-tax profits to Pounds 1.1m for the year to January 31 on sales of Pounds 6.2m (Pounds 4.7m). The group said a dividend of 0.75p would have been recommended had it been listed.</p>

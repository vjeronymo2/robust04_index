According to the information confirmed by authorities, the  Tarqui Artillery Battalion commander, a counterinsurgency  commander with the rank of major, a judge, her secretary, and a  noncommissioned officer died in the accident. Several people  were injured, three of whom were taken to San Jose Hospital in  Sogamoso. The authorities also reported that the three  helicopter pilots were Russian nationals. One pilot is injured.  The information Caracol obtained indicates that three of the  people taken to San Jose Hospital have been released. One of  them will continue to receive medical attention but is out of  danger. Here is German Garcia from Sogamoso with more details  on the incident.    [Garcia] Sogamoso medical officials reported that three  people were injured in the accident that took place at 1250  today. Three persons are at Sogamoso Hospital and the Social  Security's Julio Sandoval Medina Clinic. We have invited Dr.  Fernando Ortiz, who is the emergency ward chief, to tell us  about the victims' conditions.    [Ortiz] We treated two injured persons. One was a civilian.  The other patient was wearing civilian clothes, but I understand  that he is a serviceman.    [Garcia] Are other injured people being cared for in other  local clinics?    [Ortiz] I have learned that another injured person was taken  to the Social Security clinic.    [Garcia] What are their names?    [Ortiz] Excuse me, the Prosecutor's Office asked me not to  divulge that information. As you can understand, I cannot  provide those names.    [Garcia] Do you know if Tarqui Battalion Commander Ramiro  Guevara was among those wounded?    [Ortiz] I do not think so. The colonel was not one of the  two patients that were brought to this hospital. I do not know  if he was the injured person taken to the Social Security clinic.    [Garcia] Reports indicate at least nine persons were aboard  the helicopter. The three injured persons were able to jump  from the helicopter 200 meters before it crashed. Luckily,  nobody was in that area. Our sources told Caracol that Artillery  Tarqui Battalion Commander Ramiro Guevara, two sergeants, two  captains, one judge, her secretary, and one civilian who has not  been fully identified were aboard that helicopter. Dr. Fernando  Ortiz insisted that the Prosecutor's Office is not authorizing  him to reveal the names of the people who were injured in this  accident.</p>

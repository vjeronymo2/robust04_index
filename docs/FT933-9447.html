			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / People: ICI slims planning The incredible shrinking headquarters of Imperial Chemical Industries continues to slim with the retirement of Trevor Harrison, general manager of planning, and the decision to abolish his post. Other general managers' positions have also disappeared in recent months including those of Derek Rushton, in charge of external relations, and Brian Hines, responsible for insurance and investments. Harrison, a 54 year old chartered accountant, was with ICI 28 years and plans to use his retirement to travel, garden, play squash and improve his golf handicap which he says he has not taken seriously enough in the past. John Dewhurst, presently acquisitions manager will become group planning and acquisitions manager, heading up the now much smaller planning department. He will report to Colin Short, finance director, who assumes board responsibility for planning and acquisitions. In a separate move, Chris Hampson, one of the main board directors will take responsibility from next month for the regional businesses. Under him will be Ian Macfarlane, regional executive, who is also taking over as head of regional businesses in south east Asia. Based in London, he is also responsible for Argentina. As part of the restructuring of the Asian-Pacific organisation, Paul Schindler, chairman ICI China, is moving to Allied Signal, the US company, to become senior vice-president international. The colourful John Chandler, managing director ICI Taiwan and a fluent Mandarin speaker, takes on Schindler's role, while keeping his former position.</p>

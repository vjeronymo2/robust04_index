			<p><P> June 23, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> AREA ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> HUNTINGTON BEACH TRIATHLON SET FOR SATURDAY  </P> <P> About 600 competitors are expected to start the fourth Huntington Beach  triathlon, which will begin near the Huntington Beach Pier at 7 a.m. Saturday.  </P> <P> Emilio DeSoto of San Diego, who finished second in the Orange County Performing  Arts Center triathlon June 4 at Mission Viejo, is scheduled to compete in the  $6,500 Huntington Beach race. Among those expected to challenge DeSoto are Doug  Roberts, also of San Diego, who finished fifth in the Memphis triathlon; Rob  Bistodeau of Del Mar; Mike Fillipow of Huntington Beach, and Australian Mark  Pringle, who will be competing in the United States for the first time.  </P> <P> Brad Kearns of Malibu, who won the event last year, will be unable to compete  because of an injury.  </P> <P> "We have had a tremendous amount of calls from those wanting to compete in the  event," race director Jack Caress said. "We're already 100 ahead of last year's  pace."  </P> <P> Nancy Vallance, a Santa Barbara resident who won the Human Race triathlon last  October at Newport Beach, is among the favorites in the women's competition,  along with Karen Chequer-Pfeiffer of Alta Loma and Shannon Delaney of San  Diego. Kim Kucera of Huntington Beach also will compete.  </P> <P> The event, which starts with a one-kilometer (approximately five-eighths of a  mile) swim around the pier, also includes a 30-kilometer bike race (about 18  miles) along the bluffs of Bolsa Chica State Park and an eight-kilometer run  (nearly five miles) along the Huntington Beach boardwalk. The run -- and  triathlon -- will end in a parking lot adjacent to the pier.  </P> <P> The winners in the men's and women's competitions will receive $1,500 each. The  second-place finishers will each receive $750 and third place is worth $500.  </P> <P> Today is the final day of sign-ups, which will take place at the Huntington  Beach Inn from 5 to 9 p.m. The entry fee is $45.

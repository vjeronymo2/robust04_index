			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / Leading Article: Questions for the car makers THE motor industry has pre-dictably huffed and puffed over a recent study for the Monopolies and Mergers Commission which finds that some cars sell in Britain for 50 per cent more than elsewhere in the European Community. However, the MMC should not allow the car makers to side-track its investigation by seeking simply to discredit the study or by arguing that the car market is so complex as to frustrate attempts at exact price comparisons. Almost every recent independent survey has found wide discrepancies between car prices in the UK and on the Continent. Such an accumulation of evidence cannot just be dismissed as flawed or irrelevant. The onus is now on the industry to demonstrate conclusively that substantial price differences do not exist, or that they are due entirely to normal business costs. That obligation is all the greater because UK and EC policies have long afforded the industry special privileges. The MMC - and British consumers - need to be satisfied that these are not being abused to distort competition. The most obvious privilege is the block exemption of car distribution from EC competition rules, which authorises manufacturers to sell exclusively through designated dealers. Though the UK would need to seek European Commission approval for any changes, the MMC findings are likely to carry weight in Brussels, which is conducting its own review of the scheme. Doubly dubious The exemption was granted in response to industry arguments that cars require expert maintenance which can only be assured if dealers enjoy adequate profit margins and are answerable to manufacturers. But such assertions are doubly dubious, given the reliability of modern cars and the poor quality of much car servicing in the UK. Surveys by the Consumers' Association have found standards to be no higher at franchised dealers than at independent garages. Nor have car makers themselves hesitated to bypass dealers when it suited them. A recent study by the Retail Motor Industry Federation found that about a fifth of all UK car sales were made directly to fleet buyers. Discounts ranged up to 40 per cent - far higher than those offered to individuals. The federation concludes that business users are being subsidised by private buyers, who are denied the advantages of bulk purchasing by the block exemption. The distortion has been aggravated by tax concessions on company cars, which have concentrated buying power in the hands of fleet operators. There is also evidence that the scheme has restricted consumer choice. Mr Paul Tosch, chairman of Vauxhall, acknowledged as much when he said last week that if company car users had to pay for their vehicles themselves, they would buy far more models from abroad. In effect, the scheme is a non-tariff barrier. In the interests of a competitive market, the sooner the government removes any residual subsidy to company cars, the better. Third privilege The third privilege enjoyed by the car industry is the 'gentleman's agreement' limiting Japanese imports into the UK. The MMC has already identified the restriction as a 'complex monopoly' but has yet to decide whether it is harming consumers. However, a study for the National Consumer Council has estimated that it adds as much as Pounds 2,000 to the price of imported Japanese cars. In any event, the 16-year-old restriction has long since outlived its original purpose of sheltering the UK-owned car industry. It is curious, to say the least, that a government which has so vigorously attacked trade barriers in other fields should have continued to smile on this protectionist relic. It is odder still that Whitehall is ready to have the arrangement enshrined in the EC's planned restraints on Japanese cars. The government showed courage in exposing the car industry to MMC scrutiny. It needs to be prepared for the possibility that a really searching investigation will uncover restrictive practices and market distortions which will require as much firmness of purpose to eradicate.</p>

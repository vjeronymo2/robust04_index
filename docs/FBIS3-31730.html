			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Negotiations between representatives of the  Ministry of Industry and the delegation of the Lignitul [Brown  Coal] Mining Trade Union Federation of Targu Jiu resumed at the  ministry's headquarters this morning, with the only issue still  pending being the consent of the Industry Ministry to suspend  the management board of the Targu Jiu Brown Coal Public  Corporation for the duration of investigations that are going to  be conducted by a ministerial inquiry commission.    At approximately 1215 the negotiations broke off with the  intent to resume an hour later. Meanwhile, the trade union  delegation went to the Bucharest headquarters of Romania's  Mining Trade Union Confederation. At 1400 correspondents  waiting for the resumption of talks at the Ministry of Industry  were asked to go to the headquarters of Romania's Mining Trade  Union Confederation, where Mr. Dumitru Leonte, vice president of  the confederation, said that since the delegation did not have  the mandate to sign the protocol in the drafted form, it  renounced to negotiate any further and left for Targu Jiu to  present the document and discuss it with the other trade union  leaders.    A commission of the Ministry of Industry is expected to  arrive in Targu Jiu next Monday, 21 February, to investigate --  in the light of repeated demands made in this respect by the  miners -- the activity of the management board of the Brown Coal  Public Corporation. Mr. Dumitru Leonte emphasized that the  commission should include experts of the control bodies of the  Ministry of Industry, the Prime Minister's Office, the Ministry  of Labor and Social Security, and the Ministry of Finance. He  ruled out the presence in the inquiry commission of any member  of the management board of the Targu Jiu Brown Coal Public  Corporation, our correspondent Catalin Trandafir reports.    At the request of the correspondents, a news conference was  held at the headquarters of the Targu Jiu Brown Coal Public  Corporation, with the participation of Messrs. Gheorghe  Marculescu, prefect of Gorj County; Radu Mironovici, general  manager of the aforementioned public corporation; Colonel  Constantin Codica, chief of the Police Inspectorate of Gorj  County; and Gorj Deputy Nicolae Mischie.    After a presentation of last week's events, following the  strike launched by the Lignitul Mining Trade Union Federation of  Targu Jiu, the speakers pointed to the illegal nature of that  labor action and emphasized that in the coming days, a  governmental commission will begin its inquiry into accusations  brought against the management board of the public corporation,  while representatives of the Court of Public Accounts will  conduct their own inquiry. We are open to any kind of checks,  General Manager Radu Mironovici said. Answering the  correspondents' questions, he gave details about the  relationship between the trade unions and the public  corporation. On the other hand, the management board of the  Targu Jiu Brown Coal Public Corporation will conduct its own  inquiry into damages caused by the strikers over the past five  days of labor action and will take steps to recover these  damages and punish the guilty ones.    The head of the Police Inspectorate of Gorj County again  emphasized the illegal nature of the strike and said that the  leaders of the Lignitul Mining Trade Union Federation of Targu  Jiu have been penally punished in the past for violating the  law. He said that legal steps had been initiated against Miron  Cosma, who will be sued for serious abuse [ultraj] after the  indictment is finalized by the Targu Jiu Prosecuting Magistracy  and forwarded to the appropriate court, our correspondent Titus  Stoichitoiu reports.</p>

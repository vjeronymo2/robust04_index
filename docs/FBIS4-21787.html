			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Amman AL-BILAD in Arabic on 30 March  publishes on page 5 an approximately 4,000-word report on the  suspects charged in connection with a spate of recent explosions  in Jordan.    AL-BILAD, ``an independent political weekly,'' claims to  have  accompanied Major Muhannad Hijazi, the public prosecutor of the  State Security Court, and the defendants to the sites targeted  for explosions. The defendants were reported to have been in  good health. They were also reported to have said that they are  ``heroes'' because they carried out these bombings. The  argument that they advanced is that they were carrying out God's  injunction against ``debauchery.'' They reportedly planned to  establish a caliphate, assassinate intelligence and army  personnel, and kill the Jordanian and Palestinian peace talks  teams to halt the march of ``capitulation,'' as they put it.    The weekly states that 'Abdallah Kamil al-Shuraydah  al-Hashayikah is the principal defendant in the series of  bombings that have recently taken place in Jordan. The weekly  notes that al-Hashayikah, a member of the Muslim Brotherhood,  Suwaylih Branch, left Amman in 1990 to work as a teacher of  Arabic in the Philippines, where he also taught at the al-Imam  al-Shafi'i Foundation. This foundation is supervised by Jamal  Khalifah, also known as Abi-Bara', a Saudi national and an  in-law of Usamah Bin-Ladin, a Saudi national of Yemeni origin  currently living in Khartoum, Sudan. Khalifah, Bin-Ladin's  right hand-man, is reported to be close to the ruling Saudi  family.    According to the paper, al-Hashayikah discussed with  Khalifah  the idea of launching of an organization in Jordan to  ``eradicate forbidden conduct by force'' in order to lay the  groundwork for establishing a caliphate in Jordan. This idea  was well received by Jamal Khalifah. The recruits of the  organization would be Jordanians who received military training  in Afghanistan during the war with the Soviets. The only thing  the organization needed was financing. The report states that  this all happened while the two were in the Philippines.  Al-Hashayikah returned to Amman early this year to launch his  organization so that he might receive the promised finances from  Bin-Ladin, and Jamal Khalifah, ``the mastermind of Bin-Ladin's  terrorist operations in the Arab world.''    The article continues, noting that the organization  al-Hashayikah used had already taken its final shape before he  left for the Philippines. It had a joint command consisting of  himself, as well as Jihad al-Tanjir, Zakariyah Muhammad Dawud,  and Isma'il al-'Amayirah. They used mosques and places of  worship to ``concoct conspiracies.'' The recruits of the  organization received refresher courses in military training  during further visits to Afghanistan via Saudi Arabia or Yemen.    According to the paper, ``Bin-Ladin's group'' received the  recruits in Saudi Arabia upon their arrival there, and provided  them with the necessary visas and air tickets to Pakistan, where  they then traveled to Afghanistan. Shaykh 'Abd-al-Majid  al-Zandani, representative of the Yemeni Reform Grouping at the  Yemeni Presidential Council, is reported to have provided the  Afghan Arabs stopping over in Yemen en route to Afghanistan with  the necessary visas and air tickets, as well as ``his constant  financial support for the organization.''    The weekly also claims that some of the organization members  remained in Jordan to plan bomb attacks and recruit other  members. Having faced difficulties in acquiring the necessary  explosives in Jordan, the organization sent Zakariyah Muhammad  Dawud Qasim to Yemen, where he was trained in how to manufacture  sophisticated explosives. He was also trained in detonating  explosives by remote control.    The paper explains that, in order to achieve its objectives,  the organization believed that it had to kill Arab and Muslim  leaders who do not apply the Islamic sharia in their countries.  It also believed that it had to resist the ongoing Middle East  peace negotiations by all means, including the use of force.  The organization also planned to blow up movie theaters,  nightclubs, bars, tourist areas, liquor stores, and public areas  where the two sexes mingle, such as the Housing Bank Complex.  The organization also planned to assassinate senior  intelligence, army, and public security personnel in order to  pave the way for the creation of a caliphate in Jordan.    Noting a plan by the organization to assassinate the  Jordanian and Palestinian peace talks negotiators, AL-BILAD  says: ``In addition to carrying out bombings, the organization  members entertained the idea of drawing up a full-fledged plan  to liquidate Jordanian and Palestinian peace negotiators, headed  by Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali, former head of  the Jordanian delegation to the peace talks.''    According to the paper, the group found al-Majali's home  telephone number, and telephoned him, telling him they were  journalists working for a local daily. They asked for a date  for an important press interview with him. Al-Majali agreed to  grant them an interview. Al-Majali was meant to be assassinated  during this bogus interview, according to the report, which it  said was planned with a great deal of cleverness. A date was  set for the interview and forty-eight hours before the interview  was scheduled to take place, the organization leadership had  drawn up a detailed plan to assassinate al-Majali by explosive  charges and other weapons to be carried by the bogus press team,  which would have consisted of reporters and cameramen.    The paper says it was only divine providence that intervened  to save al-Majali, who was assigned an official mission outside  Jordan. This mission required him to travel to Washington ahead  of the time set for the implementation of the assassination  plan. Thus, the bogus interview date was postponed to a later  date. However, this date has never materialized because the  culprits were apprehended.    The weekly paper goes on to say that, having failed in their  bid to liquidate al-Majali, the organization members attempted  to assassinate members of the Palestinian delegation to the  Middle East peace talks, including Faysal al-Husayni and Hanan  'Ashrawi. However, stringent security precautions and the  secrecy with which al-Husayni and 'Ashrawi surround their moves  thwarted the defendants' scheme. Undeterred by their failure,  the defendants recruited an employee of the Grand Palace Hotel,  where the Palestinian peace negotiators stayed. The hotel  employee was asked to plant explosive charges in the peace  negotiators' rooms. Once again, strict security precautions  thwarted their scheme.    According to the report, the failure of the organization's  assassination scheme prompted the organization command to  endorse a plan of explosions in Jordan to convince Jamal  Khalifah to finance the organization. This resulted in  explosions at movie theaters in Amman and al-Zarqa'. However,  attempts to carry out further explosions elsewhere in Jordan  failed.    Muhammad 'Ali Shihadah is reportedly the ``organization's  mastermind responsible for picking explosion targets.''    The paper's investigations indicated that 'Abdallah Diyyah,  a  prominent Suwaylih-based Muslim Brotherhood member, was  acquainted with the organization's scheme by 'Abdallah  al-Hashayikah. However, Muslim Brotherhood sources ruled out  Diyyah's involvement in this scheme.    Elaborating further on this issue, the paper says: ``Several  quarters insinuated that the Muslim Brotherhood could be  implicated in these explosion incidents, particularly since  al-Hashayikah was a Brotherhood leader in Suwaylih, not to  mention the fact that Diyyah was close to the hawkish wing of  the Muslim Brotherhood. Meanwhile, informed sources ruled out  this possibility, which has not been confirmed by the  interrogations conducted with the defendants.''    ``AL-BILAD has learned that 23 persons have been implicated  in the recent spate of explosions. They will stand trial at the  State Security Court within the next two weeks. If found  guilty, they could receive punitive measures, including the  death sentence. These defendants are the following: 'Abd Salih  Husayn al-Jahalin, Muhammad 'Ali Husayn Shihadah Abu-'Ayyad,  Yasin Hasan Muhammad Zahrah, Hasan Hamdan Hasan 'Abd-al-Qadir,  Muhammad Salih Musa 'Aqil, Sulayman Ahmad 'Abd-al-'Al Bisah,  Muhammad Ahmad 'Abd-al-Fattah al-'Adharibah, Samir Ahmad  Muhammad Tilagh, 'Abd-al-Nasir Mahmud Muhammad Yunus, Fa'iq  Salih Yusuf al-Shawish, 'Umar Jibril Muhammad al-Shawahin,  'Abdallah Kamil al-Hashayikah, Jihad Ahmad Khalid al-Tanjir,  Khalil Tawfiq Muhammad 'Alqam, Muhammad Ahmad al-Shaykh  al-Fahmawi, Salim Musa Yusuf, Zakariyah Muhammad Dawud Qasim,  Isma'il Sa'id al-'Amayirah, Muhammad Sa'id Muqbil Dar-'Awdah,  Walid Muhammad 'Ashsha, Muhammad Amin al-Shamasinah, Ra'd  Khalil, and 'Abd-al-Majid al-'Adharibah.''    AL-BILAD concludes its report by promising to provide its  readers with further details as they unfold when the State  Security Court begins to investigate this case.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Wuhan, April 3 (XINHUA) -- Housing cooperatives  have proved to be an effective way to help more residents in  Wuhan, capital of Hubei Province, move into new homes.    According to local officials, 13,000 urban households have  so  far moved into new homes through joining housing cooperatives.    The funds to build housing cooperative homes come mainly  from  future dwellers themselves, coupled with a small subsidy from  their employer and certain preferential treatment from the city  government.    Wuhan is believed to be one of the first cities to pilot the  housing cooperative system in China. Over the past several  years, more and more factories and institutions got together and  set up housing cooperatives, to help solve the housing problem  for their own workers.    Some 61 housing cooperatives have now been established in  the  city, constructing flats with floor space totalling 945,000 sq m.</p>

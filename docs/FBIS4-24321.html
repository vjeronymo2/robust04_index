			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The leadership of the NPFL [National Patriotic  Front of Liberia] says while it welcomes the idea of the arms  seizure exercise in Monrovia, it is questioning the motives  behind the scheme. Recently, ECOMOG [Economic Community of West  African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] was reported to have  raided the residence of ULIMO's [United Liberation Movement for  Democracy in Liberia] leader, Alhaji Koromah, in Paynesville,  Monrovia, claiming to have discovered large quantities of arms  and ammunition and arresting several loyal supporters and  soldiers of Alhaji Koromah. Similar exercise was also carried  out by ECOMOG on the residence of breakaway ULIMO leader  Roosevelt Johnson.    The leadership of the NPFL is wondering whether ECOMOG,  which  facilitated ULIMO in Monrovia all along as an armed group, did  not know whether Alhaji Koromah had arms and ammunition in  Monrovia. The leadership of the NPFL strongly warns that the  action of ECOMOG is a bad precedent, which jeopardizes the  security of leaders of warring factions under the Cotonou Peace  Accord. The leadership of the NPFL stressed that the illegal  arms raid on the living headquarters of both Koromah and Johnson  by ECOMOG with AFL [Armed Forces of Liberia] assistance is  totally unacceptable. The NPFL leader, President Taylor,  stressed that Liberia is not under martial law and the  (?seizure) exercise in Monrovia by ECOMOG with AFL assistance is  unacceptable.    [Begin Taylor recording] This exercise is unacceptable and  must be stopped now. We wish to state, in no uncertain terms,  that this nation is not under a military regime. We have no  state of emergency (?imposed here). Therefore, we will not  tolerate any such illegal seizure. Do you remember, fellow  Liberians, the same old Samuel Doe soldiers who visited [words  indistinct] and butchered innocent citizens, leaving behind  mutilated bodies? Yes, they claimed then to be carrying out  searches at that time. But the results were devastating, as  thousands were murdered in cold blood. The memories of these  actions are fresh in our minds. Do you want them back in your  homes? Today they are coming again. Who knows what their real  intents are? [end recording]    Former President Taylor cited the legal implications  involved  in the search and seizure exercise, noting that the action  constitutes a violation of the constitutional rights of  Liberians.

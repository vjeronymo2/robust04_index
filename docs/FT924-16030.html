			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / International Company News: Alcatel gains 20% to FFr3.1bn ALCATEL Alsthom, the French telecommunications and engineering group, yesterday reported a 20 per cent rise in first-half net profits, mainly due to exceptional gains, and forecast higher earnings for the year as a whole. Net income climbed to FFr3.1bn (Dollars 615m) in the first six months of this year, from FFr2.6bn in the same period of 1991, on sales up by 6 per cent to FFr79.47bn. Most of the rise in net income is due to a FFr437m capital gain on the sale of Treasury stock. Operating profits, by contrast, fell by 3 per cent to FFr6.34bn. This was 'satisfactory in view of the current economic climate', said the group. It blamed the slight drop in operating income on depressed conditions in the market for private telephone equipment and the fact that some recent acquisitions, such as Rockwell International's transmission systems business and Canada Wire, a cable supplier, were less profitable than the group norm. A temporary reduction in Spain's telephone equipment investment programme hit operating profits, said the group. On average, Alcatel Alsthom's subsidiaries produced a 5 per cent net return on turnover, the company said. Fully diluted earnings per share rose by 8 per cent over the period to FFr24.70.</p>

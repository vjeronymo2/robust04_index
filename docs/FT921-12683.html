			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow turns sharply lower as long-term rates rise Wall Street AFTER a hesitant opening, US share prices turned decisively lower yesterday in the wake of higher long-term interest rates and some poor fourth-quarter earnings, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 29.07 at 3,226.74. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's also ended lower, down 3.18 at 414.96. In contrast, away from the Big Board, the Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter stocks, which has endured heavy selling recently, continued to attract buyers and finished 2.18 higher at 622.86. NYSE turnover was 230m shares. Among individual stocks the release of quarterly earnings continued to dominate sentiment. Delta Airlines fell Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 73 1/8 on news of its operating loss of Dollars 237m in the last three months of 1991, while USAir gave up early gains and ended Dollars  1/2 easier at Dollars 15 7/8 in the wake of modest but unexpected profit for the fourth quarter. Elsewhere in the sector, AMR, parent of American Airlines, fell Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 72 5/8 and UAL eased Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 148 1/2 . Airline stocks were also affected by the news that Salomon Brothers had issued a sell recommendation on the entire sector on Monday. AT&amp;T fell Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 39 5/8 after the telecommunications group announced fourth-quarter profits of Dollars 635m, down from the previous year but reduced by a Dollars 218m charge to cover the write-down of the company's investment in an Italian group. Morrison-Knudsen climbed Dollars 1 3/8 early on but fell away in late trading to end up just Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 53 1/8 . A local authority in Los Angeles voted to cancel a Dollars 121m subway car contract with Sumitomo group of Japan in order to give US firms a better chance. Morrison is tipped as one of the favourites to win the contract. Centel soared Dollars 9 1/8 to Dollars 46 1/8 on the news that it had hired some investment banks to pursue the possible sale of the company. Unisys put in one of the best performances of the day amid heavy trading. The stock jumped Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 7 in volume of 9.6m shares after the computer manufacturer announced a big improvement in 1991 fourth-quarter earnings, which recovered from a loss at the same stage of 1990 to post a 31 cents a share profit. Investors were also buoyed by reports from the company that US orders were up sharply in the quarter. Monsanto fell Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 66 1/8 after the chemicals group announced it would give its 12,000 employees a Dollars 1,000 contribution each toward the cost of buying or leasing a new US-made car. Canada TORONTO stock prices closed lower in heavy trading, as gold stocks turned sharply downward. According to preliminary figures, the composite index fell 14.26 points, or 0.39 per cent, to close at 3,624.53. Declining issues outnumbered advances 334 to 301. American Barrick fell 1 3/8 to 32 3/8 to lead gold's decline after spot gold in New York fell USDollars 3 to USDollars 354.75 an ounce. Shell Canada jumped 1 1/4 to 40 1/4 .

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Professor Wieslaw Piatkowski, chairman of the </F> Polish Peasant Party Supreme Executive Committee: "Market  Economy--Yes, but With a Difference"]    [Text] There are two main questions at issue in the Polish  Peasant Party [PSL] report and program-formulating campaign.  The first is to sum up the work of our organizations during the  period under review and to obtain their opinions concerning our  program tasks. The second question entails the following  objectives: to assess the extent to which our program was  realized during the period under review (on both the global and  local scale); to formulate recommendations concerning the  realization of our program (also on the global and local scale),  which could be linked to proposing suggestions for a review of  individual points in the program. It is the second question  that I propose to discuss here.    I believe that the best method to use will be the comparison  method: We should compare our program with the tenets of the  coalition agreement and then compare both these documents with  the declarations of the coalition government and its actual  policy. Of necessity, this should be done concisely, so the  present publication does not pretend to be an exhaustive  presentation of its subject.  <H5>  Economic Revival and Struggle Against Unemployment </H5>   Both the PSL program and the coalition agreement accept the  general tenets of the market economy and stipulate the following  goals: revival and consolidation of economic growth; increased  competitiveness of the Polish economy; priority status for a  campaign against unemployment; and, to quote, "a different  approach (from our earlier policy) to the social welfare policy  and a just distribution of the necessary hardships to be borne  by different social and income groups in the course of the  process of reforming the economy." The following principle has  been formulated: "The social welfare policy will be treated not  as an onerous appendage to the economy but as a precondition for  its development." These tenets can be described as the overall  objectives of the economic transformation.    The above aims are accompanied by stipulations whose  realization will be of instrumental significance in achieving  the overall objectives. The stipulations, which are also  included in our program, are: to repair the condition of the  public finance sector; to develop an industry policy; to  selectively protect the domestic market; to stimulate investment  and export initiatives (with the help of investment allowances  and credits); to reduce enterprises' debts; to accord equal  treatment to the private and public sectors of the economy; to  enforce financial obligations toward the state (by refusing to  tolerate the so-called gray zone); and to work out a "strategy  for economic growth and development."    These shared ideas of our own program and the coalition  agreement have found reflection in the economic policy pursued  by the coalition government. This is shown by the 1994 state  budget. After all, its characteristic features are: orientation  in favor of the development of production, investment projects,  and exports, with the associated investment concessions; tax  concessions linked to the creation of new jobs in regions  threatened with particularly high unemployment; the more than  threefold increase of the upper limit of State Treasury credit  guarantees; the threefold increase of funds allocated for the  promotion of exports; increased funds for industrial  restructuring (concentrated mainly in the coal- and  sulfur-extraction sectors); increased funds allocated for  additional financing of interest liabilities on preferential  credits to agriculture; the halting of the decrease in  expenditure earmarked for the budget-funded sector; an increase  of the lowest disability and old-age pensions; increased  expenditure on social welfare assistance schemes; development of  new forms of active antiunemployment measures, including  emergency and public works.  <H5>  The Guiding Principle </H5>   All of this should be made common knowledge among delegates  to report congresses. Therefore, the above questions should be  presented by competent specialists who are thoroughly conversant  with the PSL program and ideological principles, the contents of  all coalition agreements, the Sejm acts, and government policy.  They should be able to demonstrate that government policy is  subordinate to the specific leading concepts ensuing from our  program and from the coalition agreements. However, this by no  means implies that we should suspend our possible criticism of  that policy.    On the other hand, it is necessary to contest the view that  the PSL allegedly promised a very rapid improvement in the  population's material circumstances if it won an election  victory and participation in the government. The PSL maintained  consistently that all that could possibly be achieved on a  short-term basis would be a rationalization of the economy that  would not create a sufficient foundation for any significant  improvement of the working people's situation, and that such  chances would have to wait until a long-term economic program  was first worked out and then put into practice. The same  position is held by the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] and the  coalition.  <H5>  Our Attitude Toward the SLD and the Coalition </H5>   Discussion of these topics entails the question of our  fundamental position regarding the SLD, including the Social  Democracy of the Polish Republic [SdRP]. This should be defined  by two factors: the PSL's attitude toward the doctrine of  social democracy, which is expressed in our Ideological  Declaration, and the requirement that we cooperate with the  social democrats in the interest of keeping a center-left  government.    Let me recall that our Ideological Declaration states  clearly  the following: "The ideology of the Polish Peasant Party  endorses selected aspects of the doctrines of social democracy  and democratic socialism. This is because the policy of  agrarianism is characterized by a similar sensitivity to  questions of social justice and exploitation, political and  economic democracy, public self-government structures, the forms  and functions of ownership, and the socialization of the  economic management processes." It follows from this that our  potential criticism of the SLD cannot be construed as arising  from the fact that the latter adopts a social democratic--or, in  this context, leftist--orientation. It follows further that our  possible criticism of that formation would be more justified if  it were seen to betray the ideals of social democracy than if it  actually cultivated these ideals. There are, in fact, some  grounds for asking whether the SdRP is, on certain occasions,  true to the social democratic doctrine.    It is worth recalling that, in the light of its Ideological  Declaration, the PSL is a center-left group. It follows from  this that any potential right-oriented sympathies on our  members' part would be incompatible with the PSL's ideological  principles.    The requirement of cooperation with the social democrats in  the interest of maintaining a center-left oriented government is  quite obvious. In such a coalition, the PSL is able to preserve  its ideological identity. A coalition with right-oriented  groups would result in a significant curtailment of the  realization of our program and could even lead to a denial of  the PSL's ideological identity.    Where there are any differences of opinion between the PSL  and the SdRP, it is necessary to apply every effort of will to  overcome these differences. I believe that this is always  possible on the basis of a rational (as opposed to emotional)  set of arguments. The rationality of the arguments should rest  on the ideological principles of both groups.    As regards progress in implementing our program, it is also  worth noting certain associated restrictions formulated in the  coalition agreement.    The agreement contains the following statement: "As for our  predecessors, we differ from them not so much in our formulation  of the general economic objectives as in the methods, tactics,  and means we recommend for their realization."    It could, of course, be said that the coalition intends to  create a market economy just as the former Solidarity-derived  governments did. However, the particular models of that economy  vary in each case, and this should reflect the fundamental  difference between the aims adopted by the Solidarity  governments (which were right-oriented) and the center-left  governments.    This very difference in the respective governments' aims  should find its expression on the plane of forging economic  relations--that is, so-called ownership relations--and  distribution relations specific for the coalition. On the first  point, there is no full consensus between the PSL and the SLD,  so we should strive to work out an agreement in this matter as  soon as possible. Here we must be guided by the idea of mixed  ownership, which stands in direct contrast to the absolute value  placed on the capitalist concept of ownership.    The question of relations of distribution requires a deeper  treatment. The coalition agreement states: "The state must  seek to alleviate the sharp contrasts between the incomes of  various social groups inherent in the essence of the market  economy, and, in particular, it must counteract the spread of  areas of destitution in our society." Our objective here is not  solely to alleviate the differences in peoples' incomes. A  center-left government should by definition be guided by the  principle of significantly reducing the imbalance in the  distribution of national income; it should also seek to exert  influence on the very model of the relations of distribution in  the spirit of social justice.  <H5>  Learning and Labor Before Capital </H5>   In his 29 December 1993 Sejm address, the prime minister  said, among other things: "It is necessary to restore balance  in Poland so that learning and labor take precedence over  capital.... It is our duty in a civilized country to ensure  prosperity for society as a whole, and not just for select  elements of society, even if the latter demonstrate the utmost  economic activity." I believe that this is precisely the spirit  that should influence the shaping of government policy.    I should like to recommend that we base the long-term  strategic government program on the fundamental principles of  agrarianism (and, by the same token, on John Paul II's social  teaching, on which we draw in our Ideological Declaration).    This question should also be accorded particular attention  at  the PSL's future report congresses.</p>

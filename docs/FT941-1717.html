			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Satellite row causes Brussels legal action The UK appears to be heading for another row with Brussels following a decision yesterday by the European Commission to start legal action against the British government for failure to comply with a television directive. The row is about whether the UK is too lax in licensing satellite television channels which can be shown all over the European Union. The commission is taking the UK to the European Court of Justice over the technical issue of jurisdiction. All other EU countries regulate satellite channels in the country where their headquarters are located. The UK, following the European Council convention on the issue, believes jurisdiction should be in the country where the programme signal is 'up-linked' to the satellite. The jurisdiction issue masks the real dispute which is about quotas to preserve European programme content. Under the directive, cable and satellite television channels have to carry a majority of European-made programmes 'where practicable'. Channels which do not are expected to move progressively in that direction. Channels such as Mr Ted Turner's TNT/Cartoon channel, licensed in the UK, feature mostly American material. The commission is believed to have decided to move against the UK on the jurisdiction issue because it might not be successful on quotas regarding the 'where practicable' qualification. A new green paper on audio-visual industries throughout the EU is believed to suggest strengthening the quota system, possibly requiring evidence of direct investment in European programming. Yesterday's decision means the commission has decided to try to force the UK to come into line with the rest of Europe. The move is likely to be welcomed by France and Belgium, which have complained that the UK's failure to impose EU standards on satellite television has left TNT/Cartoon free to broadcast into their markets. The present situation, the commission argues, makes a mockery of the single market, since broadcasters can fall under two national licensing systems - or under none, as in the recent case of the pornographic channel Red Hot Dutch, which evaded both UK and Dutch licensing laws. In December the National Heritage Department in the UK wrote to a number of satellite channels asking what progress they had made in meeting the 51 per cent programme quota.</p>

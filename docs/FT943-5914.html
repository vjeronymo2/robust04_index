			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Artisan closure behind Spring Ram deficit Spring Ram, the Yorkshire-based kitchen, bathrooms and furniture group, is to close its lossmaking Artisan Tile factory in Bradford. The new management, appointed after institutional investors forced a boardroom shake-out last year, said intense price competition from imports was likely to prolong the losses at Artisan, which started production in 1992 and lost Pounds 1m in the last six months. It employs 95 people, but the group hopes to redeploy about 30 of the workforce. An exceptional charge of Pounds 2.5m for the closure pushed Spring Ram to a pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.1m for the six months to July 2. This compared with losses of Pounds 34.4m last time, which included Pounds 30.3m of write-offs and charges. The group incurred an operating profit of Pounds 2.2m, compared with losses of Pounds 4.8m. Sales rose by 11 per cent to Pounds 18m. Mr Roger Regan, chairman, said: 'The deflationary pricing conditions both in our home and international markets and in the UK economy as a whole, coupled with the first signs of increased raw material prices, make internal improvements in efficiency and productivity all important.' Spring Ram's kitchen division, its biggest and most profitable business, increased sales by 8.5 per cent to Pounds 62.6m, and operating profits rose from Pounds 4.7m to Pounds 6m. After a good first quarter for the division as a whole, the rate of sales growth in the UK home improvement market was checked in the second half of May and June. Sales in the bathroom division fell to Pounds 28.3m (Pounds 29.7m), but the elimination of lossmaking activities enabled the division to report operating profits of Pounds 100,000, compared with a loss of Pounds 3.2m last time. The special products division, which includes Artisan, increased sales from Pounds 14.9m to Pounds 21.5m and cut operating losses from Pounds 7.1m to Pounds 4.7m. Turnover rose at Regency Doors, while operating losses fell. Stag, the group's furniture business, increased sales by 21 per cent to Pounds 15.8m. Operating profits remained static at Pounds 800,000 as the group invested in new products for its living and dining room ranges. Losses per share were 0.3p, compared with losses of 10.4p last time. COMMENT The new team at Spring Ram continues to make progress, but the sluggish trading environment and costlier raw materials mean they face a hard slog. Closure of Artisan will disappoint, but the losses could scarcely be maintained - the whole venture will have cost the group Pounds 9.5m since start-up, including the latest Pounds 2.5m exceptional charge. Analysts expect operating profits of about Pounds 6m this year, but all eyes are on 1995 and 1996 when profits could bounce back to Pounds 18m and more than Pounds 30m respectively. The shares, down 1 1/2 p to 51p, are on a sky-high multiple of 36 this year, but that falls to 16 for 1995 and below 10 for 1996. They remain an attractive recovery play.</p>

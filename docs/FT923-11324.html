			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Sidney Banks 4% ahead TURNOVER at Sidney C Banks, the agricultural merchants and cereal processors, advanced 23 per cent in the year ended April 30 1992, but the growth in pre-tax profit was limited to 4 per cent. Sales came to Pounds 239.8m (Pounds 195.2m) and the profit to Pounds 2.29m (Pounds 2.21m). Earnings per share were trimmed to 19.9p (20.2p) while a maintained final dividend of 5.5p increases the total to 8.25p (8p). The directors said that another harvest of excellent quality meant the company was again unable to make full use of its skills in grain marketing. The volume of sales of farm supplies had been maintained. Non-agricultural activities continued to make satisfactory contributions. Recent investments in Banks Odam Dennick and Doltons helped to increase profits.</p>

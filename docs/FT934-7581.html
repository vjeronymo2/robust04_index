			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / The Queen's Speech: Registration to be simplified - Trademarks THE GOVERNMENT yesterday gave a much-needed boost to London's chances of being chosen as the home of the European Trademarks Office by announcing a long-awaited overhaul of UK trademark law. The bill will simplify the system for registering and protecting trademarks and will implement the 1989 EC Trademarks Directive. It will become easier for a trademark to qualify for registration, allowing companies will be able to register distinctive three-dimensional shapes, such as bottles, and placenames which form part of a brand or company name. The bill will improve protection for trademarks by making it unlawful to use one to sell goods and services similar to those covered by the registered trademark. It will also simplify procedures for registering them, abolishing the distinction between between trademarks and service marks.</p>

			<p><P> May 31, 1990, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> BICOASTAL TO SELL OFF LINK-MILES SUBSIDIARY  </P> <P> Bicoastal Corp., reorganizing under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code,  said it will sell subsidiary Link-Miles Ltd. to Thomson-CSF for $100 million.  </P> <P> Link-Miles Ltd., with headquarters in Lancing, England, develops military and  commercial flight simulators.  </P> <P> Thomson-CSF is a unit of the Paris-based conglomerate Thomson SA.  </P> <P> The deal must still be approved by U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Tampa and by the  British and French governments, said Janet H. Rogan, a spokeswoman for  Bicoastal.  </P> <P> Also pending is the sale of Simuflite, a pilot training facility in Dallas,  said Rogan.  </P> <P> The transaction will not affect Link-Miles Corp. of Binghampton, N.Y., which  also manufactures flight simulators.  </P> <P> Bicoastal, formerly Singer Co., filed for protection from creditors in  November, 1989. Paul A. Bilzerian acquired Singer in February, 1988, for $1.06  billion.  </P> <P> Bilzerian, who headed the company until shortly before the Chapter 11 filing,  was convicted in May, 1989, of concealing stock purchases in several  unsuccessful corporate takeover attempts.  </P></p>

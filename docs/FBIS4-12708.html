			<p>BFN     [Text] Islamabad, April 8 -- Foreign Minister Sardar Asif  Ahmad Ali on Friday ruled out any compromise on Pakistan's  supreme national interests and assured that all the decisions on  the foreign front will be made in the light of national  aspirations.    In a TV panel discussion Sardar Asif dealt at length with  the  entire spectrum of the foreign policy.    He said the American non-papers are not the official stand  of  the US administration. But during the on-going visit of US  Assistant Secretary of State Strobe Talbott both sides will  exchange their official stands on the irritants in Pakistan-US  relations.    He said the US administration desires to bring its relations  with Pakistan on the level witnessed by the past. However,  there are some difficulties to achieve this objective and these  impediments are due to the stand by the US Congress. But the US  administration is trying hard to find some way out.    "We have got some proposals in this regard which will be  discussed with Talbott and both sides will try to shorten their  distance on their respective positions."    Foreign Minister clarified that the issue of F-16s is in no  way linked with Pakistan's nuclear programme.    "We had signed a contract with USA for the delivery of 71  F-16s fighter planes."    Reiterating Pakistan's stand on nuclear non-proliferation he  said we are absolutely against the proliferation of nuclear arms  in the region. Pakistan has offered many proposals like  five-nations talks on the nuclear issue.    "But until and unless India comes out with same spirit  nothing will happen unilaterally from Pakistan."    Sardar Asif said it is wrong to say that Pakistan failed to  achieve its objectives at the UN Commission for Human Rights  meeting in Geneva.    "The real objectives of the resolution were to reduce Indian  repression in held Kashmir, to internationalise the Kashmir  issue, focus world attention on the current Kashmir situation  and to remove the iron curtain weaved by India around Kashmir."  he explained.    He said sound ties with Islamic countries are still the  major  plank of Pakistan's foreign policy. Trade relations with them  need further consolidation.    He rejected the impression that the present government has  ignored the Central Asian Region for further diplomatic  initiatives.    "Pakistan enjoys sound relations with these republics on all  levels. The trouble in Afghanistan is the main hurdle to make  further improvement but we we are not disappointed".    He hoped peace would return to Afghanistan this year.    He said Karakoram highway will be used for trade and railway  track will also be laid down on the same route.    In Afghanistan, be said the main problem was to end the  blockade of food supply to Kabul which was achieved by his two  visits to Afghan capital.</p>

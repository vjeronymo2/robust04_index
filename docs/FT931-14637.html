			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Arts: Comeback for Czech conductor - Andrew Clark talks to Martin Turnovsky FOR MORE than 20 years, the Czech conductor Martin Turnovsky was cold-shouldered by artist agencies in the west. The Communist authorities in Czechoslovakia never forgave him for emigrating after the Soviet invasion in 1968, and put pressure on anyone who tried to engage him. As a result, he was unable to work in any of the world's major musical centres. Now 64, Turnovsky has begun to make up for lost time. The past year has seen him re-emerge as an inspirational force in Prague's opera and concert life, and this month he brings the Prague Symphony Orchestra on tour to Britain. Turnovsky was one of the most talented Czech musicians of his generation, but by his own admission, he has had a stop-go career. The son of music-loving parents in Prague, he spent the final months of the war in a Nazi concentration camp. He won the Besancon conductors' competition in 1958  -but Czechoslovakia's isolationist policy prevented him from travelling abroad for the next five years. He became music director in Dresden in 1966, but for most of the 1970s and 1980s was treated as a non-person in the Communist bloc. Today he has none of the recording contracts or high media profile of the star conductor. What he can offer instead is long experience, a broad repertoire, human warmth and the ability to get results - qualities instantly recognised by the Prague Symphony Orchestra when Turnovsky returned to the Czech capital in 1991 after 21 years' exile. His concerts lifted morale and playing standards. Here were all the virtues of old-world music-making - cleanly-sculpted performances, free of idiosyncracy or blemish. The integrated sound and unforced musicality Turnovsky drew from the orchestra seemed to tap a vital part of the Czech musical heritage. Few were surprised when Turnovsky was appointed chief conductor last year. Ironically, Turnovsky had received a similar offer in 1970. 'For a while after 1968, the government was still quite liberal,' he recalls. 'I had resigned my post in Dresden in protest at East Germany's collusion with the Soviet invasion, but we could still travel. When I conducted at the 1970 Prague Spring Festival, I was asked to succeed Vaclav Smetacek (the Prague Symphony Orchestra's music director). But by then the atmosphere had changed  -I realised it was our last chance to leave the country legally. It was a painful decision.' Turnovsky was denounced and given a prison sentence in his absence. He was dropped by international artist agencies, including Harold Holt in London, which were anxious to preserve their links with the Czech state concert agency - the source of a plentiful supply of cheap, high-quality musicians. 'Everything was poisoned'. He received a lifeline from George Szell, music director of the Cleveland Orchestra, who had befriended the Turnovsky family in Prague in the 1930s. His former teacher, Karel Ancerl, invited him to Toronto. Rafael Kubelik also helped. In 1975 he became music director of the Norwegian Opera Company in Oslo, and later moved to Bonn. His British opera debut came in 1988, when his Onegin with WNO was praised for its combination of passion and sensitivity. In recent years he has given a conducting class at the Musikhochschule in Graz and seen his sons prosper: one is principal bassoon of the Vienna Philharmonic, the other has a solo career as an oboeist. Since Turnovsky's return to Prague, he has conducted Otello at the Smetana Theatre (to be followed next month by Un ballo in maschera) and started rebuilding the Prague Symphony Orchestra's audiences. The financial rewards of such a commitment are few - which is probably why so few emigre musicians have returned on an extended basis. Nor can he escape the problems of an orchestra which is still coming to terms with the limits of democracy and the need to generate more income. But unlike the Czech Philharmonic, which is still divided over its appointment of a German, Gerd Albrecht, as music director, the Prague Symphony Orchestra knew its chief selling point was its Czech tradition. 'They asked me to work with them, and if they think I can help, it's my duty,' says Turnovsky. 'The musicians realise they now live in a competitive world, so there's a special effort. The potential is great. Technically they're playing well, but I'm trying to get the strings to play with more heart and a wider dynamic range.' The programmes for the British tour were arranged before Turnovsky's appointment, and include the usual helping of Smetana and Dvorak, plus the two Brahms string concertos. Turnovsky would have liked to include a Martinu symphony, but is pleased at the amount of Janacek: Newcastle and Leeds, for example, will hear the Talich arrangement of the Suite from The Cunning Little Vixen, while the London concert at the Royal Festival Hall on January 24 includes the Glagolitic Mass. Turnovsky counts it as 'one of the most exciting pieces written this century - and also one of the most complicated. The first time I heard it was in Prague, conducted by the young Kubelik. It was an overwhelming experience for me. I hope it will have the same effect when we play it in London.' The Prague Symphony Orchestra's tour (January 21-30) opens in Dublin and continues to Eastbourne, Leeds, London, Newcastle, Huddersfield, Middlesborough and Birmingham.</p>

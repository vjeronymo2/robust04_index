			<p>BFN     [Text] Voices are being raised following Senator Bernard  Sansaricq's announcement that Court of Cassation Judge Emile  Jonassaint will be installed as president of the Republic on 11  May. Jean Guzman of the Haitian Revolutionary Party [PRH]  condemns the attitude of the head of the second Senate Office,  namely Bernard Sansaricq, who he says is trying to lead the  legislature onto a perilous path. He also let Chamber [of  Deputies] President Frantz Robert Monde have it! He thinks Monde  is letting himself be manipulated by Sen. Sansaricq. Guzman,  leader of the PRH, calls the president of the Chamber of  Deputies a traveler without a destination.</p>

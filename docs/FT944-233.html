			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Australia Is Australia about to embark on another vicious boom bust cycle? With bond yields in excess of 10 per cent, investors appear to have reached their conclusions already. The chief worry is inflation, even though it is running below 3 per cent. Interest rates have been raised by 2.75 percentage points since mid-August and tax increases are in the pipeline, but this may not be enough to curb overheating. The drought has not prevented the economy growing at 5 per cent. The reliance on commodities, which account for more than 60 per cent of exports, limits the effectiveness of monetary or fiscal policy as a way of controlling economic growth. Memories of the last recession may have contributed to an over-reaction. The current account deficit is a concern, but the drought has restrained exports, while import growth has been partially stimulated by capital equipment expenditure. This provides further evidence that industry has learnt from previous cycles, and is increasing investment to retain competitiveness. Inflation should peak at 5.5 per cent in late 1996, not enough to justify current bond yields. Industrial stocks already look undervalued on earnings estimates for the next two years. The Australian dollar is tied to commodity prices, and is likely to strengthen steadily. An excessive appreciation would, of course, erode industrial competitiveness in the longer term, but a strengthening dollar should attract overseas cash, providing further support for the markets. Shares, down 17 per cent since February, look over sold.</p>

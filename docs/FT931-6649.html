			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / Compulsory register proposed PLANS FOR a compulsory register of the 1m largest UK businesses were announced yesterday by chambers of commerce, Charles Batchelor writes. The register would allow the government to gather more accurate information about business and improve communications between government and the business community, the chambers said. It would also allow a streamlining of the procedures by which many businesses are required to obtain a licence before they can trade. The business registration centres, which would be based in chambers, could act as a single application point. The register would cover about 1m companies, partnerships, co-operatives and sole traders, and so would be more extensive than records kept at Companies House. But it would not cover the smallest businesses. The government has welcomed the proposal as a means of reducing the burden of red tape on business.</p>

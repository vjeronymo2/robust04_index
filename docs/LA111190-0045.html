			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOT SPOTS ON BRITISH ROCK TRAIL  </P> <P> Screaming Lord Sutch stood on a Soho district sidewalk one recent afternoon  doing what he does best -- screaming.  </P> <P> "Tony Sheridan taught the Beatles everything they know," he yelled into a  megaphone, while the crowd around him admired his sentiments and sparkly,  tiger-print suit.  </P> <P> It was a special day for Lord Sutch, the veteran musician and head of the  Raving Looney political party, and a graying pack of fellow pre-Beatle pop  stars who had gathered to pay tribute to the spawning ground of British rock  'n' roll.  </P> <P> An official Harp Beat Rock Plaque was being unveiled to commemorate the former  site of the legendary 2 I's Club, the tiny coffeehouse where England's original  rockers got their start. A restaurant called Le Bistingo now occupies the  premises at 59 Old Compton St.  </P> <P> The Soho ceremony was part of an ongoing program to put up plaques at sites of  historical significance to British rock music.  </P> <P> Previously honored with plaques were the Widnes railway station in the county  of Chesire, where Paul Simon wrote "Homeward Bound" in 1965, and the town hall  in Walsall, some 150 miles northwest of London, where Slade played its first  concert.  </P> <P> The plaque project is an offshoot of a remarkable book published last year,  called the "Harp Beat Rock Gazetteer of Great Britain," by rock historian Pete  Frame. (Harp is the beer company that sponsors the project.)  </P> <P> Organized city by city, Frame's guide compiled hundreds of listings noting  births, deaths, important gigs, scandals and other bits of fascinating rock  history and trivia.  </P> <P> "It's like a normal gazetteer," says Frame, standing amid the Soho hubbub,  "except it doesn't show you where castles are and where monks are and where  Henry the VIII got his head cut off and things like that. It tells you where  Keith Moon burned hotels, where P. J. Proby split his pants and where Screaming  Lord Sutch, there" -- he points across the room to the loudest person -- "won  election campaigns and things like that."  </P> <P> After the book came out, Frame said, he and the publishers decided it would be  a good idea to put up plaques at landmark sites.  </P> <P> "All over England we have these plaques that tell you where novelists and  scientists and politicians or whatever lived," he said. Frame and his  publishers decided that rock 'n' roll, with all its cultural importance to  Britain, should be included.  </P> <P> Few places seemed as deserving of a plaque as the 2 I's. "This is the  birthplace of English rock 'n' roll," says Frame. Tommy Steele was discovered  there in 1956. Cliff Richard played there under his real name, Harry Webb.  Lionel Bart, who wrote rock songs before composing musicals such as "Oliver,"  had painted murals on the club's walls.  </P> <P> Gary Glitter, whose career peaked in the early '70s, was playing there under  the name of Paul Raven in the early '60s. (His rendition of "Walk on By" was a  big hit in the Middle East in 1961.)  </P> <P> Dressed all in leather for the plaque ceremony, Glitter sang a rap song he'd  apparently just written. Later, Lord Sutch joined him for an a cappella "Whole  Lotta Shakin' Going On."  </P> <P> Adam Faith, in a conservative suit, recalled that more than 150 people used to  crowd into the living-room-size club. "It would get so hot," he recalled, "that  people would faint and would have to be carried outside."  </P> <P> "And they'd make them pay to get back in again," cracked the ubiquitous Lord  Sutch.  </P> <P> "The 2 I's became the magic place of its time," said Paul Lincoln, who  co-founded the club in 1956. He recalled how American stars -- Connie Francis  and Paul Anka among them -- used to drop in when they were in London.  </P> <P> Lincoln even helped launch the music career of Kris Kristofferson, who was  attending Oxford University in the late '50s. The American won a music  competition at the club, but Lincoln, who began managing him, made him change  his name to Kris Carson.  </P> <P> "I told him, 'You'll never make it with the name Kristofferson,' " said  Lincoln.  </P> <P> Frame, who is also noted for his genealogy books of rock family trees, says  he's not certain where the next rock plaque will go up. A likely spot is the  east London gas station where the Rolling Stones were cited and fined for  urinating on a wall in June, 1965.  </P> <P> "They were coming back from a gig," says Frame, "and they stopped at a petrol  station to (urinate) and the bloke there said, 'Sorry, we're not opening up the  loo for you.' So they said, 'All right, we'll (urinate) on the wall,' and he  went in and called the cops and they got fined. Of course, that just enhanced  their rebellious image."  </P> <P> Another possibility for a plaque is the Hope &amp; Anchor pub in the Islington  section of London (207 Upper St.).  </P> <P> According to Frame, the place was "pub rock Mecca" for more than a decade with  Stiff Records chief Dave Robinson running a recording studio inside and many  provincial bands, including U2 and Joy Division, making their London debuts  there.  </P> <P> One of Frame's favorite nuggets of Brit rock esoterica -- and another prime  candidate for a plaque -- is the Fox and Hounds pub in Caversham (Berkshire  County), where Paul McCartney and John Lennon spent a week's holiday in April,  1960.  </P> <P> McCartney's cousin ran the place and the two future legends played an Everly  Brothers-style acoustic set there, billing themselves as the Nurk Twins.  </P> <P> But maybe Frame and the others behind the Harp Beat Rock Plaque scheme will  decide on something a bit more obscure for the next commemorative ceremony? How  about the spot in Birkenhead, near Liverpool, where idiosyncratic mid-'80s cult  favorites Half Man Half Biscuit turned down a television appearance because  their favorite soccer team, the Tranmere Rovers, were playing at home that  night?  </P></p>

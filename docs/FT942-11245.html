			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Touche Ross to sue BCCI directors Liquidators to the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International are suing the bank's directors for failing in their duties, it emerged yesterday. The action is significant because it is the first move against the board members of BCCI, which was closed by regulators in July 1991 after evidence emerged of widespread fraud. It comes on top of litigation to recover funds for creditors brought by the liquidators against BCCI's auditors, the Bank of England and Sheikh Khalid bin Mahfouz and National Commercial Bank of Saudi Arabia. Partners from Touche Ross, the accountancy firm, issued the writ in the past few weeks through the Luxembourg courts because this is where the BCCI holding company is registered. Those named in the writ include Mr Alfred Hartman, Mr Cliff Twitchen, Mr Yves Lamarche, Mr J D Van Oenen and Sheikh Khalid, former chief operating officer of National Commercial Bank. However, one director, Mr Ghanim Faris Al Mazrui, the representative on the BCCI board since the early 1980s of the government of Abu Dhabi, the majority shareholder in the bank, has not been named. The decision to avoid including his name reflects an attempt by the liquidators to prevent any difficulties in finalising an agreement with Abu Dhabi over a payment of Dollars 1.8bn (Pounds 1.2bn) in exchange for a waiver of future legal action. But the liquidators are believed not to discount the possibility of adding Mr Mazrui's name in the future if the agreement with Abu Dhabi ultimately founders. The writ is not a public document, and is couched in general terms alleging that the directors failed in their duties under Luxembourg company law. It is not expected to advance quickly to hearings. In an interview with the Financial Times in February, Mr Mazrui protested his innocence in spite of his tenure on the BCCI board for 10 years. Mr Hartman said yesterday: 'If anything happens the directors will defend themselves. They were not aware of the fraud.' The other directors could not be contacted for comment. The liquidators continue to negotiate with the BCCI creditors' committee and the government of Abu Dhabi over the details of an agreement tentatively approved in March. Meanwhile, accountants Price Waterhouse and Ernst &amp; Whinney, now part of Ernst &amp; Young, filed their defences to a claim for up to Dollars 11bn for their allegedly faulty auditing of BCCI.</p>

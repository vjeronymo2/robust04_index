			<p><P> October 24, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> VALLEY CENTER AT CROSSROAD ON GROWTH  </P> <P> It was big news in Valley Center when, just a few weeks ago, the first traffic  light was installed along the main drag.  </P> <P> It was a symbol, literally, of a little town growing up and of the debate now  taking place among townsfolk about the area's future.  </P> <P> The San Diego County Board of Supervisors today will decide how much growth  will be permitted in Valley Center while still preserving the rural ambience of  the small community northeast of Escondido.  </P> <P> The town's dominating faction wants significantly fewer homes built than were  allowed in a 1984 community plan. Others, though, say more homes -- and  businesses -- are needed to ensure the town's integrity.  </P> <P> Many people move to Valley Center because they are smitten by country living  and horizons marked by ridgelines, not rooftops. Homes are on minimum 2-acre or  4-acre lots. There's no big business here, no grocery store, no shopping mall.  </P> <P> Some of those people fear that the county wants to transform Valley Center into  -- egads! -- Uptown Escondido.  </P> <P> They fear that Escondido's Valley Parkway, with its retail stores and  apartments and mobile home parks, will snake up the grade to the northeast and  keep flowing right down Valley Center Road like some awful run-on sentence.  </P> <P> Others say Valley Center must expand its commercial base and housing  opportunities, or else the town is destined to become too elite for senior  citizens or low-income families, and the rural residents will continue to have  to motor to Escondido for most of their services and goods.  </P> <P> Given those two opposing visions for Valley Center's future, county supervisors  today will be asked to adopt a new community plan that will guide Valley  Center's residential and commercial growth for the next 20 years.  </P> <P> But this bureaucratic exercise comes with a twist. The advisory Valley Center  community planning group has proposed a growth plan that dramatically reduces  previously planned residential development and resists commercial retail  growth.  </P> <P> The planning group, dominated by a slate of slow-growth champions elected two  years ago, wants two relatively high-density residential and commercial  neighborhoods, or "country towns," developed along Valley Center Road -- one at  Woods Valley Road, the other about 4 miles away at Cole Grade Road. In those  areas, homes could be built on lots as small as a half-acre -- if and when  sewers are brought to Valley Center to serve them.  </P> <P> The San Diego County Planning Commission and the county's own planning staff  agreed with the thrust of the new plan.  </P> <P> But Supervisor Brian Bilbray, who represents South County, sees a different  future for Valley Center.  </P> <P> He argues for greater commercial and residential growth along Valley Center  Road -- a "linkage" between the two town centers reflecting more intense land  uses.  </P> <P> "To think there will be low-density residential along Valley Center Road  between those two nodes is to stick your head in the sand," he says. "Dynamics  will be created along that road."  </P> <P> Indeed, Valley Center's 1984 community plan called for some frontage property  along the road to be zoned for as many as 7.4 homes per acre -- not urban  density but, nonetheless, 15 times more homes per acre than is now allowed  along the two-lane highway.  </P> <P> That plan called for a 2,337-acre country town, contrasted with the current  proposal for two smaller ones totaling just 662 acres. More telling, the old  plan called for as many as 3,800 homes within the country town boundaries; the  new one calls for a maximum of 485.  </P> <P> The 1984 plan assumed that the center of Valley Center would be served by  sewers. The town is now served exclusively by septic tanks -- and because of  high ground water, a moratorium was issued in 1980 on any new development in  the center of town because the ground couldn't handle any more sewage  percolation from leach lines.  </P> <P> In 1986, Valley Center water district officials, armed with a large federal  grant that would have picked up most of the tab, were ready to bring in sewers.  But strong opposition surfaced, a public vote was conducted and the sewers were  rejected.  </P> <P> To this day, the building moratorium remains in place, there has been no new  growth in the central part of Valley Center, and the debate about the benefits  and liabilities of sewers continues.  </P> <P> Bilbray and others say those sewers are inevitable, and want a community plan  developed that will allow a greater number of homes, once the sewers are  installed, as well as more commercial businesses.  </P> <P> Bilbray is not without local support.  </P> <P> Local egg rancher George Armstrong, who served on the Valley Center planning  group for 19 years and championed the 1984 growth plan, said commercial and  residential growth needs to be better concentrated along Valley Center Road in  order to preserve the rural settings farther out of town.  </P> <P> Besides, he says, without higher-density -- and less expensive, and  easier-to-maintain -- housing, "the seniors who live in Valley Center are going  to be squeezed out. And that's 39% of our population base" of about 12,000  people.  </P> <P> "And there's no way for young families to afford 2-acre estates up here," he  said. "I'd personally be better off if no one moved up here, because chickens  and houses are not very compatible. But we have to realize what's necessary to  make a good, well-balanced community."  </P> <P> Realtor Alan Dorris agrees.  </P> <P> "I can make a fine living either way -- whether I sell 10 $500,000 homes or 50  $100,000 homes," he said. "But I don't want to just sell upscale, Rancho Santa  Fe-type properties in Valley Center. I want a complete community that  represents the entire population. I don't want to see an elitist-type town."  </P> <P> Ted Marioncelli agrees, too. A former aide to Supervisor John MacDonald,  Marioncelli now consults for developers, including one who wants to build in  Valley Center -- and whose plans are in jeopardy.  </P> <P> "Because of the 10-year-old sewer moratorium, there's a pent-up demand (to  grow) in Valley Center. You can live there and enjoy the rural life -- and  drive to work somewhere else. Well, I don't see the kinds of development that's  being proposed out there jeopardizing that life style.  </P> <P> "In fact, it will enhance it. These developments can bring in horse trails,  golf courses, public parks -- the kinds of amenities that Valley Center  wouldn't otherwise get," Marioncelli contended.  </P> <P> The counter arguments are offered by the likes of Kevin Mahan, an attorney who  serves as chairman of the Valley Center planning group; Craig Johnson, who  spearheaded the opposition to sewers, and Lynn Leichtfuss, a Valley Center  resident who also serves as chairman of the county Planning Commission.  </P> <P> "There are maybe 300 people in Valley Center who are in favor of high density,  high growth and strip commercial -- the people who own the businesses along  Valley Center Road and the landowners who hope to get tremendous returns on  their property," said Mahan. "But I look at Valley Center like living in a  Norman Rockwell painting, and (the 1984 growth plan) would destroy that, maybe  not this year or next but in the next five or 10. You wouldn't recognize this  place. It would be like living in an elevated Escondido."  </P> <P> Johnson said: "Bilbray is operating on a system of mediocrity, in trying to  make sure each community is numerically responsible in terms of regional  planning. People move here in order to not live where they work. Why take that  from us? It's not that we're elitists, but we do believe we have a right to a  rural community somewhere in this county. Bilbray would have the entire county  bulldozed."  </P> <P> Said Leichtfuss: "It's very difficult for me to understand, when you have three  bodies in concert, working to develop a plan and being in agreement, that one  supervisor can try to throw a wrench in the works and cause a good deal of  confusion and animosity in the community. The mechanics, and the notion of  democratic representation, seem to have broken down."  </P> <P> She said she has no conceptual problem with two separated country town centers.  "That makes perfect sense for rural living," she said. "Let's use some  ingenuity."  </P> <P> For his part, John MacDonald -- whose district includes Valley Center -- is  withholding comment because "not all the evidence is on the table," said his  chief of staff, Nancy Allen.  </P> <P> "But he's very concerned about a strip-commercial atmosphere. We don't want  Valley Center covered in neon," she said.  </P> <P> One option to pursue, she suggested, is a mixed commercial-residential use  along Valley Center Road, allowing small businesses to operate with persons  living upstairs, something akin to an artist's loft.  </P> <P> "Valley Center doesn't have too much commercial now, but, on the other hand,  there's not much existing base to support it," Allen said. "You probably won't  find a supermarket in Valley Center for a while.  </P> <P> "People who move to Valley Center don't anticipate having all those kinds of  amenities. When they move out there, it's with the understanding they'll have  to drive down the hill (into Escondido) for that."  </P> <P> Are developers licking their chops to develop Valley Center? "Well, I overheard  a conversation in the hallway the other day," Allen offered. "A developer was  saying, 'There's land out there screaming, Grade me! Grade me!' "  </P></p>

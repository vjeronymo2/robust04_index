			<p><P> December 26, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Phone Call Foul-Up: About 25,000 families and friends of people serving in the  Persian Gulf were mistakenly billed for calls that were supposed to be free,  and the charges will be canceled, AT&amp;T officials said.  </P> <P> American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. had offered to let servicemen and women  in the gulf make the free calls during Thanksgiving week, and 140,000 calls  were made. But some local phone companies did not follow through on  instructions not to bill the troops' families for these calls, AT&amp;T said.  No one will have to pay for the bills, no matter how high they were, AT&amp;T  added.  </P></p>

			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Aluminium jumps to fresh peak After a week of concentrating on the consolidation of recent gains most London Metal Exchange contracts finished near the top of their trading ranges. Aluminium was the star performer, the three months position jumping yesterday to a 39-month high of Dollars 1,541 a tonne. It closed at Dollars 1,539.50, up Dollars 33 on the day and Dollars 29 on the week. Traders attributed the late strength to bouts of speculative buying, some of it related to options-market activity. There was also some short-covering by operators who had gambled on the earlier price decline continuing. With the metal's fundamentals expected to improve as output cuts following January's international agreement make further inroads into stocks some dealers told the Reuter news agency that a test of resistance around the Dollars 1,550-a-tonne mark was likely soon. Copper was also strong yesterday. The three months position's ended only Dollars 26 up on the week at Dollars 2,467.50 a tonne but that was a great improvement on the Dollars 2,390 reached at one stage on Thursday as the market was hit by selling from speculators and US investment funds. On the other hand, it was Dollars 25 short of the week's peak, reached on Tuesday. 'Copper should still head higher after bouncing yesterday,' one dealer told Reuter. 'But it will have to soak up all the overhead selling.' Another LME market to show renewed buoyancy yesterday was lead. As copper's rally removed the constraints that had prevented the metal's improving fundamentals having their full effect on market sentiment the three months price surged Dollars 25 yesterday to a 22-month peak of Dollars 601 a tonne. Consolidation was the name of the game for the coffee market for most of this week. After the recent spectacular surge to 7 1/2 -year highs the September futures position at the London Commodity Exchange traded in a relatively narrow Dollars 175 trading range. It ended the week at Dollars 3,077 a tonne, Dollars 121 down overall. The price had been sent lower on Thursday by news that Brazil planned to sell 5m bags (60kg each) on its domestic market to calm prices. And early jitters yesterday about the possibility of another damaging frost in that country - which lifted the price to Dollars 3,153 at one stage - had calmed down by the close of trading. The cocoa market bounced yesterday, with the LCE September quotation ending at Dollars 1,016 tonne, up Dollars 22 on the day and Dollars 12 on the week. Prices were initially depressed by the publication of disappointing second quarter bean grinding figures for Germany and the UK. But with the market showing what one dealer described as 'a marked reluctance to find sellers', nervousness about looming supply tightness in the September-March period was enough to prompt a Dollars 32 rally. The latest cocoa grind figures have nevertheless further eroded what remains of the market's bullish sentiment. They might indicate that business in Europe was not as good as some people had been say it was, confectionery manufacturers and traders told Reuter. 'They show perhaps that the recession is still deeper than a lot of people think, and that people are preferring to save up money for holidays rather than spend it on the finer things in life,' said one manufacturer. The German grind for the second quarter was 2.5 per cent below the same three months last year, while the British figure was 6.9 per cent down.  ----------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Thursday's close) tonnes  ----------------------------------------- Aluminium           -3,350 to 2,587,750 Aluminium alloy       -420 to    29,140 Copper              -3,125 to   347,800 Lead                +1,975 to   355,925 Nickel                 +12 to   132,762 Zinc                  +625 to 1,197,325 Tin                   -160 to    30,730  -----------------------------------------</p>

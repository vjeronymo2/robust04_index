Shuklin; Typhoon Scientific Production Association;  manuscript submitted 17 Mar 93; UDC 551.521.3:551.576.1]    [Abstract] Amplitude-time responses were measured for  optical pulses vertically propagated through stratified clouds.  ATR measurements were complemented by a sounding of the optical  and microphysical parameters of the cloud cover. The experiments  were carried out in the fall of 1988 and the spring of 1989 in  the area around the Typhoon Production Association's  high-altitude weather station near Obninsk. Twelve series of  measurements under different types of cloud cover were carried  out. The laser radiation source was carried on board an  Ilyushin-14 aircraft and had a wavelength of 0.532 m, a beam  divergence of 10, a pulse length of 10 ns, and a repetition  rate of 10 Hz. The plane, which flew above the clouds at an  altitude of 2-4 km, was guided to the observation point by a  Meteorite-2 meteorological radar station. The propagated  radiation was recorded by a ground-based 4-channel lens system  with a focal length of 160-300 mm, an aperture diameter of 120  mm, and receiving angles set at 5 and 20. The time  resolution of the transmission/receiving system equaled 30 ns.  Comparison of the ATR data with numerical calculations performed  using the Monte Carlo method showed that a cloud stratification  model constructed as a set of homogeneous layers with a  scattering indicatrix typical for stratified clouds allowed for  a satisfactory interpretation of the experimental data. The  fundamental parameter determining ATR is the optical thickness  of the cloud cover. The variations in ATR observed for different  optical thicknesses (_t_  25) were attributed to the  combined  effects of various geometrical parameters such as distance from  source to receiver, cloud ceiling altitude, thickness of the  cloud strata, and so forth.

			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Mental health review announced AN urgent review is to be conducted into whether new legal powers are needed to ensure that the mentally ill get proper care in the community, Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, said last night. In a Commons written reply, Mrs Bottomley said that the Royal College of Psychiatrists had recommended the 1983 Mental Health Act should be amended to provide for a community supervision order. That would apply for patients repeatedly admitted to hospital who needed long-term support in the community but had a history of failing to co-operate with treatment. 'We do need to address, as a priority, whether we are doing enough to ensure that these vulnerable people keep in contact with the services available,' Mrs Bottomley said.</p>

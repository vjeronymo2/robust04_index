			<p><P> July 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INTRODUCING: ATLANTA'S MARY MY HOPE: 'OPTIMISTIC NIHILISM'  </P> <P> Band: Mary My Hope Personnel: Clinton Steele, guitar; James Hall, vocals,  guitar; Sven Pipien, bass; Steven Lindenbaum, drums.  </P> <P> History: Steele hooked up with German-born Pipien in Atlanta two years ago.  After dropping out of college to concentrate on music, the duo recruited Hall  and found Lindenbaum through an ad begging release from heavy-metal monotony.  Taking its name from a religious tract, Mary My Hope made a distinctive mark in  the Atlanta scene, eventually drawing the attention of Andrew Lauder, the  former head of England's Demon Records (who originally signed Elvis Costello).  Lauder signed the group to his new, RCA-distributed Silvertone label. M.M.H.  recorded its debut album, "Museum," in Wales with producer Hugh Jones (Echo  &amp; the Bunnymen). The band recently toured America with Jane's Addiction.  </P> <P> Sound: Taking the stairway to arena rock heaven, Mary My Hope is a true acolyte  of rock mythology; its more thundering moments reveal the fall-out of  devotional hours spent listening to the Doors, Led Zeppelin, the Beatles,  AC/DC, David Bowie, Pink Floyd and even INXS. These might be diverse-style  icons, but Mary My Hope has no problem with stylistic purity. Though capable of  blistering, straight-ahead rockers ("Hourglass"), the group has a predilection  toward epic drama-songs such as the band's signature, "Suicide King," which  rises from a plaintive acoustic opening to a sonic meltdown, complete with  crashing walls of chords and Hall's Robert Plant-like wailing. Thematically the  group runs the gamut of what Steele describes as "optimistic nihilism," with  lots of crypto-mystical musings about spiritual salvation and death. Still  young and naive enough (the oldest band member is 23) to trim the fat off  dinosaur art-rock leftovers, Mary My Hope stands poised between metallic  rapture and an unholy mess.  </P> <P> Shows: Monday, the Palace (with the Godfathers).

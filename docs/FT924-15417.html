			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / Regional aid review THE MID WALES Rural Development Forum has urged the government to extend the area within mid Wales eligible for regional assistance under its regional aid review. The forum - comprising the Development Board for Rural Wales, the three county councils in its area, five district councils and three Training and Enterprise Councils - is a lobbying group for more business investment in rural mid Wales. Four areas in mid Wales have assisted-area status: around Brecon and south of Cardigan are development areas; while north-west Meirionnydd and parts of Ystradgynlais, above Swansea, are lower-rated intermediate areas. The rest of rural mid Wales, which has suffered in the past few years from the drop in farming income, is not designated for any form of assistance. The forum is pressing for the upgrading of north-west Meirionnydd, around the Trawsfynydd nuclear power station, which is threatened with closure with the loss of some 600 jobs, to development-area status. Mr RO Lewis, chairman of the forum, said there was 'a special case for north-west Meirionnydd, given the area's dependence on the power station'.</p>

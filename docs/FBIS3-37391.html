The committee held hearings Tuesday on the possible  escalation of the conflict in the former Yugoslavia. The  restoration of a single democratic state is the sole way to  discontinue the military, political, economic and inter-ethnic  crisis in the republics of the former Yugoslavia, says the  resolution.    The document says that the implementation of a NATO decision  on air strike against the Serb positions near Sarajevo should be  considered as an act of international terrorism.    The Russian president is proposed to use his right of veto  at  the UN Security Council, as well as lift economic sanctions,  imposed by Russia against Yugoslavia.    Representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry, Vladimir  Ivanovskiy, told deputies that the UN resolution on Yugoslavia  puts responsibility for unblocking Sarajevo on the UN Secretary  General and it is not necessary to convene the Security Council  to take decision on air raids. This means that the use by  Russia of its right to veto could be discussed only  "hypothetically", he said. The UN resolution, said Ivanovskiy,  allows the use of the military force only if there is threat to  the safety zones, including Sarajevo, and to the relief convoys  and UN peacekeepers.</p>

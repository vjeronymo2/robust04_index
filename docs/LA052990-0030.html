			<p><P> May 29, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SCHOOL DISTRICTS SAY PROPOSED STATE BUDGET CUTS THREATEN PROGRAMS;  </P> <P> RAISES: OFFICIALS FORM A COALITION AND APPEAL TO GOV. DEUKMEJIAN TO INCREASE  THE COST-OF-LIVING ALLOCATION TO 4.8%.  </P> <P> Officials from four eastern Ventura County school districts say their districts  face a potential financial crisis that could threaten their survival if the  state budget proposed by Gov. George Deukmejian is approved.  </P> <P> The officials said if they are given a 3% cost-of-living adjustment, as the  budget proposes, instead of a 4.8% increase reflecting the actual anticipated  cost increases in the next year, they will have to slash funding for some  programs.  </P> <P> Although some district officials said they have not decided which programs may  have to be cut, reductions could affect some extracurricular activities, job  training programs and those that provide help for potential dropouts. Decreased  funding would also affect everything from class size to facilities.  </P> <P> Officials from the Conejo Valley, Simi Valley, Oak Park and Moorpark unified  districts presented the bleak picture at a news conference earlier this month  in Thousand Oaks. They were joined by a representative of the Las Virgenes  Unified School District in Los Angeles County.  </P> <P> Collectively, the five districts, which represent 50,000 students, stand to  lose more than $3.5 million in state funding next year if they receive the 3%  cost-of-living adjustment.  </P> <P> The loss in revenue comes at a time when several Ventura County districts are  already facing budget shortfalls. The Simi Valley district has decided to lay  off 32 temporary teachers and reassign some administrators to lower-paying  positions to offset a projected $8.5-million shortfall.  </P> <P> Budget shortfalls have not been restricted to schools. Last week, Deukmejian  announced that the state is expecting a $3.6-billion budget shortfall for the  1990-91 fiscal year.  </P> <P> In recent years, schools have received budgetary increases from the state that  kept pace with the cost-of-living increases projected by the Commission on  State Finance. This year, however, state officials have proposed an increase  less than the inflation rate because of the projected state shortfall.  </P> <P> The effect of the state's projected budget on school districts "has been very,  very disappointing -- it's been miserable, as a matter of fact," said Helen  Beebe, board president of the Simi Valley Unified District.  </P> <P> "We had anticipated a continuance" of the statutory cost-of-living increase of  4.8%, Beebe said. "We had anticipated funding for programs that were mandated  upon us in prior years. We had not anticipated cutbacks in these areas. The  erosion of funding has caused us all to suffer a budgetary crunch that is very,  very difficult, and if it gets any worse it could be almost non-survivable."  </P> <P> If the funding decline continues, some districts could eventually face  bankruptcy, Beebe said, "and you may be looking at five of them right here."  The five districts have formed a coalition, called the Suburban Schools State  Budget Coalition of Ventura and Los Angeles Counties. After the news  conference, the coalition, along with school representatives from Santa Barbara  and San Luis Obispo counties, planned to hand-deliver a letter to Deukmejian  expressing their concerns about the budget.  </P> <P> "We cannot wait until June and July to plan next year's programs and staffing,"  the letter said. "We are moving forward in a cutting mode which is disastrous  for morale and the continuity of education. Therefore, there is an urgency in  amending the proposed budget."  </P> <P> In a position statement, the coalition urged the full 4.8% cost-of-living  increase and recommended that existing school programs continue to be fully  funded before any new programs are begun.  </P> <P> "We believe this is possible by rearranging existing funding priorities within  the budget and without exceeding the total dollar allotment the governor has  already set aside for education," the letter said.  </P> <P> The letter was signed by representatives of the board, teachers' groups,  management and classified employees from each district.  </P> <P> At the news conference, officials also decried the use of funds from  Proposition 98, which was intended to give schools more tax revenues in  exchange for better accountability, and from the California Lottery. Money from  Proposition 98, for example, which was intended to fund supplemental  educational programs, has in some cases been used for basic expenses such as  medical insurance, officials said.  </P> <P> "They were intended to be used as icing on the cake," said Karen Lough, a  science teacher and president of the Las Virgenes Educators Assn. "That has not  happened."  </P> <P> Statewide, the lottery generates about 3% of total school revenues.  </P> <P> Officials said the proposed budget cuts come at a bad time because many  districts, including Moorpark and Oak Park, are facing enrollment increases and  need new schools.  </P> <P> Oak Park Supt. Susan Hearn said a new elementary school was built in her  district only last year, but just this month officials had to place two  portable classrooms on the campus to accommodate growth.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Business News Weekly" feature, 30 May-5 Jun 94] </F>   [Text] The Ukrainian Verkhovna Rada (parliament) passed a  law, which amended the Cabinet's decree on foreign investment  procedures. The law changed Articles 3 and 4, which had provided  for foreign investors' right to effect investment in Ukraine in  the form of any movable or immovable property including land  (Article 3), and their right to all types of investments, which  involve six forms including the form of acquisition, not  directly prohibited by Ukraine's legislation, of any movables  and immovables including land plots (Article 4). The new law  nullifies investors' right to land.    Besides, Article 42 on proprietorial rights to land and  other  natural resources now specifies that "obtaining by foreign  investors of proprietorial rights to natural resources is  regulated by Ukraine's legislation." The Cabinet's decree  provided for more specific regulation of such rights, in  particular, by the Land Code of Ukraine.    The Cabinet's decree was approved on 20 May 1993 (No. 55-93)  and was based on the laws on foreign economic activities and on  investment activities in Ukraine.    The law on making amendments to the Cabinet's decree on  foreign investment procedures was signed by President Kravchuk  on 2 February 1994. However, its text became available to the  media only on 4 June 1994.</p>

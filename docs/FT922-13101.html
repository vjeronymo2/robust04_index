			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report ZINC and ALUMINIUM prices were unable to hang on to early gains on the LME. Zinc ran into profit taking and resistance when the three-month price neared Dollars 1,300 a tonne. The early gains in aluminium followed news that Russia's government had offered to resign, prompting short covering, with traders concerned over possible disruptions to metal shipments. However, there was no follow-through buying. A rise of up to 4,000 tonnes is expected today in LME warehouse stocks. GOLD also lost early gains made on the London bullion market on the Russian news. But US selling had undermined support in the Dollars 342 a troy ounce area, dealers said. The metal is expected to hold roughly between Dollars 338 and Dollars 343 ahead of the Easter holiday. On Comex gold futures were weaker at midsession after Chemical Bank lowered its prime rate. London COCOA edged ahead after news that the UK cocoa grind was 21.1 per cent up in the first quarter at 39,831 tonnes. Last week analysts were forecasting a gain of 8 per cent. 'It's always good to see a higher figure, but when you see the amount of cocoa which has still to be sold by origin countries, it's a bearish market,' one trader said. Compiled from Reuters</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sofia Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, June 4 (CNA) -- An unidentified submarine  was discovered off southwestern Taiwan during a late May  Republic of China [ROC] military exercise, naval authorities  said Saturday [4 June].    Testifying before the Legislative Yuan's Defense Committee,  Chou Ching-hung, chief of staff at the Navy General  Headquarters, said the ROC naval fleet contained the  unidentified submarine for 45 hours and 44 minutes.    Chou, however, did not say where the submarine was from.    He said the sub was in the open sea off Penghu when it was  spotted by an ROC S-2T anti-submarine aircraft participating in  the "Han Kuang" wargames.    Chou said sonar equipment installed on the Navy's  anti-submarine helicopters, destroyers and frigates was used to  pinpoint the sub.    The ROC Navy also used its underwater communications system  to send warning signals to the submarine and ask it to provide  its identity and nationality. The sub did not respond, Chou  said.    According to a CHINA TIMES report, the ROC naval fleet did  not attack the unidentified submarine because the vessel  remained in international waters and did not intrude into  Taiwan's 12-nautical mile territorial waters.    The Navy instead sent four destroyers and frigates to  contain  the submarine, the report said. The Navy also dispatched its  S70C anti-submarine helicopters to monitor the submarine.    The report said the submarine left the waters off Penghu on  the fourth day of the standoff after the four-ship ROC fleet  opened an exit.    The ROC did not mobilize its submarines to contain the  unidentified sub, the report said.    National Defense Minister Sun Chen refused comment on the  origin of the submarine and whether Mainland China sent the sub  to collect military information during the ROC military exercise.    Sun said the mainland has many submarines. "It surely would  use its submarines to collect military information in the Taiwan  Strait," he added.    Sun said the ROC Navy is capable of spotting unidentified  underwater targets and even attacking them. "Local people need  not worry about such incidents," he added.    Naval authorities said about 96 mainland submarines  regularly  sail the waters surrounding Taiwan. A mainland submarine was  spotted in waters 12.5 nautical miles off Anping in southern  Taiwan two months ago, the authorities said.</p>

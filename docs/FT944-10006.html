			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Markets): A honeymoon that lasted just three hours - Wall Street / Reality quick to replace euphoria after Republicans' landslide If the honeymoon between President Clinton and the new Republican-controlled Congress lasted little more than 24 hours this week, any affectionate thoughts the financial markets had about the Grand Old Party's mid-term election triumphs on Tuesday had an even shorter shelf-life - about three hours. That was how long it took for reality to set in on Wall Street after the Republicans wrested control of both houses of Congress, plus a string of state governorships, in an electoral landslide that left the Democratic party and the president reeling. The stock market's initial reaction to the elections was, unsurprisingly, positive. The Dow Jones Industrial Average leapt almost 40 points in the first hour of trading as traders and investors responded to the results in typical knee-jerk fashion: the Republican party is the pro-business party, and a Republican-run Congress will cut taxes to aid businesses and investors and take tough action to reduce government spending, all of which is good for stocks. The warm glow surrounding the election results dissipated quickly, however, as analysts and traders began to take a closer look at the Republicans who would take over leadership of the key legislative committees on Capitol Hill and their policies. This involved becoming acquainted with people such as Bill Archer, the new chairman of the all-powerful House Ways and Means committee, from where all US tax laws originate. Archer, as he explained on Thursday, wants to push a host of tax cuts through Congress and, ultimately, eliminate income taxes altogether. He, and other Republicans who outlined their plans eagerly this week, also want to increase defence spending significantly and pass a balanced budget amendment to force the government to eliminate the federal deficit. Unfortunately, few Republicans were willing to explain exactly where the huge spending reductions required to offset the tax cuts would come from, and how exactly they would balance the budget after spending billions more on defence - a feat that the Reagan administration never mastered during the 1980s. In the absence of any specific proposals on spending cuts, the markets were left to worry about the repercussions of Republican policy on the budget deficit, interest rates and the bond market. And none was particularly pleasing: if Republican actions boosted the size of the deficit, the government would have to borrow more money to finance it, which would probably lead to higher interest rates. It was this kind of thinking which prompted share prices to retreat from their highs on Wednesday and continue retreating on Thursday. Traders and investors were also troubled by suggestions that top Republican congressmen might block measures to liberalise international trade under Gatt (the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade); and by the likelihood that key banking and finance committees now under Republican control would widen significantly investigations into the Whitewater affair, potentially further weakening Clinton's position and undermining international investor confidence in the US. Above all, however, the markets were unsettled by the uncertainty surrounding Tuesday's political earthquake which placed the Senate and the House of Representatives in Republican hands for the first time in more than 40 years. While political pundits agreed universally that change on this scale was unprecedented in modern US political history, no one could explain convincingly what exactly it would mean for the immediate future. Would it lead to more or less gridlock? A bigger or smaller deficit? Higher or lower interest rates? A stronger or weaker economy? Amid all the doubts and unanswered questions, however, Wall Street was able to reassure itself with the thought that the one thing the Republicans did not win control of this week was monetary policy, which remains in the politically-independent hands of the Federal Reserve. Unfortunately, those hands are poised to squeeze monetary policy a little tighter next week when the Fed's open market committee meets to decide if it needs to raise interest rates again to restrain inflationary pressures in the economy. The markets are fully expecting the Fed to increase short-term rates by half a percentage point, to 4 1/4 per cent. Although the most recent economic data - an 0.5 per cent drop in October producer prices reported on Thursday - indicated that inflation remained unthreatening, the central bank appears determined to take every precautionary measure necessary. This sobering thought was, ultimately, behind the stock market's poor performance this week. For all the excitement of Tuesday's election results, traders and investors know that the most powerful figure in America this week is not Bob Dole, the new Republican leader of the Senate, or Newt Gingrich, the new Republican leader of the House - but Fed chairman Alan Greenspan.  ---------------------------------------- Monday        3,808.87        +1.35 Tuesday       3,830.74        +21.87 Wednesday     3,831.75        +1.01 Thursday      3,821.99        -9.76 Friday        3,801.47        -20.52  ----------------------------------------</p>

			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Electronic Data slips to Pounds 4.12m An increase in research and development costs led to pre-tax profits falling from Pounds 4.67m to Pounds 4.12m at Electronic Data Processing in the year to end-September. Turnover also fell slightly to Pounds 14m (Pounds 14.3m) reflecting the 'tough environment' at a time when the company was undergoing a period of transition, said Mr Michael Heller, chairman. In the course of the past three years the group has shifted from being a supplier of hardware and some software to being primarily a software publisher and services provider, he added. Research and development costs amounted to Pounds 1.57m (Pounds 1.41m) while net interest receivable fell from Pounds 563,000 to Pounds 540,000. Cash balances at the year end, however, had grown to Pounds 12.2m, compared with Pounds 10.9m at the beginning of the year. An increased final dividend of 1.333p is proposed making 2p (1.833p), payable from earnings of per share down from 11.71p to 10.21p.</p>

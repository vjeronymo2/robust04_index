			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Types of Grants Available and Funding Schedules  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The SJI grant program is designed to be responsive to the most important needs of the State courts. To meet the full range of the courts' diverse needs, the Institute offers six different types of grants. The types of grants available in FY 1995 and the funding cycles for each program are provided below:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Project Grants <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . These grants are awarded to support education, research, demonstration and technical assistance projects to improve the administration of justice in the State courts. With limited exceptions (see sections II.B.2.b.i. and II.c.), project grants are intended to support innovative projects of national significance. As provided in section V. of the Guideline, project grants may ordinarily not exceed $300,000 a year; however, grants in excess of $200,000 are likely to be awarded only to support projects likely to have a significant national impact. Applicants must ordinarily submit a concept paper (see section VI.) and an application (see section VII.) in order to obtain a project grant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As indicated in Section VI.C., the Board may make an ``accelerated'' project grant of less than $40,000 on the basis of the concept paper alone when the need for the project is clear and little additional information would be provided in an application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FY 1995 mailing deadline for project grant concept papers is November 23, 1994. Papers must be postmarked or bear other evidence of submission by that date. With two exceptions noted immediately below, the FY 1995 funding cycle will be substantially similar to the FY 1994 cycle: the Board will meet in early March, 1995 to invite formal applications based on the most promising concept papers; applications will be due in May; and awards will be approved by the Board in July.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The first exception to this schedule pertains to proposals to follow up on the National Conference on Mass Tort Litigation to be held in November, 1994. Applicants interested in participating in this special round of funding may submit concept papers proposing projects addressing the findings and recommendations of that conference by March 10, 1995. The papers will be considered by the Board at its meeting in April, 1995. Invited applications will be reviewed at the Board's July, 1995 meeting. See section II.B.2.l.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The second exception is for projects to follow up on the National Conference on Eliminating Race and Ethnic Bias in the Courts to be held March 2&hyph;5, 1995. Concept papers for projects to implement the State action plans developed at the conference must be mailed by October 6, 1995. See section II.B.2.i.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Package Grants <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . This grant program permits applicants to submit one concept paper (or application) for a ``package'' of related grants rather than separate proposals for each related component of the package. Package grants of up to $750,000 per year may be awarded to support projects that address interrelated topics or the core elements of a multifaceted program, or that require the services of all or some of the same key staff persons. Package grants must enhance (not merely maintain) an applicant's services and must otherwise meet the Institute's grant criteria. The Board retains the discretion to support all, none, or selected portions of the proposed package. Package grant concept papers and applications will be considered on the same schedule as project grants. See sections III.J., V.C. and D., VI.A.2.b. and 3.b., VII.A.3., VII.C., and VII.D. for more information about package grants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Technical Assistance Grants <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Under this program, a State or local court may receive a grant of up to $30,000 to engage outside experts to provide technical assistance to diagnose, develop, and implement a response to a jurisdiction's problems. The Guideline allocates up to $600,000 in FY 1995 funds to support technical assistance grants. See section II.C.2.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Curriculum Adaptation Grants <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . A grant of up to $20,000 may be awarded to a State or local court to replicate or modify a model training program developed with SJI funds. The Guideline allocates up to $350,000 for these grants in FY 1995, the same amount allocated in FY 1994. See section II.B.2.b.i.(b).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Like Technical Assistance grant applications, letters requesting Curriculum Adaptation grants may be submitted at any time during the fiscal year. However, in order to permit the Institute sufficient time to evaluate these proposals, letters must be submitted no later than 90 days before the projected date of the training program. See section II.B.2.b.i.(b).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Scholarships <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The Guideline allocates up to $250,000 of FY 1995 funds for scholarships to enable judges and court managers to attend out-of-State education and training programs. See section II.B.2.b.v.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / Arts: Emanuel Ax - Recital On Sunday afternoon in a well-filled Queen Elizabeth Hall, Ax offered a curiously salon-ish, undemanding programme: three French standards, and Schumann's Carnaval. After his distinguished account of Schoenberg's piano concerto with the Philharmonia, just two months ago, it promised a piquant contrast. Ax is never less than a thoroughbred musician, but it should have been more interesting than it was. He began with Debussy's early suite Pour le piano, which used to be the party-piece of many a lady pianist. Though he made it shapely and well-balanced, a party-piece was just what it failed to sound like; its 'cheap thrills' (very effectively designed by the composer) were rendered tasteful to a fault. To Ravel's Valses nobles et sentimentales Ax brought plenty of thoughtful delicacy, often a pleasure in itself; but music-box echoes - which can be charming in two or three numbers, by way of contrast - were too pervasive by far. In the advertised programme, this first half would have culminated with the Sonata of Henri Dutilleux, a fine virtuoso work that still waits in the wings of the repertoire. Excellent planning; but incomprehensibly, Ax chose to replace it with Franck's Prelude, Aria and Finale, at the best of times a worthy, musty affair. Occupying the dead centre of the programme (and 'dead' was the word), cruelly preceded by Ravel and Debussy, it sounded a damp academic squib. Musically speaking, nothing was wrong with Carnaval after the interval. Ax dealt out Schumann's mischievous hand of cards with careful tenderness. Without the least sense of mischief, however - eg in 'Harlequin', and 'Reconnaissance'; nor was there any cajoling brilliance in Ax's 'Papillons' or 'Paganini', nor did his expert Finale ever risk going into a reckless whirl. Exciting performances of Carnaval, and even memorable ones, are not so rare; this one set a tame, honest seal on a recital that ought to have been much more fun.</p>

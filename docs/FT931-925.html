			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Two quit in Korean scandal A CORRUPTION scandal in the South Korean parliament claimed its first victims yesterday as two MPs from the ruling Democratic Liberal party (DLP) resigned. At least 15 other MPs, including the speaker of the National Assembly, may be punished by the DLP for engaging in illegal property speculation and tax evasion. The actions are part of an anti-corruption campaign launched by Mr Kim Young-sam, the new president. He recently ordered DLP legislators, who hold 161 seats in the 299-member chamber, to disclose their assets. The disclosures appear to confirm public suspicions legislators have amassed arge personal fortunes from political contributions and secret financial transactions. The average wealth of ruling party MPs amounted to won Won 2.5bn (Pounds 2.2m) despite their relatively low salary. Mr Kim is using the anti-corruption campaign to assert his control over the DLP.</p>

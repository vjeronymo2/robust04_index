			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Yanora Grigorova commentary: "It Is Our Own Fault If We </F> Are Making Fools of Ourselves"]    [Text] A few days ago a Greek daily reported that in his  recent letter to Turkey's Demirel President Zhelev left a door  slightly open regarding our noninterference in Bosnia. The  Greek daily claimed that the pressure exerted by U.S. Ambassador  Montgomery was the reason for Zhelev's halfhearted attitude.    The nervous reaction of the president's spokesman following  the article was counterproductive as usual. Instead of denying  the Greek daily's report, it practically confirmed it.    Ambassador Montgomery himself further complicated the  situation by bringing a whole delegation of highranking U.S.  officials to Bulgaria immediately after the denial. Even an  acknowledged member of the National Security Council was among  them. They admitted discussing the Balkan situation with  Bulgarian political forces. People from the Bulgarian Socialist  Party [BSP] somewhat self-consciously admitted that they had  supported the official Bulgarian policy on the conflict in  Bosnia, the Rights and Freedoms Movement [DPS] members did not  say anything, and the Union of Democratic Forces [SDS]  representatives boasted of being the only ones who have a  consistent approach on the Balkan issue.    As a matter of fact, none of them denied KONTINENT's  information that the Americans had tested the approach of the  political forces to a more specific interpretation of the  nebulous "active neutrality" concept. The interpretation in  question would also be likely to include such things as granting  an air corridor to Turkey, placing our airports at the disposal  of NATO aircraft patrolling Bosnia, and so forth.    The current situation can be described as ludicrous not so  much because the United States is trying to exert pressure upon  us for such activities. It is their right to do so. However,  it is our right to refuse them. It is preposterous that we  should not do so.    It has long since been known that our political forces  cannot  agree even on matters as elementary as two plus two.  Nevertheless, whenever foreign emissaries are touring their  party headquarters trying to persuade them to support one state  to the detriment of another, their unfortunate Bulgarian  constituents who still live in a country situated between these  two states are entitled to hear a firmer stand than the little  jokes about "we would be glad if Mr. Montgomery interfered in  our domestic affairs."</p>

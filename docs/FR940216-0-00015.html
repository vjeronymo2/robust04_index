			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Cosco expressed concern that Standard 213 already requires too many warnings, and that another warning would compound the complexity and confusion of the labeling. That child seat manufacturer is concerned that consumers may not pay attention to or understand the warnings because there are simply too many warnings. Cosco suggested that NHTSA review the labeling required by the standard and possibly condense some of the required information. Fisher-Price also suggested that NHTSA undertake a ``complete reconsideration'' of Standard 213's labeling requirements, ``to assure that on-seat markings are not rendered ineffectual because of the excess of required information.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA agrees that a significant amount of information is required to be labeled on an infant restraint, and is willing to consider, in a future rulemaking, suggestions for ways in which the information could be edited or condensed. The agency believes that the air bag warning is needed now notwithstanding that it will be another item of information that competes for the attention of the consumer. However, the agency will review Standard 213's labeling requirements as Cosco and Fisher-Price suggested. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commenters were divided on whether the proposed wording was sufficiently clear. SafetyBeltSafe and the IIHS believed the statements were clear; however, some other commenters believed the clarity of the wording could be improved. The AAP believed that, in response to the proposed wording for convertible seats, some consumers might mistakenly turn the restraint so that the infant is forward-facing in an air bag position. AAP suggested that the warning should be clearer that an infant restraint must be used rear-facing, regardless of the presence of an air bag. To accomplish this, AAP suggested that the warning include the statement, ``When your baby's size requires that this restraint be used in a rear-facing position *&blank;*&blank;*'' as a condition precedent for the warning not to use the restraint in an air-bag equipped seating position. NHTSA agrees the wording should refer to the baby's size and has made appropriate changes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some commenters objected to certain words in the proposed warning. AAP suggested the word ``position'' should be used instead of ``mode'' in the term ``rear-facing mode,'' since the former word is more commonly recognized than the latter. Cosco said that adding ``mode'' following ``rear-facing'' is unnecessary. NHTSA has removed ``mode'' from the wording. Cosco also suggested the references to ``front seat'' or ``passenger side'' in ``passenger side air bag'' are unnecessary, since they do not add any relevant information. The agency agrees. Mr. Koziatek suggested the label should direct the consumer to ``secure'' the restraint instead of ``place'' it on the vehicle seat, to increase the likelihood that the restraint will be fastened to the seat. NHTSA declines to make the change, because ``secure'' might distract a consumer from the purpose of the air bag warning. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some comments suggested adding more text to the warning label. Mr. Koziatek recommended that the label include a statement directing the consumer to check the vehicle owner's manual for information about where the infant restraint should be placed in the vehicle. The statement is not needed on the label. Child seat labels already must refer consumers to the printed instructions for information on securing the child seat to the vehicle (S5.5.2(g)). Also, NHTSA is requiring the printed instructions for child seats to include a statement that owners of vehicles with passenger side air bags should refer to their vehicle owner's manual for child seat installation instructions. Moreover, NHTSA's September 1993 rule mandating air bags in passenger vehicles will require the sun visor on vehicles with passenger side air bags to be labeled with a statement referring the consumer to the vehicle owner's manual for information about the warning not to use a rear-facing infant restraint in a vehicle seating position equipped with an air bag. Placing the same information on the child seat would be redundant, and would further crowd the child seat label. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other suggestions were made for adding additional text to the warning label. Mr. Potter believed a statement describing the possible consequences of not following the warning is needed, such as by referring to the possibility of ``serious injury or death.'' NHTSA disagrees, since this rule already requires the use instructions to contain information on the consequences of not following the warning. SafetyBeltSafe suggested that the label should include a warning in Spanish. NHTSA is not requiring the bilingual labeling for the reasons discussed at 55 FR 48262 (denial of Mattox petition to require Spanish installation instructions, November 20, 1990). Thus, the standard requires manufacturers to supply the information in English. However, once this requirement is met, manufacturers may supply the same information in other languages, so long as the presence or location of the translation does not confuse consumers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

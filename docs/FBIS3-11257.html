"It is all false; it is untrue a guerrilla summit was held  in  Cuba," Jose Ramon Balaguer, who is in charge of international  relations of the ruling Communist Party's Politburo, told  NOTIMEX.    Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin said on Thursday in  Santa Fe de Bogota she had requested an official explanation  from Cuba in light of the "firm indications" she had of the  meeting, although President Cesar Gaviria subsequently explained  the request was being processed.    President Cesar Gaviria added Colombia's relations with Cuba  now depend on Havana's response to the petition for an  explanation on the case.    the Cuban Foreign Ministry on Thursday morning denied having  received the note mentioned by Sanin.    "We hold in high esteem our relations with Colombia, and in  no way could something of that sort have occurred," Balaguer  said regarding the alleged meeting.    The political leader said the version of the meeting  published in the Colombian daily EL TIEMPO is "an attempt to mar  relations" between the two nations, which "were being developed  earnestly and can continue to develop."    The media report on a meeting in the Cuban capital among  Colombian guerrillas was published five months after the two  nations had resumed diplomatic relations.    The media version followed the announcement made by the  Colombian Government on negotiations that will lead to the sale  of 15,000 to 20,000 barrels of petroleum to Cuba, which for  three decades has been under a U.S. trade embargo.</p>

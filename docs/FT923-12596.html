			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Committee in row over chairmanship ONE OF the committees where MPs co-operate to scrutinise government departments has had a vigorous disagreement even before starting its work - over choosing its chairman. Although the parties are agreed that the chairman of the employment committee should be a Labour MP, the Tory committee members blocked the election of Mr Ron Leighton, Labour's candidate and the committee chairman in the previous parliament, and refused to support him even as a temporary chairman. Mr Greville Janner, the senior Labour committee member, has been elected chairman for the first two committee meetings, but has made clear that he does not intend to stand for the chair after the next meeting, in October. Instead, just a couple of days after government whips had been blamed by some MPs for their role in appointing members of the departmental committees, Mr Janner appealed to the 'usual channels' of communication between government and opposition whips, to reach a consensus on the chairmanship. Mr Ian Bruce, Tory MP for Dorset South and one of two Tory members of the committee in the last parliament, said yesterday that the Tories were disappointed that Labour had not taken the opportunity of the committees' being set up to bring in some 'fresh blood'. All five Labour members have served on the committee before. During the last parliament, some Tory MPs were critical of Mr Leighton for dominating the questioning of witnesses in spite of an informal agreement to share the questioning more evenly among committee members. Mr Bruce said that although the Tories on the committee did not generally veto subjects for inquiries, Labour members had stopped a Tory proposal early this year for an inquiry into a minimum wage and into wages councils. Although a programme of work for the first month of so has been sketched out, the committee's next meeting is likely to be concerned with sorting out its own working relations. The choice of chairman is a matter for the committee members, and pressure may well be needed from some outside source for the deadlock to be broken. The home affairs committee has invited Mrs Stella Rimington, the director-general of the security service, to give evidence about MI5's responsibilities.</p>

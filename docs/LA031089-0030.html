			<p><P> March 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> O'CONNORS HOLD FAMILY REUNION WITH 'AUNT'  </P> <P> There's a new theater in Studio City -- or rather an old theater newly reborn.  It used to be called the Showplace, one of two small legit houses with the  uncommon distinction of being situated over a bowling alley (hate the play,  play the lanes).  </P> <P> There is some question as to whether this new 68-seat palace has been renamed  the Donald O'Connor Family Theatre or the Donald O'Connor Family's Theatre  (flyers in the hall had it both ways). But judging from the lineup of O'Connors  listed in the program as on stage and backstage, the second appellation may be  more accurate.  </P> <P> The new theater opened Tuesday with that venerable old chestnut, Brandon  Thomas' "Charley's Aunt." It features three O'Connors: Papa Donald (a hoot as  that impudent matron of the title -- a role he played at Chicago's Drury Lane  about 17 years ago), son D. Frederick and daughter Alicia. Papa also directed.  The house was packed. It was a party.  </P> <P> The production sets no new standards, breaks no records and wins no awards, but  it has a sweetness and lack of pretension that almost make up for the play's  creakiness, the wing-and-a-prayer sets, the in-and-out accents and the uneven  acting. It is indeed a family affair.  </P> <P> There are some stage-worthy performances: suave Jack Hagarty and blustery  Malcolm Rothman as the older gentlemen in lip-smacking pursuit of their  unlikely target (the aunt), and Richard Merson as the ubiquitous butler  Brassett. Alicia O'Connor makes a winsome Ela Delahay and Carmen Recker smartly  plays Amy Spettigue as a bubbly air-head. But the balance of the company needs  to get its act together, though it forged ahead gamely Tuesday and seemed to  have a good time.  </P> <P> No one more so than O'Connor pere, whose jaunty wit, super timing and innate  comic sense light up the stage and pick the show up whenever it stumbles  (often). Part of his directing in this production seems to include rescuing it  at regular intervals with funny personal business and comic ad-libs when lines  fail or cues aren't picked up. Those moments at Tuesday's performance often  proved more amusing than the scripted ones.  </P> <P> Future plans for this theater are vague, but Donald O'Connor himself is not  likely to be deeply involved. Other professional commitments call. What the  family does with it (namely his offspring, two more of whom are on the board of  directors along with a son-in-law) remains to be seen. It can continue to go  for family fun and games or it can turn serious. But if it chooses to compete  on the open market, it will have to develop a point of view and some real  quality control. The opportunity is there. So is the competition.  </P> <P>  At 12655 Ventura Blvd., Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m., Sundays at 7  p.m., through March 26. Tickets: $22.50; (818) 761-8448 or (213) 466-1767.  </P></p>

			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / Shake-up of airtime selling at ITV A SUBSTANTIAL shake-up in the selling of ITV advertising time will be announced today with the creation of two super-sales houses, Raymond Snoddy writes. The changes will yield the ITV companies savings on overheads and research costs. Granada and Scottish Television are combining their sales operations in a grouping which will include Grampian and Border Television. Meridian Broadcasting, the ITV company for the south of England which has been selling its own airtime since it took over from TVS on January 1, is joining forces with HTV, the company for Wales and the west, in a 50-50 joint venture. It will also represent Westcountry, Channel and the Welsh Fourth Channel. The move leaves Carlton Television, holders of the London weekday franchise, as the only one of the 15 ITV companies selling airtime on its own. The deals have been approved by the Independent Television Commission which has the power to prevent any ITV company or group of companies gaining a dominant position in advertising sales.

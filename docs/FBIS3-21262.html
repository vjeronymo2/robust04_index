In commercial reactors, the system structure, apart from the  core of the reactor itself, is based on materials technologies  developed by the traditional industrial infrastructure for  heating boilers and shipbuilding, which is sustained by steel  technology. In contrast, the materials used in the reactor core  are so-called "tailored alloys," such as zircaloy for  water-cooled reactors, and magnox for carbonic-acid-gas-cooled  reactors. These materials are advantageous for fission  maintenance from the standpoint of neutron economy, and meet  soundness and safety requirements. They were developed at a  relatively early stage, and have produced good results. These  two methods of materials development are suggestive for future  materials research. This article describes the current stage of  the category "basic technology research" among the research  activities of the Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute  (JAERI). An outline of project-related research (further  discussed in Part II (1) and (2)) will be included to indicate  its relationship to the other categories.  <H5>  1. History of Materials Research </H5>   Materials research in the early 1960s, the initial stage of  nuclear engineering in Japan, began with an evaluation of the  appropriateness of aluminum, which was used as a fuel cladding  material for the research reactor JRR-3 (the first national  reactor). This evaluation consisted primarily of property and  performance qualification testing for carbonic-acid-gas-cooled  reactors, and materials research for semi-homogeneous reactors.  Compared to other fields of nuclear research, materials research  at that time did not differ radically from materials research in  general engineering fields, which primarily involved basic  research on radiation effects and corrosion. During the latter  half of the 1960s, the examination of materials began at JAERI  along with the introduction of the light-water reactor, and the  development of the high-speed test reactor. The Japan Materials  Testing Reactor (JMTR) also began operation, and industry  finally became involved in irradiation testing for steel and in  other kinds of testing. Around this time, the research style  shifted to the so-called project base. (Research related to  high-speed reactors was soon transferred to the Power Reactor  and Nuclear Fuel Development Corporation (PNC).)    About 1970, the issue of pressure wall damage, which was  being analyzed for the Japan Power Demonstration Reactor (JPDR),  had an international impact on research on environment-promoted  cracking, such as corrosion fatigue and stress corrosion  cracking, which is closely related to structural safety.  Research on high-temperature structural materials corresponding  to the high-temperature gas-cooled reactor project began in the  latter half of the 1970s. In the 1980s, various research  projects -- including fuel cycle back-end technology -- such as  fusion reactor materials, fuel reprocessing, and waste  treatment, based on international cooperation, were added one  after another, and materials research and development finally  became systematic. Since the latter half of the 1980s, when  full-scale research on fusion reactor materials began,  activities to secure intense neutron sources in the high-energy  range -- reflecting the need for high neutron flux irradiation  beds, and high-performance post-irradiation test facilities --  have been stressed and introduced.    Meanwhile, research and development on organic materials,  such as polymers, conducted mainly at the Takasaki Radiation  Chemistry Research Establishment, played an important role in  the industrial application of irradiation by gamma rays and  electron beams. In the latter half of the 1980s, large-scale ion  accelerating facilities were constructed, and materials research  in many fields, including nonnuclear fields, began. These  efforts were aimed primarily at advanced applications for  radioactivity based on beam use.  <H3>  (1) Reliability of Nuclear System and Introduction of  Technology </H3>   As this historical account indicates, there is an urgent  need  to test the adaptability and durability of the materials  selected during the design of systems with definite concepts  during the period of technological introduction. It is important  to implement a highly efficient property analysis of a project  type. At the same time, attempts to create and to find  applications for materials beyond the framework of the existing  standards are considered premature. Therefore, the following  should be stressed first:    [1] Testing and verification of system adaptability and  durability (maintenance base).    As soon as the period of independent development arrives,  the  following is necessarily required:    [2] Creation and application of materials that exceed the  current systems in performance and functions.    While both methods [1] and [2] are aimed at "reliability  improvement," the decisive difference is that, with method [2],  the process of creating materials precedes in the material  formation stage according to a specific purpose. The situation  there is either that required performance level exceeds the  limits of the existing materials, or that the concept itself  does not exist. In order to cope with such situations, neither  project-type research to directly meet specific needs, nor basic  research to return to general principles is appropriate. It is  necessary to design a new approach from a different dimension to  allow both creativity and finality. This is a problem that is  peculiar to this age, where nuclear energy has become a reality.  The International Symposium on Advanced Nuclear Engineering  Research, which took place in spring of last year, recognized  this problem, and focused on the directions and roles of  materials science.  <H3>  (2) Correspondence to Increasingly Diverse and Advance  Requirements </H3>   When the industrial base, the resource situation, and the  nuclear properties of reactors from the light-water reactor to  the fusion reactor are considered, most of the materials they  comprise are general-purpose materials, such as steel, and these  will continue to improve in quality. Therefore, research on new  materials is not the sole objective of nuclear materials  development.    However, it is certain that thermal conditions -- such as  temperature and thermal flux (thermal gradient) -- and radiation  field conditions -- such as spectrum and the intensity of  neutrons in charge of energy conversion reactions -- will become  more rigid. This problem can be solved either by new materials,  or by a combination of materials with added features, in  designing and device technology. Selection of the two must  always be considered in research strategies.    Table I-1 is a summary of the major reactor types introduced  in Japan, focusing on durability and reliability in relation to  their operational environment. Requirements for individual  systems are varied, and newer systems have more advanced  requirements. With regard to structural materials, for instance,  research on a considerable scale is necessary to respond  properly to the various engineering issues. Therefore, an  expansion of the testing research matrix for behavior analysis  and evaluation is unavoidable when various materials, including  functional materials, and various operating conditions, such as  stationary, anomalous, and accident conditions, are considered.       ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table I-1.

This is because, in the case of specialized  materials that can be used only for nuclear technology,  requisite human and material resources may not be derived solely  through calculation. Many general-purpose materials that are  used in the nuclear field are supported by an important economic  factor. The quality and production base of these materials are  maintained by stable and enormous commercial needs. It is  necessary to realize that such an infrastructure cannot be  formed in a short time even with a large investment. Another  problem is that it is quite common in the development of  innovative systems for design concepts to change frequently.  This may contradict the process of material development, which  requires a long lead time. Material research related to advanced  system development needs to be guided by precise strategies  built on a thorough examination of such issues.  <H3>  2. Stronger Technology Base for Nuclear Development and  Materials Research (Items of Importance in Long-Term Plan for  Nuclear Development and Use in FY 1987) </H3>   Prior to implementation of the plan, four important areas  that required a stronger technology base were designated by the  Atomic Energy Commission, and survey activities by special  committees began. The following is a summary of the results of  the survey.  <H3>  (1) Creative Development of Advanced Technology  (Breakthrough) </H3>   The guideline for the long-term plan is based on the idea  that there are three research stages: conventional research and  development driven by needs, the current efforts to achieve  breakthroughs, and future development. In order to follow this  guideline, switching to so-called "seeds-leading" research and  development based on the creation of basic fields is to be  implemented.    The difference between an emphasis on basic research in  general and this stronger technology base is that the latter has  the clear mission to respond to social and economic needs in a  concrete manner through nuclear development as an energy  technology. That is to say the basic research envisaged here is  intended to bridge traditional or pure basic research, and  project research. It can be understood as research on a key  technology for broad applicability, or as research on a common  technology.    Some of the concepts examined at the planning stage were:    1) Creativity (breakthrough and the technological lead).    2) Contribution to nonnuclear fields as well (spin-off  effects).    3) Collaboration among industry, academic bodies, and the  government.    In terms of policy, it is intended to produce a core for  technological innovation based on 30 years of past experience,  with the premise that human and material resources would be  restricted.  <H5>  (2) Survey Results -- Struggle with Radiation Environment </H5>   Among the survey activities, which were conducted over a  period of about six months, was a questionnaire that was  distributed to nuclear-related organizations, national  institutes, universities, and private enterprises. Research  topics were solicited under the condition that those who made  proposals had priority for their implementation. It produced  over 150 items over a broad range. Figure I-1 indicates the  results in several categories. According to the results,  materials to be studied should not remain in conventionally  mainstream metals, and should cover a broad range of  possibilities, including organic and inorganic materials. It  suggests the consideration of technological spin-off to other  fields, long terms for implementation, and dependence on  large-scale facilities. In the section on "Form of  Implementation," there is no indication of incestuousness, while  there is the expectation of cooperation and interchange to  acquire a broad range of knowledge.       Further, the technological contents of the proposals have  been systematically classified in detail with some additional  items to consider. Figure I-2 divides research activities into  two conventional types: activities to produce materials, and  activities to apply them by studying their properties. The items  classified in the second category indicate that the overwhelming  number of proposals concern the achievement and improvement of  radiation tolerance, or the reduction of radiation. It has been  considered that solving problems related to neutrons, among  others, is the key to the next step, and to the point of  breakthrough.       It is necessary to prepare the answers to the following  questions: What properties from the standpoint of materials  science do materials with tolerance to neutron irradiation have,  and how should they be produced? What means are necessary to  determine their behavior during their actual use? How should the  results of such research and development be used for system  design as well as safety and reliability?  <H5>  3. Research Implementation and Progress </H5>   Based on these principles as set out by the government,  individual research organizations made implementation plans,  and, with approval for the organization budget, and so on, began  to execute them in 1988. The major research projects sponsored  by JAERI already had included the development of materials for  fusion and high-temperature gas-cooled reactors, and newly  undertaken basic research included some projects that partly  supported and complemented them from the standpoint of key  technologies. Figure I-3 illustrates its structure. It relates  to the projects more or less directly in terms of long-term  behavior testing and demonstration, as well as databases. The  following is an outline of its history.     <H5>  (1) Project Supporting Research </H5>   The current status of nuclear fusion, and of the  high-temperature gas-cooled reactor, is introduced in Part II  (1) and (2).    Research and development of fusion reactor materials began  in  the second half of the 1970s for structural materials, and  developed into a full-scale activity in 1983 with the  cooperation of the United States. At present, it has broadened  to include tritium breeding materials and insulation ceramics,  and has been conducted actively with the cooperation of many  nations within the framework of the IEA agreement.    Development of materials under the high-temperature  gas-cooled reactor project began in 1971, and proceeded all  other activities, such as test method development, materials  development, tolerance behavior study, tolerance testing in the  real-machine approximation environment, and database  development. The major structural materials for the  High-Temperature Test Reactor (HTTR) now under construction are  those developed in the project.  <H5>  (2) Material Tolerance Forecast and Database </H5>   Crucial to the technological base necessary to forecast and  extend the life of nuclear power plants are a quantitative  method for forecasting the tolerance of the constituent  materials, and a database to support it.    Assuring the tolerance of the constituent materials requires  not only experience, but also the ability to forecast life  expectancy and behavior built on the mechanism of materials  deterioration. Examples of the systematic development of testing  methods, equipment, and database systems are introduced in Part  III. Development of life expectancy evaluation technologies for  materials tolerance for nuclear fuel reprocessing plants, an  example in the section, can be considered one of the technology  bases for commercial plants. Development of the database, which  is particularly important as a key technology, began with the  analysis of crack propagation in pressure vessels for light  water reactors. At present, work on the JAERI Material  Performance Database (JMPD), which has made it possible to  achieve computer control and use of tolerance test data of  materials in real conditions for various new reactors, and on a  data highway system among organizations, which will lead to  general use of the former, are in progress.  <H5>  (3) Design and Development of New Materials </H5>   The performance of materials subjected to radiation is often  determined by factors that are fundamentally different from  those for materials put to more general uses. A typical example  is the radiation tolerance of ceramic materials. This is related  both to fundamental solid state properties, and to factors  related to the production process.    A material design process that raises fundamental issues  related to the atomic and molecular structures of materials, and  that uses such methods as molecular dynamics and computer  simulation, is a symbolic process for basic research on nuclear  materials. In addition, there have been efforts to create new  materials with highly controlled composites, purity, and  structures using totally different compound processes, and to  find breakthroughs and new possibilities. The current status of,  and future perspectives for such efforts are introduced in Parts  IV, V and VI.  <H3>  (4) Development of Innovative Testing Facilities and Testing  Technology </H3>   In conventional research, the use of radiation beds has been  restricted mainly to nuclear reactor neutrons, gamma rays from  radioisotopes, and electrons. Although these will remain  important in future, there are fatal restrictions in terms of  their radioactive energy, intensity, and irradiation  operability. Therefore, solutions to such problems are of  primary importance in implementing highly innovative research  projects.    With regard to neutrons, JAERI has proposed an Energy  Selective Neutron Irradiation Test Facility (ESNIT). This would  involve creating nuclear reactions using accelerated deuterons,  and liquid lithium as an energy-variable intense neutron source.  This proposal attracted international attention, and a  technological examination was conducted based on international  cooperation.    Meanwhile, various radiation, and heavy and light ion  accelerating facilities were constructed intensively. These  facilities made it possible to conduct single, double, and  triple simultaneous irradiation, which in turn facilitated  materials improvement and behavior study. The concept and  structure of such methods, as well as the current status and  prospects for research and development based on their use, are  introduced in Parts VII (1) and V.    Micro-test-piece testing technology is a development method  that is intended to overcome restrictions on the test volume  (the size of irradiation field) specific to the neutron and ion  beam irradiation experiment facilities mentioned above. This  also may be applied to general use. The results of integrated  development as a key technology, including remote control  technology, are described in Part VII (2).  <H5>  4. Perspective and Conclusion </H5>   Macroscopically speaking, most materials research and  development involve activities that belong inherently to key  technology research. However, the significance of emphasizing  key technology is due to a recognition that nuclear development,  including the role of materials in nuclear technology, is at a  turning point.    It is difficult to summarize our activities and experience  over the past five years. It is a subtlety of technological  research that slight changes of intellectual perspective  sometimes sparks a new burst of creativity, or that a relatively  small but continuous budget activates research and produces  efficient results. Fortunately, in FY 1992 the Evaluation  Committee of the Science and Technology Agency showed us a  sufficient understanding, which encouraged everyone concerned.    In the future, the formation of a material base in general  will be developed in the areas listed in Table I-2. One of the  remaining issues will be the proper revision, discontinuation,  and development of themes as research progresses. At the same  time, it is necessary to implement technology transfer to  projects reflecting this principle. This involves nurturing the  seeds of creativity, and maintaining an active network of  research organizations. Struggling with such a dilemma is the  fate of pioneer research, which must be implemented with limited  resources, including human resources, and which must display a  high level of intuition and efficiency.       -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table I-2.

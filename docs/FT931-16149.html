			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Winning at patience It would have been too much to expect the Bundesbank to cut its official rates at yesterday's council meeting. Still, its 15 basis point cut in the money market repurchase rate provides food for thought. Although the domestic economic background is one of unremitting gloom, the Bundesbank is not yet particularly alarmed. It would prefer to delay official rate cuts until money growth, the budget and wages are under better control. One must assume the main impulse for the move came from the foreign exchange market. If this is the case, perhaps the market should take it seriously. The negative interpretation is that this was the least the Bundesbank could do after France raised short-term money rates by a full 2 points earlier in the week. The Bundesbank has tried similar tricks before only to disappoint later. It still has the awkward task of imposing monetary discipline at home while living up to its ERM responsibilities. Doubtless it would be less inclined to accommodate if D-Mark weakness against the dollar threatened more inflation. Yet even the most hawkish Bundesbanker would have to admit that the economic situation is likely to require official rate cuts soon, probably indeed before the French elections in March. By paving the ground now, the central bank is not only indicating that the fate of the franc really does matter. It is building anticipation of more cuts to come. On both scores, the wisdom of speculating against the franc has become more questionable. There are hurdles to come. Ireland's position is looking increasingly difficult, and might leave the franc exposed. But assuming the Bundesbank follows through, the balance of probability has swung in favour of France holding its ERM parity intact.</p>

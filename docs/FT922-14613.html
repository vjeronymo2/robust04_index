			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / Election 92: Colours pinned to Sunday mastheads BRITAIN'S Sunday news-papers have voted. Five favour the Tories, three Labour and one, the Independent on Sunday, has declined to give a clear opinion. From the Murdoch stable, the News of the World says that Mr Major is 'the better bet for safeguarding our economy'. Its stablemate, The Sunday Times, backed Mr Michael Heseltine for party leader and has roundly cursed the quality of Mr John Major's campaign. The editor, Mr Andrew Neil, returns to this in a signed article. But its editorial says Labour would probably bring economic crisis by Christmas and offers 'wholehearted' endorsement for the Tories. No doubts at the Sunday Express. Headed 'Vote Tory with pride', its leader invites readers to consider 'the video recorder and the car . . . the range of foods in the fridge . . . for the vast majority of our people life has never been better'. The Sunday Telegraph, with senior writers divided between Thatcher loyalism and tactical retreat, says 'it would not be a catastrophe if Labour won on Thursday', but warns of Labour's taste for Brussels bureaucracy, devolution and constitutional reform. It hopes that the Tories' 'noble hopes' do not perish. The Mail on Sunday has long admired Dr David Owen, who returns the compliment by setting out his advice in its pages. Along with Dr Owen, the paper likes the down-to-earth Mr Major - his mounting of the soapbox is considered 'a seminal moment'. The editorial proclaims: 'give Major his chance to be great'. The Mirror group tabloids are Labour by profession. The Sunday Mirror focuses its arguments on improving the condition of women, but The People prefers a 1945 Daily Mirror slogan, declaring 'vote for them]' - that is 'all who have been disadvantaged by 13 years of appalling Tory rule'. Labour, it says, is waging 'a war against the money-grabbing, me-first mentality'. For The Observer, Labour brings the risk of public-sector pay inflation, less innovation in the public services and a tax plan which will not 'help the country out of recession'. But the Conservatives are to blame for 'a coarsening of the texture of British life' and a 'demoralisation and physical squalor' that no civilised society should tolerate. Labour, preferable on Europe and constitutional reform, is, it concludes, 'worth taking a chance on'. That leaves only Mr Ian Jack, editor of the Independent on Sunday. In a signed leader, he says the Thatcher government grew 'corrupt and arrogant' and the party so blind to the Scottish question that a Conservative victory will lead to secession. For these and other reasons, Mr Jack's cross 'will not go next to the name of the Conservative candidate'.</p>

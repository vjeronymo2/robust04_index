			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Victoria Stegic] </F>   [Text] Sarajevo, April 12 (AFP) -- Russian envoy Vitaliy  Churkin and Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic reportedly  headed to the beseiged Moslem enclave of Gorazde Tuesday as Serb  forces pursued their advance on the town in defiance of NATO  warnings. Karadzic told the Bosnian Serb news agency SRNA early  Tuesday that he and Churkin were leaving for the eastern Bosnian  enclave "to see the situation on the ground." The two men had  met earlier in the Serb stronghold of Pale outside Sarajevo as  part of a bid by Churkin to renew the dialogue between Serb  forces and UNPROFOR following NATO airstrikes on Serb attackers  around Gorazde on Sunday and Monday. Karadzic accused the UN  Protection Force (UNPROFOR) of taking sides in the confict and  said the NATO attacks had "caused significant damage and caused  deaths" in the centre of Gorazde, SRNA said. "NATO bombed both  sides" in the dispute, Karadzic insisted.    Major Rob Annink, a spokesman for UNPROFOR, said meanwhile  that Serb forces had on Monday "closed up to the river Drina"  all along the southwest of the Gorazde enclave and were also  trying to push southward from the north, coming close to Bosnian  army positions. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)  quoted aid officials on the spot as saying seven Serb shells hit  Gorazde early Tuesday. Regular bursts of small arms fire could  also be heard, said UNHCR spokeswoman Lyndall Sachs. But she  said the observers in place described the situation in the town  as "relatively calm" the day after NATO warplanes carried out  their second strike in two days on advancing Serb forces.    In Sarajevo on Tuesday, UNPROFOR commanders defended the  NATO  airstrikes as a legitimate support of the UN-declared "safe  haven" in Gorazde, denying Serb claims that UN forces were now  taking sides in the conflict. Lieutenant General Michael Rose,  UNPROFOR commander in Bosnia, told journalists the airstrikes  were a legitimate, limited tactical defence and it was out of  the question to see them as a political act. General Bertrand de  Lapresle, commander of all UN forces in former Yugoslavia, said  the air strikes should not be blown up in importance and should  not "put in question the well advanced peace process,"  interrupted by the Gorazde offensive. "We hope to be able to  restablish bridges and resume political negotiations, which  alone make sense," he added.    A total 156 people have died and 646 been wounded in Gorazde  since the Serb offensive began two weeks ago, UNHCR spokeswoman  Sylvana Foa said Tuesday at the organisation's headquarters in  Geneva. The total did not include the victims of Monday's  fighting as the Gorazde hospital could not be reached, she  added. Food was running out, with only 50 tonnes of supplies  left in storage, since fighting has prevented fresh aid  deliveries since March 22, she said.    In another report, SRNA charged that Monday's raid by NATO  planes had hit a clinic near Gorazde, killing two Serb male  nurses. Serb military sources quoted by the Belgrade-based  agency TANJUG said the first raid on Sunday by two American  F-16s only hit a civilian car.    Washington said Sunday's raid hit a Serb command post near  Gorazde and Monday an F-18 bomber destroyed an attack tank and  two military transport vehicles on the southern edge of town.  Major Roy Thomas, the senior military observer in Sarajevo, said  UNPROFOR was trying via the Bosnian Serb army to gain contact  with a Dutch military observer and his Serb interpreter who have  been missing since they left the mainly Moslem encalve of Zepa,  northeast of Gorazde, Monday morning. The observer was on a  routine administrative patrol, Thomas said. He and his  interpreter passed through a Serb checkpoint out of Zepa and  were last heard of at 9:30 a.m. (0730 GMT) Monday.    In Belgrade, a UNPROFOR spokesman said several UN vehicles  had been damaged by vandals overnight, but he said it was not  possible to link the attacks to Serbian anger over the NATO air  raids.</p>

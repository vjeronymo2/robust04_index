The two men signed a trade and economic agreement on the aid  Uzbekistan will provide its neighbor. According to Karimov, the  document "will jettison the short-term aid satisfying only  immediate needs and will tap the economic reserves available in  Tajikistan."    To help Tajikistan with the spring sowing Uzbekistan will  send fuel, agricultural machinery, fertilizers and seeds. The  trade between the two countries will be worth $140 Mn [million]  in 1994.    Rakhmonov said that Tajikistan's border with Afghanistan had  been violated over 25 times since January 1. He recalled that  the Tajik-Afghan border was part of the CIS common border that  had to be jointly protected.    Karimov said that Tajikistan could not join the agreement  between Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan on the setting up  of a common economic space before the Afghan-Tajik border was  calm.    He denied that his country was aiding Abdurashit Dustum, an  Afghan general. In his words, regional UN officials who checked  the rumors to this effect did not find any evidence of  Uzbekistan's aid to Dustum.    In Karimov's view, Afghanistan's President Rabbani was  behind  these rumors which were spread to make an impression that he had  to fight a strong opposition. "Dustum is an ethnic Uzbek. There  are 2.5 Mn Uzbeks living in North Afghanistan. This is the  reason why such questions are asked that cast a shadow on  Uzbekistan," the Uzbek president said.    Uzbekistan aided Afghanistan only with "energy which is  supplied to Mazar-e Sharif through existing networks."  Switching the supply off would harm Afghanistan's civilian  population, something that Uzbekistan cannot afford.</p>

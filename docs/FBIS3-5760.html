An official at the Seoul's Chondo-kyo headquarters said that  at the Beijing meeting, the two sides decided to adopt a joint  statement at the Seoul ceremonies and to discuss procedural  matters at Panmunjom on North Koreans' coming to Seoul.    He said, however, that it is not certain if North Koreans  could attend the Seoul ceremonies because the Seoul government  plans to allow the two sides' Panmunjom contacts to discuss  procedural matters only when the exchange of special envoys is  realized.    The Beijing contact was attended by Pang Chin-kyo,  Chondo-kyo  chairman, and Hong Chang-hwa, an official of Chondo-kyo College,  from Seoul, and Yu Yong-mi, chairman of the North Korean  Chondo-kyo Central Committee.    Materialization of North Korean delegates' visit to Seoul  would depend on the outcome of the South-North contact slated  for coming Saturday [12 March] at Panmunjom on the issue of  exchanging special envoys, the official said.</p>

NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on the same subject:    "The first round of struggle in the State Duma has ended. In  a relatively peaceful way. The Duma has got down to work. What  the results will be, good or bad, will be shown by the first  laws which the Duma will pass."    SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA carries an article by Gennadiy Zyuganov,  chairman of the Russian Communist Party group in the State Duma.    Zyuganov writes as follows:    "To develop a legislative basis is undoubtedly an essential  thing to do. But it is clear to any unprejudiced observer that  the country's present-day problems lie on a somewhat different  plane.    "We suffer from a deficit of legality, not a deficit of  laws.  None of the existing laws is being properly enacted and, what is  most dangerous, an example in this respect is being set by top  executive structures with the president at the head...    "The question is as follows: either legality is restored, or  the country would plunge deeper and deeper into the quagmire of  an economic catastrophe and a slugglishly proceeding civil war  which threatens to develop into a full-scale one at any moment".    IZVESTIYA on economic problems:    "Since the position of Finance Minister Boris Fedorov has  not  yet been decided upon, it is unclear which matters of  relationships with international financial organisations will be  tackled by which ministry".    New Economics Minister Aleksandr Shokhin, "judging by his  remarks, is ready for a certain compromise. At the same time he  said the Economics Ministry should be in control of the entire  economic situation, including foreign economic relations".    IZVESTIYA, in another article on economic issues, points out  that Central Bank chief Viktor Gerashchenko "is really convinced  that monetary injections and the restoration of old economic  contacts would boost production and make it possible to move on  to a market economy smoothly by state regulation methods."    "'Smoothly' and 'state regulation' are exceptionally  important from the personal point of view as well. Mr  Gerashchenko has already staked out a claim for the job of a  chairman of the interstate bank of CIS countries.    "If the monetary system of Russia is combined, to begin  with,  with those of Belarus and Tajikistan. And the 'wrong' done to  Messr Nazarbayev and Karimov is then 'redressed', it will turn  out that Gerashchenko would again emerge as the head of an  almost gosbank of the Soviet Union. If this office is approved  by the parliaments of 5-7 countries, no Russian reformers would  be able to topple the head of such an institution. This will be  like the chief justice of the Supreme Court in America who is  elected for life."    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA runs an exclusive interview with  President Mintimer Shaymiyev of Tatarstan after his January 21  meeting with Russian President Boris Yeltsin.    "We consider that Tatarstan should be represented in the  federal parliament. But, in order to secure that the population  of the republic show activism, it is essential to sign a  bilateral treaty. It is simply naive to expect the electorate to  be active without determining a relationship formula", Shaymiyev  said.    KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (RED STAR) on service in the Russian Army  under contract:    "Of course, a service under contract is to a large extent a  solution to the problem of manning the Army and Navy. There are  already 120,000 servicemen who have been enlisted under contract  but this accounts for only 10 per cent of the needed strength."    KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA carries an interview with prominent  political figure Valentin Falin, the author of a book entitled  "Political Reminiscences" which became a bestseller in Germany.    In the book, Falin analyses the events which preceded the  reunification of Germany.    "A contemplating attitude is not for great powers. When  German reunificaiton was knocking at the door, it was not enough  to appeal to a future verdict of history", Falin emphasises.    ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA on a presidential decree and a State Duma  draft resolution on an amnesty.    Leading experts from the Russian Interior Ministry's  research  institute, in comment on the decree and the State Duma draft  resolution, explain that the issue of the presidential decree  and the publication of a draft resolution on an amnesty do not  at all mean that an amnesty has already been decided upon. Only  a decree about bringing the draft resolution up for  consideration by the deputies enters into force.    The Duma has the right to and is certain to introduce  considerable changes to the document.    On the whole, the experts maintain, the draft resolution  which is being suggested for discussion does not basically  differ in any way from those which had been repeatedly passed  before.    The draft resolution has been drawn up competently from the  legal point of view and can in no way make for an increased  tension in society. The main positive aspect of it is that the  suggested amnesty would not apply to habitual criminals but  would concern only those convicted for offences which do not  pose grave danger to society.    IZVESTIYA on Lithuanian-Polish relations:    "Over the past two an a half years, there has been no  serious  rapprochement in the slightest degree between the two  neighbouring countries whose cultures, traditions and religion  are very similar... Fear of Polish expansion compels the  Lithuanian authorities to tackle problems concerning ethnic  Poles by methods which are far from being democratic."</p>

			<p><P> February 28, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HIJACK SUSPECT IDENTIFIED AT TRIAL BY WITNESSES, TAPE  </P> <P> As part of the case on which the United States is modeling its counterterrorism  policy, prosecutors presented eyewitness identifications and a dramatic  videotape Monday to show there was little doubt that Fawaz Younis of Lebanon  helped hijack Royal Jordanian Flight 402 on June 11, 1985.  </P> <P> In news tapes of the 30-hour hijacking's final stop in Beirut, Younis, a  Lebanese Shiite, emerges from the plane and reads his militia's demands that  all Palestinians be forced to leave Lebanon. After the passengers and crew  disembark, the plane is blown up.  </P> <P> Two witnesses -- a father and his then-teen-age son who were the only Americans  aboard the jet -- also identified Younis as the hijacker who called himself  "Nazeeh" and who led the heavily armed five-man hijacking team.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Prosecutor Raises Questions  </P> <P> But the testimony of Landry T. Slade, formerly an American University of Beirut  professor, was challenged by Francis D. Carter, Younis' court-appointed  counsel, who outlined the defense of his client and raised questions about the  soundness of the prosecution case.  </P> <P> Besides being a model for American counterterrorism policy, the case also is  considered a test for 1984 and 1986 statutes allowing the United States  "long-arm" jurisdiction in terrorism incidents involving American hostages or  aircraft overseas. Younis was arrested in an elaborate operation by U.S.  authorities in September, 1987, aboard a luxury yacht in international waters  off Cyprus. Younis, who looked almost preppy in a gray V-neck sweater and  green-and-navy striped tie, faces six charges of air piracy and hostage-taking  that could bring him a life sentence. His involvement in the incident is little  disputed, as the tapes played by federal prosecutor Karen Morissette showed.  </P> <P> But in an attempt to show that Younis' rights were violated, Carter noted that  Slade originally identified a man who had nothing to do with the hijacking from  a selection of FBI photos -- and missed Younis' picture altogether -- when  first interviewed two years after the incident. Only after the FBI agent  identified Younis' picture was Slade able to point him out, Carter said. Younis  spent most of the time in the cockpit, out of view of the passengers.  </P> <P> Carter hopes to prove that, in its zeal to capture its first international  terrorist, the United States exceeded legal boundaries.  </P> <P> In his opening statement, Carter also noted that Younis was interrogated aboard  a U.S. ship in the Mediterranean while suffering acute seasickness and two  broken wrists, for which he was given only a bag of ice.  </P> <P> Younis' wrists did not receive full medical attention for four days, until  after he had signed a full confession. "You will have to determine whether the  statement that my client gave was voluntary or involuntary," Carter told jurors  in his opening statement. A federal appeals court earlier overturned a lower  court decision throwing out the confession.  </P> <P> Carter also questioned whether Younis, as a lower-ranking member of Lebanon's  Shiite Amal militia, can be held responsible for an act ordered by his  superiors.  </P> <P> A third point of defense is that the hijackers never intended to harm the  Americans. Slade testified that he saw two hijackers point to the Slades as the  two Americans on board. They then told him: "Don't worry," he said.  </P> <P> Although no one was killed in the incident and none of the passengers were  hurt, six Jordanian sky marshals were badly abused.  </P> <P> The prosecution spent much of the first day asking Slade and his son, William,  about the beatings.  </P> <P> In cross-examination, Carter established that Younis was not among those who  beat the marshals. Slade conceded that Younis came out of the cockpit and  ordered an end to the brutality.  </P></p>

			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Technology (Worth Watching): Breaking the copyright laws 'Innocent' computer users, unaware of copyright laws, are the greatest cause of software piracy in the UK, according to a report from the Federation Against Software Theft. Fifty-nine per cent of all inquiries carried out by Fast in 1992 related to companies that were unaware of the law. A further 21 per cent involved IT managers who were aware of the law but attempted to cut costs by deliberately copying software. Fast: UK, 0628 660377.</p>

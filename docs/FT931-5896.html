			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Balance of payments worsens ITALY'S overall balance of payments in January registered a deficit of L765bn (Pounds 349m), compared with a L566bn deficit during the same period in 1992, writes Robert Graham. The deficit reflected movement in the current account which was in the red to the tune of L5,169bn. In contrast, capital movements registered a surplus of L4,603bn. This was largely due to an upsurge of foreign investment totalling L6,163bn. Portfolio investment accounted for L5,497bn, compared with a mere L47bn in January 1992. These inflows were only partially offset by L2,736bn of Italian capital going abroad. Significantly the latter outflows were down on the same period in 1992 when they totalled L7,535bn. The country's foreign currency reserves stood at L37,966bn at the end of January, compared with last September's low of L20,801bn during the currency crisis.</p>

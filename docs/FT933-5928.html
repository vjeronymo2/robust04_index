			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / Privatised prison plans attacked GOVERNMENT plans to extend the role of the private sector in the UK prison service were yesterday attacked by the opposition, prison officers and penal reform groups. Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, will announce a 'strategy for future private-sector involvement' tomorrow, barely a week after publication of a critical report on the first privatised prison. Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary, said that the Labour party would resist further privatisation of prisons until there had been a proper assessment of privatisations which had already taken place. Mr Robert Maclennan, Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, said that it was not yet clear that privately run prisons offered a genuine improvement in the service. Only two of the UK's 130 prisons have so far been privatised - Wolds remand prison on Humberside and Blakenhurst in Hereford and Worcester. The contract to run Strangeways prison in Manchester was put out to tender but the contract was won by the in-house team. Judge Stephen Tumim, the chief inspector of prisons, said last week that it was impossible to determine the value for money of the privatisation arrangements for the Wolds prison. He blamed weaknesses in the management agreement and an absence of systems for checking financial aspects of the contract. Judge Tumim also attacked the 'lethargy' among the prison's inmates, who were not encouraged to make good use of their time. These comments follow controversy over recently leaked Home Office documents which suggested that Mr Howard thought prisons were not 'austere' enough. The Prison Officers' Association promised fierce opposition to any further privatisation plans. Mr John Bartell, its chairman, said members would be balloted on industrial action if more prisons were to be privatised. Mr Adam Sampson of the Prison Reform Trust said that privatising existing jails would fall foul of the European Community directive that protects the jobs and conditions of staff whose work is contracted out. However, Group 4, the private security company that manages Wolds, said it would be happy to bid for existing prisons.</p>

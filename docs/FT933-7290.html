			<p>930823 FT  23 AUG 93 / Tory MPs back 65 as harmonised pension age NEARLY two-thirds of Tory MPs believe the state retirement pension age should be harmonised for men and women at 65, a survey published today says. The Access Opinion survey of its cross - party panel of 100 MPs found a significant swing in favour of the move since last year. However, just 7 per cent of Labour MPs agreed with their Tory colleagues. A third of Labour MPs wanted harmonisation at 63 and a third said 60. The remainder either had no opinion or wanted the present differential to remain. The Confederation of British Industry recently urged the government to raise women's retirement age to 65. It said: 'The present indecision is causing real concern in the business community. It is time they made up their minds. 'A decision needs to be announced soon with a lengthy phasing-in so that the position of women currently planning to retire at 60 is fully protected.' A white paper on pensions policy has already been delayed and is now expected later this year. The National Association of Pension Funds has urged the government to make a speedy decision.</p>

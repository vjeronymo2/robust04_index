			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / World Commodities Prices: Wool Prices strengthened again this week. Most increases were small but finer merinos rose more sharply in price, as did merino cardings. Both categories have been selling well from the Australian stockpile recently, and finer merino fleece supplies are expected to remain under pressure this season. Crossbred wool also met with good demand at auctions in Australia and New Zealand this week, with China buying actively. The current trade view is that China could need supplies for urgent shipment and is lightly stocked. Strength in the Australian dollar has helped to push up calculations of imported wool costs. This does not apply to wool sold by the British Wool Marketing Board but prices have tended higher in this sector also, in anticipation of a dearer auction next week. The spices report was not available for this edition.</p>

			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Ofgas chief eases hard line on energy efficiency plans A ray of hope for the govern-ment's energy efficiency plans was offered yesterday by Ms Clare Spottiswoode, Britain's gas regulator, who extended an olive branch to her predecessor as director-general of Ofgas. Quizzed for the second time by the House of Commons environment committee, Ms Spottiswoode qualified her earlier opposition to passing the costs of energy efficiency projects on to gas customers. Referring to her controversial testimony earlier this year, Ms Spottiswoode said: 'I withdraw unreservedly any implication that my predecessor (Sir James McKinnon) acted illegally.' Sir James yesterday told the committee he had not acted outside his powers, as previously suggested by Ms Spottiswoode. He said an energy efficiency levy added to gas bills would not fall disproportionately on poorer households. MPs on the committee, however, described Ms Spottiswoode's comments as a 'grudging retraction'. They said they were still concerned for the future of energy efficiency plans. Mr Robert Ainsworth, Labour MP for Coventry North East, said: 'She has been forced to move her position by the fact that the excuses she gave didn't hold water.' But he added: 'I don't believe her basic principles have changed - she will find ways of minimising Ofgas's role (in funding energy efficiency) That was her attitude.' The row, which has grown since Ms Spottiswoode's appointment in November, centres on the financing of the Energy Saving Trust, one of the main planks of the government's environmental strategy. The trust is intended to subsidise household improvements which save energy, passing on the costs through gas and electricity bills. Ms Spottiswoode has argued that it was outside the regulator's powers to levy, in effect, a tax. Yesterday, however, she said she now accepted that such a levy did not constitute a tax. She said she would reserve her discretion on approving projects in the light of their impact on bills and whether schemes were 'the most cost-effective way of achieving the objectives'. Mr Eoin Lees, chief executive of the trust, said he was 'encouraged' that Ms Spottiswoode might approve some projects. Regulator feels pressure, Page 10</p>

			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): In defence of the neem tree THE neem tree, a native of India and Burma and a cousin to the mahogany, could provide third world countries with products from pesticides to contraceptives, as well as providing the means to reforestation in the tropics. According to a report from the National Research Council in Washington, the drought-tolerant tree has internal chemical defences which protect it from leaf-chewing insects - about 200 species as well as mites, fungi and bacteria. But it is non-toxic to humans and other animals. Combined with its antiseptic and antifungal activities, this makes the neem tree ideal for products such as pesticides as well as toothbrushes, soap and oils, says the report, Neem: A Tree for Solving Global Problems. Because the oil of the neem is a strong spermicide, it could also be used in contraceptives. National Research Council: US, 202 334 2000.</p>

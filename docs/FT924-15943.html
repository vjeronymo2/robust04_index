			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / International Company News: JP Morgan boycotts O&amp;Y meeting JP MORGAN, the New York banking group, boycotted a creditors' meeting called by Olympia &amp; York yesterday in protest against what the bank views as totally inadequate proposals for restructuring the troubled property developer's US debt. Morgan's unhappiness with O&amp;Y's proposals is balanced, however, by its willingness to put off for at least another month plans to seize an interest-rate swap pledged as partial collateral on a USDollars 160m loan to O&amp;Y. The restructuring plan is designed to keep O&amp;Y's US operations out of the bankruptcy protection sought last May for the parent company and its Canadian subsidiaries, and for the Canary Wharf project in London. O&amp;Y asked about 75 creditors who did attend the meeting in New York to defer principal payments for about five years. It hopes to reach a comprehensive agreement by the end of this year for a 'consensual long-term restructuring' of the US debt. Banking sources said that Morgan views the proposals as a 'complete non-starter'. Morgan is the co-lead manager of the syndicate which advanced the Dollars 160m loan. It has moved on several fronts in recent months to secure its interests, including a threat to auction the swap and a demand that it have greater control over the cash flow of several buildings also pledged as security for the loan. A JP Morgan spokesman said yesterday that 'constructive talks' were continuing with O&amp;Y on the swap. The deadline for seizure has been extended until October 29, at the earliest. O&amp;Y's US subsidiary said its restructuring plan would enable it to maintain its franchise as an owner and manager of properties concentrated in New York City.</p>

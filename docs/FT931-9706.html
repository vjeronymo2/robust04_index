			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / Australia hears of 1m reasons not to vote Labor: Keating's hawkish campaign takes a knock from latest unemployment figures WHEN Australians were told by the official statistics bureau yesterday that more than a million of them were unemployed last month, prime minister Paul Keating found it difficult to sustain the hawkish tone with which he launched his election campaign this week. Seasonally adjusted, the January unemployment rate actually fell to 10.9 per cent from December's 11.3 per cent. It was also the first time it had fallen below 11 per cent since September last year. However, the shock figure of 1,001,800 blurred the vaguely rosy picture. And it was certainly no plus for Mr Keating in a campaign being run on economic management and employment issues. It was the highest figure since the great depression of the 1930s, and its bitter aftertaste will linger throughout 1993, when the jobless rate is widely expected to stay in double digits. The jobs figure started the rollercoaster trail of the ruling Labor party's election campaign. At kick-off on Monday the party rode high on a favourable response to the business incentive package launched by Mr Keating. The vote-buying package would have helped to steal some votes from small and medium businesses who have previously supported the policies of the conservative Liberal-National coalition. He has dangled a substantial tax cut for companies: from 39 per cent to 33 per cent. He also offered a one-off 10 per cent investment allowance for businesses buying plant and equipment. The package would also have locked in some swinging voters among the middle-class baby boomers. It promised a 30 per cent cash rebate for work-related child care plus 150,000 new child-care places. But the lustre of the package is slowly fading as the costs it would involve emerge. Overall government spending will rise by ADollars 2.2bn (Pounds 980m) over three years, further worsening the budget deficit. Already Mr Keating has acknowledged that the 1992-93 budget deficit will reach ADollars 15.9bn, up from the original estimate of ADollars 13.4bn. Gross domestic product growth expectations for 1992-93 have also been cut from 3 per cent to 2.5 per cent. The business community has also pointedly claimed that Mr Keating's package missed the important issue of industrial relations. The leading employer groups, the Business Council of Australia, and the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, both said investment stimulation would require not only tax cuts but quick changes to the country's labour relations system. From the start Labor was on the defensive. When Mr Keating called the surprisingly early election for March 13, the party was still licking its wounds from its defeat in the state election in Western Australia. At the same time the party was embarrassed when a high-ranking federal parliamentary official, who is also a close 'mate' of Mr Keating, resigned over a controversial ADollars 65,000 accident compensation payment. However, Mr Keating is well known for his uncanny ability to turn political adversity into advantage at the most unexpected moment. The conservative opposition coalition needs only six more seats to win power in its own right, five if the lone sitting independent MP is re-elected. At the moment the 147 seats are divided among Labor (77), conservatives (68), one independent and one vacant but previously occupied by an independent. Five days into the five-week campaign, the conservatives are hammering the theme '10 years of economic hardship under Labor is enough'. Now they say there are a million reasons not to vote Labor. But the conservative leader, Mr John Hewson, has yet to match Mr Keating's policy promises. Mr Hewson has already said he would not match such an 'unfunded' package which left a gaping hole in the budget. The conservatives are proposing a goods and services tax and cuts to business taxes, such as payroll, wholesale and fuel taxes. Introduced early last year, they have been well received by business. Even more welcomed is Mr Hewson's industrial relations package, which would reduce union power by allowing employers and employees to negotiate directly over working conditions. In an attempt to recover some of the working-class vote, Mr Hewson late last year sweetened his proposals by exempting food from the goods and services tax. He is expected to offer more sweeteners soon. Campaign scores may change dramatically after an American-style television debate between the two leaders on Sunday. Mr Keating can be expected to unleash the power of his parliamentary debating skills. A big advantage for Labor is the voters' natural fear of change. In Western Australia's state election last week a discredited Labor state government, widely expected to be humbled, was dealt a muted blow by an electorate uncertain about the conservatives' radical industrial relations and tax policies.</p>

Nerve conduction studies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Nerve conduction studies are generally performed on peripheral nerves and can be useful in investigations of possible peripheral neuropathy. Most peripheral nerves contain mixtures of both individual sensory and motor nerve fibers, which may or may not be differentially sensitive to neurotoxicants. It is possible to distinguish sensory from motor effects in peripheral nerve studies by measuring activity in purely sensory nerves such as the sural to study sensory effects or by measuring the muscle response evoked by nerve stimulation to measure motor effects. While a number of endpoints can be recorded, the most commonly used variables are (1) Nerve conduction velocity, and (2) response amplitude. In well-controlled studies, decreases in nerve conduction velocity typically are evidence of neurotoxicity (Dyer, 1987). While a decrease in nerve conduction velocity is a reliable measure of demyelination, it frequently occurs rather late in the course of axonal degradation because normal conduction velocity may be maintained for some time in the face of axonal degeneration. For this reason, a measurement of normal nerve conduction velocity does not necessarily rule out peripheral axonal degeneration if other signs of peripheral nerve dysfunction are present. Increases in conduction velocity of adult organisms following treatment with neurotoxic compounds, in the absence of hypothermia, are atypical responses and may, in fact, reflect experimental or statistical errors. Decreases in response amplitude reflect a loss of active nerve fibers, and may occur prior to decreases in conduction velocity in the course of peripheral neuropathy. Hence changes in response amplitude may be more sensitive measurements of axonal degeneration than conduction velocity. Measurements of response amplitude, however, are more variable and require careful experimental techniques, a larger sample size, and greater statistical power than measurements of velocity to detect changes. Alterations in peripheral nerve function are associated with abnormal peripheral sensations such as numbness, tingling, or burning or with motor impairments such as weakness. Examples of compounds that alter peripheral nerve function in humans or experimental animals at some level of exposure include acrylamide, carbon disulfide, hexacarbons, lead, and some organophosphates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 --> 4.3.3.2. Sensory evoked potentials.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Sensory evoked potentials are electrophysiological procedures that involve measuring the response elicited by the presentation of a defined sensory stimulus such as a tone, a light, or a brief electrical pulse to the skin. Sensory evoked potentials reflect sensory function, and can be used to investigate visual, auditory, or somatosensory (body sensation) systems (Rebert, 1983; Mattsson and Albee, 1988). The data are in the form of a voltage record over time, which can be quantified in several ways. Commonly, the positive and negative voltage peaks are identified and measured as to their latency (time from stimulus onset) and amplitude (voltage).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Changes in peak amplitudes or equivalent measures reflect changes in the magnitude of the neural population that is responsive to stimulation. Both increases and decreases in amplitude are possible following exposure to neurotoxicants because (1) The brain normally operates in a careful balance between excitatory and inhibitory systems, and disruption of this balance can produce either positive or negative shifts in the voltages recorded in evoked potential experiments, and (2) excitatory or inhibitory neural activity is translated into a positive or negative deflection in the sensory evoked potential depending on the physical orientation of the electrode with respect to the tissue generating the response, which is frequently unknown. Within any given sensory system, the neural circuits that generate the different evoked potential peaks differ as a function of peak latency. In general, early latency peaks reflect the transmission of afferent sensory information, and changes in either the latency or amplitude of these peaks generally indicate a neurotoxic change that is likely to be reflected in deficits in sensory perception. The later latency peaks, in general, reflect not only the sensory input, but also the more nonspecific factors such as the behavioral state of the subject including such factors as arousal level, habituation, or sensitization. Thus, the neurotoxicological significance of changes in later latency evoked potential peaks must be interpreted in light of the behavioral status of the subject.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 --> 4.3.3.3. Convulsions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Observable behavioral convulsions in animals may be indicative of central nervous system seizure activity. However, behavioral convulsions that occur only at lethal or near lethal dose levels may reflect an indirect effect secondary to systemic toxicity and not directly on the nervous system. Convulsions occurring at dose levels that are clearly sublethal, and in the absence of apparent systemic toxicity, are more likely due to a direct effect on the nervous system. In such cases, neurophysiological recordings of electrical activity in the brain that are indicative of seizures may provide additional evidence of direct neurotoxicity. In addition to producing seizures, chemicals may also affect seizure susceptibility, altering the frequency, severity, duration, or threshold for eliciting seizures produced through other means. Such changes can occur after acute exposure or after repeated exposure to dose levels below the acute threshold, and are considered neurotoxic. Agents that produce convulsions include lindane, DDT, pyrethroids, and trimethyltin (WHO, 1986). Some agents, including many solvents, act to raise the threshold for eliciting seizures through other means or otherwise act to reduce the severity or duration of the elicited convulsions. These agents are difficult to classify as neurotoxic based on such data, but frequently have other effects on which a determination of neurotoxic potential can be based.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 --> 4.3.3.4. Electroencephalography (EEG)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> EEG analysis is used widely in clinical settings for the diagnosis of neurological disorders and less often for the detection of subtle toxicant-induced dysfunction (WHO, 1986; Eccles, 1988). The basis for the use of EEG in either setting is the relationship between specific patterns of EEG waveforms and specific behavioral states. Because states of alertness and the stages of sleep are associated with distinct patterns of electrical activity in the brain, it is generally thought that arousal level can be evaluated by monitoring the EEG. Dissociation of EEG activity and behavior can, however, occur after exposure to certain chemicals. Normal patterns of transition between sleep stages or between sleeping and waking states are known to remain disturbed for prolonged periods of time following exposure to certain chemical classes (e.g., organophosphates). Changes in the pattern of the EEG can be elicited by stimuli producing arousal (e.g., lights, sounds) and neuroactive drugs. In studies with toxicants, changes in EEG pattern can sometimes precede alterations in other objective signs of neurotoxicity. EEG experiments must be done under highly controlled conditions, and the neurotoxicological significance of chemical-induced changes in the EEG in the absence of other signs of neurotoxicity must be considered on a case-by-case basis. Many chemicals, including metals, solvents, and pesticides, would be expected to affect the EEG.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> B. Fund Availability <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with the FY 1994 HUD Appropriations Act (Pub.L. 103&hyph;124, approved October 28, 1993), the Department is making available, through this NOFA, up to $119.2 million of the FY 1994 public housing development funds for MROP activities consistent with section 111 of the Housing and Community Development (HCD) Act of 1992 (Pub.L. 102&hyph;550, approved October 28, 1992). Because some of the appropriated funds are to be derived from recapture of prior year obligations, a lesser amount may be available under this NOFA, unless actual recaptures during the current Fiscal Year return the amount to the appropriated level.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the $60 million of FY 1993 public housing development funds provided in the FY 1993 HUD Appropriations Act (Pub.L. 102&hyph;389, approved October 6, 1992) for MROP activities consistent with section 111 of the HCD Act of 1992, is also being made available. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  As noted in the September 13, 1993 FY 93 MROP Activities NOFA, the FY 1993 funds are being made available for MROP activities in accordance with the Joint Statement of the Managers in Explanation of the Conference Agreement (see H.R. Rep. 103&hyph;165, pg. 31) on the Supplemental Appropriations Act of 1993 (Pub.L. 103&hyph;50, approved July 2, 1993).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Consistent with section 624 of the HCD Act of 1992, HUD has established a set-aside of five percent of the total of up to $179.2 million (which provides up to $8,950,000 depending on recaptures) for MROP Activities for housing designated for disabled families, which will be the subject of a separate NOFA to be published by the Department.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> C. Fund Assignments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Funding for MROP activities is provided for the reconstruction of existing public housing, the extent of which is not predictable by formula. Therefore, the funds provided under this NOFA will not be fair-shared. This determination was made on the basis of the exclusion of funds as incapable of geographic allocation pursuant to 24 CFR 791.403(b) published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  on August 4, 1993 (58 FR 41426).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Field Offices will ascertain threshold-approvability and, after Joint Review, send the threshold-approvable applications to a review selection panel(s) comprised of representatives from various Field Offices (hereafter referred to as ``panel(s)'').  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The panel(s) shall rate and rank the threshold-approvable applications based on the criteria in Section IV.E. of this NOFA, and provide Headquarters with a list, in rank order, reflecting the ratings. The Department, in its discretion, may choose to select or partially fund a lower-rated application in order to increase national geographic diversity, and/or to increase the diversity of development types (high-rise buildings of five or more stories and those which include only low-rise buildings).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> D. Eligibility <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Applications for public housing development_MROP activities must be submitted by PHAs eligible for development funding which have the required local cooperation and legal authority to develop, own and operate public housing projects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> PHAs eligible under the Comprehensive Improvement Assistance Program (CIAP) (CIAP-eligible PHAs) and under the Comprehensive Grant Program (CGP) (CGP-eligible PHAs) may apply for these funds. CIAP and CGP are hereinafter referred to as ``modernization.'' Applications will be determined eligible using the modernization procedures outlined in Public Housing Modernization rule 24 CFR part 968, as amended by the interim rule for Public and Indian Housing, Revised Comprehensive Improvement Assistance Program, published on March 15, 1993 (58 FR 13916), (as modified by this NOFA).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applications must meet the threshold approvability requirements in Section IV.B of this NOFA, including the following requirements which must be addressed in the PHA's Narrative Statement accompanying its application, and will be rated by a panel(s) on the Technical Review Factors listed in Section IV.E. of this NOFA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. A project proposed for MROP activities must have long-term viability after reconstruction and the annual contributions contract (ACC) for the project must remain in effect for 40 years. In determining viability, the PHA must have a comprehensive plan (funded from other sources such as CIAP, CGP, donations, etc.) for the project for which the funds for MROP activities are being requested. The comprehensive plan for the project may be part of the PHA's comprehensive plan for modernization. The comprehensive plan must demonstrate a strategy which will assure that the entire development will be viable for a minimum period of 20 years. This strategy may include, but not be limited to, an estimate of the required amount needed for rehabilitation of the remaining portion of the development to the extent any additional rehabilitation is required; sources of funding for the additional work; any proposed demolition/disposition that may be planned; and written evidence of local government and resident support for the strategy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. A proposed MROP activities project must be a rental (not homeownership) project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. An ``obsolete project or building'' is one that has design or marketability problems that have resulted in:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. Current vacancies of more than 25 percent of the units available for occupancy; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. (1) Estimated costs of the project (including any costs for lead-based paint abatement activities) that exceed 70 percent of the total current development cost limits for new construction of similar units in the area; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The project or building has:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) An occupancy density or a building height that is significantly in excess of that which prevails in the neighborhood; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) A bedroom configuration that could be altered to better serve the needs of families seeking occupancy to public housing; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Significant security problems in and around the project; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Significant physical deterioration or inefficient energy and utility systems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. The deficiencies must be determined correctable under the CGP or the CIAP procedures (see 24 CFR part 968 and related issuances), to ensure long-term viability (a useful life with full occupancy) of more than 20 years after completion of reconstruction; the ACC for the project must remain in effect for 40 years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Existing projects which consist of more than one building may have MROP activities funding in any single year limited to one or more (less than all) of a project's buildings. Where separate portions of an existing project receive MROP funding in different fiscal years, each portion must be given a separate MROP project number and the funds reserved must be sufficient to complete all of the reconstruction needed to make the portion viable; in such cases, the funds for each MROP project must be kept separate and may not be commingled.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. A combination of MROP activities and modernization funds may be used within a project, but may not be used within the same units (or buildings, as applicable). For example, if an existing project consists of low-rise, row, and elevator buildings, an MROP activities project could be approved to include all or some of the row units, with the balance of units included in a modernization project. MROP funds may, however, be used in conjunction with Urban Revitalization Demonstration funds (HOPE VI) without limitation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

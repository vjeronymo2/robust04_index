			<p>BFN     [Text] Eduard Shevardnadze, the head of state and commander  in chief of the Armed Forces, issued an edict introducing a  number of changes in the organization and structure of the  Georgian Defense Ministry.    The edict says that changes are needed due to the fact that  the special purpose, rapid reaction and "mobile" units, which  were set up in the past as part of the country's Armed Forces  and were mainly staffed with volunteers, are at present having a  negative effect on the process of creating regular units in the  Georgian national army. According to the edict, the  above-mentioned units are to be incorporated into motor rifle  brigades of the Georgian Armed Forces.    The commander in chief's edict abolishes the Military Police  Directorate on the grounds that it duplicates the duties of the  republic's law enforcement bodies and fails to meet modern  requirements.    The head of state's edict declares disbanded all military  formations and groups that are not part of the Armed Forces. It  says that their personnel and weaponry are to be used to staff  and equip motor rifle brigades.    With the aim of establishing strict military discipline and  order at Defense Ministry units, the edict orders the setting up  of commandant's offices and garrisons in all towns and  settlements where such units are based.</p>

			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / International Company News: NEC predicts pre-tax loss of Y40bn as demand slows NEC, the Japanese electronics group, revised downwards its results forecast for the year to March and expects to see a Y40bn (Dollars 344m) pre-tax loss for the group on a consolidated basis. The revision comes after NEC announced in October a pre-tax profits forecast of Y10bn. It reflects an unexpectedly depressed market for electronic products worldwide in the first three months of this year, the company said. NEC now forecasts consolidated sales of Y3,620bn, compared with a previous forecast of Y3,780bn. A pre-tax loss of Y40bn compares with a profit of Y51.4bn in the year to March 1992. For the parent company, NEC expects a 5 per cent drop in sales to Y2,900bn and a pre-tax profit of Y18bn, which represents a 77 per cent decline from the previous Y40bn. The company blamed the unexpectedly severe slowdown in domestic demand, particularly for electronic devices, for the revision of its results forecast. When NEC made its profits forecast in October, it had been expecting a customary seasonal rush of orders in the January to March period from corporations buying to use up their procurement budget. This year, however, that buying spree failed to materialise. NEC has, like many Japanese semiconductor companies, been hurt by a severely depressed market for memory chips and by weak prices, which lasted until the fourth quarter of last year. In 1992, NEC lost its position as the world's largest semiconductor manufacturer to Intel of the US, according to Dataquest the market research group. In its computer business, the company faces growing competition from US manufacturers in its home market where it has a 53 per cent market share. For the fiscal year beginning in April, however, NEC expects overall revenues to increase by 4 to 5 per cent as the Japanese government's economic stimulus package and the recovery in the US market help to lift trading activity.</p>

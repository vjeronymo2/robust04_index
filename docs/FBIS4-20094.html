			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Dieter Kindermann: "Haider: FPOe Will Carry Out </F> Anti-EU Campaign After All!"]    [Text] Vienna -- The FPOe [Freedom Party of Austria] has  turned a new pirouette in its dance on eggs regarding the  European Union [EU]: It is going to embark on an anti-EU  campaign after all. "Contrary to our original intentions,"  Joerg Haider admitted yesterday. Why are they doing it then?  "Because the chances are very favorable that we can still stop  the government taking the wrong path it is taking," Haider  stated.    At the FPOe's special congress on the EU in Villach on 9  April, 85.5 percent of the delegates voted for the double  strategy:     -  The FPOe members of parliament were urged to  reject the EU laws;    -  FPOe supporters and citizens are, however,  given a free choice in the referendum.    At yesterday's FPOe Executive Committee meeting behind  closed  doors in Bad Tatzmannsdorf it was decided to initiate an anti-EU  campaign. Haider said, "I myself will appear at large rallies  to clearly explain the FPOe's arguments for Austria and against  the EU of Maastricht."    One of the FPOe's prominent politicians, Hirnschall,  expressed disappointment: "This does not correspond to what was  decided in Villach. There was no mention of an anti-EU  campaign." Hirnschall said that the campaign is "a danger for  EU membership, because it will certainly arouse emotions and  heat up the atmosphere."</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Council of Europe/Zhirinovskiy: </F> Russia's Frontiers Are Not Fixed"]    [Text] Strasbourg, 12 Apr 94 (AGENCE EUROPE) -- The new  delegation of 18 Russian parliamentarians that enjoys special  guest status at the Parliamentary Assembly caused quite a stir  from the very opening of the sitting because of the presence of  ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovskiy who provoked several  incidents. He first of all tried to enter a room where a meeting  of the Liberal Group was being held (which had refused to let  him participate), and then let fly vindictive remarks aimed at  the French authorities because they had issued him with a  restricted visa. Mr. Vladimir Shumeyko, Deputy Chairman of the  Council of Ministers, spoke at the opening of the sitting. He  once more appealed for swift accession by Russia to the Council  of Europe, which would constitute recognition of the  "irreversible choice for democracy and human rights" made by his  country. He stressed that the organisation cannot become truly  pan-European until Russia is part of it, and that accession  would naturally lead to greater reform. This, however, is not  Mr. Zhirinovskiy's opinion. He considered the Council of Europe  should understand that the delegation sent to Strasbourg  represents the "losers" of the last elections, and that he,  alone, represented the winners. In his view, "most deputies  want neither NATO nor the Council of Europe." He said Russia was  more "advanced" than the Council of Europe: "We have overtaken  you (...) We have more rights and liberties than your Member  States," he said. He went on to say that the Council of Europe  encompasses countries like Turkey which bombs Kurd villages and  the United Kingdom that inflicts a bloodbath on Northern  Ireland, while NATO bombs the Serbs. In his opinion, NATO  should be dissolved and the Council of Europe should not speak  to Russia with the "tone of mentors" as it is the Council that  should conform to Russian norms and not the other way round.  "You should pay us for all the revolutions you have stirred up  over the past 75 years (...) and for having inoculated us with  the virus of communism," he added before going on to conclude:  "We do not yet know where Russia's frontiers are.... You will  have to accept them once we have decided."</p>

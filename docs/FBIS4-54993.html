			<p>BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, May 6 (AFP) -- A Bosnian Serb tank  disappeared from UN surveillance Friday [6 May] less than a  kilometre (half a mile) from the centre of Sarajevo while  travelling from the Serb stronghold of Pale to barracks at  Lukavica, on the capital's outskirts, a UN military source said.  The source said the tank disappeared close to Grbavica, a  downtown suburb held by the Serbs, in the exclusion zone around  Sarajevo in which the United Nations has banned heavy weapons.</p>

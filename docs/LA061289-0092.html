			<p><P> June 12, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PARKING-LOT SALE SHOOS WOLVES FROM THE STAGE DOOR  </P> <P> "I think we have survived!"  </P> <P> With those words, a jubilant but weary Patricia Terry declared that Santa Ana's  Alternative Repertory Theatre earned enough money at an emergency fund-raiser  Saturday to keep it from closing because of a financial crisis. "This puts us  back in the ballpark," said Terry, artistic director of the 2-year-old troupe.  "I think we are going to have a third season."  </P> <P> ART announced in May that poor attendance since February at its 61-seat  storefront theater had led to the crisis, and that it would be forced to  disband unless it raised $7,000 by the middle of this month.  </P> <P> Terry said the troupe netted more than $3,000 from Saturday's huge "Slaves to  ART Parking Lot Sale," which drew a steady stream of customers for everything  from used washing machines to home-baked goods and Tarot card readings.  </P> <P> The earnings -- combined with a $1,000 pledge from a Newport Beach benefactor  and recent income from improved box-office business -- have put ART close to  its stated goal. "We'll have $6,000 in the bank by Monday morning," Terry  noted.  </P> <P> The troupe, which has come to symbolize the fitful growth of grass-roots arts  groups in Orange County over the past two years, has produced seven plays since  the fall of 1987. It's current offering -- William Hanley's "Slow Dance on the  Killing Ground" -- is scheduled to close Saturday.  </P> <P> Buoyed by the latest turn of events, Terry said the troupe "will absolutely"  seek nonprofit status to make fund-raising more practical. And it will pursue  more sharply defined marketing plans on the advice of a professional  fund-raiser who has "talked us through new strategies."  </P> <P> One strategy already decided upon is another yard sale -- with donated items  left over from the parking-lot sale -- to be held Saturday at 2312 Santa Ana  Ave.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, ART has pencilled in a new season, though it hasn't yet decided on  all the titles. A classical Greek play will lead off (Sept. 29-Nov. 18),  possibly "Lysistrata" or "Medea." A contemporary piece will follow (Jan. 12-  March 10), possibly "Joe Egg" or "Waiting for Godot."  </P> <P> The third production will be the West Coast premiere of "Yalla Bitch" by Lorna  C. Hill (April 6-May 26). Hill is the artistic director of the Ujma Theatre in  Buffalo, N.Y., where she presented and starred in her play earlier this season.  It is about a black woman's coming-of-age, Terry said.  </P> <P> "Director's Fest '90" will close the season (June 5-July 2) and will be  coordinated by Robert Leigh, a drama teacher at Rancho Santiago College in  Santa Ana. The festival will be designed as an open forum for writers,  directors and actors -- preferably from the county's ethnic communities -- who  want to stage their work.  </P></p>

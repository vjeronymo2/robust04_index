			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour pressed on industry stance MR BILL JORDAN, president of the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union (AEEU), yesterday called for the Labour party to drop its constitutional commitment to take British industry into public ownership. He told the union's conference in Llandudno that trade unions should abandon their dominant role in the party's policymaking by scrapping their block votes at party conference. His proposals are likely to be welcomed by Labour leader Mr John Smith, who is seeking to modernise Labour's programme and constitution. Mr Jordan told delegates Clause 4 of Labour's 1918 constitution, which commits the party to public ownership, had become obsolescent. 'Seventy-five years on, the Labour party is more than just a worker's party representing trade unionists at Westminster. It is a party that must represent all ordinary men and women regardless of sectional interest.' He suggested as an alternative that Labour should state its commitment 'to secure for the people of Britain the right to healthcare, education and employment and to ensure that there is equality of opportunity and justice for every citizen.' The AEEU president said the union block vote had to go to improve Labour's image. 'The sight of union barons holding aloft block votes representing thousands of union members to decide Labour policy is anathema to the majority of people,' he said. 'We should move as quickly as possible to a system of one member one vote inside the party.' Mr Jordan announced yesterday the union would hold a postal ballot of members this summer on whether they wished to keep supporting the trade unions' political fund. The AEEU leaders intend to emphasise that all the money raised through the political levy taken from their members' subscriptions will be used to finance Labour. The union is set to pay about Pounds 750,000 to the party next year. The ballot is being held 18 months earlier than required by law to ensure the state will pay three-quarters of its cost.</p>

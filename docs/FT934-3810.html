			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Government Bonds: Italian sector rallies in wake of election results Italian bonds rallied in the wake of Sunday's local elections, which brought left-wing or left-backed candidates to power in five major cities and allayed fears of a surge in support for the extreme right. Market participants were also cheered by hopes that the 1994 budget, passed by the budget committee of the lower house on Friday, will be approved before the year-end. Most of the action took place in the futures pits, with the March BTP future on Liffe rising 1.77 points from Friday to end at 114.82. Cash activity was more subdued, meanwhile, with domestic investors holding back ahead of today's holiday in Milan and tomorrow's national holiday. Despite their latest surge, some analysts feel Italian bonds still offer good value in the medium term. 'On a six-month view, I would go for unhedged exposure to the Italian market,' recommended Mr Marco Pianelli, southern Europe economist with Nomura Research Institute in London. He expects Italian bonds to continue outperforming Spanish bonds. The spread between the higher-yielding Italian 10-year benchmark and its Spanish counterpart narrowed to 73 basis points from 120 on Thursday but he expects it to shrink further to around 20 basis points by mid-1994. Moreover, he sees 'potential for sharp appreciation of the lira, which has been seriously oversold'. UK gilts ended on a firm note, with shorter maturities outperforming the rest of the yield curve on continuing hopes of near-term base rate cuts. Easing hopes now focus on the November RPI data, due to be released next week. The March long gilt contract rose by  9/32 to 117 17/32 . The Dutch government raised Fl 7.5bn from the first tap sale of its new 5.75 per cent 10-year bond. The tap was opened at an issue price of 99.35 but the finance ministry raised this in several steps to 99.60, yielding 5.80 per cent. The tap sale - the first towards the government's 1994 borrowing programme - is expected to continue until the finance ministry has raised about Fl 10bn, traders said. Dealers reported outright buying of the bonds by domestic and international investors as well as switching into the new paper from German and French bonds. German bonds were boosted in early trade by Friday's gains in the US Treasury market, but made little headway in the absence of significant flows or market-moving news. The March Bund futures contract on Liffe ended at 100.02, up 0.02 points from Friday's close. French government bonds also edged higher, lifted by the firmer tone in bunds and by hopes of more rate cuts amid continued currency strength. The December notional bond contract on Matif rose by 0.26 points to 124.50. Japanese bonds hit another six-year high as the stock market tumbled again. Rate-cut speculation intensified as the three-month certificate of deposit rate dropped to a new low of 1.98 per cent, from 2.08 per cent on Thursday, despite a tight money market operation by the Bank of Japan. The March JGB futures contract rose to 0.37 point on the day to close at 116.54. With no significant economic news to guide it, the US Treasury market climbed steadily in anticipation of reassuring inflation data due out later this week. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  25/32 ahead at 101 1/16 , with the yield falling to 6.166 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note edged  3/32 higher to 100 5/32 , to yield 4.15 per cent. Driven in part by technical factors, prices improved throughout the day, building on the market's surprisingly positive reaction to Friday's strong employment data. At the end of last week, inflation-sensitive bonds advanced despite a jump in non-farm payrolls and a sharp drop in unemployment. The advance suggested a consensus had emerged that inflationary pressures were under control. That view is expected to be reinforced when November producer price data on Thursday show no change, analysts say, while Friday's consumer price index is expected to inch 0.2 per cent higher.</p>

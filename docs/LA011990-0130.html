			<p><P> January 19, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HEALTHY YOSHIOKA JOINS AN ELITE CROWD;  </P> <P> PREPS: EL TORO SENIOR, THE COUNTY LEADER IN ASSISTS, IS BEING MENTIONED WITH  THE AREA'S TOP POINT GUARDS.  </P> <P> Oh, the intangibles of athletic performance. Who knows why a basketball  player's game goes up a level? It could be that the athlete has grown more  confident, gotten healthier or switched from Twinkies to Ding Dongs.  </P> <P> In Karie Yoshioka's case, it's a bit of all three, though granted, the switch  from Twinkies to Ding Dongs and her emergence this season as one of Orange  County's top point guards could be coincidental.  </P> <P> Yoshioka, a senior, is one of the reasons El Toro High School is 15-5 overall,  4-1 in the South Coast League and ranked second in the county behind national  power Brea-Olinda.  </P> <P> Yoshioka has been El Toro's floor leader this season. She led the county in  assists (7.7 per game) and was averaging 16.2 points and 4.1 steals after 18  games. She has been one of the county's most accurate shooters, hitting 50%  from three-point range and 58.2% overall.  </P> <P> Coaches compare her with Brea-Olinda senior Aimee McDaniel, the consensus  premier point guard in the county, a high school All-American and The Times'  player of the year as a sophomore.  </P> <P> Not bad company, especially considering Yoshioka is only 5-feet-3, 110 pounds;  she missed a great deal of her junior season with injury and illness, and she  didn't even play organized basketball until her freshman year at El Toro.  </P> <P> "I think she can do everything Aimee does," El Toro Coach Greg Yeck said. "What  Aimee has over Karie is experience. Aimee had experience at an earlier level  and has been in big ballgames and in the big program where they have been  playing the best."  </P> <P> Brea-Olinda Coach Mark Trakh wouldn't trade McDaniel for Yoshioka, but he said  Yoshioka is in the same class with McDaniel and her backcourt mate, Tammy  Blackburn.  </P> <P> "People just don't realize that Karie Yoshioka is a Division I college player,"  Yeck said. "I've got a kid here who can set up and knock down the three-pointer  and knock it down as well as anybody. Her vision is phenomenal as far as seeing  the court."  </P> <P> Yoshioka is not nearly as well known as either of the Brea-Olinda guards partly  because El Toro's program is not as prominent, because she was injured her  junior year and because, until recently, she did not assert herself.  </P> <P> "Karie was a slow build," Yeck said. "To tell the truth, I don't think Karie  really believed in her abilities until this year. She had a little voice inside  that kept saying you're good, but not that good and it was holding her back."  </P> <P> Yoshioka realized part of her responsibility this season is to help Sara Bone  (18 points a game) with the scoring load. Still, Yeck has to persuade Yoshioka  to shoot more, especially three-point shots. She didn't shoot any as a  sophomore, but this season she was 21 of 42 through 18 games.  </P> <P> Yoshioka prefers to drive and set up her teammates.  </P> <P> "I am not the kind of person who just comes up and shoots the three because I  have other shots I would rather shoot," Yoshioka said. "That is not one of my  main shots. I like the drives, drive to the jump shot. I think I have such a  high percentage because of my shot selection. If there is somebody right there,  I won't shoot."  </P> <P> Yeck said he has always believed in Yoshioka's ability. Others had only her  injury-plagued patchwork junior year to judge.  </P> <P> "Everybody we have played (this season), their attitude has been, 'Where did  she come from? I vaguely remember her being a good point guard before but not  this good,' " Yeck said. "They think some miracle thing happened over the  summer, but she just got healthy."  </P> <P> Yoshioka injured an ankle by colliding with another player in the last summer  league game before the start of her junior season. She re-sprained the ankle in  the first game of the season and had to have her ankle immobilized in a heavy  boot.  </P> <P> "I hated last year," Yoshioka said. "It was so frustrating. I would sit on the  sidelines and I wanted to to go on the court and all, but I could only cheer."  </P> <P> She missed the first two weeks of play before returning at 3/4 speed. She was  just getting back to normal when she got the flu and was out of action until  midway through the first half of South Coast League play.  </P> <P> Without Yoshioka, the Chargers had trouble handling the ball. They finished  18-10 and 9-1, losing the league title to Mission Viejo. She averaged 10.2  points and 5.6 assists.  </P> <P> Yoshioka played junior varsity as a freshman. Her sophomore season, Yeck  promoted her to the varsity bench seven games into the season. She began  outperforming the varsity guards and worked her way into the starting lineup.  </P> <P> Yoshioka recalls being terrified to be in the company of her idols -- Andrea  Young (now playing at Rice) and Elaine Youngs (playing basketball and  volleyball for UCLA). The team was ranked No. 1 in the county preseason polls.  </P> <P> "It was by far my best team, the greatest team we ever had," Yeck said. "Still  it is a year that makes me sick to my stomach when I think what could have  been."  </P> <P> Young and Youngs were sidelined almost the entire season with injury. El Toro  finished 24-6 overall and 7-3 in the league, good enough for third place, and  advanced to the Southern Section 3-A semifinals.  </P> <P> "The only way I can look back on that season and feel really good about it is  it meant that Sara Bone and Yoshioka had to come in and start as sophomores,"  Yeck said. "And now look where we are. In the long run we have to look at the  good that came out of their having to be put on the floor in a crash course.  They are now two of the better players in the county."  </P> <P> After the disappointments of her sophomore and junior seasons, Yoshioka decided  that things would be different her senior year.  </P> <P> "This season I was chosen as captain with (seniors) Sara Bone and Danielle  Silva, and we decided this is our last chance and we don't want to ruin it by  having any problems interfere," Yoshioka said.  </P> <P> "This year I was making sure, because last year was a total bummer for me."  </P> <P> Making sure means getting her ankles taped, among other things. "It is just the  motherly things, like I make sure and take a jacket and everything and don't  get cold and watch what I eat. I make sure I don't eat as much junk food.  Twinkies were my trademark. I love Twinkies. I haven't had one in quite a long  time. Since summer.  </P> <P> "I just don't eat them as much. I used to eat Twinkies before the game  sometimes. It was a sugar high. But, after the team gave me a box of Twinkies  at the end of the season and I ate the whole box, I decided to go for the Ding  Dongs, but not as much."  </P> <P> The extra care and attention and Ding Dongs have paid off.  </P></p>

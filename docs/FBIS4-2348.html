			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, April 8 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President Bill  Clinton today telephoned Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa and conveyed his regret at the prime minister's  decision to resign.    Clinton told reporters that he told Hosokawa he was  "personally very sorry to see him step down."    Clinton "commended him for his commitment to political and  economic reform in Japan," White House Press Secretary Dee Dee  Myers said in a statement.    "The President expressed his hope that the process of reform  would continue in Japan," she said, "the President stated that  he is confident that our strong bilateral relations with Japan  will continue."    Clinton praised the prime minister for his "many  achievements" during his tenure in office and described Hosokawa  as "a historic figure", State Department Spokesman Mike McCurry  said at today's news briefing.    McCurry noted that Hosokawa's government passed historic  political reform legislation that will have long-range effects  on Japan's political organization.    The Hosokawa government "made important contributions to  bringing the Uruguay Round to a successful conclusion, including  the opening Japan's rice market," he added.    The spokesman expressed hope that the prime minister's  successor and the new government of Japan will continue the  "strong and cooperative working relationship" between the U.S.  and Japan.    McCurry also stressed, the United States "continue to look  for meaningful steps by Japan to reduce its current account  surplus and address market access barriers."</p>

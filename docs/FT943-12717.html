			<p>940723 FT  23 JUL 94 / Gas bills set to increase, MPs told Gas prices may have to rise for some consumers as competition is introduced into the domestic market, British Gas has told the government. In a letter to cabinet ministers and selected MPs Mr Cedric Brown, the chief executive, says that the removal of cross subsidies meant 'there will need to be a period of transition in which some price adjustments are necessary'. This is because small consumers are subsidised by large consumers. Competition is expected to be more intense among large gas users however, and British Gas has already said it may have to cut prices in that segment of the market to protect its position. This would mean that charges might have to go up for small users. Mr Brown confirms in his letter that British Gas would like to see the date proposed for the start of phased-in competition - April 1996 - put back. He stresses that this is because more time is needed to introduce changes, including completely new computer and operational systems. British Gas remains committed to full competition by the government's target date of April 1998.</p>

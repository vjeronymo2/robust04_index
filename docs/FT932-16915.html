			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / International Company News: Caisse de Depot in move to take control of Univa THE Caisse de Depot, the Quebec public pension plan's investment arm, is negotiating control of Univa, Canada's second biggest food distributor, with the two other large shareholders in the foods group. The Caisse, which holds 17 per cent of Univa, last month declined a joint CDollars 11 a share bid worth CDollars 1.06bn (USDollars 842m) from Blackstone, the New York investment group, and Mr Bertin Nadeau, Montreal entrepreneur. Mr Nadeau owns 26 per cent of Univa and the Sobey family, of Nova Scotia, 25 per cent. As a result of the Caisse's refusal, Blackstone withdrew the bid. Jean Claude Delorme, chairman, said the Caisse exercised its rights as a long-term shareholder and believed its Univa investment would grow substantially.</p>

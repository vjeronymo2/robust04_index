			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Ministry Under Secretary Ozdem </F> Sanberk by Mehmet Ali Kislali; place and date not given]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Kislali] Why is pressure  being applied with regard to Cyprus? Why are the United States  and the United Nations pressuring Turkey as though there were no  other problems in the world?    [Sanberk] We ask ourselves the same question. Why? There  is no bloodshed in Cyprus. No genocide. No threat. I believe  that there is immense pressure on the part of the Greek lobby in  the United States. The U.S. Administration has influence in the  United Nations. Moreover, the United States believes that there  is now an opportunity to solve this problem. The  confidence-building measures package is on the table.    [Kislali] But this package has not retained its original  form. It was altered greatly, in line with the Greek Cypriot  stand.    [Sanberk] Yes, it was changed significantly. It is not  acceptable as it stands today.    [Kislali] How do you assess Russia's attitude? Its policy  appears to have changed. The Russians began intervening in the  Caucasus. Do they not constitute a source of concern?    [Sanberk] Yes, I believe so. On one hand, we are following  the developments with concern, but on the other hand, we are  keeping the communications channels with the highest-level  administrators, such as Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin, open. These  people are exerting great efforts to institute reforms in  Russia. This is actually an impossible mission. The Russians  are undertaking a military presence in southern Europe for the  first time since World War II.    [Kislali] Is the fact that they came to Bosnia not an issue  as well?    [Sanberk] In the wake of NATO's ultimatum to the Serbs in  Bosnia, the Russians made a very clever move and transferred 400  troops to Bosnia in order to keep the peace. This military  presence naturally accords them a political image as well. They  wield great influence over the Serbs there. Considering the  situation during Tito's reign, the presence of Russian troops in  Bosnia is a very new phenomenon. If we also take Russia's  presence in Georgia into consideration and add Ukraine and  Bulgaria to the Russian sphere, then Turkey finds itself facing  a crescent.    [Kislali] Is this a development Turkey should take into  consideration?    [Sanberk] Given the ambiguity in Europe and Ukraine's  situation, I would say yes. Furthermore, the United States is  distancing itself, and NATO is not the same as before.  Therefore, we are concerned. We also view the future of the  Russian Federation as unsure. The Russians also have three  categories of problems. Their economic problems are impossible  to solve, because they are unable to obtain the necessary funds  to support their stability programs and resolve the immense  problems. They want to carry out the economic reforms and  establish democratic institutions, but this is not easy. They  also have the problem of nationalities. Therefore, we are not  very optimistic that the Russian Government will succeed in  implementing the reforms.    [Kislali] What can we expect in Russia?    [Sanberk] They must hold elections. Will they turn into a  nation-state in the aftermath of an empire or will they pursue a  policy of restoring the empire? For the time being, they do not  know which borders end where and who should be considered a  Russian. Therefore, not only we but countries like Estonia and  Lithuania are also concerned about Russia. As a matter of fact,  Germany is also concerned about Russia's future moves.    [Kislali] What is this concern based on?    [Sanberk] An empire cannot be a democratic state, and a  nondemocratic country cannot implement reforms. Under the  current circumstances, not all the support given to Yeltsin is  going toward democracy, although this was the main reason for  the support.    [Kislali] Turkey's view is probably being conveyed to our  Western allies, for example to the United States. Their views  are different, are they not?    [Sanberk] Yes, our views are conveyed to them. Developments  are taking place in U.S. foreign policy. We discussed this with  Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott last year. Many things  have happened since then. During the crisis, the vulnerability  of the Russian parliamentary system was seen.    [Kislali] And if you look at the situation from our  viewpoint?    [Sanberk] From our viewpoint, a chaotic Russia would be to  our disadvantage. Like a vacuum around us. What we want to do  is to help Russia's democratization and economic reforms.  However, we have economic problems too. Despite that, we  extended a loan of $1.2 billion to Russia. Of that, they have  used $700 million. Our volume of trade is $1.5 billion. There  are Turkish contractors there, both in the Russian Federation  and in other republics.    [Kislali] What are the latest contracting figures?    [Sanberk] We have investments of $2.5 billion in Russia,  $500 million in Azerbaijan, $430 million in Kazakhstan, $440  million in Uzbekistan, $180 million in Kyrgyzstan, and $187  million in Turkestan, even though we do not have political  relations with it. Turkmenistan is the most important of all; we  have investments worth $1.2 billion there. These figures make  up 7 percent of the world's construction investments.    [Kislali] Are these activities very important for Turkey?    [Sanberk] Of course, because the contractors use Turkish  workers in these projects. They establish solidarity with the  peoples of those countries. Our total investments in the  Russian Federation and the Central Asian republics exceed $5  billion.    [Kislali] Where does the Black Sea Economic Cooperation  project stand?    [Sanberk] It is not as ambitious about forming an  organization as the Common Market or the European Free Trade  Association. For the obstacles to be overcome, the states must  cooperate. Efforts must be made to facilitate investments among  the member countries. Trade must be made easier. Medium-size  entrepreneurs must be encouraged. The necessary institutions  have been set up. The chairman must be Russian. We are waiting  for that. It will take time. [passage omitted]    [Kislali] How do the U.S. and NATO policies toward Bosnia  affect Turkey?    [Sanberk] They cause in us a lack of confidence in the  future. We do not know how long this post-Cold War period will  last and how it will end. Also, when other confrontations will  arise -- and they probably will -- what will happen to the  principles we tried to protect together during the Cold War?  Will the world become chaotic? Despite that, we are  approaching the developments realistically. We offer our  cooperation to our European and American allies.</p>

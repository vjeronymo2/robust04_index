			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / Australia unveils budget to boost growth AUSTRALIA'S Labor government yesterday unveiled an expansionary budget intended to stimulate economic growth and reduce unemployment before the next election, due by mid-1993. Mr John Dawkins, the federal treasurer (finance minister), said the government would provide 'a strong but temporary stimulus' of ADollars 4.5bn (Pounds 1.7bn) over the next two years to help create hundreds of thousands of jobs. The stimulus will increase the budget deficit to ADollars 13.4bn in the year to next July, compared with ADollars 9.3bn in 1991-92. However, the budget contained few surprises. Most of the job-creation programmes were announced earlier this year in a series of economic statements following an 18-month recession. Mr Dawkins said the economy would grow by only 3 per cent this year, in spite of the proposed stimulus. Mr Paul Keating, the prime minister, forecast in February that growth would reach 4.75 per cent in 1992-1993. Mr Dawkins said the slower-than-expected growth was due to drought, subdued economic activity in many of Australia's main trading partners, and fragile business confidence. He said the weak recovery meant that unemployment was likely to remain above the politically sensitive level of 10 per cent until June, the last possible date for an election. The current account deficit is forecast to increase from 3.1 per cent to 3.3 per cent of gross domestic product as imports grow in line with demand. Inflation is expected to rise from 1.2 per cent to 3 per cent. Mr Dawkins said the government would honour an earlier promise to cut income tax by ADollars 8.6bn over several years, beginning in 1994. However, he said the cuts might have to be balanced by increases in indirect taxes. The government has abandoned plans announced in February to balance the budget by 1996. Mr Dawkins said the deficit would be eliminated 'as soon as possible'. Mr Martin Ferguson, president of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, said the budget was 'reasonable and responsible'. The conservative opposition called it 'a vote-buying spending spree'. The financial markets reacted favourably to the budget, which was in line with expectations. However, some economists said the government's revenue forecasts were optimistic. The budget forecasts privatisation receipts of ADollars 1.6bn, mostly from the sale of Qantas and Australian Airlines. The government will also try to sell other assets, including its uranium stockpile.</p>

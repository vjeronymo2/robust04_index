			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Business SNARK Transcaucasia Economic News" 6th </F> issue for 28 May - 4 Jun]    [Text] Baku -- "No word may be of any reform, much more of  privatization, in a state of war. Azerbaijan is not ready for  all that. In present conditions, privatization would mean  squandering of public property and seizure of people's wealth by  mafia groups", told the Azerbaijani Prime-Minister Suret  Guseynov at the Ministers' Cabinet meeting May 27.    The state of credit system in the republic was discussed at  the meeting. Guseynov spoke again in favor of state enterprise  support by credits. He noticed specially that priority should  be given to oil and gas industry and agriculture.    Earlier, during the March meeting, Guseynov also emphasized  that reforms in economy cannot be carried out in conditions of  war.    While the total amount of credits increased during the last  year for 5.9 times, the sum of over-time payments grew for 28.6  times. "The major burden of overdue payments lies on fuel and  power complex, and on agricultural facilities", observed  Guseynov.    In order to improve the financial discipline, Guseynov  ordered the ministries and concerns to pass the state companies'  accounts to the state banks. In their turn, the state banks  shall grant credits to the fuel and power industries.    Suret Guseynov noted that the situation did not change  though  a number of top-rank officials were dismissed. He stressed the  importance of strengthening the administrative measures and  spoke in favor of addition powers for Ministers' Cabinet.</p>

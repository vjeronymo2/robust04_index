			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Emerging Markets: A surge of funds to eastern Europe - The Emerging Investor Fund managers have in the past fortnight raised Dollars 300m for investment in the emerging markets of eastern Europe in the largest burst of fundraising since the fall of communism five years ago. Shares in the Baring group's Dollars 180m First NIS Regional Fund and Pictet's Dollars 56m First Russian Frontiers Trust begin trading this week. Invesco's East Europe Development Fund has also tapped the markets, for a Dollars 75m boost. Nor are the latest efforts the last: CS First Boston and Edmond de Rothschild Securities are designing a Czech Value Fund to invest in undervalued domestic Czech voucher funds. And the regional and country funds are the most public face of portfolio investment into eastern Europe. General emerging markets funds managed by Templeton, Genesis, and others are also committing investment although they make no disclosed allocation to the former communist bloc. Even some hedge funds, burnt by the bond markets, are also turning for high returns to east European investments. Quantum, the fund run by Mr George Soros, the self-confessed speculator, bought a shareholding in Fotex, the Hungarian retail company. Mr Soros, who has set up charitable foundations in eastern Europe, recently put aside his concern about conflicts of interest and allowed his funds to invest in the region. Altogether the inflow of portfolio investment probably now exceeds that of foreign direct investment. International investment banks like CS First Boston have found to their surprise that securities trading that arises from financial investment has rapidly overtaken fees earned from mergers and acquisitions advice as a source of revenue. This record burst of activity is all the more striking for its timing. Rising interest rates have drawn investors out of equity and especially out of marginal markets, which is what east European bourses still for the moment remain. The three established east European stock markets, Warsaw, Prague and Budapest, are all down on their peaks earlier this year. The Prague index fell 34 per cent between its introduction in April and October. Warsaw share prices, which rose the fastest, have halved since March. The two largest funds launched during eastern Europe's stock market boom, CSFB's Dollars 200m Central European Growth Fund and Baring's Dollars 120m Emerging Europe Trust, have both suffered declines in net asset value. They fell victim, an emerging markets analyst says, to the general tendency for managers to raise cash during a bull market and invest into the market as it drops back. Nor have funds with a longer track record all performed so much better. John Govett's Hungarian Investment Company, which raised Dollars 100m in 1990, now has a market capitalisation of Dollars 71.5m. In as unpredictable a region as eastern Europe there is a resounding investment success for every failure. Invesco's EEDF, headed by Mr Roy Bracher, has shown compound annual growth in NAV per share of 41.5 per cent, a far better record than any western investment fund. Mr Bracher compares his approach with that of Warren Buffett, the legendary US long-term investor. 'We invest in companies that we know and like,' he says. Mr Bracher prefers low-tech industries like chocolate and ice-cream making. EEDF leans towards unquoted investments and takes a relatively long time horizon - two to five years. The strategy, or at least EEDF's performance, was enough to persuade investors to commit another Dollars 75m to the fund. It may also show investors in general that it is possible to make money in eastern Europe. Equity in Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary, also looks fundamentally more attractive than it did. The price correction has killed the prospect of dramatic and immediate capital gain, and has made fundamental value more attractive. But, says Ms Nancy Curtin, head of emerging European investments at Baring Asset Management: 'It has eradicated a lot of the frothiness in the markets.' But the strongest new draw of all is Russia. It is no accident that two of the three new funds are aimed at the former Soviet Union, and EEDF also says it sees good value in Russian companies. The market has opened up tremendously in the past few months. Mass privatisation has put about 80 per cent of the corporate sector into private hands. Most of these companies are an investor's nightmare, but a few - like Lukoil, the oil company, and Gazprom, the gas producer - are what one fund manager calls 'world-class companies'. Oil assets were privatised at about 4 US cents a barrel of proven reserves. That measure has since tripled, but still stands far short of the Dollars 7 that a barrel of oil in the ground would cost if an investor bought a US oil company. A telephone access line in Hungary, another former communist country, commands a stock market valuation 10 times that of a Russian one. Fund managers believe that is cheap, even after factoring in Russia's particular risks - the sheer opacity of the companies and the burden upon them of providing social services. 'All but nationalisation has been discounted in these market values,' says Ms Curtin. The fear of shares simply disappearing from registers and other horrors of custody and settlement are enough to put off all but the hardiest or foolhardiest of investors. One Russian investor recently accused an aluminium company of erasing Dollars 300m worth of its shares. But Chase Manhattan and other international banks are moving to set up custodial services which at least approach the standards required by western investors. Moreover, Mr Anatoly Chubais, the new deputy prime minister for the economy, has put securities reform at the top of his agenda. The discounts should narrow as custody and settlement improve, and Russia's equity market emerges from its infancy. Emerging markets funds hope they will gain as valuations in east and west converge. But ease of investing is a mixed blessing for these specialist entities. Their own backers are pension funds, unprepared or legally prohibited from investing in markets without proper custody. Emerging markets funds are indispensable intermediaries. Already some of the largest Russian banks and natural resources extractors like Gazprom, the gas company, are planning issues of global depository receipts.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       TEN BEST PERFORMING STOCKS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                            Friday   Week on week change Stock                            Country  25/11/94  Dollars      %  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hualon Tiejran                    Taiwan   0.8999    0.0941    11.67 Philippine National Bank     Philippines  13.4737    0.9890     7.92 Far Eastern Textile               Taiwan   1.5100    0.1036     7.37 Cia De Aceros Del Pacifico         Chile   4.6182    0.2824     6.51 Vitro                             Mexico   6.8185    0.3590     5.56 Alpha Leasing                     Greece  24.0082    1.2524     5.50 Bagley                         Argentina   3.9992    0.2000     5.26 Koc Yatrim                        Turkey   0.8058    0.0395     5.16 Banco Wiese                        Peru    4.9507    0.2405     5.11 Formosa Chemical &amp; Fibre         Taiwan    1.4490    0.0692     5.01  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Baring Securities  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

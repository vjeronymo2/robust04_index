			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / International Company News: Kaufhof profits set to rise 20% PROFITS at Kaufhof, the German retailing group, should rise by at least 20 per cent this year, despite the more difficult trading climate, Mr Jens Odewald, chief executive, told the annual meeting. Kaufhof, which has expanded beyond department stores into specialist outlets and tourism, has benefited considerably from the increased business opportunities opened up by German unification. Last year, its net profits rose by 38 per cent to DM166m (Dollars 102m). Turnover was up by 21.5 per cent to DM17.8bn, though the increase would have been only 12 per cent without the new business in eastern Germany, where thegroup has invested nearly DM400m. However, the west German economy has slowed down recently and consumers have had to bear higher direct and indirect taxes to help pay for unity. Mr Odewald said Kaufhof's turnover in the first half was 13 per cent higher at DM8.9bn, a growth rate with which it was 'not unsatisfied'. He said the group's aim in coming years was to grow at twice the rate of the retail sector. In tourism, he expected turnover to grow by around 30 per cent this year. Fresenius, the drugs and medical technology group, yesterday forecast increased profits for this year and announced plans for a DM174m rights issue. The share offer is on a one-for-three basis at DM440 a share. The company said its business in the current year was running positively, and that it expected growth in turnover of more than 10 per cent to around DM1.5bn plus an improvement in net profit. After-tax profits in 1991 totalled DM15.9m.</p>

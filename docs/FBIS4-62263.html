			<p>BFN     [Text] The memorandum on political partnership in the name  of nationwide accord, social stability and unity of the Kyrgyz  people will not be signed on 13 May, as was expected. INTERFAX  learned this from sources close to the Kyrgyz Government.    This document was supported by all political parties,  public,  cultural and national centers. The memorandum was expected to  be signed by Kyrgyz President Askar Akayev, parliament's  Chairman Medetkan Sherimkulov, Premier Abbas Dzhumagulov, the  Assembly of Kyrgyz Peoples and nine registered political parties.    The signatories were meant to undertake to refrain from  actions which could deteriorate the political situation and  trigger off public disorder, to back the policy of the  republic's leadership and to hold consultations on all major  issues of interior policy.    INTERFAX learned that some connection had been suggested to  exist between non-signing of the memorandum and the president's  press service's statement circulated on 11 May accusing the  government of failure in taxation and budget policy. The  government considered this as quite unexpected actions, which  might lead to negative consequences.    According to some sources, Dzhumagulov had intended to sign  the memorandum but postponed the signing when the situation  mentioned above emerged and went on a working visit to a Kyrgyz  region.</p>

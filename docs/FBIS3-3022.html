			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 16 (XINHUA) -- The Revolutionary  Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK) today called on the  Taiwan authorities to agree to formal contacts between the  Communist Party of China (CPC) and the Kuomintang in Taiwan.    RCCK Vice Chairman Li Ganliu made the call on behalf of his  party at Wednesday's [16 March] meeting of the National  Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative  Conference (CPPCC).    "The Taiwan authorities should abandon illusions, face the  reality, accept CPC's proposals on opening talks between the two  parties and establishing direct exchanges of mail, trade, and  shipping and air services between the two sides of the Taiwan  straits, and make decisions that will benefit the Chinese  nation," he said.    Relations across the Straits and the situation relating to  the peaceful reunification of China have undergone significant  changes in the past year, and the major trend of changes is  positive, he said.    Li reviewed development of relations between the two sides:  economic links between the two sides are growing, with Taiwan  investment in the mainland increasing by a big margin; trade and  personnel exchanges between the two sides are expanding rapidly;  and agreements reached between the two non-governmental  organizations, namely the Strait Exchange Foundation of Taiwan  and the Association of Relations Across the Taiwan Straits of  the mainland, marked a historical step forward in relations  between the two sides.    He pointed out, however, that the Taiwan authorities  stubbornly cling to their policy of blocking direct commercial  and communication links with the mainland. On the other hand,  they are pursuing a splittist policy of "two Chinas" on the  international scene by carrying out "money campaigns" and  "flexible diplomacy." Last year, they stepped up activities for  Taiwan's "return to the United Nations" in an attempt to gain  "dual recognition." After the attempt was thwarted, they have  resorted to "holiday-making diplomacy" recently.    Facts have shown that there has not been a fundamental  change  in the Taiwan authorities' wrong stand on the reunification of  China. Their activities are in contradiction with their  repeatedly proclaimed stand of "one China."    He said the reunification of China is an irresistible trend  of the times and the aspirations of people on both sides of the  straits. Any attempts to delay the cause of reunification and  to create "two Chinas" are doomed to fail, he said.</p>

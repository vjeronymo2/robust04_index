			<p><P> October 4, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SIMMONS IS PLAYING THE ODDS;  </P> <P> COLLEGE FOOTBALL: TITAN LINEMAN, WHO SUFFERED A SPINAL INJURY IN 1988, SAYS  JOYS OF THE SPORT OUTWEIGH THE RISK OF PARALYSIS.  </P> <P> His physique might resemble Disneyland's Matterhorn, but Mike Simmons, Cal  State Fullerton's 6-foot-7, 320-pound lineman, would not compare his life to a  roller-coaster ride.  </P> <P> "It's been more like a jump across a canyon," says Simmons, who transferred  from Arizona State to Fullerton two weeks before the season and is now the  Titans' starting offensive tackle. "When I'm going straight, everything feels  good. But when I go down, I go down hard."  </P> <P> Simmons fell hard and deep in the spring of 1988 when he suffered what appeared  to be a career-ending spinal cord injury. Doctors advised Simmons, who was used  frequently as a reserve at Arizona State as a redshirt freshman in 1987, not to  play again.  </P> <P> Simmons sat out the next two football seasons, pleading with doctors to give  him medical clearance and trying to adjust to having so much free time; he got  into trouble and even was arrested once. Never again did he wear a Sun Devil  uniform.  </P> <P> Fed up with the battle, Simmons picked up a college directory last August and  started dialing football coaches around the West and Southwest. The phone rang  in Cal State Fullerton's office.  </P> <P> "It was like fate," said Simmons, who had only one season of eligibility  remaining when he transferred. "They were in a meeting talking about how they  needed offensive linemen when I called. They said, 'When can you get here?' "  </P> <P> Simmons, whose nickname is "Big City," arrived in mid-August and was tested by  Fullerton trainers, an orthopedic surgeon and a neurosurgeon. Simmons didn't  receive final medical clearance until after the season opener, but he has  played in three of the past four Titan games. He missed one because of an ankle  injury.  </P> <P> For Simmons, an All-American at Tulsa (Okla.) McLain High School in 1985, the  joys of playing football outweigh the dangers of playing.  </P> <P> "If something (serious) were to happen to me, as long as I didn't die, I think  my life would be just as meaningful," Simmons said. "I'm a child development  major and you can do just as much for children from a wheelchair."  </P> <P> But is it worth that risk?  </P> <P> "If nothing happens and I make the pros, it was definitely worth it," Simmons  said. "And if I don't make the pros, at least I still came back and did  something I felt I could do."  </P> <P> Simmons wasn't sure what he'd be able to do after his injury. At the time,  moving a limb or two took precedent over making the pros.  </P> <P> During a contact blocking drill, Simmons found himself amid a pile of players.  He isn't sure if it was a knee or a helmet, but something hit Simmons hard in  the back and his body went numb.  </P> <P> Everyone else got up from the pile. Simmons remained on the ground, face down,  motionless.  </P> <P> During a three-day hospital stay, part of it in an intensive care unit, doctors  diagnosed the injury as spinal shock. Simmons' spinal cord had been jarred,  leaving him temporarily paralyzed.  </P> <P> X-rays didn't indicate any dislocations or fractures in his back or neck, and  Simmons regained full movement within three days.  </P> <P> Although extensive testing did not reveal neurological damage, Phoenix  neurosurgeon Hal Pittman and ASU team physicians Norman Fee and Richard Lee  concluded in August, 1988, that the risk of permanent paralysis was too great  to allow Simmons to return.  </P> <P> "I don't think anybody in their right mind would let him play," ASU Coach Larry  Marmie told the Phoenix Gazette at the time.  </P> <P> But when Simmons arrived at Fullerton, Titan trainer Jerry Lloyd felt the  bigger question was why would they not let him play? Fullerton team physician  Joseph Cummings gave Simmons medical clearance after consulting with  neurologist Don DeFeo.  </P> <P> "They felt he had a slight chance of injury, but only a little more than any  other player," Lloyd said. "They thought it was within safe enough limits for  Mike to return to competition."  </P> <P> All players must sign a statement saying they understand the risks of  participating in football, and that playing can result in serious injury or  death, but Lloyd made Simmons sign an additional statement saying he also  risked paralysis.  </P> <P> No problem, Simmons said.  </P> <P> "At ASU I was ready to sign a waiver relieving them and the doctors of all  liability -- I even talked to a lawyer -- but they wouldn't take it," Simmons  said. "That wasn't good enough for them."  </P> <P> Simmons says his back has caused him only minor discomfort. A bigger problem  has been getting into playing shape, re-learning the techniques that made him  one of the nation's top high school linemen in 1985 and learning a new  offensive system.  </P> <P> "I found I had forgotten a lot of things, so coming back was like teaching a  baby to walk," Simmons said. "I'm still behind. I'm nowhere near where I'd like  to be, but I'm getting better each game."  </P> <P> Better but not bigger. Simmons reported to camp at 330 pounds but has trimmed  to 320.  </P> <P> "He might be the biggest human being we've had here, but he's too big," Titan  Coach Gene Murphy said. "He could be more effective if he was a little smaller,  but it was a wham-bam-get-ready-to-play situation. He didn't have time to get  into great shape."  </P> <P> Simmons believes there's still time to improve and impress some professional  scouts this season. But even if he isn't drafted or doesn't receive any NFL  tryout invitations, he'll still consider this year worthwhile.  </P> <P> Playing football has at least kept him occupied. That wasn't the case at  Arizona State, where he began frequenting nightclubs and seemed to attract  trouble.  </P> <P> Simmons hit a low in March, 1989, when he was arrested by ASU police and  charged with felony theft. Police alleged that Simmons stole a 10mm handgun  from the room of a student in a school residence hall.  </P> <P> Simmons declined to discuss the incident, but said he pleaded guilty to the  charge and received two years' probation.  </P> <P> "I did something and I had to pay for it," Simmons said. "I'm not ashamed of  it. Like I said, when I go down, I really go down."  </P> <P> Now, he appears on his way up.  </P> <P> "Some of our people talked to people at Arizona State, and they said he was a  bad act," Murphy said. "But he's been anything but that here."  </P></p>

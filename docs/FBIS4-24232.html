			<p>BFN     [Text] French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said this  morning that the rebels' opposition to French intervention is  dying down. Monique Mas has just spoken to Major Emmanuel  Ndahiro, military spokesman of the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic  Front], and asked him if the RPF has softened its stand:    [Begin Ndahiro recording, in English fading into French  translation] Not at all. We have not changed our position  toward the French intervention. Considering past French  actions, we are still opposing it. They were responsible for  the killings in Rwanda and we have no reason whatsoever to trust  them. As you know, they have never helped solve our problems.  We could not prevent them from coming here. What RPF leaders  say is that if the French limit their intervention to the  Zairean border and to humanitarian actions we will not clash  with them. We issue a warning to the French: History has taught  us that they have not come to rescue 8,000 people, but to  protect the criminals who have murdered more than 500,000  people. [end recording]</p>

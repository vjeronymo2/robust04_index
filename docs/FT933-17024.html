			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / Chief of private army to be PM: Azeri strong man takes command THE MAN whose private army forced the elected president of Azerbaijan to flee his post was yesterday named prime minister and 'supreme commander' of the largely Moslem Caucasian republic. Mr Surat Husseinov, aged 35, was nominated by Mr Gaidar Alyev, the former Azeri Communist party leader who is now the powerful chairman of parliament. He promised in a speech to the deputies that the creation of a national army to prosecute the war against Armenia in Nagorno Karabakh would be 'among his first steps'. He also promised to end the country's economic crisis and ensure an adequate supply of food and other products to the population. As part of an agreement thrashed out in the past three days between Mr Alyev and Mr Husseinov the new prime minister will control the defence, interior and security ministries, centralising all armed forces under his command. He told parliament that 'the conditions already exist for ending the war which has been thrust on Azerbaijan in the immediate future. If diplomatic steps are not successful, then it will be done through war - and Azerbaijan will win.' Mr Alyev, who assumes the function of head of state relinquished by the deposed President Abulfaz Elchibey, called for the people to unite to end the 'civil' war in the country. He blamed Mr Elchibey, president for only a year, for the collapse of the Azeri forces and the capture of Mardakaert, the last Azeri-held town in the Armenian-dominated enclave of Karabakh. Mr Husseinov sought to calm the fears of oil companies which had been expecting to sign a Dollars 40m (Pounds 26.6m) deal with the Azeri government this month to develop the rich reserves in the Caspian Sea, saying 'the present government approach to this will be more sensible and civilised'. However, he spoke after Mr Sabit Bagirov, head of the state oil company, had given notice of his resignation, saying: 'I have received indications from our new rulers that I am not wanted.' Mr Bagirov had negotiated the contracts with companies including Amoco, British Petroleum and Pennzoil. Mr Alyev and Mr Husseinov now face the immense task of restoring morale to forces shattered by constant reversals while dealing with the refugee crisis of many thousands.</p>

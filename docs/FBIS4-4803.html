			<p>BFN     [Text] New York, April 5 KYODO -- North Korean Foreign  Minister Kim Yong-nam warned U.N. Secretary General Butrus  Butrus-Ghali in a letter last month that war might return to the  Korean peninsula over Pyongyang's alleged nuclear arms  development program.    In the March 24 letter released by the United Nations on  Monday [4 April], Kim suggested that if the U.N. Security  Council followed U.S. calls for a resolution against Pyongyang,  the unfortunate history of the 1950s might return to the Korean  peninsula.    Last month, after a team of experts reported difficulties  inspecting North Korean nuclear sites, the United States began  lobbying members of the Security Council for a resolution urging  Pyongyang to comply with international safeguard accords.    In the letter, Kim also declared that North Korea would  resume its peaceful nuclear activities and warned that it may  follow through with its decision last year to withdraw from the  nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.    On March 31, at the urging of China and nonaligned nations,  the Security Council adopted a softened presidential statement  calling on Pyongyang to comply with the inspections demands of  the International Atomic Energy Agency.    The letter requested Butrus-Ghali's help in attaining a fair  resolution to the issue.</p>

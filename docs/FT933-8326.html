			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / Clinton comes out fighting on healthcare: President defends plan for employer-funded insurance PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday started his campaign for sweeping reform of the US healthcare system with a strong defence of the need for employers to provide health insurance for workers. Mr Clinton told a meeting of state governors that a mandate stipulating employers provide insurance was the only fair way of making sure everyone received medical coverage. The employer mandate is expected to be one of the most controversial elements in the healthcare debate. It is hotly opposed by small businesses and by many Republicans, who believe it will force companies to lay off workers to avoid additional costs. Although the health reform plan will not be formally presented until next month, Mr Clinton outlined a number of principles. The plan must provide medical security not only to those who now have no insurance, but also to those who are afraid of losing coverage. It should build on the 'managed care' concept, maintaining the private-sector health insurance industry but setting up alliances in each state to negotiate for cheaper healthcare and providing new incentives for preventive medicine. Mr Clinton also backed insurance reform, massive cuts in paperwork, increases in medical research budgets and an effort to include the workers' compensation system, which covers job-related injuries and illnesses. One significant proposal would be for the cost of health insurance policies for the self-employed to be 100 per cent tax deductible, instead of 25 per cent as at present. But Mr Clinton's strongest appeal was over the employer mandate. Mr Ira Magaziner, the president's principal healthcare adviser, said afterwards that an employer mandate would be phased in over five to seven years. Employers would be required to pay 80 per cent of the insurance premiums, but their total cost would be capped at a percentage of their payroll - probably 3.5 per cent for small businesses and 7-7.5 per cent for large companies. Mr Clinton said both employers and employees needed to take more responsibility for the cost of healthcare. 'Every American should know that healthcare is not something financed by the tooth fairy,' he said. He also warned it would not be easy to win passage for healthcare reform legislation, and criticised the politics of Washington. 'Back east, where I work, consensus is often turned into cave-in. People who try to work together and listen to one another, instead of beat each other up, are accused of being weak, not strong,' Mr Clinton complained. 'The people that really score are the people that lay one good lick on you in the newspaper every day instead of the people that get up and go to work.'</p>

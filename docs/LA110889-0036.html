			<p><P> November 8, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> KLOVE, EMMONS, YARROW TAKE EARLY LEAD IN WESTLAKE VILLAGE CITY COUNCIL RACE  </P> <P> Early election returns in Westlake Village showed incumbent City Councilman  Irwin A. Shane trailing five other candidates Tuesday in a race for three seats  on the council.  </P> <P> Incumbents Shane and Bonnie Klove sought reelection to the Westlake Village  City Council, but Mayor Franklin D. Pelletier declined to run again.  </P> <P> Four challengers entered the race for the three at-large seats. They are former  City Manager James E. Emmons, vocational education teacher Sybil Nisenholz,  office manager Joanne Robinson and homeowner association president Douglas R.  Yarrow.  </P> <P> Emmons, Klove and Yarrow were the early leaders, followed by Nisenholz,  Robinson and Shane.  </P> <P> Emmons, the town's city manager from 1982 to 1988, was considered by many in  Westlake Village to be a strong contender for the seat left open by Pelletier's  departure.  </P> <P> Westlake Village voters also were being asked to approve an initiative to raise  the city's constitutional spending limit, a measure city officials have said is  necessary to finance a planned new library and city hall. The early returns  showed overwhelming voter support for the initiative.  </P> <P> Klove and Shane were seeking their third terms on the council. Yarrow said he  viewed Shane as the more vulnerable of the two.  </P> <P> The principal issue in the campaign has been Westlake North, a 131-acre  development project proposed for vacant land north of the Ventura Freeway.  </P> <P> A majority of the five-member council -- Klove, Shane, and Pelletier -- have  said they want to make a decision on Westlake North next week, before any new  council members take office.  </P> <P> If Shane is defeated, and the council does not postpone the matter, the  decision would be made by a council with two lame-duck members.  </P> <P> The project is being proposed by Westlake Village Associates, a firm run by  Daniel K. Ludwig. It would include about 1.5 million square feet of office  space. Ludwig recently scaled back the project slightly, reducing the maximum  building height from six stories to five and cutting the number of multifamily  housing units from 400 to 250.  </P> <P> But the project has remained controversial.  </P> <P> Klove and Shane were elected after the city's 1981 incorporation. Yarrow,  president of the Westlake Trails Homeowners Assn., recently organized his  neighborhood to persuade the council to put a planned library in an industrial  park instead of their residential area.  </P></p>

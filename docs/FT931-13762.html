			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / Names' leader resists pressure MR Alfred Doll-Steinberg, a leading Lloyd's Name, yesterday resisted pressure for his resignation as chairman of the Gooda Walker Action Group. The group of loss-making Lloyd's Names - individuals whose capital backs the insurance market - is co-ordinating legal action in a bid to recover more than Pounds 200m of insurance losses.

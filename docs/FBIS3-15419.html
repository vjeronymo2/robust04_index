			<p>Language: <F P=105> Latvian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Janis Kulmanis: "National Forces Might Call a </F> Referendum on Skrunda]    [Text] Riga, 22 Feb -- Several representatives of the Union  of National Forces [NSA] stated at a press conference today that  there is a possibility that a popular referendum on the question  of the Skrunda radar station may be organized.    As DIENA has already reported, the NSA has adopted a  statement protesting against the Latvian Government's agreement  with Russia to keep the Skrunda radar station in operation for  another four years, with an additional 18 months for its  dismantling. Quite a number of representatives of the  organizations included in the NSA expressed the view that  Skrunda is similar to other bases which Russia has promised to  vacate by 31 August of this year.    Baiba Petersone, representative of the Movement for Latvia's  National Independence [LNNK] said that although Latvia has a  democratically elected parliament and the national situation is  more favorable than it was in 1939, the interstate negotiations  are being carried on in secret, with the people and even the  Saeima [parliament] not being informed. Petersone said the  national forces will maintain their rights for means of direct  democratic action, by initiating the referendum and using other  means of nonviolent resistance.    Aigars Jirgens, a representative of the Fatherland and  Freedom organization, has criticized the fact that the Cabinet  of Ministers was not given the right to authorize the delegation  to talks with Russia and give consent for the continued  operation of the Skrunda radar station. The Latvian Government  can not count on support from the people, he said. He said also  that he has faith in Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis, who has  promised not to sign an agreement allowing for the continued  operation of the Skrunda radar station.    Uldis Augstkalns, leader of the Latvian People's Front,  expressed the belief that for Russia, the Skrunda stations is  not so much a matter of security than of policy, and that by the  agreement, which is being prepared by the two state delegations,  the Latvian Government is accepting Russia's strategic interests  in Latvia.    U. Augstkalns stated that to have a bad agreement is better  than to have none at all. He also spoke in favor of a popular  referendum on this question, because this is a matter of  national survival.    The representative of the Association of Latvian National  Soldiers was indignant: We have not learned from the experience  of our history, and this applies to the current policy of the  Latvian Government.    DIENA has already reported, the Club of Environment  Protection has printed 10,000 postcards to send to the Saeima  demanding the immediate dismantlement of the Skrunda station and  withdrawal of Russian soldiers. All in all, 4,000 cards will be  disseminated by LNNK.    In reply to a question from DIENA if there is a possibility  to succeed in concluding such an agreement with Russia, Ilgonis  Klavins, representative of Christian Democrats, expressed a  skeptical view regarding the very sense of a bilateral  agreement. In his opinion, it should be signed on the  international level, with the participation of countries which  have signed the Tehran, Yalta, and Potsdam treaties, thus  creating the present order in the post- war period.    DIENA was interested in learning if any of the  representatives of the national forces have visited the Skrunda  base, but we received no direct answer to this question.    Some time ago, while visiting Ludza, President Guntis  Ulmanis  also expressed a view supporting the idea of a referendum on the  question of the Skrunda radar base. However, Presidential Press  Assistant Anta Busa could not confirm to DIENA if the president  is of the same opinion now.    In accordance with Article 73 of the Constitution of the  Latvian Republic, agreements with other states are not to be put  to a popular vote. Minister of Justice Egils Levits confirmed  to DIENA that the question of Skrunda cannot be resolved by a  referendum.</p>

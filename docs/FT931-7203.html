			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / International Company News: World chip market 'to grow 17%' TEXAS Instruments expects the worldwide semiconductor market to grow 17 per cent to Dollars 70bn in 1993, up from about 10 per cent and Dollars 59.9bn in 1992, AP-DJ reports. The upturn will be spurred primarily by an improved US market and strong growth in the Asia-Pacific region, the company said. It estimates the US semiconductor market will grow at 25 per cent to Dollars 23bn, due primarily to strong demand for computers and communications products. For the first time since 1985, the North American semiconductor market will be larger than Japan's, the US company predicted. Japan will see market growth of 5 per cent in 1993, against a 7 per cent decline in 1992. Its semiconductor market is expected to reach Dollars 20.4bn.</p>

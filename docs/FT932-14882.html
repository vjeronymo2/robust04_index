			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / Management: Banking on satisfaction - How Lloyds is trying to improve service standards If you telephone a branch of Lloyds Bank and it rings five times before there is a reply; if the person who answers does not introduce him or herself by name during the conversation; if you are standing in a queue with more people in it than the number of open tills, then something is wrong. If any of these things happen, then the branch is breaching standards of customer service set by the bank since last July. The idea of a British bank having such mechanistic measures of customer service is far from traditional. Yet Lloyds feels it has little choice but to change its ways. As banks try to devise new charges to raise income from customers, they are confronted with increasing alienation. An internal survey at Lloyds found that while 73 per cent of bank customers were happy with their bank in 1987, the figure had dropped to 61 per cent by last year. This is a dangerous trend because many banks have invested in subsidiaries such as life insurance operations companies to try to sell more to their customers. 'It is a truism that you can only sell to a customer who is satisfied with the service he is getting,' says Clive Kenyon of Lloyds. Kenyon is trying to ensure customers are more satisfied with Lloyds than in the past. He is in charge of the 'service challenge', which was launched in the bank's 1,888 branches last summer after being tested in 55 branches in 1990. The initiative will be developed throughout this year. The reasoning behind it is simple. The bank hopes to raise the level of service by setting 'core' standards every branch must meet and supplementing them with local targets. These standards are being measured by a range of methods including customer surveys and staff questionnaires. Kenyon argues that Lloyds underestimated the impact of poor service before because it could not measure service as easily as the loan mistakes that appear as debt provisions in annual accounts. 'A bad loan is a very obvious cost, but a mistake in a pamphlet can be just as damaging,' he says. The emphasis on measurement means the bank's new standards are deliberately unexotic. Things such as the speed at which calls are answered can be quantified fairly easily. 'We just want to encourage polite, efficient service,' says Kenyon. The bank has tried to encourage participation from staff by allowing groups of employees working in teams in branches to set their own additional standards. 'They can choose, but it has to be something that has an impact on customers, not just watering the plants twice a day,' he says. Lloyds already has evidence of the impact. Customers were more satisfied with pilot branches in 1991 than with others. Furthermore, since the initiative was launched nationally in the summer, average satisfaction with branch service has risen five points on a 100-point scale to 81 points. The bank is monitoring the impact using four methods, two of which are customer surveys. There is a 'first impressions' survey of all new customers. There is also a general survey carried out every six months which seeks the views of a weighted sample of 350 customers per branch. The other two methods are more eclectic. A survey company telephones each branch anonymously twice a month to test how staff respond to inquiries about products. Finally, a quarter of each branch's staff answer a monthly questionnaire about the bank's products to test their knowledge. Kenyon says this is not intended to create competition among branches. But it is watching branches that underperform, helped by 24 managers who monitor the initiative. It is not only angry customers who are keeping Lloyds' staff under closer scrutiny than ever before.</p>

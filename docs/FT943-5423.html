			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / How To Spend It: Women seize control of their cleavages - Avril Groom on how modern bras can be used to flatten and flatter I recently met a man who claimed he could bestow a cleavage on even the most meagrely-endowed woman. He worked for a lingerie company and he was talking about bra design, which today seems to be a branch of structural engineering. Underwear that reflects, and even flatters, your real shape is no longer enough. Now you can be twice, or alternatively half, the woman you thought you were. That well-known company slogan about 'the bra for the way you are' needs rewriting. Now you are the way your bra is. The push-me-up, pull-you-in school of bra design achieves instantly - with Lycra and fine, flexible metal - far more natural illusions than those sought painfully and laboriously in the past with whalebone and binding. Throughout history, women have managed to alter and enhance their shape, mostly at the dictates of fashion. The difference now is that a woman can change her shape as often as her clothes. The cleavage-enhancing, underwired, padded bra that defines the decollete of an evening gown would look simply vulgar under a skinny cropped T-shirt. For this, all but the smallest need a minimiser which, in bra-speak, reduces the bust's projec-tion. The idea that a woman can change her shape implies that she has a large selection of bras, which is very good for business. Several bra companies report sales in the first half of this year up by 25 per cent over the same period last year, with sales of the type that make you look larger increasing fastest. You might expect the reverse, as women and their busts are getting bigger, due to the modern diet's higher protein content and, according to some theorists, the cumulative effect of the contraceptive pill taken by women whose mothers also took it. I have always regarded my unremarkable 34B figure as average and so it might have been 20 years ago. But now 36C is the norm and firms such as Berlei are producing bras with hitherto uncontemplated G cups - yet 30 years ago the DD cup was regarded as revolutionary. Men are noticeably uncomplaining about this trend, which perhaps explains the boom in Wonderbras, Ultrabras et al. It seems we are following the lead of the US, where women are bigger and men are glad of it. In the race for sexual selection big breasts, to put it bluntly, still count. Traditionally, the lingerie business itself has been dominated by men. This, quite rightly, is changing. Companies such as Gossard and Berlei now have predominantly female teams, even on the design and structure side. Yet fashion is firmly on the men's side. After three seasons of the waif, and the fragile bias-cut layers that go with her, the full-bosomed pulpeuse is back with a vengeance in her corset tops and hour-glass jackets. This was seen clearly on the catwalk, where it was demonstrated by hitherto string-bean supermodels who, overnight and mostly without the aid of implants, had developed swelling embonpoints, giving credence to my bra company friend's theory of cleavages. If they can do it, so can anybody. So I decided to test the bra business in two categories - minimisers under a clingy T-shirt, and augmenters under a soft, low-necked shirt. The results were varied, instructive and not always flattering. At least one in each section really worked, though it is a clever minimiser that does not put the unwanted 'extra' under your armpits. And augmenters really are built for the new average woman rather than me. Even with the best, to look like the girl on the packet, I still have to fold my arms and squeeze hard. Minimisers These are either specific projection-reducers or sports bra styles meant to give a smooth, flattering line under clingy clothes. Playtex Super Look Secrets Cotton Classic. Seamless, 32-36A, 32-38B and C, Pounds 15.99 from department stores. Lifts bust up and outwards. A smooth, natural line with a slight cleavage but a bit flimsy. Triumph Sport Tri-Action 3001, cotton jersey, front fastening, racing back. Sizes 32-38A, 32-44B-D, Pounds 14.50 from department stores. Flattens but points slightly downwards; a bit depressing. Very plain, good under see-through layers. Berlei Cascade Minimiser, nylon/elastane, sizes 34-42, C-E, from Pounds 13.99, from department stores. A serious supporter, heavily underwired for separation. Spreads bust outwards but augmented rather than reduced mine. Marks and Spencer Minimiser, polyamide / elastane, sizes 32-36D-E, 38C-E, 40C-DD Pounds 14. Spreads bust effectively but heavy underwire keeps under-arm line smooth. Lacy finish tricky under clingy clothes. Berlei Fitness Bra, nylon / cotton/elastane, sizes 32-38 B-D, Pounds 17.99 from Fenwick, New Bond Street, W1. Double-layer jersey crop top with subtle seaming, not cups. Pull-on, racing back. Very smooth outline, flattens well, but the larger bosomed would need more support. Hanro 1549, sizes 32A-38C, Pounds 21.50 from Fenwick; Harrods of Knightsbridge, SW1; Harvey Nichols of Knightsbridge, SW1; Dickins and Jones, Regent Street, W1; and Selfridges, Oxford Street, W1. Cotton jersey, underwired. Clever diagonal seam pushes bust outwards and underwire prevents downward turn. The greatest reduction and a flattering, youthful line. Augmenters Triumph Bijou, soft lace, sizes 32-38A-C, Pounds 17.99, from large stores. Underwired, removable pads. All up front; narrows the bust in and up. Playtex Wonderbra Balconette, sizes 32-36A, 32-38B and C. Pounds 14.99 from department stores, Hennes and Top Shop branches. Underwired, removable pads. Pushes up and out. Good with a low-cut evening dress but ledge effect on upper half of bust. Berlei Petite, nylon / viscose / cotton / elastane, sizes 30-36AA and B, 30-38A, Pounds 15.99 from department stores. Underwired, padded all over. Keeps natural shape but can look as if you have put on weight. An instant matronly bosom. Berlei Demi-Wire, nylon/ elastane lace, sizes 32-42B-D, 32-40DD-F, from Pounds 18.99, available in October. Semi-underwired following natural shape, soft lace. Very comfortable, gives you uplift but no increase in cleavage. Marks and Spencer Padded Plunge Bra, polyamide / polyester lace, sizes 32-36AA, 32-38A-B, 34-36C, Pounds 14. Padded all over. A natural outline that appears to be all your own. Extra padding supplied but ineffective. Lejaby, sizes 32-38, B-C, Pounds 37.95 from Fenwick. Underwired, padded undercup. Strangely pre-formed and produces an artificial line. Overpriced. Gossard Ultrabra, sizes 32-38A-C. Pounds 14.99 from Fenwick, Harrods, John Lewis and House of Fraser. Underwired, padded, removable extra padding. Instant Jessica Rabbit. Goes further, higher than any other with a surprisingly smooth outline and remains comfortable. Top marks.</p>

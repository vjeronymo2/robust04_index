			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Oleg Velichko] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 9 Feb -- Russian Economics Minister  Aleksandr Shokhin spoke out in support of pursuing a policy of  state regulation in the economy in a rational manner. At a news  conference that took place today he told journalists about the  expanded session of the collegium of the Ministry of Economics,  which has been held. At the collegium, new economic programs  were presented that had been drawn up by creative collectives  under the leadership of academician Stanislav Shatalin, Yevgeniy  Saburov, director of the Center of Information and Social  Technologies under the Russian Government, as well as the joint  program of Sergey Glazyev, chairman of the Committee for the  State Duma's Economic Policy, and Dmitriy Lvov, corresponding  member of the Russian Academy of Sciences. Shatalin's program  will moreover be presented to the deputies of the State Duma on  10 February.    Shokhin thinks that the government should pursue a policy of  state control over the prices of monopolists in some sectors of  industry. According to the minister, such monopolists as the  power generating engineers and the railmen have already started  to have an effect on the economy as a whole by raising  production tariffs. This is something that the government cannot  properly reconcile itself to. Besides this, Shokhin spoke out  in favor of reforms in society being socially oriented. In this  connection, he noted, some kind of alarm indicators should be  worked out that set the maximum admissible state of the economy  and, in particular, of the social sphere, the bounds of which  one should not overstep. Otherwise the government will lose its  control over the economy, he stressed.    Shokhin criticized a number of provisions presented in the  new economic programs. These were, for example, the striving to  freeze the ruble exchange rate, as well as Shatalin's proposal  that inflation should be lowered by freezing prices for three to  five months. However, Shokhin upheld the proposal that it was  necessary for the government to work out more stringent measures  for the making of payments and computations with regard to  producers.    Shokhin mentioned -- as one of the main results of today's  discussion -- the mutual desire of all those taking part to form  an authoritative commission that would collect the ideas of the  government and society's economic elite. The economics minister  thinks that quotas may be abolished in the second quarter. This  is explained, he added, by the fact that Russian prices are  already comparable with world prices in many cases.    Shatalin, who took part in the meeting, noted that people  were by no means unanimous on all points at the collegium.  Those taking part in the discussion, he noted, expressed  various points of view on such issues as the pursuing of a  social policy, a system of state price regulation, as well as a  tax policy.</p>

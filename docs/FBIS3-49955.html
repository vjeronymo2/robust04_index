			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Jozo Curic on the Belgrade-Zagreb </F> document signed on 19 January, including recorded remarks by  Croatian President Franjo Tudjman and FRY Foreign Minister  Vladislav Jovanovic]    [Excerpts] [Curic] The Belgrade Government and the Croatian  Government today signed a document on the peaceful resolution of  the crisis in Croatia. [passage omitted]    [Tudjman] This is the first step in the establishment of  normal diplomatic relations. One should recall that, for  instance, relations between the United States and China, after  they had been interrupted for many years, were established  precisely in such a way after Kissinger had visited Beijing, by  opening up such liaison offices.    This is a great step, I would say, of historical importance,  since this means the recognition of Croatia within its  internationally recognized borders. [passage omitted on Curic  speaking about the importance of the declaration]    [Tudjman] This means that public foundations have been laid  down for bringing to an end talks that we have been conducting  with the Serb population in Croatia, not only on a permanent  agreement on the cessation of hostilities, but also on the  reintegration of Croatia's territories that are currently under  UN protection in a normal way into Croatia's constitutional and  legal order. Obviously, this will take place gradually by  opening up roads and their reintegration into the economic,  legal, and social system of the Croatian state. [passage  omitted on Curic on other aspects of the agreement]    [Jovanovic] Turning our back on military methods represents  an important step forward in relation to the practice that has  hitherto prevailed. This is what is probably the most positive  thing in all this. By this declaration, this decision to  establish direct communication in the form of these bureaux,  offices, the two governments put their full weight behind peace  and the resolution of outstanding problems in a peaceful way.    An important problem remains to be solved: That is the  problem of Krajina, the UN Protected Areas, which is to be  resolved as envisaged by the Vance plan, through direct  negotiations between legitimate representatives of Serb Krajina  and representatives of the Croatian Government. Of course, we  can provide help in this, but we cannot, neither are we  authorized, to conduct these negotiations, or to prejudge a  final political solution in any way. [passage omitted: Curic  presents further details on the signing of the declaration]    [Curic] The Geneva conference, when it comes to peace in  Bosnia, has not produced any significant steps forward:    [Tudjman] Perhaps the conference has never before been as  dramatic as today. [passage omitted on Curic round-up of the  meetings today]    [Tudjman] It was obvious that some participants were in a  hurry to reach an agreement, while some others are likewise in a  hurry to continue the war. Even though all the sides have  stressed that they are in favor of ending the war, practically  there have been no results. [passage omitted]    [Tudjman] The important headway that we achieved in this  regard is that we agreed with the Muslims that talks on  contentious issues should be continued, while the most  contentious issue has remained their continued demands regarding  Neum and central Bosnia. We offered them a draft of our  bilateral agreement, they offered us theirs, but differences are  so big in this regard that this will probably be discussed when  the talks resume in Zagreb.    They surprised us with their rejection of 17.5 percent of  the  territory to be given to the Croats for the Croat republic of  Herceg-Bosna. They accept 33.3 percent in total with regard to  concessions that they received from the Serbs, but they are  putting forward fresh demands to the Serbs, which refers to some  towns; [Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister] Silajdzic even said  that he had heard about the 17.5 percent for the first time  today, although this conclusion was presented within the  conference and within the European Union.

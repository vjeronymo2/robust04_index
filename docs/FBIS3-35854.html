			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] [Hungarian] Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky,  who arrived in Ungvar [Uzhgorod, Ukraine] to hand over the aid  intended for the flood victims in Sub-Carpathia, had a  discussion with [Ukrainian Foreign Minister] Anatoliy Zlenko.  Peter Marvanyi, our special correspondent, reports from their  joint news conference in Ungvar:    [Marvanyi] Both countries will soon sign in Brussels the  document registering their joining the Partnership for Peace  program. This was said at the news briefing held after the  negotiations. [passage omitted]    Both politicians returned from the Balkans recently and  during their discussion it became clear that they agreed that  the conflict there must be solved by political means. Indeed,  Zlenko confirmed that Ukraine opposes any kind of external  interference. He said that a possible step of this kind by NATO  would have negative consequences for the entire Balkans.  According to the Ukrainian politician, nothing could justify  the bombing of Serbian positions.    Naturally, mention was made -- mainly appreciatively --  about  bilateral relations and the situation of the Hungarian minority  in Ukraine. Anatoliy Zlenko said that the harmony between the  minorities in Sub-Carpathia creates the conditions for cultural  autonomy. In his view, the situation of Hungarians living here  may be a yardstick for many countries where a solution to the  nationality issue is being sought.</p>

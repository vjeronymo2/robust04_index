Africa! Independence!    Distinguished guests, comrades, compatriots, friends,  members  of the High Command of APLA [Azanian People's Liberation Army].  On Wednesday when I spoke to you here I indicated that I would  not keep you long, but I regret to say that today I might be  longer. On the 25 January just after 10 o'clock that night I  had a long and heavy conversation on the telephone with Sabelo.  That was the last time I spoke to him. Today, on the 26  February and exactly one month after that happy telephone  conversation it is my painful duty to deliver the main oration  to Comrade Sabelo's funeral.    I have come to say goodbye Sabelo!    Painful because I have lost a comrade, a friend, a brother,  and a son, and painful because we are witnessing the passing of  yet another great son of our people who is following on the  heels of the great leaders such as Robert Mangaliso Sobukwe,  Nyati John Phokela, David Sibeko, Lekwane Zach Mothopeng, Jack  Masemula, and numerous others who have gone before. The loss of  Comrade Sabelo is a severe blow not only to the Pan-Africanist  Congress of Azania and to APLA [Azanian People's Liberation  Army], which led with such unparalleled distinction, but to the  broad liberation movement and suffering African masses as a  whole. We shall miss him deeply.    He will always be remembered by us!    There is no need to sing Comrade Sabelo's praises because  his  life, which he dedicated selflessly to the service of the  oppressed African people, is an open book which is there for all  to read. He led by example -- a true warrior and illustrious  leader in the noblest tradition of our forefathers. There is no  need to extol his commitment to the liberation of his motherland  and his people, indeed when death struck its cruel blow Sabelo  was on the road to yet another meeting which would have advanced  the course of our liberation struggle. His life was cut short  on a long and lonely road in Tanzania -- the African skies and  the African bush his only cover.    It is an indelible indictment of the racist apartheid  policies that such a gifted man, so loyal and African, so  dedicated a husband and father, so trustworthy a companion and  friend, should die far away from home, precisely because he had  been driven away from home and country by a burning desire to  rid his land of the scourge of racism and imperialism. It is a  cruel irony that Comrade Sabelo died at dawn of a new era on the  eve of elections for a constituent assembly in which he would  have taken his rightful place with other leaders of the  Pan-Africanist Congress [PAC], to shape and determine the  destiny of African people as desired by the African people  themselves.    If only we had the power to shape and determine our  destiny as we desire!    For Comrade Sabelo and for all our comrades in APLA, the  army  of the African people fighting for the genuine liberation of our  country from colonialism and racism, there was no alternative to  the violence of the regime but the response of the barrel of the  gun. Against our will we were forced into battle by the  political tyranny of apartheid and its violent and barbaric army  and police. We took a decision that a gun will be answered  with a gun! Yet, our position has always been quite  simple. If we are hit we hit back and we hit back hard.    Among us today are senior personnel of APLA. We salute them  and extend our deepest gratitude to them as true and dedicated  soldiers for the liberty of man from tyranny and oppression.  I will not forget that we still have a long way to  go!    Unlike the settler community and its elite reactionaries  drawn from the rank of the oppressed, we want to tell the world  in very clear terms that APLA is not a terrorist army. We want  to tell the world that Comrade Sabelo was not a terrorist. We  want to tell the world that Comrade Phama, even in death,  remains a true hero of our struggle. He gave his life for  the liberation of his people!    We want to tell the world that APLA is the army of the  oppressed African masses and every single one of them with us  here today and those still in the bush are our heroes, and we  also want to say this to the oppressors: APLA shall come back  in victory and no force on earth shall stop our march to  victory. We are determined to conquer shaka [referring to  the regime]!    Those who are searching for terrorists must take a closer  look at the murderers who are employed by the regime. The true  and only terrorists are in the CCB (Civil Cooperation Bureau],  in the hit squads of the SAP [South African Police], and the  foreign mercenaries of Koevoet [crowbar; police  counterinsurgency unit], and 32 Battalion. Those are the  terrorists.    Just three days before my last conversation with Comrade  Sabelo, the PAC announced a unilateral suspension of hostilities  against the regime. Comrade Sabelo and the entire top structure  of APLA unanimously endorsed the decision because we wanted to  show the world that we do not engage in violence for the sake of  violence. We wanted to isolate the true agents of violence, who  are the regime and its assorted gangs of murderers.    We were not forced by the regime or by anyone else to  suspend  the arms struggle. We did not sign any minutes and we did not  compromise any of our ideals and principles. We resisted all  attempts by the regime, both inside and outside the country ...  [break in transmission] ... to negotiate the future of the arms  struggle of the African people. The terrain of our struggle has  now shifted and we claim one major victory. We forced the  regime to give in on the question of an elected constituent  assembly and a new task has now begun.    In April we will fight the elections for a constituent  assembly based on the universal principle of one person one  vote. It is the constituent assembly where the African people  themselves will write a constitution acceptable to them, a  constitution for true liberation and freedom. Not half  liberation!    Our people inside and outside the country have endorsed  unreservedly our decision to fight the elections to enable us to  win a mandate from you to write a constitution which will set  you free in the land of your forefathers. We in the PAC believe  there are only two choices facing you at the elections. You  either elect parties which will form a new government, which  includes your oppressors and a new elite drawn from the ranks of  oppressed, or you elect the Pan-Africanist Congress of Azania.    The first choice shall never give you freedom but will only  perpetuate your subjugation while entrenching the privileges  which the minority enjoy at your expense. The second choice, an  overwhelming vote for the PAC, shall set you free. The PAC is  the only party in this country which has never compromised or  sold out on the sacred duty which the African people entrusted  to us. That sacred duty is the task of leading our people to  freedom. Last weekend in Khayelitsha, Cape Town, we unveiled  our election manifesto. Since then, and not surprisingly, there  has been numerous attempts by the regime and its (?affiliates)  to discredit our principles. They have tried everything  to discredit us!    The reason why we are being attacked is not hard to  understand. The regime and its surrogates are running scared.  They are running scared because they realize that the moment of  truth has finally arrived. They are running scared because they  realize the PAC has finally arrived. We have never made any  secret of our intention to reclaim our land from those who stole  it, but just in case the regime and its apologists did not hear  us clearly last weekend, let us repeat ourselves today. We are  going to get our land from you and we shall then hand it back to  its rightful and historical owners, the African people.  [applause] We will take back this land give it to its  owners, the Africans!    During their election campaign our ideological and political  opponents have made promises to pay the settlers for any land  taken back. We in the PAC make no such promises. The PAC shall  not pay anyone for our land and we make no apologies for that.  [applause] An overwhelming majority for the PAC at elections  will give you a constitution which shall enshrine the land as  your inalienable property because the land belongs to you. We  shall reclaim the land by constitutional means and Africans who  were forcibly removed from their land by apartheid and racism  will have the right to claim their land back.    In addition to land we promise you a caring economy, an  economy which will benefit every citizen of our country. Up to  now the minority has accumulated great wealth on the sweat of  our people, and under a PAC government that will stop. We shall  not nationalize institutions because it is not our policy to  create fat cats by transferring wealth from one class of elites  to new ones. Instead we shall democratize and socialize the  economy to benefit everyone, particularly the African masses who  are the major victims of poverty. In short our economic policy  will declare war on poverty, hunger, disease, unemployment, and  homelessness.    Under a PAC government our children shall go back to school  and we shall bring back the culture of learning. The  intimidation which has destroyed the careers of hundreds of  thousands of our children will stop. For far too long the class  boycotts have been spearheaded by hypocrites whose own children  have never been cannon fodder for the guns of the racist police  and we say that will now stop, and we promise you an end to the  violence wrecking our country. A government of the PAC will not  sit back and fold its arms and watch passively while Africans'  blood is spilt in violence, which serves the purposes of the  oppressors.    Too much precious African blood has been shed already and  one  more drop is one drop too many. Comrade Sabelo would not have  wanted us to achieve less for you. His life was dedicated to  improving the quality of life for the African people in a  liberated country. Our people inside and outside the country,  in APLA and all other structures of the PAC, demand that we go  out and win the elections in April so that the African people  can determine their own destiny.    In a final farewell to our fallen hero I have a message for  our young people. You all loved Comrade Sabelo in life and you  all drew inspiration from the noble and exemplary manner in  which he selflessly answered the call of duty. Take a leaf from  the life of a great man and true patriot. Whatever you do in  life, whatever your task in the name of our struggle for  liberation, do it diligently. Do it with honor and dignity. Do  it in the loving memory of your hero.    To our beloved sister and his widow, Comrade Dudu, and to  her  young sons Andile and Sandile, we give a message of courage and  strength. You are not alone in your grief in these trying times  of personal anguish. The whole nation of Africans is right  beside you and right behind you. Do not despair for the dawn of  liberation is near and when that day dawns we shall proudly and  jubilantly raise the flag of liberty on Comrade Sabelo's grave.    To his parents we give gratitude for having given him to the  noble task of liberating Africans. Few sons of the soil have  exerted themselves with such distinction. Sabelo's contribution  to the struggle for emancipation can never be measured or fully  explained in words. Indeed, when the true history of the  African people is written, the name of Sabelo Phama will be  etched in gold.    To the African nation we say: Go out and win elections  convincingly. Go out and win it for Sabelo Phama and ideas for  which he lived and died. Go out and win in memory of our fallen  hero so that he may take the good news of our victory to  Sobukwe, Phokela, and Mothopeng. And to all of our  heroes! Go out and win in the name of freedom and liberty.    As for all of us gathered here today over the noble bones of  our hero we rededicate ourselves even more diligently to the  attainment of the ideals for which Sabelo Phama lived and died.  We make this final pledge to our departed hero. We shall get  our land back and the African people shall be free.</p>

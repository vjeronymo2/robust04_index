			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / Sport: Alone on the ocean: the steeliness of the long-distance sailor - Sailing / Keith Wheatley on two very different men who are racing across the Atlantic TWELVE years ago Florence Arthaud was a freak. An exotically beautiful Frenchwoman, barely 21, competing in the solo transatlantic race. This was supposed to be the preserve of eccentric men with beards, backed by formidable war records. But time passes, and Florence, 35, is favourite to win the 1992 race at the helm of her blue-hulled trimaran Pierre 1er. The race started last Sunday. Wednesday's news that Philippe Poupon, current race record-holder with a Plymouth-Newport time of 10 days 9 hour, was retiring with boat damage leaves the field clear for Arthaud. She is presently gambling on being the most southerly of the leading multihulls. If the Atlantic headwinds back, that is swing to the south, a good each-way bet in midsummer, Pierre 1er could be in Newport by Wednesday. Boat technology has changed almost unimaginably since Sir Francis Chichester won in 40 days aboard the traditional sloop Gypsy Moth III, but the inner steel of sailors willing to drive almost without sleep or food towards a personal victory is a constant. Although the circus of media and minders surrounding Arthaud would baffle Sir Francis, you could put them on deck together and kindred spirits would emerge. This race has always acted as a magnet for mariners with a gleam in the eye - not to say a bee in the bonnet. Whose passion could run greater than Viktor Yasykov's, the first Russian ever to enter the race? Ever-smiling and almost unnaturally blonde for a man in his forties, Yasykov is a Red Army veteran who was ordered into Chernobyl to spend six months as a nuclear bin-man. Radiation sickness still afflicts him from time to time. Yasykov's self-designed and built 29ft boat Laguna took him three years to construct in his home town of Sochi, between Georgia and the Ukraine, on the Black Sea. Viktor's wife Ludmilla helped him sail it to Plymouth. Inside Laguna the chestnut planking, fastened with copper rivets, glistens in the light from an oil lamp. The craftsmanship would do credit to any yard in the world. Viktor cast the lead for the keel himself, fashioning the mast and boom from plain alloy tube. In halting but eager English he talks of reading about the single-handed race in Russia's first sailing magazine. 'It became my dream to build a yacht and take part in this,' he explained. From thought to deed was nearly 15 years. In between, the Fasizi entry in the 1989-90 Whitbread race came into his life. Viktor sailed two legs and the tragic skipper Alexei Gryshenko, who became so overwhelmed by pressure that he hanged himself in a Uruguayan wood, was his closest friend. 'My electronic log was built by Alexei. It reminds me,' explains the skipper proudly, pointing to a crude device that looks as if it came from an O-level physics project. In between preparing for six weeks alone at sea Alexei is fighting a battle with blinkered US immigration authorities who have declined to grant Ludmilla a visa to see him finish in Newport, Rhode Island. He has the passive confidence of a man who can hew and saw chestnut trees and build his own ark. From those with nothing, to those who appear to have everything, for the Atlantic encompasses them all. Nigel Burgess sells yachts for a living: the kind that have funnels, helicopters on the after-deck and cost Donald Trump Dollars 30m. Monaco-based Burgess, 47, has sold the Trump vessel three times. The quiet, bespectacled Englishman is arguably the most successful broker in his field. Burgess's idea of a holiday, however, is to race his spartan, ferociously fast monohull Dogwatch II across the Atlantic, preferably ahead of the opposition. 'If you want the ultimate sailing, this is pretty close. These boats are extremely fast yet relatively easy to manage,' said Burgess, whose office overlooks the first corner of the Monte Carlo grand prix circuit. In its first incarnation as Charente Maritime, the water- ballasted yacht came close to winning the Golden Globe solo round-the-world race. Unlike his French rivals Burgess has no sponsor - except his own company with the name painted discreetly on the stern. 'Someone came up to me the other day and said 'How did you get those flash boys to sponsor you?',' laughed Burgess. 'They couldn't connect this scruffy fellow, with holes in a old jersey, with Monaco and all that high-life stuff.' He did his first solo transatlantic race in 1968 when he was a 23-year-old junior officer in the merchant navy. He left after a decade, with a master's ticket. Burgess seeks contrasts when he goes to sea for fun. His professional life is all big ships, big deals. 'Sailing a boat this complex and powerful is a whole different game. You daren't sleep when you're close to the coast because you're going so fast,' he says. 'None of my boats have ever had engines. I'm not mechanically minded.' One of the other competitors remarked recently that this race, held every four years under the auspices of the Royal Western Yacht Club, 'is the last remaining mythical sailing event where amateurs are not regarded as strange creatures.' But isn't Burgess kidding himself that even an affluent amateur can take on the fully-sponsored French and Italian entries whose skippers sail full-time for a living? Back in France, Philippe Poupon and Florence Arthaud have the profile of a marine Nigel Mansell. 'I realise that they're fitter and in many ways better prepared than a sedentary middle-aged man who usually goes to work in a suit but they have their problems,' said Burgess. 'There is no better motivation than a passion. I'm not doing this as just another race on the circuit. And an average sponsor's pocket is no more open than my own.'</p>

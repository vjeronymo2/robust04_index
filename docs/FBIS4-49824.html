			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Wang Dongmei (3769 0392 2734): "Gu Jinchi, </F> secretary of the Liaoning Provincial CPC Committee, Conducts  Investigation and Study Activities in Rural Areas of Tieling  City"]    [Excerpts] From 26 to 27 April, Gu Jinchi, secretary of the  provincial party committee, conducted investigation and study  activities in the rural areas of Tieling city. After hearing  Changtu County's report on spring sowing and economic work, he  said that intensifying agriculture, being the foundation for  maintaining economic development and social stability, must not  be ignored in every minute. As a large agricultural county,  Changtu should always put grain production in the primary  position. Only when grain production is well developed will  forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupation, and fishery be  developed. To ensure an increase in grain production, we should  mainly maintain grain sowing areas, increase per unit area  yield, and achieve scientific farming. [passage omitted]    After talking about the facts that Changtu is a large  agricultural county but a small industrial county and that some  county-run industrial enterprises in the county are confronted  with difficulties, Gu Jinchi said: At the time of persistently  taking agriculture as the foundation, we must exert great  efforts to grasp industrial production and strive to enliven  state-owned enterprises. First, we should enable enterprise  leaders, staff members, and workers as well as responsible  departments to realistically strengthen the idea of markets.  This is a decisive factor for enterprises' development. It is  necessary to achieve the readjustment of the product mix and the  industrial structure according to market demands. Second, we  should have the idea of high efficiency. To develop industries,  we must stress efficiency. Each and every enterprise should have  profit and tax targets, strive to reduce production costs and  consumption, and try every possible means to increase the tax  rate levels. Third, we should select good cadres, select the  persons with managerial ability to run enterprises, link  responsibility with right and power, and have outstanding  skilled persons show their abilities and talents. [passage  omitted] Fourth, we should mobilize office cadres to go deep to  the grass roots, organize several inspection groups to help  enterprises solve their practical problems, attend to weak  links, and consolidate enterprises.    Gu Jinchi said: We should persist in the principle of taking  a two-hand approach and being sure that both hands are tough in  developing both agriculture and industry. It is necessary to  achieve both spiritual civilization and party building,  particularly the construction of leading bodies and leading  organs. The leading cadres at various levels and the personnel  of the leading organs should strictly be self-disciplined and do  their work in a cautious and conscientious manner. After  hearing the situation that the Changtu County grain bureau  simplifies the administrative structure, Gu Jinchi said: This  bureau has provided the organs across the province with  experiences in simplifying the administrative structure. At  present, some persons of some organs are busy day and night,  some drift along aimlessly, and some act as commentators and  indulge themselves in grumbling. Some units originally have to  serve the consumers. By changing this kind of service into  privilege, they always apportion expenses from those who ask  them to handle affairs. All this is related to overstaffed  organizations and bureaucracy. So, the administrative structure  should resolutely be simplified even if there are great  difficulties. The organs at various levels should maintain  administrative honesty and high efficiency, deal with concrete  work, and better serve the people. Tang Tiehan, secretary of the  Tieling city party committee; and Li Shiwen, mayor of the city,  accompanied Gu Jinchi to call on the family members of Bo  Renshi, a model town and township cadre and late secretary of  the party committee of Baoli Town of Changtu County.</p>

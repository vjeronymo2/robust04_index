			<p><P> August 31, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BILL TO APPOINT TRUSTEE TO RUN FINANCIAL AFFAIRS OF OAKLAND SCHOOLS OKD BY  PANEL  </P> <P> Unprecedented legislation authorizing appointment of a state trustee to  supervise the financial affairs of the beleaguered Oakland school district was  approved Wednesday by the state Senate Education Committee.  </P> <P> The state has appointed a few such trustees in the past but always at the  request of local school officials. In this case, if the legislation is approved  by the full Senate and signed into law by the governor, the state will impose a  trustee on the unwilling school district, to try to solve its fiscal problems.  </P> <P> 'They're going to go broke by next April and they don't have a plan to do  anything about it,' California Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig said in  an interview.  </P> <P> Under the bill, the Oakland school board is offered a $10-million state bailout  loan, if it agrees to accept a trustee that would serve until the loan is paid  off. But even if Oakland decides not to seek the loan, it would get the trustee  for at least 30 days, and perhaps for as long as three years, if Honig decides  that is necessary.  </P> <P> The 50,000-pupil school district faces at least a $2.6-million deficit in the  next year, despite laying off teachers and administrators and cutting back on  art, music and sports programs.  </P> <P> Kurt Sjoberg, acting state auditor general, said an investigation by his office  found that the deficit will climb to at least $16 million if the district  follows through on plans to build up reserves to pay for self-insurance,  asbestos abatement and other needs.  </P> <P> Half a dozen district employees and former employees have been arrested or  indicted in recent weeks on charges of misappropriating funds or stealing  school district property and more arrests are expected.  </P> <P> An Alameda County Grand Jury found 'gross mismanagement" in the district and  the state controller's office is investigating the possible misuse of more than  $5 million in state desegregation money.  </P> <P> The district has had no superintendent since last December, and two potential  successors have turned down the job. All of this prompted Assemblyman Elihu M.  Harris (D-Oakland) to propose legislation authorizing Honig to appoint a  'trustee-adviser" to supervise the district's finances for at least 30 days.  </P> <P> 'There is a time when the state has a responsibility to step in when things are  out of control," Harris told the committee, "and let me tell you, in Oakland  things are out of control."  </P> <P> Committee Chairman Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara) said the bill means "we are  going to step further than we've gone before" in terms of state control over  local districts. But Hart said it is a necessary step because "the Legislature  appropriates billions of dollars each year for schools and we have an  obligation to make sure the money is spent properly."  </P> <P> School board members, city officials and others from Oakland argued that  conditions in the Oakland schools are not as bad as Harris portrayed them and  that the district should be allowed to work out its own problems without state  interference.  </P> <P> "If we're going to be held accountable, let us do it our way," said school  board member Sylvester Hodges.  </P> <P> Hodges also said Harris introduced the bill only because he is "running for  mayor" of Oakland in November, 1990.  </P> <P> But the committee waved aside those objections and approved the bill by a 6-2  vote, sending it on to the Senate Appropriations Committee. It has already  passed the Assembly.  </P></p>

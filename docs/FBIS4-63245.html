			<p>BFN     [Text] The state of emergency may be introduced in Crimea  only by the Ukrainian parliament, head of the Ukrainian  president's internal-policy service Nikolay Mikhalchenko told  INTERFAX-UKRAINE.    He also said that "as the guarantor of the Ukrainian  Constitution, the president will act within the limits of his  powers."    He stated that the Crimean authorities had interpreted the  attempts to find a compromise and work constructively as a sign  of Ukraine's weakness.    "Today, we are responding, perhaps with a delay, to the  extremist moves by certain Crimean political quarters," he said.    He laid the responsibility for a possible conflict on the  central Crimean authorities who, he said, are pushing Crimea to  the conflict.    He also denied the reports about the landing of additional  Ukrainian forces in Crimea and about an attempted seizure of the  Crimean Interior Ministry.    "We did and do act in strict accordance with the  Constitution, but our patience may come to an end," he said.    On 20 May, the Crimean parliament intended to adopt a  resolution on restoring the Crimean Constitution adopted on 6  May 1992, which said that relations between Crimea and Ukraine  shall be regulated by agreements. Presently, Crimean-Ukrainian  relations are based on the Ukrainian law on the delimitation of  powers between the Ukrainian and Crimean authorities.</p>

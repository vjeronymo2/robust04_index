			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 1 KYODO -- The government, alarmed by  a host of plans to raise public utilities rates, plans to curb  such moves, government officials said Friday [1 April]. This  was decided at a ministerial meeting in response to a request by  Economic Planning Agency head Manae Kubota that rate hike moves  be screened carefully by the ministries concerned.    Kubota said rate hikes should be restrained particularly at  a  time when the domestic economy is showing signs of recovery,  adding that the government should lay down a "unified view"  regarding the range and timing of rate increases.    Construction Minister Kozo Igarashi urged the government to  make clear its stance on the matter, the officials said.    Local pay telephone call rates went up Friday along with  medical charges. Public housing, highway and subway  corporations have announced plans to raise charges in the near  future. An advisory panel to Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa  cautioned last week against indiscreet public utilities rate  hikes.  Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura told an afternoon  news conference that the government will study proposed hikes in  public utilities rates in line with the expected consumer price  rise of 1.5 percent for fiscal 1994.    "The government should make efforts to prevent easy rate  hikes from leading to the rise in overall consumer prices," the  top government spokesman added.    Takemura said the government will draw up, possibly next  week, a unified view on a host of plans to raise public  utilities rates.</p>

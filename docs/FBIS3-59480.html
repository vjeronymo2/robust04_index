			<p>Language: <F P=105> Albanian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Lumturie Ibraimi: "Trade Put to the Test -- the </F> Police in the Role of Customs Officers"]    [Excerpts] The embargo against Serbia is setting up  obstacles for Macedonian citizens who import various articles  from Turkey. A while back, there was a disagreement at the  Turkish border. The Turkish border organs would not allow  Macedonian citizens to export goods from Turkey, saying that  they would be going to Serbia, since they identified Macedonia  with Serbia. For 24 hours, the border guards held the Macedonian  citizens at the border, until they received an order from the  Turkish Government that they would be allowed to export. For  this reason and for many other reasons, importers of various  articles are experiencing many other difficulties, especially  with the Macedonian police who, after the border control, stop  the merchants and carry out unnecessary inspections, despite the  fact that they have all the necessary documents. We are  presenting the opinions of some merchants on this matter: Etem  Billali said: "The irregular status of Macedonia has caused us  serious problems with the Turkish border organs. Likewise, the  unnecessary inspection by the Macedonian police and the  mistreatment which we endure en route are just too much. We do  not get any better treatment at the Skopje customs office. The  customs fees are astronomical and they have no relation to the  purchase price of the articles. The customs fees force us to  increase the price of the articles." Musa Lamallari and Adnan  Aliu said: "To tell the truth, this is a hard job. The  mistreatment which we suffer until the goods reach the market  will cause us to abandon this activity and to seek some other  solution. The embargo against Serbia, which has a considerable  effect on us (the citizens of Macedonia), the fear of traveling  by night through Bulgaria, the mistreatment at the border and at  the Skopje customs office are enough to make us give up all of  this, which is the source of our existence." [passage omitted]    Extensive inspections by the police are also being carried  out in Bit Pazar. Persons who do not have the necessary  documentation for selling goods on the market have to undergo  these inspections. Bejtulla Bajrami told us that, a few months  ago, he had to turn over 1,300 pairs of socks, confiscated by  the police, although he had already paid the customs fees for  them. The matter went to court and the outcome is not known. The  general impression remains that the embargo against Serbia and  customs problems are two main obstacles to the normal  development of trade in Macedonia.</p>

			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / Observer: Lomax 'in transition' Just when we thought that Britain's brain drain was coming to an end, another high-flier jumps ship. Worse still, she is one of the few women economists to make any mark in the upper reaches of Her Majesty's male-dominated Treasury. Rachel Lomax, currently head of the cabinet's economic secretariat, is to take up a well-paid job at the World Bank. She is off to Washington in the new year to be a country director in Wilfrid Thalwitz's Europe and central Asia division, with responsibility for bank programmes in three 'economies in transition' - Romania, Bulgaria and Macedonia - as well as Portugal and Turkey. Lomax, 49, is not the first Treasury exile in Washington - John Odling Smee is the IMF's point man on Russia. But she will be a bigger loss to Whitehall where far too few women have made it into the upper ranks. The recent cuts in the size of the Treasury and the increasing power of the Bank of England may have had something to do with her decision. She'll be able to forget such trivia as VAT on fuel and turn her mind to a far more challenging task: the historic economic transformation under way in eastern Europe. Even so, for a woman who had been tipped as a future permanent secretary, it seems a surprise. So why is she moving? The World Bank has been struggling to boost its thin complement of senior female executives, so much so that its job advertisements now seek well-qualified 'women and men' in that order. Could Lomax, a former deputy chief economic adviser to the UK Treasury, be in the running to take over from Thalwitz.</p>

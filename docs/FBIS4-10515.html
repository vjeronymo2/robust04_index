			<p>BFN     [Text] Santiago, 11 Apr (EFE) -- Chile will lose $295  million per year if it does not establish some sort of  relationship with Mercosur [Common Market of the South],  according to a survey the Chilean Foreign Ministry asked a  private consulting firm to carry out. The firm recommended a  rapprochement with this group that seeks the integration of the  Southern Cone.    The survey results, published today by EL DIARIO, which  specializes in economic subjects, states that if Chile does not  establish some sort of relationship with Mercosur it "will lose  all the advantages to promote trade."    The survey states that Chile will lose $125 million per year  in exports and $170 million per year in imports.    The figures only reflect the impact of trade with Brazil and  Argentina, without taking into account Uruguay and Paraguay, the  other Mercosur member countries.    The survey states that "Mercosur is definitely important to  Chile," noting that its member countries are the main importers  of Chilean goods.    Moreover, it states that joining any integration initiative  will only speed up the flow of foreign investments, attracted by  the size of this broadened market, and also may contribute to a  greater complementation of the economies.    The report also refers to the negative effects that Chile's  possible link with Mercosur may have; the macroeconomic  instability of the member countries and their failure to agree  on a common external tariff, which would be a maximum of 11  percent of the current one in Chile.    According to the consulted analysts, the main problem in  reaching an agreement with Mercosur is in the establishment of a  common external tariff that the group must agree on and, within  this context, the true problem is that Brazil has higher taxes  for its capital goods, informatics, and electronics industry.    The report also states that if Chile joins Mercosur, it will  increase its exports to Brazil by only $2.5 million and its  imports of Brazilian goods, in turn, will increase by $71  million, of which 67 percent would represent a change in trade  partners not new deals.    In Argentina's case, it is quite the opposite because,  according to the survey ordered by the Foreign Ministry, exports  would increase by $58 million of which 68 percent would  represent new deals.    Imports, in turn, would increase by $100 million, of which  $67 million would represent new deals.</p>

			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / BCCI chiefs accused of tricking Baqi Mr Mohammed Baqi, the former managing director of Attock Oil charged with fraud over the collapse of Bank of Credit and Commerce International, has been made a scapegoat for the scandal, his defence counsel told the Old Bailey yesterday. In a closing speech, Mr Stephen Solley QC said Mr Baqi had been 'tricked and seduced' by senior BCCI officials into signing the audit confirmation reports (ACRs) that the prosecution claims were false and fraudulent. The prosecution alleges the ACRs signed by Mr Baqi were used to falsely inflate BCCI's profits by pretending the oil company owed the bank Dollars 90m (Pounds 61.6m). Mr Baqi denies 16 charges relating to the alleged furnishing of false information. Mr Solley said the prosecution claimed that Mr Baqi, with his commercial experience, should have challenged the veracity of what he was being asked to sign. However, others including staff from Price Waterhouse, the bank's auditors, and Bank of England supervisors had also failed to react properly to signs of fraud, Mr Solley said. 'Why is it that everyone at Price Waterhouse is innocent and everyone at the Bank of England is walking away from this because they were told this, that and another by Mr Swaleh Naqvi (the former BCCI chief executive), and Mr Baqi is being asked to justify signing an ACR?' he asked. The evidence that had emerged about the collapse of the bank 'stacked up more heavily' against Price Waterhouse than Mr Baqi, he said. Its staff had used second-best auditing practice in dealing with the ACRs, allowing them to take comfort from BCCI when they knew they should not. 'If Price Waterhouse had done things properly, the deepest part of the fraud could never have happened,' he said. The prosecution had also failed to appreciate how the Islamic culture of BCCI dictated how its business was conducted, he said. This ethnic background meant that had Mr Baqi questioned the veracity of what he was told by Mr Naqvi and other bank officials, it would have constituted a deep insult and affront to them. The trial continues today.</p>

			<p><P> February 13, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: KAHANE SPEAKS AT USC AFTER MONTHS OF DELAY  </P> <P> Militant Rabbi Meir Kahane finally got a chance to speak at USC on Monday, to a  group of about 65 people, while protesters outside compared him to Adolf Hitler  because of his controversial plan to expel Arabs from all Israeli-held  territories.  </P> <P> Kahane, the American-born leader of Israel's nationalistic Kach movement, had  first been scheduled to speak on campus last November.  </P> <P> But USC officials cancelled the visit, fearing his presence could incite  violence. He was invited to speak Monday after security arrangements were made.  </P> <P> Kahane's speech centered on an attack on "Jewish liberals" who believe that  Jews and Arabs can coexist in the Middle East. But the former Israeli Knesset  member told his audience in Hancock Auditorium that he was not a racist,  adding: "Racism states that any group or people are permanently inferior to  mine. I say that any Arab who wishes to become Jewish can become Jewish."  </P></p>

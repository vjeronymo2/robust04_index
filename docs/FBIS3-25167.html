Ntaryamira kept a promise to draw his government from both  his own party the Front for Democracy in Burundi (FRODEBU) and  the main opposition Party of Unity and National Progress  (UPRONA), a government source said.    The source said that the 60 percent of government seats  would  go to the FRODEBU and the rest would be made up of the UPRONA.    Ntaryamira, a member of the majority Hutu tribe, was elected  president after the murder of former president Melchior Ndadaye,  the country's first Hutu leader.    His murder in a failed coup bid on October 21 unleashed a  tide of tribal violence between the Hutu and Tusi tribes, which  left an estimated 100,000 people dead and caused another 700,000  to flee.</p>

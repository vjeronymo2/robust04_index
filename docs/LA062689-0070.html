			<p><P> June 26, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP REVIEWS;  </P> <P> SOLO T BONE BURNETT SINGS, SPARS AT MCCABE'S  </P> <P> Performing in the put-up-or-shut-up framework of a solo acoustic showcase on  Friday at McCabe's, singer/guitarist T Bone Burnett proved himself as humorous  as devil worship and as serious as nuclear waste. The long tall Texan opened  the first of two shows with his best, i.e., least affected song, "River of  Love," and closed the 90-minute set by walking out onto Pico Boulevard to  serenade the waiting late-show crowd with a campfire sing-along of "Kumbaya."  </P> <P> In between, Burnett played pop, country, blues, and rock, ranging from the  marks-his-Lennonisms of "Killer Moon" to two deja-vu versions of the standard  "Where or When." A superb raconteur, Burnett sparred good-naturedly with the  too-adoring crowd ("Don't underestimate us!" "Don't underestimate me" was one  memorable exchange.) In a more subtle illumination of talent, Burnett  (currently most successful as a producer of Los Lobos, Elvis Costello, et al.)  displayed a casual mastery of the art of accompanying oneself on guitar. Always  a pleasure to see a small room suck 'n' spit the excess artifice out of an  artiste. DON WALLER  </P></p>

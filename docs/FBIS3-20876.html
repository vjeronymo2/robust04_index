			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article under the rubric "People": "Bogdan </F> Pek"]    [Text] In comparing the sale of the Bank Slaski shares with  the FOZZ (Fund for Servicing the Foreign Debt) affair, Bogdan  Pek, a Sejm deputy representing the PSL (Polish Peasant Party,  one of the coalition partners), set in motion a whole set of  political and economic events: The discussion he started on the  workings of the Polish stock exchange was one of the reasons for  the fall in the share price, while Prime Minister Waldemar  Pawlak dismissed Stefan Kawalec from his position as deputy  minister of finance, thereby getting rid of his main opponent to  the proposition of supporting the BGZ (Food Industry Bank) with  the better part of the funds set aside in the budget for aiding  the banks.    Bogdan Pek accused the bureaucrats in the Ministry of  Finance  of a rather large mistake in fixing the price of the Bank Slaski  shares, adding that it was not they but rather the exchange and  the economic condition of the enterprise that should have  decided on the share price. In his opinion, the state budget was  the loser in the privatization of Bank Slaski, while bank  employees profited in availing themselves of "unjustified"  preferences. In general, they cleared 5.8 trillion zlotys [Z];  management representatives profited by nearly Z15 billion.    Bogdan Pek was born in 1953 in Krakow. He completed the  Zootechnical Department of the Academy of Agriculture. He is a  professional politician: Active in the PSK [expansion unknown],  he became a member of the Board of Directors and president of  the Krakow branch of the party. In last year's parliamentary  elections, he received 8,188 votes and, for the first time in  his career, won a seat in parliament. In the Sejm, he serves as  chairman of the Commission on Ownership Transformations [aka  Privatization].    He is married and has a 9-year-old daughter and an  18-year-old son, who, he asserts, "would have priced the Bank  Slaski shares better on his own calculator." His hobby is  fishing.</p>

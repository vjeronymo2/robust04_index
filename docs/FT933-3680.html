			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / Poll lead widens for Norwegian Labour party AN opinion poll published yesterday showed support for the ruling Labour party holding steady at 34.8 per cent, while the main opposition Conservative party weakened to 18.1 per cent from 22.2 in the 1989 general election, Karen Fossli reports from Oslo. Analysts say the importance of the Conservative party's strong defence platform has dimmed in the eyes of an electorate no longer preoccupied with defence and security issues. The anti-EC agrarian Centre party polled 16.1 per cent against a 6.5 per cent vote in 1989. One of the most striking features of the poll is the plunge in support to 6.6 per cent for the populist right-wing Progress party, from 13 per cent.</p>

			<p><P> August 6, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> CLAY'S EX: HE USED TO BE NICE  </P> <P> Even though Kathy Swanson is suing Andrew Dice Clay for $6 million, she wants  people to know the comedian who once was her husband used to be sweet.  </P> <P> Swanson, who left her family's rural Iowa farm to seek success in Hollywood,  said she and Clay met in 1980.  </P> <P> Their first date included buying a bottle of wine at a convenience store and  sitting in front of a fake log in his fireplace.  </P> <P> They spent a chaste night together on the sofa, sleeping, she said.  </P> <P> "It was like he tied me to a pedestal. He was very protective of me, and that  was fine at the time," Swanson said in an interview with the Des Moines Sunday  Register.  </P> <P> They lived together for four years, married in 1984 and were divorced two years  later.  </P> <P> Although her ex-husband -- whose act has been criticized as misogynist,  homophobic and otherwise bigoted -- always tended to view women "as barefoot,  pregnant and walking 10 feet behind you," she said, his barbs grew more  vehement.  </P> <P> Swanson said that Clay manipulated her and that she did not get her own lawyer  when they divorced. Her lawyer now, Marvin Mitchelson, said the divorce decree  settled $4,000 in debts and paid Swanson $1,000 a month for 18 months.  </P> <P> Her suit seeks $3 million in shared property and an equal amount in punitive  damages.  </P> <P> Clay's lawyers have declined to comment.  </P></p>

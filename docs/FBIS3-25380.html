			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] General Eduardo da Silva Nihia, first secretary of  the Mozambique Liberation Front [Frelimo] Party in Nampula, has  accused the Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] of trying,  through obscure methods, to find a pretext to resume war in  Mozambique. Reacting today to the latest accusations by  Renamo's Lieutenant General Mateus Ngonhamo, Nihia told  journalists that he has never been involved in any plan to give  military training to 1,000 men and 350 riot policemen in a  training camp on the outskirts of the city of Nampula.    The supreme Frelimo leader in Nampula Province asked how it  would be possible to secretly train 350 men in a big and densely  populated city like Nampula. Gen. Nihia explained to  journalists that the so-called Poligono-2, where troops and a  riot police force are allegedly being trained, is being used as  a transit point for government troops moving to assembly areas  of Namialo and Angoche. He said the area is also being used by  Bangladesh troops in the UN Operations in Mozambique [Unomoz]  for their physical exercise.    [Begin Nihia recording] Well, I can say that the truth is  there are no men being trained there. The men who are there are  waiting to be moved to assembly areas in Namialo and Angoche. I  do not know why Mr. Ngonhamo is inventing these accusations,  citing my name. Since I was posted as the first secretary of the  Frelimo Party in Nampula, I have never visited a single military  unit. In Nampula I travel alone. I am never escorted. In all  districts I have never been escorted. I move alone because I  believe in the peace accord. I believe in the end of war. [end  recording]    In view of what he described as inventions, the first  secretary of the Frelimo Party in Nampula then said and I quote,  Lt. Gen. Mateus Ngonhamo is not the reasonable person I thought  he was, unquote. The Frelimo Party official in Nampula Province  said ironically that the Maringue Military Academy, where  Ngonhamo was trained, teaches its cadets subjects like lies,  arrogance, and terrorism. We asked Nihia whether he would take  legal action against Lt. Gen. Ngonhamo.    [Begin Nihia recording] It may go that far. If people are  not careful, things may go that far. Gen. Ngonhamo is a citizen  and in his capacity as a citizen he should not make false  charges against a free citizen, as I am. It may go that far, if  he continues with these accusations and he does not present  concrete reasons. He will not be able to present reasons for me  to say yes, it is true. What I am saying is what I mean. [end  recording]    Asked to explain why he changed his impression of Gen.  Ngonhamo, Eduardo da Silva Nihia said power has spoiled the  Renamo officer who is today in the High Command of the future  unified army.    [Begin Nihia recording] Ngonhamo was recently appointed as a  member of the High Command of the future nonpartisan forces in  the country [words indistinct]. Before being appointed, he  [words indistinct]. Now that he has been appointed to that  post, he thinks that he has power [words indistinct]. [end  recording]    Gen. Eduardo da Silva Nihia doubted whether Ngonhamo has the  capacity to become lieutenant general. He said it is not his  desire to join the new army to consist of soldiers from the  government and Renamo, but if this happens, he would not [words  indistinct] be commanded by Ngonhamo, as long as he demonstrates  that he is responsible and honest in his command.</p>

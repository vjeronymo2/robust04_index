			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / International Company News: Redundancy payouts affect Caltex results Caltex Australia, which is part of the Texas-based Caltex group although quoted separately on the Australian Stock Exchange, announced a 44.3 per cent fall in first-half profits, to end-June. After-tax profits were ADollars 19.8m, (USDollars 14.5m), on sales of ADollars 1.66bn, compared with ADollars 35.5m on revenues of ADollars 1.71bn a year ago. The most recent six-month figure was reached after a Dollars 10.5m abnormal item. There were no abnormal charges in the previous year, but the figures benefited from a ADollars 6.37m tax adjustment gain. Earnings per share were 10.98 cents, compared with 19.71 cents previously. Caltex, which operates more than 1,000 service stations, said that the abnormal charge related to redundancy costs at its Kurnell refineries, which would be recovered in two years. It added that competition in the Australian retail petrol market had intensified 'dramatically' in the first quarter of the year, and that market growth in 1994 had been 'basically flat' for petrol, with diesel fuels expanding 3 per cent.</p>

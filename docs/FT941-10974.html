			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / Company News (This Week): Chemicals still a source of anxiety as profits rise - British Petroleum British Petroleum will be the first of the big European integrated oil companies to report final results for 1993 when it releases its fourth-quarter figures on Thursday. Analysts expect after-tax profits from the final quarter of about Pounds 290m - up from Pounds 200m - on a replacement cost basis, which strips out the losses and gains from stockholding. But the company could also take a Pounds 200m exceptional charge for restructuring its troubled European chemicals division. No new chemical plant closures are expected, but a rationalisation of product lines is likely. Mr David Simon, chief executive, has made no secret of his frustration at the lack of progress being made by the European petrochemicals industry in cutting its chronic over-capacity. On the upstream oil and gas side of the business, analysts expect BP to continue to report success in cost-cutting. That was one of the main factors underpinning the performance of most of the oil majors in the second half of the year. Weak oil prices have so far not affected the viability of any big development projects, although the company has curtailed some drilling activity and squeezed suppliers to reduce capital costs. The benchmark Brent Blend regained some ground last week, but prices of Dollars 14-Dollars 15 a barrel are still about Dollars 4 down on last year. Analysts will be keen to ask BP if marketing margins held up during the fourth quarter. The three biggest US oil groups - Exxon, Mobil and Chevron - have reported sharply higher refining and marketing earnings for the last three months of 1993, helping to offset the effects of the fall in oil prices. For the year, BP's after-tax profits, excluding exceptionals, are forecast to have doubled to roughly Pounds 1.1bn on a replacement cost basis.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Colonel Vladimir Martynenko, candidate of </F> economics and chairman of the Military-Economic Society, and  Lieutenant Colonel Ivan Ivanyuk: "Traditions and Today:  Military-Economic Societies: What We Can Expect From Them"]    [Text] It is no exaggeration to say that 1993 was a year of  disappointment for servicemen in a material sense. And not  because incomes did not grow as one would have liked and as had  been promised, that military pay was held up for months, and  many benefits provided by legislation were frozen. Something  else became clear as well: Given the financial crisis, none of  the declared priorities of supporting the Armed Forces are going  to be met. The situation cannot be relieved by threatening  orders from above, bold red inscriptions on financial and  economic documents, or other administrative-command methods. As  a result, beginning in the second quarter of last year, the Army  and Navy began to suffer shortages of the most essential  items--fuels and food. And those who entrusted the solution of  their problems to all manner of funds created to provide social  protection to servicemen were bitterly disappointed. The money  had gone down the drain, as they say, and with it their faith in  any nongovernmental initiatives in this area. The question must  now be posed in the following terms: Will the Russian Armed  Forces survive under market economy conditions or not?    The market system, as we know, has existed for more than a  few decades. It would be strange to think that the world has not  yet devised mechanisms to help servicemen adapt to its harsh  terms and specific rules. One such mechanism is the creation of  military-economic societies. Their prototype arose in Holland  back in 1819. The Equipment Capital enabled officers to obtain  equipment and supplies of the highest quality at modest prices.    Late in the last century, military-economic societies began  being created in many of the world's countries -- Germany,  France, Japan, Portugal, Spain. In Russia, the charter of the  first consumers union for St. Petersburg sailors, known as  Thrift, was confirmed in 1880. The Economic Society of Guards  Corps Officers arose in 1891 and was the largest up to that  time. By 1915 such societies were functioning in the Kiev,  Odessa, Kazan, and Moscow military districts and in many large  garrisons. They provided their members with discounts on goods  and services of up to eight percent off average prices. They did  so by opening their own stores, warehouses, and repair shops and  by concluding contracts with trading firms, book publishers and  others companies under which society members received discounts  and benefits. Some military-economic societies created mutual  aid associations that supported the families of those who had  perished or died of war injuries.    The next stage in the development of the military-economic  movement was the emergence of associations whose aim was to  develop military sciences, equipment, and industry. The best  known of them was an engineer officers group that was  subsequently known as the Military Personnel Society and later  the Military Science Enthusiasts Society.    All the societies consisted of subscribers (for one-year  periods or for life). In some places officers had share-holder  rights. One could also point out that in 1894 all men of the  czar's family -- 14 people in all -- were members of the  Economic Society of Guards Corps Officers.    Members and life-long subscribers received dividends from  profits based on the shares they owned and enjoyed a cash  premium in proportion to purchases made in the society. The  latter benefit was also enjoyed by one-year subscribers. Many  societies had a very large cash turnover. For example, the  Guards Economic Society increased its turnover from 10.5 million  rubles to 1899 to 23 million rubles in 1908. Three-quarters of  this money came from trade and cash and securities transactions.    How was initial capital acquired? From society members'  shares and contributions, subscriber fees, loans and credits,  profits from the societies' own activities, from interest earned  on securities, deposits, and loans, and from voluntary  contributions. It should be pointed out that considerable sums  of money from centralized sources, as we would say today, were  appropriated to support their activities. For example, the czar  built several buildings, including the current Central Military  Department Store, and donated them to the Moscow  Military-Economic Society.    Other facts also attest to the attention the state devoted  to  these structures. For example, the fact that military-economic  societies were created with the consent and agreement of the  government. The charters of all societies were approved by the  defense minister or by one of his deputies. The defense minister  was to be notified whenever a society ceased operations, after  which an appropriate order was issued in the district concerned.    And now it can be said that a revival of military-economic  societies has finally begun in Russia. One such structure arose  last year, thanks to the efforts of military and civilian  economists, political scientists, and legal specialists; it was  registered with the Russian Ministry of Justice on March 22 as  the Military-Economic Society. This was followed by the creation  of the Russian Economic Society of Reservists. The  organizations' main goals and tasks have to do mainly with  pooling the efforts of reserve servicemen and officers to  protect their interests in the privatization process, improving  their living conditions, promoting the country's economic  recovery, and increasing the effectiveness of military reform  and the conversion of military production. More than 50 regional  organizations have been created in the past three months, just  recently by the Air Defense Forces reserve officers at Sergiyev  Posad, and preparations are being made for a founding conference  at the Plesetsk space facility.    Acquiring initial working capital is a serious problem for  officer economic societies. For such large regional centers as  Saratov-Conversion, which has an annual turnover of almost a  billion rubles, that stage is already past. That society's  members have found mutually advantageous forms of cooperation  with local government agencies and with dozens of enterprises in  neighboring oblasts, proposing modern technologies, deliveries  on favorable terms, and interesting projects. Others are only  just forming their operating capital. Membership dues, as a  rule, range from the cost of a monthly food ration to 100,000  rubles. Some use monies from mutual aid funds. And officers at  an aviation garrison in Tver Oblast contributed a million rubles  each from the retirement benefits they received upon discharge.    What are the resulting benefits for servicemen, workers,  office employees, and those who have already been discharged  into the reserves? Society members can buy consumer goods and  food products at prices just seven to 10 percent above  enterprises' release prices, while prices are marked up 29  percent for those who have not bought shares. That is still  cheaper than in military stores, which have to maintain sizable  staffs, warehouses, and other facilities and which in some areas  have set prices that are even higher than those in commercial  stores. Military-economic societies that have direct ties with  suppliers pay only for the labor of the reserve officers and  family members of the servicemen directly involved in the work.  The new structures are not in a position to supplant military  trade at the current stage, but they can already stimulate  healthy competition in providing trade services to garrisons.    The Russian Economic Society of Reservists already has land  allocations in a number of parts of the country, has concluded  agreements with leading construction and design organizations,  and is prepared to start building apartments for reserve  officers. Several multi-unit apartment buildings are now ready  for tenants. The apartment prices will be 10 to 12 percent below  the Defense Ministry's cost, and oversight will be more  reliable, since the society members who lack apartments have an  interest in this. The next move is up to the government, which  has promised to appropriate sizable amounts of money to local  administrations for this purpose; it will be important to ensure  that the funds are not wasted the way they were last year.    Military-economic societies have also asked the government  to  eliminate the unequal situation of servicemen vis-a-vis labor  collective members in voucher privatization. The gist of their  proposals is that reserve servicemen and officers be allowed to  buy surplus Defense Ministry property and real estate at 1991  prices and that reserve officer economic societies be allowed to  operate as (confidential) trusts or lease on favorable terms  various repair enterprises, shops, and workshops, as well as to  lease equipment and other materials.    The Russian Federation State Committee for Geology and the  Use of Mineral Resources, in conjunction with the  Military-Economic Society, is currently devising programs to  reclaim lands vacated by the Armed Forces and to use them as  farmland.    There is no question that many of these efforts could be  slowed or blocked if military-economic societies fail to receive  psychological and material support from the government and the  Defense Ministry. One would like to believe that this won't  happen, that the more than 150-year experience of similar  organizations in many European countries will be taken into  account (societies are currently operating successfully in  Germany, Italy, Turkey, and other countries) and that the basis  already established in our country will be revived in a new  form. But this does not mean leaving people to deal with their  problems on their own; we must simply foster conditions that  will make it possible to use the enormous potential of  servicemen, and above all reservists, in efforts to solve the  most urgent social problems.</p>

			<p><P> January 25, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PROPOSAL MAPS OUT SYSTEM OF TRAILS  </P> <P> Rancho Palos Verdes City Council members on Monday approved a plan that maps  out a comprehensive network of pedestrian, equestrian and bicycle trails for  the city.  </P> <P> The plan, which deals with existing as well as proposed trails, was developed  over a two-year span by a citizens committee appointed by council members. It  now goes to city officials, who will determine how to implement it.  </P> <P> The city and the peninsula have lost trails through the years because of  development, said Barbara Dye, who chaired the committee. "This really protects  us from losing trails inadvertently."  </P></p>

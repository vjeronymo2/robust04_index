			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Overseas buying drives shares ahead THE renewed strength of stock markets across Europe, emphasised in the UK by hopes of an early cut in domestic interest rates, took the London stock market yesterday to within a few points of the all-time high on the FT-SE Index. The dramatic events in Russia, reflected in calmer oil and currency markets, set the scene for confident buying of equities. US and continental European funds bought into the UK market, often by way of the December contract on the Footsie which continued to trade at a strong premium. Trading volume in equities, as reported by the day's catch-all Seaq total, was the highest since mid-August. Shares opened higher and extended their gains as stock index futures raced ahead. At best, the Footsie was nearly 29 points ahead at 3,096.4, barely five points under the closing all-time high. The pace then slackened, but the FT-SE closing level of 3,085.2 was 17.5 points up on the day. At the end of August, the Footsie traded, but did not close, around 3,115. The enthusiasm spread across the range of the market, lifting the FT-SE Mid 250 Index by 18.4 to 3,457.7. Seaq volume jumped by 40 per cent from Monday to a total of 774.3m shares, with non-Footsie business contributing around 62 per cent. Monday's retail business was worth Pounds 1.01bn, sustaining the twelve month long record of profitable trading in equities in the London market. Renewed buying of UK stocks by fund managers from across the Atlantic provided a significant boost to confidence as well as to share prices. Salomon Brothers International, the US investment bank which turned positive on London this week, was believed to be a buyer yesterday of both equities and stock index futures. At Nomura Research Institute, Mr Nicholas Knight, the noted bull of the UK market, repeated his forecast that the Footsie will close the year around 3,500, although adding that to concentrate unduly on December 31 is to 'miss the essence of any forecast.' Hopes for a cut in UK base rates are focused around the annual conference of Britain's Conservative party, now in session in Blackpool, and in particular on tomorrow's speech by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor of the exchequer. However, there was not much activity in UK fixed interest stocks yesterday and few City analysts expect base rates to be cut immediately. With crude oil prices no longer responding to tensions in Russia or to last week's Opec agreement, the blue chip oil stocks lagged the stock market. Pharmaceutical stocks improved with the general trend but were not the favoured stocks of the US buyers. Domestic consumer and banking stocks, however, were in good form as the market regained its confidence in prospects for a cut in base rates. Banks' burdens of bad debt would be eased if rates were cut. Across the broader range of the stock market, expectations that the recovery in the UK economy will soon show itself in corporate profits appeared undimmed by the slightly disappointing outcome of the third quarter profits reporting season which has just ended. Optimism has been moved forward to cover prospects for the fourth quarter season which opens early in January.</p>

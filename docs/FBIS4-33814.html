			<p>BFN     [Text] Airlines in Port-au-Prince are awaiting the decision  on suspending passenger flights. The airline association  president has said it will be business as usual while airlines  wait to hear about the measure.    Frantz Desvarieux explains that the suspension of commercial  flights could have some serious consequences for the airlines.  Desvarieux, who manages Haiti Trans-Air, in Port-au-Prince, said  his company would be particularly crushed if air traffic were  suspended.    Correspondent Rothschild Francois reports:    [Begin recording, in Creole] [Desvarieux] It is a problem  for  the airline companies. The route is economically important to  those companies that use it. It is the only route that Haiti  Trans-Air uses. We would have to close. It would be  economically disastrous. About 200 more people would be added to  the country's unemployment list. It will be very difficult for  we are a small company.    [Francois] Vacation time is a good time for the airlines...    [Desvarieux, interrupting] Generally speaking, this is the  season. Summer is economically the best season for us. The  same thing happened with the guys exporting mangoes. This is  the mango season. They lost it. This is a consequence of what  is happening in the country.    [Francois] Did you receive any notice from foreign companies  telling you not to make reservations for July or September?    [Desvarieux] No. The regulations office did not give us any  notice. These stories are out of the question right now.    [Francois] Asked about the restrictions Haitian passengers  must face when traveling to the United States because of the  embargo, Desvarieux said he recognized that the situation is  getting difficult for the passengers who used to carry a certain  amount of luggage, especially on their return to Haiti.    [Desvarieux] The passenger traveling from Port-au-Prince to  Miami is only allowed to bring personal belongings on board. No  commercial items are allowed. It used to be that you could  bring certain products -- such as rum -- worth up to $100 with  you without paying taxes. This is no longer allowed.  Passengers are allowed to bring food on the return flight from  the United States. U.S. customs sometimes checks for commercial  goods and then seizes them.    We recommend that passengers carry personal belongings and  whatever is allowed. Passengers should not bring large amounts  of commercial-looking items. They will have difficulties.

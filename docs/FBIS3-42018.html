The president acts consistently in the  spirit of the resolution, passed by the country's Supreme  Council, on Ukrainian ratification of the well-known treaty on  the destiny of the nuclear weapons on its territory, the head of  Kravchuk's press service pointed out.    The occasion for the conversation at 0930, during which a  real official statement was made, was the coming visit to  Ukraine today of U.S. President Bill Clinton for a meeting with  Kravchuk. The head of Kravchuk's press service said Clinton's  arrival from Prague was expected here this evening at 1900 and  his stay would last about two and a half hours. The Kiev  dialogue would center on fundamental questions for the signing  in Moscow, currently in preparation, of the trilateral treaty on  nuclear weapons.</p>

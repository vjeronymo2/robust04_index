			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Further, the design of the thrust reverser control system is such that there is a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> constant supply of pneumatic signal air to the DCV. When the thrust levers are in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``idle'' or ``forward thrust'' position, air flows through the DCV to the stow port of the gear  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> switching actuator. Signal air leakage from the stow chamber to the deploy chamber  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occurs even with an actuator that is within overhaul limits. The signal air that leaks into  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the deploy chamber is designed to be vented through the actuator deploy port and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deploy signal line to the DCV, where it exits through the DCV vent. If this vent path  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> becomes plugged, the pressure in the deploy chamber will rise. Pressurization of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deploy chamber of the gear switching actuator can cause the gear switching actuator to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> move to the ``deploy'' position.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, drive air is supplied to the thrust reverser Pneumatic Drive Unit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (PDU) through a Pressure Regulator Shut-off Valve (PRSOV). The PRSOV opens when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it receives pneumatic signal air from the DCV. This signal is received whenever the thrust  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> levers are moved to the idle position, either in flight or on the ground. If the DCV vent,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deploy signal line, or gear switcher actuator deploy chamber port becomes plugged and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> causes the gear switcher actuator to move to the ``deploy'' position, the thrust reverser will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deploy when the thrust lever is moved to the ``idle'' position. Plugging of this vent path  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has caused approximately 30 (of 31) known events of in-flight deployment of the thrust  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reversers on Model 747 airplanes. Such plugging has been caused by improper  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deactivation procedures, pieces of air filter media, and ice formed during flight.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The installation of the solenoid-operated shut-off valve required by this AD will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prevent the flow of pneumatic drive air to the PDU, unless the airplane is on the ground  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the reverse thrust levers are in the ``reverse thrust'' position. The shut-off valve is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> installed between the PRSOV and the thrust reverser PDU. The shut-off valve opens only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> when the airplane air/ground logic is in the ground mode and ``reverse thrust'' is selected.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, the shut-off valve is designed to prevent in-flight deployment of the thrust  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reverser by preventing the flow of drive air to the PDU (unless the airplane is on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ground and ``reverse thrust'' is selected).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There has been only one reported in-flight deployment of a thrust reverser on a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Model 747 involving an engine that was equipped with the solenoid-operated shut-off  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> valve. However, this incident was determined to have been caused by a maintenance crew  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that disconnected the PDU drive shafts to the thrust reverser in order to deactivate the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> thrust reverser, and inadvertently did not lock the reverser sleeve. By disconnecting the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> two drive shafts, the two reverser locking devices were disconnected. Thus, the improper  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deactivation of the reverser contributed to the in-flight deployment incident. By  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disconnecting the PDU drive shafts, the pneumatic drive was taken out of the system;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> therefore, the shut-off valve had no effect on the deployment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> None of the other 30 incidents of in-flight deployments of the thrust reversers on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Model 747's have occurred on engines equipped with the subject solenoid-operated shut-off valve. The FAA considers that all of those events could have been prevented if the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shut-off valve had been installed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For these reasons, the FAA has determined that installation of the solenoid-operated shut-off valve is appropriate and warranted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters do not support the need for the issuance of the proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These commenters state that the Model 747 has been shown to be controllable following  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all incidents of in-flight deployment of the thrust reversers. They contend that these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incidents of deployment occurred at idle thrust, and that the proposed modification would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only help in preventing uncommanded deployments at idle thrust or where improper  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lockout of the reverser sleeve had been performed. The FAA does not concur with these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters' inference that issuance of the rule is not necessary. The FAA acknowledges  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that, in all of the known events of in-flight thrust reverser deployments, the flight crews  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were able to control the airplanes and land safely. At the time this rule was proposed,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> there was insufficient data to demonstrate that the airplane would be controllable in all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> phases of flight following deployment of a thrust reverser. Recently, however, Boeing has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> presented the results of a study it conducted on the controllability of the airplane following  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an in-flight deployment event in several phases of flight. The results of this study revealed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that these airplanes could experience certain control problems in the event of a thrust  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reverser deployment occurring during high speed climb or possibly during cruise. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional information on the controllability of the airplane following deployment of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> outboard thrust reverser further demonstrates the need to install the solenoid-operated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shut-off valve. For example, if the thrust lever is moved rapidly to the ``idle'' position from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a high power setting, and the DCV vent is plugged (e.g., by ice), the thrust reverser could  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deploy at a high thrust level as the engine decelerates. The installation of the shut-off  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> valve is designed to prevent pneumatic drive air from powering the PDU, unless the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> airplane is on the ground and ``reverser thrust'' is selected, thereby preventing in-flight  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deployments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters request that the proposed rule be revised to allow the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accomplishment of certain revised maintenance practices, in lieu of installation of the shut-off valve. These commenters point out that the majority of the incidents of in-flight  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deployments of thrust reversers have involved improper or outdated maintenance practices  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relative to deactivating the reverser. The Model 747 Maintenance Manual has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revised to delete all deactivating procedures except one, which involves disconnecting the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> PDU drive shafts and then ensuring that the reverser sleeve is locked in the stowed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> position. The commenters contend that, with such procedures now deleted from normal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintenance practices, circumstances that previously would have led to a deployment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incident will now be eliminated. The FAA does not concur. Although this new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintenance procedure may serve to preclude in-flight deployments caused by improper  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deactivating procedures, the FAA finds that no maintenance procedure can prevent in-flight deployments caused by blocking of the DCV vent (by ice, foreign objects, etc.).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, the FAA points out that several revisions had been made previously to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Model 747 Maintenance Manual in an attempt to prevent in-flight deployments of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> thrust reverser, yet deployments have continued to occur. As stated elsewhere in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preamble, the FAA considers that the installation of the subject shut-off valves would have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prevented 30 of the 31 known incidents of in-flight deployments on Model 747's, since  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those incidents involved blocking of the DCV vent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Numerous commenters request that the proposed compliance time of 24 months  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for modification be extended to between 36 months and 5 years. Several of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters point out that there is a 300- to 400-day lead time necessary for purchasing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and obtaining necessary parts. This lengthy lead time for parts delivery would seriously  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hamper affected operators' ability to comply with the proposed rule within a 24-month  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deadline, and would cause major scheduling problems, delays, and flight cancellations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other commenters request an extension to in order to allow the modification to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accomplished during a regularly scheduled ``heavy'' maintenance visit (``D'' check) at a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> main base, where required equipment and trained personnel would be available. The FAA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agrees that the compliance time can be extended somewhat. Based on information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided by the commenters concerning parts availability, the FAA has determined that a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance time of 36 months is appropriate in order to accommodate the time necessary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for affected operators to order, obtain, and install the modification; and will not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compromise safety. The final rule has been revised accordingly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Certain commenters request that the proposed rule be revised to permit the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> installation of unmodified engines after the effective date of the AD and until the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance time for modification. These commenters point out that proposed paragraph  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) would require that, as of the effective date of the rule, no operator install an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unmodified engine on any airplane. However, to comply with this paragraph, operators  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would have to modify all spare engines prior to the effective date of the AD; this would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impossible, due to the lead time necessary to obtain parts, and would impose an economic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> burden on operators. The FAA concurs. The final rule has been revised to permit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> installation of an unmodified engine up to 18 months after the effective date of the rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This compliance time of 18 months is based on a 1-year period that would be necessary to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obtain parts, plus a 6-month period to modify all spare engines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter requests that the proposed rule be revised to require the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> installation of a new PDU to prevent the back driving of the thrust reverser. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenter has installed such a unit in accordance with Boeing Service Bulletins  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 747&hyph;78&hyph;2084 and 747&hyph;78&hyph;2090, and Garrett Service Bulletins 126712&hyph;78&hyph;1432 and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 126236&hyph;78&hyph;1332. Since installation, this commenter has not experienced any in-flight  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deployments of the thrust reverser. The commenter recommends this installation in lieu of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the shut-off valve that would be required the proposed AD. The FAA does not concur.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The modification referred to by the commenter entails the installation of a reversible PDU  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in place of the gear-driven PDU that was installed on earlier Model 747 airplanes equipped  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with Pratt &amp; Whitney JT9D engines. The pneumatic control system used with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reversible PDU is similar to the control system used with the gear-driven PDU. One  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> difference is that a ``directional switcher actuator'' is used with the reversible PDU, in place  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the ``gear switcher actuator'' used with the gear-driven PDU; however, both actuators  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are similar in design, and their deploy chamber vent paths are the same. Therefore, if the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> DCV vent, deploy signal line, or the directional switcher actuator deploy chamber port  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> becomes plugged, the directional switcher actuator could move to the ``deploy'' position.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If this occurs, the thrust reverser will deploy when the thrust lever is moved to the ``idle''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> position, just as is the case for the gear-driven PDU configuration. Installation of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subject shut-off valve will prevent this from occurring. In light of this, the FAA has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined that installation of the shut-off valve is necessary, regardless of the type of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> PDU that is installed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

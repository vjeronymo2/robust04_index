			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Public's distrust of militarism is rekindled: Likely consequences of the hard-fought passage of the UN peacekeeping bill THE TORTUOUS passage of the United Nations peacekeeping bill through the Japanese Diet, finally accomplished on Monday, is a measure of the difficulties the country faces in defining for itself a role in the world. Opposition parties won little credit for reducing the Diet to a farce in their efforts to block the legislation. They were roundly criticised by Japanese newspapers for undermining the principles of parliamentary democracy by abusing Diet procedures. Yet the opposition antics reflect the serious concerns many Japanese have about the bill which would permit the government to send Japanese troops on United Nations peacekeeping missions. If the issue had been put to a referendum, the government would almost certainly have lost. Opinion polls indicated that more than half the population are opposed to any bill which would allow the armed forces to serve overseas. A senior cabinet official acknowledged the extent of this hostility at a recent press conference when he told journalists: 'I hope you are more impartial (in judging the bill) than the Japanese people.' To outsiders it might seem bizarre that Japanese are so sensitive about the bill. After all, the legislation looks so innocuous - it authorises the government to despatch up to 2,000 people on UN missions, but only if they serve in non-combatant support roles, carry nothing more than small arms and withdraw at the first sign of trouble. However, many Japanese have invested the legislation with much wider meanings. They see in it an attempt to revise the country's pacifist constitution and a way of reviving the power of the military in Japan. They also dislike the fact that the bill has been foisted upon them by an internationalist elite - led by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs - seeking to increase Japan's role in global affairs. Peace Net News, a magazine run by opponents of the bill, has argued that the passing of the legislation could lead to a revision of the constitution and even 'to moves to introduce a system similar to compulsory military service'. The bill's supporters argue that such views have no basis in fact. They point to the fact that almost the whole international community has welcomed the bill. Even Japan's Asian neighbours, which would be the first to feel threatened by a revival of Japanese militarism, have been very reserved in expressing doubts about the legislation. The conservatively inclined Yomiuri newspaper said in an editorial yesterday that people would be reassured when they saw the peacekeeping bill in operation. Japanese would realise that isolationism in the modern world was tantamount to egoism. 'To maintain order in international society, we have to think of the need of sharing risks.' But the arguments do not sway the bill's opponents. They are haunted by Japan's inability to fully come to terms with its aggression during the second world war. 'The difficulties (over the bill) stem from the war,' says Professor Akihiko Tanaka, an expert in politics at Tokyo University. 'People do not trust the military.' Unlike Germany, Japan has never made a full and frank admission of its responsibility for invading Korea and China or for starting the Pacific War. While the late Emperor Hirohito and his son Emperor Akihito have apologised for various acts of aggression, as have government ministers, their words have often been undermined by subsequent backtracking by other political figures. Japanese people have been kept in ignorance of basic information which are not included in school textbooks - such as the fact that the allies considered - and later rejected - trying Emperor Hirohito for war crimes. Instead, the belief grew that responsibility for the war rested entirely with a smallish group of military officers, who were eliminated during the post-war occupation. In these circumstances, it is understandable that many people are hostile to any talk of expanding the military's role today - even in UN peacekeeping operations. But the fact that such hostility is understandable greatly complicates Japan's political future. If the the country's leaders cannot convince people of the merits of serving under the UN flag, there is little prospect that they can even begin to consider more sensitive issues - such as the possibility of a regional role for Japan's defence forces. Such a possibility is admittedly very remote as long as the US remains committed to policing the western Pacific. Neither in the US nor in Japan is there much serious talk about revising the bilateral security pact which binds the two countries together and keeps American troops in bases in Japan. But it is not difficult to imagine incidents in which US and Japanese interests might differ. Would the US necessarily protect Japan's sea lanes if they were blockaded somewhere in south-east Asian waters? If civil war in an Asian country forced Japan to evacuate its nationals, would American troops protect such a rescue mission? These are small examples. On a bigger scale, both the US and Japan have protested to North Korea about its nuclear development programme. If Pyongyang did acquire such weapons, it would be quite reasonable to expect at least some government officials in Tokyo to consider whether Japan might respond by developing nuclear arms of its own. Such incidents, and possible Japanese responses, could generate profound ructions in Japan. It is worth remembering that the event which most disturbed Japan's political stability since the war was the signing of the US-Japan security pact in 1960. The demonstrations in Tokyo were so serious that President Eisenhower cancelled a planned visit to Japan for fear for his safety. Acutely aware of popular resentment of the peacekeeping bill, the government yesterday announced a publicity campaign to explain its purposes. Ministers will have their work cut out. Japan will send a delegation to Cambodia to study the military situation there following the passage of the peacekeeping law, Reuter reports from Tokyo. Mr Masamichi Hanabusa, a foreign ministry spokesman, said no date had been set for the mission. Tokyo news reports said the team would leave within the next month to lay the groundwork for sending Japanese defence force personnel in September to join UN peacekeeping efforts.</p>

			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / Arts: Spoleto - without music - William Weaver is entertained by Mamet, Williams and Dario Fo The spoken theatre - the 'prose' theatre, as Italians call it, even when the dramas are in verse - has always been a part of Gian Carlo Menotti's Festival of Two Worlds, though its position has been ambiguous. Some years, drama occupied a major role, and new plays by Tennessee Williams or by Italian writers like Giuseppe Patroni Griffi have been presented in Spoleto's houses. In other years, music and, often, ballet have played the major roles, while one or two plays were given, dutifully, almost as filler. This year, Italy's drama critics flocked to Spoleto, where they were offered the continental premiere of David Mamet's Oleanna, as controversial here as elsewhere; and a revival of Williams's Streetcar named Desire, in a superior new translation by Masolino D'Amico and an aggressive, even brutal, but always coherent staging by Elio De Capitani, with a set by Ferdinando Bruni that erased all reference to New Orleans, all local colour (indeed, all colour of any kind). Somehow, this abstraction made some of Williams's poetic tirades, which seemed outdated almost when they were written, become more acceptable, a part of the general madness. This grotesque approach, however, did not rob Mariangela Melato's Blanche of her touching magic. Aleksandar Cvjetkovic pulled off the amazing feat of looking and dressing like Brando, yet still giving a strong, individual, original performance. Critics, in speaking of Dario Fo, tend to call him not an actor but a 'man of the theatre.' To some extent, this description simply means that, in addition to performing, he also writes plays and stages them. But there is more to it than that: Fo is one of those artists who, no matter what he does, remains himself, Dario Fo, even while he is convincing you that he is an industrialist or a pope or a clown. So when it was announced that he would perform two works of the 16th century Paduan dramatist Angelo Beolco, known as 'Ruzante,' the admirers of Fo and the admirers of this elusive, rarely-performed late Renaissance master were understandably excited. In the event, apparently for bureaucratic reasons, the production could not be realised; instead Fo devised a 'meeting' with Ruzante, which was perhaps more useful, if less fun. The evening - Fo standing behind a lectern - began with an almost academic presentation of the figure of Beolco, placing him in the political and social context that are so important to understanding his work. But understanding his work is arduous for a more specific and straightforward reason: he wrote almost entirely in the Paduan dialect of his time, virtually incomprehensible to today's Italians, even if they come from Padua. After his professorial introduction, Fo began to read, practically to perform, first alone, then with the collaboration of his wife and co-star Franca Rame and two other actors, some passages from Ruzante, which Fo had translated not into Italian, but into a modern Paduan-Venetian dialect to some extent of his own invention. For many members of the audience, this was almost equally strenuous to grasp. Even at the lectern, Fo indulged in his familiar posturings and grimacings. Finally, one was certainly convinced of the importance of Ruzante, less convinced perhaps of Fo as the writer's ideal interpreter. It may be that Ruzante's theatre - like that of Plautus, his spiritual ancestor - cannot be reproduced in modern terms. A sad thought, but one that is hard to dismiss. For some years a regular, highly popular feature at Spoleto has been the season of the marionettes of the Carlo Colla and sons, a company that has delighted generations of Milanese children (and adults) for about a century and a half. Menotti, one of those children, on hearing a few years ago that the Collas were losing their home, helped rescue the troupe, along with the incomparable patrimony of original sets, costumes, texts, scores, and - of course - marionettes, and festival audiences have enjoyed a series of revivals, including the grand spectacular ballet Excelsior which, with human actors and dancers, was a triumph at La Scala in the 1880's. This year, in the now-deconsecrated church of Santa Maria della Piaggia, which has been made into a theatre for them, the Collas presented a lesser, but charming piece, Dalla terra alla luna, with a moon-walk (or rather moon-dance, with wedding, that made NASA look cheap). Another recent and fascinating intrusion of the spoken word at the festival is the series of interviews, under the rubric Testimoni del tempo (Witnesses of our time), conducted by the critic and journalist Elena Doni, who has the gift of being understated without fawning and informed without showing off. This year her series of guests included Arthur Schlesinger, who attracted a capacity crowd to the intimate Sala Frau, a perfect setting. There, relaxed and urbane, he answered Doni's questions - as well as those of the audience  -with pointed wit, evident concern, and profound knowledge. For some Italians, it was a revelation to see this multi-faceted mind at work; and it was clear why so many leaders, Kennedy at their head, listened to the speaker with attention. Nowadays, every event at Spoleto sells out; and on weekends the town is jammed. And yet, it remains unspoiled. Or rather, it improves, from the festival-goer's point of view; as a new hotel, like the elegant Palazzo Dragoni, or a fine new restaurant like the Apollinare, make a stay in the Umbrian jewel still closer to perfection. Only the audiences are sometimes a trial. Since Spoleto has become 'in,' the visitors eager only to be seen and, if possible, to spot some celebrity, shamelessly talk through performances (one even read his newspaper during a lovely chamber concert), leave before the end. But this is the price Spoleto pays for its success.</p>

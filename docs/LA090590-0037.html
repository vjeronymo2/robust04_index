			<p><P> September 5, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SHOOTING VICTIM, DRIVER HURT IN CRASH  </P> <P> A shooting victim and a good Samaritan who was driving him to the hospital were  injured Tuesday morning when their car crashed and overturned in Mission Hills,  Los Angeles police said.  </P> <P> The shooting victim, Anthony Christianson, 24, of Thousand Oaks, was then taken  by ambulance to the Northridge Hospital Medical Center and was in stable  condition after being treated for a gunshot wound to the chest and cuts and  bruises from the car accident.  </P> <P> Police declined to name the car's driver, who also suffered minor injuries in  the crash.  </P> <P> Lt. Harvie Eubank said the incident began about 3:30 a.m. when Christianson  pulled into a service station at Nordhoff Street and Sepulveda Boulevard and  was confronted by a gunman who demanded money and shot him in the chest. The  gunman fled on foot without taking anything.  </P> <P> Witnesses told police that Christianson went into the service station and asked  for help getting to a hospital because he did not want police or paramedics  called.  </P> <P> A 34-year-old customer who was in the store volunteered to drive Christianson's  car and take him to a hospital, police said. But as he drove the car onto a  nearby Sepulveda Boulevard on-ramp of the Simi Valley Freeway, the car swerved,  hit a truck and went off the road and flipped, police said.  </P></p>

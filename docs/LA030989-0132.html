			<p><P> March 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DOGS NOT ALLOWED LOOSE ON BEACHES  </P> <P> The Wendy Lamm photo and caption of a dog on the beach (Times, Feb. 9) imply  that dogs are legally allowed on our beaches; they are not. As spring and  summer approach, now is a good time to point out that loose dogs have become  such a health and safety hazard on the beaches that lifeguards are empowered to  order people and their dogs off the beach. A dog owner is liable for a $46 fine  for a dog on the beach and another $46 fine if the dog is unleashed; this  happened to an acquaintance.  </P> <P> This is not a petty issue, for the public's knowledge of health and safety  guidelines is all for the common good. Unfortunately, from our home of 38 years  on the Ocean Front Walk in Venice, my family has sadly witnessed, along with  crass commercialism, a dispiriting decline in people's consideration for each  other and our community. Nowadays, people tend to behave as advised by the  song: "Don't worry, be happy." I suggest that each of us and our communities  would be better served by less self-indulgence.  </P> <P> GORDON ELKINS  </P> <P> Venice  </P></p>

			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / Russia goes for breakneck sell-off HUNDREDS of Russian companies are to be sold at breakneck speed in a political gamble to make privatisation irreversible by April, when the country faces a referendum over its future constitution and fresh parliamentary elections. Fourteen of Russia's 49 regions are to be included in a campaign to sell around 500 big and medium-sized enterprises, Russian authorities and their western advisers said yesterday. Other regions will proceed at their own pace in contributing to the goal of selling 6,500 enterprises this year. Russia is taking a different approach to eastern Europe where privatisation was slow, mainly because enterprises were restructured before sale and large-scale privatisation was under centralised control. Russian reformers argue they have neither the time nor money to proceed the same way. 'Rather than looking for good companies to sell, our objective is to sell all companies,' said Mr Anthony Doran, an executive from the International Finance Corporation, the World Bank's investment arm advising five of the regions. Accountancy firm Price Waterhouse is to help with privatisation in another five. Up to 51 per cent of shares will be sold to the workforce and remaining stakes will be offered for cash and privatisation vouchers to be distributed to every Russian citizen by the end of this month. There are no restrictions on foreigners taking part even though few are expected to do so at this stage. The pilot project is to kick off in the Volgograd region, better known by its wartime name of Stalingrad, where 200 companies up for sale will include the tractor plant which switched to tank production during World War Two. Enterprises are being cleared for auction by regional authorities after passing basic 'survivability tests' which amount to a snapshot of their condition over a relatively short period.</p>

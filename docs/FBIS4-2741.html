			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Y.C. Tsai] </F>   [Text] Taipei, April 13 (CNA) -- Despite the current wave  of boycotts against exchanges with Mainland China, a leading  plastics producer in Taiwan has decided to go ahead with its  investment projects there.    Nan Ya Plastics Corp. announced following a shareholders'  meeting Tuesday [12 April] that the company will channel NT$710  million (U.S.$26.79 million) into the mainland for five  investment projects.    As an affiliate of the renowned Formosa Plastics Group, Nan  Ya's investment plans have become the focus of attention here.    The five projects include a soft PVC [polyvinyl chloride]  roller-press factory in Guangzhou, PVC pipe factories in Anhui,  Shangdong, and Fujian Provinces, and a PVC fitting factory in  Guangdong Province, a company spokesman said.    The spokesman noted that the investment plans, which will  take the form of joint ventures among Nan Ya, other Taiwan  plastics producers, and their mainland counterparts, will be  soon submitted to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for approval.    If all goes well, he said, the soft PVC roller-press factory  in Guangzhou will begin production next June.    Nan Ya made the decision to open plants on the Mainland at  the request of downstream plastics producers, many of which have  relocated to the Mainland and rely on Nan Ya for raw materials,  he said.    Formosa Plastics Chairman Y.C. Wang declined comment on Nan  Ya's Mainland investment plans.    Meanwhile, the domestic business community is still outraged  at Beijing's inhumane handling of the March 31 Qiandao Lake  disaster, in which 24 Taiwan tourists were killed.    Both the National Federation of Industries and the General  Chamber of Commerce called on domestic manufacturers not to  visit the mainland until Beijing authorities clear up questions  surrounding the incident.    The federation's planned trip to northern Mainland China in  May was also canceled, and preparations for a seminar on  business arbitration across the Taiwan Strait were suspended.    Taiwan investors must join hands to press Mainland China to  ensure protection of Taiwan tourists, investors and their  property on the mainland, Chamber of Commerce President Wang  Yu-cheng said.</p>

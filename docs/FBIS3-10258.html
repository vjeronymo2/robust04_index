			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] CONACOM, the National Congress of Democratic  Movements, is backing the resolution voted on 2 March in the  Chamber of Deputies. The party said so in a news conference  today. Rothschild [Francois] filed a report:    [Francois] Good Morning. CONACOM is on the same wavelength  as  the Haitian deputies. Victor Benoit's party has just brought its  unconditional support to a plan for settlement of the crisis,  voted as a resolution on March 2 by the deputies. In a meeting  with the press today, CONACOM asserted that it welcomes the  legislators' initiative. CONACOM, which participated in the  discussions in Washington that resulted in the elaboration of  this plan, believes this document represents a compromise  between the two antagonistic sectors, President Aristide and  General Cedras. CONACOM also believes that the legislators'  resolution takes into account the demands of both sectors in the  Haitian crisis. According to Victor Benoit's party, this  resolution represents a step in the right direction, toward the  Governors Island accord.    [Begin Benoit recording, in Creole] CONACOM strongly  supports  the legislators' proposal and the resolution of the Chamber of  Deputies for the following reasons:    A. It is a good proposal, in compliance with the country's  Constitution, the Governors Island accord, the New York pact,  and the Miami conference.    B. It is a good proposal, written in a spirit of compromise.  It respects President Aristide's demands -- his return to power  in Haiti and Gen. [Cedras'] anticipated retirement. This  proposal also respects the general's demands: amnesty for the  Army and for many people within society. It respects the demands  of the entire political sector: the formation of a government of  national concord, sociopolitical appeasement following national  reconciliation. This proposal also respects what all the classes  in the country are demanding: the lifting of the embargo so the  people can operate under good conditions. [end recording]    [Francois] Questioned on President Aristide's position --  who  has already rejected this plan presented by the legislators --  the CONACOM leaders indicate that they do not seek confrontation  with the president-in-exile. According to Micha Gaillard, one of  the members of CONACOM leadership, the party intends to continue  talking with President Aristide on that question.    Regarding the post of prime minister, the CONACOM secretary  general denied that the trip to Washington was to negotiate such  a position. In any case, Victor Benoit points out that if  President Aristide asks him to govern the next government, he  will be ready to accept such a proposal.

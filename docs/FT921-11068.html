			<p>920203 FT  03 FEB 92 / International Company News: Petrofina tumbles 25% CONSOLIDATED profits at Petrofina, the oil company and Belgium's largest industrial group, slipped by nearly 25 per cent in 1991, from BFr21.7bn (Dollars 665m) to BFr16.3bn. The results were hit by the 66 per cent decline in profits at Fina, the group's US affiliate, which made only Dollars 42m in the year, compared with Dollars 125m in 1990. Fina reported a 17 per cent drop in the average well-head price for the company's crude oil and natural gas production, and a 15-year low for natural gas prices. A cost-reduction programme is under way, as is the sale of 'non-strategic' upstream and downstream assets. Overall, Petrofina's group production was down 1.4 per cent in 1991, with reserves almost unchanged at 849m barrels. Sales of petroleum products rose 1.4 per cent, despite the recession in its main European and US markets. The profit figure also included an extraordinary amortisation charge of BFr1.7bn, reflecting the effect of changed accounting rules and adjustments to the value of inventories to bring them into line with market prices.</p>

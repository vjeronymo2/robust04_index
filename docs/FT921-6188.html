			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Government to cut rebate for Serps opt-outs THE GOVERNMENT yester-day announced a cut in the rebate it offers to those who opt out of the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme, thus lowering the age at which holders of private pensions lose out by not rejoining the government scheme. Mr Tony Newton, social security minister, said that from April next year the rate of rebate will be cut to 4.8 per cent of earnings from the current 5.8 per cent. The 2 per cent incentive offered to those opting out for the first time will be cut to 1 per cent. The government actuary has called for a rebate of 4.68 per cent. Mr Newton also said he was considering offering higher rebates to older people and less generous ones to those in their 20s. The insurance industry, which provides most private pensions in the UK, has largely opposed moves to an age-related rebate system, arguing that it would not provide enough incentive for young people to opt out. Flat-rate rebates favour those in their 20s and 30s by offering them tax breaks far in excess of those to be achieved by remaining in Serps. But according to actuarial calculations, by the time a man is roughly 45 and a woman is 40 the rebate is no longer sufficient to justify maintaining a private pension. Actuaries at Legal and General, the UK insurer, said the new rebates would cut the opt-in ages to 40 for men and 32 for women. Mr Michael Meacher, shadow social security secretary, yesterday accused the government of bribing more people to take out personal pensions. Speaking in the Commons he said a Labour government would not implement the proposed age-related rebate of 1 per cent.</p>

			<p><P> August 24, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CAMBODIA  </P> <P> As an immigrant from Cambodia, I would like to comment on the column "Only a  Speedy Alliance Can Stop the Butchers" (by Jeremy Stone, Commentary, Aug. 1).  </P> <P> I think it is a great mistake for Stone, the U.S. government and some U.S.  senators and representatives to think that the Hun Sen government, which was  installed by Vietnam in 1980, is the best hope for Cambodia.  </P> <P> Since the 18th Century, Vietnam has wanted to annex Cambodia. Ho Chi Minh  talked about Cambodia in an Indochina under Vietnamese Communist Party control.  We Cambodians do not like the Khmer Rouge killings, but we like even less being  absorbed by Vietnam.  </P> <P> The best hope for Cambodia is a government elected by all factions representing  real Cambodian people.  </P> <P> JACK K. KRENG  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

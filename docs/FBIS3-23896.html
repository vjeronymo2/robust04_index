			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by V. Ivashchenko: "Chinese Peasants Outpace </F> Russians"]    [Text] Negotiations have begun in the Jewish Autonomous  Oblast on bringing Chinese seasonal laborers into the fields of  collective farms in the Amur region. A delegation of businessmen  from the PRC visiting Birobidzhan is prepared to bring,  immediately if desired, hundreds of Chinese peasants into local  villages in exchange for metals, fertilizers, and equipment.  Last year more than 600 gast-arbeiters from the neighboring  country were working in the former sovkhozes and kolkhozes of  the autonomy alone. Some private farmers have engaged the  foreign "hired farm hands" as well. In this regard, instances of  illegal transport of Chinese were noted, for which no one was  held accountable.    Today freedom of transport of manual labor from abroad is  significantly restricted by recently adopted governmental  documents. The engagement of foreign labor is subject to  mandatory licensing with local administrations, for example.  This measure is a timely one in the opinion of many, because the  previous lack of control led many times to sad consequences for  the Russians involved, who suffered losses from cooperation  which was not always equal.    Last year's experience shows that unemployed Chinese travel  to Russia not so much to work hard in the fields as to engage in  trading at the flea markets. And in no way do all of them manage  to accomplish both tasks without detriment to the harvest.  Because of this, some farms in the autonomy were forced to  cancel contracts and send the sad excuses for helpers back to  their native land early.    Nonetheless, the oblast agricultural administration assures  us that in the majority of cases, bringing in foreigners is well  justified. At least as far as money is concerned. Certain farms  have been able to obtain up to R50 million in profit through the  Chinese--a ponderable alternative to bank credits borrowed at  213 percent interest, which is still not available to all...    But cautions are being sounded today as well: Excessive  enthusiasm for foreigners might destroy our own peasant labor.  Seasonal workers live day to day--it is important to them to  achieve a result right now. But no matter how impressive the  result, the main problems of the Russian agrocomplex over the  long term will not be resolved by virtue of Chinese labor.    Finally, is it not strange to be finding jobs for unemployed  foreigners when our own out-of-work people have nowhere to go?  Arguments that "our own" are not offering to help and are  showing no initiative are hardly legitimate. No one has yet  summoned them to the fields; no one is training or organizing  them.    But the oblast administration labor department believes  priority will soon be confirmed for the Russian unemployed  worker. Even if only through licensing: Farms and enterprises  situated in the so-called manpower-surplus regions are about to  get their marching orders. This, incidentally, is also a  requirement of the federal authorities.</p>

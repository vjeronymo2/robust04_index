			<p>BFN     [Text] President Liamine Zeroual this morning received at  the headquarters of the presidency Mr. 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Dali,  Yemeni Socialist Party official in charge of foreign relations  and special envoy of Mr. 'Ali Salim al-Bidh, vice president of  the Presidential Council of the Republic of Yemen.    The meeting was attended by Foreign Minister Mohamed Salah  Dembri, and Mr. Mihoub Mihoubi, diplomatic adviser and official  spokesman of the presidency of the Republic.    In a statement to the radio about this meeting, the Yemeni  envoy said:    [Begin al-Dali recording] I was asked by brother 'Ali Salim  al-Bidh, vice president of the Yemeni Presidential Council, to  make this visit. I have a message related to the situation in  Yemen and the recent developments it has witnessed, and also to  the efforts made by Arab brothers in past months to overcome the  crisis experienced by Yemen. This visit is also related to the  stance of our brothers in Algeria toward these efforts. In  fact, we found a very big response, in what we have heard, and a  great eagerness for security and stability in Yemen, for Yemeni  unity, and for the implementation of the pledge and accord  document signed in Amman. [end recording]    Asked about the mediation the Arab Maghreb Union, chaired by  Algeria, will undertake in an effort to solve the difference in  the leadership of fraternal Yemen, Mr. 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Dali  said:    [Begin al-Dali recording] We consider that both in Algeria  and outside Algeria we have brothers, so we do not use the word  mediation. However, we consider that the Yemeni issue is  Algerian, Maghreban, and Arab; consequently, their contribution  will be a strong one. I would call it a strong contribution,  not a mediation.    We welcome every Arab effort to help Yemen get out of its  present situation and ensure that it has more guarantees for  future unity and stability. [end recording]</p>

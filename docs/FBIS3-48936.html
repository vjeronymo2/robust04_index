			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 1 January (TANJUG) -- The independent  train drivers' trade union of Serbia has adopted a decision to  end the strike and immediately establish regular service  throughout the territory of Serbia, the information center of  the Belgrade public railway transport enterprise announced this  evening.    There are no details in this laconic statement, which  contains only one sentence, about the ending of the strike that  has been going on since the day before yesterday in the  afternoon, nor about what was agreed between employers'  representatives and the government on the one hand, and the  strike committee on the other. One thing, however, is certain:  This was a particularly "nasty" strike in terms of its  consequences for thousands of passengers who were unable to  travel over the holidays and who suffered greatly in waiting  rooms and on platforms.</p>

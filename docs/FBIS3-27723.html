"We agreed to resolve this issue in this manner in  consideration of the state and the people," Hosokawa said at a  joint news conference with Kono, president of the main  opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP).    "I am filled with deep emotion," Hosokawa said about the way  legislation had been concluded, after signing a 10-point  agreement on the final shape of the four-bill package.    Kono, who signed the accord after Hosokawa, said they  confirmed that the two are responsible for tackling  international and domestic challenges now that the conclusion of  the debate on long-delayed political reform is assured.    "We could not have reached the agreement without the spirit  of concession," he said. "I am happy that we reached the  accord."    Hosokawa and Kono negotiated for nearly six hours with only  brief breaks from Friday night to early Saturday, the final day  of the current extraordinary Diet session.    Hosokawa had staked his political future on enactment by  Saturday of necessary measures to revamp Japan's corrupt  political system through electoral changes and tighter curbs on  campaign funding.    The agreement calls for replacing the present 511 multiseat  constituencies for the House of Representatives with a mix of  300 single-seat constituencies and 200 proportional  representation seats.    The accord also provides one fund-raising group for each  politician to receive donations from businesses and  organizations.    The government's political reform bills will win  parliamentary clearance on Saturday, but will be revised in the  next regular Diet session, according to the compromise deal.    Hosokawa, who heads the seven-party coalition government,  revealed he will hold another round of talks with Kono early  next week to discuss the languishing Japanese economy and the  Japan-U.S. framework trade negotiations and other issues of  national concern.    Hosokawa noted that he had to make some painful decisions  against the largest force in the coalition, the Social  Democratic Party [of Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ], in his talks with Kono.    While acknowledging that the revision amounts to a retreat  from the government's original package, the premier noted the  amended legislation would make the flow of corporate and  organizational donations to individual politicians "more  transparent, at least than under the current law."    The SDPJ had demanded that individual legislators be  prohibited from receiving such money, which is seen as a root  cause of rampant graft in Japanese politics.    Asked if the joint appearance before the press with his  political archrival Kono will affect the framework of the ruling  coalition, Hosokawa said, "honestly, I cannot make any  prediction."    Kono said a number of national challenges, including the  bilateral trade talks with the United States and the sluggish  economy, are critical to the quality of life in Japan, and he  expressed the LDP's readiness to supply the coalition government  with its expertise and manpower.    The LDP held the reins of government for 38 years until last  August, when Hosokawa's coalition knocked the party from power.    Hosokawa said he and Kono concurred that there are numerous  issues that cannot be resolved without making a "political truce"  between the two factions.</p>

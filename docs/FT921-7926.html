			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Drayton Consolidated hit as Alma appoints receivers SHARES in Drayton Cons-olidated Investment Trust fell 43p to 147p yesterday on the announcement that receivers had been appointed to Alma Holdings, an unquoted confectionery company in which Drayton was a main shareholder. Alma, which is headquartered in Dundee, Scotland, owns some of Britain's oldest and most popular sweet brands, including Barker &amp; Dobson, Keillers, Bensons, Hacks and Victory Vs. It has about 7 per cent of the sugar confectionery market. Mr Rod Owen of receivers KPMG Peat Marwick said his immediate priority was to sell the company, and that he was in contact with several prospective buyers. The company would continue trading, and all staff would be kept on for the moment. Alma, with six operating subsidiaries which have been placed in receivership, has annual turnover of about Pounds 52m and employs almost 800 people. In the 18 months to June 30 it made a Pounds 10.5m operating loss. Drayton first invested in Alma in October 1988, when the family-owned company underwent a Pounds 29m management buy-out led by Mr Mario Maciocia, whose father founded Alma, and simultaneously acquired the Barker &amp; Dobson confectionery business for Pounds 9.75m. Since then, the company has been rationalised and opened a factory. A new management team was appointed in 1990. However, its financial performance was handicapped by unexpectedly large losses at Barker &amp; Dobson and by a high level of debt, which stands at Pounds 22m. Mr Maciocia was reported to have admitted that Alma over-stretched itself to buy Barker &amp; Dobson. Drayton said yesterday that a buyer had been sought for Alma after sales in the final quarter of last year fell well below budget. Following a worldwide tender process, discussions began with an unnamed prospective bidder. However, following a further deterioration in Alma's performance this year, the bidder withdrew 'in favour of an asset-based purchase'. A receiver was appointed after it became clear that such a deal would have rendered the rest of the business insolvent and that Alma's bankers and shareholders were not prepared to extend financing. Alma has factories in Dundee, Kirkcaldy and Glenrothes and a sales office in Manchester. Drayton details, Page 24</p>

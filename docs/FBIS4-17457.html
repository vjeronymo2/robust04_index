			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Sergey Blagov] </F>   [Text] Hanoi, 22 Apr (ITAR-TASS) -- The presidents of  Russia and Ukraine have agreed that a friendship and cooperation  treaty between the two countries must be drafted in the near  future. This was stated in an ITAR-TASS interview today by  Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko who is paying an  official visit to Hanoi. At their meeting in Moscow on 15 April  the Russian and Ukrainian presidents instructed their foreign  ministers to complete the preparation of the draft treaty. In  this connection Leonid Kravchuk invited Boris Yeltsin, president  of the Russian Federation, to pay an official state visit to  Ukraine. The invitation was accepted. We hope that the  interstate treaty will be signed during this visit, the  Ukrainian foreign minister said.    Referring to the talks in Sevastopol between the Russian and  Ukrainian defense ministers, A. Zlenko stressed that "the  decisions adopted at the April meeting of the two presidents  must be carried out." The accords already reached on dividing  up the fleet and separate basing of the two countries' naval  forces must be implemented. By adhering to these accords,  without backing away from them, we can make progress toward a  solution of the Black Sea Fleet problem. If, however, attempts  to reinterpret the decisions made by the two presidents  continue, I think we will again find ourselves deadlocked as we  try to settle this "extremely complex" question, A. Zlenko noted.</p>

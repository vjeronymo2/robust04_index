			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: News Corporation Short of assuming Chinese citizenship, Mr Rupert Murdoch's original plans for buying into the Hong Kong-based TVB television station appear stymied. But Mr Murdoch's career has repeatedly illustrated an uncanny knack for skirting the biggest of obstacles. Beaming The Sound of Music into China appears his latest obsession. One way or another, it is a fair bet that millions of Chinese will be humming The Hills are Alive by the end of the decade. News may yet be able to gain access to TVB's valuable archives by means of a restructured deal. It may then seek an alternative base for an Asian satellite station. After a prolonged period of enforced consolidation, News is certainly well placed for renewed growth. The company's free cash flow may surpass ADollars 800m this year with no substantial debt repayments until near the end of the century. News seems interested in expanding in US TV stations. Its interest in a 15 per cent stake in Australia's Channel Seven shows it is not neglecting opportunities in its back yard. Although the media industry is intrigued by News' renewed energy, it is not clear that shareholders are equally enamoured. News' grand industrial ambitions have rarely produced swift financial returns. After their surge in 1991-92, News' shares have hovered around the ADollars 7.50 mark all this year. The benefits of reduced interest rates on its ADollars 10bn of debt have already become apparent. News has simply had its recovery earlier than the rest of the Australian market. It will be a while before the financial implications of its next great leap forward materialise.</p>

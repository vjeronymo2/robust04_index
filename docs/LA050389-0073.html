			<p><P> May 3, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> The toll of injured West Berlin police officers rose to 322 from a May Day  march that erupted into the city's worst riot in several years, police said. A  police spokesman said that about 2,000 marchers left the parade in the city's  Kreuzberg district and pelted officers with stones, bottles and firebombs.  Demonstrators, many of them masked, smashed windows of banks and shops, looted  food and liquor stores, overturned and set fire to cars and built blazing  barricades. Police, who used tear gas and water cannon to quell the  demonstration, arrested at least 16 people.  </P></p>

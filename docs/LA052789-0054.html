			<p><P> May 27, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WEATHER SUITED FOR A HOLIDAY  </P> <P> Those who have felt cooped up on the job since Easter week can look forward to  a balmy Memorial Day weekend tempered only by night and morning low clouds  along the coast and hazy sunshine in the afternoons.  </P> <P> "It's going to be kind of cool at the beaches in the mornings with some low  clouds and fog," said Patricia Cooper, a meteorologist with WeatherData Inc.,  which provides weather forecasts to The Times. "Otherwise, it's going to be  great for doing just about anything."  </P> <P> Overall, temperatures will range from the upper 60s at the beaches, to the  upper 70s and lower 80s in the inland valleys, Cooper said. Mountain areas can  expect temperatures in the mid-60s to mid-70s through Monday, with locally  gusty winds of up to 30 m.p.h. that could cause problems for picnickers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hot in Deserts  </P> <P> Deserts will remain hot, with temperatures in the lower deserts ranging from 95  to 105 degrees. Temperatures in the high desert will hover in the 80s.  </P> <P> "We are anticipating a lot of people coming out to enjoy the beach," said Bob  Moore, spokesman for the Los Angeles County Department of Beaches and Harbors.  "But there have been some riptides that could be a danger for swimmers."  </P> <P> Boaters from Point Conception to the Mexican border can expect to encounter 2-  to 4-foot waves and gusts of up to 28 m.p.h., Cooper said.  </P></p>

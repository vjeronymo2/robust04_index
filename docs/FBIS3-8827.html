			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina  Network in Serbo-Croatian at 0900 GMT on 16 March carries in its  regular 10-minute newscast several reports on the fighting in  the republic.    Reporting on the situation in Maglaj, Hajrudin Sermic says  that "the town underwent the heaviest shelling last night  between 2000 and 2100, when one person was killed and four were  wounded. The unequal war that [Serb military leader Ratko]  Mladic's gunners are waging against the Maglaj people is  continuing in the face of international indifference."    Mirza Sadikovic reports from Bihac that "last night after  1930 the Serb aggressor intensified his artillery and tank  attacks on the [word indistinct] and Bihac regions. They also  attacked the other parts in the operational zone of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina [B-H] Army 5th Corps and the Bihac HVO  [Croatian Defense Council]. One women carrying a child was  killed in Bosanska Otoka, and several other people were wounded.  Over the last 24 hours, the chetniks have been targeting the  defensive positions in Grabez and the Grmusko-Srbljanski Plateau  with howitzers from Gorija." He says that "the chetniks are  again bringing in new forces as they cannot reconcile themselves  to their inability to capture the railroad and the road  alongside the Una River in order to connect their two fictitious  parastates."    In his report from Bugojno, Emir Avdakovic says that "after  several days of relative quiet, early this morning the chetniks  from their positions in Koprivnica again started firing tank and  howitzer shells at the town. The general alarm was sounded and  the Bugojno people are now in their shelters."    Hamiz Deronjic reports from Brcko that "our positions were  last night targeted by howitzers, tanks, and mortars. A chetnik  122-mm howitzer from the direction of (Tresnjica) was firing at  the central sector of the Brcko defense. From Sumari an enemy  tank was firing at Jasici and Boderiste." He says that this  morning there is "heavy sniper fire at the defense lines."    The B-H Army 3d Corps Press Center says that "even though  they have occasionally violated the cease-fire with some small  arms fire, the HVO has shown over the last few days that they do  want peace in this region. The same cannot be said for  Karadzic's chetniks, since they have been preparing for attacks  on almost all the fronts held by the 3d Corps. To judge by the  intensive movement behind their front lines, the chetniks are  not giving up on Zavidovici and the southern corridor. Apart  from significant movement of their motorized vehicles and  military hardware, they have been keeping up their provocative  artillery and small arms fire." The reports says that "yesterday  extremists from the HVO violated the cease-fire several times  with 12.7-mm sniper rifles in the region of Bistrica. Even  though it was quiet in the Lasva Valley, two nights ago a [HVO]  unit of 40 to 50 soldiers moved the front line a little by  entrenching in (Busovacke Staje), thus violating the cease-fire  agreement."</p>

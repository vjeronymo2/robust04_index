			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / UK Company News: Teredo board under fire from Cairn Energy CAIRN ENERGY, the oil exploration and production group which has made a hostile Pounds 1.5m bid for Teredo Petroleum, the indebted oil company, yesterday hit out at the board for not recommending acceptance. Cairn's all-share offer currently values Teredo at 4.8p a share. Cairn's share price has increased by 20 per cent since it launched the bid following a gas discovery in the US. Mr Bill Gammell, chairman of Cairn, has asked shareholders in Teredo to consider what plans its board has to secure the future of their company beyond Friday, when interest repayments on Pounds 7.4m of debt fall due. Shareholders should ask what plans the directors have for reducing a level of gearing approaching 600 per cent, he said. Teredo, which has a majority of small private investors, holds its annual meeting tomorrow. The board has not recommended acceptance of the offer although it has suggested shareholders strongly consider it. First day for acceptances is today . Cairn said it is interested in taking over the company because of its onshore oil production facilities which border those of Cairn. The company has an option over Teredo's loan note of Pounds 1.4m.</p>

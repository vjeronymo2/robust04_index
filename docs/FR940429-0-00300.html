			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary is concerned with the plight of students who have been misled by unscrupulous schools, or who have been harmed by a school's failure to fulfill its obligations (such as the payment of a refund to the student). Practices of this sort are violations of 34 CFR part 668, subpart F, which governs misrepresentations by schools. The Secretary will take a broad range of sanctions against schools to enforce these provisions. The Secretary also notes that recent changes made to Title IV, Part H of the HEA will reduce the incidence of school malfeasance. Further, the Secretary will determine if relief can be provided to such students in future regulations or legislative amendments. However, not all cases of school malfeasance can currently be classified as a school's ``false certification of a student's eligibility to borrow'' that would permit a borrower to receive a loan discharge under the HEA. For example, although misrepresentations regarding the school's educational program or its financial or administrative capability, including the school's placement services or the quality of the school's facilities, faculty, or equipment, may well have induced the student to enroll at the school, those representations are not part of the process of ``certification'' of the student's eligibility to borrow.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Change:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The final regulations have been revised to permit false certification discharges in cases where the school, without the authorization of the individual, signed a person's name on the loan application or the promissory note. In addition, the regulations provide relief where the school, without borrower authorization, endorsed the borrower's name on a loan check or authorization for electronic funds transfer, providing that the student did not receive, directly or indirectly, the benefits of the loan proceeds disbursed by that loan check or authorization for electronic funds transfer that was signed by the school. The regulations will include provisions for a borrower to appeal to the Secretary if the borrower disagrees with a guaranty agency's decision that the signatures in question were signed by the borrower.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 682.402(e)(3)(ii)(C)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 49.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Some commenters believed it was unnecessary for the student to certify that he or she was certified by the school on the application for the loan as an eligible student. The commenters believed that this information is seldom known to students because they may never see or understand what the school wrote on the application. The commenters noted that the student could generally deduce that the school had made such a certification by the fact that a lender made the loan, but believe that the same deduction could just as easily be made by a guaranty agency or the Secretary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary agrees with the commenters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Change:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The final regulations have been revised to delete this requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 682.402(e)(3)(ii)(D)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 50.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Some commenters believed there is no statutory justification for denying a false certification discharge if the student was able to obtain employment in the occupation for which the student's program was intended to provide training.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the case of a discharge based on a school's defective certification that the student had the ability to benefit from the school's training, this was discussed in detail on pages 2488&hyph;2490 of the NPRM published on January 14, 1994 (FR 59, No. 10). The Secretary believes that the ability of a student to obtain employment in the occupation for which the student's program was intended to provide training is evidence that the student was able to benefit from the education received, even though the school may have improperly tested, or failed to test, the student's ability to benefit from the school's training.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

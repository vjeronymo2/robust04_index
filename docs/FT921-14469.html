			<p>920116 FT  16 JAN 92 / German growth rate fell to 3.2% last year THE twin burdens of unification and recession in export markets slowed west Germany's economic growth rate to 3.2 per cent in real terms last year, the government statistics office said yesterday. Although higher than the 2.4 per cent average growth in the past 10 years, it was the weakest result since 1987, when gross national product (GNP) rose 1.5 per cent, and contrasted sharply with the 4.5 per cent 'boom' rate in 1990. The figures show that west Germans tightened their belts last year: private consumption and state demand increased by only 2.4 per cent and 1.2 per cent respectively, compared with 4.7 per cent and 2.1 per cent in 1990. But nothing could prevent the widening of the gap between the old federal republic and the five former DDR states, and a sharp rise in state borrowing to a record DM87bn (Pounds 30.6bn). The first figures since unification showing 12 months' results from both sides of the country, revealed that east and west together generated GNP worth DM2,807bn, of which the east - with 20 per cent of the united country's population - contributed just DM193bn, or just 6.9 per cent of GNP. Every western worker produced goods and services worth DM88,800 last year, compared with DM26,300 in the east. Average gross incomes in the five new states, meanwhile, rose to 45 per cent of western levels. GNP figures for the final quarter of last year, due yesterday, were not published, although a statistics office official was reported to have said they 'appeared' to show no improvement on the previous quarter. Private consumption in the west in 1991 was almost halved, mainly by the impact of a 7.5 per cent income tax levy and other duty rises imposed to help fund projects in the east. Inflation averaged 3.5 per cent during the year, although the GNP price deflator, an indicator of domestically generated inflation, rose 4.4 per cent compared with 3.4 per cent in 1990. State borrowing, pushed up by the DM11bn cost of Germany's contribution to the Gulf war, is expected to fall to about DM45bn this year. Despite the setbacks, and recent further deceleration in growth, officials insisted that Germany had not slipped into recession.</p>

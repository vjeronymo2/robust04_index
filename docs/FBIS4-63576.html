			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Denis Perkin] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 24 May -- The meetings with Russian  President Boris Yeltsin and Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin  in the Russian capital were "most useful," Douglas Hurd, British  secretary of state for foreign and commonwealth Affairs, said,  speaking to correspondents at Vnukovo Airport today at the end  of a three-day official visit to Russia.    The British foreign secretary declared that particular  attention was paid to the situation in Crimea during his  conversation with the Russian president. He said that the  Russian side occupies a clear and precisely expressed position,  considering this issue to be Ukraine's internal affair. The  Crimean peninsula is a part of Ukrainian territory, therefore  disputes arising around it must be resolved through dialogue  between Kiev and Simferopol.    Overall, Douglas Hurd summed up, complete understanding was  reached on the whole range of problems discussed during the  visit. The Foreign Office head confirmed that Queen Elizabeth II  has accepted an invitation from the Russian president to visit  Russia, and that this visit could take place before the end of  this year.    The same day the British minister left Moscow for Kiev.</p>

			<p><P> March 29, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH SENDS TOP AIDES TO ASSESS SPILL DAMAGE  </P> <P> President Bush Tuesday dispatched three top officials to Alaska to assess the  massive oil spill there as political controversy began to escalate over  Administration plans to expand oil drilling in an environmentally sensitive  part of the state.  </P> <P> Bush summoned Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner, Environmental  Protection Agency chief William K. Reilly and Coast Guard Commandant Paul Yost  to the Oval Office for an early morning meeting before sending them to Alaska  to "take a hard look at where this disaster stands."  </P> <P> Bush said after the session that he had received "conflicting reports" on the  progress that Exxon Corp. had made in containing the spill. "I don't want to  prejudge that," he said, asking the top-level team to report back to him on  what additional steps may be needed.  </P> <P> Those steps could include federal civil penalties against Exxon, Skinner said.  The Coast Guard, which is leading federal efforts to combat the spill, will be  responsible for deciding whether Exxon violated federal regulations in its  operation of the oil tanker that struck a reef and ruptured, causing the huge  oil slick. Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh said that Justice Department lawyers also  will monitor the situation.  </P> <P> With Exxon officials now admitting that the cleanup so far has gone poorly,  Bush said that a federal takeover of the effort is "an option" that Skinner,  Reilly and Yost would assess. Under that approach, which Administration  officials currently consider unlikely, the government would pay for the cleanup  and then seek reimbursement from the company. Federal disaster relief officials  Tuesday also were reviewing a request from Alaska Gov. Steve Cowper for  additional federal emergency aid.  </P> <P> Despite the attention generated by the scope of the spill -- the largest in  U.S. history and one of the worst ever -- Bush said he felt no need to review  his Administration's plan to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil  drilling. "I see no connection" between drilling in the reserve and the  contamination in Prince William Sound, Bush said.  </P> <P> Environmentalists, however, who have been battling the drilling plan for  several years, lost no time in making a connection. Opening up the wildlife  reserve to drilling, they stressed, would greatly increase oil shipping along  the tanker route from the port of Valdez through Prince William Sound, the  formerly pristine waterway fouled by about 10 million gallons of oil since the  Exxon Valdez accident Friday.  </P> <P> The oil spill is a "giant alarm clock" that should awaken the nation to the  environmental dangers that inevitably accompany major oil drilling programs,  the "Group of 10" major environmental organizations said in a statement. Bush's  plan for "environmentally prudent" drilling in the wildlife reserve is a  contradiction in terms, they said, and they asked for a new study to be made of  the full environmental impact of drilling.  </P> <P> "We find no independent scientists who say you can develop the Arctic coastal  plain in an environmentally prudent way," said former Wisconsin Sen. Gaylord  Nelson, who now heads the Wilderness Society.  </P> <P> The environmental groups called on Bush to ask the National Academy of Sciences  to conduct the new impact study, noting that Bush already has ordered such a  review of drilling off two sections of the California coast.  </P> <P> Although Administration officials argue that the oil from the wildlife area is  needed to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil imports, environmental  advocates argue that energy conservation measures, such as increasing the fuel  efficiency of new cars, could have the same impact.  </P> <P> Environmentalists have made a long series of objections to drilling in the  reserve, which is the principal calving area for 180,000 migratory caribou and  a breeding ground for 300,000 geese and millions of shore birds.  </P> <P> In addition to the risk of further tanker accidents, they charge that noise and  exploration activity could disrupt wildlife and toxic drilling muds and other  wastes could seriously pollute the areas around the wells.  </P> <P> "No matter how many precautions are taken, the unthinkable can still happen,"  said Lisa Speer, a senior attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council.  "The only way to keep the unthinkable from happening in environmentally  sensitive areas is to keep oil development out."  </P> <P> While arguments escalated about future policy, Administration officials  continued to try to sort out an appropriate government response to the spill.  </P> <P> Administration officials said that the review team is not likely to recommend a  federal takeover, preferring the current system in which Exxon is directly  paying the costs of removing the oil from the waters and shores of Prince  William Sound.  </P> <P> The company has said that it would cover the full cost of the cleanup, but an  Exxon spokesman Tuesday indicated that the company probably would seek  reimbursement from a special industry fund to cover at least some of its costs.  Under the legislation that first set up the Alaska pipeline system a decade  ago, each of the seven oil companies drilling in Alaska agreed to pay up to $14  million for any cleanup costs. In addition, the companies agreed to set up a  fund to cover up to an additional $86 million in damages for any oil spill.  </P> <P> If cleanup costs and damages exceed $100 million, however, extensive litigation  to establish company negligence might be necessary to obtain more money. In  1978, for example, the Amoco Cadiz, a supertanker owned by Amoco Corp., went  aground on the coast of France during a gale, creating a spill six times larger  than the current Alaska spill. The final damages in that case, about $117  million, were only established last month by a federal judge in Chicago who has  continued to preside over the case despite having retired in the years it has  dragged on.  </P> <P> In part because of that problem, Transportation Department officials said  Tuesday that a government takeover of the clean-up effort would occur only if  Exxon appears unable to handle the task. The federal government would not be  eager to pay the bill until the matter was resolved.  </P> <P> "At the moment it seems both unwise and unlikely, unless something happens that  changes our mind," a senior Transportation Department official said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 30, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CSUN BEGINS WORKOUTS SET AT QUARTERBACK  </P> <P> What is a spring football practice without a quarterback controversy to add  spice to an otherwise drab series of drills?  </P> <P> Cal State Northridge, which started workouts Wednesday at North Campus Stadium,  is going to find out.  </P> <P> For the first time in four years, the Matadors are absolutely, positively  beyond-a-shadow-of-a-doubt sure who will line up behind center to take the  first snap of the season Sept. 2 at Cal State Long Beach.  </P> <P> It will be Sherdrick (pronounced Cedric) Bonner, an interesting, if not  unexpected, choice.  </P> <P> This marks the first time Bonner, a 6-foot-3, 185-pound junior, has been listed  No. 1 on the depth chart at quarterback.  </P> <P> Ever.  </P> <P> The past two seasons he was a seldom-used understudy to Rob Huffman. Before  that, he redshirted a season. And before that, he had a grand total of three  games' experience at the quarterback position while playing for Azusa High.  </P> <P> So why is it that Coach Bob Burt is so confident.  </P> <P> Because he has seen Bonner run, jump, throw and jitterbug around a football  field enough to know that an abundance of athletic ability likely will counter  any lack of experience.  </P> <P> For two years, Burt has referred to his string bean second-stringer as "the  franchise" while favorably comparing him to a young Randall Cunningham.  </P> <P> There is no question that Bonner has the tools for his trade. As an all-around  athlete, he has no peer on the CSUN team. Bonner, who has completed 43 of 77  passes for 584 yards and five touchdowns in two seasons, leaped 6-10 in the  high jump in high school and two years ago was a top reserve on the Matador  basketball team.  </P> <P> "We've had a lot of competition at quarterback in the past, but at this point  we don't anticipate him being threatened for the job," Burt said of Bonner.  </P> <P> The quarterback's supporting cast is headed by tailback Albert Fann, a two-time  All-Western Football Conference selection. Fann, a 6-2, 220-pound junior who  has gained 1,795 yards in his CSUN career, will be running behind an offensive  line that is expected to have five returning starters.  </P> <P> Fullback and wide receiver are the positions with question marks. Russell  Jenkins, Cornell Ward, Don Martin and Larnell Sykes are the top contenders at  receiver. The starting fullback probably will be either Oscar Pittman, a 5-11,  210-pound transfer from San Jose City College; Jason Ferguson, a converted  tailback; or Tim Beattie, a reserve last season.  </P> <P> Defensively, eight starters return for the Matadors, but only one is a lineman  -- 6-5, 255-pound Mike Meehan. John Eichinger, a 6-4, 225-pound junior, is  expected to make an impact at outside linebacker. He transferred from Oregon  where he earned playing time as a freshman in 1986.  </P> <P> "We have talent," said Burt, who is beginning his fourth season. "I feel  optimistic -- I always do. But I feel better about this group than I did last  year. Their off-season program has been as good as any since we've been here."  </P> <P> Northridge will visit Cal State Fullerton after the opener at Long Beach,  marking the first time the Matadors will have faced Division I opponents in  consecutive games.  </P></p>

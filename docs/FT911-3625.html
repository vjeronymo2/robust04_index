			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / UK Company News: Decline in financial printing hits St Ives CITY FINANCIERS are not alone in mourning the dearth of contested takeover bids. St Ives, the UK's largest independent printer, reported a 26 per cent fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 13.59m to Pounds 10.06m in the six months to January 31, almost entirely due to the fall in financial printing. Mr Robert Gavron, chairman, said the company had experienced the worst trading conditions in 30 years. Turnover on financial printing had halved and healthy profits in that division had turned into a small loss. Group sales as a whole fell 8 per cent to Pounds 108.05m (Pounds 117.1m). Earnings per share fell from 8.3p to 6.5p fully diluted but the interim dividend is maintained at 1.5p. The group had no net debt at the half way stage, but gearing was expected to rise to 15 per cent by the year end as a result of completing a Pounds 127m capital programme on new technology and consolidating printing at fewer plants. During the period, St Ives picked up the printing of 50 new titles. About 40 titles had been lost but as most of these had closed rather than gone to competitors market share had increased. Mr Gavron said that despite a pick up in financial printing as result of the recent spate of rights issues, magazine advertising was still sluggish and that division had further to fall before business improved. COMMENT Given the industry is printing 10-20 per cent fewer pages compared with six months ago, a 26 per cent fall in pre-tax profits is neither surprising nor a particularly poor showing. But things are likely to get worse before they get better in the main consumer magazines, offset only partly by an upturn in financial printing. While new printing technology and cost cutting will put St Ives in good shape for the next up-cycle, looming opportunities in Europe may not be wholly welcomed in the City. St Ives seems an obvious partner for VNU, the Dutch publisher that says it wants to spin off its printing arm, or Bertelsman of Germany if it goes the same way. The possibility that such a partnership might require a call on shareholders for cash is likely to overhang the share price. This year pre-tax profits of Pounds 21.5m are expected, giving 14p per share. It looks fairly fully priced with a multiple of nearly 17 times earnings.</p>

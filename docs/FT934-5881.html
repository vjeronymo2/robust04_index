			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Marked expansion at Perpetual Shares of Perpetual yesterday jumped 49p to 780p after the UK authorised and Jersey-based offshore unit trust group reported sharply higher annual profits and hoisted its dividend. Mr Martyn Arbib, chairman of the Henley-based group, said the profits rise - from Pounds 4.79m to Pounds 14.7m pre-tax - emanated from improved stock market sentiment and lower interest rates which stimulated demand for unit trusts. The performance in the 12 months to September 30 was achieved on turnover ahead from Pounds 246.6m to Pounds 842m. Mr Arbib said the group enjoyed a 'significant increase' in its share of an expanded market. Net new investments amounted to Pounds 750m and this, coupled with rising stock markets and a strong investment showing, helped funds under management jump from Pounds 846m to Pounds 2.03bn. Reflecting the buoyant outcome, the proposed final dividend goes up from 3.6p to 13.2p, bringing the total for the year to 15p, against 4.8p.</p>

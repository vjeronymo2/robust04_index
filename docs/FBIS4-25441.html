			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Hsiao Hsueh (5618 7185): "From Tycoon to the </F> Vice President of the State -- Story of Rong Yiren's Political  Career"]    [Text] Rong Yiren is simply a concise modern history of  China.    By the middle of this century, the Rong family had more than  20 cotton mills, dyeing factories, and flour mills, and was the  "richest" in national industry and commerce. Foreign media  called the Rong family the "Rockefellers" of China.    The Rong family originally became from Wuxi in eastern  China.  Of the Rong family, Mr. Rong Desheng and Mr. Rong Zongjing were  enterprise pioneers. Rong Desheng was the father of Rong Yiren.  In February 1896, the Rong brothers set up the Guangsheng  Private Bank at Shanghai's Xiongsheng Wharf with a capital of  3,000 yuan. In their business, they were prudent with every  word and action, and went about things steadily. This has  continued in the Rong family and has become the key to their  devotion to and the success of their enterprise.    The time the Rong family really made a fortune was when they  began the flour business and the textile business.    In 1902, the Baoxing Flour Mill, the first enterprise in  which the Rong brothers invested, began business. Despite  difficulties, they finally set up 12 flour mills under the names  of Maoxin and Fuxin, and 10 cotton mills under the name of  Shenxin, as well as their largest industry -- the Kaiyuan  Machine Factory -- thus supporting the national industry and  commerce in completely devastated old China.    Unexpectedly, the war against the Japanese broke out. After  taking Shanghai, the Japanese aggressors broke into wanton  massacre and looting. The Rongs' enterprises were mostly  ruined, looted, and occupied. Mr. Rong Zongjing was so  infuriated at this that he had a relapse and died in Hong Kong  in 1938. Mr. Rong Desheng then took over the Rong family's  business in Shanghai.    The worst blow to the Rong family was the "kidnapping of  Rong  Desheng" in 1946. Some comments held that the most noted  kidnapping in modern world history was the kidnapping and murder  of the son of the American pilot hero Lindbergh. In modern  Chinese history, however, the most noted kidnapping was that of  the Shanghai tycoon Rong Desheng in 1946.    Rong Desheng, born in 1875, was the father of Rong Yiren. He  was already 71 when kidnapped. He was locked up by kidnappers  for 34 days. The kidnappers demanded a ransom of $1 million,  but they finally agreed to $500,000. In those days, $500,000  was somewhere between $5 million and $7 million today.    Following the incident, the entire Rong family was anxious,  not knowing who might be the next to encounter misfortune in a  time and a world where there was no difference between policemen  and criminals. In order to avoid another misfortune, Rong Yiren  went to study in the United States, yet he lived in constant  fear.    On the eve of liberation, many capitalists in Shanghai left.  Rong Yiren and his father also felt extremely confused. They  had very little understanding of the Communist Party and the  Liberation Army, though they had heard many rumors about them.  Rong Desheng told Rong Yiren that whatever might happen he  would never leave and that he wished to spend his remaining  years in his home town.    As his father had decided not to leave, Rong Yiren became  increasingly hesitant, at a loss for what to do. Seeing this,  his wife, Yang Jianqing, asked someone to rent an apartment for  them in Hong Kong so they could move to Hong Kong in case of  "emergency."    Nonetheless, Rong Yiren and his father did not leave in the  end. Rong Desheng thought to himself that China was, after all,  good for the Chinese. Rong Yiren thought: The communists at  their worst could be no worse than the Kuomintang [KMT]! As  they hesitated, Shanghai was liberated.  <H5>  Invited to Beijing To Discuss the Tax Reform Issue, Rong </H5> Yiren Boldly Says: "It Is You Who Invited Me. I Can Remain  Absolutely Silent If You Don't Want Me To Say Anything."    Rong Yiren recalled, saying: "On 25 May 1949, the Liberation  Army entered Shanghai. I was 33 then. I remember that I drove  a car on the street and saw PLA soldiers lying on the sides of  the street and not disturbing anyone at all. My car pulled up  and a PLA soldier told me, with a polite and honest attitude,  not to cross over because fighting was still going on up ahead  and it was not safe. That was the first time I had met a PLA  soldier, and he was completely different from a KMT soldier.    "In early June, the city's military control meeting asked me  to go over for a meeting," recalled Rong Yiren. "At the  meeting, I met Chen Yi, Zeng Shan, Pan Hannian, and other  leaders. That day, when Sheng Kangnian and Jin Oubu saw me,  they introduced Comrade Xu Dixin to me. Comrade Chen Yi  announced that the party's policy was to allow industrialists  and businessmen to restore their businesses without worry. He  said that they should continue their factory and shop  operations, and that if they had difficulties, they could go and  ask for help from the party and the government. He also said  that the party and the government meant what they said. As I  heard this, I thought to myself that this was a good policy.  Although I doubted whether the government could resolve  problems, I felt that I had to continue my business anyway and  that I would not care until it was in trouble. Therefore, I  went back to the company and arranged for the restoration of  work."    "Between April and May 1950, Beijing called a national  work conference on the tax issue. Industrialists and  businessmen were invited to send representatives to it. I  headed for the conference. Industrialists and businessmen had  never been invited to a meeting on the tax issue before.  Central leaders Comrade Chen Yun (then Financial Committee  director) and Bo Yibo (then Finance Minister) presided over the  meeting. At the meeting, I expressed the opinion of  industrialists and businessmen regarding the questions of  taxation and of readjusting tax rates. I was young then and  said too much. A tax bureau head told me that I said too much!  I retorted: "It is you who invited me. I can remain  absolutely silent if you don't want me to say anything." The  atmosphere suddenly got tense. Comrade Bo Yibo said: "We have  invited industrialists and businessmen to express their views.  It is not right if we don't let them say anything." He asked  me to keep my temper. Gu Huai, director of the Shanghai Tax  Bureau, told me later that after hearing my words, the party  held an overnight meeting and made criticisms and that they  could not go to sleep. I knew from this that the party really  sincerely solicited views from us businessmen, attached great  importance to and seriously considered our views, and that they  were realistic and acted on good choices -- all for reviving the  national economy."    In October 1955, the National Alliance of Industrialists and  Businessmen called a meeting of executive members. Rong Yiren  came to Beijing to participate in it. Mao Zedong also came and  presided over a discussion meeting in person. The meeting  lasted approximately two hours in an earnest and sincere  atmosphere. The "capitalists" said: "We must be a little more  farsighted. We must not fear socialism. We must hold our fate  in our hands and must not be perturbed." Mao Zedong then told  the story of Xiao Guiying, a character in the Beijing opera  theme the "Fisherman for the Revolution." He said: "Xiao  Guiying went to join in the revolution, but he did not forget to  lock his door because he feared that his pitchers and kettles  would be stolen. Industrialists and businessmen are not like  this. They must be a little more farsighted." That was the eve  of the high tide of public-and-private cooperation in joint  ventures throughout the country. Mao Zedong's sincere words  gave lots of food for thought. He said: "If one really works  for the people, really offers help the people, and does good  things for them consistently when they are in difficulty, the  people and the people's government will have no reason to desert  him and no reason not to give him an opportunity to earn a  living and to make contributions."    After the discussion meeting, Rong Yiren felt he was greatly  inspired. On his return to Shanghai, he made a guarantee to the  Shanghai People's Congress, saying: "I surely will invest in  enterprises and purchase public bonds with the profits I have  made to support the country's development."    Rong Yiren remained in Shanghai for a very long time  following liberation, but the financial situation of this city  could be reflected to Zhongnanhai almost every day. In January  1957, Shanghai called the first session of the Second People's  Congress. Chen Yi, who had previously been the Shanghai mayor  and now worked as vice premier of the State Council, went from  Beijing to Shanghai and delivered a sensational speech.    Marshall Chen Yi said in a Sichuan accent: "Chairman Mao has  trusted me with a special task on my Shanghai trip this time.  He wants me to discuss with comrades in Shanghai so they can  vote for Rong Yiren and elect him vice mayor."  <H5>  Mao Zedong Praises Rong Yiren, Saying: "He Is Patriotic and </H5> Capable and Is Fitted for Important Tasks." Chen Yi Said: "As  a Veteran Communist Party Member, I Will Campaign for This Red  Capitalist."    In the eyes of Shanghai people, Chen Yi had a very lofty  status as an old mayor. They had great respect and deference  toward him. Chen Yi said: "Chairman Mao said Rong Yiren is the  first of our country's national capitalists. Now the Rong  family has handed over all their enterprises for cooperation  with the state. This will have a very great influence at home.  He is patriotic and capable, and is fitted for important tasks."    Chen Yi said wittily: "I must admit that Rong Yiren is one  of my best friends. Today, I will campaign for this red  capitalist." There followed a loud applause in audience.    Chen Yi added: "With his special status, he can play a role  among the bourgeoisie at home and abroad which I, Chen Yi,  cannot."    He told a story vividly: Several years ago, a big French  capitalist came and visited Rong Yiren. After chatting with  him, the French tycoon felt very happy. Chen Yi asked Rong what  topics had made the Frenchman so happy. Rong Yiren said in a  perplexed manner: Just some everyday topics like that my family  lives very comfortably and does not fear racketeering or  kidnapping, that we have found goals for our careers and  education, and therefore we want to do more for the state and  are ready to use the fixed interest on our earnings to set up  one cotton mill a year. The foreign capitalist who had feared  the Communist Party as much as a tiger changed his outlook on  socialism.    At this point, Chen Yi asked everyone in a loud voice: "Do  you think we should elect Rong Yiren vice mayor?" His words  were immediately drowned by thundering applause. As a result,  the people's congress resolved to elect Rong Yiren vice mayor of  Shanghai."    In 1959, the central authorities made the decision that Rong  Yiren be transferred to Beijing to act as vice minister of the  Textile Industry Ministry of the Central People's Government.    The transfer should have been a good thing, but the Cultural  Revolution soon began. "Talented capitalist roaders" like Rong  Yiren were the first to become the targets of "dictatorship."    He and his wife were forced to clean the streets and had  their property confiscated. Now the "big capitalist," who is  nearly 1.85 meters tall, was forced to clean the streets and  transport coal.    In the wake of the Cultural Revolution, people hoped that he  would "settle accounts," but Rong Yiren only whispered: "It  doesn't make any sense to settle old accounts."    Deng Xiaoping Said to Rong Yiren: You Are To Take  Charge of Things, but Do Not Make the Enterprise a Bureaucratic  One. The China International Trust and Investment Corporation's  [CITIC] Businesses in 1993 Had Nearly 51 Billion Yuan in Assets    In 1979, Deng Xiaoping had Rong Yiren and several other  former industrialists and businessmen come. They then explored  questions regarding China's opening to the outside world. Deng  Xiaoping asked Rong Yiren to put forward proposals on attracting  foreign capital. He said to Rong Yiren: "You take the lead in  setting up economic entities and in opening windows on the  outside world. The choice of personnel is up to you. You are  to take charge of the business and things, but do not make the  enterprise a bureaucratic one."    Returning home from the long and sincere talk, Rong Yiren  fell into deep contemplation. Afterward, he really came up with  "proposals." He suggested setting up an international trust and  investment corporation in keeping with international practice.  When the proposal reached Zhongnanhai, it immediately won the  full support of Deng Xiaoping and other leaders. Soon  afterward, CITIC, headed by Rong Yiren, was set up.    Later, CITIC made some world-renowned deals, such as taking  over Hong Kong's Ka Wah Bank and investing in building  Australia's Portland Aluminum Mill. CITIC has become a large  "multinational corporation," which last year had over 51 billion  yuan in assets and more than 200 enterprises.    CITIC's great achievements have made "Rong Yiren, the boss"  known all over the world. The Asia Satellite Corporation's plan  to purchase satellites from Houston in 1989 failed as a result  of the sanctions of Western countries. Later, Rong Yiren helped  in the matter and the purchase was concluded. In 1990, the  Asiasat I was successfully launched in China's Xichang.    Rong Yiren is very "harsh" with his subordinates. Before  making a decision, he lets everyone make good preparations and  express their different views. Once a decision is made, it must  be carried out resolutely and must not be defied.    His "precept," which has created the enterprise's prestige,  is very "simple:" "Answer every letter and question." "Tell  only the truth. Do whatever you can and, if you cannot do  something, say so. When people think what you say is reasonable,  they will understand you."    Different from others, he likes "defiant, yet resourceful"  people. He thinks they often have the real expertise and  learning and that they can do great jobs as long as they are  guided properly.    In March 1993, he was elected PRC vice president at the  Eighth People's Congress session.    He considers work the greatest fun in life. He has almost  forgotten the hobbies of flower-growing and photography, which  became his pastimes in his unoccupied moments during the  Cultural Revolution. His only "amateur hobby" now is to watch  television, especially soccer games. He can name, at one go,  many of his favorite Chinese soccer players and remember all  their team numbers.    Rong Yiren's wife, Yang Jianqing, was once a CPPCC delegate.  She is a virtuous woman who supports his husband's career. In  1986, they marked their golden wedding anniversary. They have  five children. The Rong family has over 400 relatives scattered  all over the world, many of whom are celebrated figures of  industrial and commercial circles, as well as scientific circles.</p>

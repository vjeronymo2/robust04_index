			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / International Company News: Corporate Japan piles up on auction block - Robert Thomson in Tokyo looks at the larger deals that have intensified M&amp;A activity Distress sale notices are being pasted in the front window of corporate Japan. Nippon Steel is close to acquiring a majority stake in NMB Semiconductor, a struggling electronics company, while large stakes bought in six Japanese retailers by Shuwa, a developer and speculator, are on the auction block. These large deals follow a sudden increase in merger and acquisition activity among smaller distressed companies, most taken over in purely domestic deals arranged by their main bank. The trend offers opportunities to European and US companies, whose acquisitions in Japan more than doubled last year, and are on the rise. At the same time, Japanese companies' acquisitions abroad fell 60.7 per cent by value last year, according to Daiwa Securities, and a market is emerging for the resale of foreign companies acquired during the heady days of the late 1980s. Recof International, a Japanese M&amp;A boutique, estimates that 70 per cent to 80 per cent of foreign M&amp;A deals by Japanese companies were a failure. The present patterns of M&amp;A activity contrast strikingly with the rapid international expansion by Japanese companies during the late 1980s, when Tokyo stock prices were rising and capital raised at almost zero cost. Executives, believing that the good times would last, miscalculated badly on the long-term cost of investments both at home and abroad. Ailing companies, hit by falling profits and higher capital costs, particularly smaller manufacturers and service businesses, are in need of assistance. Meanwhile, Japanese banks, worried about non-performing loans, are keen to find buyers for corporate clients which appear on the verge of collapse. 'Most of the deals you will not hear about,' explained Mr Yukio Rimbara, general manager of the strategic business advisory division of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank. 'We don't announce the deals, but every day, we are getting calls and transactions are rising rapidly. We have clients with financial problems, and M&amp;A could be a solution for them.' Distressed Japanese companies tend to turn to traditional contacts before thinking of a foreign purchaser. Japanese managers are aware that staff are uneasy about a loss of job security under foreign owners, while there are fears that foreigners would face more general difficulties in adapting to the local corporate culture. As a result, the largest increase in foreign acquisitions, so-called out-in deals, is in strategic purchases by established US and European companies. Purchasers last year included Ciba-Geigy, Atochem, and Philips, with eight of 43 deals in pharmaceuticals, seven in industrial machinery and chemicals, and six in computers, according to a survey by the corporate finance arm of KPMG Peat Marwick. About 60 per cent of deals last year were acquisitions of distributors or joint venture partners, and Mr Thomas Lynch, a partner at Peat Marwick, said most involved companies with sales of less than Y5bn (Dollars 39.8m) and fewer than 100 employees: 'We haven't seen any really big acquisitions yet by foreign companies in Japan, but you might see them in the future.' NMB Semiconductor could have set that precedent. Before Nippon Steel's move, reports had circulated in the Japanese electronics industry that Intel of the US would acquire the company. Intel Japan says now that it will not bid against Nippon Steel, which has apparently agreed to pay Y30bn for 60 per cent of the chip maker. The NMB case is a typical by-product of the hard economic times. Listed on the over-the-counter market in Tokyo, it is still a subsidiary of Minebea, the world's leading maker of miniature bearings, which entered the semiconductor market in 1984 as part of an erratic diversification programme that included a door-to-door cosmetics company and a Canadian pig farm. Minebea reported a consolidated loss of Y13.6bn in the year ended September and does not have the resources to keep pumping funds into NMB, which lost Y12.4bn last year, expects a Y4bn loss this year, and needs capital investment of about Y100bn over the next five years to stay in the chip race. Mr Mike Jeremy, electronics specialist at Baring Securities, said NMB was the 'purest play in Japan' for a company with the funds to take advantage of its chip-making facilities. In theory, bidders could include South Korean semiconductor makers such as Samsung, but that deal could prompt outrage in Japan, where Korean companies do not have the prestige of US manufacturers such as Intel. The other large acquisition move this week involved bids for a 29 per cent stake in Isetan, the department store chain, owned by Shuwa, the troubled developer. Having bought stakes in six retail groups during the late 1980s, Shuwa is conducting a fire-sale to relieve a crippling debt burden estimated at Y1,000bn. 'When people talked about the M&amp;A boom in the late 1980s, this is not really what they had in mind,' an official at a Japanese brokerage said. Instead of expansion abroad, the spate of acquisitions on the negotiating table is an important part of the restructuring of Japanese industry. The challenge for US or European executives wanting to take advantage of this restructuring is to find a company that fits, but not fatally wounded through speculation in stocks or property during the late 1980s. Ailing Japanese companies offered to US or European companies tend to be those turned down by its natural domestic partners, who may have scented danger. Mr Masaharu Yonezawa, a director of Recof International, said the ripest opportunities are in the chemicals, pharmaceuticals, food and computer software industries, but foreign executives must be willing to make a quick decision to take advantage of the environment. 'These out-in cases normally take more than a year, but for domestic transactions three months is a normal time frame. Foreign companies have to speed up the decision process,' he said.</p>

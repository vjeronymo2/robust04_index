			<p><P> May 30, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HARRELSON IS MET MANAGER; JOHNSON OUT  </P> <P> The New York Mets, an organization swiftly beginning to resemble the cross-town  Yankees in style and substance, fired Manager Davey Johnson Tuesday and named  coach Bud Harrelson as his successor through the 1991 season.  </P> <P> Harrelson's debut at the Mets' helm was spoiled by the host Cincinnati Reds,  who won, 2-1, Tuesday night.  </P> <P> Johnson was fired with a 1990 record of 20-22 after compiling the best record  (575-395) in baseball during six full seasons as the Mets' manager, an average  of 96 victories per year and the fourth best percentage (.5927) ever.  </P> <P> However, General Manager Frank Cashen said the team had not played to its  potential since the start of the 1989 season, when it ultimately finished  87-75, six games behind the Chicago Cubs, who won the National League East  title.  </P> <P> "The club was underachieving and needed to go in a new direction," Cashen said.  "Part of the blame is certainly mine. Part of the blame has to be with the  organization and part of the blame has to be with the team. It's not all  Davey's."  </P> <P> Said infielder Dave Magadan: "I'm surprised they didn't fire everybody on the  team and bring up our (triple-A) Tidewater team, considering the way we played.  It's unfortunate, but we definitely had a hand in his firing."  </P> <P> On a recent 3-5 trip to the West Coast, several Mets had criticized the club's  impassive performance and attitude, prompting Howard Johnson to hold a players'  meeting in Los Angeles. The suddenly inspired Mets emerged to rout the Dodgers  twice, but that momentum couldn't be sustained, and Johnson told writers  traveling with the team that his firing was imminent.  </P> <P> "Davey seemed a little bit relieved when I told him," Cashen said.  </P> <P> Said Johnson, after his arrival at the Orlando, Fla., airport en route to his  home in Winter Park, Fla.:  </P> <P> "I wasn't given a reason and I didn't ask for one. I would have liked to have  met with the players to say goodby, but Frank didn't want me to stay around.  </P> <P> "I'm sorry I won't be part of it when the Mets get straightened out, but I have  no regrets. I have to think my record speaks for itself."  </P> <P> Johnson has been criticized some for a laissez-faire approach to club rules  that Harrelson said will now be strictly enforced, and criticized more for his  handling of a touted pitching staff that has been surprisingly inconsistent.  </P> <P> Under Johnson, only Frank Viola, Dwight Gooden and Sid Fernandez started  regularly this year, and Ron Darling, David Cone and Bob Ojeda were openly  frustrated by their uncertain status and occasional bullpen employment.  </P> <P> Johnson escaped firing at the end of last season only because Cashen and vice  presidents Al Harazin and Joe McIlvaine, who form what Johnson liked to call  the "three-headed monster" that runs the Mets, couldn't agree on it.  </P> <P> That divisiveness, then and now, was compounded reportedly by dissension  between owners Nelson Doubleday and Fred Wilpon regarding the Mets' direction.  </P> <P> It is no longer clear, in fact, as to who is in charge of the organization.  Johnson, in some ways, paid the price for a series of moves that stripped the  club of character and much else.  </P> <P> Since the World Series victory of 1986, Kevin Mitchell, Len Dykstra, Mookie  Wilson, Roger McDowell, Gary Carter and Keith Hernandez have all departed,  along with a variety of top prospects.  </P> <P> The minor league well appears to have run dry, and the Mets rank near the  bottom of the National League in offense, as well as leading the majors in  errors.  </P></p>

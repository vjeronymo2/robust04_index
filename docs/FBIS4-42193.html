			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Guy Depas: "Herstal SA: 350 Million Profit in </F> 1993"]    [Text] Seeking to balance its books, the Herstal Group  (formerly FN [National Manufacturer]) has shot last year's  target to pieces. Subject to accounting changes imposed by the  principal French shareholder, Giat Industries, the Liege arms  manufacturer is set to officially announce on 7 June a net  consolidated profit close to 350 million Belgian francs,  following a meeting of the Board of Directors specially convened  in order to ratify the balance sheet for the financial year. In  the previous year, the group had recorded a net loss of 1,125  million Belgian francs.  <H5>  Twenty Billion </H5>   The profit is in line with the hopes expressed just a few  months ago by Albert Diehl, the group's president: Over 20  billion Belgian francs, in which the military branch (FNNH and  Canon Delcour) accounts for just over 9 billion and the civil  branch (Browning-Winchester) for almost 12 billion.    In both cases, performance has exceeded forecasts. Thus,  anticipating the recovery of its U.S. subsidiary, USRAC, and  virtually the only remaining problem being the Italian  subsidiary, rather than a budgeted loss of 325 million Belgian  francs (following a real loss of over 1 billion Belgian francs  in 1992) Browning-Winchester closes with a negative balance of  just 100 million Belgian francs. As work on the reconstruction  of USRAC's U.S. factory is nearing completion, it should break  even in 1994. A slight profit is even possible. As to FNNH,  with profits of almost 500 million Belgain francs it is reaping  the rewards of diversifying its markets.  <H5>  Full Risk Cover? </H5>   What a contrast! The Herstal SA results come at a time when,  from Paris, news of the parent company is so bad that its  directors are placing all their hopes in either a rapid  recapitalization, 2 billion French francs [Fr] or 12 billion  Belgain francs are being requested from the government, or  European regroupings.    The net loss recorded by Giat Industries for last year  amounts to Fr1.2 million or 6.2 billion Belgain francs, which  makes a total loss of Fr2.3 billion or almost 14 billion Belgian  francs since 1990, the crucial year when the group swapped its  status as a state company to that of a limited liability company  with shares owned by the public.    A possible European regrouping with dangers for Herstal SA?  They remain optimistic in Liege. Nobody, they say, is going to  dismantle or sell a subsidiary in which investments are being  made (2.5 billion Belgain francs) and which is absorbing the  losses of its parent company. But the success of Herstal SA is  also due to its autonomy and this autonomy has been earned,  Albert Diehl likes to say. The Meuse FGTB [General Belgian  Workers' Confederation] is considering a reduction in the work  week to 32 hours in order to stimulate new recruitment. Diehl  would not refuse to discuss this, provided no extra costs for  the company are involved. Therein lies the debate, and the  challenge!</p>

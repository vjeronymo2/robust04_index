			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Japanese island turns recession on its head: A land enriched by recent car and electronics industry investment THE JAPANESE economy may be sliding into recession, but you would hardly know it on Kyushu. Kyushu is the country's southernmost main island. It is about the size of the Netherlands and accounts for about 10 per cent of the national economy. It is also soaring on the back of an investment boom, even as capital spending in the rest of the country is plunging. Nissan Motor this month turns the switch on a new assembly plant on the northern tip of the island. Toyota, Japan's biggest car maker, has begun construction of a new assembly facility a few miles inland. Following them are dozens of companies that make car parts and components. Investment in the island's transport industry, including cars and shipbuilding, nearly trebled in 1990, was up by 80 per cent in 1991 and is expected to rise by 56 per cent in 1992 to Y118.3bn (Pounds 512m). With automotive investment following an investment surge by semiconductor manufacturers in the past decade, the island is dotted with some of the world's most technologically sophisticated industrial facilities. Meanwhile, factory output nationally is being slashed and overtime cut. Corporate profits are falling fast, and the stock market languishing at five-year lows. While a Japanese recession looks nothing like its western counterpart (there are no armies of homeless and unemployed or boarded-up shops), in the industrial heartland areas around Tokyo and Osaka property prices are plunging and bankruptcies increasing. In contrast to predictions for the whole of Japan of a 9.6 per cent rise in capital investment (excluding electricity) for the fiscal year which ended last week, investment in Kyushu is going up in double digits - at 15.1 per cent. That is expected to drop next year to only a 0.4 per cent gain, but this is against a national decline of 1.3 per cent. In manufacturing, Kyushu is still expected to move ahead by 6.2 per cent, compared to an expected national decline of 6.1 per cent. It was not always thus. The economy of Kyushu used to be like the rear tyres of a jumbo jet, says Mr Takeshi Okuma, research and planning manager at the Japan Development Bank's Fukuoka office: the last to take off when the economy got going and first to hit ground when recession came. These days, however, Kyushu is looking more and more like a perpetual flying machine. 'The business trends do not affect us so deeply in Kyushu,' says Mr Okuma, with gentle understatement. This seems all the more surprising because the recent prosperity in Kyushu is founded on the two manufacturing industries hit hardest by the slowdown in the economy: cars and electronics. The transformation of the Kyushu economy took place in the last decade following a steady stream of investment from the electronics industry into high-technology semiconductor fabrication and assembly facilities. Manufacturers were attracted by land prices at just 20 per cent of those in the Kanto region surrounding Tokyo. Companies could also save about 10 per cent on labour costs, and found a generally high quality workforce that was easier to recruit. From 1981 to 1986, semiconductor output grew by 30.3 per cent a year, and although growth tailed off to 6.6 per cent afterwards, Kyushu now accounts for about 40 per cent of semiconductors made in Japan, worth Y890bn in 1990. This includes some of the highest technology products, such as the four-megabit dynamic random access memory chips made by NEC in Kumamoto. The list of companies with semiconductor plants in Kyushu reads like a Who's Who of the electronics industry, including Toshiba, Fujitsu, Mitsubishi, Sony, Matsushita as well as Texas Instruments of the US. Semiconductor output this year has been hit by a worldwide drop in the computer and electronics industries, but while overtime may be cut, workers are not being laid off. Mr Hiroto Nabeta, product engineering manager at Texas Instrument's factory in Oita prefecture, says monthly unit output is about 30 per cent below the factory's record one month output. Staff, however, have been redeployed to product development teams, including 12 joint projects with automotive companies for application-specific chips. In Kagoshima prefecture, NEC has recently started construction of a Y50bn facility to manufacture colour liquid crystal display panels. All of this development has gradually changed the quality of life in Kyushu, part of which was once something of an agricultural outback. Indeed one of the sources of growth this year has been a proliferation of leisure facilities, including a sports dome in Fukuoka and a theme park that looks for all the world like a Dutch city on a canal. When Nissan and Toyota advertised internally to recruit production managers to staff their new facilities they found the positions vastly oversubscribed. Most of the applicants were Kyushu natives who decided it was time to return home, where it is still possible for an ordinary salaried employee to afford a house. Japan's economic slowdown will in the end have some impact in Kyushu, as demand growth throughout the economy contracts. Yet the speculative bubble never hit hard in the island and any downturn should pass quickly, since Kyushu will not have to cope with asset deflation.</p>

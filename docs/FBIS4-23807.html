			<p>BFN     [Text] Pretoria June 15 SAPA -- The cabinet committee  appointed to investigate the controversial transfer of three  million hectares of KwaZulu land into the trusteeship of King  Goodwill Zwelithini has recommended he continue as guardian of  the land. The report of the committee, chaired by Land Affairs  Minister Derek Hanekom, was submittted to cabinet on Wednesday  [15 June].    On April 25, two days before the election, the then State  President F W de Klerk assented to the transfer of the land to  the trustee of the Ingonyama [King's] Trust, King Goodwill.    The transfer, made in terms of the KwaZulu Ingonyama Trust  Act of 1994, caused an outcry when it was made public after the  elections, and the cabinet on May 23 appointed a committee to  investigate the act.    Mr Hanekom said in a statement on Wednesday there was  sufficient common ground between the relevant parties to arrive  at an acceptable solution and to secure an appropriate role for  the Zulu king as guardian of the tribal land.    The committee found the goals for the establishment of the  trust were to ensure that land occupied or owned by tribes in  the affected area would vest in them when the new constitution  came into effect.    "The intention was to create a mechanism to preserve tribal  interests in the land, within the present framework of  traditional authority structures. There was no intention to give  the trust the powers of government.    "The act does not make the ingonyama the owner of the land  in  the sense that it is his personal property -- he holds the land  as statutory trustee, subject to existing rights of people," Mr  Hanekom said.    Furthermore, most of the land was already occupied by tribes  and communities since before 1913 and the act would have limited  impact on land redistribution and restitution.    "However, the act results in an unusual mixture of public  and  private law powers and functions. This complicates its  interpretation and application, resulting in uncertainty and  administrative problems."    The committee recommended the act be amended or substituted  so that the ingonyama continued his guardianship of the land,  with his powers and functions described.    The act should address issues dealing with alienation of  land  and resolution of tribal border disputes, and should govern all  tribally-owned land falling within the former territory of  KwaZulu, subject to the existing rights of occupants of that  land.    "Legislation should create a structure for managing the land  which is sufficiently broadly-based to ensure any unwarranted  interference by any person or body, or manipulation of the land  is not possible. This is done to allay any fears of possible  illicit interference or manipulation," Mr Hanekom said.    Legislation to give effect to this decision should be the  subject of consultation between the national government and the  provincial government."All parties should agree and undertake  not to take any action which might pre-empt the implementation  of this decision."    Mr Hanekom said he wished to assure the South African public  that the cabinet committee, operating within a tight deadline,  had taken its task "very seriously indeed". All facts and  implications were taken into account in formulating the  recommendations to cabinet, he said.</p>

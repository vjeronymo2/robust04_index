			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Baghdad, Feb 28, INA--Iraqi press maintained today  condemning and denouncing the Zionist unsightly crime of  massacring the Palestinians performing their prayers inside  Hebron Mosque on Friday claiming tens of lives and injuring  other scores.    AL-THAWRAH daily article says the essential fact, the  Americans and their allies and agents do not want to  acknowledge, is that the people of Palestine who are for more  than forty years waging unremitting struggle and offering dear  sacrifices against encountering Zionist suppression and  occupation, would not be weakened and their determination would  not relax in confronting terrorism and oppression.    The Palestinians would rather continue their strife and  sacrifices till they achieve restoration of their homeland and  right to life, freedom and dignity and establishment of their  independent state on their national soil.    The daily says if the Hebron Mosque massacre has once again  embodied the criminal fascist essence of the Zionist entity and  demonstrated their thirst for Palestinian blood, the U.S.  attitude towards this crime discloses again its unmasked bias to  the Zionist entity and emphasises its keeness on providing  political protection for the Zionist entity at the international  organization, apart from relevant media pretexts and covers.    AL-THAWRAH daily article has further added that as it is  used  to in dealing with the Zionist entity crimes being perpetrated  against the Palestinian people, the United States has been for  some days pursuing efforts, politically and in media not only  for containing and absorbing angry reactions to the crime,  [words indistinct]    At any rate, says the daily, this U.S. attitude is not the  first of its kind and would not be the last. It is rather an  extension to a chain of U.S. stands of bias to the Zionist enemy.    As for AL-QADISIYAH daily it has said that what took place  at  the Hebron mosque on Friday morning has been an expected act and  represented the foundation on which the Zionist entity has been  established since their criminal organisations were founded in  the early of this century.    The daily concluded that the settlement negotiations with  the  Arabs were not stemming from conviction but rather the product  of the policy of imposing the accomplished fact, the [word  indistict] diplomatic apparatus had been pursuing since the time  of Kissinger in order to drive the Arab parties to the  negotiating table.</p>

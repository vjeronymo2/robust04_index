			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / Parliament and Politics: Lib Dems urge borrowing for investment LIBERAL DEMOCRATS yesterday called for a Pounds 6bn increase in public borrowing for spending on investment to bring Britain out of recession. Mr Alan Beith, presenting the party's 'alternative Budget', said the increase was almost certainly greater than the government planned to give away in tax cuts and extra spending next Tuesday. His package, however, was a 'prudent' and temporary increase which would feed through more rapidly into economic growth. Mr Beith, the party's Treasury spokesman, confirmed that extra borrowing would mean the 1p increase in the basic rate of tax which Liberal Democrats have warned might be necessary to fund a Pounds 2bn increase in education spending, would not be needed. However, the party is set to enter the election pledged to reverse any tax cuts announced by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor. The party's economic strategy seeks to identify it as embracing the private enterprise spirit of the Tories with the commitment to public investment of Labour. Full costings, including a self-financing package of tax rates and child benefit increases, will be published with the party's election manifesto. The two-year recovery package unveiled yesterday includes a freeze on the Uniform Business Rate and equalisation between UBR rates in Scotland, England and Wales. Capital spending on schools, hospitals, housing and transport would total Pounds 3bn. A further Pounds 1bn would be devoted to training. Mr Beith said UK public borrowing compared favourably with other European countries and 'a significantly higher level of borrowing at the moment ought not to be an anxiety'. The public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) increases he planned were not inconsistent with the economic convergence targets in last December's Maastricht treaty between EC nations.</p>

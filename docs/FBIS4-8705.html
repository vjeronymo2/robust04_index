			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] A session of the FRY Assembly Chamber of  Republics is under way in Belgrade. Vladimir Nikolic reports:    [Begin recording] The debate is under way about the text of  the declaration condemning the air raid on Serbian positions  around Gorazde by NATO under UN auspices.    Deputy Miodrag Vukovic expressed surprise that some media  presented the declaration adopted at the Citizens' Chamber  yesterday as the Federal Assembly's declaration and the Chamber  of Republics is deciding on it only now. Until a document is  adopted by both Federal Assembly chambers, it has not really  been adopted, Vukovic said.    Deputy Novak Kilbarda is of the opinion that the declaration  cannot be adopted this way. It is incomprehensible that the  activities of both chambers are not synchronized when such major  themes are at stake. Kilbarda has nothing against the  declaration and wants it to be adopted, but does not agree with  its text. He wondered why it does not say in the declaration  that these were the Serbian defense positions and that what was  involved is the Serbian Republic, and not the former  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Deputy Ilija Darmanovic criticized the fact that the  declaration was adopted by the Chamber of Citizens without a  debate and without anybody having said a thing. In Darmanovic's  opinion, the text of the declaration is mild and was the reason  the Serbian Radical Party deputies walked out of the session  yesterday. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee pact to survive US withdrawal THE DEFECTION of the US is unlikely to kill off the International Coffee Agreement, for the time being at least. Sufficient importing members have already agreed to a one-year extension of the pact and the International Coffee Organisation is confident that the one extra exporting member it needs will signal its accession within the next few days. Nevertheless the loss of the biggest consumers has been acknowledged to be a serious blow, not least because of the loss of the large US contribution to the ICO budget. For the coffee market the news, released on Sunday, was of limited immediate interest as the ICA's efforts to support prices have been suspended since 1989, and it has been operating only as a forum for the exchange of views between producers and consumers and as a centre for monitoring the coffee market. In early business at the London Commodity Exchange yesterday coffee traders, who are more interested at the moment in the producers' export retention scheme, which comes into effect on Friday, marked futures prices modestly higher. Anticipation of the producer scheme, under which up to 20 per cent of coffee production will be held off the market, has already pushed prices up significantly. But it also appears to have been the last straw for the Americans, who have never been regarded as whole-hearted supporters of the agreement. In an explanatory statement issued yesterday the US delegation to the London-based ICO said that 'opposition to unilateral producer action, formed outside international commodity agreements, remains the official US stance'. The producers decision to 'go their own way' had resulted in US the administration being 'unable to marshal strong arguments in favour of the agreement' in order to defeat the usual congress amendment to the budget Bill seeking to deny funding for US participation in the agreement. 'In short,' declared the US statement, 'the United States can no longer justify participation in the ICA'.</p>

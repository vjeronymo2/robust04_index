			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / People: Earl returns to UK via Everest and Albania Peter Earl, the corporate financier who last year was joint leader of the Rebecca Stephens Everest expedition, is joining US investment banking boutique Fieldstone Private Capital Group to set up a 'mainstream' corporate finance function from London. Fieldstone was started in 1990 by a team of structured finance specialists who had previously worked for Bankers Trust in New York and London. While it is hardly a household name, even in the City, it was last year ranked second in worldwide project finance by the specialist publication International Financing Review. It has also had a hand in financing every power station built in the UK in the past four years and it was in the course of a similar project in Albania, where Earl has been advising the government on debt restructuring, that the two parties met. Earl's experience, while diverse, has not been with mainstream corporate finance outfits. His own vehicle, Tranwood Earl, which is remembered for its audacious but fruitless bids for the likes of Storehouse, collapsed in 1991. For the past couple of years Earl has been working out of the US, following a complicated deal in which he put The Carter Organization into, and then rescued it from, Chapter 11. As well as his Albanian activities he has recently been working on a communications project in Bolivia, the completion of which he hopes to celebrate in May by ascending a 21,000 foot peak near La Paz. He says his wish to return to the UK is partly caused by a sense that there is a revival of takeover activity. He believes his transatlantic experience will be valuable and likes the idea of the US culture at Fieldstone. 'I've trodden on a lot of toes because that is what the institutions wanted me to do,' he adds, indirectly explaining why he might not fit so easily into a UK merchant bank. Earl is not being made a partner - there are none in London - but says he 'lives in hope'. He is bringing with him to Fieldstone three colleagues from Tranwood days.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] President Yoweri Museveni has congratulated all NRC  [National Resistance Council] members who participated in the  peaceful, free, and fair Constituent Assembly elections which  were held in the country about two weeks ago. The president,  who was addressing a special session of the NRC in Kampala  today, told both winners and losers that the overall winner of  the elections is the country, because of the peaceful and open  manner in which they were held. He advised those who support  the continuation of the Movement type of government not to shut  out support, but to accommodate any Ugandan who says he is for  the Movement system, regardless of his past and present  performance or connections. He also advised those who support  the reintroduction of the multiparty system now to ensure what  they say is responsible and appealed to them not to incite  hatred among the people.    Earlier, the president called for a minute's silence in  memory of Presidents Juvenal Habyarimana of Rwanda and Cyprien  Ntaryamira, who died in a plane crash on Wednesday [6 April]  night. He described their death as a tragic event. Commenting  on the problems in Rwanda and Burundi, Mr. Museveni lamented the  overinternationalization of African problems, which tends to  make people concentrate on winning the ear of the outsiders  instead of listening to their compatriots. Citing Uganda as an  example, he said the people must be left alone to solve their  problems themselves, adding that he advocates African solutions  to African problems, regional solutions to regional issues, and  national solutions to national problems.</p>

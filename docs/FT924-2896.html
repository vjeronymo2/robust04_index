			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Hoare Govett raises Pounds 28.5m for trust launch HOARE GOVETT raised Pounds 28.5m for the launch of its index-tracking smaller companies investment trust. The bulk of the money was raised via a placing; just 521,000 shares were applied for in the public offer. The broker had hoped to raise a maximum of Pounds 50m via the launch and had got firm commitments for Pounds 19.7m in advance. It pointed out that the offer had raised more than recent small company trust launches. The new trust will attempt to track the extended Hoare Govett Small Companies Index (excluding investment trusts) which comprised 1,477 companies at the start of 1992.</p>

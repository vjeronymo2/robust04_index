			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / EC's maternity pay directive blocked ITALY yesterday reiterated its opposition to a draft EC directive on maternity rights, leaving social affairs ministers without their hoped-for compromise during an informal meeting in Wales. The council of ministers has until October 19 to adopt the directive. Today deputy ambassadors of the EC will try to forge an agreement after yesterday's meeting offered the Italians two small olive branches. These included a review of the directive five years after its implementation. In alliance with the European Commission and parliament, Italian ministers have repeatedly vetoed a watered-down package tabled by the Dutch and backed by the 10 other governments. The Italians are seeking 16 weeks maternity pay at a level of at least 80 per cent of the woman's average wage. The other 11 member states have agreed to introduce a right to receive 14 weeks at a minimum of statutory sick pay.</p>

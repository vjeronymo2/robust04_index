			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / International Company News: Merck warning heralds bumpy ride FOR the first time, pharmaceutical groups operating in the US are feeling the effects of price competition. The extent of the change from the 1980s, when drugs companies could increase earnings merely by raising prices, was forcefully underlined this week as Merck, the world's largest pharmaceuticals company, announced a profits warning. The group, regularly voted the best-managed in America, blamed its slowing growth on the increasingly turbulent competitive environment in the US. Healthcare cost-containment measures in other countries and adverse currency movements were also cited. The market has become accustomed to weaker groups such as Eli Lilly forecasting slowing growth, but not companies of Merck's quality. Merck, like other companies, has been hit by the growing power of the US-managed healthcare market to control prices. The proportion of medicines influenced by managed healthcare has increased from about 15 per cent of the market five years ago to about 50 per cent, according to Mr Hemant Shah, pharmaceutical analyst at HKS in New York. Managed health providers, which include private health maintenance organisations and preferred provider organisations, as well as government schemes such as Medicaid for the poor and Medicare for the old, are anxious to keep down drug bills. They are increasingly choosing medicines on price. SmithKline Beechamendured a 1.6 per cent reduction in US prices last year. In therapeutic areas with many medicines in the same class - such as antibiotics, ace-inhibitors (a heart treatment), and gastro-intestinal drugs  -managed healthcare groups have been able to trade one drug off against another to drive down prices. Drugs manufacturers have been forced to compete by offering discounts. Those whose prices are too high risk exclusion from managed healthcare formularies  -the lists of medicines doctors prescribe. Sales growth of Merck's cholesterol-lowering drugs Zocor and Mevacor has been hit by the aggressive pricing of Bristol-Myers Squibb's recently-launched Pravachol. Merck announced temporary price cuts for its cholesterol products this month. Price competition is set to worsen, with a number of significant drugs losing patent protection over the next two years. None of Merck's drugs are directly affected, but the introduction of cheap generic medicines where Merck has relatively expensive patented products will hit sales. Next year, sales of Merck's anti-ulcer drug Pepcid and Glaxo's Zantac are likely to suffer as managed healthcare groups switch to cheap versions of SmithKline Beecham's Tagamet. Merck hopes the profits warning and increased price competition will help convince the Clinton administration that market forces are working in the drug industry. However, Mr Shah believes additional pricing pressure is likely to be created through a vast extension in the purchasing power of the government. The government already accounts for about 15 per cent of the drugs market. After the reforms, the government could cover the costs of retired people's drugs, equivalent to 35 per cent of the market, and those of 37m presently uninsured, representing about 15 per cent of the market. Pharmaceutical groups are now faced with the prospect of falling margins. Merck announced its first job-reduction programme this week. Weaker companies are bound to follow with rationalisation plans. They may then be forced into another wave of mergers.</p>

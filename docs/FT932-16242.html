			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / After Jamaica PM's easy election victory: now for the difficult bit - Canute James on the daunting tasks awaiting Patterson IN THE aftermath of the heady celebrations of the landslide victory of the People's National party in last week's general election in Jamaica, Mr P J Patterson, the prime minister, is likely to be quickly sobered when he reflects on the immediate tasks of his administration. One is how to fire the lethargic economy of the island which has yet to react to the policies which Mr Patterson says are intended to stimulate growth. Another is how to counter an outbreak of violent crime, including factional violence during the election campaign which caused 11 deaths. Related to that is reform to the island's electoral system dogged by administrative deficiencies and thuggery at polling stations. Mr Patterson, who was sworn in at the weekend for a five-year term, has promised to continue the economic reforms started four years ago when the PNP ended nine years of government by the Jamaica Labour party of Mr Edward Seaga. The programme has been based on extensive deregulation of the economy, including the sensitive foreign exchange market, and the divestment of state economic enterprises. The intention, the prime minister said, is to allow market forces a free hand and to reduce the government's involvement in the economy. By all indications, Mr Patterson should not have had such an easy time of the election. The 2.3m people of the island have undergone painful dislocation because of the wrenching adjustment in the wake of the deregulation of the economy. The floating of the Jamaican dollar 17 months ago led to a fall of 40 per cent against the US dollar. The depreciation, and earlier movements of the currency, pushed inflation to 105 per cent late in 1991. The government applied various monetary measures to reduce liquidity and ease pressure on the Jamaican dollar, but a fleeting impression of stability for two months just over a year ago was shattered by another fall of 26 per cent after the resignation as prime minister of Mr Michael Manley. A subsequent revaluation has brought some stability, with inflation last year at 17 per cent. But the majority poor of Jamaica have suffered most from the changes. The government's efforts to eliminate the fiscal deficit and ease pressure on the exchange rate have led to cuts which have reduced the availability of social services such as health and education. Much of the island's physical infrastructure is in disrepair. To have taken 55 of the 60 seats at stake in these circumstances represents no mean achievement. But Mr Patterson may be the first to admit, if only to himself, that he owes much to the disarray within the opposition Labour party. For the past two years Labour has been diverted by a split within the leadership, in which rebel MPs have tried to remove Mr Seaga, blaming his leadership for the party's electoral misfortunes. Mr Patterson was also aided by the absence of any fundamental differences in the economic policies of both parties, in spite of Labour's contention that the PNP had gone too far and too fast in de-regulating the economy. Mr Seaga has indicated that he will reconsider his position as Labour's leader. Party spokesmen have said he will be stepping down to concentrate on private business. His successor will have a difficult task in rebuilding the shattered ranks of the constituency parties before mounting a credible challenge to the PNP in five years. But in spite of the electoral debacle which has overtaken Labour, Mr Seaga, or his successor, may not be too envious of Mr Patterson. The PNP's landslide has raised hopes which the prime minister and his administration may not be able to fulfil. The prime minister has spoken, for example, of an intention to reduce unemployment, currently at 18 per cent, to 12 per cent over the next five years. But there is no sign of the significant new investments which the government expects from economic deregulation. The traditional pillars - tourism, bauxite mining and refining, agriculture and light manufacturing - all depend on the health of the not very healthy industrialised economies. Bankers and businessmen have suggested that the Jamaican dollar will come under pressure in the next few months. A currency depreciation would lead to price increases, and the blame would be placed squarely on Mr Patterson. The prime minister has promised changes in the electoral system to make it more efficient and less prone to abuse and thuggery. He will find it more difficult to curb other unsavoury aspects of Jamaican politics. In a country where party political passions run high, it does not take much for one faction to launch a crusade against the dogs of war of the other side. Unless Mr Patterson and other political leaders can find ways to temper the zeal of their supporters, the prime minister may discover that the economic improvement, of which he speaks confidently, would be substantially devalued.</p>

			<p>920411 FT  11 APR 92 / Letter: Reactions to inflation Sir, Your leader, 'New challenges for Mr Mieno' (April 1), graphically describes the effects of over-reaction to the age of inflation. As you say, 'last year's hero risks turning into today's villain'. Your comments apply all the more to the UK. The terrifying consequences of clinging to the wholly inappropriate discipline of the ERM in terms of flow or zero economic growth and scandalous rises in unemployment for years to come are just not being debated. Why not? The level of currency is an effect not a cause. Winston Churchill discovered this in the late 1920s when obliged to drop the Gold Standard. Peter Stephens, 17 Aynhoe Road, London W14 0QA</p>

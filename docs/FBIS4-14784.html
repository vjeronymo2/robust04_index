			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Video report from Yerevan by "Mir" Television Company </F> correspondent Nune Sarkisyan; from the "Mir" Television Company  segment of the "Utro" program]    [Text] A military delegation headed by Colonel General  Nikolayev, commander of the Russian Federation Border Troops,  has visited Yerevan. The main goal of the visit was to sign an  agreement with the Armenian military in accordance with which  Armenia's state border [not further specified], which is about  300 km long, will be defended by Armenian troops and Russian  border troops. The agreement is the result of repeated meetings  and talks between the two sides, and it gives a legal basis to  the real state of affairs concerning the border troops. [video  shows scenes from the talks, Col. Gen. Andrey Nikolayev being  interviewed]    [Begin Nikolayev recording] It is very important for the men  in uniform, the Russian border guards, and Armenian citizens  that they will now be fulfilling this task together, although  frankly I would like to say that we began doing this work  earlier but that we did not have a sufficiently firm legal basis  for this.    Today we also examined the question of the material and  technical provision and the financing of the groups of border  troop units, (?including) the Armenian group. [end recording]    The commander added that despite the critical situation in  the republic, the Armenian Government is doing everything  possible for the normal functioning of the border guards in  terms of providing the necessary electric power, fuel, and food.  There are sufficient quantities of arms and ammunition.</p>

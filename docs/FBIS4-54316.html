			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 26 (KCNA) -- A Pyongyang mass meeting  was held today to welcome the family of Kim Chae-su who defected  to the northern half of Korea.    Kim Chae-su, born in Chunchon City, South Korean Kangwon  Province, served as a ground man at a puppet airforce flying  corps and an airline company and as a crime-prevention team  member at a police booth and ran an aquatic products company  with his wife Mun Chong-cha till defecting to the North.    Orders and monetary prize were awarded to Kim Chae-su and  Mun  Chong-cha at the meeting.    In his welcome speech, Sin An-pang, vice-chairman of the  Pyongyang Municipal Administration and Economic Committee,  warmly welcomed the family of Kim Chae-su who defected to the  North, believing that the socialist system of the North is a  place where people can live a worthy life.    In his reply speech, Kim Chae-su said the North is a  paradise  where the state regards the people as heaven and spares nothing  for them, whereas the South is a society where the rulers serve  the United States as if it were their grandfather while  oppressing and bleeding the people white for the interests of  the comprador businesses and military bureaucrats.    "Kim Yong-sam advertised 'civilian politics' as if he would  to do something for the nation and the people, but he is also an  A-class traitor and a typical model of exploiter," said Kim  Chae-su.    In her reply speech, Mun Chong-cha said: "In the North, I  feel as if I had come to heaven from the hell. I believe it is  thanks to the benevolent politics of the great President Kim  Il-song and dear Mr. Kim Chong-il that the northern society has  become a large harmonious family where all people live without  any worries."    "I pledge that I will uphold dear General Kim Chong-il and  remain loyal to his leadership together with my husband in order  to consolidate and develop the excellent socialist system of the  DPRK without an equal in the world," she declared.</p>

			<p><P> May 26, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHINA IN TURMOIL;  </P> <P> FRESH RECRUITS FOR STUDENT ARMY ARRIVE BY RAIL TO JOIN BEIJING'S WAR OF NERVES  </P> <P> At one platform of the vast, cavernous and filthy Beijing Railway Station,  fresh recruits arrived from the countryside, stowaways who had come to the  capital Thursday night to join fellow students in Tian An Men Square in a  protracted war of nerves with authorities. Their faces lighted up as the train  pulled into the station to the cheers of sympathizers.  </P> <P> At the next platform, more than 1,000 similarly youthful soldiers of the  People's Liberation Army languished on the hard seats of a parked and darkened  train in which they had been cooped up for more than four days. The troops were  sent here Sunday to help enforce martial law, only to have their exit from the  station blocked by throngs of irate students and citizens.  </P> <P> The scene at the station perhaps sums up the baffling stalemate between one of  the world's most authoritarian governments and its suddenly defiant people.  </P> <P> Exuberant students are banking on the naive hope that they can lead China's  masses in a drive for democracy. But hard-line Communist Party leaders are  emerging from a murky power struggle apparently victorious and preparing to  recoup a humiliating loss of face by making good on an ultimatum to crack down  on dissent.  </P> <P> A curious tension was in the air Thursday evening after Premier Li Peng made  his first public appearance since declaring martial law five days earlier. Li's  grasp on power was confirmed when he was shown greeting ambassadors on the 7  p.m. news broadcast of the Chinese Central Television network.  </P> <P> Employees of the same state-run network were among journalists and  intellectuals who led tens of thousands of people earlier in the day on a march  to Tian An Men Square, expressing solidarity with students who have carried out  a hunger strike and sit-in there for the last two weeks.  </P> <P> An equally large number of people watched and cheered as the protesters arrived  at the square chanting, "Li Peng, step down!" Some of them dared to call for  the resignation of Deng Xiaoping, China's top leader and Li's backer.  </P> <P> "Li Peng's government has lost the trust of the people," said a researcher at  the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. He joined the protest wearing a  baseball cap bearing the message: "To Be or Not to Be, That Is a Question."  </P> <P> But Deng, 84, arouses more ambivalent feelings among protesters than does the  vilified Li. Deng is respected because he is the hero of economic reform, and  he supposedly controls the powerful military.  </P> <P> "We don't want to make him too angry," a student protester said.  </P> <P> Generally, references to Deng have come in the form of mild rebukes, such as  the slogan painted on a subway train earlier this week: "When a Person Gets  Old, He Can No Longer Carry a Tune."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Mockery Grows Explicit  </P> <P> By Thursday, however, the gentle prodding had given way to a more explicit  mockery.  </P> <P> "Xiaoping, Xiaoping, in his 80s," demonstrators chanted. "Health OK, brain not  sharp. Go home quickly. Go play bridge."  </P> <P> A group of music students who perform in a rock 'n' roll band in the  rubbish-strewn tent city erected by protesters in the center of the square  attacked Deng in one of their songs.  </P> <P> "We are masters, not willing to be slaves," the words go. "We want democracy,  we don't need an emperor."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, back at the railroad station, new slogan fodder continued to arrive  from the provinces as students ignored an "urgent circular" issued Thursday by  the State Council warning them to stay away from Beijing. And while rumors  circulated about massive numbers of troops circling the capital, a small group  of students kept a symbolic vigil over the trainload of stranded People's  Liberation Army soldiers.  </P> <P> "We're not afraid of them because they're the people's army," said one of a few  dozen students positioned on a platform near the train. "But we're keeping an  eye on them and trying to talk with them. I don't think they're going anywhere  soon."  </P></p>

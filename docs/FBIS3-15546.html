According to initial reports, this group is to  include newspaper editors and representatives of news agencies  and television and radio broadcasting companies.    The editors cited as the causes of the current crisis of the  "fourth estate" the monopolism of the Ministry of Communications  and the impossibility of destatizing printing plants with the  participation of editorial collectives. In the words of Pavel  Gusev, chairman of the Moscow Union of Journalists, the  mechanism for subsidizing publications must be immediately  changed, creating equal conditions of survival for them. It was  also observed that all branches of power should be legislatively  prohibited from being sponsors of mass media.    Ivan Rybkin gave assurances that the State Duma has no  "pretensions to run or control the press." He stressed that the  State Duma intends to support the mass media and save them from  the "burden of ruthless economic censorship."    Ivan Rybkin proposed that mass media leaders join in  elaborating the draft law on the functioning of the mass media  in 1994-1995, which will enable the press to secure a dignified  existence in the crisis period. In his opinion, this draft law  should include priority measures to ensure the press' survival.  The draft law is due to be examined in session by the State  Duma in late April.</p>

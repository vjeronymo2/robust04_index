			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / UK Company News: LIG warns on restructuring New management at London International Group appears to have taken the opportunity of yesterday's interim results to clear the decks. The group predicted a 'much stronger level of sales and operating profits in the second half year' although warning there would be 'very substantial' restructuring charges. For the six months to end-September losses of Pounds 5.1m before tax (profit Pounds 15.5m) included a Pounds 7.4m swing to losses in its photo-processing business, which is now up for sale, and about Pounds 8m of 'one-offs' according to Mr Nick Hodges, the new chief executive. Group sales rose 1.2 per cent to Pounds 197.1m but operating profits collapsed to Pounds 2.4m (Pounds 22.4m). In health and personal products, operating profits fell from Pounds 16.1m to Pounds 3.5m, while photo-processing incurred a deficit of Pounds 1.1m (profit Pounds 6.3m). The latter normally makes most of its profits in the summer months. LIG revealed that the comparable figures had included Pounds 5m of exchange gains and from the release of provisions not previously disclosed. This year's number had been depressed by about Pounds 2m following 'the adoption of more conservative accounting practices'. Mr Hodges said there had also been a negative effect from a change of the policy to push sales, through higher promotional activity, at the end of each half year. He said this would have a significant effect on the second half too, but thereafter would not recur and would reduce working capital. The UK made a loss of Pounds 1.5m (profit Pounds 8.6m) largely because of the photo-processing division. In the rest of northern Europe there was a Pounds 100,000 loss (profit Pounds 1.5m). In southern Europe, where LIG was hit by recession in Italy and a cut back in the government's drugs bill which reduced customer flow in pharmacies, profits fell from Pounds 6.9m to Pounds 2.4m. North American profits were Pounds 200,000 (Pounds 2.5m) with Africa, Australasia and the Far East contributing Pounds 1.4m (Pounds 2.9m). Losses per share emerged at 4.33p (earnings 6.37p) and the the interim dividend is omitted - 3.2p was paid previously.</p>

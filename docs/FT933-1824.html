			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / People: Charkham's 'rigorous' appraisal 'Mr Corporate Governance' Jonathan Charkham, member of the Cadbury Committee, first director of Pro Ned and author of a yet to appear but no doubt worthy book on corporate good practice, has been appointed a non-executive director of CrestaCare, the nursing home group. This is the second such job he has picked up since retiring from being adviser on industry to the governor of the Bank of England in June. The first was with Great Universal Stores, rather larger than CrestaCare. Indeed, his appointment must be something of a coup for CrestaCare, which has seen its share of governance changes lately with both a new chairman and chief executive in recent months. Current holder of the latter post Andrew Taee, who joined in March after ousting John McAllister from the job, says Charkham put CrestaCare through a 'rigorous' appraisal before accepting. He apparently approved Taee's fixed, three year, Pounds 150,000 a year contract. McAllister, who had a three year rolling contract at Pounds 100,000 a year, is thought to have received Pounds 300,000 compensation. Charkham will chair the audit committee and sit on the remuneration committee. Charkham, a barrister by training, has also served on the committee of corporate governance in the National Health Service, which will be handy experience at CrestaCare - many of whose patients come from the NHS. Scott Svenson is appointed director in charge of strategic development and corporate finance; he joins from Apax Partners.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The second requirement is to establish adequate mechanisms for assisting small business stationary sources with pollution prevention and accidental release detection and prevention, including providing information concerning alternative technologies, process changes, products, and methods of operation that help reduce air pollution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The State has met this requirement by promoting pollution prevention and offering technical assistance through the AQSBAP and several existing programs also within the Environmental Sciences Division (ESD). The AQSBAP and the Office of Waste Reduction Services will help businesses locate and take advantage of pollution prevention opportunities. The AQSBAP and the Education/Outreach program will work together in the development of fact sheets and case studies which highlight pollution prevention technologies. In addition, these programs will jointly participate in seminars and workshops. The AQSBAP will address accidental release detection and prevention by training technical specialists in these practices and technologies. General questions will be addressed by these specialists, and complex questions will be referred to the EPA's Chemical Emergency Preparedness and Prevention Office, or the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Hotline. State organizations, including the State Emergency Response Commission, the Michigan Chemical Council, the Emergency Management Division of the Michigan Department of State Police, and the Michigan Department of Public Health will also be used as resources. The outreach program described in the first requirement above will be used to distribute publications and information about upcoming workshops on accidental release prevention.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The third requirement is to develop a compliance and technical assistance program for small business stationary sources which assists small businesses in determining applicable requirements and in receiving permits under the Act in a timely and efficient manner.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The State has met this requirement by providing an ``800'' number and by offering individual meetings to provide one on one compliance assistance. The AQSBAP technical specialists will be able to identify applicable air quality regulations, determine whether or not a permit is needed, identify methods for achieving compliance, and explain the permitting procedures. The AQSBAP will use the outreach methods described in the first requirement above to disseminate information regarding new standards and requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The fourth requirement is to develop adequate mechanisms to assure that small business stationary sources receive notice of their rights under the Act in such manner and form as to assure reasonably adequate time for such sources to evaluate compliance methods and any relevant or applicable proposed or final regulation or standards issued under the Act. The State has met this requirement by establishing information dissemination mechanisms to ensure that small business stationary sources receive notice of their rights under the Act. The AQSBAP and the MDNR AQD will develop a fact sheet that notifies small businesses of their rights under the Act and Michigan's Air Pollution Act, and explains the legal recourse should they be notified of a violation. This information will be provided during site visits and presentations at trade association meetings, and will be uploaded on the NEWBIZ computer database. The AQSBAP will also develop and disseminate through the outreach program timely fact sheets notifying small businesses of proposed and final regulations issued under the Act that affect their businesses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The fifth requirement is to develop adequate mechanisms for informing small business stationary sources of their obligations under the Act, including mechanisms for referring such sources to qualified auditors or, at the option of the State, for providing audits of the operations of such sources to determine compliance with the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The State has met this requirement by establishing information dissemination mechanisms to ensure that small business stationary sources receive notice of their obligations under new regulations. These mechanisms are the same as those listed above for notifying sources of their rights. In addition, the AQSBAP will develop and distribute a list of consultants that can provide air quality audits of small businesses. The AQSBAP will also develop a fact sheet that helps small businesses select a reputable auditor. In addition, the AQSBAP will investigate the feasibility of implementing its own voluntary audit program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The sixth requirement is to develop procedures for consideration of requests from a small business stationary source for modification of (A) any work practice or technological method of compliance, or (B) the schedule of milestones for implementing such work practice or method of compliance preceding any applicable compliance date, based on the technological and financial capability of any such small business stationary source.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The State has met this requirement by addressing such requests under Modification to Act 348, Part 6 Rules, which contains the procedures that businesses must follow in obtaining approval for such a request. Responses to requests relating to Federal standards will be coordinated with the EPA. The AQSBAP will assist small businesses in identifying these procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Ombudsman  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 507(a)(3) requires the designation of a State office to serve as the Ombudsman for small business stationary sources. The State has met this requirement by establishing the Small Business Clean Air Ombudsman (SBCAO) and the Office of the SBCAO within the Michigan Department of Commerce. The SBCAO is required to represent the interests of small businesses, and to assure that the goals of the AQSBAP are met. The SBCAO is required to perform many duties, including: Conducting evaluations of all aspects of the program; reviewing and commenting on requirements that impact small businesses; facilitating and promoting small business participation in rule development; disseminating information; participating and sponsoring meetings with regulatory officials, industry groups, and small business representatives; investigating and resolving complaints and disputes from small businesses against State or local air pollution control agencies; referring small businesses to the appropriate technical specialists; assisting in the preparation of small business guidance documents; assisting small businesses in locating financial assistance for compliance requirements; and studying the financial impacts of requirements on small businesses. It is expected that the Governor will be making the Ombudsman appointment by June 1994, but no later than November 1, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

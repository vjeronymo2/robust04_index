			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by ITAR-TASS correspondent Mikhail Karlov] </F>   [Text] Moscow March 17 TASS -- Members of the learned  Council of the Applied Ecology Institute who gathered for their  final session here, said on Thursday that "according to  official norms, the accident in Tomsk-7 was estimated,  regrettably, as not very serious."    Institute Deputy Director Andrey Ivanov said in an interview  with ITAR-TASS the following: "It is regrettable that the  Chernobyl disaster and its aftermaths are taken as a standard of  nuclear accidents. Events on a smaller scale are regarded as  not serious."    According to previous reports, the accident took place at a  radiochemical factory of the Siberian combine located near the  city of Tomsk-7 on April 6, 1993. A radioactive discharge into  the air contaminated over 200 square kilometers.    Institute specialists estimated the content of radionuclides  in fresh water at villages which turned to be in the area of the  radioactive fallout, in the air and soil. The permissible doze  for the village of Georgiyevka situated next to Tomsk-7 was set  at 0.15 rem (official norm -- 0.5 rem).    However, specialists did not calculate possible  after-effects  of "hot particles," the effect of which on the human organism is  unpredictable for the time being. Villagers have not been  resettled from the dangerous zone.    Funds appropriated by the federal budget to do away with the  accident's aftermaths were not always used for this purpose.  Additional financing of work entirely depends on the management  of the chemical combine.    Scholars are more optimistic about the radioecological  situation in the Yenisey river basin. A chemical combine  situated in the area of Krasnoyarsk had been discharging  radioactive waste from uniflow nuclear piles into the river for  over 30 years.    As a result, it contaminated water, bottom sediments,  biological objects and flood-lands situated at a considerable  distance from the combine. Direct discharge was stopped in  autumn 1992.    However, the bottom and flood-lands contaminated with  long-lived radionuclides will be for long sources of secondary  radioactive pollution of the river. It is heartening, the  deputy director noted, that the content of short-and  medium-lived nuclides in water sharply dropped after discharges  were stopped.    Regrettably, the content of long-lived cesium-137, cobalt-60  and europeum-152 and -154 virtually did not change. The  scientist noted that these nuclides remain a potential source  for the Yenisey's contamination.</p>

			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / Leading Article: In search of an energy policy IN ITS panicked response to the furore over its plans to close 31 coal mines, the government has opened what amounts to a review of its entire energy policy. Simultaneously, the Commons trade and industry committee will also conduct an equally wide-ranging inquiry of its own. Both these investigations are intended to be complete by the end of the year, a timescale which can only be described as optimistic, given the variety of views they will have to consider. The threat to 30,000 miners' jobs has stimulated calls, some from surprising political quarters, for what amounts to a planned economy in energy. So far, the government has made a poor fist of setting out the market-led alternative. It would be helpful if the committee and the government were to establish a few ground rules. The first should be that there is no question of going back to state ownership of the gas and electricity industries. No one should forget that it was under state control that Britain made a series of unforced blunders about nuclear energy, about overall capacity in electricity generation and in coal, whose future was repeatedly misjudged. This is not to say that the privatised alternative provides a complete answer. Privatisation of both gas and electricity was badly executed, resulting in a private monopoly in gas, now the subject of a monopolies commission investigation, and a duopoly in national electric power generation, buttressed by regional monopolies in supply. Even those who believe that these problems are best addressed by increasing competition must acknowledge that they will always fall far short of perfect markets. Gas and electricity will probably always need a regulator. The immediate cause of the coal debacle, apart from the presentational errors, is the fact that gas and electricity regulation has not evolved rapidly enough for anyone to be confident that generators are making economically optimal decisions in favour of gas-fired power stations. Since, in addition, electricity consumers are required to subsidise nuclear power and other non-fossil fuels, it is clear that the case against the 31 coalmines has been inadequately made. This is so even though it is also true that there is no commercially viable market for the threatened pits' output if the national generators wish to slash their coal-burn in new contracts from next April. Mr Heseltine has revealed that he considered intervening in these contract negotiations to require higher coal consumption but that this was against the law. This is not a law the government would be wise to change so long as it wishes to retain credibility for its privatisation strategy. What is clear, however, is that the regulatory mechanism in these industries, especially in electricity, is not yet working sufficiently well for people to be confident that prices and investments are being decided in as rational a fashion as is possible. Only when regulation of this quality has been achieved will customers and shareholders know whether they are being treated fairly and the generators themselves have a sound basis for determining their fuel purchase and investment strategies. Also, without such information, government will be unable to calculate the cost of subsidising any given fuel, for social, technological or environmental reasons. It would be sensible for both inquiries to focus upon this complex but essential matter.</p>

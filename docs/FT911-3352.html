			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / Letter: The stop-go schools of motoring Sir, You refer to the problems of traffic in densely populated Britain. How does western Germany, with similar population density but already 30 per cent more cars, manage to keep its traffic flowing so relatively well, both on the highways and in the cities? If we introduce further costs for motorists which are out of line with our European competitors, will this not contribute to our economic decline? What about countries such as the Netherlands with much higher population densities? Chris Gannon, Carmela Cottage, High Street, Long Wittenham, Oxon</p>

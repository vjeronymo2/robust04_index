			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Accountants investigate Cupid Cupid, the beleaguered bridal wear manufacturer, is believed to have commissioned a firm of accountants to investigate events leading to this week's warning of substantial losses, writes Peggy Hollinger. The group is also expected to announce the departure of Mr Richard Shaw, chief executive, who earlier this week was suspended temporarily from his duties. Staff at Cupid's Lancashire offices said yesterday he had already left the company. It is believed that Mr Shaw, who was on a 12-month rolling contract, will receive compensation of less than Pounds 100,000. He was brought into the group at the request of shareholders following a profits warning in February 1993. His brief was to lead Cupid through a series of acquisitions. However, this programme was never begun. In January, the company announced interim losses of Pounds 456,000 and said it was not clear whether it would return to profitability for the year. On Monday, however, it became clear that the losses would be substantial after provisions needed to restructure the bridal business. Cupid is not expected to replace Mr Shaw. It is understood that his responsibilities will be shared by Mr Stephen Riley, the finance director, and Mr Robert Devlin, managing director of the Pronuptia/Youngs business.</p>

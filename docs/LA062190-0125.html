			<p><P> June 21, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WESTERN WINGDING HELPS TRAUMA SOCIETY HIT PAY DIRT;  </P> <P> HUGS, HANDSHAKES AS 800 ATTEND  </P> <P> The Goldrush Camp at Knott's Berry Farm was the site of an Orange County Trauma  Society fund-raiser on Friday -- the fourth annual Western-themed wingding  hosted by the Associates, a support group founded and chaired by Virginia Knott  Bender.  </P> <P> More than 800 guests paid $75 each to mosey down the park paths to the tented  private party camp. The event raised an estimated $50,000 for accident  prevention and various educational programs.  </P> <P> Welcoming guests were Bender, her husband, Paul, Associates president Peggy  Goldwater Clay and OCTS founder Dr. John West.  </P> <P> After hugs and handshakes and backslaps -- you get to know your pardners pretty  well by the fourth benefit -- guests lit out for the hosted bars and the  big-as-a-barnyard open air dance floor.  </P> <P> Local rhinestone cowboys and cowgirls donned buffed boots, fringed jackets,  string ties and Stetsons -- as well as enough acid-washed blue jean material to  stretch from here to the Texas panhandle.  </P> <P> Janet and John Fossum enlisted about 60 summer clerks and attorneys from the  Newport Beach law firm where John works.  </P> <P> "Ginny and Paul (Bender) are longtime clients, so we like to be part of this,"  Fossum said. "And it's just a good party, you know?"  </P> <P> They knew out on the dance floor, where Don Thompson and Barbara Henry kicked  up their heels with Barbara Towne and Norm Fast -- the first foursome out there  two-steppin' and side-steppin' and generally looking like they knew what they  were doing.  </P> <P> Jeanne and Michael Keele got in on one of the line dances, as did Patty and Bob  George. Among the throng on the ever-widening sidelines were Jim Shaw and Susan  Barlow, who wore a gold-fringed leather jacket that looked like a cross between  Hells Angels duds and Annie Oakley gear.  </P> <P> Bob Harlan, a Newport Beach lawyer and president of OCTS, pushed his white  cowboy hat back on his head and said that trauma care in the county suffered a  blow earlier this year when one of the four trauma centers closed because of  lack of funds.  </P> <P> "Right now, we're focusing on getting more community interest" and raising  money, he said. The group is developing a new fund-raising program to attract  corporate sponsorship.  </P> <P> At sundown, guests lined up for a buffet fried-chicken dinner and a slice of  boysenberry pie. Then it was back to the dance floor or off into the wilds of  the amusement park.  </P></p>

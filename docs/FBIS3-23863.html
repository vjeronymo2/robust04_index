			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Fedor Yemchenko: "Resuscitation After the </F> Shock?"]    [Text] Replacement of certain of the actors in the  government has elicited an ambiguous reaction from those who  specialize in predictions. Some see in this a "recoil" from  market reforms, others--the beginning of the next period of  "shock-free therapy." Everyone assesses differently the  statement of Prime Minister V. Chernomyrdin to the effect that  the state must pay back its debts. Just think--the deed  (entirely natural, even obligatory) has not yet been done, and  the mere promise of its fulfillment has evoked such polarized  judgments. "Trillions are being shelled out to further develop  the `black hole' of agriculture," one central newspaper reported  a few days ago. But indeed, these trillions in question are not  being "shelled out." And this is not the charity of V.  Chernomyrdin and A. Zaveryukha, but rather a debt to the  farmers. We are already eating the final portions of the bread  procured from them last year. We paid for this--but to whom? Why  did the money not reach those who made the bread?    At the end of last year, the ideologues of stabilization  gladdened Russian hearts: Look, they said--we have already  curbed inflation, and the ruble is stronger. Just a little more,  a little bit more... But let us take a look at what stands  behind this report of victory. What has this "thrifty economics"  turned into for the producers?    My desk is covered with statements, appeals, and open  letters  to the president, prime minister, and ministries, which are  similar in tone. You become dumbfounded when you read them, and  wonder what state of deep crisis our production is in today.  Plants are standing idle. People have not received wages for  months. Workers are in a state of pre-strike frenzy.    It is not possible to enumerate everything. Let us consider  as an example just the key sectors. Once again the voices of our  country's miners are sounding the alarm. The coal miners' union  recently issued a statement which reads, in part: "Our trade  union has always strived to resolve complex problems of social  protection for the working people on the basis of mutual  understanding and cooperation with the government. However,  irresponsible promises by our partners in talks and their  infringement of the terms of the wage-scale agreement compel us  to take up a more rigid position."    The rigidity of this position is today manifest in the  active  preparation being made for demonstrations on the part of miners  in the Kuzbass, Vorkuta, Chita, and the Maritime Kray coal  fields. Once again the demands of the miners are "simple": The  state must pay back the 272 billion rubles it owes them from  last year. Delay in this regard may result in social upheaval.  Workers at several coal enterprises have still not received  their pay for...October! An interdepartmental commission on  socioeconomic problems of the coal producing regions created by  the government is doing nothing, according to trade union  leaders. Instead of developing a specific program, they are  engaging in empty debate.    A catastrophic situation has also come about at enterprises  of the oil and gas production industry. It turns out that the  "oil kings" are not wearing any clothes. The most profitable  sector in the country, one would think, providing huge amounts  of hard currency, is presently on the verge of coming to a halt.  Workers have not received their wages for three or four months.  And this is in Siberia, in the regions of the Far North!    From 18 through 24 January, all the general directors of the  oil and gas production and refining industries gathered together  with specialists from the Ministry of Fuel and Energy to develop  a program for extricating the sector out of its crisis. A  package of documents was prepared. Unfortunately, their authors  (as reported in the press) have not as yet been able to "get  through" to the prime minister to have these documents signed.    In the meantime, you and I have believed that in "shelling  out" significant portions of our wages at the gas pump, we have  thereby been ensuring normal labor and living conditions for our  oil producers. We pay conscientiously for our bread and  gasoline, but our money is not reaching those who produce all of  this.    For a long time, "shock therapy" was relatively forgiving to  metallurgists. But rapid price increases for energy and  increased rail transportation charges have brought this sector  to its knees as well. No halt is seen in the production decline.  Entire enterprises are shutting down.    A similar situation has come about at enterprises of the  shipbuilding industry, in the textile, machine-building, and  other commodity producing sectors.    The picture we see emerging here is an alarming one. There  is  cause for despair. So, should the government be criticized for  its attempt, albeit tardy, to rescue production from certain  collapse? And it is not "shock-free therapy" that our economy  needs today, but real resuscitation--without turning away from  the market, of course.</p>

			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / Inquiry spreads the blame for Credit Lyonnais losses A French parliamentary inquiry yesterday criticised ministers and leading civil servants as well as bank regulators and directors for allowing the state-owned Credit Lyonnais bank to run up record losses and bad debts. The National Assembly's nine-week investigation, led by its president, Mr Philippe Seguin, said that Mr Jean-Yves Haberer, who headed Credit Lyonnais from 1988 until his removal last November, 'carries the chief responsibility' for the bank's 'bulimic appetite for acquisitions, bad risk judgment, pursuance of relations with dubious clients, inadequate controls, and misjudgment of the business cycle'. But in calling for stricter management controls by the state and the Banking Commission, the report spreads wide the blame for giving free rein to Mr Haberer's banking ambitions and excesses. It also describes as 'astonishing' the government's decision not to dismiss Mr Haberer outright last summer when - by his own admission - Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister, had lost confidence in the Credit Lyonnais chief. Mr Haberer was instead shifted to another state banking post from which he was only removed in March on news of Credit Lyonnais's 1993 record loss of FFr6.9bn (Pounds 840m). Mr Alphandery told the inquiry the government had wanted to get rid of Mr Haberer gently so as not to destabilise Credit Lyonnais in particular and the Paris market in general. The report's publication has renewed calls for the Balladur government to carry out its eventual plan to privatise Credit Lyonnais. The relative speed with which the National Assembly has conducted its inquiry and the fact that it has not turned up any new skeletons may relieve the concern of Credit Lyonnais's new president, Mr Jean Peyrelevade, that his restructuring plans might be jeopardised. The Socialists who appointed Mr Haberer also seemed relieved yesterday at not coming in for more criticism from the conservative majority on the parliamentary inquiry. However, Mr Michel Sapin, a former Socialist finance minister, is criticised for re-appointing Mr Haberer to Credit Lyonnais in 1992. Mr Sapin now serves on the monetary policy committee of the Bank of France, whose governor, Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, is criticised for lax surveillance of the troubled bank when he was director of the French Treasury. In his report, Mr Seguin says the effectiveness of the state as Credit Lyonnais's shareholder was 'close to nil'. But the parliamentary report also takes the bank's 'independent' directors to task for failing to exercise any control on the Haberer management, and says only directors representing the bank's staff made any effort at control. The publication of the report coincided with the announcement of Credit Lyonnais's proposed sale of its controlling stake in Fnac, the largest music and books retailer in France, to Mr Francois Pinault, the entrepreneur who is a creditor of the bank and who recently joined its board as an independent director. Mr Pinault, whose family holdings control the Pinault-Printemps retail group, has agreed to pay FFr1.9bn for the 64.6 per cent stake in Fnac held by Altus, a subsidiary of Credit Lyonnais. The disposal is part of an aggressive programme of asset sales initiated by Mr Peyrelevade.

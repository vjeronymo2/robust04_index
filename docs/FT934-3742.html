			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / (CORRECTED) International Company News: Hoechst Correction (published 10th Decemeber 1993) appended to this article. A senior executive at Hoechst, the German chemical group, told a chemical industry conference in New York yesterday that the company would seek a listing for its shares on a US stock exchange some time after 1994. Hoechst will be following in the footsteps of Daimler-Benz, the German motor group, which in October became the first German company to list its shares on a US exchange. CORRECTION Hoechst, the German chemicals group, does not plan to seek a listing in New York some time after 1994, as wrongly indicated due to agency error on Tuesday.</p>

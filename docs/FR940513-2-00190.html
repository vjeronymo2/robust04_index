			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (2) First-hand connections with appropriate U.S. public and private sector organizations and institutions involved in legislative affairs; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The capacity to organize and manage international exchange programs, including appropriate orientation for the participants, handling of pre-departure arrangements and monitoring and problem-solving in such programs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> USIA is especially interested in multi-phase programs in which the phases build on one another and lay the groundwork for new and long-term relationships between American and African professionals. Proposals which are overly ambitious and those which are very general will not be competitive. Office of Citizen Exchanges grants are not given to support projects whose focus is limited to technical matters, or for scholarly research projects, developing publications for dissemination in the United States, individual student exchanges, film festivals, or exhibits. Neither does the Office of Citizen Exchanges provide scholarships or support for long-term (a semester or more) academic studies. Competitions sponsored by other Bureau offices are also announced in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> and may have different application requirements as well as different objectives.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Programming elements might include workshops or seminars overseas led by American experts, a study tour in the U.S. for selected African participants, U.S.-based internships, and specialized American consultancies overseas. A planning visit overseas by the American organizer can also be considered if crucial to successful development and implementation of the program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Selection of Participants <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The U.S.-based phase of the project should be designed for legislative staff from Benin, Cote d'Ivoire, Mali and Niger, probably totalling about 12 persons. Participants should have professional responsibilities related to the operation of the national legislature. USIS personnel overseas will select the African participants, although recommendations from the grantee institution are welcome. USIS offices will facilitate the issuance of visas and can also help with the distribution of program-related materials to African participants. Two U.S. State Department interpreters and one escort officer will be available for a U.S. study tour. For the program phases in Africa, the grantee institution will select the American presenters in consultation with USIA. American presenters conducting in-country activities should be French-fluent. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

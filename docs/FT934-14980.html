			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / Anti-trust extension 'could increase conflict with UK' A US Supreme Court ruling that extends US anti-trust laws to the activities of London-based reinsurers could lead to increased conflict between the UK and the US, a British trade official has warned. At the end of June the Supreme Court ruled that US courts had jurisdiction over alleged collusive action between reinsurers at Lloyd's and US primary insurers, even though the alleged behaviour of the Lloyd's underwriters conformed to the UK's insurance regulatory regime. Mr Edmund Hosker, who is based at the British embassy in Washington, told the International Bar Association meeting in New Orleans that the most troubling aspect of the decision was that it was a retreat from a previous position, which required US courts to balance the competing interests of jurisdictions involved before assuming jurisdiction itself. There had been conflict between the US and UK over anti-trust issues before, most noticeably the Westinghouse uranium case in the 1970s which resulted in the UK's passing a blocking statute to reduce the impact of US anti-trust laws on UK companies. Mr Hosker said he feared the Supreme Court decision would encourage state authorities and private plaintiffs in the US to launch anti-trust cases against foreign companies over activities which were entirely acceptable under their own regulatory regimes. 'I fear it may also reduce the incentive to co-operate with US regulatory authorities in the anti-trust sphere and could result in foreign governments making wider use of blocking statutes,' he said. The Supreme Court had indicated there was not a conflict between the UK and US in the reinsurance case, but the British government had made it clear in three amicus briefs filed with the courts that restrictions on UK reinsurers operating in US markets did create a conflict. 'If the position is reversed it is difficult to see the US not complaining,' he said. Mr Hosker said the only way to limit potential for conflict was to continue efforts to increase co-operation between US and UK competition authorities. Ms Diane Wood, the US deputy assistant attorney general for trade policy, said Mr Hosker was exaggerating the potential for conflict over the issue. There were always going to be overlaps of jurisdiction, she said, but that did not necessarily mean an increase in conflict.</p>

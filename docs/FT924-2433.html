			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Letter: More than one way to market Sir, Your leader, 'Going to Market' (December 1), links the UK's emphasis on equity rather than debt finance with the UK's 'infrastructure devoted to bringing firms to market - accountants, merchant banks, stockbrokers'. This is a perceptive commentary but does not do justice to the UK's thriving management consultancy industry which is devoted to getting the best mix of finance for its clients rather than just placing equity. In one of our recent projects, a mixed team of financial and telecommunications specialists arranged financing for an east European country's national telecommunications infrastructure development. No equity finance was involved, only a start-up loan equivalent to 1 per cent of the country's annual gross domestic product.

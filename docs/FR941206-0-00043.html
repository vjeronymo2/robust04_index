Therefore, the Director approves the revisions pertaining to cash and government bonds as forms of collateral bond at Rule 1.04(25). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> b. Rules 1.04(25), 3.02.4(1)(b), and 3.02.4(2)(c)(ix), Disallowance of the Use of Real Property as a Form of Collateral Bond <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Colorado proposed to revise the definition of ``collateral bond'' at Rule 1.04(25) and the conditions applicable to collateral bonds at Rules 3.02.4(1)(b) and 3.02.4(2)(c)(ix) by deleting language referring to a perfected first-lien security interest in real property located in Colorado. The effect of these deletions is to disallow real property as an allowable form of collateral bond in the Colorado program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Federal definition of ``collateral bond'' at 30 CFR 800.5(b)(5) provides that a perfected, first-lien security interest in real property, in favor of the regulatory authority, may be used to support a collateral bond. The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.21(c) set forth the conditions applicable to the use of real property as collateral bond. The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 730.11(b) also provide, however, that State laws and regulations may be more stringent and environmentally protective than the corresponding Federal regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In this case, Colorado's proposed deletion, at Rules 1.04(25), 3.02.4(1)(b), and 3.02.4(2)(c)(ix), of the use of real property to support a collateral bond would make these proposed rules more stringent than the corresponding Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.5(b)(5) and 800.21(c) because Colorado would allow only cash and other financial instruments that have a fairly constant and readily ascertainable value to be used to support a collateral bond. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by V.A. Bukarov, Yu.S. Sedov, Yu.S. Ishchenko, </F> NIKIMT Scientific Production Association; UDC  621.791.754:621.643.1/.2]    [Abstract] The stringent requirements imposed on the toxic  substance concentration in process media transported mostly over  electrochemically polished stainless steel pipes which are  usually fabricated by gas-shielded nonconsumable electrode  welding prompted the development of comprehensive support for  pipe welding in clean rooms. The equipment and machine tool  attachments necessary for ensuring the requisite welded joint  quality from the viewpoint of protecting the weld metal and heat  affected area (ZTV) from oxidation are outlined in detail. The  Kama-1 pipe welding head developed, manufactured, and tested by  the NIKIMT Scientific Production Association for welding small  diameter pipes (5-14 mm) and its successor--the Kama-2 head--are  described and their specifications are cited. Equipment for the  ER-273 power supply unit for single- and multiple-pass wedding,  a TV endoscope, ODA welding head attachments, and a manual pipe  cutter developed by the association are described and their  technical data are summarized. All above equipment can be stored  in a specially designed transportable case. Figures 6; tables 2.</p>

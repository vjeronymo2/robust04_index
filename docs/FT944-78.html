			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / On The Front Line: Kim Jong-il puzzle - War and Peace (Warmongers and Peacemakers) When North Korea threatened to withdraw from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty in March 1993, Kim Jong-il, the 52-year-old son and heir of President Kim Il-sung, took public responsibility for the act that precipitated an international crisis over Pyongyang's nuclear programme. Analysts debated the motives behind the decision. Some believed that North Korea was fearful that the International Atomic Energy Agency would discover the country's nuclear weapons capability as inspections became more intrusive. Others saw the action as a desperate attempt by an isolated and ailing North Korea to gain diplomatic recognition and economic aid from the US in return for its compliance with nuclear safeguards. Another explanation was that Kim needed to build his credibility as a strong leader and refute criticism by domestic rivals that he was not fit to succeed his charismatic father as the country's new head. After 18 months of tense diplomatic brinkmanship, Kim has apparently succeeded in achieving all these goals. Under an agreement reached with the US in October, North Korea was promised diplomatic ties with Washington and badly-needed energy supplies to revive its crippled economy in exchange for dismantling its current nuclear programme and accepting safer light-water reactors provided by an international consortium. Moreover, North Korea won as much as five years' breathing space before the IAEA is allowed access to several facilities that could disclose the full extent of the country's past nuclear activity. The deal, which was concluded three months after the death of his father, has also bolstered Kim's reputation. But it is still uncertain why he has not yet formerly succeeded his father as general secretary of the ruling Korean Workers' party and national president. North Korea is reaping other benefits from the agreement, including exploratory visits by foreign businessmen seeking to invest in the country. What is extraordinary is that the country, which had a very poor hand to play, was able to gain such results. Pyongyang, using bluff and intimidation, played on regional fears that if it was pushed too far, it would lash out. The US found that it lacked support from its Asian allies for a policy of confrontation, such as economic sanctions. The only realistic alternative was offering concessions to North Korea to persuade it to adhere to nuclear safeguards. Nonetheless, the nuclear deal could still become unstuck. North Korea has so far refused to resume political dialogue with South Korea, although it promised to do so under the accord. Pyongyang is hoping to isolate Seoul from its US ally in the same way that South Korea successfully weakened Russian and Chinese support for North Korea in the early 1990s. Continued refusal to negotiate with Seoul could jeopardise the agreement. The recent downing of a US army helicopter over North Korea has also cast at least a temporary shadow over the deal. More significantly, the agreement poses a potential threat to Kim's government in spite of the gains that it offers. The infusion of foreign investment and influence into North Korea's closed society could eventually undermine public support for the rigidly authoritarian state. Even if the nuclear agreement proceeds smoothly, Kim will still be engaged in a delicate balancing act to open his country without provoking social unrest.</p>

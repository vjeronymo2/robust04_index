			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / India opens up economy with radical budget INDIA'S industry and financial markets yesterday welcomed a budget which makes clear that the country remains on track to implement the most radical changes in economic policy since it became independent in 1949. The budget marks the first substantial reduction in India's foreign exchange controls, a milestone in opening-up the country's protected economy. As part of an effort to deter gold smuggling, the government also intends to legalise the import of gold - allowing returning Indians or expatriate Indians to bring as passengers up to 5kg each. The Bombay stock market climbed 173 points on Saturday after the budget to pass the 3,000 mark in late trading. That represents a 60 per cent rise since the beginning of the year. Mr Tarun Das, director of the Confederation of Engineering Industries, said: 'The budget is giving us confidence. I see no minus points.' However, the political opposition attacked the budget for doing little for the bulk of India's 850m people and for bowing to international financial institutions which have been demanding a reduction in the country's budget deficit. India concluded a letter of intent with the International Monetary Fund last year, agreeing to a gradual but radical overhaul of the state-dominated economy in return for substantial credits. India's foreign debt stands at about Dollars 70bn (Pounds 39.8bn). Mr L K Advani, who as head of the Hindu BJP party is leader of the opposition, said the measures lacked any worthwhile strategy to combat inflation. Among the changes announced by Dr Manmohan Singh, finance minister, were: The partial convertibility of the rupee. Permission for foreign pension funds to make direct portfolio investments in India. The abolition of controls on Indian companies raising equity funds in the domestic market. A rationalisation of the income tax structure to provide three basic rates of payment - 20, 30 and 40 per cent. Holders of foreign exchange will be allowed to change 60 per cent of their foreign currency at a market rate. The remaining 40 per cent must be changed at the official rate. The move will mean about a 9 per cent depreciation of the rupee against the dollar. The foreign exchange market in India will remain closed today Dr Singh told parliament that the budget deficit had been reduced from 8.4 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 1990-91 to 6.5 per cent in the current financial year and would fall to 5 per cent in 1992-93. He said the cut in the budget deficit was the most important factor in curbing inflation, which remains at 12 per cent - or higher than Dr Singh had projected when he presented his first budget in July. The budget foresees the fiscal deficit for 1992-93 falling by 10 per cent to Rs338.9bn. Total expenditure would rise by only 5 per cent (or substantially below the inflation rate) to Rs1,190 bn. A large chunk of the increase in expenditure is accounted for by a 17 per cent rise in interest payments on government debt. Among long-term changes announced was a reduction in customs duties as part of a lowering of India's large protective barriers. Dr Singh said that tariff duties - reduced from a peak of 150 per cent to 110 per cent - would be brought down over three to four years to levels comparable with those in other industrialising developing countries.</p>

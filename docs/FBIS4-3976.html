			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 28 (XINHUA) -- China will continue to  make efforts to promote Hong Kong's economic development and  improve people's living there, Wu jianmin, Chinese Foreign  Ministry spokesman, said here today.    He told a weekly news briefing here this afternoon that the  two panels of the Preliminary Working Committee (PWC) for the  Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative  Region in charge of political and economic affairs will meet in  Hong Kong from May 2-3 and from May 4-5, respectively.    Lu Ping, PWC deputy director and secretary-general, will  head  mainland members of the two panels and other personnel of the  PWC Secretariat to attend the meetings in Hong Kong, he said.    While in Hong Kong, Lu will listen to advice and proposals  from the Hong Kong people, he said.    "The Chinese side has always been greatly concerned with the  economic affairs and people's livelihood of Hong Kong," he  noted. "We have already made efforts, and will continue to do  so, in order to promote Hong Kong's economic prosperity and  improve the people's livelihood there," he stated.    He said that China hopes to maintain cooperative relations  with the British side in this regard.    Whether or not the cooperation will go smoothly depends  entirely on the attitude and actions of the British side, Wu  added.</p>

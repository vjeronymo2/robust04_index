			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / International Company News: Varig loss doubles to Dollars 245m Varig, the Brazilian airline, reported a loss of Dollars 245m for the first half of 1994, more than double the Dollars 117m deficit for the same period last year. Brazil's economic problems, continued high operating expenses and leasing and interest costs were largely responsible for the deterioration, Varig said. Varig launched a financial restructuring in March, suspending payments on 50 leased aircraft and returning five, and renegotiating lease agreements. It also announced the loss of 2,600 jobs. However, in the first half of the year the company's financial costs increased by Dollars 24m, to Dollars 145m, compared with the same period last year, while flight operating costs increased by Dollars 59m, to Dollars 695m. Varig also highlighted an exchange-rate loss of Dollars 37m, caused by the appreciation of the yen against the dollar. On Tuesday the company, which is controlled by an employees' foundation, announced it would be offering seats on its board to creditors General Electric and McDonnell Douglas in return for help in restructuring a Dollars 600m Eximbank-financed debt. It will also offer a seat to a representative of its Brazilian creditor banks, to which it owes about Dollars 250m in short- term financing. According to Varig, the restructuring measures will represent annual savings of Dollars 300m by 1996. The company says it is making an operating profit on its domestic routes, where it has a 50 per cent market share, but is losing money on international flights due to overcapacity and fierce competition from US airlines.</p>

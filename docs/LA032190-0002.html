			<p><P> March 21, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NAMIBIA: MAJOR U.N. ACHIEVEMENT  </P> <P> Africa's last colony, Namibia, became free today, setting a new standard for a  smooth and constructive transition to democracy.  </P> <P> The achievement is the work of many, most important the United Nations, which  has overseen 33 years of decolonization in Africa. It was the United Nations  that developed the plan to free Namibia, prodded South Africa to abandon its  illegal hold on the territory, organized the repatriation of 40,000 exiles,  supervised the election and now will help coordinate the assistance that will  be necessary for years to come. Other remarkable contributions have come from  both black and white political leaders of Namibia, none more influential than  Sam Nujoma. It was he who led the South-West Africa People's Organization in  its long war of resistance to South African control, and then won a stunning  election victory to become leader of the new nation. He used his power to  develop consensus, resulting in a constitution based on multiple parties and a  market-oriented economy.  </P> <P> The United States has had a special role. It was President Woodrow Wilson who  devised a trusteeship under the League of Nations that ended German control of  Namibia (then known as South-West Africa) at the end of World War I. Donald F.  McHenry, while deputy U.S. representative to the U.N. Security Council, played  a key part in drafting the 1978 U.N. plan for independence. The role was more  controversial after 1980, as the Reagan Administration linked independence to  the withdrawal of Cuban troops from neighboring Angola and, with its policy of  "constructive engagement," may have encouraged the obstinacy of South Africa.  But ultimately the State Department played a central role in negotiating South  Africa's agreement to free the vast territory.  </P> <P> In Namibia, as in another neighboring nation, Zimbabwe, the black majority has  exercised moderation and treated the white minority with respect. It is a model  that could help South Africa chart its new course to majority rule. It is a  model that could inspire all the nations of Africa.  </P></p>

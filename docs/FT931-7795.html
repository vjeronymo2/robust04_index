			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / India's president calls for national unity MR Shankar Dayal Sharma, India's president, yesterday condemned attempts to exploit inter-religious tensions for political ends and appealed for a campaign to promote national calm and unity. 'The most important task before us today is to restore confidence and communal amity shaken by the tragic events of December 6 last year (when the Ayodhya mosque was destroyed) and what followed thereafter,' the president said on the opening day of a new parliament. He spoke amid rising tension over plans by the radical Hindu Bharatiya Janata party for a rally in New Delhi on Thursday, defying a government ban. The BJP, whose supporters set off nationwide inter-religious violence by sacking the Ayodhya mosque, yesterday boycotted parliament over the arrest of some of the thousands of demonstrators en route to the capital. The police have reinforced checkpoints at New Delhi's borders and have orders to stop demonstrators. The BJP has meanwhile told supporters to hold gatherings in their home towns and urging others to breach the cordons and attend the rally in New Delhi. BJP MPs yesterday demonstrated outside parliament against the government ban, which Mr LK Advani, the party leader, condemned as harking back to the emergency rule imposed in the 1970s by Mrs Indira Gandhi. The row over the planned rally has overshadowed the 1993-94 budget, to be presented by Mr Manmohan Singh, finance minister, on Saturday. It will give the government a chance to try to put economic reform back at the centre of its agenda. But the likelihood of immediate success is small, given the passions aroused by the religious conflict.</p>

			<p><P> October 11, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> KLAN BARRED FROM PLAYING PHONE TAPES;  </P> <P> COURTS: JUDGE RULES THE RACIST MESSAGES INFRINGE ON 'MISTER ROGERS' TRADEMARKS.  </P> <P> The Missouri Knights of the Ku Klux Klan must stop playing racist telephone  recordings that imitate the "Mister Rogers" children's television show, a  federal judge has ruled.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge Howard F. Sachs on Wednesday also ordered the Klan and  three of its alleged members to turn over tape recordings and other materials  that lawyers for the program say infringe on its trademarks and copyrights.  </P> <P> Sachs issued the temporary restraining order one day after Fred M. Rogers and  his Family Communications Inc. sued to stop the Klan's use of the recording.  The message imitates the sound effects and song of the "Mister Rogers"  television show and Rogers' voice and speech patterns.  </P> <P> "The messages are of racism, white supremacy and bigotry -- the antithesis of  everything Rogers and Family Communications Inc. stand for," said Cynthia E.  Kernick, a lawyer for Rogers from Pittsburgh.  </P> <P> A group of civil rights, community and religious leaders complained last week  that the number for a telephone in Independence that played the racist message  had been circulated among elementary and middle school students in the  metropolitan area.  </P> <P> The same phone number was used earlier this year to promote the philosophy of  the Missouri Knights of the Klan.  </P> <P> The lawsuit names the Klan and Adam Troy Mercer of Independence; Michael  Brooks, also known as M. B. Madison, of Kansas City, and Edward E. Stephens,  also of Kansas City.  </P> <P> Attempts to reach Mercer, Madison and Stephens were unsuccessful.  </P> <P> The judge set a hearing on a preliminary injunction for Oct. 20.  </P></p>

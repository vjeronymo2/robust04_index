			<p><P> November 10, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NO U.S. AID FOR GERMANY YET -- BAKER  </P> <P> Secretary of State James A. Baker III said today that despite the dramatic  moves in East Germany toward free travel, substantial Western aid for that  country is unlikely until there is "political pluralism across the board."  </P> <P> "There's a long way to go before there is true freedom and true political  pluralism in East Germany," Baker said from Washington on ABC's "Good Morning  America." "That doesn't mean we don't welcome this step."  </P> <P> In Moscow, Soviet spokesman Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov  welcomed East Germany's decision to throw open its borders but stressed that  the border between East and West Germany remains in force and that eased travel  restrictions should not be taken as heralding the imminent reunification of the  two Germanys.  </P> <P> "The border still remains, though some might think it ceased to exist," he  said.  </P> <P> He added that the Soviet Union is concerned about the instability brought on by  the mass exodus of East Germans to the West.  </P> <P> But with easier travel, Gerasimov said, "the wanderlust the Germans are famous  for will go down because now, when you know you can go, maybe you'll postpone  the decision."  </P> <P> Baker, although calling the open borders "the most dramatic event in East-West  relations" since the end of World War II, said the United States and other  allies believe any discussion of an aid program now would be premature.  </P> <P> The allies, he said, will be much more forthcoming about helping East Germany  only if there is "political pluralism across the board."  </P> <P> The only action taken by the Bush Administration has been an offer of "all  possible assistance" to the West German government as it struggles to cope with  the flood of refugees. The Pentagon said it was making available housing for  980 people in three off-base installations.  </P> <P> "Were we surprised by the speed of it?" Baker asked in a separate interview on  CBS. "You bet your life, and so was everybody else as far as I can determine."  </P> <P> "It is not enough . . . simply to open borders," Sen. Claiborne Pell (D-R.I.),  chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said in a statement.  </P> <P> "East Germany should also hold truly democratic elections so that its people  can have a secure and free future without having to leave their homes," Pell  said.  </P> <P> Sen. Richard G. Lugar (R-Ind.), a former Foreign Relations Committee chairman,  said the Administration should be cautious. The East German authorities, he  said, may be intent on getting rid of "the bad eggs" before moving to restore  the hard-line system.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cape Town May 23 SAPA -- President Nelson Mandela  and home affairs minister Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi held talks  on Monday morning on the KwaZulu land issue and the appointment  of the KwaZulu/Natal provincial cabinet, a spokesman for the  president's office said.    Press spokesman Mr Joel Netshitenzhe said at 10.30 that the  meeting -- at Mr Mandela's official residence Westbrooke --  "should be over by now". The two men had talked for about  one-and-a-half hours, he said. As far as he knew, deputy  president Mr FW de Klerk had not been present. The intention  was not to issue a press statement before the cabinet meeting  due to start at 11AM.    Earlier, minister of land affairs Mr Derek Hanekom cancelled  a press conference scheduled for Monday so that the president  and cabinet could discuss the KwaZulu land issue before he was  asked to answer any further questions on it. A spokesman for  his office said the press conference, set up early last week,  was to have dealt with land restitution. After the KwaZulu land  issue hit the headlines questions on it at the press conference  were unavoidable. "Mr Hanekom would not like to comment until  we hear something from the president," she said.    Last week the ANC in KwaZulu/Natal asked to be excused from  proceedings in the provincial cabinet after expressing  dissatisfaction with the ministerial portfolios allocated to it.  Provincial premier Dr Frank Mdladlose said a meeting to discuss  the issue had been called for Tuesday.    It was also reported last week that the day before former  President de Klerk was voted out of office, he ceded control  over some three million hectares of KwaZulu state land to a  trust headed by King Goodwill Zwelethini. ANC leaders in Natal  were enraged by the move, calling it a "deal made behind the  people's backs".</p>

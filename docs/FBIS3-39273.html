[Deschelotte] The provisional arrangement is not  satisfactory, insofar as the threshold of four percent (of the  CA [turnover]) for indirect public assistance allowed the United  States is generous. This system, which is difficult to control,  also makes major financing efforts possible.    [LE QUOTIDIEN] What solutions do you envision?    [Deschelotte] The European governments must become aware of  the need to adapt the financing system to international  conditions. Since it is impossible to control the United States,  let us adopt their indirect aid system. This type of aid is not  necessarily the most efficient economically, but, on the other  hand, it is better adapted to the Anglo-Saxon rules of the GATT.  And this is no accident, moreover, because it is the Americans  who shaped the spirit of the GATT. What is needed is to abandon  "vertical" aid and the project by project approach in favor of  the horizontal financing of research projects.    Another type of aid can be envisioned in the form of  purchases by the governments that support us with military or  tanker versions of the Airbus. This would enable us to find new  outlets and to amortize our production.    [LE QUOTIDIEN] What is the state of mind, at present, on one  side of the Atlantic and the other?  [Deschelotte] The European governments are beginning to become  aware of what is at stake. This was urgently needed, because the  nefarious effects resulting from the current distortions will  not be visible until we are truly lagging behind the Americans.</p>

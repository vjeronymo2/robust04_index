			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Margins squeezed as Pochin's drops 38% POCHIN'S, the building, plant hire and property group, saw pre-tax profits tumble 38 per cent, from Pounds 2.46m to Pounds 1.53m, over the 12 months to May 31. The pressure on margins was underlined by the group's turnover, which, boosted by a large design and build contract, expanded some 42 per cent to Pounds 46.6m. Mr Nicholas Pochin, chairman, said: 'The long awaited and much heralded recovery is still a figment of the imagination within our industry. 'Capacity far exceeds demand resulting in extreme competitive pressure on prices,' he said. Nevertheless, investment and rental income was described as 'healthy'. The group had retained all its tenants, Mr Pochin said. 'All things considered, I believe that the pint pot is half full rather than half empty,' he stated. The recommended final dividend is held at 21p for a maintained total of 29p, covered nearly 3.5 times by earnings of 100.2p (167.6p) per share.</p>

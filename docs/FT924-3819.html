			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Jobless fall lifts hopes of US recovery THE US unemployment rate fell to 7.2 per cent last month from 7.4 per cent in October and a peak of 7.8 per cent in June, indicating that a steady, but not spectacular, economic recovery is under way. At the same time, the Labour Department said employment in the non-agricultural sector rose 105,000 to 108.6m, more than most analysts expected. Figures for previous months were revised up to reveal a net gain of more than 300,000 private-sector jobs since the beginning of the year. On Wall Street the figures were seen as reducing the chance of a big fiscal stimulus next year, although the incoming Clinton administration is still likely to unveil a modest package of measures, including an investment tax credit and an acceleration of infrastructure spending. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 12.15 to 3,288.68. The dollar rose on the news, as analysts discounted the chance of any further cuts in US short-term interest rates. However, with inflationary pressures modest, the Federal Reserve is not expected to tighten monetary policy for many months. The dollar gained more than a pfennig to DM1.5930. Officials cautioned that the employment figures were less strong than they appeared: up to 45,000 of the new jobs reflected temporary jobs at polling stations. Manufacturing employment rose 35,000, but this followed net job losses of 200,000 in the previous three months. The construction and retailing sectors shed jobs. Some regions, moreover, remain depressed. The unemployment rate in California rose to 10.1 per cent last month against 9.8 per cent in October. The employment report was the latest in a series of improved statistics, including sharp gains in consumer confidence, factory orders, labour productivity and the Purchasing Managers' Index - which tracks conditions in manufacturing. Monetary growth and bank lending are also beginning to pick up. The likely pace of the recovery is disputed but few analysts expect the annualised growth rate of 3.9 per cent reported for the third quarter to be sustained in coming months. This reflected many special factors, including a decline in personal savings and some involuntary rebuilding of inventories by companies. The much slower pace of job creation than in previous economic recoveries is widely expected to constrain growth of incomes and personal spending. Analysts also warn that US exports, surprisingly resilient to date, are likely to suffer as other big economies, such as Japan and Germany, slip into recession. Canada's unemployment rate rose sharply last month to 11.8 per cent from 11.3 per cent in October, Reuter reports from Ottawa. The jobless rate was the highest since July 1983.</p>

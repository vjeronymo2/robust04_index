			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Taiwanese vote to settle their island's identity: Divisions over whether Taiwan will seek to be a Chinese province or a sovereign state Taiwanese voters will cast a ballot for the island's identity as much as for cleaner streets in local elections early next month. The long-ruling Nationalist party, or Kuomintang (KMT), is marshalling all the considerable forces at its disposal to maintain control of the two biggest cities and a governorship on the island it officially calls a province of China - the Republic of China, that is, not the People's Republic of China. The KMT, which retreated to Taiwan in 1949 after defeat at the hands of Mao Zedong's communist armies, now faces a formidable challenge to its political survival in the shape of the Democratic Progressive party, which advocates an independent Taiwan. It also suffered from attrition when disaffected conservative KMT members broke away to form the New Party last year. Ironically, old foes have become allies as the Nationalists have been aided in their electoral campaign by Chinese officials, who have in recent days reiterated Beijing's longstanding threat to use force against Taiwan should circumstances warrant. President Jiang Zemin yesterday reportedly told US President Bill Clinton at the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation forum in Jakarta that if Taiwanese authorities declare independence, China would certainly not stand by and do nothing. Next month's polls represent the penultimate stage in a process of democratisation which began in the mid-1980s, marked by successive elections starting from the lowest levels of government and culminating in direct presidential elections in early 1996. In the December 3 elections, voters will for the first time choose mayors for the cities of Taipei and Kaohsiung, where about a quarter of Taiwan's 21m residents live, and a governor for Taiwan province, comprised of territory other than the two cities and a few outlying islands. The posts were previously appointed. Should a DPP candidate win, it would be the first time the leading opposition party would have captured a significant administrative post. The KMT accuses the DPP of being irresponsible and incapable of governing, while the DPP says the ruling party is irredeemably corrupt and inefficient. The Taipei mayoral seat is widely expected to go to Mr Chen Shui-bian, a popular DPP lawmaker in Taiwan's Legislative Yuan, or parliament. Mr Wu Dun-yih, the KMT incumbent, is seen likely to retain the mayorship of Kaohsiung. But it is the symbolically significant post of provincial governor which is especially critical to the KMT, and it has spared no expense in drawing on its vast financial resources to ensure victory for the incumbent candidate, Mr James Soong. Mr Soong is one of the few remaining top Taiwanese politicians to have been born in mainland China, the others having been shunted out of the KMT's mainstream faction in recent years. The KMT cannot afford to lose the provincial governorship poll because it is seen as a referendum on the identity of Taiwan and future relations with China. The KMT says Taiwan is a province of China and supports eventual reunification with China under condition of peace and democracy on both sides of Taiwan Strait. The DPP says Taiwan is not a Chinese province but an independent nation and thus the entire provincial government structure is redundant and should be abolished. The KMT also fears that if the DPP wins control of the provincial government, which administers three-quarters of the island's territory and population, something analogous to the 'Yeltsin effect' could materialise, at least in theory - a reference to how the power of the head of the Russian republic eclipsed that of the leader of the former Soviet Union. Political analysts say that a win by the DPP's candidate, Mr Chen Ting-nan, would pose an indirect threat to the legitimacy of the president himself, as he was in effect installed by a rubber-stamp parliament rather than popular mandate. In practice, President Lee Teng-hui enjoys enormous popular support, even among many DPP members, because he is a native Taiwanese and it is widely believed that he secretly favours the island's independence. As the polling day draws nearer, the KMT will likely play the 'president card', in the parlance of the local media, and bring Mr Lee on an extensive tour of the island to win votes. The same strategy helped carry the KMT to victory in islandwide polls a year ago which the DPP was predicted to win.</p>

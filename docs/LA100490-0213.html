			<p><P> October 4, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> MONACO REMAINS IN MOURNING  </P> <P> The flag atop the royal palace flew at half-staff today as Monaco mourned the  death of Princess Caroline's husband, Stefano Casiraghi, 30, in a speedboat  accident.  </P> <P> Several of the racers competing against Casiraghi in the World Offshore  Championships said he was driving too fast Wednesday to handle the choppy water  on the course. His boat somersaulted backward, and he was killed instantly.  </P> <P> Residents of the principality, but not tourists, were allowed to file past  Casiraghi's body in a mortuary near the Princess Grace hospital. He lay in a  simple, brass-handled mahogany coffin, still wearing the red-and-white racing  suit in which he died while defending his world title. There was a slight cut  under one eye.  </P></p>

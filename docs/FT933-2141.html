			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / Greek Elections: Papandreou opens campaign MR Andreas Papandreou, the Greek opposition leader, has opened his election campaign with the old-fashioned political rhetoric his supporters like to hear. He promised to raise living standards and provide full employment if his Panhellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok) returns to power at the October 10 general election. Over 100,000 Pasok supporters crowded the Thessaloniki waterfront at the weekend to hear the former premier speak enthusiastically, if vaguely, of 'policies that will lead to development, policies that will provide social protection.' Opinion polls give Pasok a a small overall majority in a new electoral law that favours the front-running party. Yet much will depend on Mr Papandreou's ability to convince floating voters he is fit enough to be prime minister again. There can be no doubting Mr Papandreou's capacity to make a political comeback. He has survived open-heart surgery, held on to the Pasok leadership despite three successive election defeats, and been acquitted of charges of corruption while in office. Now 75, he makes few public appearances and his speeches are shorter than they used to be. He keeps a tight grip on Pasok as there is no obvious candidate to challenge him for the leadership. None of the six personalities mentioned as likely successors to Mr Papandreou seem to command support from all Pasok's factions. However, Mr Papandreou's reluctance to co-operate with potential rivals means policy is made in a vacuum. Ask a prominent party economist how a socialist government would cope with Greece's widening public sector deficit and the answer is as vague as any of Mr Papandreou's campaign promises. The conservative New Democracy party's election tactic is to provoke Mr Papandreou into being specific. He has said he does not intend to devalue the drachma, but refuses to be drawn on how a Pasok government might cover the revenue shortfall that would result from cancelling the privatisation programme. Still, the socialists say they are committed to steadily reducing inflation and the public sector deficit so Greece can achieve economic convergence with the rest of the European Community by the year 2000.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] San Cristobal de las Casas (Mexico), 28 Jun (EFE) --  At least two immigration officials were killed in an attack on  an border post in Chiapas State by a new group calling itself  the People's National Liberation Movement [Movimiento Popular de  Liberacion Nacional -- MPLN], state authorities reported today.    According to sources in the Attorney General's Office, the  attack took place at 0400 (1000 GMT) in the municipality of  Mazapa de Madero, 10 km from the Guatemalan border. The rebel  Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN) has its base of  operations in the northwestern region of Chiapas, some 150 km  from this area.    Authorities have begun investigating the killing of the two  immigration officials, Luis Alonso Cordova, 46, and Lindolfo de  Leon Castillo, 37. After the two were killed, their bodies were  burned along with the outpost and two vehicles.    The authorities confirmed the area has been cordoned off  since 1500 by members of the Army's 25th Infantry Battalion,  which is based in the town of Motozintla, some 10 km west of the  site of the attack. A placard was found near the area with a  slogan painted in red: "We do not want any more clowning around  with your electoral circus -- MPLN." Some 10 km from there,  another placard was found with a slogan that read: "If the  government does not fulfill its promises here and there, the  struggle will continue -- MPLN."    According to Jose Santiago Garcia, mayor of Mazapa de  Madero,  the attack could have been staged by groups of drug traffickers  or by traffickers of illegal Central American aliens who operate  in the region.    The Interior Secretariat has asked the relevant authorities  to conduct investigations to find those responsible for this  criminal action. Up to now, the existence of this guerrilla  group was not known. Authorities have been unable to confirm if  the attack was carried out by guerrillas or by criminals linked  to drug trafficking.    Last week, the self-styled Mexican Southeastern  Revolutionary  Peasants and Workers Front announced its demands. It threatened  to stage an uprising if it was not included in the peace talks  between the EZLN and representatives of President Carlos Salinas  de Gortari's government.</p>

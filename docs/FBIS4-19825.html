			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Bosnia/Italy: Andreatta to Kozyrev: </F> `We Count on Russian Influence'"]    [Text] (ANSA) Rome, April 18 -- Italian Foreign Minister  Beniamino Andreatta has today sent an urgent message concerning  the dramatic events underway in Gorazde to his Russian  counterpart Andrey Kozyrev, a Farnesina [Foreign Ministry]  communique said this evening.    In the letter, Andreatta recalled recent bilateral  consultations in Budapest and underscored the urgent need to see  to it that all the efforts of the entire international community  converge so as to head off the humanitarian catastrophe that  United Nations' bodies in Bosnia are warning of.    The immediate goal to pursue, he said, was a cease-fire  coupled with the withdrawal to a sufficient distance of Serbian  troops from the city of Gorazde.    Furthermore, maximum impetus must be given to efforts to get  negotiations underway lest they lose both their credibility and  effectiveness, the Italian diplomatic chief continued.    The Serbian side, too, should be aware of this and "we count  heavily on Russian influence to make this happen," Andreatta  said in the message.    At this point, the Italian minister reminded his Russian  counterpart of Italy's commitment to the search of suitable  formulas to charge up the process of international  consultations, starting with the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina.  "A process which should reflect substantial, decisive  contributions," and to which the Russian Federation, "with its  prestige and its political weight", could greatly contribute, he  said.</p>

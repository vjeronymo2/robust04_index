			<p><P> June 11, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> It's tacky, tacky, tacky for NBC to show the preempted episodes of "Miami Vice"  after the series-ending episode on May 21. This is like the Dodgers playing  rained-out games after the World Series! Like George Bush giving campaign  speeches after the election! Like "The Winds of War" showing the last episode  before the middle episodes!  </P> <P> It's very thoughtless of NBC to show "Miami Vice" out of sequence. And it's not  very nice. "Miami Vice" used to be a big hit for NBC and it's a shame the  network is letting the show go out in a schlocky fashion.  </P> <P> Linda Cowan Mose, Sherman Oaks  </P></p>

			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Gotti aide tells court of Mafia secrets US prosecutors hope to make more progress in the battle against organised crime following revelations about the structure of the Mafia by a top-ranking member of the Gambino family, the biggest crime 'family' in the US. The revelations came during testimony in the Brooklyn trial of Mr John Gotti, the reputed Mafia head of the Gambino family, who is known as the 'Dapper Don'. Mr Gotti, who has escaped conviction in three earlier trials, is accused of ordering five murders, extortion, illegal gambling and obstruction of justice. The most important of the murder charges concerns the 1985 shooting of Mr Paul Castellano, the previous head of the Gambino crime family. Mr Salvatore Gravano, who has been identified by US officials as Mr Gotti's second-in-command, or consigliere, described in detail on Monday how he and Mr Gotti spent 10 months planning the assassination of Mr Castellano. Mr Gotti remained silent, with a tense smile, as his former lieutenant described how he had been inducted into the Mafia in 1976 in a blood ceremony and how by testifying he had broken the Mafia's traditional pledge of omerta, or code of silence. 'John was the boss. I was the underboss. I helped John run the family,' Mr Gravano explained, before describing a pattern of loan-sharking, armed robberies and his own participation in 19 murders. US prosecutors have agreed to reduce Mr Gravano's own prison sentence to 20 years in exchange for his turning state's witness. Not since the 1985-86 Palermo maxi-trial has a top-ranking Mafia insider in the US or Italy broken the code of silence and provided law enforcement officials with such a detailed portrait of how organised crime works. Prosecutors also hope to make use of less public leads to further their campaign against the Gambino and other US Mafia families, whose annual revenues total billions of dollars.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by I. Gridasov, chief of the Main Administration of </F> Crop Growing of the Ministry of Agriculture and Food of the  Russian Federation: "On the Course of Field Work"]    [Text] According to data of the State Committee on  Statistics of Russia, as of 25 April 1994 in the Northern  Caucasus region and the south of the Volga area the weather  conditions and the moisture content of the soil have been  favorable for the growth and development of winter crops. They  are mainly in the stage of stem extension here. In the Central  Chernozem region and the Central Volga area tillering of winter  crops is continuing and on the rest of the territory of Russia  they have resumed vegetation.    In Russia as a whole the condition of winter crops is  characterized by the following figures:    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                         |(millions of hectares)                             |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                         |1994                     |1993                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Planted (total)          |15.5                     |19.2                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Good and satisfactory    |12.6                     |17.6                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Dead and thin            |2.9                      |1.6                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      Winter crops suffered considerably more during the course of  wintering in Krasnodar Kray, where 34 percent of the planted  areas have died off or are thin, and Voronezh (40), Rostov (37),  Volgograd (30) and Belgorod (29 percent) Oblasts. At the present  time repair work is being done on the planted areas and they are  being top dressed with mineral fertilizers. In the southern  regions winter crops have been replanted and underplanted on an  area of 1.1 million hectares as compared to 113,000 as of this  date last year, and top dressing has been applied to only 2  million hectares, which is 1.6 million less than last year.    Field work is being done in 38 regions. Spring crops have  already been planted on 5.207 million hectares or 1.250 million  hectares more than last year.    This year agricultural commodity producers are experiencing  great difficulties with the acquisition of mineral fertilizers.  As of 1 April there were only 1.2 tonnes on the farms or half as  much as last year. The expected deliveries during April-June  will amount to 0.8-1.0 million tonnes. Thus Russia as a whole  will apply 8.4 million tonnes of them (4 times) less than the  average annual level during 1986-1990. This will lead to a crop  shortfall of about 30 million tonnes of agricultural products  translated into grain.    According to forecasts, in 1994 the phytosanitary situation  is expected to be difficult (increased damage from locusts, beet  webworm, pests and diseases of grain crops and potatoes, and  increased weediness of the fields).    At the same time the supply of pesticides (taking into  account the amounts left over on the farms and Selkhozkhimiya  bases and also the amounts earmarked for production by the  plants) for various crops will amount to 5-50 percent, and seed  disinfectants to 60 percent.    According to data from local agricultural organs, in Russia  as a whole a sufficient quantity of high-grade seeds of  oil-bearing crops has been stored except for sunflowers for feed  purposes--the shortage will be made up for with corn seeds. The  complete required supply of seeds of spring grain crops,  vegetables, melon crops, flax, and potatoes is on hand.</p>

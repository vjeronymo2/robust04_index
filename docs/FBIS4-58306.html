			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, May 3 (AFP) -- The signing of a final  agreement to launch Palestinian self-rule, due on Wednesday [4  May], could be delayed because Israel has triggered a  last-minute crisis, PLO delegates warned here Tuesday.    They charged Israel had reneged on several points of the  deal  for the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho.    "The climate of the negotiations is not satisfactory because  the Israeli side has gone back on several points," one of the  delegates, Jamil al-Tarifi, said.    Another delegate warned that the PLO would "not give in  under  pressure, even if that means that the accord will not be signed  tomorrow."    Israel is trying to squeeze last-minute concessions out of  the Palestinians because the signing has already been scheduled  for Wednesday, he explained, declining to be named.    "The Israelis have retracted on 24 points, including some of  the promises made last week by Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on  Peres such as the right of the Palestinians to issue stamps for  (letters sent) abroad," he said.    Delegates charged that Israel had also changed its stand on  Palestinian authority in al-Mawasi, next to the Jewish  settlements of Gush Katif in the southern Gaza Strip.    Amid the reports of a crisis, the PLO chief negotiator on  security issues, General 'Abd-al-Razzaq al-Yahya, went for  consultations with officials at the Egyptian Foreign Ministry.    Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and PLO leader Yasir  'Arafat were to hold talks here later Tuesday.    Their task was to resolve final differences over the size of  an autonomous Jericho, and the symbolic presence of a  Palestinian policeman on the Allenby Bridge linking Jordan to  the West Bank.    The signing ceremony set for Wednesday is to be attended by  dozens of foreign ministers and more than 2,000 guests.    It was being seen as a personal triumph for Egyptian  President Husni Mubarak, who has toiled to keep the autonomy  deal on track through months of tortuous negotiations, mostly in  Cairo.</p>

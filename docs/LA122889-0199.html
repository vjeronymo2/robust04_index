			<p><P> December 28, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ SMITH: U.N. COULD GET FIRST WOMAN SECRETARY GENERAL  </P> <P> THE UNITED NATIONS is a hotbed of progressive ferment these days, which is a  delightful change for that conservative body. Perhaps the fantastic changes  taking place in Europe are the cause. On Dec. 13, this column reported that  Kenya's ambassador to the United Nations, Michael George Okeyo, might well be  the one to take over the top spot of secretary general when Javier Perez de  Cuellar steps down. And, if this happens, Okeyo will become the first black  ever to head the world body.  </P> <P> Now another rumor is abounding, and Okeyo seems to have developed some  competition. Many delegates hope to push for the first female secretary general  should De Cuellar retire after his first term ends. There are a number of  female candidates, with Undersecretary Terese P. Sevigny, a French Canadian, in  the lead.  </P> <P> RAN INTO one of my all-time favorite creatures -- the comic actor Richard Lewis  -- who was bouncing around at NBC this week saying what a nervous wreck he was  over his Carnegie Hall one-man concert. Naturally, it was a sellout and a  standout.  </P> <P> Richard is the genial, good-natured co-star (with Jamie Lee Curtis) of the  television hit series "Anything But Love." He said that next Wednesday night,  he and Jamie Lee will offer their first segment in which the writer  protagonists get really romantic.  </P> <P> "We filmed our love scene in a bed in a hotel setting. We were like an Amish  couple. We were so intimidated. We were Goofy and Minnie making love. Jamie  Lee's husband was in the audience and so was my girlfriend. So we were  embarrassed by the whole thing. Believe me, you can't have loved ones watching  you act!"  </P> <P> Richard is a darling guy who really deserves his booming success. Happy New  Year, Richard, and continued poor posture in 1990.  </P> <P> I ASKED sports maven Michael Lupica to sum up the most important thing about  Billy Martin's death on the day after the controversial baseball man died in a  car accident. Mike gave a good answer about how Martin was a man beloved by New  Yorkers and other sports fans and how he'd always have a place in their hearts.  </P> <P> True. But in my opinion, not the most important thing. The death of Billy  Martin is one more cautionary tale about non-use of seat belts. I can just  envision Billy and his longtime friend William Reedy as they got in that truck  to drive to Billy's house in Upstate New York. Neither of these macho guys  wanted to be the first sissy to fasten his seat belt. So neither did. Billy  Martin needn't have died.  </P> <P> I know because several years ago I had almost the same kind of accident in the  same locale on an icy road. My car went through a guardrail, fell down a  60-foot ravine and turned over five times. I got out of the car and walked up  to the top of the ravine to the highway where a state trooper was rushing  toward me. He said: "Don't bother to tell me. You were wearing your seat belt,  right?" He was correct. He added, "It had to be because I've never unbuckled a  dead person."  </P> <P> Billy Martin is due whatever his place is in baseball and sport history. But  the most important event of his life is that he died when he didn't have to all  over a small, macho gesture of defiance against fate and the odds. But you  don't have to follow his bad example.  </P> <P> "SATURDAY NIGHT with Connie Chung" postponed its year-end roundup of  observations until this weekend. I can't wait to hear what Malcolm Forbes has  to say!  </P></p>

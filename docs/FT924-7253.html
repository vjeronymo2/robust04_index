			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Survey of Energy Efficiency (2): Fences become higher - EC programmes are under pressure MEASURES to improve European energy efficiency are under threat from economic slowdown, rising transport volumes, integration of the former East Germany and arguments about the acceptable form of an energy tax. Those are the underlying messages of recent environmental reports from the European Commission and of its investigation into new directives to encourage energy efficiency. The EC's use of energy has risen steadily in the past decade, mainly because of the growth of road and air transport. The most recent comprehensive figures show that in 1989 the EC - which did not then include the East German Lander - consumed 752.8m tonnes of oil or oil equivalent (mtoe), an 8 per cent rise on the 1981 level. During that period the use of energy by transport, which accounts for nearly a third of EC energy consumption, grew by 31 per cent, more than offsetting the 9 per cent fall in industrial use of energy. The EC has a long-standing target of improving the efficiency of final consumption of energy by 20 per cent between 1985 and 1995. At the Rio Earth Summit in June it added a second energy-related objective: the stabilisation of emissions of the 'greenhouse' gas carbon dioxide, mainly produced by burning fossil fuels, at 1990 levels by the year 2000. The EC's record is by no means the world's worst - in 1989 the 12 EC countries emitted 760.9m tonnes of carbon, or 12.9 per cent of the world total. That translates to 2.34 tonnes per capita, less than half the US's level of around 5 tonnes per capita and compared with 0.2 tonnes per capita for developing countries. However, it has been clear that the EC targets would be unachievable without new measures. The Community's policy has had three main planks: its SAVE programme to encourage energy efficiency; a proposed tax on energy and its carbon content to encourage energy conservation; and separate national measures. SAVE - the Specific Action for Vigorous Energy Efficiency (SAVE) programme - was proposed two years ago following anxiety that the Community was making little progress towards its targets. The latest draft directive, published in June, lists seven measures for countries to take: certification of carbon dioxide emissions from buildings caused by energy use; billing heating, air-conditioning and hot-water costs on the basis of consumption, not flat rate tariffs; promoting third-party financing of energy efficiency investments in the public sector; thermal insulation of new buildings; regular inspection of boilers; regular inspection of cars; energy audits of businesses. Expectations of SAVE were initially high. In the November 1990 proposal for the programme, the European Commission projected that SAVE would reduce the final demand for energy in the EC in 2010 by 100 mtoe per year, a reduction of 12 per cent compared with levels if the programme was not introduced. It would also cut primary demand for energy in 2010 by 160 mtoe per year, and cut carbon dioxide emissions by more than 500m tonnes per year - more than 15 per cent lower than projected levels. However by June 1992, estimates of its impact were nearly nine times lower - a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions of only 61mt. Mr Andrew Warren, director of the European Association for Conservation of Energy, says 'SAVE now is a sad thing compared to what was originally envisaged. Nowhere does the draft directive specify what countries must do, beyond 'taking appropriate measures'. Originally there were quite specific standards.' One reason for the scaling down of projections appears to be cost: countries and their national utilities have been reluctant to foot the bill for the necessary investment and marketing, particularly in mid-recession. A second reason appears to be that political attention switched to the more ambitious and more controversial proposals for a carbon or energy tax. EC countries have made clear that they cannot hope to stabilise carbon emissions without a tax, and the Commission has proposed an initial level of Dollars 3 a barrel of oil or oil equivalent, rising to Dollars 10. The German government has given particularly strong backing for the proposals, partly because the integration of the former East Germany has sent its carbon emissions soaring. Of the 1bn tonnes of carbon dioxide emitted by Germany each year, around a third comes from the eastern states although they have only a fifth of the combined population. They are still heavily dependent on lignite, a particularly 'dirty' form of energy. Although lignite, or brown coal, is gradually being phased out, the number of cars in the east is rising fast - the government projects it will soon double. However, German industrialists have bitterly attacked their government's support for the tax, saying that it could cost German industry DM 12bn-15bn by 2000, and that the consumer will ultimately bear the costs. The Commission's studies acknowledge the side-effects of the medicine - they estimate that the proposed tax could cut 0.25 per cent off EC real GDP growth in the second and third years after introduction, and 0.07 per cent over the first 13 years. The political difficulties in introducing the tax are therefore great, particularly with several countries on the brink of sharp recessions. Proposals for the tax are now stalled while the EC countries reflect on the costs and consider whether they could afford to introduce it unilaterally, even if the rest of the OECD countries did not. Economic slowdown - which is just beginning to affect several of the continental European countries - is making the EC's energy efficiency and conservation measures more difficult to implement. At present, in spite of several years of intense discussion, much less progress has been made than was envisaged and the targets still look elusive. The one compensation is that recession is also reducing the demand for energy and reducing the emission of unwanted gases - but that is not a long term solution.</p>

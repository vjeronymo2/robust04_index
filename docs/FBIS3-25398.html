			<p>Language: <F P=105> Afrikaans </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The government has confirmed that a special session  of Parliament will be convened within two weeks two bring about  far reaching amendments to the interim and the electoral  constitutions. The announcement flows from proposals made by the  government and the ANC [African National Congress] which could  pave the way for an all inclusive settlement.    [Begin Constitutional Development Minister Roelf Meyer  recording] Even if we fail to get the constitution as far as  convincing the Freedom Alliance parties to also accept the  proposals, we nevertheless still have to go ahead and push it  through Parliament, to amend the constitution and also to adapt  the electoral constitution so as to create the possibility for  further registration by other parties. [end recording]    The proposals make for, among others, provision for a double  ballot, the entrenchment of the volkstaat [Afrikaner homeland]  idea in the final constitution, extended powers to provinces,  the retention of the name kwaZulu/Natal, and the postponement of  the registration date for political parties to take part in the  election.    The Freedom Alliance says it is cautiously optimistic about  the proposals. However, all the parties want to study the  proposals before reacting to them.    KwaZulu Chief Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi has called it a  step in the right direction. He also disclosed that President  F.W. de Klerk told him by telephone that a government delegation  was to meet King Goodwill Zwelithini soon to eliminate  obscurities about his constitutional role. Reaction has also  been received from the Inkatha Freedom Party, the PAC  [Pan-Africanist Congress] and the Democratic Party [DP].    [Begin recording] [Inkatha's Hennie Bekker] The first  reaction to that is that there is a possibility of us moving  forward and we can look if we cannot find each other along the  way.    [PAC's Gora Ebrahim, in English] We of the PAC are certainly  opposed to the balkanization or the creation of ethnic states.  But we do recognize the fact that there is a need for an all  inclusive election in our country, and we hope that this would  now pave the way for inclusive elections to take place not later  than the 27th of April 1994.    [DP's Douglas Gibson] Regarding the possibility of a  volkstaat feel a little uncomfortable because three days ago Mr.  Nelson Mandela announced there would not be a volkstaat in South  Africa. His statement now seems to hint that there could be a  volkstaat, and on television last night, Dr. Pallo Jordan said  that the ANC has not changed its approach at all, so I'm not  sure whether they are not just playing with words.

			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / Technology (Worth Watching): Turning the wheels on the car thief To combat the growing trend of car theft, a new French device renders a vehicle unable to be driven by disengaging the steering wheel from the steering column, writes Anna Kochan. Anyone breaking into the car and starting the engine finds the steering wheel turning without steering the wheels. The device, produced by Malvy Technology, can be fitted during assembly or later at a cost of Ffr4,800 (Pounds 560). It consists of a sealed box containing a series of mechanical locks which fit between the steering column and the wheel. The key provides more than 100m combinations. Malvy's system will become available in January. Insurance companies have indicated they will lower premiums on cars equipped with the product. Malvy Technology: France, 331 60192000.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Presidency member Ejup Ganic by Renato </F> Cemerika; place and date not given: "The Agreement Is Our  Success"]    [Text] Until recently, Ejup Ganic did not hide the  fact that he wanted the war to continue and that his dream was  to conquer Vitez in order to round up the production program for  equipping the Muslim army. With the intention of finding out  whether he had changed his views, especially those on Croat  relations, we asked him to comment on the preliminary agreement  signed in Washington and to assess the possibility of  implementing the agreement.    [Ganic] The agreement is a political success for the  Presidency and the Bosnia-Herzegovina Government, because we  have been fighting against the division of Bosnia-Herzegovina  from the very beginning. We started out together with the  Croats against the Serbian aggressor, who not only wanted to  divide Bosnia-Herzegovina but also conquer all of  Bosnia-Herzegovina and a large part of Croatia, but the creation  of Herceg-Bosna -- Greater Croatia -- resulted in a conflict  between the Croats and the Muslims. This agreement is necessary  to preserve the integrity of Bosnia-Herzegovina, which the  Bosnian Croats proposed at their assembly in Sarajevo last month  and the Muslim -- Bosniak leadership -- in Bosnia-Herzegovina.  The success of the agreement depends on the Croatian side,  especially the extreme part of the leadership from Grude.    [Cemerika] What about the extreme part of the Muslim  leadership?    [Ganic] I think all Muslims are doing their best to preserve  the integrity of Bosnia-Herzegovina, regardless of their  politics.    [Cemerika] Some Muslim generals do not believe in the  political solution and they do not trust politicians.    [Ganic] The Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency -- that is, its  president -- is the supreme commander of the army, and since we  now have an organized army that gets its orders from its supreme  commander, I do not believe that there are officers in our army  who do not obey those orders.    [Cemerika] If this agreement with the Croats is successful,  how will you arrange your relations with the Serbs?    [Ganic] Bosnia-Herzegovina is a country that belongs to all  of its citizens, and every honest Serb has his or her place in  that country. We will try to come to an agreement with those  Serbs who still believe in the integrity of Bosnia-Herzegovina  because the agreement with the Croats is not aimed against the  Serbs.    [Cemerika] Has Izetbegovic authorized Silajdzic to make this  agreement?    [Ganic] Mr. Silajdzic cannot sign any agreement without  authorization from the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency -- that is,  its president, Alija Izetbegovic.    [Cemerika] If the Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly rejects the  agreement, will Mr. Izetbegovic also reject it?    [Ganic] We are a democratic country with a democratic system  and the Assembly elected by the people, and if the Assembly  rejects the agreement, then no one has the right to accept it,  although I am sure it will be unanimously adopted by the  Assembly.    [Cemerika] During our conversation, you have shown that you  are in favor of a peaceful solution for Bosnia-Herzegovina.  However, you are famous for your "hard" views in your statements  on solving the Bosnia-Herzegovina problem and you have advocated  war more often than peace. Can you explain this change?    [Ganic] First of all, I did not make such statements and,  second, every new event deserves a new comment.    [Cemerika] If a confederation between Croatia and  Bosnia-Herzegovina is formed, will you lose your position?    [Ganic] (laughter) There will be democratic elections!</p>

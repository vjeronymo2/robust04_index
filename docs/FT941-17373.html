			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / World Trade News: US turns to Europe for steel needs American steel companies, buoyed by the economic recovery, have been importing large amounts of European steel to meet rising demand from the motor industry and other prospering sectors. With the bulk of the US industry's anti-dumping and countervailing duty cases now on appeal, US companies have been focusing on production. According to Mr Horst Buelte, president of the American Institute for International Steel, producers are now among the largest importers, bringing in semi-finished steel, because demand is 'so huge that the capacity is not sufficient'. 'US mills are working 89-90 per cent capacity utilisation,' he said. 'Production bottlenecks and full order books in 1993 have forced US mills to turn to foreign suppliers for large quantities of semi-finished steel like slabs and billets.' The American Iron and Steel Institute, which represents steel companies, says imports from the EU rose almost 37 per cent between October 1992 and October last year. At the same time, imports from Japan fell by almost 33 per cent. The greatest beneficiary of the surge was Italy, which has been resisting EU plans to reduce excess production. Italy's exports to the US rose almost 290 per cent to 156,205 short tons between October 1992 and 1993. Over the same period Danish imports rose 90 per cent; Greek imports 85 per cent; Belgian, 58 per cent and British, 4.7 per cent. Imports from Germany totalled 303,893 tons, a 21 per cent increase. However, while US imports have been rising to accommodate the recovery, exports have been falling as overseas markets dry up. From October 1992 to October last year foreign sales dropped 15 per cent to 290,000 tons.</p>

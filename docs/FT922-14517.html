			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / Election 1992: Tory defeat may mean 'make or break' for TUC THE Trades Union Congress could become increasingly irrelevant if Labour wins the election, with the biggest unions dealing directly with the government. Some senior TUC and union officials warn of a Labour victory being 'make or break' for the TUC in its present form. They also expect renewed pressure on Mr Norman Willis, TUC general secretary, to retire early to make way for Mr John Monks, his deputy. Mr Willis, having weathered eight years under the Tories, will not go willingly. He has also just completed the first year of a four-year term as European TUC president. The TUC has the opportunity to restore some of its lost credibility in helping a Labour government steer through a potentially ambitious programme of industrial relations changes. But as one TUC official said: 'The TUC has adapted much less well than many of the bigger unions to the culture changes of the past decade'. Industrial relations reforms will not be the top priority for a Labour government and unions' expectations are not high. But Labour party and union officials agree on what an ideal three-stage timetable might be. The first stage would consist of symbolic gestures with few immediate practical consequences. These would include signing the Maastricht 'social chapter' and letting unions back into GCHQ, the government's secret communications centre. Immediate changes, not requiring primary legislation, could also be made to beef up employment protection. The two main pieces of primary legislation would be a recognition act and an act of positive rights for employees which would be named after Mr Tony Blair, Labour's employment spokesman. The recognition act would allow unions incremental representational rights, depending on how many employees voted for such rights, culminating in full collective bargaining rights if more than 50 per cent voted in favour.</p>

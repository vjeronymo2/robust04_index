Subsequently, the Commission Staff notified Texas Eastern that there was a technical error on the tariff sheets as filed. The error did not affect the proposed language or the pagination, but was simply a spacing error. In light of such error, Texas Eastern withdrew its September 1, 1994 filing. This filing replaces the withdrawn filing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Texas Eastern states that these tariff sheets (1) modify Section 2.4 and delete Section 16.3 of the General Terms and Conditions, which relate to information on the availability of capacity, (2) revise Section 3.2 of the General Terms and Conditions, which refers to the information required for a valid request for transportation service, and (3) update Section 16 of the General Terms and Conditions. The proposed effective date of the tariff sheets is October 1, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Texas Eastern states that copies of the filing were served on firm customers of Texas Eastern and interested state commissions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Sections 385.214 and 385.211 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations.

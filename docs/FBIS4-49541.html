			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Dispatch from New York: "Shanghai Pro-Democracy Activist </F> Lin Muchen [2651 3668 2525] Detained While Checking In at  Airport"]    [Text] Lin Muchen, one of the drafters of the "19 Articles  on 1994 Charter of Political Democratization," which was  initiated by 54 people, including Bao Ge [7637 2047], Yang Zhou  [2799 0719], and so on, had originally planned to leave Shanghai  by Korean Air last Friday morning [6 May] for the United States  to further his education at his own expense. Unexpectedly, when  he checked in at the airport, he was detained by the  authorities. By late Friday night there had been no news about  him, and his family also knows nothing of his whereabouts  despite inquiries through many channels.    As disclosed by a friend of Lin Muchen in New York, Lin was  approved and issued with a student visa by the U.S. Consulate  General in Shanghai to further his studies at his own expense.    Lin's friend pointed out that the Chinese authorities had  approved allowing him to leave the country, but suddenly went  back on their word and detained him. Obviously, this action is  unwise as it happens on the eve of when U.S. President Clinton  is about to announce whether he will extend most-favored-nation  treatment to China on 3 June.    Lin Muchen is an "old line" pro-democracy activist. He was  one of the organizers of the "Shanghai Spring" during the period  of the "Xidan Democracy Wall" movement in Beijing as early as  the late 1970's. Later, he was thrown into prison for his  active participation in the pro-democracy movement in 1989.    Meanwhile, last Saturday [7 May] marked two years' of  detention without trial for another Chinese dissident, Kang  Yuchun [1660 3768 2504], who is being kept in the heavily  guarded Beijing Banbuqiao Detention Center, and whose relatives  and friends have heard nothing about him so far.</p>

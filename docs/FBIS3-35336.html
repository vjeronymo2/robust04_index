			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by party affairs correspondent Yerah Tal] </F>   [Excerpts] Approximately 30,000 people have registered  themselves in the framework of the special National Religious  Party [NRP] registration campaign, which started on 15 November  1993 and has just ended. NRP officials were surprised by the  larger than expected turnout. According to NRP estimates, the  number of registrants was expected to be far lower due to the  campaign's low public profile.    NRP officials expressed the assessment that the relatively  high turnout, which includes many new names, may lead to serious  changes in the composition of the delegates to the NRP  convention and in the party's list of candidates to the Knesset.  The census was carried out prior to the internal elections for  the party's convention and for the councils of the various  branches, which will be held on 26 April 1994. [passage omitted]    The last NRP census was conducted seven years ago. That was  also the last time the party held internal elections.    Since then, the NRP has twice postponed the census with the  approval of the movement's tribunal. Once, because the date of  national elections was brought forward, and a second time due to  the local council elections. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tallinn, June 01, BNS -- Former Defense Minister  Indrek Kannik today accused Prime Minister Mart Laar of giving  the public, as he said, slightly distorted information about a  defense cooperation plan between Estonia and Israel.    Kannik mentioned that Laar had been incorrect when denying  having signed any documents about defense cooperation with  Israel. The former minister quoted Laar's May 17 letter to the  commander in chief of the country's defense forces, Major  General Aleksander Einseln, in which the premier said the  government had signed no agreement with Israeli General Dan  Shomron.    But a protocol of a Feb. 8 meeting between Laar and Shomron  states that "the guests and Mr. Laar agreed that cooperation  between Estonia and Israel can be divided into three main  categories," Kannik said today, adding that one of these three  had been setting up a joint work group to review Estonia's  defense concept both from the military as well as from security  aspects. The work group was to be formed under the Estonian  Interior Ministry.    Laar before the Feb. 8 meeting suggested the work group to  be  subjected to the Defense Ministry, but that proposal was turned  down, Kannik said in the interview with BNS.    Estonia's POSTIMEES daily newspaper in its May 30 edition  reported that Commander in Chief Aleksander Einseln was seeking  clarity over allegations that the prime minister had bypassed  him in steps toward a defense cooperation plan with Israel.  Einseln said his suspicions were raised after an aide to Leonid  Apananski, considered a key figure behind the country's major  arms purchase deal from Israel, in a confidential letter  informed a Central Staff officer about a May 10-12 visit to  Tallinn of an Israeli delegation. The visit had been to discuss  a cooperation project, started by Mart Laar and Israeli General  Dan Shamron, the letter alleged.</p>

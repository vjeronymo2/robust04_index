			<p>Language: <F P=105> Swedish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Guest commentary by former Finance Minister Allan Larsson, </F> chairman of European Social Democratic working group on  unemployment: "Strengthen European Cooperation; Opportunity To  Combat Unemployment in Europe Is Greater Than Believed"]    [Text] The growing unemployment in Europe is due primarily  to a structural problem of the labor market, very low demand,  and a lack of cooperation in taking advantage of the potential  inherent in an integrated European economy. Political measures  are called for that can stimulate economic activity and promote  investment in the economy, which is in reality independent of  the rest of the world. This is the opinion of Allan Larsson, who  headed a joint working group for the European Social Democratic  Party on combating unemployment. He presents the group's  conclusions.    Is it possible to garner broad support for a new economic  policy that unites West Europe in the struggle against mass  unemployment? Or are we so divided that there can be no hope for  gathering the necessary forces?    There are at least some positive signs. In early 1993,  Jacques Delors and the Danish Government under Paul Nyrup  Rasmussen, which at that time held the chairmanship of the EC,  placed the battle against unemployment high on the European  agenda. The summit meeting in Copenhagen in June was a small but  important step forward. Work on Delors' white paper has focused  political attention this fall on Europe's greatest  misfortune--the fact that more than 20 million people are out of  work, half of them for more than a year.    But the public debate gives the impression that there is a  deep split. On one hand, there are those who cherish the  laissez-faire mentality that led Europe into this crisis of mass  unemployment. They simply offer more of the same, a fine tuning  of the neoliberal policy with deregulation, reduced government  responsibility, and increased insecurity. On the other hand,  there is a growing number of people--ordinary citizens who are  deeply concerned, perceptive economists, conscientious  politicians--who regard the present situation as so serious that  they want to see a thorough analysis and rethinking of the  policy that led to this record level unemployment. They want a  total new direction, not just fine tuning of the present policy.    In order to promote the need for new ideas, new directions,  and innovative measures, Willy Claes in Belgium, Felipe Gonzalez  in Spain, Franz Vranitzky in Austria, Wim Kok in the  Netherlands, Ingvar Carlsson and all of the other party leaders  of the European Social Democratic Party (PES) initiated a  comprehensive program--The European Employment Initiative. Under  my leadership during the fall, the study group worked with  leading economists in Europe, with Delors and his colleagues on  the EC Commission, and with experts in diverse national organs.  In connection with this work, I visited 15 countries in West  Europe in order to gain some insight into various national  situations and to obtain advice on designing a new policy on  full employment.    We have now handed over the report, entitled "Put Europe  Back  to Work," to the chairman of the PES [Social Welfare Committee],  Belgian Foreign Affairs Minister Willy Claes, who is also  chairman of the EC Council of Ministers, and to all of the other  party leaders. The report will provide the basis for their  discussions and resolution at a meeting in Brussels tomorrow  (Thursday), the day before the European summit meeting.    We concentrated upon Europe's two major economic threats:  mass unemployment and the growing deficit in public finances.  These two problems are closely related and must be approached  through a common economic policy.    We posed five questions in the quest for answers concerning  the high and growing unemployment: Is unemployment due to trade  and overwhelming international competition? To new technology  that replaces jobs? To an imbalance between savings and  investment, that is to say, a lack of demand? Or is it  sluggishness in the labor market that prevents Europe from  increasing its rate of growth sufficiently to push down  unemployment? Or is it due to an antagonism between the  integrated European economy that we have created and the fact  that every country continues to conduct its own national policy?    We have come to the conclusion that answers can be found in  all five areas, but mostly in the last three mentioned:  structural problems in the labor market, faltering demand, and  the lack of a coordinated policy to take advantage of the  integrated European economic potential.    I will present a few facts that will open new perspectives  on  what can and should be done.    The European countries, the EC and EFTA [European Free Trade  Association] nations, are economically so closely interwoven  that we now have in practice a single integrated European  economy. This integrated economy is surprisingly independent of  the rest of the world. No less than 93 percent of all investment  and all consumption stems from production in West Europe. Only 7  percent is derived from imports from other parts of the world.  This tells us that there is much more scope than is generally  imagined for a concerted action that promotes growth and creates  new jobs. This tells us also that there is a greater need for  free trade than is generally believed.    Our integrated European economy is currently suffering from  weak demand on the one hand and structural problems in the labor  market on the other. There is a gap between investment and  financial savings in the private sector on the order of 6  percent of GNP, a lag in demand representing 8 to 9 million jobs.    The surplus of financial savings, which in reality is an  expression for a deficit in real savings, or investment, has a  flip side, namely a deficit in public finances that currently  amounts to 6 to 7 percent of GNP.    The weakness in economic activity in the private sector is  the source of the deficit in the public sector. When jobs  disappear and unemployment rises, public finances are undermined  from two directions: Expenditures grow and revenues weaken. The  underlying structural deficit mirrors a second structural  problem: long-term unemployment and cuts in social services.    We concluded from this and other factors that a program of  action is needed that in magnitude and duration diverges  radically from all that has been tried and discussed before.  Such a new economic policy for full employment must have two  pillars: investment in business and investment in education and  skills.    Above all, Europe needs more businessmen, more businesses,  and greater investment in the private sector. Political measures  designed to stimulate economic activity play a decisive role in  creating confidence in the future and interest in investment. We  wish to generate as many confidence-creating measures as  possible through monetary policy. We suggest that ECOFIN [EC  Council of Economic and Finance Ministers], that is, the EC's  economic and finance ministers, as well as EMI [European  Monetary Institute], the new monetary institute, mount a  concerted action to bring down interest rates in Europe. Low  interest rates make productive investments more profitable and  promote a balance between savings and investment, a key  objective of monetary policy.    A new economic policy--based upon investment in business,  research and development, infrastructure, housing, and urban  renewal--is necessary but not sufficient. It is just as  necessary to deal with the structural problems in the labor  market, the lack of correspondence between the demand for  training and job skills on the one hand and the range and  quality of education on the other. Europe has a labor market  that is out of phase due to the fact that demand for labor  changes quickly as a result of new technology and international  competition, while change is slow in the educational system,  which is not organized for the new job market.    Thus we propose joint initiatives aimed at forcefully  increasing investment in training and job skills. We would like  to increase quality and capacity by an additional 5 million  places in education, job training, retraining, and skill level  development. An investment such as this will impact  approximately 2.5 percent of the work force and will have very  positive, long-term effects on growth and immediate effects on  the battle against unemployment.    A new economic policy for full employment--with the object  of  first and foremost creating jobs in the private sector--is the  most important measure for revitalizing healthy public finances.  Cutting unemployment in half will go far in helping to balance  Europe's national budgets.    Our program "Put Europe Back to Work" is based upon the  simple but fundamental insight that work is a greater  contribution to economic and social progress than unemployment  is. It is also based upon the insight that Europe has an  enormous potential for growth through the mobilization of  people's desire and ability to work and create new resources. It  is high time for joint action, for a collective policy that  builds not on the limitations of national economies, but on the  great possibilities that an integrated European economy offers.</p>

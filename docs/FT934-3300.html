			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Hodgson plans Hoskins growth Mr Howard Hodgson, the ebullient former funeral director who returned to the stock market in the summer after a period of self-imposed exile, yesterday announced the first moves in the intended expansion of his adopted vehicle, writes Graham Deller. Hoskins Brewery, the tiny Leicester-based real-ale brewer of which Mr Hodgson is now chief executive, confirmed yesterday that discussions were in progress over the possible acquisition of Ronson, the Leeds-based lighters company. At the same time, shares of LGW, the USM marketing and luxury goods group, jumped 17p to 159p on the disclosure it was in talks with Hoskins. Hoskins shares were suspended at 78p.</p>

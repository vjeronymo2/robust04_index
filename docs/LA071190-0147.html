			<p><P> July 11, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> IT'S OFFICIAL: DEMOCRATS PICK N.Y.  </P> <P> Democratic Chairman Ronald H. Brown made it official today -- the party's 1992  national convention will be held in New York City.  </P> <P> "Democrats will nominate the next President of the United States two years from  . . . this week in America's most dynamic city and in one of the world's  greatest cities -- New York, the Big Apple," Brown said in announcing the  decision.  </P> <P> Brown also said he is considering several format changes for the convention,  including possibly cutting the event from four days to three and holding it on  the weekend instead of midweek.  </P> <P> New York officials believe the convention will pump $100 million into the  city's economy, and landing the event is a plum for Mayor David N. Dinkins, who  lobbied aggressively for more than a year to persuade Brown to bring the party  to New York, which hosted Democratic conventions in 1976 and 1980.  </P></p>

			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / Banks face liability for pollution THE GOVERNMENT has rejected calls by banks to be shielded from the potential multimillion pound costs of cleaning industrial sites polluted by their corporate customers. Mr Tim Yeo, the environment minister, is to tell leading banks today that the government believes they must bear some financial responsibility in cases where they have lent money to companies which pollute the environment. Mr Yeo will tell the British Bankers' Association that the government does not accept that responsibility should fall solely on the polluting company, or on public authorities in cases where the company cannot meet clean-up costs. He will say that banks are responsible along with polluters and landowners. 'They must live up to those responsibilities and not simply turn it all over to the government to sort it out,' the text of Mr Yeo's speech says. The speech follows lobbying by banks to be protected from liability for clean-up costs in cases where they take possession of polluted land or where they lend money to companies and so might be held to have an influence over managements. Banks have argued that they may limit lending to companies in some industries if they face unlimited liability for environmental pollution. They are worried some US legal standards may be adopted in Europe. The European Commission has issued a green paper on remedying environmental damage which considers a single legal framework for liability. The UK government is also reviewing policy on contaminated land. Banks have been particularly worried by the Fleet Factors case in the US three years ago, in which a court held that banks must pay for pollution damage if they had the capacity to influence the policy of a company. Mr Yeo will say that the government does not favour the US framework, but liability 'should follow responsibility - possibly even to bankers under some circumstances'. Public funds should be used to clean up sites only where there is no alternative. Mr Derek Wanless, chief executive of National Westminster Bank and chairman of the government's advisory committee on business and the environment, has been among bankers calling for banks to be shielded.</p>

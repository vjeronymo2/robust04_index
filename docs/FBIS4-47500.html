Krishchenko, Moscow State Technical </F> University imeni N.E. Bauman; UDC 62-50]    [Abstract] An analysis was conducted of the problem of  synthesis of a terminal control algorithm for multi-dimensional  nonlinear systems in the presence of state and control  constraints. The algorithm proposed to solve the problem is  based on a differential geometry approach to nonlinear systems  and the concept of inverse problems of dynamics. The algorithm  includes elements of several heuristic techniques as key  components, and the proposed solution method entails the use of  mathematical modeling in the control algorithm development  stage. The workings of the proposed algorithm are illustrated by  way of the example of solution of the problem of trajectory  control of the three-dimensional motion of an aerospace vehicle  in the three-dimensional prelanding maneuver leg of its flight.  The underlying idea of the method is as follows: New (auxiliary)  equations are introduced to transform the equations describing  the control object's motion to affine form, i.e., to make them  linear relative to the new equations. The new equations are  designed to make it possible to transform the resultant  equations to regular canonic form. After the equations are  transformed into canonic form based on the concept of inverse  dynamics equations, a program solution to a terminal problem is  constructed and then stabilized by using a method proposed and  published by the author in 1985. The values obtained for the  auxiliary equations are then recalculated into the values of the  starting equations. The aforementioned steps constitute the  basic algorithm. If it does not yield a solution to the  formulated problem with consideration for all of its constraints  and for the entire set of initial states, the algorithm is used  in conjunction with mathematical modeling to select the required  number of intermediate states, and the sequence of their  implementation to achieve more complex trajectories is  established. The end result is an algorithm that establishes, on  the basis of the initial state, the respective intermediate (or  assigned terminal) state into which the control object has been  brought. If the state is an intermediate state, the subsequent  state into which the object must be brought so as to ultimately  reach the terminal state is already known. For the example  presented, it is sufficient to find about 10 intermediate  states. The new algorithm is said to be suitable for a broad  class of objects. Although mathematical modeling must be  resorted to when the algorithm is developed, it may eventually  be written in ``analytical form,'' i.e., calculated on the basis  of the formulas derived, and thus does not require computers  with speeds or amounts of memory greater than those currently  available.

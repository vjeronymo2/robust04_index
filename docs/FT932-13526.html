			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / UK Company News: QMH sells Harmony stake QUEENS MOAT Houses, the hotel group, yesterday sold a 14.5 per cent stake in Harmony Leisure, the pubs and restaurants company, to Southend Property Holdings. Southend, an existing minority shareholder in Harmony, said it made a bid for the stake after shares in the hotel group were suspended last month. Describing the transaction as a 'good opportunity', Mr Malcolm Dagul, chairman of Southend, said the group had agreed to buy 3.88m Harmony shares at 5p apiece. The sale is dependent on a planned rights issue at Harmony being underwritten.</p>

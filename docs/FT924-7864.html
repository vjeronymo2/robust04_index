			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / Survey of Japan and the European Community (5): Time for rigorous assessment - Investment in manufacturing IN CONTRAST to the 1980s, a decade that witnessed a frantic rush by Japanese companies to invest in the European Community, the 1990s are characterised by a more cautious approach by the Japanese to investment in the region. The change reflects both the end of the first big wave of Japanese investment in the EC and the different economic climate in which Japanese corporations are finding themselves as business activity in leading world markets, including their home market, has remained depressed. The number of new Japanese manufacturing investments in Europe has fallen from that in the previous year, according to a survey of Japanese manufacturers conducted by the Japan External Trade Organisation (Jetro) earlier this year. After increasing by more than 100 each year since 1988, the Jetro survey found that the number of manufacturing companies with Japanese capitalisation of at least 10 per cent in 19 EC and EFTA nations rose by just 69 last year. While the increase still represents an 11 per cent rise from 652 to 721, the pace has clearly slowed. The fall in new investments comes despite the growing importance of the EC as a market in the eyes of Japanese executives. It is not that Japanese companies are turning their backs on Europe but rather that most Japanese companies with an interest in setting up business in the EC have done so already. At the same time, the recession combined with the serious cracks that have emerged within the EC months before the single market is set to start and the political turmoil in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, have all contributed to a feeling that growth for growth's sake may not be the most sensible strategy. Recessionary pressures, for example, have thwarted the plans of some medium- and smaller-sized companies which had planned to invest in Europe after setting up in the US, according to Mr Masao Kobayashi at Jetro. The latest trend in Japanese activity in the EC is therefore not so much for investment by newcomers but for a more rigorous assessment by companies already located in the EC of their long-term plans for Europe. This reassessment has brought about an interesting pattern of activity among Japanese companies in the region. On the one hand, there has been a strong rise in recapitalisation by Japanese corporations in areas where they expect to see market growth. At the same time, however, many Japanese companies are busy restructuring their European businesses to create greater efficiencies and a better co-ordinated regional operation. Here, the trigger seems to be the economic downturn rather than any immediate developments arising from the impending single European market. Among the companies Jetro surveyed, more than 73 per cent have undergone or are undergoing recapitalisation. The reasons for doing so vary from the need to expand production or modernise facilities to diversification into new fields. NEC, the world's largest semiconductor manufacturer, for example, recently announced it would invest Pounds 9m on a sophisticated order processing system in its semiconductor manufacturing plant in Livingston, Scotland, where the company has been located for 10 years. The trend indicates that in some areas, expectations among Japanese executives for the European single market have remained high despite the current economic weakness of the region. Meanwhile, the world recession that is slashing the profits of corporate Japan has led to a greater awareness of the need to rationalise operations in the region. Toshiba's Europe Office in London, for example, is currently busy considering ways in which the operations of 37 Toshiba companies in 11 European countries can be rationalised. These Toshiba companies in the EC were set up over the years according to the different needs of each division. As a result, there are many areas of business that overlap and could be combined for greater efficiency. 'Until now, as long as sales increased it was still alright that there were so many separate Toshiba companies each with their own staff for various functions, such as advertising,' says Mr Yuji Wakayama, general manager of corporate communications at the Europe Office in London. The recession, however, has changed all that and the group is considering restructuring some manufacturing facilities as well, although no specific plans have been announced yet. One step in that direction that has already been taken was to combine some of the functions of the PC sales companies in Belgium and Holland as neither country is large enough as a market to justify the presence of independent sales companies. Another aim of the Europe Office is to co-ordinate European activities, advise on future strategies and become the corporate 'face' of Toshiba in Europe. Before the new office was established, the group as a whole was not represented as each business division had its own European headquarters in various cities. Toshiba is not alone is trying to restructure its European operations. Other Japanese corporations are studying the possibility of relocating their European headquarters for various strategic reasons, according to Mr Haruo Ohtsuki, executive consultant in the international markets group at KPMG Peat Marwick, the management consultancy. For example, more companies are expressing an interest in taking advantage of different corporation tax levels that exist in different countries within the EC, Mr Ohtsuki notes. Nevertheless, the most widespread response among Japanese companies to the approach of the single European market has been to quicken the pace of localisation of their operations. Asked what steps they were taking to prepare for the single market, over half of the respondents to the Jetro survey cited localisation of business activities by increasing employment of local staff and activities to benefit their local communities. There is also great interest in the goings-on in Brussels and some Japanese companies have taken moves to help them to better deal with the Commission. A keen concern among Japanese companies is how the Community's relationship with its eastern neighbours develops amid the political unrest in eastern Europe and volatile situation in Russia. They are looking forward with great expectations - and fingers crossed - to the birth of a huge market spanning not just the European Community but all the way to the Russian steppes. In the meantime, there could be more restructurings if the business climate remains weak. But Jetro believes that once economic activity picks up, there is plenty of room for new investments in the EC, particularly by medium to small-sized companies. At the end of March 1991, Japanese investment in Europe amounted to only 22.5 per cent of total Japanese investment overseas, compared with 43.3 per cent invested in the US, according to the ministry of finance. The figures indicate that Japanese investment in Europe has not seen its full potential yet, Jetro concludes.</p>

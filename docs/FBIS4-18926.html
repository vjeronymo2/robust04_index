			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Udo Kreikemeier commentary: "Victory for Free Trade"] </F>   [Text] The dispute about the social clauses will not  prevent the signing of the treaty on the founding of a World  Trade Organization (WTO). The 120 member states of GATT will  finally be able to end the talks on the Uruguay Round that  lasted for several years.    The United States has not succeeded in ensuring the  inclusion  of standards for the rights of employees. No matter how  important topics like minimum wages and child labor are in  developing countries -- they must not prevent the signing of an  agreement at the last minute that at least curbs protectionism.    The Social Democratic Party of Germany should have thought  about that before demanding that Bonn not sign a WTO treaty  without clauses on the rights of employees. French farmers,  European film lobbyists, and others have long enough been trying  to prevent the signing. According to GATT calculations, the  agreement will result in an increase in world trade by $750  billion within 10 years, which is a 12-percent increase. Those  who want prosperity must not give away this potential carelessly  -- let alone because of the topic "social issues in the Third  World." This is a very sensitive problem. Developing countries  usually reject interference in their own affairs. Thus, serious  negotiations and not hastily formulated commonplaces are  required.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Jiang Xiaoling (1203 1420 3781)] </F>   [Text] Since the promulgation of the "Copyright Law" three  years ago, Shanghai has achieved gratifying results in  foreign-related copyright business and cooperative publication.  According to incomplete statistics, Shanghai's 25 publishing  houses have established business relations with nearly 100  publishing organizations in 13 foreign countries including  Japan, the United States, and Britain as well as in the Hong  Kong and Taiwan regions in the 1991-1993 period. During these  three years, nearly 300 agreements for copyright business and  cooperative publication were signed, involving 375 books.  Starting from 1993, a new trend appeared in foreign-related  copyright business -- the number of purchased foreign copyrights  increased. Last year alone, some publishing houses in Shanghai  signed 67 agreements for purchasing foreign copyrights involving  67 books. Most of the foreign companies owning these copyrights  are located in the United States.    While carrying out the "Copyright Law," these publishing  houses have encountered many difficulties. The most outstanding  problem was that, after spending a lot of money for the rights  to reproduce books or audio-video products in China, they found  out local publishing houses had already pirated a large amount  of these books or audio-video products, even before the  copyrighted ones were printed or put on the market. This  practice not only infringed on the economic benefits of the  copyright owners but also severely dampened their enthusiasm to  be involved in copyrights from other countries or regions.    Besides, some books published in Shanghai or other places in  China were often found pirated. For example, "Biography of  Jiang Qing" authored by Ye Yonglie, "Chinese Historical Stories"  published by the Shanghai Cultural Publishing House, "Modern  American Spoken Language" and "Contemporary American Colloquial  Language" published by the Shanghai Foreign Language Education  Publishing House, and "Intelligence Training for 365 Nights"  published by the Children's Publishing House were pirated.    Three years have passed since the promulgation of the  "Copyright Law." Why is piracy still on the rise? First,  publicity regarding the "Copyright Law" has not been widespread.  Some publishers who infringed others' copyrights did not know  that their act was illegal. Second, the punishment for  copyright violations is too lenient. According to present  regulations, any person who is convicted of piracy or plagiarism  shall be fined 10,000-100,000 yuan. This amount is very small  compared to the high profits available. No wonder there are  still some lawbreakers willing to take a chance. As a result,  the act of rights infringement cannot be completely checked.  Third, some publishing houses disregarded the law and sold  their authorized books to individual publishers who in turn  published some hot-selling books under new titles for huge  profits.    In view of this situation, relevant personages of Shanghai's  publishing circles and copyright department urged society to pay  attention to the work of giving publicity to and popularizing  the "Copyright Law," saying it is necessary to adopt more  effective legal measures to conscientiously protect the legal  rights and benefits of copyright owners and copyright users. In  this way, China's copyright work can soon reach international  standards.</p>

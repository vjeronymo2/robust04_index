			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / International Company News: Standard Bank to lift payout after 22% rise STANDARD Bank, one of South Africa's two largest banking groups, yesterday announced a 22 per cent increase in attributable income to R625m (Dollars 200m) for 1992 and said it plans to pay a higher dividend. After taking account of a rights issue, scrip dividends and an acquisition issue, earnings per share were 17 per cent up at 593 cents. The overall dividend is going up by 17 per cent to 187 cents per share. The bank said favourable interest margins and asset growth were the main reasons for the upturn. Net interest income rose by 27 per cent to R2.58bn. This reflected improved margins - the high level of liquidity in the system caused the cost of funds to drop - and a 21.4 per cent increase in loans, advances and acceptances. The increased level of advances was the main contributor to the 26.8 per cent increase in assets, to R63.9bn. Mr Eddie Theron, managing director, said asset growth was strongest in home loans, which increased by 49 per cent to R11.9bn. Standard Bank of South Africa lifted its net income by 31 per cent to R506m and Standard Merchant Bank increased profit by 21 per cent to R43m. Bad debts remained at the high level of 1991 and operating costs rose by 29 per cent owing to spending on new foreign operations, staff training, product development and electronic systems. Mr Theron said favourable interest margins in 1993 would allow increased earnings, but at a lower rate than in 1992. Mr Bob Aldworth, the executive director of ABSA who was sacked earlier this week, has admitted in an affidavit that he owes the banking group R414,000. Mr Aldworth had hoped ABSA share options he holds would rise in value sufficiently to allow him to repay the debt. This has not taken place.</p>

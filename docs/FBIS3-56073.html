Arrest of Two Russian Generals:  Analysis and Consequences"]    [Text] Riga -- "The likelihood of an armed conflict was  very real indeed," Foreign Minister Georgs Andrejevs stated in  an interview with Latvian television regarding the seizure in  Riga 10 January of two Russian generals and several military  installations.    The order to arrest Major Generals Anatoliy Vodopyanov and  Nikolay Taylakov, who had arrived to investigate illegal  activities involving the seizure of Russian military  installations, was issued by Andrejs Rucs, leader of Riga's  Vidzeme suburb. That evening Latvian television viewers were  able to watch the moment of the arrest on television: Guards  led away the handcuffed Russian servicemen to a minibus. Then,  escorted by the municipal police, the "prisoners" were taken to  the Latvian-Russian border. They were held somewhere in a  forest where they were threatened and insulted. The area where  this incident took place was cordoned off by armed personnel who  would not even let through a car bearing the diplomatic license  plate of Russian Ambassador Aleksandr Rannikh, who was  threatened with an assault rifle. A protest note about this  incident was later sent to the Latvian Foreign Ministry.    "The damage done to Latvia today, on the eve of the NATO  conference in Brussels and the Yeltsin-Clinton meeting and at  the start of another round of talks with the Russian delegation,  cannot be overestimated," Foreign Ministry head G. Andrejevs  acknowledged.    A delegation headed by Special Envoy Sergey Zotov flew to  Riga from Moscow 10 January in order to clarify the position  regarding the treaty on the withdrawal of Russian troops from  Latvia. It seemed that a rapprochement of positions was  possible which would finally have allowed both parties to sign  documents that are important for both countries. At the airport  Colonel General Leonid Mayorov, commander of the Northwestern  Group of Forces, informed the Russian delegation about what had  happened. After shaking hands with Martins Virsis, head of the  Latvian delegation at the talks, Sergey Zotov informed him that  the negotiations would be postponed until the situation had been  fully investigated, the servicemen released, and explanations  received from the Latvian leadership.    Colonel General Mayorov, commander of the Northwestern Group  of Forces, said that what had happened "is not an incident, it  is an unprecedented provocation." He announced that some  Russian subunits had been moved up to Riga. Defense Minister  Grachev had been notified of what has happened, and he in turn  had informed President Yeltsin of the events in Riga. According  to Mayorov, airborne troops, transport and combat-zone aviation,  and naval units stationed on Russian territory had been placed  on combat alert. Mayorov announced that Latvian President  Guntis Ulmanis, with whom the commander has been in contact in  order to settle the situation, had assumed a constructive  position. Consequently both generals had been released.    President Ulmanis received news of the arrest of the  servicemen during the latest session of the National Security  Council -- this was announced in a statement circulated by the  president's press service. The session was interrupted, and all  security services were issued with a directive to find and  release the detainees. The statement says that A. Rucs had  ordered the guards to resist all attempts to free the generals,  even if the attempts were made by Latvian security services.  The statement terms Rucs' actions "provocative" and says that  he exceeded his powers. It is acknowledged that the conflict  could have resulted in casualties. The Latvian Foreign Ministry  statement gives a similar assessment of the actions taken by  Latvian officials. It is indicated that issues concerning the  withdrawal of Russian troops from Latvia should be resolved  through negotiations.</p>

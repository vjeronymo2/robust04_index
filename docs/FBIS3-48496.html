The U.S. Government  formally informed Seoul in late December that it had decided to  stop using Korean Air's Kimhae depot in the repair and  maintenance of U.S. Air Force aircraft operating in the Pacific  and the Far East.    The South Korean Government responded with a request that  the  U.S. Government reconsider the decision in view of security  cooperation between the two countries, but it is unlikely that  the U.S. Government will comply with the South Korean request  because of the U.S. industry's lobbying for buy-American policy,  sources said.    Korean Air built the depot in question in 1976 chiefly for  the repair and maintenance of U.S. Air Force aircraft, as the  U.S. Government, severing diplomatic relations with Taiwan for  rapprochement with mainland China, wanted Korea to provide  repair and maintenance services to its Air Force in the Pacific  and the Far East. Until then Taiwan had provided the services.  The depot, employing 700 workers, has once accounted for a  maximum 75 percent of the turnover of Korean Air's aircraft and  space department.    A source close to Korean air said that although some  quarters  of the U.S. Government want to continue using Kimhae depot for  the U.S. Air Force in preparation for an emergency, it would be  very hard for the U.S. Government as a whole to change its mind  because it is under heavy pressure of the U.S. aircraft  maintenance industry.    The U.S. Government is considering transferring the repair  and maintenance services for U.S. Air Force aircraft in the  Pacific and the Far East from Korean Air's Kimhae depot to an  aircraft maintenance center in Georgia state which is now on the  verge of bankruptcy.</p>

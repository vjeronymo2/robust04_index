			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Signet pressed for EGM A group of disaffected shareholders at Signet, the jewellery group known formerly as Ratners, yesterday said they would press ahead with plans to force the company into a capital reconstruction. The Delta Dividend Group, based in San Francisco, said it was intending to requisi-tion an extraordinary meeting to consider a wide-ranging overhaul of the share capital. Mr David Gale, president of the group, said the US investors - holding variable term preference shares worth an estimated Dollars 29m (Pounds 18.7m) - would stop their action only if the company issued a statement setting out proposals for restructuring and repaying dividend arrears. Preference dividends have not been paid since early 1992, and arrears in the 12 months to January 29 this year stood at Pounds 58m (Pounds 30.3m). Signet said it was preparing an imminent response to the issues raised by the US shareholders.</p>

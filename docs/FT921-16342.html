			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / International Company News: KL plantation group advances KUALA Lumpur Kepong, one of Malaysia's largest plantation groups, has reported a small rise in pre-tax profits to MDollars 85.5m (USDollars 31.4m) for the year to September, from MDollars 84.8m a year earlier, writes Lim Siong Hoon in Kuala Lumpur. The improved results were attributed to higher palm oil prices, which helped lift turnover by 7.2 per cent to MDollars 381m from MDollars 356m. The group net operating margin declined, however, from 17.7 per cent to 17 per cent of turnover while the net return on equity capital stood at 5.9 per cent, compared with 5.8 per cent previously.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Video report from Murmansk by correspondent G. Smirnova; </F> from the ``Vesti'' newscast]    [Text] Russian President Boris Yeltsin has instructed  Gosatomnadzor [state body supervising nuclear and radiation  safety] to carry out preventative checks at all nuclear power  enterprises where there is a potential danger of radiation.    Smirnova: A detailed inspection has just been  finished at the Atomflot [nuclear fleet] technological repair  yard. An authoritative Gosatomnadzor commission inspected the  workshops, mooring lines, offices and, particularly carefully,  the (Imandra) floating technical base, to which nuclear fuel was  being delivered at the time.    The commission had no serious complaints about the work of  the enterprise's personnel. Its main conclusion coincided with  the opinion of experts of the Russian-Norwegian expedition which  studied radioactive pollution in the northern seas. A year ago  they visited the technological repair yard of the nuclear  ice-breaker fleet and also reached the conclusion that the  system of ensuring nuclear and radioactive control there  corresponds to all requirements and norms of radioactive safety.

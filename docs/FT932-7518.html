			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Arts: Lottery, a hollow gamble - Off the Wall THE Lottery Bill arrives in the Lords next week. It should pass through unscathed: indeed it might acquire some extra weight if their Lordships approve an amendment which makes the Lottery a charitable foundation and frees it from political influence. But although there is no doubting its long term importance to the arts and heritage (to say nothing of sport, charities and the Millennium Fund), in the short term the Lottery is having a malevolent influence. It is setting arts organisations against each other as they jockey for position, under pressure to make their case for Lottery cash. Has the Royal Opera House gone off too soon with its plea for Pounds 45m for its rebuilding programme? Can the Tate really walk off with Pounds 50m for its new museum of modern art? What about the proposed Cardiff opera house; the demands of Olympics-chasing Manchester; to say nothing of the V&amp;A, with its buckets to catch the rain, and so on. This week alone there were two more substantial starters - English Heritage anxious for Pounds 15m for the 'new' Stonehenge; and the Theatres Trust seeking a Pounds 30m endowment to patch up our disintegrating theatres. The whole thing is getting out of hand, especially as the organisations (like the Arts Council, the Sports Council, the National Heritage Fund) selected to hand on the money have been advised to plan on an initial honey pot of Pounds 50m a year each, well below earlier estimates. To date the Lottery has excited suspicion, wild scare stories and worry, and raised expectations that cannot be fulfilled. It has also had a deleterious short term impact on funding. The money going eventually to the heritage obviously influenced the government's decision to cut the annual grant of the National Heritage Fund next year from Pounds 12m to Pounds 8.2m, and may well be responsible for the planned Pounds 5m cut in the Arts Council grant for 1994-95. The Council's dramatic policy shift last week, when it seemed prepared to allow established arts companies like the leading theatres and orchestras to rely more on their own talent for revenue raising while subsidy was used to foster the avant-garde and individual artists, could also be a reflection of post-Lottery thinking. The Government's protestations that the Lottery would provide additional revenue for the arts look increasingly hollow. ***** This week even the National Theatre, by any yardstick one of the most successful arts companies in the UK, felt moved to make its pitch. It is not greedy: it is seeking a million or so to do boring but essential maintenance work, and to extend the Theatre out towards the Thames, creating a new entrance and more retailing space. It would also like to clean its concrete. In the wider context, the National is worried that government cash, through the Arts Council, might be drying up. This lies behind its decision to present fewer new productions in 1993-94. Between now and next March only one new play will appear in the Olivier, The Absence of War, the third part of David Hare's trilogy about modern Britain. (On five Saturdays in the autumn you can see them all on one day for Pounds 45). The Lyttelton newcomers are reduced to a revival next month of John Osborne's Inadmissible Evidence, and, in the autumn, the re-discovery of the American writer Sophie Treadwell's Machinal, described as a feminist thriller and a great hit in the 1920s. The Cottesloe is busier with Lord of the Flies, Angels in America Part II, and Alice in Wonderland among others. But throughout the arts world at the moment there is unprecedented gloom about the future as companies face the quadruple whammy - falling box office revenue, scarcer sponsorship, less local authority funding, and now the likelihood of Arts Council cuts. ***** After years hidden from view, presumably in Christie's south London warehouse, there are rumours that Canova's famed marble of 'The Three Graces' is about to make a sensational reappearance. The Phillips family of Luton Hoo, where the Canova held pride of place in the sculpture gallery, acting through a Cayman Islands investment company, sold the sculpture to the Getty Museum in Malibu for Pounds 7.9m early in 1990. But the heritage lobby mounted a spirited fight and Mr Nicholas Ridley put an indefinite block on the export of this prime slice of neo-classical statuary. His idea was that the reclusive Barclay twins should buy it on the understanding that the Graces went on show at the V&amp;A for 25 years. But the vendors refused to sell it to the Barclays, and presumably planned to offer it again on the market in a more favourable climate. The Getty withdrew its interest long ago, as did the Barclays, but the Canova has probably held its price pretty well, and if the Cayman Trust has conjured up a new buyer now is the time to apply again for an export licence. The National Heritage Fund is almost down to its last million and faces a cut of Pounds 4m in its grant next year. It is in no position to lead the campaign to save the Canova for the UK. The last line of defence is the Heritage Secretary, Mr Peter Brooke. He has few victories to his credit as a Minister so could gain some easy kudos by holding firm and keeping the export stop in place.</p>

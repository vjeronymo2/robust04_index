In addition, conforming changes would be made to the rules and regulations issued under the Plan and the rules of practice for petitions. Furthermore, the Department is announcing that a referendum will be conducted among eligible producers, handlers, and importers to determine whether they favor the elimination of refunds of assessments and (2) whether they favor the assessment of watermelon imports and the addition of importer members to the National Watermelon Promotion Board (Board). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  In order to be eligible to vote, watermelon producers, handlers, and importers must have produced, handled or imported watermelons during the period from January 1, 1993, to December 31, 1993 (representative period).

Box 96456, Room 2535&hyph;S, Washington, DC 20090&hyph;6456; telephone (202) 720&hyph;9916. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  This proposed rule would amend the Watermelon Research and Promotion Plan [7 CFR 1210], hereinafter referred as the Plan. The Plan is effective under the Watermelon Research and Promotion Act, as amended by the Watermelon Research and Promotion Improvement Act of 1993 [7 U.S.C. 4901&hyph;4916], hereinafter referred to as the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule has been determined to be not significant for the purposes of Executive Order 12866 and therefore has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. It is not intended to have retroactive effect. This rule would not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under &sect;1650 of the Act, a person subject to the Plan may file a petition with the Secretary stating that the Plan or any provision of the Plan, or any obligation imposed in connection with the Plan, is not in accordance with law and requesting a modification of the Plan or an exemption from the Plan. The petitioner is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After such hearing, the Secretary will make a ruling on the petition. The Act provides that the district courts of the United States in any district in which a person who is a petitioner resides or carries on business are vested with jurisdiction to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, if a complaint for that purpose is filed within 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Flexibility Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are approximately 750 watermelon handlers and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5,000 watermelon producers in the contiguous 48 States of the United States who are subject to the Plan. There are approximately 140 importers of watermelons. Small agricultural service firms are defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $5 million and small agricultural producers are defined as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000. The majority of watermelon handlers, producers, and importers may be classified as small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The changes in the Plan, rules and regulations, and rules of practice for petitions reflect amendments to the Act. The overall economic impact of these proposed changes is not expected to be significant. Including all 50 States and the District of Columbia under the Plan will have little impact. The producer exemption from assessments would be increased from 5 acres to 10 acres. This change would benefit small producers because it would increase the exemption level, and small producers would not have to pay the assessment. The eligibility criteria for determining if a person is a handler or a producer would not have any economic impact. The elimination of refunds may have some impact on a small amount of producers and handlers who are currently entitled to refunds. There will also be a new burden on importers caused by the assessment of imports, but importers are currently benefiting from the activities which promote watermelons without paying assessments. The research and promotion program is expected to continue to benefit producers, handlers, and importers subject to the Plan by expanding and maintaining new and existing markets. Accordingly, the Administrator of AMS has determined that this proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Paperwork Reduction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> [40 U.S.C. chapter 35], the information collection requirements contained in the Plan have previously been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and assigned OMB number 0581&hyph;0093. There would be a new reporting burden on importers but the burden has been already approved by the OMB and assigned OMB control number 0581&hyph;0093. This action adds no additional reporting burden. It has been estimated that it will take an average of 10 minutes for each producer, handler, and importer of watermelons to participate in the voluntary referendum balloting.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the Plan, the National Watermelon Promotion Board (Board) administers a nationally coordinated program of research, development, advertising, and promotion designed to strengthen the watermelon's position in the market place and to establish, maintain, and expand markets for domestic watermelons. This program is financed by assessments on all producers, except those persons engaged in the growing of less than five acres of watermelons, and handlers of watermelons. The Plan specifies that handlers are responsible for collecting and submitting both the producer and handler assessments to the Board, reporting their handling of watermelons, and maintaining records necessary to verify their reporting.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> U.S. production of watermelons is estimated through the use of U.S. shipment statistics. Shipments of U.S.-produced watermelons totaled about 1,895.6 million pounds in 1993,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7 percent less than in 1992. Imports of watermelons in 1993 totalled 343.5 million pounds, an increase of 12 percent. Therefore, domestic production is about six times as great as the volume of imports.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A proposed rule was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on April 14, 1994 [59 FR 17739]. The rule published in April contained the proposed amendments to the Plan, rules and regulations, rules of practice for petitions, and referendum procedures. In order to have the referendum procedures in place for the referendum, the Department decided to separately make final the referendum procedures. Therefore, this proposed rule contains the proposed amendments to the Plan, rules and regulations, and rules of practice for petitions. A final rule published separately in this issue of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  contains the referendum procedures which will be used in the referendum.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The deadline for comments on the proposed amendments published on April 14 was May 16, 1994. Twenty-one comments were received.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Eighteen comments related to this proposed rule. Sixteen commentors stated their support of the proposed amendments to the Plan. They stated that per capita consumption of watermelons is on the increase again and that the National Watermelon Promotion Board (Board) has achieved many successes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two commentors stated that they are not in favor of the Plan and that they were not aware that a refund provision was available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

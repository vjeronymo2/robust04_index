			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / Technology: Institut Merieux Institut Merieux is an archetypal French pharmaceutical company, with its complex corporate structure and mixture of private and public ownership. Rhone-Poulenc, the state-owned chemical group, directly owns 50.8 per cent of Institut Merieux. It owns a further 43 per cent of Merieux's human health care subsidiary, Pasteur Merieux Serums et Vaccins, which includes Connaught, the Canadian vaccine company bought two years ago. Therefore the French government's overall stake in the Merieux vaccine business is 72 per cent. Rhone-Poulenc makes itself felt through the presence of Igor Landau, the group's health care director, on the Institut Merieux board. It has decisions such as mergers and acquisitions. The founding family now owns only 17.7 per cent of Institut Merieux but executive control remains in its hands. Marcel Merieux, a student of Louis Pasteur, started the business in 1897 and handed it on to his son Charles in 1937. Since 1967 the company has been run by Marcel's grandson Alain. At the age of 85, Charles remains honorary chairman and stays in close touch with developments through daily telephone conversations with his son. 'My father gives me a booster call every morning, wherever I am in the world,' Alain says. Charles Merieux makes no secret of his hope that Alain's son Christophe, who qualifies as a doctor this year, will take over in due course. Alain is more circumspect when asked about the succession and insists that it will not be up to him. However, Alain Merieux also believes that the combination of family tradition with Rhone-Poulenc's majority ownership gives the company long-term stability. 'We have no risk of takeover and can devote our efforts to biology. It is clear that we need to become more profitable but we are not forced to emphasise profitability in the short term'.</p>

			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / Finance and the Family: Mercury looks to emerging markets MERCURY Asset Management has become the latest fund management group to launch an emerging markets unit trust. Emerging markets is the catch-all term used for developing countries which are waking up to the benefits of capitalism and financial liberalisation. About 85 per cent of the world's people live in emerging markets but they account for only 40 of the global gross domestic product and 12 per cent of its stock market capitalisation. Whereas the International Monetary Fund is expecting economic growth in the developed world of 2.5 per cent a year over the next five, the prediction for the emerging markets is 6 per cent. The argument, therefore, is that emerging stock markets offer significantly more attractive investment opportunities over the next few years than those in developed nations. And while individual emerging stock markets are highly volatile, a world-wide fund should not be like this because the markets do not move in the same direction at the same time. Already, there are some very successful investment trusts in the field - such as Templeton Emerging Markets - and Prosperity Emerging Markets is the best-performing unit trust in the international equity growth sector over the past five years. Mercury says it is managing Pounds 400m of institutional money in the emerging markets already. Its new fund will start with holdings in Mexico (22 per cent), Malaysia (10 per cent), Hong Kong (9 per cent), Korea (9 per cent), Thailand (6 per cent), Taiwan (6 per cent), Brazil (5.5 per cent), Portugal (5 per cent), Argentina (4 per cent), Indonesia (4 per cent) and others (19.5 per cent). The minimum investment is Pounds 1,000 while the initial charge is 5.75 per cent (discounted by 2 per cent until September 17) and the annual is 1.5.</p>

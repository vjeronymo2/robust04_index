			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / The Lex Column: Southend/Frogmore Yesterday's offer document from Southend Property for Frogmore merely underlines the cheekiness of the Pounds 130m bid. In Southend's favour, its shares have performed twice as well as Frogmore's over the last five years. But the price of bull market aggression is an uncomfortably stretched balance sheet. The cost of servicing the Pounds 100m debenture, for example, may be a fixed 6.9 per cent net; but gross that up and allow for the discount on the issue's flotation, and 10.5 per cent may not look like cheap borrowing in a year or two's time. The combined gearing of 49 per cent - against more than 120 per cent at the moment - offers a convenient way out at Frogmore's expense. Frogmore shareholders might just be prepared to back Southend's judgment if offered attractive terms. But there is no premium for winning control. While the 455p estimate of the target company's net asset value looks reasonable, Southend's bid is calculated on a mere 8 per cent drop in the value of its own property portfolio. It will have to be more generous and throw in at least an element of cash if it is to have any chance of success.</p>

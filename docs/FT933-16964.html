			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / Rise in business travel expected MOST COMPANIES expect business travel to rise this year, but staff will travel in less comfort than during the depths of the recession, a survey carried out by Surrey University for Thomas Cook, the travel agents, has found. The survey of 140 companies found that 77.6 per cent expect to spend more on business travel this year. But the proportion of staff permitted to fly club class will be lower than in previous years. Only 14.9 per cent of the companies surveyed now allow all staff to fly club class throughout the world, compared with 25.4 per cent a year ago. Only 13.4 per cent expect to permit club class flying for all staff in 12 months time. The proportion insisting that all staff fly economy class is now 3 per cent, the same as a year ago. In 12 months, however, 9 per cent of companies say they will be requiring all staff to fly economy. Only 14.9 per cent of companies allow business travellers freely to choose their airline. The Association of British Travel Agents has decided against proposals to reduce its role in spite of a vote in favour by its members. Abta members voted 55 per cent in favour of becoming a purely regulatory body, handling consumer complaints but not representing the industry in negotiations with government. But Abta's national council said the change would require a 75 per cent majority at an extraordinary general meeting.</p>

			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Survey of France (6): Intense pressure - The financial sector faces up to change Anyone flicking through the business sections of the French press over the past few months could be forgiven for thinking that there was only one subject on the financial agenda: Credit Lyonnais. The traumas of Credit Lyonnais, one of Europe's biggest banks and once the star of the French public sector, have been nothing if not dramatic, culminating in its clash with Bernard Tapie, the embattled politician who is one of its largest personal borrowers. Jean Peyrelevade, who was parachuted in last autumn as Credit Lyonnais's new chairman, has secured the government's agreement for a FFr44.9bn rescue package to salvage the bank. He is now struggling to stabilise its finances in time for its eventual privatisation. Yet the Credit Lyonnais crisis is only of a number of important issues now facing the French financial sector. The economic recession has imposed intense pressure on all France's banks and insurers. They now face the challenge of repairing their balance sheets and returning to recovery as the economic environment improves. They are also in the throes of change as a result of the government's privatisation programme. The Balladur administration has already sold off Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP) and Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP). The sale later this year of Assurances Generales de France (AGF) means that yet another force in the financial sector will have been freed from the shackles of state ownership, thereby heralding significant long term changes in its structure and culture. These changes come at a difficult time for the banks and insurers. The recession has not only posed problems at an operational level - depressing the demand for banking credit for the first time since the 1940s and trapping the insurers in a vicious cycle of reduced premium income and rising claims - but has also burdened them with a steep increase in provisions. Both banks and insurers (many of whom have sizable banking subsidiaries) have been forced to make hefty write-downs on declining property prices and on the rising number of business failures. Some companies, notably Suez and Paribas, have also faced falls in the value of their industrial holdings. The economic outlook is now brighter. There is usually a timelag before such an uplift affects credit demand, but conditions in the banking market are already easier. And the insurers are faring better, particularly as they have been protecting profitability for the past year by raising premiums. The prospects for provisioning have also improved. Corporate profits have returned to growth, thereby lessening the pressure on industrial portfolios. The residential property market is already strengthening and the commercial sector has at least stopped deteriorating, thereby promising a reduction in the level of future property provisions. France's financial groups are now turning their attention to strategic issues, notably the trend towards alliances between banks and insurers. These are epitomised by the growing links between BNP and UAP, together with AGF's recent choice of Societe Generale as its banking partner. Another concern is the development of the international interests they assembled in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The banks are concentrating on Europe, where Mr Peyrelevade is keen to develop Credit Lyonnais's recently acquired retail banking network. BNP hopes to build on its cross-shareholding agreement with Germany's Dresdner Bank. The insurers plan to develop their European activities, but also to follow Axa's lead by expanding into Asia. Yet the overweening issue for the French financial sector is the impact of the Balladur government's ambitious privatisations. The share sales orchestrated by the last centre-right administration in the mid-1980s had a dramatic effect on banking (by privatising Societe Generale and Credit Commercial de France) but left insurance almost intact. That has now changed. By the end of this year only one large bank, Credit Lyonnais, and one big insurer, Groupe GAN, will remain under state control. This should end the old ritual whereby the government (directly or indirectly) influenced the financial sector's investment policy or the banks' stance on interest rates. Privatisation also heralds cultural changes for the financial sector. The banks and insurers argue that, as a result of international regulations and competitive pressures, they have effectively operated as private sector companies for some time. But their ability to do so has been inhibited by historic anomalies such as the government's power to hire and fire their chairmen. Those anomalies will be eradicated by their entry into the private sector. At present France's big banks and insurers are still run by the civil servants appointed before privatisation. These appointees will eventually be replaced by professional financiers who will then face the new challenge of steering French finance into a new era - free, with luck, from politically-charged crises such as the turmoil at Credit Lyonnais.</p>

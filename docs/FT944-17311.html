			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / FT Ski Expedition: The little resort on Alloway Street - Arnie Wilson visits Mount Dobson in New Zealand Arnie Wilson and Lucy Dicker are trying to ski every day of 1994 on a round-the-world expedition. At 5.30 in the morning, No 30 Altoway Street, Fairlie, can be resemble Nightmare on Elm Street. Facsimile machines suddenly whir automatically, sending messages to all corners of New Zealand's South Island. Telephones ring. Answering machines are triggered all over the house. At 6 am, a cuckoo clock cuckoos maniacally. The answer machine message echoes down the corridor: 'Conditions above the valley cloud are clear and calm. All facilities are operating. There are 2 cm of new snow on a 2.3-metre base. The main runs are groomed, and there's excellent skiing on packed powder. Chains are required today.' It is the start of another day in the life of Mount Dobson ski resort, south-west of Christchurch in the Southern Alps. Peter and Shirley Foote prefer to start their hectic day from base camp rather than at 5,500 ft. Shirley records two messages every morning in her nightie and triggers the fax machine on its helter-skelter visit to various radio and television stations, sports shops, hotels and lodges. Peter organises staff on the mountains via a short-wave radio and then readies himself for the 15-mile journey there. (While he is doing this, the cuckoo clock - a present from a German coach driver who escorted them on a whistle-stop tour of Europe recently - cuckoos seven times). Few people run ski resorts from their front room, and even fewer simply go out and build their own resort on a virginal mountain. The Footes did it the hard way 15 years ago, becoming involved in a bitter battle with bureaucracy. 'It took us three years just to build the road,' says Foote. 'They wanted us to build more and more culverts. We ended up building 70. Every time we acquiesced over something, they came back with more red tape. We had to take it. It was either just walk away, leaving the resort half-built, or keep on battling. 'Luckily, there were a lot of people who wanted us to succeed as much as the local authorities wanted us to fail. Our solicitors, bank manager and the contractors all said they would wait for their money.' The result is one of the best privately-owned ski fields in New Zealand. It is on good powder days that it really comes into its own. After some unsettled weather, we were due for a good day. We got it at Mt Dobson, our 200th ski area of the expedition. Higher than many of New Zealand's ski fields, the ungroomed terrain can stay light for days. Lucy and I trudged to the very top of the mountain from the highest lift and were greeted with astonishing scenery. Spread all around us, in a gigantic arc, was the cream of the Southern Alps  -reputedly more wide-ranging than those in Europe - and with Mt Cook dominating the skyline. At the end of a magnificent day we skied down the front face of Mt Dobson, which gave us 3,500 vertical feet of non-stop powder. It was the kind of run you dream about: turn after effortless turn, with no end in sight and no need to change direction. Just straight down forever. We felt guilty about those 70 conduits, all built by hand by the Footes. Red tape or not, without them we would have missed one of the most exhilarating descents of our nine months on skis. For each conduit, we had the satisfaction of at least 110 exquisite turns.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                            FACTS AND FIGURES  --------------------------------------------------------------------- September statistics  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Miles skied: 283 (Total since January 1: 2,572) Vertical feet: 320,985 (Total: 2,900,190) Vertical miles: 61 (Total: 552) Miles driven: 2,208 (Total: 25,662) Miles flown: 1,692 (Total: 60,823 Mileage (all means of transport): 3,957 (Total: 90,913) Resorts visited so far: 198.

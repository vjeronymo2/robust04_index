			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Feeling the pinch around the middle: Why some - but not all  -manufacturers' margins are being trimmed As the latest UK business statistics tumble on to desks, economists might hear the echoes of a small corporate squeal. Official figures in the past week have shown that raw materials prices are rising but retail prices are not. Caught in the middle are manufacturers which face the same unenviable choice confronting retailers: can they carry on as before, planning to pass on price rises? Or must they knuckle under in a new business environment in which sale volumes, not profit margins, will distinguish winners from losers? The decisions manufacturers make will influence the inflation rate in coming months and signal whether the government has been successful in persuading industry to develop a low-inflation psyche. The sums behind the dilemma facing companies are stark. Figures from the Central Statistical Office last week showed that the price of raw materials and fuel for manufacturers had risen by 0.8 per cent between May and June, and by 4.4 per cent since January. The main cause appears to be the worldwide surge in commodity prices. Prices of goods leaving factory gates, by contrast, did not rise in June, and have risen by a mere 0.8 per cent since January. Survey evidence suggests most companies expect the pinch to continue. A British Chambers of Commerce survey on Thursday is expected to list input costs as the biggest business worry. But a recent Confederation of British Industry manufacturing survey showed that 79 per cent of manufacturers expected prices to remain flat, or fall, over the next four months. This is in spite of a pick-up in retail sales, as shown in today's CBI distributive trades survey. The main reasons manufacturers have decided not to increase output prices are competition from overseas and the continuing price sensitivity of consumers. A Gallup survey last week showed April's tax rises had not significantly dented consumer confidence, but it is well below pre-recession levels. Consequently, as Ms Kate Barker, chief economist with the CBI, says: 'Companies are not getting margin growth that everyone thought we would this year. Unit labour costs and commodity prices are clearly less favourable than last year.' But as she points out, input prices represent only a small part of the business balance sheet. Commodities, for instance, are estimated to account for about 5 per cent of overall manufacturing costs, whereas labour accounts for up to 40 per cent. At the same time, as Mr Ian Shepherdson, economist at brokers Midland Global Markets points out, profit margins are still at a high level compared with the past 15 years. He estimates manufacturers' margins - defined as the proportion of final prices accounted for by profit  -were just under 22 per cent last month. Some economists believe this means that many companies can hold prices down. As Mr Robin Aspinall of broker Panmure Gordon argues: 'UK companies have had a pretty easy time of it so far. Demand has been picking up, they have trimmed costs, and so you have seen big profit growth.' But others are voicing concern about specific sectors. Economists at brokers Kleinwort Benson, for example, say they are warning their customers to avoid companies dependent on commodities, such as metals, because of the fears of a price squeeze on profits. The problem, though, is that the trail of products in the metal industry - from iron ore through metal package manufacturer to a can of baked beans on a supermarket shelf - shows margins under pressure in some areas, but not others. British Steel, for example, says that its raw materials - principally coal and iron ore - have, if anything, become cheaper in recent months, partly because most are priced in dollars, a currency down 5.7 per cent in value against sterling since January. But British Steel has apparently decided that the market can withstand a price hike, after what it describes as 'a disastrous fall in steel prices in 1990' that reduced average prices by 20 per cent. British Steel product prices have risen by an average of about 13 per cent since January. British Steel's customers are unhappy about this. For example, the cost of tin-plate, made by British Steel and sold to packaging makers such as Carnaud Metal Box, the Anglo-French group, and France's Pechiney has risen this year by 8 per cent, says the UK Metal Packaging Manufacturers Association. Mr Robin Davis, the association's director, says: 'Continental tin-plate suppliers also raised their prices by about 8 per cent this year and our members are not finding it possible to pass on that increase in total.' The main reason manufacturers cannot pass it all on, he says, is the heavy competition in international packaging. Consequently, tin can prices have risen by only about 5 per cent this year, says Mr John Nichols, managing director of HL foods, a subsidiary of the Hillsdown food manufacturing company. Similarly, the buyers of cans - the food 'packer-fillers', such as Hillsdown  -have not been able to pass on all of their increased costs. 'Can prices have gone up, bean prices have gone up, but our prices have not yet gone up,' says Mr Nichols. He says cheap imports of canned foods and supermarket price wars have all acted to constrain the prices his company charges. But if the steel products manufacturing chain provides some evidence that a crunch on profit margins has begun in parts of the manufacturing chain, the picture is not as clear in other sectors, such as oil-based products. The oil price has risen by about 20 per cent in sterling terms since the beginning of this year, leading to similar rises in the price of the main raw materials for the chemicals and plastics industries. German chemicals company BASF, which has plants in the UK and continental Europe, says raw material prices are rising faster than output prices, particularly for naphtha, used to make ethylene and some plastics, cyclohexane, used in fibre manufacture, and methanol, a raw material for glues. But Mr David Glass, of specialist chemicals industry consultancy Chem Systems, says these rises are not hitting the profitability of the chemical industry, because demand is leading to rising volumes. In a capital-intensive industry such as chemicals, the cost of producing an extra tonne is low once a plant is constructed and running. 'The chemicals industry is highly geared to volume, which is improving margins in spite of the fact that naphtha prices have risen so much,' says Mr Glass. In fact, the chemicals industry is having to rely on volume growth to preserve profits, because customers are unwilling to pay more. Mr Stuart Wallis, chief executive of Bowater Packaging, a big plastics user, says: 'We are big enough to say to our suppliers that, until we can raise our own prices, we will not pay more.' Not all companies are big enough to gain from economies of scale and bargaining muscle. As Mr Richard Brown, deputy director of the British Chamber of Commerce, points out, smaller manufacturers often suffer more than the largest groups. The message from the government and many economists is that, with inflation low, manufacturers large and small must learn to thrive without relying on price rises. To a large extent, that adjustment has been taking place for some time. Treasury figures show that the gap between the trend growth rate of input and output prices has been narrowing steadily over the past 20 years. But as Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, admitted last November, adjusting to lower prices and smaller profit margins will not be easy. Many businesses are still looking for returns more suited to a high-inflation era, he argued. These expectations needed to be reduced if Britain was to sustain a low-inflation economic recovery, he insisted. At the time, his comments piqued some manufacturers. But rising raw materials prices are forcing businesses to think again. The next few months will reveal the choice made by industrialists, and the effects of that choice on UK industrial health.</p>

			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / Personal View: Mobilising the long-term jobless Recent proposals to meet the continuing prospect of 3m unemployed in the UK have focused on the labour market and in particular on making the long-term unemployed more attractive to employers via subsidies. The long-term unemployed now make up almost 1.1m of the 2.91m jobless total announced yesterday. Therefore they do bear a disproportionate part of the burden of mass joblessness. It is hard to believe, however, that the fundamental block on expansion of the economy lies in the capacity for useful work of those now unemployed. With a rapid expansion of demand, employment would rise rapidly just as it did in the late 1980s; without it, improvements in the job market would be meagre. The prospects for an expansion of demand are much less favourable than a decade ago. The legacy of a boom, based on an explosion of private sector credit, is still being digested. The traditional Keynesian policy of fiscal expansion appears to be ruled out by the size of the budget deficit. The balance of payments is very precarious, with the overseas deficit projected at 4 per cent of gross domestic product this year and next; with a marginal propensity to import of 40 per cent, a fast enough expansion to provide work for large numbers would lead to an unsustainable deterioration in the current account. A Europe-wide expansion would ease the payments problems of individual countries, but seems a distant prospect. Supply-side policies to bolster the traded-goods sector, as advocated by the Labour party, would at best be very slow to take effect. Does the balance of payments constraint imply a ceiling on the generation of jobs? Not necessarily. Expanding employment in the public services and on infrastructural investment involves few additional imports. The removal of people from dole queues into work would increase their purchasing power. If total consumption expanded, according to the classic 'multiplier', imports would increase rapidly. To prevent this, the gains in purchasing power of those who find jobs must be transferred from other consumers. This would be achieved by the government expenditure being financed by increased taxation. Those presently at work would suffer some cut in consumption, balanced by gains for those currently unemployed. Thus there would be no increase in imports for personal consumption. If balance of payments weakness rules out expanding demand across the board, then Keynes's 'How to pay for the war' - where he analysed how to restrain consumption while employment was expanded in the munitions industries and the armed forces - should be reconsidered. With import controls no longer a credible option, and with the likelihood that trading partners would object equally to further substantial real depreciations, the only feasible approach is to target expansion on the least import intensive sectors - public works and public services. But isn't a rapid rise in employment, combined with tax increases to restrain personal consumption, a recipe for faster inflation? Evading the balance of payments constraint is of little help if another barrier, inflation, is thereby critically breached. The cost to the exchequer of unemployment (benefits paid and tax lost) means that the net cost of expanding public service employment (in terms of higher tax rates and thus reduced consumption of those already employed) is far less than the gross cost. With strong support for improved public services, holding back the growth of real consumption may not be seriously inflationary. The issue is whether popular support can be gained for a policy of eliminating mass unemployment. The costs of doing so will have to be quite broadly borne in terms of restraint on personal consumption, though the benefits from improved public services extend far beyond those who find jobs. In the early 1940s, people were prepared to accept much more severe restraint on their consumption in order to further the war effort; an important lesson from that experience is that sacrifices must be seen to be fairly distributed. The fundamental point is that a significant expansion of public expenditure, with progressive increases in taxation and savings on the dole providing the finance, is a straightforward and predictable way of tackling mass unemployment. Indeed, under present circumstances, it is probably the only way.

			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / International Company News: Charges hold Imasco to 13% gain in profits Imasco, the financial services, tobacco, fast food and retailing group, missed its target of 15 per cent growth in profit last year because of special charges. Imasco, which is 40 per cent controlled by BAT Industries of the UK, owns Canada's biggest trust company, which is now transforming itself into a bank. It manages CDollars 105bn (USDollars 79bn) in assets. Fourth-quarter net profit was CDollars 125m, or CDollars 1.02 a share, up 13 per cent from CDollars 104m, or 88 cents a share a year earlier. Net revenues were little changed at CDollars 2.4bn. For the full year, profit was CDollars 409m, or CDollars 3.26, up 7 per cent from CDollars 380m, or CDollars 2.97, on net revenues of CDollars 7.9bn, little changed. However, if special charges incurred in the sale of a US fast-food unit are deducted, earnings would have been up about 14 per cent last year. Tobacco products continued to be the biggest single contributor in 1993, followed by financial services, retailing, US fast-food and property. For the full year, financial services were lower and fast-food improved, as did the drug-store group. The UCS retail chain continued to lose money.</p>

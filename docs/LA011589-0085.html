			<p><P> January 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.B. PLANS TO NOTIFY MORE PEOPLE ABOUT NEW DEVELOPMENTS  </P> <P> Responding to complaints that residents sometimes don't know that a new  development is planned for their area until the bulldozers show up, city  officials are devising guidelines that would greatly increase the number of  people who receive official notice of a proposed project.  </P> <P> The Planning Commission last week expressed general support of a proposed  expansion of zoning-related public notice requirements, although the commission  will not vote on the matter until next month.  </P> <P> As regulations now stand, property owners within 300 feet of a proposed  development site are given notice of Planning Commission hearings on the  project. The commission is considering extending that to 500 feet and notifying  renters as well as property owners, among other changes.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Number of Revisions  </P> <P> Just extending the distance to 500 feet would quadruple the number of notices  sent out from about 50 to 200, according to a planning staff report. Other  revisions would further boost the number of notices -- all at a cost that would  be borne by the developer, who has to pay for the mailings.  </P> <P> A surge in residential and commercial construction in recent years has roused  neighborhood groups, who have argued that expanded notice requirements would  help them keep abreast of what is going on in their areas.  </P> <P> "The issue here is an issue of citizen participation," said Belmont Heights  community activist Stanley Green, one of several who appealed to the  commissioners to add commercial and residential tenants to notice lists.  </P> <P> "We have to consider people's rights, not just property rights," said Dan  Rosenberg, a persistent critic of the city's apartment growth.  </P> <P> The commission asked staff to return in a month with an evaluation of  suggestions by Commissioner Pat Schauer. She proposed that hearing schedules be  announced on the local public service cable TV channel, that the city run  weekly notice advertisements in the Press-Telegram, notify renters as well as  property owners, and devise a system whereby the required notice distance would  vary according to the scale of a project. Large projects would require more  extensive distribution of notices than small ones.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Day-Care Facility  </P> <P> In other action, the commission for the first time required a developer to open  a day-care facility in his proposed building as a condition of approval.  </P> <P> The day-care facility was part of a package of extras suggested by the  developer in return for permission to add more residential units to his  commercial-condominium complex than normally permitted under the city's zoning  laws, said Planning Director Robert J. Paternoster.  </P> <P> Although a first, Paternoster said the day-care requirement was not an  indication of a new city policy. "We wouldn't have done it if he hadn't offered  it," he said.  </P> <P> The project, slated for the 800 block of Pine Avenue, would include 72  condominiums and 12,000 feet of commercial space. The commission has not taken  final action on the development, but approved several conditions, including one  that the developer lease space in the commercial portion of his building for  operation of a preschool day-care center.  </P></p>

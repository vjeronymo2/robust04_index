			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / Mark Thatcher accused on arms MR MARK THATCHER, son of the former prime minister, was alleged in the Commons yesterday by Mr Tom Dalyell, Labour MP for Linlithgow, to have been 'up to the neck' in selling arms-making equipment to the Iraqis. Mr Dalyell also accused Mr Alan Clark, the former trade minister whose evidence led to the acquittal of the defendants in the Matrix Churchill trial, of not telling the truth to the Commons trade and industry committee. Mr Dalyell, speaking with the protection of parliamentary privilege, said statements made about Mr Thatcher in the Channel 4 programme Dispatches raised questions going to the heart of government and had to be cleared up. He insisted he was not getting at the former prime minister, but suggested Iraq might be forgiven for being surprised by the reaction of the west to its attack on Kuwait. He said the Iraqis knew that Mr Thatcher was 'up to the neck' in selling them arms making equipment. There was a good deal of circumstantial evidence that they had jumped to the conclusion that 'if Mark Thatcher was involved the general policy had the imprimatur of prime ministerial approval'. In the course of posing a series of 'very serious and careful questions,' Mr Dalyell asked whether the government could confirm or deny allegations about a deal made in September 1985 for British arms to be supplied to Saudi Arabia. Had Mr Thatcher been paid Pounds 10m in commission, with a promise of a further Pounds 10m, after the signing of a memorandum of understanding? Mr Dalyell called for a strengthening of the powers of Commons committees after alleging that Mr Clark had played 'ducks and drakes' with the trade and industry committee. Mr Dalyell said 'A lot of his evidence was frankly just not true and not what he must have known to have been the truth'. Mr Douglas Hogg, foreign office minister of state, who stressed that reassesment of relationships with the Arab world was the primary purpose of the debate, ignored the questions about Mr Thatcher.</p>

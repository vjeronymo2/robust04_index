			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / International Company News: Citibank alters HQ CITIBANK, the US banking group, has moved its China headquarters from Hong Kong to Shanghai to strengthen its presence in the expanding Chinese market, writes Tony Walker in Beijing. Mr C. P. Cheng, of Citibank's corporate office in Shanghai, said the re-location would help 'speed-up' the bank's efforts to promote its China business. Citibank, with 35 employees in Shanghai, is focusing on its corporate business, and is also active in trade financing. Another focus of the bank's activities is to assist in the technical development of the local stock exchange. Citibank, which is the sole cash settlement bank for B share trading on the Shanghai Securities Exchange, has been appointed adviser to the exchange's Central Clearing and Registration office. China lifted a ban on foreign financial institutions in 1979. Since then over 130 representative offices and 90 bank branches have set up in China.</p>

			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Government Bonds: Treasuries mixed after disappointing auction A SLIGHTLY disappointing afternoon auction of five-year notes left US Treasury prices mixed across the maturity range yesterday after a weaker-than-expected durable goods report had earlier provided market sentiment with a modest boost. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government issue was down  1/8 at 100 7/16 , yielding 7.952 per cent. The two-year note, however, hung on to its gains, and was up  1/16 at 100 1/32 , to carry a yield of 5.716 per cent. The market opened in a positive mood following Tuesday's poor car sales data and the successful two-year auction, and sentiment improved on news of a 0.1 per cent decline in February durable goods. The market had been expecting durable goods to show a rise of about 1.5 per cent, and the unexpectedly weak figure lifted prices across the maturity range. Further into the session, however, news of a 9.3 per cent rise in existing home sales during February put a dent in the market's optimism. Long-dated securities later took a tumble following the sale of Dollars 10.25bn in five-year notes. Although the auction went relatively well, dealers were disappointed by the total number of bids submitted. FRENCH government bonds clawed back more of their lost ground of recent days, helped in particular by a rumour late in the day that Mrs Edith Cresson, the French prime minister, had offered her resignation. That was enough to help the yield on 10-year French OATs fall another couple of basis points against German government bonds, leaving the yield spread at around 66 basis points. Analysts continued to remain generally optimistic that French bonds would improve in the days ahead, as investors came to see that the sell-off ahead of last weekend's local elections had been overdone. Strong economic fundamentals should leave French bonds in at least as good a position as Dutch government bonds, according to one analyst - yet the yield gap between the two had opened up from zero in late January to 35 basis points by the start of this week. That had fallen to 27 basis points by last night. GERMAN government bonds gained on the day as a relaxed stance from the Bundesbank in its weekly securities repurchase tender - together with indications that inflation figures for the year to mid-March may come in below expectations - added to the feeling that further interest rises are not in prospect. An early guide to the latest inflation figures came from the state of Baden-Wurttemberg, which reported a 4.6 per cent rise in the year to mid-March, up 0.2 per cent from the previous month. That seemed to point to an overall figure slightly below analysts' forecasts. THE UK gilt market appeared to sink into pre-election torpor, no longer able to raise much enthusiasm to trade on the latest political opinion poll results: these continue to show the mood of the electorate swinging between the two main parties, with a slight leaning towards the Labour party. After the sell-off of the past 10 days, though, there was still room for some improvement in prices, put down largely to efforts by traders who had left themselves short of bonds to square their books. Investors continued to stay out of the market. The gilts future on Liffe traded between 94 19/32 and 94 29/32 , ending the day towards the top end of this range. The benchmark 9 per cent gilts due 2011, which ended on Tuesday night at 95 3/8 , rose further yesterday to 95 1/2 . IN Japan, the wait for a 0.5 percentage point cut in the Official Discount Rate kept government bonds pinned down in their trading range of recent days. The benchmark bond 129 ended the day at a yield of 5.335 per cent.</p>

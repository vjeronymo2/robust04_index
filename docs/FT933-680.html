			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Not a booming Bosendorfer Sir, In his review of the Nash Ensemble's concert at the Wigmore Hall ('Leipzig cramps the Nash', September 24), David Murray referred to the Wigmore Hall's 'big, booming Bosendorfer' and stated that the 'Bosendorfer loomed like a hungry whale'. The piano used at the concert was in fact a Steinway. I have heard the Wigmore Bosendorfer produce some wonderful sounds in Chopin and Schubert and it is ideal for chamber music, but this is typical of the type of prejudice encountered by this great, traditional piano manufacturer. William Lyne, director, Wigmore Hall, 36 Wigmore Street, London W1H 9DF</p>

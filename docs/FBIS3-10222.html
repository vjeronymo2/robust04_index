			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Within the Haitian parliament, the Washington  plan for a settlement of the crisis is a cause of discord among  legislators close to the president-in-exile. The presentation of  the plan has divided the deputies of the National Front For  Change and Democracy Parliamentary Bloc, BP-FNCD, which may  split. It is known that the plan is to be discussed very soon  during a regular session of the Chamber of Deputies. Edner Jean  has filed a report:    [Begin recording] [Jean] For Pierre-Canel Rindal, one of the  people who signed the parliamentary plan, the sequence of steps  of this plan follow a certain political logic. In answer to  criticism from certain colleagues, Rindal, a deputy from  Carrefour, thinks an easy -- lazy -- solution, which consists of  denouncing the paralysis of the Governors Island agreement.  [sentence as heard]    As a statesman and political figure, Rindal says he went to  Washington seeking a well-balanced political equation to unblock  the agreement.    As regards differences on the strategy for the exiled  president's return that are shaking this political bloc, which  is close to Aristide, Rindal, who is an influential member of  the BP-FNCD, thinks that Aristide's return must be crafted by  certain men in situ.    [Rindal, in Creole] I think President Aristide has a  personal  vision of his return. We, as in situ legislators facing a number  of realities, have our own way of effecting the return of  President Aristide. We also think that today, as political  figures, we have come up with a number of formulas with a view  to moving beyond the Governors Island agreement, which is  paralyzed. Our plan does not aim to replace the Governors Island  agreement; rather, it aims to unfreeze the agreement first, so  that the different points of the agreement can make their way.    [Jean] What is the next step?    [Rindal] The next step is the vote by the parliament, so  that  the Governors Island agreement is released and everyone is  accountable for his signature on it.    [Jean] Deputy Fignole Jean-Louis is not willing to ratify  this plan. Moreover, the parliament does not have the authority  to ratify such a plan if it is not presented in the form of a  resolution. Fignole Jean-Louis, who is from Mirebalais and who  is returning from an extended stay abroad for security reasons,  is ready to go over to the opposition and fight this plan, a  plan made entirely in America for the purpose of creating a  favorable atmosphere for applying Article 148 of the  Constitution. Jean-Louis accuses those signing this plan of  tagging along behind certain prime ministers.    [Jean-Louis] We do not yet know exactly what game is being  played right now. The problem is not that they [not further  unidentified] want the president to appoint a prime minister. I  would not have any problem with that. The problem is that there  are a number of proposals that would push President Aristide, as  regards appointing a prime minister. If, however, President  Aristide could appoint a prime minister within the scope of the  Constitution, I do not have a problem with that. The prime  minister they want for President Aristide, however, is a prime  minister they want to impose on him. Even if they have not yet  made the name public, it is a prime minister who tags along  behind certain international powers; that prime minister is  already primed and will be forced to bring about what the people  who primed him want.    [Jean] The other [word indistinct] of BP-FNCD prefers to  play  the role of a firefighter, attempting to contain the various  opinions that risk exacerbating relations among the deputies of  the BP-FNCD. Deputy Serge Jean-Louis rejects any idea of a split  in the BP-FNCD because of the sharp disagreements.    Serge Jean-Louis, who is from Marchand, condemns the  attitude  of most of his colleagues, who are criticizing -- without  reservation -- the FNCD legislators who participated in the  Washington talks. [passage omitted]    One could say that the coming days may perhaps reveal a  number of conflicts of political interest that have always  divided the parliamentary coalition that backs Aristide's  return. The Washington plan, a real seed of discord, risks  drawing a dividing line between the FNCD and Lavalas deputies.  [end recording]</p>

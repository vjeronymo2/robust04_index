			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Survey of South Africa (4): Reform struggles ahead Interview with Thabo Mbeki, deputy president Question: Is there a commitment in society to fundamental change? Answer: One of the things that happened over the past few years, unplanned I think, was because of the length of time that it took from the first official public negotiations to elections, some consensus was built about some things so everybody fell within the same framework. Everybody wants to get rid of apartheid and the consequences of apartheid: there are certain things that are so glaringly bad that there is nobody in the country, whether different parties or different strata of society or whatever who are going to differ about certain basic things. . . but the issue of the transformation of the civil service, for example, is not by any means going to be very easy. There are people who've been in the civil service for a very long time, they know a particular kind of civil service with a particular manner of operating, and you want to change that. I'm sure there is going to be a very big struggle about that. I think theres going to be a very big struggle to change patterns of ownership, management control of the direction of the economy. We might all of us appear to be saying the same thing now, a more equitable distribution of wealth and all of that. But in substance how do you get there? Do you believe there should be legislation to ensure that the corporate sector participates in the reconstruction and development programme? I think you need both moral and political pressure and perhaps in certain instances legislation. It will need to be a mix of measures, it will not be one thing that you do. You might have to pass legislation with regard to some matters, and with regard to other matters you might introduce an incentive system. Do you see power-sharing being entrenched in a final constitution? I think once you have moved some distance with regard to addressing the outstandingly glaring iniquities of the apartheid system and that's gone and society looks a little better, it's not so divided. . . this must result in people beginning to focus on what might be ideological, political, philosophical differences among themselves. You might have alternative strategies for growth, for all sorts of things. The parties which could unite against apartheid and maintain that unity when dealing with the consequences of apartheid, once you have gone beyond a certain threshold people in the same party find that they have different ideas. . . and you get a new political alignment. I think that is inevitable.</p>

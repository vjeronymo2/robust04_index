			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Springboard for a jump into international markets - Jacobs Engineering's ambitions for the future of Humphreys &amp; Glasgow THE RECENT purchase of Humphreys &amp; Glasgow, one of the most famous names among UK process plant contractors, has given Jacobs Engineering Group of the US a springboard for its European ambitions. Terms were not disclosed, but the takeover by the eighth largest engineering and construction contractor in the US is the most important in the industry since Trafalgar House acquired Davy in the summer of 1991. The immediate circumstances of the takeovers are different  - Davy was laid low by one disastrous contract while H&amp;G has been struggling to make money in a generally difficult business climate for UK process plant contractors  -but the underlying trends are similar. Big European and US clients, says Mr Noel Watson, Jacobs' president, are investing on both sides of the Atlantic, and want contractors to be able to handle the job wherever it is built. But the relationship only works if the contractor stays close to the customer. The takeover unites two very different companies. H&amp;G, founded 100 years ago, was a private company run for more than 40 years by the eccentric Mr Ambrose Congreve, son-in-law of its founder. It hit problems in the 1970s and was acquired by Enserch, the US energy company, in 1983. Pasadena-based Jacobs, meanwhile, has grown from a one-man consultancy founded by Dr Joseph Jacobs in 1947 to a company with 14,000 employees, and revenues last year of Dollars 1.1bn (Pounds 700m). Publicly-quoted, the company is one of the world's few 'pure plays' for investors in the risky business of E&amp;C contracting. The deal seems to makes sense for both companies. Enserch was a good parent from a financial perspective, says Mr Frank Hart, H&amp;G's managing director, but could not provide the additional benefits of a common process contracting background. Also, the sale in February of H&amp;G's offshore contracting business left the company at 'a pretty uncomfortable size' of about 450 employees, excluding its 40 per cent-owned Indian business, Humphreys &amp; Glasgow Consultants Private. 'Worldwide, the industry is splitting into two, large broadly-based contractors and niche contractors,' says Mr Hart. Mr Watson also sees clear benefits from the takeover. Jacobs has principally been a domestic US contractor, with only 10 per cent of its work coming from overseas, but after a period of unprecedented growth at home Mr Watson now sees stronger growth in Europe, and wants a bigger international market place. A further acquisition on the Continent is a possibility. Jacobs had established an office in the Irish Republic in 1974 after building a plant there for Syntex, the US pharmaceuticals group. But now Mr Watson wants to be able to serve big European clients on their home continent as well as in the US. Similarly, Jacobs wants to follow more of its US clients when they invest in Europe  - such as Intel for which Jacobs is building a Dollars 175m wafer fabrication plant at Kildare. To do this Mr Watson and Mr Hart aim to marry the skills of H&amp;G and Jacobs, so that each can help the other on both sides of the Atlantic. H&amp;G bring Jacobs its expertise in methanol and ammonia technology, while both companies are strong in fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals where the growth prospects are strongest. One of Jacobs' strengths is in environmental engineering and clean-up work. This is a big business in the US and Mr Watson hopes to export the expertise to Europe. Cleaning up sites after military activity is one of Jacobs' specialities, which could be put to use in eastern Germany following the withdrawal of the former Soviet Army. Mr Watson is also keen to win contracts financed by the Dollars 500m that the US Congress has earmarked for environmental clean-up work in the Commonwealth of Independent States. Not all of this will happen overnight, but the process of interchanging skills has already begun, and is a crucial element in improving H&amp;G's financial performance. The Croydon-based company has been losing money for several years  - one reason why Enserch lost patience  - while Jacobs' net earnings have soared from Dollars 6.5m in 1988 to Dollars 26.6m in the year ended September 30. With the integration of the company under way, Mr Hart believes H&amp;G could be in the black from mid-year. Market conditions look like working in the company's favour  - Mr Hart's trip round the UK with Mr Watson suggested customers were showing a little more confidence.</p>

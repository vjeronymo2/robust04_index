He arrived in Lima from  Buenos Aires where he met with Argentine Foreign Minister Guido  Di Tella, representatives of more than 15 news agencies, and  with Cuban singer Silvio Rodriguez. Rodriguez, accompanied by  Anabel Lopez, is to sing in various Argentine provinces. Robaina  said that it was mandatory to meet with Silvio Rodriguez,  because with his art he takes Cuba's reality to thousands of  Argentines who appreciate his music. Robaina added that  Rodriguez' music is also an expression of Cuba's foreign policy.    In Lima, Robaina met with representatives of the LA  REPUBLICA  newspaper, and Cuban Embassy staff and officials. Robaina also  met with a large group of Cubans who work in Peru, over 30  sports trainers, doctors, and other support personnel. Robaina  also met with the Cuban community in Peru, which for over 30  years has maintained an attitude of respect, dialogue, and  understanding with Cuba.    On 11 April, Robaina and his delegation will meet with  Peruvian businessmen at the Banco Continental de Lima. Later on,  high-level meetings will be held between the representatives of  Cuba's and Peru's Foreign Ministries.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Grupo Andes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In determining whether Grupo Andes had a viable home market for the preliminary determination, the Department relied upon the narrative of Grupo Andes's July 22 submission, which indicated that its home market was not viable when, in its appendix to this submission, Grupo Andes provided data which demonstrated that its home market was viable. Thus, although there was data on the record which established that Andes' home market was viable, we did not pursue further Grupo Andes home market sales data for the preliminary determination. Therefore, the Department's initial viability determination for Grupo Andes was erroneous, as was the Department's decision not to take additional action in regard to Grupo Andes' home market sales. Therefore, the Department was left with no option but to preliminarily assign Grupo Andes a margin based on BIA. Because the Department considers its initial unintentional error to be ministerial, and because correction of that error would result in a change of at least 5 absolute percentage points in, but not less than 25 percent of, the preliminary margin for Grupo Andes, that error constitutes a significant ministerial error under proposed 19 CFR 353.15(g)(4) (57 Fed. Reg. 1131, 1132 (January 10, 1992)), the Department's proposed regulation for correcting significant ministerial errors in preliminary antidumping and countervailing duty determinations. The Department thus has determined to amend its preliminary determination to establish a preliminary margin for Grupo Andes based upon its data on the administrative record.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department further will (1) require Grupo Andes to submit its home market sales listing; (2) investigate, if necessary, whether Grupo Andes made home market sales at prices below its cost of production; and (3) conduct verification of all information submitted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Grupo Benilda  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two business days before the Department's preliminary determination, Grupo Benilda filed a pre-verification submission which appeared to contain such extensive additions and corrections to its original response as to constitute an entirely new response. The Department thus determined initially that the submission called into question the integrity of the response as a whole and preliminarily assigned Grupo Benilda a margin based on BIA. Subsequently, the Department has determined that Grupo Benilda's September 8 submission, rather than representing a new response, in fact contained minor data corrections to its response. Because that initial determination in regard to the September 8 submission was an unintentional error which the Department considers to be ministerial, and because correction of that error would lead to a change of at least 5 absolute percentage points in, but not less than 25 percent of, the preliminary margin for Grupo Benilda, that error constitutes a significant ministerial error pursuant to the Department's proposed regulation outlined above. The Department thus has determined to amend its preliminary determination to establish a preliminary margin for Grupo Benilda based upon its data on the administrative record prior to its September 8 submission.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. All Others Rate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Because the preliminary dumping margins for Grupo Andes and Grupo Benilda have changed, the preliminary weighted-average ``all others'' rate has also changed. (See Suspension of Liquidation section of this notice, below.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Use of Third Country Prices/Constructed Value  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For a discussion of the proper basis for Foreign Market Value, see the Department's September 12, 1994, preliminary determination (59 FR 48284, September 20, 1994).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Fair Value Comparisons  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To determine whether sales of fresh cut roses from Colombia to the United States were made at less than fair value, we compared the United States price (USP) to the foreign market value (FMV), as specified in the ``United States Price'' and ``Foreign Market Value'' sections of this notice. For all U.S. prices, we used weighted-average monthly U.S. prices (see the September 12, 1994, concurrence memorandum).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> United States Price  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For sales by both Grupo Andes and Grupo Benilda, we based USP on purchase price, in accordance with section 772(b) of the Trade Act of 1930, as amended (``the Act''), when the subject merchandise was sold to unrelated purchasers in the United States prior to importation and when exporter's sales price (ESP) methodology was not otherwise indicated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

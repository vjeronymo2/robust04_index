			<p><P> July 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TOURISM TRAP  </P> <P> Hats off to Peter S. Greenberg, who in his July 8 article, "How Tourism and the  Environment Are Colliding," hinted at the self-contradictions of the tourism  industry. The article makes clear that too much of a good thing isn't. Nowhere  is this better illustrated than in the case of tourism.  </P> <P> Tourism is a vital part of the economy for both developing and industrialized  countries. However, sometimes the country and visitors to it suffer as a result  of too much promotion. The adverse impact of hypertourism withers the very  essence of a destination. Today you have to search for romance in Venice, dig  for resort-free sand in Hawaii. Even the off-season has been turned on by the  traveling populace.  </P> <P> TONY G.

The joint relocation project is an integral component of the Tchoupitoulas Corridor Project (TCP), a major public works program between state and local governmental agencies, to relieve traffic congestion and to improve access to New Orleans' port facilities. Consummation has been scheduled to take place no earlier than October 24, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> IC is a class I railroad, operating approximately 2,600 miles of rail line in six midwestern states, and NOPB is a class III terminal switching railroad owned by the City of New Orleans. NOPB operates approximately 25 miles of rail line in and around New Orleans. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Within the City of New Orleans, IC and NOPB own and operate adjacent parallel mainlines lying in the city-owned Leake Avenue right-of-way, which is not used as a street or roadway in the project area (Leake Avenue ROW). Part of the TCP involves the reconfiguration of railroad tracks and operations on the Leake Ave ROW. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  IC and NOPB will exchange ownership of certain tracks in the Leake Avenue ROW between Octavia and Jena Streets. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Neither IC nor NOPB owns any of the right-of-way underlying the Leake Avenue trackage. IC and NOPB each possess servitudes from the City of New Orleans to locate and operate rail lines on the Leake Avenue ROW. City officials are in the process of amending city ordinances granting those servitudes to accommodate the rearrangement of IC and NOPB lines and trackage. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the joint project, IC and NOPB propose the following transactions: (1) IC will acquire NOPB's line of railroad along the northern edge of the Leake Avenue ROW between approximately Octavia Street and Valence Street, a distance of approximately .78 miles; (2) NOPB will acquire IC's parallel double track line to the south of the aforementioned line between approximately Octavia Street and Jena Street, a distance of approximately .86 miles; (3) IC will grant NOPB trackage rights over IC's new mainline between a point near Valence Street (station 175+68.09) and the connection with NOPB's locomotive maintenance facility lead track near Upperline Street, including head room (station 163+80), a distance of approximately .23 miles; (4) NOPB will grant IC trackage rights over NOPB's existing River Main between the end of IC's track near Valence Street (station 175+68.09) and the connection with new IC yard lead tracks (station 182+02.44), a distance of approximately .12 miles, and over NOPB's existing parallel City Main between the end of IC's track near Valence Street (station 175+68.09) and the connection with the western Hayes Dockside Warehouse lead track, including head room (station 214+60), a distance of approximately .74 miles; (5) IC will abandon and remove its spur track between station 240+00 and the connection with the eastern Hayes Dockside Warehouse lead track (station 232+37), a distance of approximately .14 miles; and (6) IC and NOPB will perform such incidental construction and relocation of trackage at various locations along the Leake Avenue ROW as necessary to complete the proposed reconfiguration of tracks contemplated under the TCP. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This transaction will simplify rail operations through the affected area and accommodate the goals of the TCP. No shippers will be adversely affected by this relocation or lose access to any rail service currently provided by IC or NOPB. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission will exercise jurisdiction over the abandonment or construction components of a relocation project, and require separate approval or exemption, only where the proposal involves, for example, a change in service to shippers, expansion into new territory, or a change in existing competitive situations. See,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> generally, Denver &amp; R.G.W.R. Co._Jt. Proj._Relocation Over BN, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  4 I.C.C.2d 95 (1987). The Commission has determined that line relocation projects may embrace trackage rights transactions such as the one involved here. See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> D.T.&amp;I.R._Trackage Rights, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  363 I.C.C. 878 (1981). Under these standards, the embraced incidental abandonment, construction, and trackage rights components require no separate approval or exemption when the relocation project, as here, will not disrupt service to shippers and thus qualifies for the class exemption at 49 CFR 1180.2(d)(5). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a condition to the use of this exemption, any employees affected by the trackage rights agreement will be protected by the conditions in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Norfolk and Western Ry. Co._Trackage Rights_BN, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  354 I.C.C. 605 (1978), as modified in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Mendocino Coast Ry., Inc._Lease and Operate, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  360 I.C.C. 653 (1980). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Petitions to revoke the exemption under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) may be filed at any time. The filing of a petition to revoke will not stay the transaction. Pleadings must be filed with the Commission and served on: William C. Sippel, Two Prudential Plaza, 45th Floor, 180 North Stetson Ave., Chicago, IL 60601 and Raymond J. Salassi, Jr., 202 St. Charles Ave., 50th Floor, New Orleans, LA 70170&hyph;5100. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Decided: October 25, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> By the Commission, David M.

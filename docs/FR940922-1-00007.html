Part 701 is revised to clarify the boundaries of when and how much credit or recognition the Library of Congress should appropriately receive when its name, seal, or logo are used in conjunction with a commercial product. It outlines also the current circumstances under which the use of both the name and seals of the Library may be granted and the procedures for doing so. This part combines and revises the provisions set forth in parts 701.35 and 701.36 of 36 CFR Chapter VII. Part 701.36 of 36 CFR Chapter VII, Use of the Seal of the Library of Congress and the Library of Congress Trust Fund Board, will be removed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 36 CFR Part 701  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Libraries, Seals and insignias.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed Regulation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In consideration of the foregoing the Library of Congress proposes to amend Part 701 of 36 CFR to read as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 701_PROCEDURES AND SERVICES  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

The Library requires that a credit line accompany reproductions of images from its collections.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) The size, location, and other attributes of the logo and credit line should be positioned in such a way that they do not imply Library endorsement of the publication unless such endorsement is expressly intended by the Library, as would be the case in copublication or coproduction activities. Use of the Library name or logo in any context suggesting an explicit or implicit endorsement may be approved in only those instances where the Library has sufficient expertise to pass judgment on the subject matter, where that expertise has been engaged or applied, and where the terms of the collaborative undertaking are such that the Library has sufficient control over the publication to make changes necessary to reflect Library expertise.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

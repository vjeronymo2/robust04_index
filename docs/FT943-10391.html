			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / Northern families warmer than southern counterparts Northerners are the most likely to own central heating and microwave ovens while those in the East Midlands have the greatest penchant for refrigerators and video recorders. These facts emerge from the Central Statistical Office's latest family expenditure survey, conducted last year and published today. It examines the patterns of spending of nearly 7,000 households. The survey finds that average weekly spending per household rose 1.8 per cent to Pounds 277 in 1993 from Pounds 272 in 1992. Average gross household weekly income increased 2.9 per cent to Pounds 353 from Pounds 343 in the same period. Food was the single largest item of spending, with the average household paying Pounds 50 a week, up from Pounds 47.66 in 1992. Lower mortgage rates meant that the amount spent on housing fell to Pounds 44.80 a week last year from Pounds 47.36 in 1992. The pattern of spending is broken down by deciles (10 per cent bands) of households in the survey, ranging from the lowest decile, spending an average Pounds 80.35 a week, to the highest, spending an average Pounds 614.21. One of the few items of spending where the absolute level of consumption does not rise with income is tobacco. The third decile (households earning between Pounds 74 and Pounds 110 a week) spend an average Pounds 5.73 a week on tobacco, while the highest 10 per cent of earners spend just Pounds 4.87. The poorest decile of households spend 3.6 per cent of their income on tobacco, the richest 0.8 per cent. The survey shows a continued steady increase in the number of households owning consumer durables. The percentage of households with a car has edged up to 68.6 per cent, from 67.6 per cent in 1992. Those with central heating have risen from 81.8 per cent to 82.5 per cent. There is a small dip in those owning a refrigerator, but only from 99.2 per cent in 1992 to 99.1 per cent last year. According to the survey 48.6 per cent of households owned a tumble dryer in 1993, 61.8 per cent a microwave, 16.3 per cent a dishwasher and 38.5 per cent a CD player. The survey has been conducted since 1957 and is used in policy areas such as calculating the weights for the retail prices index. Going back 25 years, the survey published in 1969 shows how radically the patterns of spending have changed. In 1968 the average household spent about Pounds 6.68 a week on food, or 26.4 per cent of the total. Only 18.1 per cent of the household budget went on food last year. The proportion spent on housing has increased, from 12.7 per cent to 16.2 per cent, while that on tobacco has declined. Family Spending, a Report on the 1993 Family Expenditure Survey. HMSO.

			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / World Trade News: China 'to relax rules' on electricity project returns Beijing is to relax rulings on returns offered to foreign investors in power projects in China. Unofficial guidelines issued at the start of the year, setting a target of 12 per cent, have been lifted to 16 per cent, said Mr Gordon Wu, Hong Kong's civil engineer turned business tycoon, whose own power plant proposals have been put on ice because of the poor returns on offer. Speaking at an FT conference on Asian Electricity in Hong Kong yesterday, Mr Wu said Mr Li Peng, China's prime minister, is now suggesting foreign investors be offered no more than 15 to 16 per cent. 'So he has relented a little, although by international standards it is still a low return,' said Mr Wu. Bankers have been reporting a delay in power plant project financing deals since the start of this year, when it became clear Beijing was planning strict curbs on rates of return. The introduction of schemes of control, offering staggered returns, was also under consideration. In December, Beijing pulled a Dollars 180m (Pounds 121m) financing package put together by Goldman Sachs for an existing power plant in Shandong province. A private placement would have put 30 per cent of the project into foreign hands. Instead, capital is now to be raised on the Hong Kong stock market. It is understood that the level of returns on offer to foreign investors was at least partially behind the decision to scrap the original deal. Mr Wu added that Beijing was being forced to make a more realistic appraisal of foreign investors' expectations. However, he reckoned 16 per cent to be a fair return, if coupled with a short cut through Beijing red tape. Also at the conference, Mr Thomas Marshella, managing director of Moody's Investors Service, referred to a World Bank survey which puts the total cost of power development in Asian developing countries in 1995-99 at Dollars 277bn, with China and India accounting for three quarters of that.</p>

			<p><P> December 6, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> EARNINGS;  </P> <P> GRAND MET PROFITS SURGE 25%  </P> <P> British food and beverages group Grand Metropolitan PLC said today its profits  surged 25% last year, helped by a turnaround at its Burger King fast food  division.  </P> <P> Pretax profits for the year ended Sept. 30 jumped to 919 million pounds ($1.76  billion) from 732 million pounds ($1.41 billion). Revenues edged up to 9.39  billion pounds ($18.12 billion) from 9.30 billion pounds ($17.95 billion).  </P> <P> Burger King, acquired as part of the $5.8-billion takeover of Minneapolis-based  Pillsbury Co. two years ago, doubled its operating profits, to 125 million  pounds ($249 million) from 76 million pounds ($150 million).  </P> <P> Burger King's weak performance had been considered the key factor behind  Pillsbury's takeover, and skeptics believed it might also undermine Grand Met.  </P></p>

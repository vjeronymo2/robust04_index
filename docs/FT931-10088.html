			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / Money Markets: Few hopes for repo SENTIMENT IN both the French and German money markets remained dull yesterday as dealers assumed that another cut in German interest rates might still be some way off, writes James Blitz. The Bundesbank announced that tomorrow's weekly intervention in the German money markets will be by means of variable rate repos for 14 and 28 days. But call money yesterday hovered around the level of 8.60 per cent, suggesting that few dealers expected the lowest accepted bid for funds to fall below the current level of 8.57 per cent. 'There may be a few points off the repo rate,' said one London based dealer, 'but I would be very surprised if it were much more than that.' Last Thursday, the Bundesbank's announcement that it would be holding a press conference after its fortnightly council meeting brought out the rate cut bulls, forcing three-month D-Marks below 8 per cent and the March Euromark contract as high as 92.30. But yesterday, both instruments were back to where they were before the rate cut announcement. Three-month money closed at 8.32 per cent and the March contract finished at 92.02, suggesting that three-month money next month will be at 7.98 per cent. A dealer suggested that this was proving to be a stable level for the contract. Sentiment in the French market remained dull. One-month French francs crept up to 11.75 per cent on the bid side in the early morning, and stayed there for the rest of the day. Three-month rates were also at that level for most of the day. The March French franc contract continued to be sold heavily, dropping 34 basis points before recovering to a close of 88.87. Three-month sterling cash firmed to 6 3/16 per cent from 6 1/8 per cent as the pound slipped on the foreign exchanges. The March sterling contract fell 7 basis points to a low for the day of 94.10 before ending back at 94.17. At this level, it assumes that three-month money at UK Budget time will be at 5.83 per cent. Conditions in the discount market were a great deal easier after a sticky day on Tuesday. The Bank of England forecast a shortage of Pounds 1.1bn at the start of the day, which was completely removed. The overnight rate was seen as low as 2 per cent at around 10am.</p>

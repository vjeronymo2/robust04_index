			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / International Company News: HK hotels group shows strong rise Mandarin Oriental International, the hotel group controlled by Jardine Matheson, yesterday announced a 16 per cent rise in first-half 1994 net earnings, to USDollars 22.6m, from Dollars 19.5m the previous year. Results were boosted by enhanced contributions from the group's two Hong Kong hotels, Mandarin Oriental and The Excelsior. The Hong Kong hotel sector is enjoying a return to better times as visitor arrivals to the colony increase and hotels are pulled down to make way for office blocks, dampening supply. However, increasing competition in other markets - such as Manila and Jakarta - eroded revenues. In May, Mandarin Oriental took over management of The Ritz hotel in London, the group's first presence in Europe. Next year it opens its first hotel in Mexico City. In 1998 a deluxe hotel in Kuala Lumpur is due to open, in which the group is to take a 25 per cent interest. Earnings per share rose 16 per cent to 3.32 US cents from 2.87 US cents. An interim of 1.55 US cents a share is recommended against last year's 1.41 US cents.</p>

			<p><P> March 26, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> NO BILLION FOR PENTAGON: SASSER  </P> <P> The chairman of a Senate panel on military construction said today that a Bush  Administration request for $1.1 billion to renovate the Pentagon is "out of the  question."  </P> <P> Sen. James Sasser (D-Tenn.) acknowledged that the 47-year-old building is in  need of repair but said the Administration's call for $1.1 billion over seven  years would be difficult to heed in a time of shrinking budgets.  </P> <P> "The military construction bill is going to get smaller not larger," Sasser  told Pentagon officials at a Senate hearing. "There's simply no room for such  an undertaking."  </P> <P> The chairman of the Senate Appropriations subcommittee on military construction  faulted past defense secretaries for failing to get the General Services  Administration to provide sufficient funds for the building's upkeep.  </P> <P> "I'm not persuaded that we ought to ask the taxpayers to come up with another  billion dollars to provide new office space for those who work in the Pentagon  and to expand it," Sasser said. "Perhaps it's time to take a hard look at  scaling back some of the Pentagon staff."  </P></p>

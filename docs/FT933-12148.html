			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / Arts: Flapper's Art Deco fantasia restored - Architecture It took five months in 1929 to build the present Savoy Theatre. It was the brain child of Rupert D'Oyly Carte and the theatre opened with a revival of Gilbert and Sullivan's The Gondoliers. The building of the theatre was something of a miracle. The architect was one Frank Tugwell but the real genius behind the fantasy world of the interior was Basil Ionides. He was a design guru - today he is remembered much more for his books on decoration than for any of his completed schemes. A glance at any of his volumes published by Country Life reveals a world of certainties of taste and judgment that today seems very alien. As he wrote at the time: 'It is a curious form of vanity that makes people want to have what other people appreciate rather than what they like themselves.' At the Savoy Theatre, which was revealed in its restored form last week, Ionides had no doubts. He felt that a new theatre in London opening at the end of the flapper era should reflect the brittle American world of Art Deco - glittering and shimmering with a sharp exoticism. When the theatre was destroyed by fire in 1990 the opportunity was seized to restore it exactly as it had been in 1929. English Heritage - an organisation more criticised than blessed, took the right decision when it demanded that the theatre should have the Ionides decorative scheme restored in every possible detail. While no one could claim that the interior that flashed before the audiences at the ballet last week is in every way technically perfect, it is something of a restorer's tour de force. There are three aspects to the restoration that should be critically considered: the quality of the interior decoration, the efficiency of the installation of modern technology, and the overall architectural effect. The architects for the restoration are Sir William Whitfield and Partners, the technics are by Theatre Projects Consultants and the engineers are Max Fordham and Partners. It is not an easy task to combine the virtues of a Grade I listed interior with the demands of modern theatrical machinery, lighting and comfort. At the new Savoy I felt all this had been achieved very effectively bearing in mind the tightness of the site and the wish of the Savoy group to add on a fitness suite to the hotel as part of the rebuilding. The success lies in the architect's reticence. Whitfield Partners have in a way taken a back seat to Basil Ionides, making many of the current improvements practically invisible. Surprisingly, no drawings existed of the 1929 decorative scheme, although there were contemporary photographs and written descriptions. Whitfield Partners are fortunate in having Red Mason on their staff because he is the most dogged and effective architectural researcher in the business. His work at Christ Church, Spitalfields, has been exemplary and at the Savoy Theatre he was not daunted by the lack of evidence. The building accounts make it clear that aluminium leaf was used for the gilding, and the dazzling gold and multi-colour effects were produced by the use of coloured varnishes. The vivid and luxurious carpets were reproduced from tiny scraps that survived the fire. Paint scraping is a fine art today and the extent of the detective work is hard to imagine. A great deal of time was spent in the Victoria and Albert Museum where the sources of much of the decorative motifs were found. An antique Chinese screen in the museum seems to have been the root of many of the Chinoiserie panels around the proscenium. The effect of the steeply raked auditorium is dazzling and many may find it vulgar. Art Deco is an acquired taste. Ionides looked to China, Egypt, Mexico for his sources and then mixed them up with a fashionable angularity that today seems entirely of the 1920s. The drop safety curtain comes as something of a shock, striped as it is in scarlet and orange. It is rumoured that when the theatre opened, members of the audience were encouraged to telephone ahead and select their seat by colour - it was crucial that the flappers' dresses should not clash with the decor. Today our colour sensitivities seem less developed. It is hard to take Ionides seriously when he writes in detail about colour in his book, Colour and Interior Decoration, because we have been so conditioned by architects of the modern movement to think that everything should be white or grey. The joy of the Savoy is that it does bring back colour to interior design in a provocative, sensual and slightly shocking way. It is right for a theatre and right for that mood of excitement before the curtain rises. What the Art Deco moment did achieve, particularly in its more triumphant manifestations in New York, was a sense of stylistic climax, a flash of joy that is rare indeed in architecture and perhaps belongs most of all in the theatre.</p>

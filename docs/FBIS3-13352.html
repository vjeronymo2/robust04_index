[passage omitted].    President Yasir 'Arafat said that his meeting with His  Excellency the President dealt with the deliberations of the UN  Security Council regarding the massacre of the al-Ibrahimi  mosque. In this connection he said that the fact that the  Council has not adopted a resolution seriously affects the  situation inside the occupied territories as a whole. He added  that he had informed President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali of the  aspects of the message he received last night from the U.S.  Secretary of State Mr. Warren Christopher which dealt with the  importance of the continuation and movement forward of the  peace process. President 'Arafat renewed in this regard the  Palestinian stance which stresses the necessity of issuing a  strong resolution by the Security Council which takes into  account the issue of Jerusalem and the condemnation of the  attack on the al-Ibrahimi mosque and the adoption of immediate  international measures to protect the Palestinian people.

			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Floating Norwegian krone may hit ERM NORWAY'S krone was floated yesterday, rekindling concern about a fresh outbreak of international speculation against currencies inside the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM). As a result the krone suffered a 5 per cent devaluation against other European currencies. The Oslo bourse closed up 28 points at 399. The Norwegian central bank's decision brings the country into line with its neighbours, Finland and Sweden who abandoned fixed exchange rates in the autumn. The central bank's overnight lending rate to commercial banks was cut to 11 per cent from 16 per cent. The European Commission in Brussels said that it regretted the Norwegian move. The krone was first pegged to the Ecu on October 19, 1990, within a margin of plus and minus 2.25 per cent from a fixed rate of NKr7.9940 per Ecu. Mr Hermod Skanland, the central bank governor, said the main reason for floating the currency was 'the general lack of trust in fixed exchange rates on the markets'. At the time of the floating of Sweden's krona on November 19 an estimated NKr51bn (Pounds 5bn) flowed out of Norway and only about SKr11bn (Pounds 1bn) returned but it was the onset of krone selling on Wednesday that forced the central bank to act. Mr Torje Osmundssen, director at Norway's employers' association, Noho, said one explanation for the market pressure on the krone in recent days stemmed from the fact that 'the markets cannot distinguish one Nordic economy from another'. Norway is one of the few countries in Europe to meet the tough financial convergence requirements set out in the Maastricht treaty for European economic and monetary union, with a manageable budget deficit and public sector debt as well as low inflation and relatively low interest rate levels. Mr Osmundssen said the floating of the currency was a 'very natural adaptation' since Norway's main trading partners - Britain, Sweden and Finland - had all abandoned a fixed exchange rate for their currencies. The central bank tried to defend the fixed exchange rate of the Norwegian krone against severe pressure by increasing its own overnight lending rate to 16 per cent and limiting commercial bank access to its own overnight borrowing facility. But these measures failed to normalise conditions on the markets. The central bank governor said he had come to the conclusion that a further rise in interest rates would not have stabilised the situation either.</p>

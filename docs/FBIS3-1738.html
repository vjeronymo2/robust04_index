			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, February 26 (CNS)--A police patrol system  is now in place nationwide with 88 medium- and large-sized  cities, including 23 municipalities and provincial capitals,  introducing this practice with a patrol force of 15,000 in  various police units. The practice has enabled the public  security department to have a tight grip on public order and  help create a sense of safety throughout society.    Implementation of the patrol system has in the past two  years  been one of the important measures adopted in various cities for  the restructuring of public security work and for the  strengthening of public order. The police patrol practice has  been adopted in certain areas in Shanghai, Tianjin, Beijing,  Wuhan, Fuzhou, Xian and Shenyang and such patrols are supported  by advanced communications systems enabling a rapid response to  emergencies.    The patrol practice provides a convenience for the public to  report crime to the police and in turn boosts the ability of a  rapid response by the police. Shanghai has a police force of  2,800 specially for patrols, and patrol posts have been erected  in certain areas in the municipality and cover a wide area. The  police can rush to the scene of a problem within three to five  minutes after receiving a report. Police on patrol arrested a  total of 1,986 suspected criminals in Tianjin last year and 5836  criminals were dealt with. Patrolling police helped solve 6,589  cases concerning social order and 1,947 criminal cases while  they settled 15,900 civil disputes and some 100,000 cases where  the public was faced with various kinds of difficulties and  problems. Police patrols in cars were employed last year in  Wuhan, Xian, Hangzhou and Shenzhen with striking success in the  handling of crime reports and showing a rapid response in  combatting various kinds of crime.</p>

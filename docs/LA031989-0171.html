			<p><P> March 19, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> RESTAURANT REVIEW: DINNER ISN'T JUST FOOD AT BRAZIL UP -- IT'S A DIZZYING  CARNIVAL OF CASUALNESS  </P> <P> Here's an actual Brazilian word for you: fafaca. As far as I can tell, it means  "when three or more people talk at the same time." Example: "And then there was  a big fafaca."  </P> <P> This is one lively, casual, pretty disorienting culture we're talking about. My  personal theory is that its qualities go back to all the coffee Brazilians  drink. They'll speak casually of having "a nice soothing cup of coffee before  retiring" -- to help them go to sleep, that is.  </P> <P> Brazil Up in West Hollywood gives something of the proper carnival effect. The  walls are painted in swirling patterns like the famous sidewalks of Sao Paulo,  only in blinding shades of yellow and white. There's a big TV on in one corner  to justify Brazil Up's self-definition as a "Food Video Show," programmed on  some basis that eludes me.  </P> <P> And Brazil Up has certainly got the casualness thing down. Just about the only  appetizer is empada, a cousin of the Spanish empanada. One day it's a little  popover-like muffin with a tiny filling of chicken and hearts of palm; another  day it's a regular muffin generously stuffed with chicken and onions flavored  with parsley.  </P> <P> The entrees are all named after Brazilian tourist attractions such as Ipanema  and Copacabana, except for "Rio Samba," which is named after two tourist  attractions, and Feijoada, which is actually the name of the dish. The entrees  have a tendency to change daily too, unless I've just gotten my orders crossed  on several occasions.  </P> <P> For instance: A new addition to the menu is frango con guiabo, a simple,  enjoyable dish of chicken stewed with okra in a little tomato sauce. It's a  little hard to tell it from Corcovado, which as I had it was chicken stewed  with okra in a little tomato sauce (and with none of the "golden potatoes" the  menu speaks of). I did notice that when I ordered Corcovado, the woman behind  the counter told the cook "galinha," which is simply the word for chicken.  </P> <P> No problem. I ordered a chicken dish, I got a chicken dish. I do wonder whether  there is actually a separate dish called Corcovado and what those golden  potatoes are.  </P> <P> Likewise in the beef department. "Ipanema" is chunks of beef shish kebab with  peas, carrots and onions, served with rice and the bland, crumbly tropical  starch called farofa (according to the menu, that is; I'd swear I got mashed  potato in this instance). Another day I ordered "Copacabana," which was  supposed to be fried breaded beef, but it turned out to be beef shish kebab  again, only juicier this time, with spicier peas and carrots. It was terrific.  </P> <P> I should add that when I ordered "Carioca," it was, as advertised, fried  breaded fish, and that "Rio Samba" was definitely chicken stewed with onion  rings, peas and tomatoes, dashed with vinegar, as the menu promised. True, the  menu says you get either rice or mashed potatoes with it, but somehow I got  both.  </P> <P>  Feijoada, the Brazilian national dish, is basically rice and black beans with  whichever and however many garnishes you feel like adding. As I had it, the  beans contained some big chunks of stewed beef and some bits of sausage. The  garnishes were farofa, that tropical starch of ground manioc root, fried with  bacon. There was also a wonderful crisp fried leaf vegetable, possibly kale,  bright green and slightly tart, and some chunks of peeled orange, of course.  </P> <P> The desserts have the same shifting quality as the entrees, but they are  unusually good. The best is doce de leite, made by cooking condensed milk until  it caramelizes -- more or less a smooth-serve version of caramel candy. Doce de  coco is a homemade chocolate candy, and there's the usual Latin American guava  conserve dessert, goiabada, which sometimes comes with cheese, sometimes  without.  </P> <P> Sometimes there are stranger things, though. There might be doce de aborboro, a  sort of pudding that consists of pureed winter squash flavored with coconut, or  maybe pineapple or zucchini-raisin bran muffins.  </P> <P> Brazil Up is applying for a beer and wine license. In the meantime, the only  beverages it has are coffee, flavored mineral waters and a Brazilian soft drink  said to be made from a fruit called guarana, which tastes like a cherry. The  name of the drink is Antarctica, which makes enough sense for me.  </P> <P>  Suggested dishes: empada, $1.25; Ipanema (beef brochette), $5.75; Rio Samba  (chicken), $4.75; doce de leite, 85 cents.  </P> <P>  Brazil Up, 8276 Santa Monica Blvd., West Hollywood.

In a joint press conference with Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa after a second round of summit talks, Kim said that  South Korea and Japan share a common interest in developing  economic cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region.    Peace and security on the Korean peninsula are essential to  stability in the region, but vestiges of the Cold War still  linger on the peninsula, Kim said.    Kim stated that it is "imperative that neighboring countries  work together toward making North Korea discard its isolationist  policy." He also said it is "imperative that North Korea give  up its suspected nuclear arms development program and return to  the South-North dialogue."    Reporting his agreement with Hosokawa on economic  cooperation  in the East Asian region, Kim noted that both sides agreed the  lopsided bilateral trade imbalance must be resolved.    The president ends a three-day visit to Japan Saturday  afternoon, leaving for Shanghai for talks with Chinese leaders.    Kim said it was "the insincerity of North Korea that brought  about the referral" of the nuclear issue to the United Nations  Security Council.    "Measures should be taken in accordance with the North's  attitude," the president said, suggesting a flexible stance  toward Pyongyang.    Hosokawa stressed the need for a firm and unified response  of  international society to the issue while leaving open a window  for dialogue with North Korea.    The president, in his meeting with Hosokawa on Saturday [26  March], said that instead of suddenly imposing sanctions on  North Korea, countries should begin by calling for the  inspections and promoting the resumption of inter-Korean  dialogue.    "I hope we don't follow the path of isolating the North,"  the  officials quoted him as saying.    Kim told Hosokawa that he was aware that Pyongyang had  conducted some military exercises on February 3, but added that  there did not appear to be anything unusual in the current  situation in North Korea.    Hosokawa, speaking on bilateral trade issues, said he would  do his best to redress the current trade imbalance and will  consider the dispatch on an investment study team to South Korea.</p>

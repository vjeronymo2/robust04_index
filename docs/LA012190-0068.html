			<p><P> January 21, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> TORRANCE STUDENTS CHEER DIVERSITY;  </P> <P> EDUCATION: WEST HIGH SCHOOL SHOWS OFF ITS RICH BLEND OF CULTURES DURING A WEEK  HIGHLIGHTING HOMELAND TRADITIONS.  </P> <P> Titters filled the West High School library as students twisted in their  chairs, casting questioning glances at classmates on the sidelines who were  decked out in fancy costumes that glistened with color.  </P> <P> Their giggles gave way to admiring smiles as two Hungarian students twirled  through a traditional folk dance. Other classmates read a poem in nine  languages about cultural understanding, and the president of the school's Club  International performed an exotic dance wearing an ornate costume from her  native India.  </P> <P> Although they are accustomed to hearing lunchtime conversations conducted in  everything from Hindi and Persian to Korean and Japanese, students said they  had not truly realized how diverse their Torrance campus has become.  </P> <P> That was exactly the point of Cultural Diversity Week, said Club International  President Sona Saha.  </P> <P> "It's been excellent," said Saha, 16, her face and head gleaming with the  garnets, emeralds, pearls and diamonds of her traditional dance jewelry. "We  have so many kids from so many different cultures; we just wanted to show them  what everyone has to offer."  </P> <P> Saha, who moved to the United States from India when she was 8, speaks five  languages fluently, including English without a trace of an accent, and picked  up "a little Danish" as an exchange student to Denmark last year.  </P> <P> Fifteen years ago, West High School students would have been hard-pressed to  put on any kind of cultural show.  </P> <P> Back when Margaret Harrell, now the supervisor of the campus Asian Cultural  Club, began teaching at the school in 1972, its students were "solid  blue-collar white," she said.  </P> <P> Now, nearly half of West High's 1,625 students are members of minority groups.  Assistant Principal Dick Rose said that figure should surpass the 50% mark next  year.  </P> <P> Enrollment in the school's English as a Second Language program has grown from  a dozen students in 1972 to 183 today, representing 64 different countries and  more than 40 different languages.  </P> <P> "We've had really significant changes, and that is one of the main reasons we  give the time to things like this," Harrell said. "We want to be sure that,  instead of hearing, 'These are the outsiders and we're being threatened,' that  we view it as, 'Isn't this great? We're joining the world.' "  </P> <P> Michael Simek, 17, whose family emigrated from Czechoslovakia to Sacramento  five years ago, said he has thrived in West High's diverse ethnic environment.  </P> <P> "I like to travel a lot, and this is like traveling for free," he said. "You  learn so much from everyone. . . . This would never happen in Europe."  </P> <P> For most students, however, culture is rarely an issue.  </P> <P> "We just all hang around together," said Nathan Spann, 16.  </P> <P> "I mean, you know, he's one of my best friends," he said, gesturing toward an  Asian boy standing nearby. Asked whether the friend was Chinese, Japanese or  Korean, Spann frowned.  </P> <P> "I don't know," he said. "Does it matter?"  </P></p>

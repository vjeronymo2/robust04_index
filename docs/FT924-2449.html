			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Travel trade ponders lull before storm: The sector's hopes prior to its busy season ANYONE LOOKING for a quiet spot in London away from the Christmas crowds should try Thomas Cook in Fleet Street. Outside, the grey pavements are crowded with harassed City folk. Inside the travel agency, the staff are friendly and unhurried. At the height of the lunch hour there are three members of the public present: one browsing through brochures, one booking a flight to London for relatives from Belfast, and one talking to counter staff about a holiday. 'Touch wood, it's the lull before the storm,' says Mr Adrian Sneyd, the travel agency chain's regional manager for the City. 'People are now doing their Christmas shopping or whatever. Shortly after Christmas we'll be in peak-season booking mode.' Mr Sneyd insists one should not read too much into the sight of a near-empty agency. Travel companies believe they have proved they can weather the recession better than most industries. Thomas Cook, the UK's second-biggest travel agency chain, says winter bookings are down on last year, particularly to warm destinations, but a strong ski market has limited the drop to 5 per cent. The company's biggest suppliers are also reasonably optimistic. Thomson, the UK's biggest tour operator, says it has sold almost all its Christmas holidays. Airtours, the third-biggest, which last Monday announced profits up 33 per cent, says its winter 1992-93 bookings are ahead of last year. The week before last, Thomas Cook in Fleet Street saw bookings rise by 38 per cent, Mr Sneyd says. He concedes that percentages can be misleading. In the equivalent week last year, the branch booked only 100 holidays. Mr Tim Boyce, a solicitor at Freshfields, the City law firm, has come in to pick up some skiing brochures. Travel industry managers say they have noticed skiers opting for cheaper January dates rather than the peak season of February. Mr Boyce is not sure he will go at all. 'It depends on the price. I'm not sure I can afford it.' Miss Jennifer Lobell, an accountant with Peat Marwick, has come to buy some travellers cheques. She is off this weekend to the Swiss resort of Verbier on a skiing holiday she has organised privately rather than through Thomas Cook. Last year she went skiing for two weeks. This year she is going for only three days. Some say they are not cutting back on their holidays. Mr Edgar Hill, an accountant, says: 'Touch wood, the recession has passed me by.' Heading out of the door with some brochures, he says: 'We went in April last year to Portugal. We're thinking of making a tradition of it.' By 2pm, with the lunch hour over, the one customer who was discussing his holiday half an hour previously has finally made up his mind. Mr Richard Williams, an accountant with Unilever, hands over his credit card and takes possession of his tickets. He is going skiing at the end of this month, but he has booked directly with the resort. All he has bought from Thomas Cook is his ferry crossing to France at a cost of Pounds 150. When Christmas is over the travel companies will start pushing their summer offerings. Mr Sneyd says: 'If you come back in the second week of January, hopefully they'll be stacked to the door.'</p>

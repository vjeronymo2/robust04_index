			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / Letter: Profit in national pride Sir, Your leader, 'Defence of the nation' (July 6), was, as one expects, cool, clear, calm and objective. However, I must take issue with one comment you make: that 'a romantic view of (Britain's) past' should not be the guiding principle of UK defence commitments. Th fundamental flaw is that such a statement ignores the as-yet unquantifiable 'profit' that a nation derives from pride in itself. It is clear from the substantial coverage that the tabloid press gives to the way that 'our boys are the best/bravest. . .' that the constituency that takes pride in the actions and achievements of the UK armed forces in 'far-flung trouble spots' is not made up solely of what one might term 'ageing half-colonels in the home counties'. I hold no brief for the tabloid readership, but it does seem to me that pride in our armed forces and their achievements is one of the things (alas all too few these days) that enhances our fellow countrymen's psychological well-being. This crucial aspect is, of course, unfortunately (and wrongly) not included as a 'credit' in the balance sheets generated by the Treasury's all-knowing computer] Brian H Gill, 261 Grove Street, Deptford Wharf, London SE8 3PZ</p>

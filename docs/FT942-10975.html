			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / Markets: Bank that stuck to banking - The Bottom Line If you are a widow or an orphan, the shares of most banks are not an obvious thing to buy. Their cyclical swings in earnings and habit of wasting any capital they manage to accumulate on disastrous purchases in far-flung parts of the world do not help the cautious investor sleep soundly at night. One bank in which the prudent orphan might invest slipped briefly into the public eye this week. Bank of Scotland, the smallest and most discreet of the clearing banks, published its annual results, more than doubling pre-tax profits to Pounds 268.7m and raising its dividend by 10.5 per cent. Bank of Scotland has been a connoisseurs' bank for about a decade, since its senior directors decided to grow by lending money outside Scotland, establishing 21 branches south of the border. They have since managed to expand their market share of lending, even last year when loan demand was slack. Lending money does not sound too radical a strategy for a bank, but it has become increasingly unusual as others have suffered from bad debts as a result of the last recession. They have instead tried to raise income from other sources such as selling insurance and savings products. But in spite of suffering from some poor lending - notably to property companies in the south-east - Bank of Scotland has retained its faith in banking. It has steadily expanded its balance sheet - its lending rose by 8 per cent last year in contrast to other banks, which had tiny increases. There have been sceptics about Bank of Scotland. Critics have accused it of being capital-hungry as it ploughed the proceeds of three 1980s rights issues into an expansion of lending. This meant that it did not accumulate capital that could finance bumper dividend increases. The bearish view of the bank has dominated from the start of this year when its share price fell from a peak of 246p to yesterday's level of 185p. This was because it was seen to have less spare capital than banks such as Abbey National and Royal Bank of Scotland to give back in dividends. Yet the bank's supporters argue that this argument misses the point. They say that its management's ability to expand interest income steadily and make fewer errors than others underpins Bank of Scotland's ability to guarantee steady - although unexciting - long-term dividend growth. 'I quite like the stock as a long-term, very safe, source of dividends,' says Hugh Pye, an analyst at BZW, Barclays' investment banking arm. He argues that the bank's relative lack of capital is an advantage because it is less likely to waste its money on a poor acquisition. Pye points to Bank of Scotland's ability to carry on growing its loan book in England, and benefit from further reductions in its bad debts. He also says it has plenty of scope to raise income by selling customers other products, which would help to boost staff productivity. Yet reassuring as this may be, Bank of Scotland shares are not a cheap source of dividends. The bank's gross yield was 3.4 per cent yesterday, a slight discount to the FT-A All Share. The sceptical orphan might wonder why he or she should trust any bank more than the average public company. Terry Smith, a banking analyst at Collins Stewart, says that Bank of Scotland has yet to prove that it can generate enough capital through retained earnings to sustain growth both in assets and dividends. He recommended his clients to sell Bank of Scotland shares when they were at 240p. Yet in spite of some scepticism, Smith thinks that this could be the time to reinvest. He says he feels uncomfortable not to have it among his recommended shares. 'It is a well-managed bank, and its shares are never going to fall to the point where they are screamingly cheap,' he says. Even those who are not widows or orphans might think about Bank of Scotland as part of an equity portfolio, according to Pye of BZW. 'It is the sort of thing you should have as a long-term core hold. I see it as something to buy for the kids so that they can keep it for 15 years,' he says.</p>

			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Quayle Munro Quayle Munro Holdings, the Edinburgh-based financial services company which came to the market in June, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 540,000 in the 10 months to June 30, against Pounds 1.15m for the previous year to August 31. However, the company warned that as the figures related mainly to East of Scotland Industrial Investments before its merger with Quayle they did not provide a meaningful guide to future results. Turnover was Pounds 838,000 (Pounds 1.41m). Earnings per share were 3.71p (5.88p) calculated on the shares in issue before the number was reduced in the capital reorganisation. A final dividend of 3p is proposed for a total of 6p.</p>

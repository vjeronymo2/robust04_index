			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): DAX rises 1.6% after cut in repo rate ACTIVITY was less intense yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT, encouraged by an unexpected cut in the repo rate to 6.80 per cent, gathered momentum, the DAX index closing up 28.35 or 1.6 per cent at 1,843.43. Turnover was DM9bn. Investors are beginning to look at export-sensitive stocks which would be affected by a round of Europe-wide interest rate cuts. However, hopes for lower domestic rates kept the chemical sector, for instance, in positive mood yesterday: Bayer gained DM3.70 to DM294.40, Basf rose DM5.80 to DM256 and Hoechst, a dollar play, DM2.50 to DM273. Volkswagen put on another DM7 to DM355.50, although its public argument with Opel continues afresh, and BMW DM11.50 to 467.50. Allianz, strong on Monday, was even firmer yesterday, rising DM75 to DM2,390. Bayerische Vereinsbank's rise in first half profits lifted the shares DM11.50 to DM467.50. PARIS eased slightly on profit-taking after the heady activity of the last few days. The CAC-40 index closed down 18.45 at 2,110.58. Turnover dropped to FFr4.6bn. Axa rose FFr23 to FFr1,503 while UAP fell FFr18 to FFr606. Elf Aquitaine slipped FFr4.90 to FFr436.70, while Total gained FFr8.60 or 2.8 per cent to FFr314. Canal Plus, subject to downgrades, lost FFr19 to FFr1,211 and CarnaudMetalbox eased FFr5.90 to FFr220.10 on lower first half sales. Strong gains in Polygram and Akzo helped AMSTERDAM rise 2.1 or 1.7 per cent in the CBS Tendency index to 122.9. Polygram gained Fl 3.60 or 6.4 per cent to Fl 59.50 on results, news that it was to acquire Motown records and the decision to issue up to 10m new shares, thereby diluting Philips' stake to 75 per cent from 79.4 per cent. Philips rose Fl 1.50 or 4.8 per cent to Fl 32.60. MILAN continued to test its highs for the year and the Comit index rose 3.70 to 576.51. Opening firmly on hopes for lower interest rates, the market received a subsequent boost from an announcement that the government had dropped its last price controls on bread, milk, cement and fertilisers. Unicem, the cement group added L450 to fix at L7,900 before L8,000 on the kerb, up 7.4 per cent on the day, while Parmalat, the dairy products group added L100 to L1,838. Sip advanced L130 to L3,105 while Stet added L83 to L4,123 on continued strong foreign demand. Olivetti rose L51 or 2.8 per cent to L1,799 and CIR, its parent, added L66 or 4.9 per cent to L1,400 on renewed market speculation of possible benefits from the reorganisation of the Italian telecoms sector. ZURICH rose to an all time high supported by expectations of lower rates. The SMI index rose 30.2 or 1.3 per cent to 2,430.5. Insurers were in demand on the view that they have lagged the market. Winterthur rose SFr30 or 4.6 per cent to SFr 678. Cyclicals were strong, with some investors already looking ahead to earning potential for 1995-96. Ciba-Geigy bearers advanced SFr11 to SFr740 and Holderbank was SFr24 ahead at SFr775. MADRID recovered early losses in late trade but profit-taking proved more persuasive than an early half point cut in the monthly market rate. The general index shed 1.63 to 271.11. BRUSSELS saw some index-linked late buying help the market up from its lows after profit-taking had erased some of the sharp gains of the previous two sessions. The Bel-20 index dipped 2.17 to 1,342.46 after a day's low of 1,333.93. Glaverbel shed BFr110 or 2.9 per cent to BFr3,690 while SGB fell BFr50 to BFr2,640.

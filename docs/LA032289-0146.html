			<p><P> March 22, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> MEETING OKS HAZARDOUS WASTE PACT  </P> <P> To the ringing applause of delegates, a conference of 117 nations unanimously  adopted a United Nations-sponsored treaty today to check a growing trade in the  disposal of hazardous waste.  </P> <P> Thirty-four nations immediately signed a global convention on waste disposal in  less-developed countries.  </P> <P> The entire conference adopted the U.N.-sponsored treaty by consensus, and U.N.  Undersecretary General Mostafa Tolba said the countries thereby indicated their  intention to sign in the future.  </P> <P> "Our agreement has not halted the commerce in poison," said Tolba, executive  director of the U.N. Environment Program. "But it has signaled the  international resolve to eliminate the menace hazardous wastes pose to the  welfare of our shared environment and to the health of all people."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 12 May (PL) -- Cuban President Fidel Castro  returned to Havana today after participating in the historic  inauguration of Nelson Mandela, South Africa's first black  president.    Castro and the high-level delegation accompanying him  arrived  in Cuba at 2119 GMT and were welcomed by Army General Raul  Castro, vice president of the Council of State and Council of  Ministers and Armed Forces chief, and other ranking leaders.    Fidel Castro's arrival in South Africa on 9 May to attend  Mandela's presidential inauguration ceremony was a milestone in  the traditional ties of friendship and solidarity between Havana  and Africa.    The Cuban president and his entourage held several bilateral  meetings in Pretoria with over 20 statesmen and well-known  figures from Africa and the Middle East. Castro also granted  interviews to various news media from South Africa and other  countries.    Significant and historic were among the descriptives used by  sources close to Fidel Castro in reference to his conversation  with the African National Congress (ANC) leader and new  President Nelson Mandela, to whom Castro expressed Cuba's  resolve to initiate and develop multilateral cooperation.    Another important event was the establishment of diplomatic  relations between both states on 11 May, based on a protocol  signed by Cuban and South African Foreign Ministers Roberto  Robaina and Alfred Nzo, respectively. This, reports indicated,  was the first foreign policy decision of the new ANC government.    Fidel Castro thus concluded a tour that began in Barbados,  where he attended the First World Conference on Sustainable  Development of Small Island States, which ended on 6 May.    At that regional forum, he urged developed nations to stop  polluting the environment and called for the equitable  distribution of wealth in the world to bridge the growing gap  between poor and wealthy states.    After the meeting in the Barbadian capital, where he also  met  with dignitaries and well-known conference attendees, the Cuban  president visited Ghana in western Africa during a technical  stopover en route to South Africa.    His stay in Accra, although brief, was considered official  by  Ghanaian President Jerry John Rawlings, who welcomed Castro at  Katoka Airport for a friendly meeting.    The Cuban delegation, comprised also of National Assembly  President Ricardo Alarcon and Rosa Elena Simeon, minister of  science, technology, and environment, traveled from Pretoria to  Salvador de Bahia, Brazil, which, in July 1993, hosted the Third  Ibero-American Summit.    On that stopover en route to Havana, the head of the Cuban  Revolution also conducted various official activities with the  authorities in Salvador de Bahia, capital of Bahia State, who,  last night, gave a reception in his honor at Ondina Palace,  headquarters of the state government.</p>

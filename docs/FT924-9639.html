			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / International Company News: Tapie in talks on sale of Adidas MR BERNARD Tapie, the French businessman and politician, is said to be holding new discussions on the sale of Adidas, the German sporting goods group controlled by his holding company, following the collapse last month of its proposed sale to Pentland of the UK. The future of Adidas, which is controlled by a German holding company in which Bernard Tapie Finance (BTF) is the majority shareholder, has been shrouded by uncertainty since Pentland withdrew its Pounds 215m (Dollars 329m) offer. Mr Tapie is known to be keen to reduce his business interests in order to rebuild his political career. This summer he was forced to resign from the French cabinet after a seven-week stint as minister of urban affairs because of his involvement in a fraud case. The fraud case has since been settled. Mr Georges Tranchant, the French businessman who bought the case, dropped his suit last weekend after Mr Tapie agreed to an out-of-court settlement, thereby defusing the legal threat to his political prospects. A newspaper report yesterday said Mr Tapie planned to sell Adidas, or to sever his links with BTF, to concentrate on politics again. BTF and Mr Tapie refused to comment on the issue. However, banking sources close to BTF said the report was 'close to the truth'. Since the abandonment of the Pentland offer, US and Japanese sportswear groups have been mooted as potential purchasers for Adidas. Credit Lyonnais, the state-controlled French bank which owns 10 per cent of BTF, has also been cited as a possible investor in Adidas. BTF originally put Adidas up for sale in order to raise capital to pay off the debts incurred by its acquisitions during the 1980s. The sale to Pentland would have eradicated the debt leaving it with a cash surplus. It is now thought to be under renewed financial pressure after the collapse of the Pentland deal and the proposed disposals of the Terraillon weighing machine business and La Vie Claire health food chain.</p>

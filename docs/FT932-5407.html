			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / International Company News: Anglo American promotes its variety show / Examining the South African group's optimistic approach to diversity According to the pundits, Anglo American, South Africa's largest company, should be on the defensive. Three weeks ago Gencor, its rival and the country's next largest mining house, announced amid much applause it would 'unbundle'. Anglo, meanwhile, was criticised for its cautious response and commentators agreed that, more than ever, its raison d'etre in its current shape, should be called into question. However, judging by Anglo's results presentation on Tuesday - held in its smart new office building at 55 Marshall Street, next door to its headquarters in Johannesburg's business district - the company's mood is optimistic. The group was robust about the benefits of diversity - its thinly disguised code for saying it does not agree with unbundling - and Mr Julian Ogilvie Thompson, chairman, was bullish about prospects saying: 'We're a dynamic group with lots of exciting developments before us.' It is notable that many analysts are happy now to go along with Mr Ogilvie Thompson's judgments. Mr Dave Russell, mining analyst at Irish &amp; Menell Rosenberg, the South African stockbroking firm, said: 'I came away feeling this is a sound company. They have top quality assets, top quality people and they're doing the right thing by diversifying geographically and product-wise.' Analysts not only believe that Anglo is in sound shape with good prospects. They also applaud what they describe as a very noticeable trend towards more open communications with the investment community. Considering the torrent of invective that descended on Anglo last August when its associate company De Beers reported its half-year results, this is a remarkable shift in sentiment. It is also a considerable victory for those in the group who have favoured a more open approach. After the De Beers debacle, when the diamond company announced an unexpected reversal of its prospects and forecast a dividend cut, there was no shortage of old-timers in the group crowing: 'We told you so.' Now, in the words of one insider: 'That debate is pretty well resolved. If we're not yet at the level of enthusiasm, we're at least committed to (openness).' Nevertheless, this week's results announcement was clear evidence that Anglo has much to learn in presentation. Although full of information, it remained wooden in delivery and too long. Ironically, the outstanding exception was Mr Graham Boustred, the group's industrial doyen, who discarded prepared scripts to speak with humour and expertise about a wide range of industrial projects. Though the word 'unbundling' was not used in nearly 100 minutes, the entire presentation was structured around a rebuttal of the concept. Or, to state it positively as Anglo did, in defence of the merits of diversity - both in terms of business and geography. According to Mr Ogilvie Thompson, diversity underpinned not only Anglo's results - with attributable profits falling by a less than expected 8 per cent to R1.53bn (Dollars 481m) in the year to March - but also six projects in which it is involved. Clearly, Anglo has taken the view that it cannot win the unbundling battle with words alone. It needs to demonstrate the vitality of its group structure by undertaking innovative projects, both at home and abroad. Certainly the six projects at issue - domestically, the Moab extension to the Vaal Reefs gold mine, the Namakwa heavy mineral sands scheme, and the Columbus stainless steel project with, internationally, the Mantos Blancos copper developments in South America, the Del Monte/Royal food group in Europe and the Zebra high energy battery project in Europe - are an impressive attempt to prove Anglo's case. Mantos Blancos and Columbus are regarded as gems, Namakwa as good while Moab depends on the gold price. Del Monte is clearly a risky diversification for a group that has never been close to the consumer, but Mr Boustred says he is 'extremely optimistic' and that is enough recommendation for most, given his considerable reputation. The Zebra battery scheme, to make high energy batteries that could power electric cars, is the sort of long term, capital intensive development project which only those with deep pockets can contemplate - with the promise of considerable reward. Insiders say that the optimistic mood in the group is a function of having all these projects. Spirits have also been improved by the remarkable resurgence in the share price, off a recent peak of R146, but nearly double last October's low of R74.50. This is mostly a function of investors buying Anglo in order to have exposure to gold, an explanation that suits Anglo well as it again underlines the case for diversity. Though Anglo takes comfort from the view of the market, insiders are anxious to stress they do not reject all the ideas embraced in the unbundling concept. While they reject the argument that the 'dead hand of the centre' stifles initiative and efficiency, they claim to be seriously committed to black economic empowerment. Also, the group has not set its face against restructuring, and believes this would be a natural adjunct if South Africa lifts exchange controls. The big question, though, is to what extent a new government in South Africa would try to force an unbundling. Here Anglo can only say that it has repeatedly made clear its view that it would be economic folly to take the big stick to the country's large groups. That, however, is tomorrow's issue.</p>

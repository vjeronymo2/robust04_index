			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Survey of FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance - Personal Equity Plans (28): A flexible path to a long-term objective - Packaged PEPs / In meeting such commitments as a mortgage or school fees, a Pep has advantages over an endowment policy, if you pick the right kind PERSONAL EQUITY plans have many attractions for those who are saving to meet a long-term commitment, such as a mortgage or school fees. For a start, there is the prospect of tax-free growth and income. This becomes increasingly important as time passes - as the gross income on the plan is reinvested - and as the capital gains edge up above the annual Pounds 5,500 threshold. The fact that the funds are invested in equities may make them subject to short-term fluctuations, but it also means that, in the long term, returns should easily outpace inflation. It should be emphasised straight away that single-company Peps, or Peps containing small numbers of 'risky', stocks should not be used to meet long-term commitments. The danger of a single company's failing is too great. The most suitable plans are based on unit and investment trusts with, if necessary, a top-up of blue-chip shares for those who want to invest more than Pounds 3,000 a year. Provided one has the right kind of Pep, a key advantage is flexibility. Peps are far better in this respect than the most commonly used medium for repaying a mortgage - an endowment policy. With an endowment policy, the cash-in values over the first few years are very low, often less than the amount paid in. This is because a large chunk of the premiums paid by the policyholder goes straight to the salesman's pocket in the form of commission. Even after endowment-policy payments have been made for 10 years or so, the cash-in values may not be very exciting. It is usually better to sell the policy at auction, rather than redeem it at the insurance company. The real value of endowment policies only accrues to those who keep up the payments for the full term and receive the terminal bonus on maturity. In contrast, Peps can be stopped at any time and redeemed for their full value. It is possible, therefore, that, after a long bull market, the value of a Pep will have risen sufficiently to pay off the mortgage early. The homeowner can do so without penalty. However, anyone using a Pep to meet a commitment should be aware of the risks. For a start, there is no absolute guarantee that the Pep will grow sufficiently to pay off the mortgage at the end of the 25-year term, or to pay for the school fees. The chances that it will not do so are fairly slim, given the long-term growth rate achieved by equities, provided that a realistic monthly contribution is made. Indeed, a prolonged period of poor performance from equities could actually lessen the ability of endowment policies to pay off the mortgage or school fee commitment. Nevertheless, this risk may well be a large psychological barrier that prevents many people from using a Pep in this way. There is also the chance that a sudden plunge in the stock market at the end of the mortgage period might sharply reduce the value of the Pep at the wrong moment. An endowment policyholder, by contrast, would be protected by the system of annual bonuses which cannot be revoked. But this problem could be more apparent than real. Assume that an investor had put Pounds 1,000 into a Pep (had one then been available) in 1965. According to Barclays de Zoete Wedd, Pounds 1,000 would have grown to Pounds 37,600 (assuming gross income reinvested, as would occur in a Pep) by the end of 1989. The stock market fell back in 1990, the first calendar-year drop since 1976. Even so, the Pep would still have been worth Pounds 35,000 at the end of 1990 - the difference does not seem significant enough to affect a mortgage repayment. A bigger potential disadvantage of a Pep savings plan is the prospect of a Labour government. The Labour party is unenthusiastic about Peps, which might not survive a John Smith budget - at least, not in their present form. As is the tradition with UK tax changes, previous Pep contributions would not be affected by abolition. But future plan payments might not be eligible for tax relief, so that, in effect, a Pep would convert into a unit or investment trust savings plan. This would not be a complete disaster, because such plans offer very good value for small investors. They would also have the same level of flexibility as a Pep. But the loss of the tax relief would make a dent in the long-term growth rate that one could expect from a plan, and consequently it would probably be necessary to increase the monthly payments in order to meet the long-term commitment. Investors who decide to use a Pep to finance a mortgage, or a school-fees plan, should therefore have sufficient spare income to be able to meet an increase in payments if Labour is elected. The potential disadvantages of Peps - the political and market risks - are certainly real, but one suspects that they have been over-emphasised. Most of those selling long-term savings plans have a great incentive to plug endowment and other life-insurance linked products, because they will receive substantial commissions if they do so. The commissions on a Pep are relatively low by comparison, and this will probably continue to hinder the growth of the packaged Pep market.</p>

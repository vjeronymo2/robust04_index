			<p><P> August 27, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE DEFENDER  </P> <P> One portion of "The Defender" centered on the ethics/lack of ethics involved in  The Times' running a specific story during the Bob's Big Boy murder trial  several years ago. The D.A.'s office maintained that Abramson was using her  husband's (Tim Rutten's) employment to further her own interests.  </P> <P> Bringing the focus back to July, 1989, what could be more unethical than  running Abramson's and Rutten's denials in the Los Angeles Times Magazine?  Whether the charges were true or false, the question remains: Was "The  Defender" an objective/impartial profile or a manipulative whitewash/defense of  The Times?  </P> <P> DAVID R.

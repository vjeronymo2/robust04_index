			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Using the information obtained from these sources and in consultation with the debtors and the experts, FmHA will calculate two values as required by the statute. First, FmHA will determine the loan's ``net recovery'' value. This value represents the current value of the loan if FmHA were to foreclose. Generally, the value is calculated by adding the value of assets securing the loan and subtracting the costs that would be incurred if the loan was foreclosed. Second, FmHA will determine the value of the restructured loan. This value is determined after a proposed plan is developed for the operation of the facility. That is, the operation and/or debt is modified to determine if the debtor can attain a positive cash flow and pay an adjusted debt service payment plus fund the FmHA Reserve Account.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After the restructured loan value and the net recovery value are calculated, FmHA can determine whether the debtor's request for debt restructuring can be approved. As required by the statute, FmHA can approve debt restructuring only if the value of the restructured loan is greater than, or equal to, the net recovery value. Once the Agency reaches this conclusion, the debtor will be notified of the results and given its options. If possible, the debt will be restructured and the facility will continue operations. If the net recovery value is greater than the value of the restructured loan, the debtor may choose to pay off the loan at the reduced net recovery value. If this option is not chosen, the loan likely will be accelerated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, if the debtor's debt is restructured or if the debtor elects to pay off the debt at the net recovery value, then the debtor will be required to execute an Appreciation Recapture Agreement. As explained in the statute, these Agreements allow the Agency to recoup a part or all of the debt that is written down if the debtor's underlying collateral appreciates in value over time and if the debtor sells the collateral within 10 years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Discussion of Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> On January 13, 1993, a proposed rule was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (58 FR 4095) providing for a 30-day review and comment period ending February 12, 1993. Six comments were received.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several respondents stated that the $300,000 limit on the writedown would not be enough to help many debtors and recommended that the rule be amended to remove the writedown limit. The rule is amended to remove the $300,000 limit. The writedown will be limited to the minimum amount necessary to meet the level of the facility's ability to service the debt.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One respondent recommended that the interest rate available under the Rural Rental Housing program, Section 8, which permits loans at rates as low as 1 percent, be extended to include health care facilities located in designated health professional shortage areas. Since FmHA's program regulations do not permit a reduction of interest rates below the poverty line interest rate, FmHA will not reduce the interest rate further.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since publication of the proposed rule, the poverty line interest rate for FmHA and RDA loans changed from 5.0 percent to 4.5 percent. The final rule was changed to reference FmHA Instruction 440.1, Exhibit B, Interest Rates, for FmHA and RDA loans instead of using 5.0 percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The loan servicing options available through this action will result in debt restructuring packages which will provide significant benefit to all rural areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One respondent recommended that the definition of net recovery value be expanded to consider the potential net loss to the community if the facility were sold.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The definition of net recovery value presently emphasizes that the value of the assets should be calculated based upon the facility continuing to operate as a going concern, not merely as an empty building but as a facility continuing to offer health care services to the community it serves. This value can be based on the facility offering health care services which may, or may not, be similar to those offered by the current operators. This is the most practical and accurate method of determining the net recovery value of the facility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One respondent recommended that we add the availability of writedown to servicing regulations without a mandate for a strict servicing regimen to be initiated as soon as a debtor reaches the delinquency time limitations. This respondent stated that a hospital could be offered net recovery buy out and not have the ability to obtain the buy out financing, at which point the Government would be forced to accelerate the loan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FmHA is concerned about maintaining health care in rural areas. There is language in the rule which allows the Agency discretion in such cases. The program is intended to facilitate the continued operation of rural hospitals and health care facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One respondent recommended a waiver of the $300,000 writedown limit when dealing with facilities in designated health professional shortage areas, those which are Medicare waivered acute-care facilities, alternate rural health care delivery models, or facilities associated with related programs that may be approved by appropriate State licensing agencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As stated above, the $300,000 writedown limit has been removed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, the final rule is changed from the proposed rule published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on January 13, 1993, as follows:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Debt writedown.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A one-time reduction of the debt owed to FmHA including principal and interest. This reduction will be the minimum amount necessary to meet the level of the facility's ability to service the debt.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 1956  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accounting, Loan programs_Agricultural, Rural areas. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, Chapter XVIII, title 7, Code of Federal Regulations is amended as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 1956_DEBT SETTLEMENT  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

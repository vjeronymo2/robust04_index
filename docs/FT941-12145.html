			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / Arts: Suave Gallic strings of the Ysaye - Concert Among young and youngish string quartets, an impressive number can date their international careers from the Evian competition in Switzerland. The Ysaye Quartet won it in 1988, and have never looked back. The quartet has reappeared twice at the Wigmore Hall this weekend, as suave and polished as ever. Its Saturday programme might have been designed to honour its namesakes of former times - for Debussy's quartet had its 1893 premiere at the hands of the original Ysaye Quartet, and the solo violinist in the first performance of Chausson's Concert for violin, piano and quartet was Ysaye himself. The guest soloists here were Pierre Amoyal and Pascal Roge, both determined to rescue the fustian stretches of the work with sweeping confidence and flair. Roge in particular aimed at a near-Beethovenian weight: a little more than the Concert will quite bear, in sober truth, but impressive while it lasted. (About 40 minutes, by the end of which Chausson has wrung his material almost dry.) Amoyal soared and dazzled in his best style, and the whole ensemble was seamless. This was the second half of the concert; it reinforced the feeling one had in the first half, that on its own the Ysaye team sounds less perfectly balanced than formerly - its leader needs more weight to make himself felt against the strong viola and cello. That small failing made little difference to the quartet's searching, often very beautiful accounts of the Debussy and of old Faure's intricate, gentle quartet. The players' enunciation was scrupulous. They twinkled softly in Debussy's scherzo instead of dancing, but produced ravishing sounds in all the rich chordal passages. If the Faure was slightly understated (the music is almost secretive), its elaborate weavings and its sideslipping harmonies were always lucid. In Faure's slow movement as in Debussy's, they were at their delicate, faithful best: there was a sense of magical elevation.</p>

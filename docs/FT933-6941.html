			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / Wetlands trade-off backed THE CLINTON administration yesterday threw its weight behind a controversial measure to allow property owners to buy the right to develop protected wetlands with payments to a fund set up to restore other wetland areas, writes Lisa Bransten in Washington. Mitigation banking, as it is known, is part of a plan to protect sensitive lands that provide a home for over a third of endangered species in the US. Officials promised no net loss of US wetlands and hoped the plan would end the stalemate between environmentalist and agricultural and business groups. Offsetting environmental damage in one area with gains elsewhere is gaining currency, with companies able to trade air pollution allowances.</p>

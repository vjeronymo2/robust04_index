			<p><P> May 17, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> MIRA COSTA MEETS NEWPORT HARBOR IN QUARTERFINALS  </P> <P> Top-seeded Mira Costa High will travel to meet Newport Harbor at 7:30 tonight  in the quarterfinals of the Southern Section 4-A boys' volleyball playoffs.  </P> <P> The match was moved up a day because Newport Harbor's prom is Friday night.  </P> <P> "I wouldn't want them laboring under that problem," said Mira Costa Coach Mike  Cook, who had to agree to the change. "If my kids had the prom that night, I  would hope my opponent would allow us to have the game early. Maybe someone  will do me a favor someday."  </P> <P> Newport Harbor (11-5), which won the 4-A title in 1987, is led by setter Alex  Opoulos, freshman outside hitter Mark McAnlis and 6-foot-3 middle blocker Ian  Juberg. The Sailors defeated Leuzinger in the first round Friday, 12-15, 15-4,  15-6, 15-4.  </P> <P> Mira Costa (19-0) advanced with a 15-4, 15-5, 15-6 victory over Dos Pueblos of  Goleta. The Mustangs have four players who have signed with major colleges:  outside hitter David Swatik (UCLA), middle blockers Pat Ivie and Mike  Ashenfelter (USC) and setter Canyon Ceman (Stanford).

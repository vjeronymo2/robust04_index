			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / UK News (Employment): Strikes of under a week seen to benefit workers THE FIRST comprehensive analysis of whether strike action over pay benefited workers during the 1980s has tentatively concluded that it did if the strike lasted one week or less, but did not for the 'average' pay strike of 11 days. An analysis of 9,000 wage settlements by Professor David Metcalf and Mr Jonathon Wadsworth, of the Centre for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics, found that one in 40 involved a strike. In seven out of the 10 years from 1979 to 1989 real wage settlements involving a strike were higher than those without a strike. For the decade as a whole settlements with a dispute were 0.7 per cent higher than those without a dispute. Strikes in coal products (not coal mining, which is not included in the survey) and metal manufacturing were relatively long, and those in metal manufacturing produced settlements on average 4.2 per cent higher than those without strikes. Strikes in electrical engineering and timber yielded, on average, lower real wage increases. The statistical analysis found that striking boosted the annual pay rise by an average of Pounds 45 a year. Assuming that the benefits of a pay rise can be enjoyed for 30 years, and real interest rates remain positive, a three-week strike would be worthwhile even given a daily cost of striking of Pounds 57. The analysis concludes that in the 56 per cent of cases where strikes last a week or less and win gains lasting seven years or more, the benefits will outweigh the costs. However, the 'average' strike in the sample lasted 11 days and that required a wage gain to last 30 years for benefits to equal the cost. The government is unlikely to welcome the finding that strike action can often pay. The authors emphasise, however, that the findings are very tentative and could substantially underestimate or overestimate the costs of strike action. Strikes may, for example, yield higher settlements in subsequent years from a management fearful of a repetition.</p>
